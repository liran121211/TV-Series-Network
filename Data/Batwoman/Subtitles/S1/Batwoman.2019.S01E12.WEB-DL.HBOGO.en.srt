1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,040
This is constructed
of actual human skin?

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,200
Yeah. We've linked DNA on the mask
to dozens of individuals, all dead.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,800
- I'm not following.
- Alice robbed a series

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,080
of morgues a months ago.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,320
We think she was stealing skin off
corpses to help Mouse make that mask

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,840
so he could impersonate
Commander Kane

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,440
and kill Catherine in the
process.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,720
Look, Dr. Campbell, your name carries
a lot of weight in this city.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,440
We could really use your testimony.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,800
I agree there's a definite
likeness to you.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,360
But, the notion of a man crafting
a mask out of different skins

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,640
to perfectly resemble
the face of another man

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,200
and pulling it off convincingly,
this...

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,440
Is science fiction.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,120
Right now,
we have an innocent man in prison

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,400
and a murderer in custody
who's refusing to talk.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,080
Doctor, if there's any
way you can help with this...

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,280
You say you have, this Mouse
character under lock and key?

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,120
Yeah. We got him on 24-hour watch
in Gotham General.

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,360
I'll need to meet him.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,520
I'll run a few tests and if they
convince me this is possible...

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,880
Then I'll sign
the affidavit testifying

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,960
that an innocent man
could have been framed.

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,200
Thank you, Dr. Campbell.

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,920
I hope I can get you
out of here. I really do.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,960
We need you back at headquarters.

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,280
Don't doubt yourself.

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,880
- You'll find Alice.
- If I don't...

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,360
Her next victim is on me.

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,000
You wanna prove to this city

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,120
from Alice to every two-bit
criminal wannabe

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,680
that you're a force
to be reckoned with?

34
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,600
Well, then, you... you eliminate
the threat, at any cost.

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,880
Go, go, go.
Move, move, move.

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,640
Honestly, I don't know
who's a bigger threat to Gotham...

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Alice...

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
Or us...

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,160
For letting her get away.

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Hands up!

41
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Don't move.

42
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,920
Show us your hands.

43
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,000
I want her dealt with, for good.

44
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Which is why I'm ordering a B-42.

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,120
- Sure you can do that, Moore?
- It's acting commander.

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
And yes. If you see Alice,
do not hesitate.

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,200
Shoot to kill.

48
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,120
Weird observation, but, Gotham
seemed a lot less bumpy on my Earth.

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
Sorry, Beth.
I'm avoiding checkpoints.

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,960
We need to get you out of town.
Once we get you out

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,720
of The Crows's crosshairs,
we can figure out what's wrong

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,880
with you... Oh, my god.
Your ear.

53
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,600
You're bleeding.
It's getting worse. Speed up.

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
I would love to, Mary,
but slight problem.

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,920
Since when is there
a checkpoint here?

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,200
Guys, I can't exactly turn around.

57
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,400
Tell them I'm going into labor
and we need to get to a hospital.

58
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Have you seen you?

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,640
- I can't breathe.
- Now, what the hell is the problem?

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,520
I'm obviously having an asthma attack
and in need of medical attention...

61
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,440
Okay. I'm sorry. Your asthma
attack's not very believable.

62
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,040
- You're yelling... Stop!
- Why can't you just lie?

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
- Guys!
- Yeah, we're screwed.

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,600
- Under the blanket. Go, go, go.
- Okay.

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,800
- It's tight.
- Guys, guys, guys, I gotta stop.

66
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,360
Look, not to pull the whole,
"Do you know who my father is?"

67
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,080
but maybe the reason Alice

68
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,560
escaped your custody
in the first place

69
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,320
is because the Crows have a tendency
of overlooking minor details

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,080
like, "Hi, my dad is your boss."

71
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,840
- Miss Hamilton.
- Exactly.

72
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,640
So if you could tell your boys
to stand down.

73
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,240
- Just trying to do our job, ma'am.
- And we so do appreciate it.

74
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Go Gotham.

75
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Okay, I need you
to step out of the car.

76
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
That was my Yorkie.

77
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
Automatic weapons are
giving him anxiety.

78
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Get out of the damn car!

79
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,960
Hey, we're cool. Just gonna reach
for my seatbelt, okay?

80
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,000
Any ideas?

81
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,360
Panic?

82
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,320
Step out of the vehicle, ma'am.

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,920
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

84
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,120
Really, we're doing this?

85
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,280
Got someone in the back.

86
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
What's going on?

87
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,320
Halt. Stop!

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Go!

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
<i>Apologies for a late broadcast,
Gotham.</i>

90
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,280
<i>Like many of you,
I was stopped on my way to work</i>

91
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
<i>by Crows agents looking for Alice.</i>

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
<i>On the upside, I'm pretty sure
that involuntary pat-down</i>

93
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,680
<i>counts as my annual mammogram.</i>

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,120
<i>Holy police state, Batwoman.
Can we find her already?</i>

95
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,720
What are we looking for?

96
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,560
{\an5}Now, see, I wouldn't
be caught dead in that uniform.

97
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,520
But I'm glad you were.

98
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,920
{\an5}Hey, you figured it out yet?

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,360
{\an5}No swelling, no pressure build-up.
Her hearing is fine.

100
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,760
{\an5}Hemophilia causes nosebleeds,
but she has no signs of any bruising

101
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,080
{\an5}and it doesn't explain the migraines.

102
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
All of that is to say that no,
I haven't figured it out yet.

103
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,000
But I won't stop until I do.

104
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,000
{\an5}You missed all the fun.
Batwoman showed up and saved us.

105
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,760
Really? That's fortunate.

106
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,480
{\an5}She likes me.
Plus, she kind of owed me one.

107
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Really?

108
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,960
- Okay, problem.
- What?

109
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,960
Her cells are disintegrating
on a molecular level.

110
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,200
{\an5}May I? I'm no expert at multiverses.

111
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,200
{\an5}But you are two credits
shy of astrophysicist.

112
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,800
{\an5}So whatever you're thinking, spill.

113
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,240
{\an5}I've read some theories
on multiple universe hypothesis.

114
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,560
{\an5}Inflation model,
MWI of Quantum Mechanics.

115
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,920
MWI?

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,160
- Many-Worlds Interpretation.
- Many-Worlds Interpretation.

117
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,720
{\an5}Does anyone here
speak real people?

118
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Right.

119
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,520
{\an5}In my research, I theorized that all
of these universes

120
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,800
{\an5}are separated for a reason.

121
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,600
{\an5}If I'm right, it means Alice has one
mother of a headache now too.

122
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,800
{\an5}Collateral damage
from the multiverse collapsing.

123
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,760
{\an5}In other words, this universe is

124
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,120
{\an5}literally not big enough
for the both of us.

125
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,640
{\an5}And the longer
we coexist in this world...

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,360
{\an5}the more we're living
on borrowed time.

127
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,640
Except, we're borrowing it
from each other.

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,040
{\an5}As cells decay, the body goes
haywire. Synaptic misfire.

129
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,800
{\an5}Pain receptors go into overdrive.

130
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,280
{\an5}Until eventually...

131
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,920
If we can't find a way to save you,
you're both gonna die.

132
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,800
{\an5}So not to pile on, but according
to this neurodegeneration program

133
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,960
at this rapid rate
of cell deterioration

134
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
{\an5}"eventually" is about
seven hours from now.

135
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,280
Does alcohol slow down
degeneration or something?

136
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Here.

137
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,680
No, but it gives me a buzz
while I face my mortality.

138
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
You are not going to die, right?

139
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,080
Okay. So, when in your mind

140
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,640
did I become proficient
in extraterrestrial cell decay?

141
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,120
We need to get her to a hospital.

142
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,920
Where the Crows will kill her
before anyone can say "multiverse".

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,280
See? Whiskey.

144
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,040
We have three of the smartest people
in Gotham in this room right now.

145
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,640
Put your heads together
and think of something.

146
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,360
Where are you going?

147
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,520
If Beth is enemy
number one in Gotham,

148
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
then we have to get her
to a hospital outside the city.

149
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,440
Maybe a face-to-face
with this new commander

150
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,120
can help us get past
the check points.

151
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm sorry.
By telling her what, exactly?

152
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,600
- I haven't figured that out yet.
- I have.

153
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,200
It's easy. All you have say
that an event called Crisis

154
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
merged an infinite number
of universes resulting

155
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,440
in Alice's not so-evil twin

156
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,200
from another earth
ending up on this earth.

157
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,880
Just ask Supergirl or the Flash.

158
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,520
And oh, by the way,
I swear, I'm not Batwoman.

159
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,680
Orders to transport the inmate.

160
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,560
- Get away from me.
- Mouse.

161
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,320
It's me, my darling.
I've come to get you out of here.

162
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,120
How are you doing that?

163
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,880
How are you her?

164
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,920
How am I who?
You're speaking nonsense.

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
"The Queen of Hearts,
she made some tarts,

166
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,240
all on a summer day.

167
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,280
The Knave of Hearts,
he stole those tarts," and?

168
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
- Yeah.
- And?

169
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,400
"And took them quite away."
What's wrong with you?

170
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640
- Alice?
- Yes.

171
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,200
- Who the hell else would I be?
- She tricked me.

172
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,160
- Who?
- A girl...

173
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,200
With your face,
and your eyes and your smile.

174
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,960
Alice, she was...
She was you, I swear.

175
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,800
That, that girl and your sister,
they convinced me she was you.

176
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,360
That's how Kate got away,
how I ended up here.

177
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,800
It was a perfect match
and I believed her.

178
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,560
Alice, your ear.

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,800
I do believe you to be right

180
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,600
and something else to be wrong
from beginning to end.

181
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
Why are your ears bleeding?

182
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,920
You have enough on your plate
without having to worry about me.

183
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,240
Where... where are you going?

184
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,480
Change of plans, little Mouse.
I have some digging to do.

185
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,240
And when I find my answers,
I'll be back for you.

186
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,720
I know you will.

187
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,800
<i>Eyes on all the floors.</i>

188
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,640
<i>Dumpsters, rafters, drain pipes.</i>

189
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,840
Remember, she's a sewer rat.

190
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
You ambushed five of my guys

191
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,320
at a checkpoint last night.
Care to explain?

192
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,320
Detaining the former
commander's daughter?

193
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,640
That's a statement. Besides,
what happened to probable cause?

194
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
Alice got away on my watch.

195
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,680
It's on me to find her.

196
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,440
- And it's on me to protect my city.
- Copy that.

197
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,640
So, if the law-breaking vigilante is
done telling me how to do my job...

198
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,600
I should get back to it.

199
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,480
Call off the shoot-to-kill
order on Alice.

200
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,880
Why are you protecting a terrorist,
all of a sudden?

201
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,120
I'm protecting you.

202
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,440
Is this really how you wanna
start your command?

203
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,400
Brushing up innocents?
Unlawful searches?

204
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,040
Your boss is in jail.
You're losing your clients.

205
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,360
And half the city thinks the Crows
are on some kind of power trip.

206
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,920
A manhunt like this
puts innocent lives in jeopardy.

207
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,360
Alice puts innocent lives
in jeopardy.

208
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,720
Then let me find her.

209
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
My way.

210
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,160
- Tell the Crows to stand down.
- Are you crazy?

211
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,240
You once told me you trusted me.

212
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,760
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Commander Moore.</i>

213
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I can't.

214
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,040
Coming back out.

215
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,880
Remember me, commander?

216
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Dodgson.

217
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,320
I take that as a yes.

218
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,840
What about Cryo technology?

219
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,280
Bruce knew a guy
with a Cryogenetic tank.

220
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,440
We freeze your body in cryostasis
and slow the cell deterioration.

221
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,080
So a -196 degree bath
in liquid nitrogen?

222
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,440
- Yeah. That sounds survivable.
- Fair.

223
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,160
Hyperbaric chamber?
We could simulate high altitude

224
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
and increase my red blood cell.

225
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,560
You'll never adapt
to hypoxia in the...

226
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,880
Three hours
and 37 minutes you have left.

227
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,880
It'll probably just kill you faster.

228
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,960
Okay. I'll just keep drinking.

229
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,840
We have to be able to think of
something.

230
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,120
We already have, Luke.

231
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,560
We're both just too polite to say it

232
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,240
because it's the one option
that Kate refuses to consider.

233
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,760
The Earth's balance can't handle
the existence of two Beth Kanes.

234
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,760
In order for one of us to live...

235
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,080
The other has to die.

236
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
You are...

237
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,680
Not me.

238
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,280
A cataclysmic collapse
of another universe?

239
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,120
An infinite number, actually,
probably having existed

240
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,160
in parallel past, present
and future timelines.

241
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,200
"Alice thought
the whole thing very absurd,

242
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,920
but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh."

243
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,360
How did you get in here, Alice?

244
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,520
The front desk guy, Kyle...

245
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Kent?

246
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,280
- Karl?
- Karl, yes.

247
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,640
You'll find him in
the janitor's closet.

248
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,880
Well, we need a new plan,
Sophie is not messing around...

249
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,600
You weren't going to tell me, Kate?

250
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,560
We have a sister.

251
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,680
You haven't exactly
made yourself available.

252
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,520
Here I am.

253
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
And...

254
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,200
Here you are.

255
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Smart.

256
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Friendly.

257
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,560
Adorable.

258
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Leave her alone.

259
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,240
No. It's... it's okay.

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,400
I understand why she resents me.

261
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,960
Oh, goody. Let's add
"blindly empathetic" to the list.

262
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,520
I'm just saying...

263
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,440
I wasn't held captive
for half my life.

264
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,040
I'm confused.

265
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,600
Surely, someone found you
washed up on the riverbank

266
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,760
after mommy's car crashed
into the river.

267
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,600
No one found me.

268
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,480
Because I never washed up
onto the riverbank.

269
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,360
Then how did you survive
the infamous crash?

270
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,760
Do tell.

271
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,000
I doubt you simply swam
to shore like a nimble little frog,

272
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,960
paddling past mother's head
as it bobbed in the rapids.

273
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,360
Beth didn't go over.

274
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,400
But there was a crash.

275
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,800
Was there not?

276
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,760
Oh, I see.

277
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,920
So on your Earth...

278
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,640
Rather than simply standing by
and sobbing...

279
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,560
your Kate pulled you
from the car before it fell.

280
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,800
I've always wondered

281
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,040
what my life would have been like
if you had saved me.

282
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,520
I just never imagined
that I'd be so...

283
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Basic.

284
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,920
Eyes that never had
to witness the horrors that I saw.

285
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,400
Ears that never had
to hear the evils I heard.

286
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,480
Lips that never had
to beg for her life.

287
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,400
Two Beth Kanes
can't exist at the same time.

288
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,680
Technically speaking,

289
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,840
we are an anomaly
of intergalactic proportions.

290
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Got it.

291
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,440
So in order for one of us to live...

292
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,920
The other has to die.

293
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,880
Now, I am no astrophysicist.

294
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,880
But I'm pretty sure
that two minus the one

295
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,200
who doesn't belong
means I get to live.

296
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,800
And my knife is pretty good at
subtraction.

297
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,640
How did you do that?

298
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,320
- Alice, stop!
- Kate, Beth needs you.

299
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,760
We're running out of time.

300
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,920
You got a trial date yet?

301
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,120
They're a little slow around here.

302
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,400
I thought you and I could use
a little alone time to talk.

303
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,640
I didn't think you did anything
without Alice's permission.

304
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,120
The only thing more dangerous
than a corrupt man...

305
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,880
Is one who thinks he's noble.

306
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,200
Not sure I need a morality lesson
from the guy

307
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,560
who sided with one of Gotham's
most prolific killers.

308
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,880
Alice had a psychotic break
to survive.

309
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,880
She never claimed to be good.

310
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
You did.

311
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,240
But your men tampered
with evidence.

312
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,680
Bribed and beat the people

313
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,720
who were too poor
to afford the Crows' services.

314
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,040
Your men killed good people.

315
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,240
So now I'm gonna kill you.

316
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Thank you.

317
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
You're better to me alive, puppy dog.

318
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,080
According to my sources,
you're on your way out of here.

319
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,840
And now that I got a target on my
back for saving a glorified cop,

320
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,360
it's only a matter of time
before I need you

321
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,560
to return the favor.

322
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,280
Cell abnormalities...

323
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Common birth defects...

324
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,000
Where are you, cosmic catastrophes?

325
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,400
Oh, look, another sister.

326
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,880
Do no harm, remember?

327
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Help me.

328
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,800
- No?
- You...

329
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,400
are not allowed to discriminate.

330
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,000
Do something.

331
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,040
Freak show cosmic anomalies
are way above my pay grade.

332
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,360
Lest we forget...

333
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,160
I saved your life.

334
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,800
Oh, lest we forget, you had your

335
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,680
creepy, little door mouse
dress up as my dad

336
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,560
- and poison me and my mom.
- But you lived.

337
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,720
Healed from the...

338
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,440
Poison instantly.

339
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,320
Because I gave you
the only antidote on the planet.

340
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,280
The serum from
the Coryana Desert Rose.

341
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
People underestimate you, Mary.

342
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Turns out...

343
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,760
you are very, very useful.

344
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
No!

345
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,360
<i>Paging Dr. Stateman
to the mental ward, please.</i>

346
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,160
<i>Dr. Stateman, please.</i>

347
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,920
Jonathan Cartwright.

348
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,440
My name is Dr. Ethan Campbell

349
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,760
and I am a plastic surgeon
here in Gotham.

350
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,640
I understand that you've pulled off
quite the scientific feat.

351
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,440
Consider me... intrigued.

352
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,840
I'm not speaking to anyone.

353
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,880
Look at you, all grown up.

354
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,840
Out in the world,
with friends who love you.

355
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,120
From my research, it seems
that you even got yourself a job

356
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,880
at Dusty's Roadside Tavern.

357
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,800
You see, purpose in life
is a hard thing to come by.

358
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,080
I would know.
I spent a decade reestablishing mine.

359
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,040
- Am I supposed to know you?
- That's precisely the point, Johnny.

360
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
You aren't.

361
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
No.

362
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,880
My purpose?

363
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
Shielding my son from ridicule.

364
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,280
Carving out a pocket
in a world of anguish

365
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,520
so that he could feel love
and joy.

366
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,480
That purpose...

367
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,080
was undone when...

368
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,640
my own boy...

369
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,960
betrayed me.

370
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Dad?

371
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,680
Hello, son.

372
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,600
It is a father's greatest joy to see
his son follow in his footsteps.

373
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,400
You could have made me so proud.

374
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,120
- I thought you were dead.
- As I intended.

375
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,480
Meanwhile, I took on
the life I deserved.

376
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,760
Recognition, praise, prestige.

377
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
But...

378
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,000
At the cost of losing you.

379
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,600
Because of her.

380
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,360
- Tell me where Alice is.
- Why?

381
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,040
So, you can kill her? That...

382
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,840
Tell me where she is, Johnny,
so I can forgive you.

383
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,240
Forgive me?

384
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
For what?

385
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,680
For standing up to my abuser?

386
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,120
For being a weak little boy.

387
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,600
Too powerless to realize
a broken girl

388
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,760
with a distorted imagination
was taking advantage of you.

389
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,320
- You... you gave her to me.
- As a playmate.

390
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
And you...

391
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,120
Let her convince you
that she was family.

392
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,640
She was my family.

393
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,800
She accepted me.

394
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,200
All of me.

395
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,040
The scars, the burns, the face...

396
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,400
you raised me to believe was
too repulsive for the world to see.

397
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,040
You looked at me
and you saw a monster.

398
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,840
She saw the window to the world.

399
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,080
I will never...

400
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,920
ever betray her.

401
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,000
- Tell me where she is, son.
- What are you doing?

402
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,320
Making it so you no longer have a
choice.

403
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,400
No, no, no.

404
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,760
Let me have it!

405
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Mary!

406
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,920
My brilliant, beautiful stepsister.

407
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
I beg you.

408
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,920
As a family.

409
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,080
That blood is the only thing
that will keep me alive.

410
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
I know.

411
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,960
And I can't think
of anyone who deserves it less.

412
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,840
<i>Crows Security.</i>

413
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,840
I understand you're looking

414
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,040
for the leader of
the Wonderland Gang.

415
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,960
I believe I know
where that little wench is hiding.

416
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Good news, Mary called.
Said she found something out.

417
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
- She's on her way.
- I like her.

418
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,800
Promise me you'll protect her, okay?

419
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,000
We are not having
those conversations, okay?

420
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,760
You're gonna make it through this.
You just have hold on.

421
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,080
Distract me, then.

422
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,320
What's a Good Luke's deal?

423
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Why?

424
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,120
Okay, the hallucinations
have definitely started.

425
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
What about you?

426
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,920
Why are you still single?

427
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,120
You sure this is how you wanna spend
your last 45 minutes?

428
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
You and I...

429
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,320
We never did
the "twin jealously" thing.

430
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,720
We're always looking out
for each other.

431
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,640
Checking in.

432
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,160
Getting advice.

433
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,520
But there was one thing that you had
that I always wanted.

434
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
- A soulmate.
- Really?

435
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,240
Anyone I know?

436
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,280
<i>Alice, we know you're inside.</i>

437
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,240
<i>Surrender immediately.
We have the building surrounded.</i>

438
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,120
I'm at the west entrance
of Wayne Tower. Position for entry.

439
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,560
What the hell is going on?

440
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,040
Alice called the Crows
hoping they would kill you.

441
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,960
Even on her deathbed,
she's ruthlessly brilliant.

442
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,640
We have a major breach.

443
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,000
They're in the lobby,
ascending the east and west stairs.

444
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,920
- Lock the elevators.
- They're gonna be here any second.

445
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Kate?

446
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
Kate!

447
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,520
- Batcave, now.
- Okay.

448
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,000
Wait. What?

449
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,320
If the Crows find you,
they will kill you.

450
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,120
Yeah, I know...I got that.
Where are we going?

451
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
Catherine?

452
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,640
Catherine?

453
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
I see.

454
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,920
I'm being haunted on my deathbed
by my past sins.

455
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,680
I'm so scared.

456
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,640
The universe must
think fondly of Kate

457
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,240
to give her everything she wants...

458
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
the version of you that she lost.

459
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,240
You don't know my sister.

460
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,840
No. I beg to differ.

461
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,080
I've known her almost
as long as you've known her.

462
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,320
Because you're a snake...

463
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,480
Who slithered her way into my family.

464
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,880
I was accepted...

465
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,800
By your father, by your sister.

466
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,160
And despite all of the mistakes
that I made, I showed remorse.

467
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,920
You don't have any remorse, Alice.
You're evil through and through.

468
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,440
And that's why Kate
will never choose you.

469
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,520
Here's what's gonna happen.

470
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,320
Mary is gonna take
that syringe to Kate...

471
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,880
And tell her that it
will only save one of us.

472
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
And Kate...

473
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,440
Kate's gonna pick me.

474
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,440
For your sake, I hope that's true.

475
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,240
But just in case
she chooses otherwise...

476
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,720
I'll save you a seat in hell.

477
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,880
Well, I finally found something
on this Earth to be jealous of.

478
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,560
Why risk your life every night
for a city of strangers?

479
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,920
Well, I think not saving Beth

480
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,480
that day on the bridge
ignited something in me.

481
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,240
You couldn't save your
own mom and sister, so...

482
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,800
Now, you save every mom and sister.

483
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,360
Guilt can make sane people
do crazy things.

484
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,760
This isn't guilt.

485
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,720
This is courage.

486
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,240
Okay. You need to sit.

487
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,480
So the Crows are searching this
place, top to bottom.

488
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,960
I counted 50 or so on foot.

489
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,000
They have ten trucks outside,
a chopper in the air.

490
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,800
We really gonna have
to wait them out.

491
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,400
We don't exactly have time
to wait.

492
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
Mary, where have you been?

493
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,080
Okay. I'll be right out.

494
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,920
What the hell happened?

495
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,680
Alice called the Crows
and send them into the building.

496
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,240
Oh, my God. Did they find Beth?

497
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,080
She's fine.
I have a panic room. remember?

498
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,320
Okay. That's right. It's genius.

499
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,440
- Okay. So how do we save them.
- What?

500
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,040
You said you found a way
to save them, what is it?

501
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,120
No, no, no. I said I found a solution
to save one. Beth.

502
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
My blood.

503
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,400
When Alice poisoned me,
she gave me an antidote.

504
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,320
The serum from
the Coryana Desert Rose.

505
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,520
She claimed it was
a universal cure-all

506
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,960
and it worked like a charm.

507
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,760
So we give it to them both.

508
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,240
Then it will cancel out

509
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,880
and we'll end up right
where we started.

510
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,720
One has to have
the edge over the other,

511
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,720
even if it's just a few seconds.

512
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,920
My blood will regenerate enough
of Beth's red blood cells

513
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,640
for her to live a little bit longer.

514
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,720
And Alice dies?

515
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,000
And I walk away
from her all over again?

516
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,120
You are not actually
considering saving Alice...

517
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
are you?

518
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,720
Kate. This is a no-brainer.

519
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,520
And not to rush you, but you've
got less than 20 minutes

520
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,880
before they're both dead.

521
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,520
So go in there and save one of
the most compassionate,

522
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,120
smartest humans that I've ever met.

523
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,760
Or go back into that clinic
and save Alice, who killed my mom.

524
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,720
The choice is yours.

525
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Kate.

526
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,720
- That's not really you.
- It's me.

527
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,800
Tell me you found Mary.

528
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,160
- Yeah.
- And did she...

529
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
The syringe?

530
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,320
I know her blood is the key
to saving you.

531
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,680
I knew you'd come back.

532
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,640
I knew you'd choose me.

533
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

534
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,440
Can we have a minute?

535
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
- Sure.
- Thanks.

536
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,880
You're not gonna tell me
who my soulmate was, are you?

537
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,600
And ruin all the fun?

538
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,400
Luke told me about the blood.

539
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,200
I'm sorry you're in this position.

540
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,760
More sorry you are.

541
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,880
Look, before you make your
decision...

542
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,040
Can I just say, after spending time
with... with Alice...

543
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,160
face-to-face, her rage, her pain.

544
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,200
Somehow, I understand her.

545
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,760
If the circumstances
had turned out differently...

546
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,680
They didn't. I didn't act.

547
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,360
I didn't save her.

548
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,560
I did nothing.

549
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,960
And I'm not about
to do nothing again.

550
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,160
You have to hurry.

551
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,560
- Alice.
- Oh, Kate.

552
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,240
There's... There's no time.

553
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Do it.

554
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,760
I came to say goodbye.

555
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
What?

556
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,440
Goodbye, Alice.

557
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
No.

558
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,400
Are you sure this is
what you wanna do?

559
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,640
Just you asking that is proof
that I made the right choice.

560
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,440
You've always been my hero.

561
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,920
You have to get her out of here.

562
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,240
They're tearing through
this place book by book

563
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,040
and it's only a matter of time
before they find the elevator.

564
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,920
Yeah. But there's still the small
problem of the checkpoints.

565
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,120
Right. Take my bike.

566
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
The tunnels will get you
past the parameter of the building.

567
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,640
And... and the bike will get you
through the checkpoint.

568
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,000
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Just back up.

569
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
Take your...

570
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,880
- Your who now?
- Bat bike.

571
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,000
Okay. Yeah. I'll just make sure
I heard what you said.

572
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,240
Kate.

573
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,080
I don't know how can
I ever thank you.

574
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,600
You're alive and that's all that
matters.

575
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Hey.

576
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Why?

577
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,360
Because she's pure...

578
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,960
And good?

579
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,320
You don't even know me.

580
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,600
Not the real me.

581
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,480
I know what you showed me.

582
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,240
I couldn't save you.

583
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,560
And all I can hope is
that you find peace.

584
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,440
Kate, stay with me?

585
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
I'm here.

586
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Halt. Stop!

587
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,520
<i>William Checkpoint to Moore.</i>

588
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,760
<i>- Go for Moore.
- Possible Bat sighting</i>

589
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,800
<i>blazed through William Checkpoint,
headed north.</i>

590
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,840
<i>Unknown passenger, looked female.</i>

591
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,840
<i>It could be Alice. Possible target.</i>

592
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,800
<i>- Want us to pursue?</i>
- <i>Negative. Stay put. I'm on it.</i>

593
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,440
Oh, I hope that guard
won't miss his face.

594
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,920
What the hell are you doing
to me?

595
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,400
Hush now, son.

596
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,080
I'll be back for you soon.

597
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,000
Man, the acceleration index...

598
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,000
Moore to base.

599
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,520
I need backup for an arrest
at the Twin Pines Inn.

600
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,800
No. Hey. No, no, no.

601
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,240
Hey. Oh, come on.

602
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,320
Hey. No. Come on. Wake up,
Beth. No. Beth, come on.

603
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,880
No, no, no.

604
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,640
You...

605
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,160
Let me die.

606
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,760
But I didn't.
