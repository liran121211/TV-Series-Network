1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Damn.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,200
<i>Watch where you go,
I'm an animal</i>

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,800
<i>You don't wanna dance,
don't wanna dance</i>

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,600
Sure, babe. Whatever you say.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,960
<i>Oh, oh, with the devil-oh</i>

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,320
<i>Watch where you go,
I'm an animal</i>

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,480
<i>If you dance with the devil oh, oh
I'm going for the jugular</i>

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,960
What... what the hell?
Are you insane?

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,360
I can't feel... Anything.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,160
I think you'll find that's
to your great advantage...

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,680
Babe.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,000
<i>I'm an animal</i>

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,920
<i>An animal</i>

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,080
<i>An animal</i>

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,120
<i>An animal</i>

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
<i>An animal</i>

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,560
<i>Watch where you go,
I'm an animal...</i>

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,960
It wasn't supposed to be Beth.

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,520
We did everything right.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,480
{\an5}We found a loophole.
We kept her alive.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,880
{\an5}We got her through the checkpoints.

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,760
I thought we were in the clear
and then, it just...

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,880
{\an5}It just came out of nowhere.

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,440
It wasn't your fault, Luke.

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,320
Look, we need to figure out
who shot her.

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
I agree.

27
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,520
First, we need to prepare ourselves
for the real Alice.

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,520
{\an5}The Crows think
that she's dead and she's not

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
which means no one's
out looking for her.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
{\an5}And if my twin picked

31
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,880
{\an5}my alien doppelganger's
life over mine,

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,840
{\an5}I'd be on the verge of going nuclear.

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,600
No offense.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
You're right.

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,640
{\an5}I looked her in the eye and told her
I chose to save someone else.

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Kate.

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
{\an5}You did the right thing.
You have to know that.

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
{\an5}It doesn't matter
because the wrong Beth lived.

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
{\an5}Now, Alice is back on
the loose because of me.

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,000
{\an5}We need to brace ourselves
for the consequences.

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,240
{\an5}Mr. Kane, Mr. Kane,
how does it feel to be exonerated?

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,920
{\an5}Any day that justice prevails
is a good day in my book.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
{\an5}You've proven you were framed
by Alice and her gang.

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,400
{\an5}What are your next steps?

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,960
{\an5}Return to the Crows
and restore peace to this city.

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,120
Look, Alice is dead.
Gotham is safer because of it.

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,600
At the end of the day,
it's all that really matters.

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
What do you plan on doing?

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
Gotham knows her as Alice.

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,680
But here at county morgue,
she's simply Jane Doe 7-1-1-3.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,960
No name, no medical history.

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
No next of kin.

53
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,920
Could we have a moment, please?

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,280
My own daughter, one of Gotham's
most diabolical killers

55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,760
dead on a metal slab.

56
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,880
After everything, it seems there
should be so many emotions but...

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,760
all I feel is hollow.

58
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,520
It was destined to end this way, sir.

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,120
The bullet wasn't one of ours.

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,120
{\an5}You radioed in and said you
had her in your sights.

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,440
{\an5}What... what happened?

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,920
Call off the shoot-to-kill
order on Alice.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,080
- You're kidding?
- Let me find her.

64
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,720
Tell the Crows to stand down.

65
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,560
{\an5}I didn't have a lock.
The target kept moving.

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,640
Well, someone got her anyway.

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,920
{\an5}Side effect of making an entire city
your enemy.

68
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,560
Tick tock.

69
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,360
Tick tock.

70
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,920
{\an5}Oh, silly Mouse.

71
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,640
{\an5}What is the purpose of a rendezvous
spot if only one party obliges?

72
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Yes?

73
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,920
This is all that was left
in his hospital room.

74
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,080
What do you mean "left"?

75
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,200
Where'd you get this?

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I took it off Beth.

77
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
After...

78
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Thank you.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,640
So, I ran the mystery shooter's
partial plate.

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
And?

81
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,120
The three numbers I remembered

82
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,840
don't match
a single registered Sedan.

83
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,720
I think the plate was stolen.

84
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,840
{\an5}Not only did we let
an innocent girl die

85
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,680
{\an5}but I can't even bring her
killer to justice.

86
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,160
{\an5}Mary's making reward flyers

87
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,000
{\an5}for any info on that vehicle.
We'll find something.

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,720
In the meantime, though,
we still live in Gotham

89
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,880
where there's plenty
of justice to dole out.

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,760
Maybe this will take
your mind off things.

91
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,720
- A vampire?
- A wannabe vampire.

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,680
{\an5}- You're not serious?
- That's kind of my point.

93
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,800
{\an5}Lately, things have been
a little... too serious.

94
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,440
You could use a distraction.

95
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,800
{\an5}Then bring me
an old-fashioned bomber

96
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,520
{\an5}or an arsonist, or someone
that exists in the real world.

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,560
- Apparently she does. Nocturna is...
- "Nocturna"?

98
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,120
Is Night-Bite taken?

99
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,480
She seduces her victims, drains their
blood and leaves them for dead.

100
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,040
It's all very early 2000s.

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,840
Both victims were lured out of clubs
on the strip in Old Gotham.

102
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Crows are replacing every doorman

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,440
so I thought, we should patrol
the only other bar

104
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,000
in the neighborhood on that street.

105
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,280
It's a place called The Catch.

106
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
That's a janky old fisherman's bar.

107
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,480
It's not really her demo,
but what about Curse?

108
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,560
EDM? It's invite only?

109
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,520
Oh! Oh, Curse.

110
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,360
The... Yeah, yeah, right.
Okay, yeah, I thought...

111
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I thought you said, "Purse".

112
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
Which is why I was like,
"A club called 'Purse'?

113
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,760
- That'd be weird."
- You have no idea what I'm talking

114
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
- Not a one, no.
- Cool.

115
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,000
So, does this mean you're suiting up?

116
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,840
I've always wanted to slay a vampire.

117
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,400
Got something.

118
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,760
One Vic, female, bound, unconscious.

119
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,960
No sign of Nocturna.

120
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,080
Scratch that. Found her.
And I found you.

121
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,280
Vampire, bat.

122
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,120
It screams duo to me.

123
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,480
- I work alone.
<i>- I heard that.</i>

124
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,560
Flattered, but you're not my type.

125
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,520
But you're mine.
I'm a universal recipient.

126
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,080
Seeing double? Losing sensation
in your limbs? Don't fight it.

127
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
What did you do?

128
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,440
I've always wondered
what bat blood tasted like.

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,320
Too bad, Batsy.

130
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,160
I do hope we get to do
this another night.

131
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,560
Okay, I'm reading your stats.
She injected you with a paralytic.

132
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,720
- I got that.
- And you have six Crows incoming.

133
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,120
I got that, too.

134
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm gonna hit you
with an adrenaline shot.

135
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,160
It takes about 30 seconds
to kick in.

136
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,480
I don't got that.

137
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,360
Modulator, now.

138
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
<i>Copy.</i>

139
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,760
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

140
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,000
Save her. She's unconscious
but she's still alive.

141
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,360
We've got medics coming.
We need to hurry.

142
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Thank you.

143
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,520
I thought you said
we needed to hurry?

144
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,800
You're gonna get my ass fired, so...

145
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
So?

146
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,440
So... next time,
I'll have to bring you in.

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,480
Which means there can't
be a next time.

148
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
Understood.

149
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,680
<i>- Could've been anywhere.
- Got it with you?</i>

150
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,960
No, I don't.

151
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,040
It's clear. I've got the victim.
Check the roof.

152
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,600
You heard her. Move out.

153
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm more than happy to run your blood

154
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,280
but you don't seem
like you have the flu.

155
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,440
I've been, pulling all-nighters
doing real estate courses.

156
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,240
And that's like germs galore.

157
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,480
- You know you can tell me anything.
- Right. Yeah.

158
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,400
So, maybe these
perceived flu-like symptoms

159
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,880
are a manifestation
of the guilt you feel?

160
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,160
For choosing Beth over Alice?

161
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,920
And even though Alice
miraculously survived,

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,760
you drew a line in the sand
you can't erase,

163
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,280
forever altering the dynamic
between you and your twin.

164
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,240
- You got all that from a blood draw?
- Kate, I'm serious.

165
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Look...

166
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,440
Beth deserved to live.

167
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,880
Do not think that there
is not one single minute

168
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,760
that goes by that
I'm not remembering her.

169
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,920
Her warmth, her spirit.

170
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Her laugh.

171
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
Okay, that's weird.

172
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,280
- You have Special K in your blood.
- Ketamine?

173
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,920
You want to tell me how
that happened?

174
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,320
I was partying pretty

175
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
- hard last night.
- Partying?

176
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,280
Someone must have slipped me
something.

177
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,560
I thought you said you were taking
real estate classes?

178
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,160
I was. No one wants to learn
about zoning laws sober.

179
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,840
- Thank you.
- Kate.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,880
Temporary paralysis was a result
of Nocturna injecting you

181
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
with an animal tranquilizer.

182
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,360
That's gotta be her M.O.

183
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,960
It wasn't really an injection.

184
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,400
It was more like a bite,
nibble, lip thing.

185
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
- TMI.
- I'm just saying

186
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
she had actual fangs
that delivered the ketamine.

187
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,240
Like when she bit down on my lip.

188
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,480
Understood and moving on.
Since the encounter was so intimate,

189
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,480
we may be able to get something off
the suit's UV detection system.

190
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,960
Behold, 600 watts of 95 percent UVA
and five percent UVB.

191
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,320
It works great for fingerprints...

192
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,560
counterfeit money,
checking out motel bed spreads.

193
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,960
Yet somehow, Nocturna didn't leave
a single trace.

194
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,920
Well, if we can't track her down,
maybe we can draw her out.

195
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,840
Please don't say blood drive.

196
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,680
We know she's targeting club-goers.

197
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,240
Maybe your little black light
will come in handy after all.

198
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,640
- We're having a party?
- We're having a party.

199
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,000
Alice may be gone...

200
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,440
So is the city's trust.

201
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,840
We are hemorrhaging clients not
because we're weak

202
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
or ineffectual, or indecisive.

203
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,320
It's because, for the first time
in four years, we have competition.

204
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,240
The city likes Batwoman

205
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,560
because she doesn't subscribe
to the rules.

206
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,680
It makes her entertaining.

207
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,720
She gets to dress up,
cause whatever mayhem she chooses

208
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,160
and zip-line away
to cheers and adoration.

209
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,040
That is not how protecting
a city works.

210
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,440
And now, there is a new predator
on the streets.

211
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,560
Nocturna.

212
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,960
Let's find this blood-guzzling serial
killer before Batwoman does.

213
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,440
Let's remind everyone

214
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,840
what real authority
actually looks like.

215
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,840
Like you never left.

216
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,080
Know anything about this?

217
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,480
Mary's Instagram page?
As little as necessary. Why?

218
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,480
She's posting about a grand opening
tonight at Kate's bar.

219
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,160
I thought it was still
several weeks off.

220
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,680
Probably not the best night
for an opening...

221
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,200
considering Nocturna's
targeting club-goers.

222
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,680
You want me to go
and keep an eye on things.

223
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,640
<i>You better get it</i>

224
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
<i>Better get it girl</i>

225
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,120
<i>You better get it girl</i>

226
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,280
<i>Better get it girl</i>

227
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,840
<i>You better get it</i>

228
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,760
Mary's here.

229
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,480
Did we just lure a vampire

230
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,040
to us using a bar full
of walking blood bags?

231
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,440
Theoretically, yes.

232
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,840
Technically, no.

233
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,080
Think of our high-res facial
recognition cameras

234
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,560
as a sort of digital garlic.

235
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,800
If Nocturna shows, we'll get her.

236
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,160
Though so far,
the most suspicious woman here

237
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,640
has three outstanding
parking tickets.

238
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
What?

239
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,800
Is that Sophie?

240
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,160
<i>Better get it girl</i>

241
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,960
<i>You better get it girl</i>

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,280
Someone write my obituary
because I am dead.

243
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,960
Thanks, but I'm just blending in.
I'm here for work.

244
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,480
Well, you are definitely working
something.

245
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,400
Come with me.

246
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,920
So, that's the Sophie?

247
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Yes.

248
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,440
She broke up with you, right?

249
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Because...

250
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,920
I'll be in the field.

251
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,240
Sparkling water.

252
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
With a little vodka.

253
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,240
Mary, I'm working.

254
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,880
Oh, I know. So does everyone
else in here. You need to chill.

255
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,680
I need to find Nocturna.

256
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,240
She drugged Batwoman last night,
nearly killed her.

257
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,640
I didn't hear that.

258
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,080
- No one did.
- Except you.

259
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm getting a strong whiff
of Earl Grey. Spill.

260
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,480
I may have freed her
before my guys could bring her in.

261
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,000
- Really?
- Tell your dad and I'll kill you.

262
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,480
This is way too enjoyable
for me to squander.

263
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,760
Tequila, please.

264
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,200
- Sophie, come on.
- What?

265
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
What?

266
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
No.

267
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,360
Sorry, did I just totally cut in

268
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,360
between you guys
like the rudest person ever?

269
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,000
No, you're fine. We were just...

270
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,560
Hi, Elle.

271
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
Sophie.

272
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,240
Guess who almost wore
that exact dress tonight?

273
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,600
I'm glad I didn't.
I would've felt incredibly less than.

274
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,040
Oh, I'm sure you would've looked...

275
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
Great.

276
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,440
Oh, my God. Fantasia, hi!

277
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,080
- Mary.
- BRB.

278
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,160
So, Sophie, what do you do?

279
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
<i>Base to Kate, we've got a
legit lead here.</i>

280
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,000
Elle Scatlin, 28, dark hair,
arrest record

281
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,320
<i>and works in veterinary medicine.</i>

282
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,760
Which means she has access
to ketamine. Which one is she?

283
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,520
Well, she's... The one
all over Sophie right now.

284
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Sir. I was just coming to find you.
We were able to grab

285
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,680
the surveillance footage from
inside the warehouse.

286
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,120
- Do you know who Nocturna is?
- Unfortunately, no.

287
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,480
I have a dozen other things
I need to be dealing with.

288
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,320
Sir, I'm the only one who knows
about what's on here.

289
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,120
If you choose to do nothing,
it can completely vanish.

290
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,760
But I do think you need to see it.

291
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,120
<i>If you don't wanna see me</i>

292
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,880
<i>Did a full 180, crazy</i>

293
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,680
<i>Thinking about the way I was</i>

294
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,160
Sophie's just working her.

295
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
Just trying to figure out
if it's Nocturna.

296
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,560
Convincingly so.

297
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,480
No one is that funny.

298
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,960
She seems to be a little funny.

299
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,880
So, we can either sit here
and make a reaction video,

300
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,680
or you could go out and figure out
who Elle Scatlin is yourself.

301
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,280
I'll look like a jealous ex.

302
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,240
Or a hero who catches
a serial killer.

303
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,520
You go if you're so eager.

304
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,080
You're Batwoman.
I'm wearing the glow-in-the-dark tie.

305
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,960
Is Sophie doing
the nervous napkin fold?

306
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,040
Oh, smiling, blushing, folding.

307
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,240
You are never leaving
the Batcave again. Okay?

308
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,680
Okay.

309
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,920
Crow Security.
And here you seem so promising.

310
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,760
I take it you're not one of our
clients.

311
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,240
My family used the Crows
when I was a kid.

312
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,960
I used to love having Eddie
walk me to school

313
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,360
and having the guys
protect the house.

314
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,240
So, what changed?

315
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,560
I grew up.

316
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,840
I realized they were more
of a status symbol

317
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,960
than actual protection.

318
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,720
And if I'm going to root for someone

319
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,400
who skirts the law
and lacks accountability,

320
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,800
it's gonna be Batwoman.

321
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,960
And the head-to-toe black leather
certainly doesn't hurt.

322
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,680
It's not leather, actually.

323
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,400
It's bullet-proof nanotech.

324
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,040
Supposedly, nothing
like it on the planet.

325
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,200
Intimate details.
You two ever thrown down?

326
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
On the house.

327
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,760
Kate, hey.

328
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,840
Thanks for the drink. I'm Elle.

329
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,080
Kate. Hi.

330
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,840
Oh, dear.

331
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,440
Mary Hamilton, right?
Andi Ostergaard.

332
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,360
- I follow you online.
- Oh, okay, right.

333
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,280
So, how do you two know each other?

334
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
We don't. We just met.

335
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,120
And we're already
having our first fight.

336
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,320
- Batwoman. Pro or con?
- Batwoman?

337
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, that is definitely
gonna leave a mark.

338
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,400
Oh, my God.

339
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,480
Sorry. Blood makes me...

340
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,600
Can I get some water?

341
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm sorry.
I'm a light-headed blood wimp.

342
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,120
- Everything okay, Kate?
- I think so.

343
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,600
Duty calls.
Be careful with that knife.

344
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,720
I will.

345
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,840
<i>I drive an i8, the new one.</i>

346
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,040
<i>Never really saw myself as a Beemer
chick, but it's pretty sweet.</i>

347
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,000
So, you here with anyone or?

348
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,400
- What?
- Mary.

349
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,680
Hey, I was waiting for you outside.

350
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,080
My bad. I thought
that you said by the bar.

351
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,760
Sorry, are you guys?

352
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,520
- Oh, my boyfriend's brother.
- Together.

353
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,760
Okay.

354
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,360
I'll let you two sort that out.

355
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,080
See you on socials, Mary.

356
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,800
- Don't drink and drive.
- Yeah. Okay.

357
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,600
Kind of went a long way
to make clear I'm not your boyfriend.

358
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,800
- Does your tie glow in the dark?
- Yes, it does.

359
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,120
I actually love that.

360
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,240
It's not her.

361
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,040
You positive
or you just got uncomfortable?

362
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,840
- Who are you talking to?
- Kate.

363
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,400
- <i>What?</i>
- No. Not you, Kate.

364
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
- I'm talking to Mary.
- Why are you talking to Kate?

365
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,760
I thought you were her real estate
assistant.

366
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,200
Associate.

367
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,800
With a hidden ear piece
to direct-line into his boss

368
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,760
at a club on a Saturday night?

369
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,680
Kate's needy.

370
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,960
<i>I need you now.</i>

371
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,320
I have to go.

372
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,840
He's so strange.

373
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,120
I'll call the GCPD.

374
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
I got it.

375
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,840
Kate, we have a club full
of innocent people.

376
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I said I got it.

377
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Where is he?

378
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,120
- Where is who?
- Mouse. Where are you keeping him?

379
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,640
No idea.

380
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,360
Then this was a waste of my time.

381
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,240
We should talk about what happened.

382
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Talk?

383
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
Why?

384
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,280
Do you think letting me die
on a linoleum floor

385
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,640
got lost in subtext?

386
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,760
I get it, Kate.

387
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,480
I mean nothing to you.

388
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,040
The Crows think you're dead.
You got a second chance, Alice.

389
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,760
You had a second chance
to save me and you didn't take it.

390
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,920
Instead, you chose
a complete stranger.

391
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,360
Beth wasn't a stranger.
Don't you get it? She was you.

392
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,720
The kind, compassionate,
good version of you.

393
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,800
The version of you
I thought you could be.

394
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,200
The version who couldn't survive...

395
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,520
despite everything you did
to keep her alive.

396
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
That's rich.

397
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,360
I guess this is the new normal now.

398
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,840
I hope she was worth it.

399
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,480
What did you tell me
from the beginning?

400
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,320
"Don't let her in your head, Alice.
She is changing you, Alice."

401
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,160
And what did I do?

402
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,520
Answer me, Mouse!

403
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,480
What did I do...

404
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,560
exactly...

405
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,720
my sweet, innocent, Mouse?

406
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,280
I ignored you.

407
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,240
I said I was in control.
I was stronger.

408
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,240
I would win her back.

409
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,080
But I was wrong.

410
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,280
And my sister let me die.

411
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You're right.

412
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,760
I mustn't let her get in my head.
I can't.

413
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,680
Why should I care
what she thinks of me?

414
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,680
Why should I care if
she doesn't love me?

415
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,040
What about Willow Martin?

416
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,080
She fits the physical description
and she has a record.

417
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,880
No. She was livestreaming
a concert last night.

418
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,520
Rhonda Schifino is a possibility.
Goth, arrived solo.

419
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,680
Found her puking tequila shots
in the bathroom.

420
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,080
She's going through a breakup.

421
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,560
I'll add her to the "no" pile.

422
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,520
We gonna talk about this?

423
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,680
I know you called the police.

424
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,520
That's what people tend to do
when a serial murderer shows up.

425
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,360
We're currently in the process of
inviting a serial murderer in here.

426
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,240
- Now,...
- Nocturna's different, okay? She...

427
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,560
What? You can say it.

428
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,000
She can't get to you
the way Alice does.

429
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,280
Look, whatever hope I had
for Alice is gone.

430
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,600
No guilt- trip that she can put on me
will change that.

431
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,560
Wait, who is that?

432
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,880
Natalia Night, 27.

433
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,640
Adopted by a Charles Night...

434
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,880
who's a janitor at
the Gotham Cathedral Church.

435
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,120
He died of a heart
attack two weeks ago.

436
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,160
Right before the killing started.

437
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,360
Natalia was born
with a unique type of porphyria.

438
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,920
Okay, she can't be exposed
to sunlight

439
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,520
and her kidneys have trouble
cleaning her blood.

440
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,360
That's why she needs fresh blood.

441
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,880
And if Dad was a caretaker
and he died...

442
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,080
Then Natalia was left
to her own devices.

443
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,240
Got an address?

444
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,880
No, but I have Wayne's cameras.

445
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,160
Try to find out where they're going.

446
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,280
Look, you wanna top yourself off,
be my guest.

447
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,320
But pretty soon my...

448
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,760
"Check engine" light's gonna go off.

449
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,640
That's how this works.

450
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
You've seen my face.

451
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,880
And you've seen mine.

452
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,080
I don't want anyone
to know I'm alive.

453
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,680
And you don't want anyone
to know what you look like.

454
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,400
So get your fill, let me go and...

455
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,600
No one has to be the wiser.

456
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,160
My fill, Alice, is every last drop.

457
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,080
So try to relax.

458
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,160
Adrenaline adds a nasty aftertaste.

459
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,640
- You're making a big mistake.
- Heard all the lines, sweetie.

460
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,480
No. Seriously.

461
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:14,440
See, you are running around Gotham,
drinking gas station whiskey...

462
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,480
when there is a beautiful...

463
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,080
500-dollar bottle...

464
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,960
of Beaujolais...

465
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,480
Just sitting on the shelf.

466
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,080
Okay, Alice.

467
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,600
You can color me intrigued.

468
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,560
We have Crows all over the Strip
but no leads on Nocturna yet, sir.

469
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,720
I wonder if Batwoman has one.

470
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,760
You working with her?

471
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,920
With Batwoman?
I've had a few run-ins with her...

472
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,280
Have you ever helped her
and has she helped you?

473
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,560
Sir, I assure you,
I'm a Crow through and through.

474
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,240
You are the last person
I expected to see.

475
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,200
- Where's Nocturna?
- Wish I knew.

476
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,840
Unfortunately,
I've been a little tied up.

477
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,760
Have a good night.

478
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,920
Hello?

479
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,120
Oh, girl, you are a little too drunk
for those shoes. You all right?

480
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,640
- I'm fine. I just... I need...
- Yeah.

481
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,600
Let me get your hair, at least. Yeah.

482
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,200
Thank you. You're sweet.

483
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,920
What did she inject me with?

484
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,920
Ketamine. It'll wear off soon.

485
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Lovely.

486
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,600
Rope she used on me was red.
I've seen colored ropes like this.

487
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,600
- They're bell ropes.
- Bell ropes?

488
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,280
From a church. Every bell has
a different color, like notes.

489
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Luke, does Gotham Cathedral
have bells?

490
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,800
Let me check.

491
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,960
Why did she start to fill these up
and then stop?

492
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,800
I don't know.

493
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,080
- She's fickle.
- She's meticulous.

494
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,720
She doesn't leave a victim
until they're bone-dry.

495
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,120
I'm sorry that my being alive

496
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,160
continues to disappoint you.

497
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,440
You're hiding something.

498
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,680
Why didn't she kill you?

499
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,840
I told you.

500
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,400
I have no idea.

501
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,200
You should be dead.

502
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
I know, Kate.

503
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,640
You did everything in your power
to make sure of that.

504
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,440
<i>Gotham Cathedral does have
bells.</i>

505
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,040
However, it's abandoned.
Hasn't held mass in over a year.

506
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,240
Headed there now.

507
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,280
Mary! Mary!

508
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,640
<i>Touch me rough
and I'll make you mine</i>

509
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,560
<i>You won't break me</i>

510
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,760
<i>Oh, hit me with your thunder</i>

511
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,720
She's lost too much blood.
What's her type?

512
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,880
B negative.

513
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,680
Well, looks like I drew
the short straw.

514
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,600
You're A Positive.
I'm O Negative. Universal donor.

515
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,440
I don't have a lot left.
It's been a bit of a day.

516
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,240
This should be enough
to get her heart started.

517
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,920
<i>No, I won't seek cover</i>

518
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,800
You can pull up a chair and watch
or go catch Nocturna.

519
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,960
If you so much as...

520
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,720
Kill her? Look at her.
It's me or nothing.

521
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
Go.

522
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,760
<i>No, I won't seek cover</i>

523
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,600
<i>Come in with your best shot
Oh, you know I won't stop</i>

524
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,080
<i>Till I'm 6ft under</i>

525
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Your little fantasy is over.

526
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,760
I think it's just starting.

527
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,000
For the record, killing people,
not sexy.

528
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,720
You see victims. I see kids

529
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,600
with perfect skin,
perfect kidneys, perfect lives...

530
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,840
who pollute their blood with every
toxin they can get their hands on.

531
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,200
So, they deserve to die?

532
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,600
And I do? I never even had a chance.

533
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,760
No!

534
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,200
Yes, I let her go.

535
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,160
Nocturna was on the premises
and I thought Batwoman could help...

536
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Help us?

537
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,560
Do you have any idea
what kind of position

538
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
you put me in here?

539
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Answer it.

540
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,400
- Sir, it's not important...
- I gave you an order.

541
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Agent Moore.

542
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,160
<i>Nocturna is on the roof
of Gotham Cathedral.</i>

543
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,760
- <i>Cuffed.</i>
- I have to go.

544
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,360
Sir, we could use the help.

545
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,640
Look. While you were in the jail,

546
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
we practically turned Gotham
into a police state

547
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,040
in order to find Alice.
We have no accountability.

548
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,080
- We're losing the public...
- Enough!

549
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,840
I woke up today thinking
my biggest problem

550
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,200
was the masked vigilante
running around the city.

551
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,160
It turns out my
biggest problem, Moore,

552
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,680
is that I no longer trust
my second-in-command.

553
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,520
You need to decide
who's team you're on.

554
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,720
Batwoman's or mine.

555
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,200
Now, you take some time
to think it over.

556
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
You're suspended.

557
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Get out.

558
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,720
Hey, how are you doing?

559
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,160
I think I'm on sugar high.

560
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,880
Do you remember anything
about last night?

561
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,480
I remember Nocturna drugging me

562
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,720
and then performing some
ritualistic blood sacrifice

563
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,920
and then I passed out.

564
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,960
The next thing you know, Batwoman
brought me here and gave me these.

565
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,360
- I'm really sorry, Mary.
- It's not your fault.

566
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,160
Not to mention, the idea of Batwoman

567
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,480
going into a c-store
to buy me cookies is semi priceless.

568
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,080
Do you know
why Nocturna targeted you?

569
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,920
She said the blood
from the Desert Rose

570
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,120
- could cure her condition.
- Desert Rose?

571
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,600
Yeah, that super rare cure-all
that's supposedly in my blood.

572
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,800
Though I ran several tests
on my own sample last week

573
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,760
and it didn't yield anything
extraordinary.

574
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,120
How'd she know about your blood?

575
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,400
Honestly, she can have it.

576
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,080
It's caused us all way
too many problems.

577
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,640
I will be back later. I have to go.

578
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,600
Wait, you just got here.

579
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,960
How did Nocturna
know about the Desert Rose?

580
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,840
You mean, how did you know

581
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,680
that Nocturna knew
about the Desert Rose?

582
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,200
Yes, Mary is alive
because I saved her.

583
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,480
You sent her after Mary.

584
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,400
Of course I did.
It was Mary's life or mine.

585
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,560
And someone had
to choose me for once.

586
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,840
If you want me to feel guilty,
I don't.

587
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,200
I never will, not after everything
you've done.

588
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,880
See, I don't believe you.
I think somewhere deep down,

589
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,440
there's a teeny-tiny part
of you that's relieved I lived.

590
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,400
That you hadn't quite failed at
saving me.

591
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,320
And they call Nocturna a vampire...

592
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,920
When all you do is feed off my guilt
like the parasite you are.

593
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,640
So, you're saying
that you feel guilty?

594
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,560
What's the endgame, Alice?
Why'd you save Mary?

595
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,760
To prove to you how stupid
you were for letting me die.

596
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,800
"Stupid"?

597
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,240
Stupid was thinking
that my sister was redeemable.

598
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,280
Stupid was convincing
the Crows not to kill you.

599
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,040
Stupid was rescuing you
from the Gotham River.

600
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,680
Convincing Dad
that I could get Beth back.

601
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,880
Stupid was thinking
that you could ever,

602
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,200
ever possibly be worth it.

603
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,520
But maybe I don't want you
to give up on me.

604
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,880
Mouse only had two visitors,
you and a Dr. Campbell.

605
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,240
What do we know
about this Dr. Campbell?

606
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,360
Figured you'd ask.

607
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,080
Gotham's most elite plastic surgeon,
20 years of Lippo, rhino...

608
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,200
Now, this is interesting.

609
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,560
Six years ago, he took a sabbatical.

610
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,040
When he returned, divorced his wife.

611
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,200
Started specializing
in facial reconstruction

612
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,120
of child burn victims.

613
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,320
Six years ago?

614
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,960
What a long and sad tale you have,
Dr. Campbell.

615
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,920
Or should I perhaps
call you August Cartwright?

616
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,000
What do you think?

617
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,560
Is the caterpillar trying to convince
the world that he's a butterfly?

618
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,600
If so, I will follow him to you...

619
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,760
My little Mouse.

620
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,560
And together,
we will pull off his wings.

621
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,760
<i>Put a stake in her,
she is done, Gotham.</i>

622
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,920
<i>Our local two-fanged menace
is en route to Arkham</i>

623
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,360
<i>thanks to Crow Security.</i>

624
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,560
<i>Turns out, they didn't need</i>

625
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,920
<i>a special undead division
for this bust.</i>

626
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,560
<i>Because Nocturna, aka Natalia Night,
is just your run-of-the-mill mortal</i>

627
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,240
<i>with a skin condition
and dental implants</i>

628
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,680
<i>that injected ketamine
into her victims.</i>

629
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,040
- <i>That said, she did do her...</i>
- Ketamine.

630
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,640
- You have Special K in your blood.
- Ketamine?

631
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,960
Wait.

632
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,480
I need to find Nocturna.
She drugged Batwoman last night.

633
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,080
With a hidden ear piece,
to direct line into his boss?

634
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
I have to go.

635
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,600
Kate.

636
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,520
You are totally Batwoman.

637
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,320
<i>I hate when you go</i>

638
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,320
<i>But I hate when you're here</i>

639
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,760
<i>I was fine all alone</i>

640
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,560
I thought they banned this thing.

641
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,120
They did, but I couldn't exactly
slide into your DMs.

642
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,680
So my boss found out
we've been working together.

643
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,880
- Damn.
- Yeah.

644
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Damn.

645
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,520
I have no idea
who I am without my job.

646
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,720
I know the feeling.

647
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
I mean...

648
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,200
I'm not even 30...

649
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,160
and I'm second-in-command of one

650
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,280
of the biggest security firms
in the country.

651
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,400
This is my dream job.

652
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,640
It's all I know.
It's all I've trained for. I...

653
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,600
It would be insane
to throw everything away...

654
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
I get it.

655
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,440
I'll keep my distance.

656
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Wait.

657
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,800
<i>Throwing everything off track
All your trouble</i>

658
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,440
<i>I'm in too deep</i>

659
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,800
<i>Now, I know what they mean
When they say it's serious</i>

660
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,800
<i>How could this be?</i>

661
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,360
<i>When we touch, it's a dream
Oh, you're making me delirious</i>

662
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,080
<i>This is love</i>
