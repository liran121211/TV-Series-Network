1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,320
Happy birthday!

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,560
- How did you get in here?
- Easy.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,320
Hey, did you guys fire
that hot front-desk guy?

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,200
Because he was the best part
of this place.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,440
Hi.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm back.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,320
Happy birthday.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,640
- Did Sophie let you go?
- Who?

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,120
Kate, I'm home from a semester abroad
and this is how you react?

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,520
It's bad enough that they converted
my apartment into a boy's dorm room,

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,080
and no one chose to talk to me...

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,880
- Who are you?
- What's wrong with you?

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,800
- Who are you?
- It's me. It's Beth.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,080
- Beth?
- Who the hell else would I be?

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,600
- Kate, you're hurting me.
- Not yet, but I will.

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,000
"Are there any lions
or tigers about here?"

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,040
"It's only the Red King snoring."

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,520
- Happy birthday, Beth.
- You remembered.

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,080
{\an5}I hope you like blueberry.

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,720
{\an5}And I got you a present.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,680
I found this out by the shed.

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,320
It's a kitty.

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,720
My dad can't know.

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,080
{\an5}- It has to be a secret.
- Hi, little guy.

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
What are you gonna call him?

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,720
Chessie.

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,440
{\an5}You'll be our Cheshire Cat.

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,240
Johnny tells me it's your birthday.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
Beth, you're very lucky to have
such a kind and thoughtful friend.

30
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,400
I suppose...

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
{\an5}it wouldn't be official

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
without making a wish.

33
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,440
What'd you wish for?

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,160
{\an5}To see my sister and father.

35
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
Beth.

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,680
{\an5}If you say your wish out loud,
it means it will never come true.

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
Time for your classes, Johnny.

38
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,400
<i>Beth's dead.</i>

39
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,200
Whatever happened
to her in that house erased

40
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
{\an5}all traces of my daughter.

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,360
{\an5}She's gone.
Don't make the mistake I made.

42
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,920
{\an5}It'd be a mistake
to not even try to interrogate Alice.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,640
<i>So, she can prattle off a bunch
of nonsensical nursery rhymes?</i>

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,320
Or incriminate herself.

45
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,720
{\an5}I appreciate the attempt, but you're
not getting a confession out of her.

46
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,960
{\an5}<i>- It's too big a risk.</i>
- Risk of what?

47
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,480
{\an5}<i>Letting Alice into your head.</i>

48
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,640
{\an5}Let's just keep her on ice until
she can be transferred to Arkham.

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,280
{\an5}After that, she's their problem.

50
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,280
{\an5}Were you planning on telling me
that Alice escaped?

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,040
{\an5}What are you talking about?

52
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,400
She showed up at my office just now.

53
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,800
That's impossible.

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,800
She's been in a holding cell
for the last eight hours.

55
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,240
- Is that a live feed?
- Yes. With two guards at the door.

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,840
She's downstairs.
You're welcome to see for yourself.

57
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,760
I swear I just saw her.

58
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,720
{\an5}Then you're not the only one.

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,920
{\an5}Mary saw her too.

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,400
I took prints off the messenger bag
the Alice look-alike left behind.

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,600
{\an5}They're an exact match

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,280
{\an5}for Alice's prints
in the Crows's database.

63
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,640
{\an5}Look, there's more.
I found this in her wallet.

64
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,200
It's not in the system,
but that is hands-down

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,800
the best fake ID I've ever seen.

66
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,320
{\an5}- Somebody went to a lot of trouble.
- You're telling me.

67
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,960
Apparently, she wrote
a 300-page dissertation

68
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,760
on <i>Theoretical Extragalactic
Astrophysics and Cosmology.</i>

69
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,720
Maybe there's some answers in here.

70
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,960
It's locked with a security code,

71
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,480
but I might be able
to crack it in a couple hours.

72
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Or...

73
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,280
- "Waffles."
- How did you know that?

74
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,600
Beth always used it. Only password
she could ever remember.

75
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Okay.

76
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,720
Oh, my god.
How are you and her...

77
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
I don't know.

78
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,480
You two seem really close.

79
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,400
We should tell your dad about this.

80
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,440
No. Not until we figure out
what's going on.

81
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,400
Wait, where are you going?

82
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,080
To see if anyone in Gotham
University's astrophysics department

83
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,800
has ever heard of... Beth?

84
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,080
Are we calling her Beth? Alice 2.0?

85
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,760
Well, when you figure it out,
let me know.

86
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,840
Okay, I've seen pictures
like this before.

87
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,760
Beth and me, together.

88
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,120
Only it was on a different Earth.

89
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,520
So, when that dude
put all the Earths in a blender...

90
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Somehow she landed on this one.

91
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,640
But how is she Beth and not Alice?

92
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
Like, what happened after the crash?

93
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,560
Maybe there was no crash.

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,920
Infinite Earths, infinite variables,
I'd bet. A butterfly flaps its wings.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,680
No Cartwright, no Mouse, no Alice.
She was spared all that.

96
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,920
Still, this world has gotta be
a very scary place for her.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,360
One second, she's on her Earth.

98
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,240
The next, she's slingshot
to this one, where nobody knows her.

99
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, and the only person
who does attacks her.

100
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,600
Her own twin sister. Happy birthday.

101
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,800
- I gotta find her.
- Yeah, where do you think she is?

102
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,600
Where we'd always go on our birthday.

103
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,880
Beth! Beth, I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

104
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,720
You gonna attack me again, psycho?

105
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
No. No, I...

106
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,760
It's a long story,
but I didn't recognize you then.

107
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
But I do now.

108
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,440
Well, you are the only one.

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,560
Nobody else even knows who I am.
I feel like I'm going crazy.

110
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,440
What's happening?

111
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
My wish came true.

112
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,640
I understand you have a request.

113
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,400
Oh, I have a lot of requests.

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,960
But since I highly doubt
that you'll grant me my freedom,

115
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,440
or my butterfly knife,

116
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,440
I'll settle for my book.

117
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Your book?

118
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,160
Yes. My copy of <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

119
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,280
I imagine it's around here somewhere.

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,600
Plundered by your Crows
when they raided my little hideaway.

121
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,000
It did bring me so much comfort the
last time, I was locked in a cell.

122
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,360
Unless you're willing
to admit to framing my boss

123
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
for the murder of his wife,

124
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,520
I'm not interested in your comfort.

125
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,360
Well, that is no way to treat someone
on their birthday.

126
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,520
I wouldn't hold out hope
for me throwing you a party.

127
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,200
That's okay.
One's already being planned.

128
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,080
What's that supposed to mean?

129
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,520
Well, I wouldn't wanna ruin
the surprise.

130
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,600
You see, Kate always hated surprises.

131
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
But me?

132
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
I love them.

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
<i>Hi.</i>

134
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
<i>You have something I want.</i>

135
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,080
<i>And I have something
that you'll want back.</i>

136
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,720
<i>Two things, in fact.</i>

137
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,760
<i>- Say hello to Steven.</i>
- <i>Help!</i>

138
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,760
<i>Commissioner of Forbes and Son.</i>

139
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,200
<i>And Bryan, Mayor Akins's
heir apparent.</i>

140
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,040
<i>I'll give you until 9.00pm.
to release Alice.</i>

141
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,440
<i>If you don't,</i>

142
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,480
<i>I'll snuff out Gotham's best
and brightest.</i>

143
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,000
So, literally no one knows me
on this Earth?

144
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,720
On the upside, I guess none
of my exes know me here either.

145
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,600
You're taking
this death-of-the-multiverse

146
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,520
thing better than thought.

147
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,400
I do have a master's degree
in astrophysics,

148
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,600
so the concept of multiple universes
isn't that bizarre.

149
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,800
Here's to making up lost time.

150
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,080
I have to ask, what the hell
do all your tattoos mean?

151
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,640
So, you're telling me
that the parallel Kate,

152
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,040
- did not have tattoos?
- Are you kidding?

153
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,400
Commander Kane would've disowned
you.

154
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,640
So, my dad was still the head
of the Crows on your Earth?

155
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,520
Yeah, and technically,
he was our dad.

156
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,760
- God, it's so weird.
- I know.

157
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,600
But you know what's really weird,
despite your tats

158
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,560
and the fact that this used
to be my bank...

159
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,280
is that it feels
like I'm back on my Earth.

160
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,600
And it's just a normal day
just chatting to my sister.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,200
And not to be a total creep, but...

162
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,520
you still just feel like
the best friend

163
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,760
I've had my whole life.

164
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,640
We were best friends.

165
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,520
Yeah, ever since you pulled me
from the car, I've always...

166
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,880
Wait. What car?

167
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Right...

168
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,160
When we were 13, driving back
from our bat mitzvah,

169
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,720
- our car went off a bridge.
- So, there was a crash?

170
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Yeah.

171
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,240
That's how Mom died.

172
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,520
Mom, you can't go. Mom!

173
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,280
But you...

174
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
You climbed back into the car.

175
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,240
Kate, where are you going?
Wait.

176
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,920
And you pulled me out.

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,520
- Beth, please, grab my hand.
- Get me out.

178
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,360
You saved me.

179
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
<i>Beth!</i>

180
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,200
<i>No!</i>

181
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
<i>Beth!</i>

182
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,600
And ever since then,
you've been my hero.

183
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,840
- What is it?
<i>- You near a TV?</i>

184
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,160
<i>Gotham is on high alert
in the wake of the Wonderland Gang</i>

185
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,720
<i>committing what could be
their most brazen crime to date</i>

186
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
<i>with the kidnapping of the sons
of two of Gotham's highest officials.</i>

187
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,800
<i>Despite the unfolding
hostage situation</i>

188
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,000
<i>involving Commissioner
Forbes's own son,</i>

189
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,680
<i>the GCPD has not turned
on the Bat-Signal.</i>

190
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,680
- <i>Commissioner Forbes...
- Commissioner...</i>

191
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,680
Does your refusal to turn on
the Bat-Signal have anything to do

192
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,680
with the Batwoman
coming out as a lesbian?

193
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,840
My wife and I
are incredibly concerned

194
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,040
for the safety of our son
and that of Bryan Akins.

195
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,760
Let's not get distracted
by politics. Thank you.

196
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,680
Okay. If they're not
gonna take Batwoman's help,

197
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,440
they're sure as hell gonna need ours.

198
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
Oh, so now you come bearing gifts.

199
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,720
It is your birthday.

200
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,320
I know what you're doing.

201
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,160
But the question is, do you?

202
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,600
I'm granting your request.

203
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,520
I ran it through x-ray,
thermal imaging,

204
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,440
even an ion mobility spectrometer.

205
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,920
- Turns out it's just a book.
- Oh, no.

206
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
- It's so much more than that.
- Yeah?

207
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,960
So, what makes it so special?

208
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,440
It set me free from
that house of horrors.

209
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,880
Hold still.

210
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,840
Johnny, if you don't keep still,
the adhesive won't set.

211
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,600
It's all wrong.

212
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
The seams, it's hideous.

213
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,640
You look like a quilt.

214
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,480
<i>It turns out we were both
trapped in that awful place.</i>

215
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,600
I was in that house.

216
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,040
I can't imagine what years in
that place must've been like.

217
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,880
But you do know
what it's like to feel trapped.

218
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,320
Don't you, Sophie?

219
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,040
I imagine you've felt
that way your entire life.

220
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,960
It's unbearable.

221
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,000
When the only thing
you dream about is being...

222
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Out.

223
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,760
Prep the suit. I'm coming in.

224
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,760
How are we doing on the location?

225
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm working on it
but GCPD's got nothing.

226
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,920
Not a surprise.
They don't have enough sense

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,240
to turn on the Bat-Signal.

228
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,000
Haven't you heard? I'm too political.

229
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,440
So they'd rather avoid
a political hot potato

230
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,160
than have Batwoman save the kid?
That's crazy.

231
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,120
Welcome to the world we live in.
I'm gonna save them anyway.

232
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,880
That sounds like something Bruce
would say.

233
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Yeah. Well, he'd probably
actually do it too.

234
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,400
Okay. What is it?

235
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,480
I could've saved her, Luke.

236
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,920
Everybody told me that if I went
back in that car to get Beth,

237
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,920
that I would've been killed.
Well, it's not true.

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You wanna hear the truth?

239
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,200
You got Beth back.
She doesn't need saving.

240
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,480
But right now, there's some
pretty high- profile hostages who do.

241
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,840
On my way.

242
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,840
<i>It's in the air</i>

243
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,760
<i>It's everywhere you go</i>

244
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
<i>According to Mouse's deadline,</i>

245
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
<i>you've got two hours
to find these hostages.</i>

246
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Copy.

247
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,840
<i>Time's up</i>

248
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,640
<i>Time's up</i>

249
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,280
<i>West Hollow's clear.
Cut down Sanders Avenue.</i>

250
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Thanks.

251
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,640
<i>Rise! Rise! Rise!</i>

252
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,480
<i>Rise! Rise!</i>

253
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,120
Kate? Batcave to Kate,
can you hear me?

254
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,840
Kate, say something.

255
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,040
<i>Kate? Kate? Kate!</i>

256
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,840
You guys okay?

257
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,520
Did you enjoy your nap?

258
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,000
I thought it best to intercept you

259
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,200
before you made your wardrobe change.

260
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,400
You know, you are much more docile
without your evening wear.

261
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,040
How are they treating you?

262
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,160
Well, I'm chained
to a table on my birthday, so...

263
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,560
I don't think they value the lives
of the hostages you've taken.

264
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,400
Well, I may have someone that
they might care a bit more about.

265
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Sophie.

266
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,840
- Kate?
- Hi, sis.

267
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,240
- Are you hurt? Are you okay?
- No worse than Survival Training.

268
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,400
You remember that, how we never
would've made it without each other?

269
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,560
- Yeah.
- Then I need you to listen to me.

270
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,320
Let Alice go.

271
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,280
Let Alice go. Do you understand?

272
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,400
I understand.

273
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,760
Good. Because time's running out.

274
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,200
And my next call will be to tell you
where to find Kate's body.

275
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,000
Hey, Luke.

276
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,880
Right. You don't know me.

277
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
But you know me?

278
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,920
Yeah. You work for my cousin, Bruce.

279
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,280
- You're Lucius Fox's son.
- Yeah.

280
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,000
- I'm just looking for Kate...
- She's been kidnapped.

281
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,120
Sorry. There's no easy way
for me to get that out, but yeah.

282
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,320
Kidnapped? As in taken?

283
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
By whom?

284
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,400
There's no easy way for me
to get this out either, but by you.

285
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,200
- Yeah, that's not happening.
- What?

286
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,600
Did you hear Kate
practically begging for her life?

287
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,800
In Survival Training, Kate
and I learned to fool our captors

288
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,320
by sending coded messages
in the open.

289
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,440
Repeat a message twice,
it meant, "Do the opposite."

290
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,800
She was saying, "Don't let Alice go."

291
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,720
Clever and sweet.

292
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,760
You two have your
own little language.

293
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,400
Let me tell you a secret. Mouse
and I had one too.

294
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,880
See, we needed a way
to make sure

295
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,680
the Caterpillar didn't figure out
what we were up to.

296
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,240
"Are there any lions
or tigers about here?"

297
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
"It's only the Red
King snoring."

298
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,960
<i>That was the little code
that the coast was clear</i>

299
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,400
<i>and we were safe.</i>

300
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,400
You made Chessie a sweater.

301
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,040
I cut up one of my blankets.

302
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,800
He looks so, so fancy.

303
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Johnny, get upstairs.
Time for chores.

304
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
What was that?

305
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
No, no.

306
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,440
You know these creatures
carry all manner of diseases.

307
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,680
Please, Daddy, no. It's my fault.
I brought him here.

308
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,040
Don't hurt him. Johnny can put
him back where he found him.

309
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Please...

310
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,520
<i>I guess you could say
he made the Cheshire Cat...</i>

311
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Disappear.

312
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
That's awful.

313
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Tell me...

314
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,840
How awful it will be...

315
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:19,240
when you lose the thing you love
so dearly?

316
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,440
If Kate's been kidnapped,
shouldn't we call my dad?

317
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,400
He'll know what to do.
He's Special Forces.

318
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,880
He's in jail.

319
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,200
- What?
- For killing your stepmother,

320
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,040
but he didn't do it. Alice did.

321
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Okay...

322
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,960
Dumb question,
do police exist on this Earth?

323
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,240
Yes. But honestly, the Wonderland
Gang is always a few steps ahead.

324
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,120
But fortunately, I got
a little something the cops don't.

325
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,400
And that is a GPS on Kate's bike.

326
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,960
The signal's weak. The transmitter
must've gotten damaged.

327
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,280
I just gotta find a way
to boost it enough

328
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,440
to get a lock on her location.

329
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,800
Then we send in the cavalry?

330
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,400
No. No. They'll be ready for that.

331
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,320
And that'll just get Kate
and the others killed.

332
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,600
This Mouse guy is demanding Alice,
yeah?

333
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,680
Well, what if we give her to him?

334
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,840
No. No. Sorry.

335
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,320
That's not gonna happen.

336
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,120
That's insane and Kate
would never let you.

337
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,400
Kate saved my life in my world.

338
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm gonna save her life in this one.

339
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,800
- Batwoman's gonna save us, right?
- Not sure I'd count on that.

340
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,720
Yeah. Because my idiot dad
isn't gonna turn on the Bat-Signal.

341
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,720
Dude, it's 2020. Nobody cares
about gay-straight anymore.

342
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,240
"Oh, my ears and whiskers,
how late it's getting."

343
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,240
Look, Alice.

344
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm gonna be honest with you.

345
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,920
My heart breaks for that little girl
who was trapped in that cell.

346
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,000
For everything that man did to her.

347
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,880
And I know somewhere deep down...

348
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,080
That little girl is still fighting
to get out.

349
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,840
Kate used to think that too.

350
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,440
But just like that little kitten...

351
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,520
Beth never made it out
of the basement.

352
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,480
<i>Did you make this?</i>

353
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,320
Did you make this?

354
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,720
Answer me!

355
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,960
My dad will kill you.

356
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,480
Oh, my dear.

357
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,560
Your father has already forgotten
about you.

358
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,160
You've been replaced.

359
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Now...

360
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,400
I want you to tell me,
did you make this?

361
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
Yes. I did.

362
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,080
Sorry.

363
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
Don't be sorry, my dear.

364
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,440
This is exactly...

365
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,400
The kind of delicate craftsmanship
that Johnny needs.

366
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Now...

367
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,920
I want you to use these nimble little
fingers...

368
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,520
to do exactly...

369
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,480
What you did with this sweater...

370
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
With these.

371
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,920
That was the day I learned
to make faces out of human skin.

372
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,320
First were the eyebrows.

373
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,640
Or was it the lips?

374
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
I don't remember.

375
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,320
Perhaps my thoughts
were so preoccupied

376
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,160
with the horrid realization

377
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,680
that no one was coming...

378
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,640
To rescue me.

379
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,680
So she's basically got two

380
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,920
go-to moves in
her repertoire of crazy.

381
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,200
Either say something terrible
in a really sweet voice,

382
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,400
or you say something sweet

383
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,480
but make it sound like
it's the scariest thing in the world.

384
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,320
She sounds lovely.

385
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,680
Yeah, and if you really get
into some trouble...

386
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,640
just throw out a random quote
from <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

387
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,320
"Curiouser and curiouser." Or...

388
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,840
"Off with her..."

389
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,560
- What? Do I look that bad?
- No, no.

390
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
You...

391
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,400
You look perfect.

392
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,640
- Then what is it?
- Just...

393
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,720
The last time
I looked into those eyes,

394
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,080
my mom was dying in my arms.

395
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,560
Poisoned... By Alice.

396
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,960
- So. it's just hard not to...
- Hate me?

397
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,480
I don't blame you.

398
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,680
Alice is...

399
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,600
Me. And I'm her.

400
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,000
At least, in some ways, I guess.

401
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,080
Which is why I can't help
but feel responsible

402
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,760
for what happened to your mom.

403
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,080
And I am so, so sorry.

404
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,440
You don't have to be.

405
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,480
You are nothing like that bitch.

406
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,600
I got a lock. I know where Kate is.
A scrapyard outside of town.

407
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,480
- Time's almost up!
- No.

408
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,440
- No, no, no, this is not...
- No. Please.

409
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,000
I can't die. I can't die.

410
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,920
"The Dormouse shook
its head impatiently

411
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,240
and said, without opening its eyes,

412
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,280
'Of course, of course, just what
I was going to remark myself.'"

413
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,960
They let you go?

414
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,840
You played your part well,
my little Mouse.

415
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,640
You made them fear you
and they set me free.

416
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,440
And alas, a deal's a deal.
And now we must do the same for them.

417
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,160
Why does she get to live?

418
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,760
She was perfectly happy
living her life without you.

419
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Now, it's time for you
to live yours without her.

420
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,520
Were you followed?

421
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,840
No. Of course not.

422
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,200
"Are there any lions
or tigers about here?"

423
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,240
What are you talking about?

424
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,640
"Are there any lions
or tigers about here?"

425
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,000
Who are you?

426
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
No!

427
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,720
Let me out! Help!

428
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,360
This is your last chance.

429
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,960
You can still be
the person you once were.

430
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,120
<i>If you say your wish out loud,
it will never come true.</i>

431
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,840
<i>Your father has already forgotten
about you.</i>

432
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,080
<i>I want you
to use these nimble little fingers.</i>

433
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Thank you...

434
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,680
For helping me look normal.

435
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,480
I'm sorry about the book,

436
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,080
but I got some
of my dad's fishing line.

437
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,920
It's really strong.

438
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,480
We can fix it, Beth.

439
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,680
I'm gonna call you my little Mouse.

440
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,440
And you can call me Alice.
Shall we have a tea party?

441
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,280
The book was my escape.

442
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,000
That's how you dealt
with all that trauma?

443
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,400
By creating an entirely different
reality and becoming someone else?

444
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,520
Isn't that what you did, Agent Moore?

445
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,560
Escaping your prison
by becoming someone else?

446
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,560
Lying to yourself and everybody else

447
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,960
about who you really are.

448
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,440
Retreating into the arms
of that yummy Boy Scout.

449
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,720
Get her out of here.

450
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,360
Maybe Arkham will
have better luck bringing out

451
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,000
- who you really are, Beth.
- This is who I really am.

452
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Drop it.

453
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,440
My dear sweet little birdie.

454
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,400
I may be free of my cage,
but you're still trapped in yours.

455
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,760
And you always will be.

456
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,840
Because it's one of your own making.

457
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,560
And that...

458
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:33,560
Is a hell more unbearable than...

459
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,520
- Hey!
- Hey, get me out of here!

460
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,440
- Let me out!
- Let me out!

461
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,920
Let me out! Please!

462
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,760
- Please help!
- Let me out!

463
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,280
Please, help. Please!

464
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,240
Get me out of here!

465
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,480
Help! Please. Let me out.
Let me out, please.

466
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,600
Let me out, let me out!

467
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,760
- Goddamn.
- Please get me out. Please.

468
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Get us out. Please, please.
Get me out. Please. Please, please.

469
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,560
Someone help. Please help me!

470
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
Kate!

471
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,960
Come on. Come on, hurry!

472
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Come on!

473
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,960
Get back, get back, get back.

474
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,920
<i>Evening, Gotham. Notice
how I didn't say "good evening"?</i>

475
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,480
<i>That's because
Alice is back on the streets.</i>

476
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,040
<i>And while Gotham's golden boys</i>

477
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,160
<i>may be safe
and snug in their beddy-byes,</i>

478
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,640
<i>I'll be sleeping
with a Louisville Slugger tonight,</i>

479
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,320
<i>because with Batwoman
on the GCPD's do-not-call list,</i>

480
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,880
<i>it's the only bat
that's going to protect me.</i>

481
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,040
Shut down Brown
and Loeb Bridge. Leave Trigate open.

482
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,600
Give her one way out.
Search every vehicle top to bottom.

483
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,560
If she tries it,
we'll stop her there.

484
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,680
What's the status on Mouse?

485
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,160
Just got out of surgery, in ICU.

486
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,520
I want a six-person team
on him around the clock.

487
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
Kate.

488
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,160
- How are you?
- I came to ask you the same thing.

489
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,800
Rattled, embarrassed, pissed.
Mostly pissed.

490
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,680
Well, I'm just glad you remembered
our code.

491
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,160
Of course I did.
I remember everything.

492
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,760
For example, happy birthday.

493
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,840
Did you get anything good,
besides kidnapped?

494
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,760
I did, I did, actually.

495
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,240
<i>And now with
the city gripped by fear</i>

496
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,160
<i>with reports of Alice's
bloody escape...</i>

497
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,960
What's going on at the GCPD?

498
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,920
<i>Protestors have taken
to the steps of the GCPD,</i>

499
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,160
<i>demanding that they turn
on the Bat-Signal.</i>

500
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,080
<i>Turn on the light! Turn on the light!</i>

501
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,800
<i>Turn on the light! Turn on the light!</i>

502
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,240
<i>Turn on the light!</i>

503
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,440
Sometimes this city surprises you.

504
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,560
<i>Turn on the light! Turn on the light!</i>

505
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,640
<i>Oh, now we know you're listening</i>

506
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,760
Turn on the light!

507
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,480
Turn on the light!

508
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,640
Turn on the light! Turn on the light!

509
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,840
Turn on the light! Turn on the light!

510
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,720
Turn on the light! Turn on the light!

511
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,120
Turn on the light! Turn on the light!

512
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,760
Turn on the light!

513
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,560
<i>Now, we know you're listening</i>

514
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,760
<i>We're the new tradition</i>

515
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,160
<i>Now, we know you're listening</i>

516
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,720
Any idea where she could be?

517
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
I don't know.

518
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,880
And I'm sorry, commander.

519
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,040
I should've listened to you.

520
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,880
- And now...
- You didn't kill those agents.

521
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
Alice did.

522
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Yeah.

523
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,720
But because of me,
now she's escaped.

524
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,200
That's how we're gonna stop her.

525
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,440
If anything happened to Alice
when she was in Crows's custody,

526
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,960
we'd have to answer for it.

527
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,200
But she's a fugitive now.

528
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,040
We could put a bullet in her
and no one would bat an eye.

529
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,120
It's time we do exactly that.

530
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,840
- Surprise!
- I had nothing to do with this.

531
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,600
Yeah, yeah. She told me
that you would hate this.

532
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,840
She would be right, ahem.
Twin intuition. Happy birthday, Beth.

533
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Happy birthday.

534
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,520
Your bar needs bigger glasses.

535
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,800
You know, I'll be honest,

536
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,400
I never really understood
why you were so hell-bent

537
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,720
on redeeming that psychopath Alice.

538
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,040
But now that I've met Beth,

539
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,640
I totally get it.
I see what you lost.

540
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,960
Yeah.

541
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
To miracles.

542
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,720
Actually, I don't think that,
that's what it is.

543
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,200
And this could just be
my little friend talking here,

544
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,400
but I read your sister's thesis

545
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,160
on extra-astral
galactic stuffy stuff.

546
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:08,400
I think Beth's being here
is some kind of cosmic anomaly.

547
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
Hear me out.

548
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,320
What if there are multiple universes?

549
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,520
Kind of like a bunch
of different planet Earths.

550
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,720
And then they all kind of...

551
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,960
Collapsed into one.

552
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,440
Only there were some parts left over.

553
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,240
Kind of like after you built
an Ikea bookshelf

554
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,800
and Beth is just one of the parts
that made it into the box somehow.

555
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,080
You know, you're right, it's crazy.

556
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,200
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

557
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,400
<i>Happy birthday</i>

558
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,840
Okay. Make a wish.

559
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,440
Well, all I ever really wanted
was a second chance.

560
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,280
And here you are, so...

561
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Here you go.

562
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Hey, hey.

563
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,200
Hey, what's happening?
Beth, what's happening? What is it?
