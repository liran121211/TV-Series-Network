1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,600
Oh, you think you're good?

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,320
Who's your daddy?

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,680
That's right. Me.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,200
Come on.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Come to Daddy.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Yes!

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,920
Finally.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,080
Hey, is there any more wine?

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,920
How did you beat him already?

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,280
I learned the secret
sucker punch combo.

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,000
The secret sucker punch combo
is the thing?

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,160
You know, which you would know about

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,480
if you, like, ever beat me, like,
one time.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,720
Okay. I'm sorry that I spent the best
video gaming years of my life

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,120
locked in a basement cell.

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,280
That's one way to take
someone's head off.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,760
She's giving me pointers
on how to be evil.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,640
Nice building.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,480
- I thought you renovated the place.
- I did.

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,640
Just badly, apparently.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,400
Is this really happening?

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,520
- What?
- Us.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,880
Bickering, drinking...

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,160
Playing video games.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,640
Like actual sisters?

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,360
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's happening.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,760
Hey, give me that. You suck.

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,400
I've had wine, so this will probably
be overly sentimental, but...

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,480
Thank you for never giving up on me.

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Hey.

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,560
It's like I've always said,
you're worth it.

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,600
- It's not a bad connection, is it?
- No, it's not.

33
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,760
But it was nice while it lasted.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
No.

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,440
Stop.

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,480
Let me stay here.

37
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,640
Let me stay here.

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,840
Let's try this again.

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,600
You live in a fantasy.

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,360
Fantasy is not reality.

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,080
This is your reality, Alice.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,520
All right. Okay, you caught me.

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Take the jewels.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,200
- What do I care?
- Consider this your warning.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,920
Whatever. Fine. I'm warned.

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,360
You're free. Go.

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,320
Don't be dead. Please.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
Come on. Live!

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,840
Wake up. Come on. Please.

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Wake up!

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Up here.

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,920
<i>Batwoman, you got company.</i>

53
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,680
<i>Talk to me, Batwoman.</i>

54
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,280
Your heart rate's off the charts.

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,840
<i>Kate, answer me. Are you okay?</i>

56
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,480
- Kate?
- I'm fine.

57
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,000
The hell?

58
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,120
Oh, no. No, no, no.

59
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,360
<i>Officer Wilcox, you have
a bomb strapped to your chest.</i>

60
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,800
<i>Don't worry. It's easy to disarm.</i>

61
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,360
<i>Simply push the yellow button
which will trigger a second bomb</i>

62
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,880
<i>I've planted somewhere else in
Gotham.</i>

63
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,240
- What?
<i>- That's right.</i>

64
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
<i>You disarm your bomb
to save yourself,</i>

65
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,360
<i>allowing countless others to die.</i>

66
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,000
<i>Or, you die and save all those people
you've never met</i>

67
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,040
<i>who will never know
of your sacrifice.</i>

68
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,560
<i>So, my friend, are you a hero?</i>

69
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,720
<i>The choice should be easy, right?</i>

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,920
<i>A hero would do anything
for his city. Would you...?</i>

71
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,320
<i>Now here's a blast from the past.</i>

72
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,000
<i>The Detonator is back
after a seven-year hiatus</i>

73
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,200
<i>and he's out to prove
there are no heroes left in Gotham.</i>

74
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,120
<i>Gotta admit, he made his point in
dynamite when a GCPD officer</i>

75
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,640
<i>blew up a bank last night
to save his own tail,</i>

76
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,840
<i>without even letting the timer
drop into the single digits.</i>

77
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,800
{\an5}<i>Talk to me, Gotham, are you a hero?</i>

78
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Again?

79
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,920
{\an5}You're the second one this week.
What happened?

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,840
{\an5}I was helping a guy out of the bomb
wreckage and the ceiling collapsed.

81
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,440
I'm gonna take a look at your ribs.

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,200
{\an5}No, don't cut it. No!
This thing took forever to make.

83
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,400
{\an5}So, insider tip?

84
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,000
{\an5}My scissors should not be able
to cut through your super suit.

85
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Why are you pretending
to be Batwoman?

86
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,160
{\an5}Because the real one is MIA

87
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
{\an5}and the city still has PTSD
from when Batman left.

88
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,040
{\an5}I thought, maybe, if people saw me

89
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,880
{\an5}and believed that she
was still around, then...

90
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
{\an5}I know. I'm an idiot.

91
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,760
{\an5}Your heart is in the right place,
your ribs, however, are not.

92
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,880
{\an5}Hey, you know people
in the underground.

93
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
{\an5}Do you know where she is?

94
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,240
{\an5}Trust me, I'm the last person
Batwoman would ever confide in.

95
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,400
{\an5}I left you like this a week ago
and now it smells like this.

96
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,400
{\an5}So, you just let yourself
into my home now?

97
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,240
{\an5}Yeah. And I could have been anyone.

98
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
{\an5}I remember this vile concoction.

99
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,800
{\an5}They don't call it Chimney Sweep
for nothing.

100
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Cheers.

101
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,440
{\an5}You haven't returned my texts.

102
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,760
{\an5}And while I'm decidedly not
that girl...

103
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,400
{\an5}Do we need to talk about
what happened the other night?

104
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,200
{\an5}Let's not turn this into a thing.

105
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
But...

106
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,000
{\an5}Thank you for...

107
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
Being there for you?

108
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,840
{\an5}No complaints from me, love.

109
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,400
{\an5}Gotham, on the other hand,

110
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,000
{\an5}feels right ghosted
by their caped crusader.

111
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
What's going on?

112
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,400
{\an5}Whenever I put that suit on, I...

113
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,480
I crossed a line
when I killed Cartwright.

114
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,680
What if l screw up
and kill someone else?

115
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,000
I see.

116
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,400
You want to punish yourself.

117
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,280
{\an5}Fine. You screwed up
and took a man's life.

118
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
{\an5}Bruce would be blustery
with disappointment.

119
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,880
And now you need to get over it.

120
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,240
{\an5}- That's your pep talk?
- Yeah. I'm needed elsewhere.

121
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,520
{\an5}And so are you. Someone bombed
Gotham International Bank last night.

122
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,640
{\an5}Killed a dozen people.

123
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,880
Vacation's over, Batwoman.

124
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,320
In my whole life,

125
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
my father urged me to hide my face.

126
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,480
To live in the shadows.

127
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,040
He claimed it was for my own good
to avoid ridicule.

128
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,120
But it turns out,
it was for his own good.

129
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
I hid for his comfort.

130
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,520
But the moment I realized I didn't
care if he was comfortable or not...

131
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,440
I became myself.

132
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,080
I became free.

133
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,960
What are you doing?

134
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm unburdening myself.

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,760
Unburdening yourself?

136
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,400
We are trapped in yet another cage
thanks to my traitorous sister.

137
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,400
It's not a cage, it's a sanctuary.

138
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,960
One where your family can't hurt you.

139
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,440
Where Safiyah can't find you.
Where we have each other.

140
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,440
What else do you need?

141
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,640
Alice, would you like to share?
We haven't heard from you yet.

142
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,040
I'm gonna pass. Yeah.

143
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,760
I've got something to share.

144
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,880
Oh, goodie. It's Tommy Elliot.

145
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,280
Excuse me. Ahem.

146
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,760
All right, Bruce Wayne
could speak over 40 languages.

147
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,320
That's four. Four, zero.

148
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,440
Mr. Elliot, this group
started 15 minutes ago.

149
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,280
Okay. Well, so sue me.

150
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,040
Oh, that's right, you can't,
because my...

151
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,760
My estate's been frozen.

152
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,680
Mr. Elliot, I am thrilled that our
therapy has converted your disdain

153
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,040
for Mr. Wayne
into a deeper appreciation,

154
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,560
but we do need to move
on to other topics.

155
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,000
What's wrong, doc?

156
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,520
It's, like, too crazy?

157
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,120
Because that one thinks she's a cat.

158
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,760
- That one thinks she's a myna bird.
- Magpie.

159
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,080
The name is Magpie.

160
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,280
Steals people's faces.

161
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,120
I mean, this one drools
so much the orderlies have

162
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,400
to follow him around
with a mop.

163
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
And, you know, what about me?
What about me?

164
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,320
I'm the guy that taught Bruce Wayne
everything he knows.

165
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,960
So, where's my recognition, doc?

166
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,040
- Get him out of here, please.
- No, no, no!

167
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,800
No, no, no!

168
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
No! Bruce is my best friend.

169
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,120
And when he hears about this,
he will end your career, doctor.

170
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,360
One of us!

171
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,840
I can't live like this.

172
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,920
My client Reggie Harris
was wrongly incarcerated for years,

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,560
<i>then gunned down
the same day he was freed.</i>

174
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
<i>Why?</i>

175
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
<i>What did he know?</i>

176
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,640
<i>I will not rest until his family sees
justice. Excuse me.</i>

177
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,560
<i>Bobby, Bobby, one more
question.</i>

178
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Michael Fisher?

179
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,720
Never heard of him.

180
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,640
Probably an alias.

181
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,080
But he killed Alia Nazari

182
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,200
and Reggie Harris and he tried
to kill me and my boss,

183
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,440
all to keep some cover-up
inside the Crows from getting out.

184
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,320
Which means we've got a juicy scandal
on our hands.

185
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,600
Assuming we can figure out
who he's working for.

186
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,760
This one's yours, extra pickles.

187
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,400
I'll look into his finances,

188
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,640
see if anyone's paying him
kill-four-people-in-one-day money.

189
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,120
I already did.

190
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,000
A wire was sent to his account
for 180 grand.

191
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,400
The day Reggie Harris was exonerated

192
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,640
for Lucius Fox's
murder.

193
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,120
Nicely done. I'll go pester
the bank manager, then.

194
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,320
Figure out who sent it.

195
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,520
- Which bank?
- Gotham International.

196
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
You're kidding.

197
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,520
- What?
- Gotham International Bank

198
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,480
is a pile of rubble, along with its
vault, its servers, backup servers.

199
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,880
Yeah, some bloke cleverly named
the Detonator bombed it last night.

200
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Do you think
he could be involved in this?

201
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
No.

202
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,560
I remember the Detonator.

203
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,600
He was active
long before Reggie was convicted.

204
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,800
All right, move over.

205
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
If we can't trace
our sniper's paychecks,

206
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,560
maybe we can figure out
his real name.

207
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
That's new.

208
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,760
Wanna talk about it?

209
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Not especially.

210
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,120
Luke,

211
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,560
the man you think killed
your father,

212
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,520
he was cleared and then shot
in front of you.

213
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,920
- Kind of think talking will be good.
- Then let's talk.

214
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,440
Why haven't you found anything
on Cartwright yet?

215
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,680
I don't know.
Maybe he's gone underground.

216
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,880
Well, while you've been away,
ignoring all my texts,

217
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,440
the bat light's gone unanswered.

218
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,640
Why do you think I'm here?

219
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,160
What do we know about the Detonator?

220
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,520
Seven years ago,
the Detonator crippled Gotham

221
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,080
with fear and uncertainty.

222
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,480
He's a terrorist
that targets the city's good guys

223
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,840
and compels them
to kill innocents at random.

224
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,800
The question is, why is he back now?

225
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
You want an honest answer to that?

226
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,680
You, Batwoman.

227
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,640
When the bat's away,
the crazies will play.

228
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,880
I've only been out a week.

229
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,920
The bad guys
are getting comfortable.

230
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,600
The Detonator targets people
the public views as heroes.

231
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,360
Doctors, police officers, firemen.

232
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,360
He wants to prove that they're not as
heroic as the world thinks they were.

233
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,040
Where'd you get these?

234
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,160
Bruce's research.

235
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,920
He was obsessed
with catching this guy.

236
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,000
Kept a long list of suspects,
but the trail

237
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,960
went cold before he could narrow it.

238
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,520
Two-one-four. The bomb that took out
Gotham International Bank

239
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,040
had these three numbers stamped
into the ground plate.

240
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,640
This signature matches all 15 bombs
detonated seven years ago.

241
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,080
To be clear, this information
was never released to the public.

242
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,480
Which eliminates the possibility
of a copycat. This is an original.

243
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,480
That is our assertion, although
we still don't know what 214...

244
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,000
actually means.

245
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,760
Anyone on that suspect list
with military experience?

246
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Yeah.

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, a couple.

248
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,600
Who's George Adler?

249
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,720
Private black-ops contractor.
He was fired for...

250
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,040
Yeah, that'll do it.

251
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,000
"He was caught taking selfies
with enemy corpses.

252
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,160
Adler was dishonorably discharged

253
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,560
from military school back
in the day."

254
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,000
No surprise there.

255
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,920
But clearly that wasn't enough
to implicate him in Bruce's mind.

256
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
Bruce didn't go to military school.

257
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,680
He wouldn't know the specific form
number on discharge papers.

258
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,240
DD-214.

259
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,760
I only know because Point Rock
put the same code on my papers.

260
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,440
So, the military deemed you
not good enough,

261
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,640
and now that very thing
is gonna save your city's ass.

262
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm just gonna leave that
little piece of irony right there.

263
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,920
I'll go talk to Adler.

264
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,560
Welcome back, Batwoman.

265
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,320
You should know,

266
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,480
your suit's nanotech
is designed to withstand detonation

267
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,160
over pressures
of ten pounds per square inch.

268
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,560
Gotham can be glad
their hero is bomb-proof.

269
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,920
That blast will knock off limbs
and topple buildings.

270
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,880
But if you see any evidence
of nuclear materials, uranium,

271
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,400
grapple the hell out of there.

272
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm not suiting up.

273
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm going as me.

274
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,600
Like a fledgling
real estate developer?

275
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,080
- I'm just gonna talk to him.
- You haven't been out

276
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,480
looking for Cartwright, have you?

277
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,160
Okay. Look, the Bat team
doesn't have an HR department,

278
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,080
so as your co-worker and partner

279
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,960
and pretty much only person you see
on a regular basis,

280
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,920
shouldn't I know
what the hell is going on with you?

281
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,960
If I told you the truth...

282
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,280
You would not want me
to suit up either.

283
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,520
- Bruce Wayne wannabe.
- I'm sorry, what did you just say?

284
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,880
Oh, your boyfriend Bruce?

285
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,640
- He'd think you were a loser.
- Hey, knock it off.

286
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,560
Don't you ever say his name.

287
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,360
You will never be Bruce Wayne.

288
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,560
I need a doctor!

289
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
George Adler?

290
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,720
- And you are?
- Kate Kane,

291
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,160
Gotham Pride Real Estate.

292
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,720
I'm in the process
of buying this building

293
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,440
and I have to photograph the units.

294
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
Yeah, you got paperwork or something?

295
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,120
My assistant will e-mail you.

296
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Really think he's back?

297
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
How the hell would I know?

298
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,360
- I thought you were in real estate.
- Where's the next bomb?

299
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,520
Who the hell are you?

300
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,960
Someone with an interest
in Gotham's property values.

301
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,960
Your obsession with explosives
isn't doing business any favors.

302
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,520
Hey, look, the bombs? That wasn't me.

303
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,640
I swear! It...

304
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,800
It was my old man. George Adler, Sr.

305
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Talk.

306
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,760
The first time he killed a guy,
I don't know,

307
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,560
it triggered something
dark.

308
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,520
Look, I don't expect
a billionaire to understand

309
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,560
how taking a man's life
screws with your head.

310
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Try me.

311
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,560
He snapped... okay?

312
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,320
He wanted to show people

313
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,520
that it's a lot harder
to act like a hero

314
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,520
when you're in the heat of it,
staring down your own death.

315
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
- Where is he now?
- Gotham Cemetery.

316
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
What?

317
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,560
He's dead. Died seven years ago.

318
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,480
No! No, no, no. Don't do this to me!

319
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
<i>The charismatic defense
attorney</i>

320
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,000
<i>who claims to stand up
for the little guys, the everyman.</i>

321
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,440
<i>What a hero.</i>

322
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,000
<i>Now you have a choice.</i>

323
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,040
Looking for me?

324
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,840
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

325
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,080
No thanks to security. That's you.

326
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,520
They put Tommy in solitary.

327
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,080
Good.

328
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Little does he know,

329
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,600
the Bruce-obsessed Neanderthal
played his part to a T.

330
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,360
I asked the nurse to be thorough.

331
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,800
What are you...? You're bleeding.

332
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,360
It's only temporary, Mouse.

333
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,920
Plus, what's a little blood
if it ensures our freedom?

334
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,480
I can't do this. I have a family.

335
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,880
You called us for a reason.
You know that.

336
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,440
Lives depend on you staying calm
and doing the right thing.

337
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,000
Jacob, look, I'm no hero, okay?

338
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,880
You have to be one today.

339
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,520
It's down to 22 minutes.

340
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,760
That's 22 minutes to get everyone
out, so you can push that button.

341
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,960
You just hang tight.

342
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,680
The Detonator wants his victims
to hear the explosion they've caused.

343
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,280
That means the secondary explosive

344
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,800
is likely within a one-mile radius
of Bobby Reeves.

345
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,640
Bomb squad's on its way to Bobby.

346
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,520
This guy uses half a dozen trip
wires.

347
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,920
If we wanna save lives,

348
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,760
we need to clear that mile
in less than a half hour.

349
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,840
- Bobby, you still with me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

350
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,160
The Detonator's dead.
It's gotta be a copycat.

351
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,520
You sure junior didn't pick up
where his old man left off?

352
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,560
<i>He was at work. Alibi checks out.</i>

353
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Crap.

354
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,960
We're out of time, Kate.
The Detonator has another victim.

355
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,960
Crows and GCPD
are clearing buildings now.

356
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,040
- Where is it?
<i>- Doesn't say.</i>

357
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,880
<i>But they're clearing Wiget
and Brighton.</i>

358
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,520
- Isn't that right by...?
<i>- Mary.</i>

359
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,280
Residents are to take only pets
and leave everything else behind.

360
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,720
Follow authorities
to the nearest checkpoint

361
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,080
and not to return under
any circumstances

362
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,240
until the threat
has been neutralized.

363
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,000
<i>We will continue to bring you live
updates</i>

364
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,760
<i>on this evacuation and bomb scare...</i>

365
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,520
Go straight on Brighton.
You'll hit a police barricade.

366
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,480
You'll be safe from there, okay? Go.

367
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,240
- Mr. Whittaker, we need to move you.
- Okay.

368
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,280
- Get him to a checkpoint.
- You need to come with.

369
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,360
Nobody knows this clinic exists.

370
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,120
They're gonna detonate that bomb
whether this place is clear or not.

371
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Come on.

372
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm not leaving them.

373
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Go.

374
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,800
Hey, Bobby, you're doing great.

375
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,480
- You gotta get this thing off of me.
- Oh, we will. We will.

376
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,600
But we need to give our guys
more time to clear the area.

377
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,000
I... I can't do it.

378
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,120
I can't!

379
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,840
You're gonna do the right thing.

380
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,440
<i>Under order of Mayor Akins,</i>

381
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,600
<i>all civilians are ordered
to evacuate immediately.</i>

382
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,760
<i>Do not hesitate.
Do not pack your belongings.</i>

383
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,360
<i>Humans and pets only. If you
can hear this message, evacuate now.</i>

384
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,120
Come on.

385
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,960
This is the last building
on this block.

386
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,480
I promise you
this is just a precaution,

387
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,880
like the fire drills you
had as a kid.

388
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
What can I do?

389
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,200
Why did you come back?
You need to get out of here.

390
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,440
These people need help.

391
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,560
Get everyone on the ground.

392
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,080
If they can't move, try
and cover them with a mattress

393
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,520
and pray this building
passed its earthquake inspection.

394
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,160
Mary.

395
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
GCPD just gave the all clear.

396
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,840
Okay, Bobby.

397
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,200
<i>Gotham is under a mandatory lockdown.
The streets are not safe.</i>

398
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,320
<i>Remain in your homes.</i>

399
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,000
<i>Gotham is under a mandatory lockdown.</i>

400
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,920
<i>The streets are not safe.
Remain in your homes.</i>

401
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Mary!

402
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,120
Help, please!

403
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,920
Who is this?

404
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,680
Isn't it obvious?

405
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,680
She's Batwoman.

406
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
I have to go.

407
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,400
You wanna know
why people like her exist?

408
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,640
Or why they keep on showing up
to spread hope?

409
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,720
It's because you inspired them
and now they feel abandoned.

410
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,200
- What? What are you talking about?
- Please, Kate.

411
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,720
I know you're Batwoman.

412
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
I mean...

413
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,640
I just can't believe
I didn't figure it out sooner.

414
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,080
But of course, Batwoman's the same
girl who hunted down Derrick Peters

415
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,840
and locked him in a urinal
after he ditched me at homecoming.

416
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,880
And, of course,
the maniac on the bat bike...

417
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,520
Is the same maniac
who taught me how to drive

418
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,720
without actually having her license.

419
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
And totally charmed her
way out of a ticket

420
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,960
after my ass got us pulled over.

421
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,440
It couldn't be more obvious.

422
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,200
Batwoman is the same person
I've looked up to my entire life.

423
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,800
And now the city needs you
as much as I do.

424
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,240
It's not that simple.

425
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,760
It never is.

426
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,120
But Batwoman doesn't get a sick day.

427
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,160
- I'm not a hero, Mary.
- I'm not asking you to be a hero.

428
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,440
I'm just asking you to keep going.

429
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,440
And how are we feeling today, Johnny?

430
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,360
I think I had another moment
of clarity, Dr. Butler.

431
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Really?

432
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,360
And what was that?

433
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,160
Well, you know, I have almost
everything that I want here.

434
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,000
Shelter, protection, my sister.

435
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,200
And what is it you're still missing?

436
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Power.

437
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,280
Feel that, Dr. Butler?

438
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,640
This is your reality now.

439
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,480
Took a minute, but we figured
out the real identity

440
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,480
of the sniper who
killed Reggie Harris.

441
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,640
He lived at 2420 Maple Street.

442
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,000
The same 2420 Maple Street
that blew up?

443
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,920
Eviscerating all evidence linking
him back to whoever hired him.

444
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,960
- Great.
- In the last week alone,

445
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
everyone with any knowledge

446
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,360
of your father's real murderer
has been killed.

447
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,960
We think the Detonator hired the
sniper to kill Reggie Harris

448
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,760
and used these bombs
to cover his scent.

449
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,880
Except the Detonator's dead.

450
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,320
We're dealing with a copycat.
Real Detonator died seven years ago.

451
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,880
Which means
that we're looking for someone

452
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,320
who's intimately familiar
with the Detonator's case.

453
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,520
But who'd have had access
to the report?

454
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,640
It depends. Who was the
investigating officer at the time?

455
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Miguel Robles. He was a rookie cop
on the Detonator investigation team.

456
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,120
Robles is head
of the Crows Homicide Division.

457
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,840
That's pretty high up
in your bird's nest.

458
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,560
After Lucius was killed,

459
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,440
the Crows paid Alia Nazari
a 50 grand clean-up fee

460
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,920
for the destruction
of her Sip and Dash.

461
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,520
The commander was worried it was a
payoff to delete the surveillance,

462
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,760
but Robles was convinced
the payment

463
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,080
wasn't out of the
ordinary.

464
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,160
He was also the first to arrive
at the Sip and Dash that night.

465
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,960
This guy's hands are in everything.

466
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,880
I want every piece of shrapnel
collected and tested for prints.

467
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,920
We'll find him
before he strikes again.

468
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,080
<i>- You're wrong. I am not a killer.
- Yet.</i>

469
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
<i>You're scared you're becoming
like me.</i>

470
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,560
<i>You wanted this.</i>

471
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,160
<i>You left Cartwright for me to find.
You wanted to push me over the edge.</i>

472
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,600
<i>You set me up to kill him,
so that I would be like you.</i>

473
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,360
<i>Kate, you can't give me
all the credit.</i>

474
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,960
<i>After all, it wasn't that hard to...</i>

475
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,680
<i>I'm not asking you to be a hero.</i>

476
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,800
<i>I'm just asking you to keep going.</i>

477
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,520
<i>Jacob Kane, city savior.</i>

478
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,240
<i>You had to see this coming, right?</i>

479
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,200
Hang on, you think our bomber
is a Crow?

480
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,160
Robles was at the scene
of my dad's murder.

481
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,600
- The facts line up.
<i>- Where is he?</i>

482
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,560
I just got a ping on his phone.

483
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,560
He's crossing
the 1200 block of Rucka Ave.

484
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,960
<i>He's headed for the bridge
out of Gotham.</i>

485
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Got him.

486
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,960
What's going on? I heard gunshots.

487
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,440
Our boy Robles seems pretty eager
to get out of town.

488
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,640
You see the badge, bitch?

489
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I'm a Crow.

490
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,640
And I'm gonna destroy you.

491
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,080
Like you did Reggie Harris?

492
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,000
Or Alia Nazari or the dozen people
at Gotham International?

493
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,120
- What do you want?
- The truth.

494
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,800
Did you kill Lucius Fox?

495
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,880
Who wants to know?

496
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,040
His kid?
He's never gonna be able to prove it.

497
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Why?

498
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,440
I tie up loose ends.

499
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,120
- Luke, evacuate the building.
- What the hell is going on?

500
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,840
Disarm the damn bomb
or we both blow up in here.

501
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,800
I can't. Only way to disarm it
is for the other bomb to go off.

502
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,920
And where is that?

503
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,000
Ask Commander Kane.

504
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,920
Robles? No.

505
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,120
No, he wouldn't do this.

506
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,560
I didn't wanna believe it either,
but the evidence is there.

507
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,720
Even though he killed a lot of people
trying to cover it up.

508
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,600
- Tuxedo One here.
- It's me.

509
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,960
The second bomb is at Wayne.

510
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,760
Do not let anyone touch that button
until I give the all clear.

511
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,440
Copy that. Good luck.

512
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,000
Second bomb's at Wayne Tower.

513
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,560
- Says who?
- An associate.

514
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Got you.

515
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,800
- Didn't realized you had associates.
- Just the one.

516
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Call Kate.

517
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,360
Tell her to stay away
from that building.

518
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
- On it.
- Sir, I can deactivate two

519
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,040
of the trip wires, but there's
a pressure plate on your chest.

520
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,320
- If I move it, I can...
- Don't.

521
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,160
We'll let it tick down until
we can clear the area around Wayne.

522
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,200
You move the truck or tamper
with the timer, it blows.

523
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,120
If you don't disarm it, it blows.

524
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,160
- I need him alive.
- Luke.

525
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,640
- What are you doing?
- Introducing myself...

526
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,800
to the guy who killed my father.
Get up!

527
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,520
I said get up!

528
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
Look at me!

529
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,720
Luke, this bomb goes off in five
minutes.

530
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,520
Well, it's a good thing
my dad planned for that.

531
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
The city's safe.

532
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,000
Now the bomb blows up this room
and only this room.

533
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,560
You really wanna die a coward,
Robles? Don't.

534
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
You're fast,...

535
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,360
but you're not that fast.

536
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
I'll talk, just...

537
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
- put the gun down.
- Why did you kill...

538
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
My dad?

539
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,920
- Money.
- Money?

540
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,920
- Whose money?
- That rich asshat Tommy Elliot.

541
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,240
Why would Tommy Elliot
want Lucius Fox dead?

542
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,320
He had a book.

543
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,880
- Some journal Lucius was writing.
- What journal?

544
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
No idea.

545
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,960
All I know is that Tommy
was obsessed with it

546
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,760
and after I was recruited to
the Crows,

547
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,160
I was put on Tommy's personal detail.

548
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,160
He paid me 10 grand
to rough Lucius up.

549
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,080
You shot him in the chest!

550
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,240
By mistake.

551
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,480
I told your old man if he
didn't give Tommy what he wanted,

552
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,720
I would turn my attention...

553
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
To his kid.

554
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
You.

555
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,360
That set him off, he charged,

556
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,640
I pulled the trigger
and then it just snowballed.

557
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,200
After that I framed Reggie

558
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,680
and I spent the last four years
just covering up...

559
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,640
It's my fault. I started
the Crows to protect Gotham.

560
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,880
Now the whole city's on lockdown
because of me.

561
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,080
Robles going rogue is not your fault.

562
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,040
It's a high density blast radius.
They're still evacuating.

563
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,240
You should get out of here.

564
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
I'm on comms with Batwoman waiting
for the go-ahead.

565
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,560
So, if anything,
you should go.

566
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,400
I'm not leaving my boss.

567
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,280
Looks like we're stuck with each
other, then.

568
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,560
Luke, you need to get out of here.

569
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,320
There is a bomb strapped
to my dad and I...

570
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,480
I need to give him the green light
to disarm it.

571
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Luke.

572
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,320
He took everything from me.

573
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Killing him...

574
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,960
It won't change what happened
to your dad.

575
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,960
So, we just hand him over to the same
court that convicted Reggie Harris?

576
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,200
No, I'm dealing with this my way.

577
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,360
I killed Cartwright.

578
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
What?

579
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,880
- What?
- I didn't wanna suit up

580
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,600
because I feel like a fraud
in this thing.

581
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,200
I had every chance
to stop myself and I didn't.

582
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,840
Luke,

583
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,200
the world is short on heroes.

584
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,680
Do not let your anger turn you
into someone that you're not.

585
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
Grab his arms.

586
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,000
<i>Julia, hit it.</i>

587
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Do it.

588
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,360
Couldn't have done
this without you, Moore.

589
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,160
Glad to officially be back, sir.

590
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,640
Formalities aside, this is the start
of a major overhaul.

591
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,520
Robles gave up everyone
who took part in Harris' frame job

592
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,840
to avoid the death penalty.

593
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,680
We are draining the swamp.

594
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,280
I'm putting a new strike team in
place and you are co-heading it.

595
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
I'm not capable of running it solo?

596
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,680
So, I just got off the phone
with my agency.

597
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,720
Apparently, I've been recruited
to run a Crows strike team.

598
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,520
Co-run, technically.

599
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,280
So, where do you wanna start?

600
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,280
Personal detail, homicide squad?

601
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,520
With burgers.

602
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,680
Good ones, not the garbage

603
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,880
you've been bringing
to the motel all week.

604
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,680
Go on, then, twist my arm.

605
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,760
You're buying.

606
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Company card.

607
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,280
You'll get yours at orientation.

608
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,800
Bomb squad just left.

609
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,120
They're gonna
have some follow-up questions,

610
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,760
but since you weren't here...

611
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Thanks.

612
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,680
I should be thanking you

613
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,680
for talking me
off the ledge last night.

614
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,880
That's what partners are for.

615
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
Hey.

616
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,160
Do you know anything about this
journal that Tommy Elliot wanted?

617
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,520
Yeah, let's just say
my dad's journals

618
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,160
weren't poems about his feelings.

619
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,160
This was an instruction manual

620
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,600
to building every piece
of Wayne technology.

621
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Well...

622
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,680
It's a good thing
that Batwoman's back.

623
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,600
Why didn't you tell me
about Cartwright?

624
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Honestly...

625
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,840
Sometimes, I feel like you think
I'm some infallible hero

626
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,440
that makes the right choice
every single time.

627
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,520
I just...

628
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,680
I didn't wanna see the look on your
face when you were wrong.

629
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
I'm not wrong.

630
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,640
- I broke Batman's code.
- You think you're the only one?

631
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,360
Ever wonder why the Joker
hasn't reared his head in five years?

632
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,640
He's not in Arkham, Kate.

633
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,360
Both you and Bruce stared
into the abyss.

634
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,640
The question is,

635
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,400
how long are you gonna
let it stare back at you?

636
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,360
Okay, so I assume that you've seen
this, because you look good.

637
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,720
Hi, Mary. Kate's not Batwoman.

638
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,440
That would be a major time suck

639
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,880
from real estate development,
her actual job.

640
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,800
It's fine, she knows.

641
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,320
She knows...?
She knows what, exactly?

642
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,960
Yeah, we don't have to play
this little game, anymore.

643
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,160
What game? So you know what?
Kate,

644
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,480
you have a showing in 15 minutes.

645
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,720
You should really get going.

646
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,240
I'll let you two work this one out.

647
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,200
Yeah, great. So, you know what,
I'm gonna...

648
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,840
You e-mail me
that investment strategy

649
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,200
and I'll forward you back

650
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
some comps about the building's
blueprints

651
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
and we'll make sure to get
on the numbers.

652
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,680
Now, you're just saying words.

653
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,680
Time for your therapy, young lady.

654
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,200
It is amazing what I can do

655
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,280
with a sharp edge
and a little threads...

656
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,600
Chief Physician Butler.

657
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,360
What do you say
we hit up the ice cream cart

658
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,720
before we skip
our way right out the front door?

659
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,440
I was thinking about what you said
about the allure of this place.

660
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,200
The protection, the anonymity.

661
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,080
The way the walls help the
outside world forget all about us.

662
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,960
Why be rats on the streets of Gotham
when we can be royalty in here?

663
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,200
You will be queen

664
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,240
and I will be king.

665
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,400
And when everyone has forgotten us,
we'll remind them who we are.

666
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,720
And they will never,
ever forget us again.

667
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,600
<i>Now the lines are blurred
And faded</i>

668
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,480
<i>No one ever starts that way</i>

669
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,280
<i>This is how villains are made</i>

670
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,200
<i>This is how villains are made</i>
