00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:02,533
Previously on "Batwoman"...

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,165
I lost my sister Beth. Remember her?

3
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:08,407
Beth has gone down, down,
down the rabbit hole,

4
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,576
and she's never coming back.

5
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,536
Alice is looking for a Mouse.

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,925
She has big plans for him.

7
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:15,539
- What is...
- Chipped him.

8
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:16,582
He leads me to Alice,

9
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:17,916
I figure out who Mouse is.

10
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,749
I never understood why you stopped

11
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:20,901
looking for me.

12
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:22,545
I always thought a father would do

13
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:24,728
anything to find his daughter.

14
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:28,059
I won't let you forget
me, Commander, not again.

15
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:45,540
You'd think having spent 9 months

16
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:47,571
in our mother's womb together

17
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:51,089
and every other day for 13 years,

18
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,758
we wouldn't be such great mysteries

19
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:57,465
to one another, but we are.

20
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:07,800
I don't know what
the rest of her story is,

21
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:10,969
but that's the puzzle
I'm determined to solve...

22
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,567
Before it's too late.

23
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:22,770

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

24
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,501
They're calling him the Skin Pirate

25
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:31,152
because apparently he likes
to take skin from the booty.

26
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:33,741
- Never say that again.
- I didn't write the article.

27
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:35,392
Point being whatever
they're calling him,

28
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,061
he has quite the work ethic.

29
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:39,206
He hit 3 morgues in one night,

30
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,825
and all 3 break-ins
were 9 minutes apart.

31
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:43,285
That's a pretty tight window.

32
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:46,881
Yeah. Calculating the
quickest route between them.

33
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:49,466
Can you get eyes on that?

34
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:51,344
Yeah.

35
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,082
It looks like our he is a she.

36
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:59,229
Does she look familiar to you?

37
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:03,395
- Is that Alice?
- No.

38
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:04,847
You sure about that? Hang on.

39
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,175
She's not the Skin Pirate, okay?

40
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:07,426
It's too sick even for her.

41
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:09,237
Let's not forget we
have access to something

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,715
the GCPD doesn't...

43
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:12,721
Wayne's closed circuit cameras.

44
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:15,745
There aren't many, but let's
see if they caught anything.

45
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,585
Yeah. Yeah. That's her.

46
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:24,595
I'll look into whatever the hell

47
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:26,328
she could be using the skin for

48
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,257
if you remind me to clear
my image search history.

49
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,722
- What are you doing?
- Stopping her.

50
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:35,538
Whatever she's got planned
for Gotham ends today.

51
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,231
You don't even know where she is.

52
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:39,394
Nope, but I put a tracker in Dodgson.

53
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:42,919
I know where he is, and she
likes to keep her toys close.

54
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:45,088
Bruce doesn't have night vision goggles.

55
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,342
Batman doesn't do goggles.

56
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,764
Forgetting pain is convenient.

57
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:58,648
Remembering it, agonizing,

58
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:01,560
but recovering the truth

59
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:05,348
is worth the suffering.

60
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,328
Now tell me the truth.

61
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:11,727
What did you reveal to her?

62
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,876
Nothing. I wouldn't betray you.

63
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,163
Good. Because if you ruin

64
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,593
all I have been working for,

65
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:28,708
off... with... your... head.

66
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,407
Hmm. It looks like my dear sister

67
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,103
wasn't very kind to you, was she?

68
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:40,407
It's only a matter of
time before she gets hers.

69
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:53,431
Aah!

70
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:21,884
I'm not afraid of the dark,

71
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,579
and I'm not afraid of you!

72
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:25,064
Show yourself!

73
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,323
Heh.

74
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:42,246
Kinky... even for you.

75
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,966
Stealing skin off corpses...

76
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:45,698
Sadistic, even for you.

77
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:48,702
Key word... corpses.

78
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,422
I didn't hurt anyone.

79
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:53,066
What's the skin for?

80
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:55,760
You hit 3 morgues in one night.

81
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,563
You're working on something.

82
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,882
Dodgson said, uh, you
had plans with a Mouse.

83
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:07,075
Heh heh. Oh, I'm sure he
said lots of silly things

84
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:10,920
when your attention-starved
stepsister illegally drugged him.

85
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:12,607
Is Mouse a real person or a figment

86
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,777
of your imagination?

87
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,113
And what are you two planning?

88
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,780
If you keep going down this
road, it's gonna end badly,

89
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,258
but it doesn't have to.

90
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:29,161
I can get you into a
rehabilitation hospital,

91
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:30,895
a real one, Beth.

92
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:38,951
Nice try, but Alice will do.

93
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:42,394
You're gonna have to give me something.

94
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:45,154
Mouse was the one who
found me after the crash.

95
00:05:45,157 --> 00:05:48,376
You do remember the crash?

96
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,628
What happened to you?

97
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,841
Aren't you the great detective?

98
00:05:52,844 --> 00:05:54,343
Figure it out!

99
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:56,030
Heh.

100
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:00,962
- What are you doing?
- Calling Dad,

101
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:03,082
just letting him know I'm with you.

102
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:04,628
But he'll track your phone,

103
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,248
and if he finds us,
he'll ruin all our fun.

104
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:09,287
And he'll send you straight to Arkham.

105
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,622
- Kate?
- Hi, Dad.

106
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,836
I'm with Alice.

107
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,576
What do you mean you're with Alice?

108
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:15,628
I have her.

109
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:17,065
Well, where are you? I'll send a team.

110
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:19,986
I'm fine. She's... contained.

111
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:23,231
- Kate?
- Just thought you should know.

112
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,325
Clock's ticking. Start talking.

113
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:28,290
Fine, but I'll have to show you.

114
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:31,077
Show me? Heh. I don't think so.

115
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,724
The clock's tick, tick, ticking.

116
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,791
Let me down, and I'll tell you

117
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:38,531
all about my...

118
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:41,152
Long, sad tale.

119
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:51,329
Hmm. So where to begin.

120
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:54,808
I suppose it started... Tsh, tsh, tsh...

121
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,795
14 months before Catherine
Hamilton faked my death.

122
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:00,847
What are you talking about?

123
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:06,562
Oh. No one told you.
Hmm. That is so them.

124
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:08,845
Those bones, they belonged to a deer.

125
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:11,033
Our stepmother faked my DNA results,

126
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:15,737
and Daddy just found out
he had a funeral for Bambi.

127
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:18,305
I wonder if they have a prenup.

128
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:20,299
The bones at Miller Farm.

129
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:22,111
You don't seem that surprised.

130
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:24,114
Is that because deep
down you always knew

131
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:26,910
those bones weren't mine?

132
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,219
And now you know why.

133
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:29,562
Am I supposed to turn somewhere?

134
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:34,704
You're not asking the
right questions, Kate.

135
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:38,477
What is my evil plan?
Who am I targeting next?

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,147
How am I gonna do it?

137
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,359
When you really need to be asking why?

138
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,054
- Why am I like this?
- Okay. Why?

139
00:07:47,057 --> 00:07:50,197
Oh, you don't want to know that.

140
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,502
I have waited 15 years to hear it.

141
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:57,504
Well, it all began with
an unfortunate event

142
00:07:57,507 --> 00:08:00,313
which I remember vividly,

143
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:04,791
and if given the chance again,
I would take it back in a heartbeat.

144
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:10,050
It was a simple, effortless thing

145
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:13,109
that I had done so many times before.

146
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:17,105
I woke up.

147
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,922
Dad, she woke up.

148
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:30,802
Oh, hi. You must be terrified.

149
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:33,147
What's your name?

150
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,432
Beth. Where am I?

151
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:38,485
Hello, Beth. You're okay.

152
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:40,828
My son Johnny and I were
fishing in the river,

153
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:42,838
and we saw you along the rocks.

154
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:44,713
Any idea how you got there?

155
00:08:44,716 --> 00:08:46,257
Where's my mom?

156
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,377
Well, the police will be here soon.

157
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,949
I'm sure they can call her for you.

158
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:51,910
No. She was in the car
with me. She needs help.

159
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:53,663
It's gonna be okay, all right?

160
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,189
- Are you hungry?
- I want my dad.

161
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:01,150
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.

162
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,309
The little boy just sat there

163
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:08,970
with his hair in his eyes,

164
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:11,073
playing with his trucks.

165
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:13,758
For him, it was an ordinary day...

166
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:19,480
But for me, it was the
first worst day of my life.

167
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,644
What was the man's name?

168
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,955
Oh, I have no idea.

169
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,957
What do you mean you have no idea?

170
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,051
He rescued you.

171
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:30,987
It'll all make more
sense when we arrive.

172
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,991
Go down the road a mile, take a right,

173
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:36,661
go two miles, and
there's a roadside diner.

174
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:39,422
Consider it your first
stop down the rabbit hole.

175
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:45,503
It doesn't make sense.

176
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:47,463
Why would she call you and
not tell you where she was?

177
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:49,385
No idea. She knows I'll trace the call.

178
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,768
Maybe that was her intention.

179
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,054
We should get a team together.

180
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,844
No. No. For now, it's just you and me.

181
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:58,361
Sir, it's Alice. I don't
need to read you her résumé.

182
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,661
And I don't need another standoff
like we had in Burnside Park.

183
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:04,949
Found her.

184
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,482
She's headed west on the interstate.

185
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:08,170
Let's go.

186
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:11,552
I don't get it. How could they mix up

187
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:13,274
animal bones with human ones?

188
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:15,514
I mean, the bone density alone
should have tipped them off.

189
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,217
Not to mention the fact that the
genomes are completely different.

190
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:19,320
Because it wasn't a mix-up.

191
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:24,917
It was a lie.

192
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:28,791
What? Are you covering
up for the lab's mistake?

193
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,172
Mom, you don't have to do that, okay?

194
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:34,750
You can just tell me
the truth, and we can...

195
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:36,061
I am.

196
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:39,640
I was trying to give
Jacob and Kate closure.

197
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:41,626
No. You wouldn't do that

198
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:43,313
because that would be...

199
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:45,471
That would be horrible.

200
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:50,401
I am so sorry, Mary,

201
00:10:50,403 --> 00:10:52,028
but I wanted you to hear it from me,

202
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,789
not from Jacob or Kate, from me.

203
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,679
I know you, okay?

204
00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:59,224
I know you,

205
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:02,972
so please tell me you didn't do this.

206
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,992
Oh. Uh, two beers, please.

207
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,637
None for me.

208
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,779
You do not want to be sober
for the remainder of this story.

209
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,331
Trust me.

210
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,884
Ahem. Just the one beer.

211
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:50,263
Right back with that.

212
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,962
We're here. Talk,

213
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:55,275
and what does this place
have to do with anything?

214
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:57,922
Well, when your life
unfolds into a nightmare,

215
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,000
you pray your dreams
will take you elsewhere.

216
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:04,025
I used to dream of running away
with you to a place like this,

217
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:08,029
and then my hunger would wake me.

218
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:11,399
Alas, it wasn't meant to be.

219
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:14,664
This would be entirely
easier with two free hands.

220
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:19,127
You're my sister, Alice.

221
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,541
We spent half our lives together.

222
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:26,228
Where did that person go?

223
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:28,172
Down, down, down the rabbit hole.

224
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:30,976
Look. I'm done messing around.

225
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:33,978
If you're gonna talk, talk.

226
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:36,741
If not, we'll just sit here

227
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:39,453
and wait for Dad to find us.

228
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:44,509
As I was saying,

229
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:47,110
I remember it like it was yesterday...

230
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:51,091
The toys, the books, the treats.

231
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:53,452
Upstairs, there was a room

232
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:56,423
like a child's wonderland.

233
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,976
It was Mouse's room.

234
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:59,920
Goonies never say die!

235
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:01,756
He went by Johnny then.

236
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,690
It's leviosa,

237
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:05,585
not leviosar.

238
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:08,806
I can do any voice I hear.

239
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,631
You kids want lemonade?

240
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:13,447
Who else has come

241
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,491
to ease our woes?

242
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,061
Cinderella!

243
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,606
Why do you cover your face like that?

244
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:21,710
To hide what happened in the accident.

245
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,822
You shouldn't have to hide who you are.

246
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:25,419
I'll scare people.

247
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:27,380
You don't scare me.

248
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:30,537
We interrupt this program
with breaking news.

249
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:33,291
Police announced earlier that
they've expanded their search

250
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:36,233
for the missing Kane girl
to the county of Blüdhaven.

251
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:38,035
Police and volunteers have been...

252
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:39,796
Wait. Your dad said
he called the police.

253
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,090
Why don't they know I'm here?

254
00:13:41,093 --> 00:13:43,093
The family says a
reward is being offered

255
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:44,989
for any tips...

256
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,198
Johnny, no more TV today.

257
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,276
They're looking for me.
We have to call the police.

258
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,601
I told you, Beth. They'll be here soon.

259
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:55,247
We don't want you to leave us.

260
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,690
Please. Let me go! You're hurting me!

261
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:00,982
- Dad!
- Johnny, stay here!

262
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:02,484
Please! Aah! Let me go!

263
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:04,136
- Dad!
- Let me go!

264
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,914
Aah! Stop it, please!

265
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:08,784
Ow! Stop, please. Let me go now, please!

266
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:11,496
Aah! I'm sorry!

267
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,159
No!

268
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:16,433
No, no. Let me out.

269
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:18,441
No. Let me out!

270
00:14:27,874 --> 00:14:29,790
Aah!

271
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:36,627
And that was just the first day.

272
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:39,634
Hmm. I think she'll take that drink now.

273
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:51,366
Kate! Kate, I need to talk to you, okay?

274
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:53,930
I hate her, too! Kate!

275
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:56,216
Here she is. Wouldn't
stop trying to buzz in,

276
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:58,263
insisting she's related to Ms. Kane.

277
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,099
- But I am.
- And...

278
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:02,275
I'll take it from here. Thanks, Carl.

279
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:08,187
Uh, can I help you,
possibly to an AA meeting?

280
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:10,266
That depends. Is your name Kate?

281
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:11,577
Most definitely not.

282
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,214
Then can you tell her that I'm here?

283
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:14,533
I'm sorry. Who's here?

284
00:15:14,536 --> 00:15:18,468
Mary, Kate's soon-to-be ex-stepsister,

285
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,944
and you are?

286
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:22,534
Luke, Kate's, uh, associate, assistant,

287
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:23,645
real estate person.

288
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:24,823
Look. Kate's not here.

289
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:31,496
You know what? You could
leave her a message.

290
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,758
Okay.

291
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:37,140
Tell her... that I'm so sorry

292
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:39,601
I was ever born from the
wicked witch of Gotham,

293
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,362
and I get why she's avoiding me,

294
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,255
but I'm totally on her side.

295
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:46,576
I can't believe that my mom
would ever do something so awful.

296
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,818
Oh, my God. Do you think that
she killed that deer, too?

297
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:52,563
Are you getting any of this?

298
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:55,234
All I heard is that your mom may
or may not have killed a deer.

299
00:15:55,236 --> 00:16:00,471
Ugh. It's probably best I
start from the beginning.

300
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,515
Sir, I know this is
completely inappropriate

301
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:13,585
for a subordinate to ask her commander,

302
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:15,346
but are you okay?

303
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:21,234
Catherine and I are going
trough a rough patch.

304
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:25,047
Copy that, sir. My apologies.

305
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:28,187
I was under the impression it
had something to do with Alice.

306
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,399
It turns out it does.

307
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:33,702
Catherine paid the DNA analysts

308
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:36,748
to say the skull
fragments found were Beth's.

309
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:38,843
And they weren't?

310
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,307
And I just confirmed she was responsible

311
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:46,127
for the bomb on Loeb
Bridge targeting Alice.

312
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,070
Damn. So Kate was right this whole time.

313
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:50,740
We don't know what's right.

314
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:53,576
The only way to settle this
for good is to catch Alice,

315
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:59,231
run her DNA, and... and let
science tell us the truth.

316
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,667
Kate's signal stopped moving.

317
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,163
Looks like they're at
some place called Dusty's.

318
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:08,770
Mmm. So good. Sure you don't want to?

319
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:09,977
Why?

320
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,717
I think the beef is grass-fed.

321
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,313
Why was there a face in a sink?

322
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:16,903
- Oh, that.
- I'm serious, Alice.

323
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:19,217
You survive a crash, wash up on shore,

324
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,884
some Hannibal Lecter finds you,

325
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:24,054
keeps you as his prisoner.

326
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:26,281
Did he want to kill you,

327
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:29,402
skin you, what?

328
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:31,738
Well, I wasn't a prisoner.

329
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:33,741
Then what were you?

330
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:35,628
I was a friend.

331
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:40,534
Friend, I've learned, takes
on a different meaning,

332
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:42,198
depending on who you ask.

333
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:46,153
Socialization is essential
to one's development.

334
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:50,299
It's as important as
food, water, and shelter.

335
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:54,469
It allows one to
develop a sense of self,

336
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:57,212
a sense of purpose.

337
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:59,048
W-what is that?

338
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:01,985
Oh, a little experiment.

339
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:03,630
You see...

340
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:09,676
My dear son didn't get the opportunity

341
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:11,487
to develop a sense of purpose

342
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:14,554
because the world made him an outcast.

343
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:17,224
They called him a monster.

344
00:18:23,507 --> 00:18:26,233
He waited a very long time

345
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:28,331
for someone...

346
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:30,292
Like you.

347
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:32,573
I just want to go home.

348
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:35,146
This is your home now.

349
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:38,485
I want my dad.

350
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:40,396
Don't cry.

351
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:43,233
You'll get used to it here.

352
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:54,970
Dad! Dad! Daddy!

353
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:59,323
Little Johnny didn't have any friends,

354
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:01,160
and then I came along.

355
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:03,550
What was he using the skin for?

356
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:05,312
Experiments.

357
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:10,651
Trying to hide Mouse's
hideous face. Heh.

358
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:14,406
He thought if he could find
a way to make him look normal

359
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:18,726
the ridicule would end and
he'd live happily ever after.

360
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:28,361
So... ahem... the skin
at the... at the morgue,

361
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:30,614
what... what were you...

362
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:32,731
What am I what, Kate?

363
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,901
Go on. Speak up.

364
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:36,797
Uh...

365
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:43,515
Oh. Oh, no. Don't tell
me you're a lightweight.

366
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,344
What's wrong, dear sister?

367
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,806
What did you do to me?

368
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:06,742
Take cover now!

369
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,538
Come out, come out, Commander.

370
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,784
Dodgson.

371
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,586
There's a propane tank on the east.

372
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,274
I'll distract them.

373
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,925
Keep your asses on the ground.

374
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:58,451
Where's my daughter? Where is she?

375
00:20:58,454 --> 00:21:00,678
Which one?

376
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:02,406
What the hell happened to you?

377
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:04,225
You happened, Commander.

378
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:06,911
I joined the Crows
to make Gotham better,

379
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:09,207
but you divided it.

380
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,918
The city's not safe.
The wealthy are safe,

381
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,972
and you're too blind to see it

382
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:18,630
just like you were too blind
to see your own daughter.

383
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:24,035
Sir! Sir!

384
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:26,346
Sir, stop, sir!

385
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:27,682
Commander, come on.

386
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:29,961
Didn't have to be this way, Commander.

387
00:21:29,964 --> 00:21:31,797
You could have saved her.

388
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:43,681
Ooh!

389
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,448
Ooh.

390
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:52,403
I mean, God, Kate knew this whole time

391
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:54,010
that Beth was alive.

392
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,615
You know, that celestial sisterly bond

393
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:57,667
is real, man.

394
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,200
Actually, that's really heavy.

395
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:02,041
It just made me dizzy.

396
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:03,376
Let me call you a car.

397
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:04,754
To take me where?

398
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,142
The penthouse built on lies
of falsely dead children?

399
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:09,405
Hard pass.

400
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,020
Look. I get that you're
going through a lot right now,

401
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:13,697
but Kate is obviously not here,

402
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,952
and I'm really trying to work.

403
00:22:14,955 --> 00:22:17,033
Seriously, Luke, I am going

404
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,637
through a major family
crisis here, okay?

405
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,712
I don't even know who
my own mom is anymore.

406
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:25,692
I just found out I have
a second stepsister.

407
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:29,253
Kate found her actual full sister?

408
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:37,625
Oh, my God. Wait.

409
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:39,809
Is Kate with Alice right now?

410
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:41,615
If I say yes, will you leave?

411
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:43,398
Wow.

412
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:47,476
Here I am at the literal lowest point

413
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:50,425
that I've ever been, and
Kate decides to choose today

414
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:53,018
of all days to go out
for some sisterly bonding

415
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,096
with a coldblooded killer?

416
00:22:55,107 --> 00:23:01,060
Meanwhile, how many people
have I murdered, hmm?

417
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:02,521
- What?
- Guess!

418
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:05,275
How many people have I killed?

419
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:07,358
It's between zero and why are you even

420
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:08,827
hesitating right now?

421
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,822
Zero. I've killed zero people.

422
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,818
I'm the good sister.

423
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,641
You found the tracker, didn't you?

424
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:29,514
You knew I'd come for you.

425
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:31,851
Yes, I found the tracker. Heh.

426
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:33,346
I knew a few morgue thefts

427
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:35,303
would stir you into action,

428
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:37,961
arranged for a friend
to drug your drink,

429
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:44,135
and now I've taken you
out of the equation.

430
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:47,246
You see, my dearest Mouse and I

431
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:51,154
were cooking up a little
something special for Gotham,

432
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:53,445
and it'll undoubtedly
go down more smoothly

433
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,415
without a Bat in the broth.

434
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:57,783
Let me go, Alice.

435
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:01,830
But we haven't even gotten to
the best part of the story yet.

436
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:08,554
Alas after weeks and weeks in captivity,

437
00:24:08,556 --> 00:24:14,547
like a little rabbit
down a hole so small,

438
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:18,669
I... finally managed...

439
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:23,595
To claw... my way out.

440
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,812
It's curious, for there are

441
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:32,064
so many out-of-the-way things
that when one becomes desperate

442
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:33,508
present themselves.

443
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:36,006
I found one such opportunity

444
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:38,919
in a rusty, little friend.

445
00:24:38,922 --> 00:24:44,092
Oh, dear, oh, dear, my
poor, delicate fingers,

446
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:49,257
but success I eventually did make mine.

447
00:25:24,368 --> 00:25:26,706
- Hello.
- Daddy, it's me Beth.

448
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,583
- You have to help.
- Beth?

449
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:30,855
Oh, my God. Beth, where are you?

450
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:36,036
If anyone comes looking
for you, I will kill them...

451
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:40,843
And it will be all your fault.

452
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:42,874
Do you understand me?

453
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:52,576
I remember that call.

454
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:56,606
My first and last chance at freedom.

455
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,234
Dad had it traced.

456
00:26:01,237 --> 00:26:06,440
After all that time and there
were so many false leads,

457
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:08,976
the GCPD didn't believe us,

458
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:12,415
said they'd already searched
this area several times...

459
00:26:14,297 --> 00:26:16,556
But we were here within an hour.

460
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,368
You stay here.

461
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,578
- Where is she?
- Mr. Kane, there's been

462
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,248
- a terrible misunderstand...
- Where's my daughter?

463
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,588
Sir, please allow me to explain.

464
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,316
My daughter Beth called me not
one hour ago from this house.

465
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,943
She said, "Help," clear as can be.

466
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:38,487
It was all an insensitive prank.

467
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:41,549
I'm... I'm... I'm so embarrassed. I...

468
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:43,156
Mr. Kane, your daughter is not in there.

469
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:47,637
Beth! Beth! Beth!

470
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,724
Beth, you in here?

471
00:27:00,844 --> 00:27:05,064
Mr. Kane, like I said, it was my son.

472
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:09,750
He has... an ability, I guess you'd say,

473
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,305
for mimicry.

474
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:16,650
Johnny, please show him what you did.

475
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:18,408
I don't want to.

476
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:19,994
Show him what you did.

477
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:21,497
I said I don't want to.

478
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,142
Show him!

479
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:32,433
Hi, Daddy. It's me Beth.

480
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:34,493
I learned a new song on my cello

481
00:27:34,496 --> 00:27:37,132
that I can play on the
first night of Chanukah.

482
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:39,635
Here. Let me show you.

483
00:27:40,924 --> 00:27:43,008
That's impossible.

484
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:50,942
How do you know what
her voice sounds like?

485
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:55,230
He saw a home video
clip on the nightly news.

486
00:27:55,232 --> 00:27:58,101
He's been obsessed
with her disappearance

487
00:27:58,104 --> 00:28:00,030
since it happened.

488
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,722
If anyone comes looking
for you, I will kill them.

489
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:47,115
Beth?

490
00:29:37,156 --> 00:29:40,207
I was there.

491
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,070
He told me if I made a peep

492
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:47,532
that he'd kill you both,

493
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,744
so I just waited.

494
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:54,291
I waited for you to feel it,

495
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,812
to know,

496
00:29:56,815 --> 00:29:59,641
to sense,

497
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:03,257
but alas, nothing.

498
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:10,128
I guess what they say about twins

499
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:11,606
being connected,

500
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:15,270
that profound, soulful, magical tie

501
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:18,658
is just fantasy...

502
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:22,213
The thing you dream about

503
00:30:22,216 --> 00:30:25,759
before your hunger

504
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:27,845
wakes you up.

505
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:44,753
I've lost Kate's location, sir.

506
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:46,883
She must have turned off her phone.

507
00:30:51,668 --> 00:30:54,470
- Sir?
- I've been out here before.

508
00:30:54,473 --> 00:30:56,449
15 years ago.

509
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:01,188
Sir, what's happening?

510
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:02,583
I know where they are.

511
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:07,865
Hi, Kate. Me again.
Fifth time now actually.

512
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:11,107
Still got that big... showing

513
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,583
with that big buyer.

514
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:14,849
Urgent, real urgent, need
you to call me back ASAP.

515
00:31:14,852 --> 00:31:16,723
Hey, hey!

516
00:31:16,726 --> 00:31:18,160
Wow.

517
00:31:18,163 --> 00:31:19,694
What the hell is this?

518
00:31:19,697 --> 00:31:22,064
Okay.

519
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:24,383
Alice hit up 3 morgues last night,

520
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:26,373
stole flesh from a
bunch of dead bodies...

521
00:31:26,376 --> 00:31:28,296
Oh, my God. Alice is the Skin Pirate?

522
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:30,015
- Of course she is.
- I know, I know.

523
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:31,852
You've skinned zero corpses.

524
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,675
Well, I haven't.

525
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:38,350
Is it disgusting that this is making me

526
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:41,020
really hungry for pizza?

527
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:44,219
Yes, that is absolutely disgusting.

528
00:31:44,222 --> 00:31:46,406
Here. Check this out. Found something.

529
00:31:46,408 --> 00:31:49,242
Two weeks ago, a guy
named Jonathan Cartwright,

530
00:31:49,244 --> 00:31:51,411
who admitted to having a similar hobby

531
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:53,446
of stealing skin from dead people,

532
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:54,874
escaped in the Arkham breakout.

533
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:57,302
What Arkham breakout?

534
00:31:57,305 --> 00:32:01,580
There was a breakout... At Arkham.

535
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,590
Uh, pretty sure I would have heard

536
00:32:03,592 --> 00:32:04,852
about something like that.

537
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:07,729
Uh... but you didn't, so...

538
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:11,517
So... Arkham officials covered it up.

539
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,886
Comforting.

540
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,857
You think this creep has
something to do with Alice?

541
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,718
I think the timing feels
incredibly suspicious.

542
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:35,330
I got the front. You take the back.

543
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:52,288
Sir, a couple of shacks in the back.

544
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,383
- Checking them out.
- Copy that.

545
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:19,228
Hi, Daddy.

546
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:27,192
Where's Kate?

547
00:33:27,195 --> 00:33:28,954
"Where's Kate?"

548
00:33:31,496 --> 00:33:34,640
"Is Kate okay? Is Kate happy?

549
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:36,437
Is she sleeping enough?

550
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,945
"Has she done her homework,

551
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:40,093
seen a doctor, had enough to eat?"

552
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,566
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate!

553
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:44,829
I'm so sick of Kate!

554
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:47,305
What are you doing?

555
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:49,017
Where's Beth?

556
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,778
When was the last time you uttered
those words, Commander Crow?

557
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,822
Was it here?

558
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,449
Was it in this house?

559
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,785
Come on. Don't do this.

560
00:33:58,788 --> 00:33:59,993
Was it when I called you

561
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,052
and you didn't even believe it was me?

562
00:34:07,382 --> 00:34:10,866
Let's go outside. We'll talk.

563
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:14,913
You told your men to kill me.

564
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:16,725
Put down the knife.

565
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:18,603
Because you don't care.

566
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:20,476
You've never cared!

567
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:21,706
Put down the knife.

568
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:22,799
You gave up on me!

569
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:25,478
Beth, drop the damn knife!

570
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,414
"Beth."

571
00:34:31,855 --> 00:34:36,682
You... you said it.

572
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:48,861
Agh!

573
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:52,423
Unh.

574
00:35:03,957 --> 00:35:06,240
- Sophie.
- Kate.

575
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:08,963
Sophie, I'm in here.

576
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:10,641
Hurry.

577
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:12,930
Agh!

578
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:24,449
Hey. I need some... unh!

579
00:35:40,784 --> 00:35:42,753
What the hell?

580
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:49,341
Aah!

581
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:53,029
There's a guy in the
shed. His face, I...

582
00:35:53,032 --> 00:35:56,334
Shh. I know who he is.

583
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,623
Ugh!

584
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,393
Ohh!

585
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,740
Drop it!

586
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:18,305
You need to decide right now
what you care more about...

587
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:21,494
Revenge or Mouse.

588
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:28,021
I said drop it, or the
next one goes in his head.

589
00:36:28,024 --> 00:36:31,359
Two can play this game... Sister.

590
00:36:31,362 --> 00:36:34,037
We both know you don't have it in you.

591
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,849
But I do.

592
00:36:45,564 --> 00:36:48,512
I suppose killing Daddy
would be all too easy

593
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:50,399
and no fun at all.

594
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,399
Let us all walk out of here,

595
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:56,736
and no one has to die today.

596
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,416
Dad.

597
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:13,831
Kate... it's her.

598
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:15,834
It's Beth.

599
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:27,127
So it has been an experience,

600
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,041
but your chariot has arrived.

601
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:32,164
2015 hybrid hatchback,
power everything, 4.3 stars.

602
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,988
- I can take a hint.
- Wasn't really hinting.

603
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:37,022
Oh!

604
00:37:39,028 --> 00:37:42,020
If Kate calls, can you just...

605
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:45,909
Tell her that I'm sorry for everything?

606
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:48,695
- Sure.
- Maybe if I go kill someone

607
00:37:48,697 --> 00:37:50,773
she'll actually call me back.

608
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:52,868
Only one way to find out.

609
00:38:05,022 --> 00:38:07,714
I thought if I let Alice tell her story

610
00:38:07,716 --> 00:38:10,380
the puzzle would fit
together, but the pieces are

611
00:38:10,383 --> 00:38:16,222
grim, grotesque, inhuman,
and it's my fault.

612
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:18,558
I was there and didn't feel her.

613
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,167
I'm her twin, Bruce.

614
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,061
How am I supposed to
connect with her now

615
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:24,358
when I couldn't connect with her then?

616
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,969
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?

617
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:32,806
You know I hate hospitals.

618
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,869
What if I don't know my sister

619
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:36,634
well enough to save her?

620
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,755
What if nobody does?

621
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:47,253
Well, Alice may have
been forced to flee.

622
00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:51,426
In the end, she got the cheese.

623
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,972
You didn't visit me.

624
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:58,577
My dearest Mouse, we both know

625
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,737
if I'd shown up to Arkham

626
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,410
with a freshly baked pie I would have

627
00:39:01,412 --> 00:39:03,660
no sooner been locked in a cell myself.

628
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:05,955
- Heh.
- Heh.

629
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:09,501
But you felt me in your dreams?

630
00:39:09,504 --> 00:39:11,722
Every night.

631
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:15,690
"Twined in memory's mystic band."

632
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:28,212
Beth?

633
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:29,577
Go away.

634
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,297
I shouldn't have tricked
your dad and sister.

635
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,067
I'm sorry.

636
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,552
I want to go home.

637
00:39:36,555 --> 00:39:38,427
You know he won't let you.

638
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,079
But you can.

639
00:39:40,082 --> 00:39:41,637
You can let me out.

640
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,808
Maybe, but...

641
00:39:44,811 --> 00:39:47,367
I also don't want you to go.

642
00:39:49,278 --> 00:39:51,520
I want to be your friend.

643
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:58,960
To keep you company.

644
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:27,205
"Oh, Mouse,

645
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:30,742
do you know the way out of this pool?

646
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:35,703
I am very tired of
swimming in my own tears."

647
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:39,017
"I do know a way.

648
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:44,548
I will help you escape
your pool of tears."

649
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:46,984
And you did.

650
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:49,292
You saved me.

651
00:40:50,557 --> 00:40:52,783
I have a gift for you, too.

652
00:41:05,687 --> 00:41:07,478
I love you, Alice.

653
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:10,649
I love you, too, Dear Brother,

654
00:41:10,652 --> 00:41:13,040
and now that we are together again

655
00:41:13,043 --> 00:41:17,740
I can help you become
anyone you want to be,

656
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:21,562
and once we are done with Daddy,

657
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:24,625
he will never forget about me.

658
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:28,810
Never, ever again.

659
00:41:28,813 --> 00:41:32,031
Are we mad?

660
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:34,318
I'm afraid so.

661
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:36,236
Ha ha ha!

662
