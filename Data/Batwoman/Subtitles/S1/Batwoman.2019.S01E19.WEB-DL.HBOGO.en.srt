1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,600
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,880
What's so special
about Lucius Fox's journal?

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
It's a failsafe.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
To kill the Bat.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,760
No!

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,320
We can make you into anyone
you want to be.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,600
You want to be.
When do I get my face?

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,600
As soon as I get that journal.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Kate?

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
Reagan?

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
What do you mean it's gone?

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,480
I woke up and
Reagan was gone and...

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
And so was the book.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,160
The book filled with secrets
my dad died to protect.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,680
- I never thought Reagan...
- Guys!

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,760
The million-dollar question is what
would a bartender want with it?

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,520
You got your book.
Trade it for your freedom.

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,760
But I'm done being advance scout
for Magpie.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
How's my new favorite book?

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,120
Lucius Fox wrote the
entire journal in code!

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,120
Wait. Please. Don't...

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,200
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell?

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Hush.

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
Oh, my God!

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,040
Oh, my god.
I double-locked that.

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,280
- Where's the journal?
- How did you even find me?

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,960
You don't get to ask questions,
Reagan.

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
No more BS.

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,360
Tell me where the journal is
and I will get out of your life.

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,080
It wasn't all BS, Kate.

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,400
{\an5}Sorry I must have misinterpreted
the part where you slept with me

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
{\an5}to steal my property.

33
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,280
Yes, I stole it.

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,760
{\an5}And yes, I slept with you.
But it wasn't all...

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I still...

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,120
{\an5}I totally get why you hate me.

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,560
- Where's the journal?
- I don't know.

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,720
And that's the truth. I...

39
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,520
I gave it to someone.

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Who?

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,120
It will sound worse than it is.

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Who do you work for?

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
{\an5}It's more like "with."

44
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,960
{\an5}My sister, Margot.

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
{\an5}You know her...

46
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
{\an5}as Magpie.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,960
Magpie is your sister?

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Surprise.

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Why did she want it?

50
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
It bought her, her freedom out of
Arkham.

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,360
- Who did she give it to?
- I don't know.

52
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,760
I don't ask for details
for exactly this reason.

53
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,080
{\an5}Besides, by now it's lost up the food
chain, she's in the wind.

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,800
- I told all this to your friend.
- What?

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
What friend?

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,360
Blond chick. With the British accent.

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
She cornered me in a parking lot,
put a knife to my throat,

58
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,800
didn't stop to give a name.

59
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,040
{\an5}Good evening, Janet.

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,240
{\an5}I heard you had quite the
encounter with Abraham earlier.

61
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,760
{\an5}Well, they don't call it the mess
hall for nothing, Dr. Butler.

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Indeed.

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,000
{\an5}That was the wrong answer,
Professor Carr.

64
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,240
Try again.

65
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Is he done yet?

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,120
Does he look done yet?

67
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,760
I think this numeral is Aramaic.

68
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
This is Mayan.

69
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,280
These two letters could be
Babylonian.

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,840
I mean, if you want Kate dead so
badly,

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,280
why don't you just shoot her?

72
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,840
{\an5}I'm sure Tommy will give you
the friends-and-family rate.

73
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,960
{\an5}So, the last thing she sees
is his gauze pad and his gun,

74
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,840
{\an5}and has no idea what's happening.

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
No.

76
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,720
Her betrayal deserves a reckoning!

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
You see this, douchewad?

78
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,640
Not exactly the lady-killer
I used to be

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,760
{\an5}before that looney toon decided
to hold my new face hostage

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
{\an5}until you figure out
what the hell this books says

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,360
so glue a few brain cells together,

82
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,120
and decode it!

83
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,080
{\an5}This is extraordinarily complex.

84
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,920
My expertise is actually
numerical analysis, iterative...

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Please, please, just let me go!

86
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,920
I won't tell anyone I was here!
Please...

87
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Oopsie.

88
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,720
Looks like Professor Carr
ran out of gas.

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,920
You didn't even give him a chance.

90
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,960
- Can we move on to my plan now?
- No.

91
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,840
{\an5}We can't bring Luke Fox into this.

92
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,080
{\an5}His father designed the code.

93
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,200
{\an5}It doesn't take a cryptologist to
puzzle together he's our best choice.

94
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,120
{\an5}If we kidnap the kid,
we draw out the Bat.

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,680
It's already dangerous enough
bringing these other people.

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
{\an5}We found our Wonderland.

97
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,480
{\an5}Hot showers. Comfortable beds.
Three meals a day.

98
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,720
And we get to be together.

99
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,680
If we draw her out,
we could lose everything.

100
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,160
Tommy said that this book holds
the key to killing Batwoman.

101
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,000
{\an5}And I want her very, very dead.

102
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Having said that...

103
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,800
I hate to see you fret.

104
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,040
He's number one.
You have two strikes left.

105
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,160
{\an5}Now, put on your Dr. Butler face
and escort Tommy out the door.

106
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,600
<i>Good morning, Gotham.
Or should I say</i>

107
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,400
<i>"Good morning, Gotham"?</i>

108
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,440
<i>After a showdown in GU's library
last night,</i>

109
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,960
<i>the GCPD have coined
the bandage-wrapped gunslinger</i>

110
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,600
<i>after the only word
witnesses heard him utter,</i>

111
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
<i>"Hush."</i>

112
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,440
<i>Welcome to Gotham City, Hush.</i>

113
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,160
<i>Sounds like you're gonna fit
right in.</i>

114
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,600
What, you,
didn't think I'd find her?

115
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,880
Sorry, love, you caught me before my
latte.

116
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,160
Reagan said you came looking
for the journal.

117
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,160
Right. I did.

118
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,600
{\an5}Considering her little dine and dash

119
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,240
I figured I'd spare
you the humiliation.

120
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,760
- Did I do something wrong?
- Why did you want it?

121
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,840
- For you.
- You held a knife to her throat.

122
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,440
{\an5}Tell me you're not
defending the woman

123
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,640
{\an5}who lured you into bed
to pluck a book out

124
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,840
{\an5}from underneath your pillow.

125
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,280
Why didn't you just use your name?

126
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Tell her you're with the Crows?

127
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
{\an5}I see.

128
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,320
{\an5}Reagan can't be trusted
and now no one can be trusted.

129
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Not no one.

130
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,160
{\an5}Just people who've lied
to me in the past

131
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,880
{\an5}and last time I checked,
that includes you.

132
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Thanks.

133
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Kate, hey.

134
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,240
{\an5}Didn't expect to see you here.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
She was just leaving.

136
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,480
Commander called a briefing.
We should go.

137
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,080
Approximately 20 minutes ago,
one of our clients was kidnapped.

138
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,200
Tony Kim, 45, undercover NSA agent.

139
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,640
He was taken while reporting for work

140
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
at the field office
at Tricorner Yards.

141
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,400
In searching the area, their security

142
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,720
also discovered last
night's kidnapping victim,

143
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,600
Professor John Carr, dead,
in a dumpster.

144
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,120
Based on CCTV footage at Tricorner,

145
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,320
we can confirm Kim was abducted
by the same faceless perp

146
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,880
that took Carr from the university.

147
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,360
And apparently, the press has already
given him a nickname,

148
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Hush.

149
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,200
Let's find Agent Kim
and snuff this homicidal bastard out.

150
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,520
That doesn't make any sense.

151
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,440
Why would Julie want the book for
herself?

152
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
I don't know.

153
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,200
Why is Julia suddenly back in town,
working for my dad, dating my ex?

154
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,160
- She's not scheming against us.
- And you'd know that how?

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,840
Because she pretended
to fall in love with you?

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,520
When she was just a babysitter
sent by Bruce Wayne?

157
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,400
Okay, it's time to day drink.

158
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,960
Because I've known her
since we were kids.

159
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
She's legit.

160
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,600
So, you believe her over me?

161
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,600
Am I not allowed to disagree with
you now?

162
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,200
- Not when we're both being lied to.
- I trust her, Kate.

163
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,160
Then I can't trust your judgment.

164
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,200
Says the girl who went home
with a bartender

165
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,120
and left the key to
destroying Gotham out.

166
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Damn!

167
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,680
If you don't like how I do things,
no one's making you stay.

168
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
You know what?

169
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,600
You are absolutely right.

170
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,040
I have to find this damn book.

171
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,680
Which would be easier with Luke.

172
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,520
Because computers and stuff.

173
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,920
Okay, I gotta...

174
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,040
Gotham safety alert.
There's been another kidnapping.

175
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,360
They think it's the same guy
who hit up GU's library last night.

176
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,800
"NSA Data Analyst."

177
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
NSA?

178
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,760
Wait. Hang on.

179
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,480
In college, one of my friends
had Professor Carr.

180
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,160
At least until he had to have
an emergency heart surgery.

181
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,360
And apparently they got, like,
the hottest sub to replace him.

182
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
- The class became standing-room...
- Mary?

183
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,800
Sorry. Right.

184
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,280
I think...

185
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,440
Yup. Doctor Carr taught
Cryptography 1 and 2. Codes.

186
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,240
Just like the NSA.

187
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,320
Okay, Reagan said the journal looked

188
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
like it was written in
hundreds of languages,

189
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
like a cipher.

190
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,760
So, you think this Hush guy
is kidnapping codebreakers

191
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,320
because he has the journal?

192
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,960
Yeah.

193
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,160
If he gets one to break the code
before I find him...

194
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,880
Then the same monster
who shot up a library full of people

195
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,400
will know all about
the deadliest weapons in Gotham.

196
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,320
Agent Kim, hi.

197
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,840
I was hoping to employ your services.

198
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Hmm?

199
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
And to think...

200
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
He was hired to protect our country.

201
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,080
They need more than 90 minutes
to figure it out.

202
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,440
Alice, you keep killing them.

203
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,760
Well, they keep disappointing me.

204
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,040
You realize the more people we
abduct, the more we risk exposure.

205
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,720
And you realize none of this is real,
right?

206
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,040
You can play house and dress up

207
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,960
and pretend this funny farm
is your own private castle.

208
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,400
But at the end of the day,

209
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,800
you're just a freak
who made out with a radiator.

210
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,800
Enough! Boys.

211
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,920
You'll just have to find me someone
else.

212
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Every codebreaker in the city
is on lockdown because of him!

213
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,280
Well, there is one codebreaker
no one knows about.

214
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,560
You are such a dork.

215
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,600
You know, my mom is now obsessed
with that show, thanks to you.

216
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,240
<i>As she should be.
She understands cultural relevancy.</i>

217
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,360
My mom thinks culture is spaghetti
with...

218
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Oh, my God!

219
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Hush.

220
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,560
<i>Parker? What's up?</i>

221
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,560
According to <i>The Gazette</i>, Carr's body
was found covered in burn marks.

222
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
What does that mean?

223
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,920
It means poor Professor Carr.
Like he hadn't been through enough.

224
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,800
Right. You said he had heart surgery.

225
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,000
Any chance that surgery involved
getting a pacemaker?

226
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Hm.

227
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,560
Because a pacemaker
is totally traceable.

228
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Exactly.

229
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,480
So, we trace it back to where
it transmitted its last signal.

230
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,960
And then we'll know where he died,
and then we'll find Hush.

231
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
That's genius.

232
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,720
- Right.
- So...

233
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,880
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah. Right.

234
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
So, trace it.

235
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,840
- How?
- You don't know?

236
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Kind of a Luke thing.

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,920
- Maybe it's time to apologize?
- Wait, me?

238
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,040
You have a landline?

239
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Gotham Pride Real Estate.

240
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
<i>Is Kate Kane there?</i>

241
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,040
- Who is this?
<i>- My name's Gina,</i>

242
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,760
<i>I'm Parker Torres' girlfriend,
and she said she knew you.</i>

243
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,320
Okay, yup, hi.

244
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,480
<i>So, I don't know what happened,
we were FaceTiming</i>

245
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,760
<i>and then the phone started shaking
and then she screamed to call you,</i>

246
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,400
<i>but then it went dead
and the last place she showed up</i>

247
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,240
<i>on Find My Friends was in Somerset,
and now I'm freaking out.</i>

248
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,080
Who is Parker Torres?

249
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,920
So if you're scared to show your face
in Gotham, that's bad.

250
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,160
- Like what's under there?
- Shut up!

251
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,960
- Aren't you supposed to say, "Hush"?
- Shut up!

252
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,120
No offense,
but I've been kidnapped by worse.

253
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,880
I know if you haven't killed me yet,
it means you can't kill me.

254
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,520
Kate, this is Mary. Oh, wait,
are we allowed to use our real names?

255
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,680
It doesn't matter.
I'm in Somerset.

256
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,560
Okay.
There's a van going south

257
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,840
on the Williams Viaduct.

258
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,760
Just triggered
three speed-trap cams.

259
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,560
Probably him.
I'm heading north.

260
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,920
I don't know if that's a good idea.
Uh, let me zoom in real quick.

261
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,320
Come on, how do you...?
Is there a manual?

262
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,560
Oh...

263
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,360
Oh, okay. Hello? Can you still hear
me?

264
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,600
I think you're driving the wrong way
on a one-way.

265
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,640
Kate! You're going the wrong way!

266
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Batwoman.

267
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,960
Oh, Batty wants to be a hood
ornament.

268
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Come on.

269
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Hey!

270
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Oh...

271
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,480
Hello, Parker. Welcome.

272
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,640
Thank you for joining us.

273
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,920
I'm a teen. I have angst.

274
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
We get it, Alice.

275
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Do you?

276
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,040
Because you couldn't handle
a teenage schoolgirl.

277
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,200
Well, Batwoman showed.

278
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
I had to bail.

279
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,680
What do you mean, "Batwoman
showed"?

280
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,960
We're you followed?

281
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,320
I sort of stopped thinking clearly
when she threw a batarang in my leg!

282
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,040
Boys, boys.

283
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,280
All the more reason to want her dead.

284
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,080
Now, I have met disappointment...
thrice.

285
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,880
Are we finally ready...

286
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,960
to do things my way? Hm?

287
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,480
Gotta jet. We've got a possible Hush
sighting on the Williams Viaduct.

288
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,760
Got it.

289
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,000
- Uh, you go ahead, I'll meet up.
- Copy.

290
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Hey, you.

291
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
I love visits and all, but I'm sure
you're not supposed to be here.

292
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,000
That's funny.
Because I did a little digging,

293
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Julia,

294
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,240
and I'm pretty sure I can say
the same thing about you.

295
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,720
OMG!

296
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,440
Yeah, full disclosure?
I thought "Batcave" was metaphor.

297
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Are there like...?

298
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,960
Yep. Not a metaphor.

299
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,640
Uh... Hi.

300
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
I think you got off at the wrong
floor.

301
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,720
It's fine. This is Parker Torres.

302
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,880
KK and I go way back. And you're...?

303
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,360
Mary. Otherwise known as the last

304
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,320
person to find out
that Kate is Batwoman.

305
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Hush got away.

306
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,120
What do you mean, "Hush got away"?

307
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,080
He was our only lead since you've

308
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,200
refused to ask Luke how
to track a pacemaker.

309
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
I'm well aware, thank you.

310
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,800
Maybe you should kiss and make up
and get his butt back here.

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Who are you?

312
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,120
And then SRR found out I was doing a
spot of freelancing

313
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,800
for another party and...

314
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Well, they let me go.

315
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,480
A spot of freelancing
doesn't get you blacklisted

316
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,760
from the biggest intelligence agency
in the EU.

317
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,760
Who are you working for?

318
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,400
- Who wants my dad's journal?
- Luke, if I told you that,

319
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,400
we wouldn't be sitting here right
now.

320
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,720
- Hello?
- <i>Hey! Where are you?</i>

321
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,080
Wilson Plaza by Crow Headquarters.
What phone are you using?

322
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
<i>Stay there, I'll find you.</i>

323
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Okay.

324
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
Kate's on her way down.

325
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,480
So, are you gonna tell her or am I?

326
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,160
Ballistics matched these rounds
to the library crime scene.

327
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,560
Same .45 caliber pistol. It was Hush.

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And he wasn't alone.

329
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
We're lucky there wasn't much traffic
on that bridge

330
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,600
or we'd be bagging a lot more
than batarangs.

331
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,200
Sir.

332
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,360
I don't want to fight with you
about Batwoman's intentions.

333
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,920
My fight's not with you.

334
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,200
But I also don't want to wait and
find out which masked freak is gonna

335
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
get more people killed.

336
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,280
I'm bloody serious, Luke,
Kate can't know any of this.

337
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,840
I blew up on Kate in your defense
and she was right about everything.

338
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Not everything, okay? There's stuff
about Kate you don't know.

339
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Are you here already?

340
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,960
- <i>What are you talking about?</i>
- What do you mean, what am I ta...?

341
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Hush.

342
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,040
Welcome to Arkham.

343
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,960
You're going to decipher Daddy's
code,

344
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,680
or we will fry this little cutie...

345
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
like bacon.

346
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,920
There's no way.
My dad was a genius. Legitimately.

347
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,320
MENSA, 163 IQ, it would take a team
of codebreakers weeks,

348
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,520
months to crack this.

349
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,320
Well, sadly...

350
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,040
I don't think he's gonna give you
that long.

351
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,280
- <i>It's Luke...</i>
- Now he's not answering.

352
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,600
- Can you text him?
- I am, it's green.

353
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,760
I think his phone is off.

354
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,320
Something's up.

355
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,240
He might be mad at me,
but he wouldn't turn off his phone.

356
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Wait, is that him?

357
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
No, it's Sophie in the elevator.

358
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,680
Should I invite her down here?

359
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,440
Since apparently everyone else is
allowed?

360
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Good talk.

361
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Hmm.

362
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Sophie, hey.

363
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
You okay?

364
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,960
Honestly, trying to rein in a little
panic.

365
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,240
Not to make this awkward, or...

366
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
whatever...

367
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,960
But have you seen Julia? She's MIA.

368
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Who's the babe?

369
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,720
Way off limits. It's Kate's ex.

370
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,200
Of course, she is. And who's Julia?

371
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,720
Her other ex.

372
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,440
Okay. Move.

373
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,960
<i>I heard you two are hanging out.</i>

374
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Julia and me?

375
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,320
I... I guess you could say that.

376
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Is that...

377
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
okay?

378
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,320
- No, it's not okay.
- Oh, this is torture.

379
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,720
Because if it's not, I'll keep it
platonic.

380
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,840
Whatever makes you happy.

381
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,560
- No! Tell her you love her.
- Oh, shush, I can't hear.

382
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,560
If I hear from Julia, I'll tell her
to check in.

383
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Would you ask Luke too?

384
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,680
He was with her
before she went radio silent.

385
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Luke...

386
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Stop!

387
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,200
Stop! Stop! Stop, you're killing her!

388
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,200
Nope. Not yet. Still alive. For now.

389
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,240
You are a tough one, lass.

390
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Arkham's power bills
are gonna be through the roof.

391
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,480
But, just between me, you,
and, well, science...

392
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,040
I'm not sure how much more you can
take.

393
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,240
I've had worse.

394
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
Not yet.

395
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,080
But you will. If the human abacus
over here

396
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,880
doesn't show me how the
cipher works.

397
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,120
How do you expect me to concentrate?

398
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,440
You want me to figure this out,
give me some space.

399
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Indeed.

400
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Oh.

401
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,040
And show me your work, Mr. Fox.

402
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,600
Because if you're lying,
I'm going to turn blondie...

403
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
into a glowstick.

404
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
You can do this, right?

405
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
I don't know. I...

406
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,280
I need more brain power, I need...
I need more time. I need...

407
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,920
- I need my dad.
- Luke.

408
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,000
You are every bit as smart as your
father.

409
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,320
No, I'm not!

410
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,960
Okay? I, more than anybody, wish that
were true,

411
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,480
but I am not my father, okay?
I'm not even close.

412
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
And we're both going to die because
of it.

413
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,280
I don't understand
why we're keeping Tommy alive.

414
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,120
Because he spent the last decade

415
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,040
looking for ways to kill Batman.

416
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,000
He managed to steal the rail gun

417
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,080
from Wayne R&D before
my sister pilfered it.

418
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,680
Maybe he'll know where we can find

419
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,680
whatever weapon we glean from this
journal.

420
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,960
And then we'll kill him.

421
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,440
Off to group therapy.

422
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,400
Mr. Calderone is right on the
verge of a real breakthrough.

423
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Go get them, doc.

424
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Heh, heh.

425
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,240
Of course, Hush took Luke,
his dad wrote the journals.

426
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
Anything?

427
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,880
I can't get a ping on either of
their phones.

428
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,000
What about running a trace on
Professor Carr's pacemaker.

429
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,840
- Yeah, maybe but not from this.
- How about that?

430
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,360
That looks older than my mom.

431
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,720
Sure you don't have anything
more modern, like a sundial?

432
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,080
Sorry, why does this rando teen get
to know that you're, Batwoman.

433
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,440
Let me see what I can do.

434
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,640
Julia.

435
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,840
It's a polyalphabetic cipher.

436
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Okay.

437
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,680
That's a start.

438
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,640
- How many letters are in it?
- Hundreds.

439
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,080
Hundreds in multiple languages
and alphabets.

440
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,120
Well, can you work out the sequence?

441
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,520
So far, I got A corresponds
with Heth,

442
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,200
the first letter
of the Aramaic alphabet,

443
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,800
which is alphabetically the first
other alphabet my Daddy used.

444
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,120
B takes us to the Babylonian
alphabet, the next, alphabetically.

445
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,360
That's bloody brilliant.

446
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,760
Can't you slide one letter at a time?

447
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,920
No, I... I tried that.

448
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,480
That would be way too easy for my
Dad.

449
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,960
There's an interval variance
each time

450
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,280
he switches to a new alphabet.

451
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,360
Now, if l could figure out
the number sequence for the integrals

452
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,240
then I'd have the key to decrypt
this.

453
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,440
That leaves us ten minutes to work
out a few billion

454
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,080
random number sequences.

455
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,280
Except my Dad was meticulous.

456
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,400
It would never be random.

457
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,000
It'd be personal to him.

458
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,120
Or personal to me.

459
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,040
Okay. The first slide's five,
the second slide's three.

460
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,200
The third, five...

461
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,920
He used my social security number.

462
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,560
- Okay, no pressure...
- That's what people say

463
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,640
to pressure someone.

464
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,920
It's just that we're running
out of time.

465
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,280
I'm in.

466
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,240
Manufacturer's database says
there are three John Carrs

467
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,400
with pacemakers.

468
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,400
- Do you have their locations?
- Not yet,

469
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,440
but if I'm not careful, I could kill
the two John Carrs that aren't dead.

470
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,000
So, yeah, no pressure.

471
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,920
Anything I can do to help?

472
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,200
Can you bypass the data throttling,
get me more speed out of this heap?

473
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,920
Nope.

474
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,920
Then I'll settle for you not
distracting me.

475
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,000
Oh, how cute was baby Luke?

476
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,720
Hey, Mr. Fox.

477
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,280
Your frames are on point.

478
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Glasses.

479
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,000
It's the glasses.

480
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,240
They can translate the journals, try.

481
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,120
The journals need these
to decode them.

482
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,440
You did it.

483
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,920
Didn't you?

484
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,160
You know what it says?

485
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Yeah.

486
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,880
Why aren't you happier about this?

487
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,080
You did it!

488
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
What does it say?

489
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,080
Something that I can't tell anyone.

490
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,760
Most of all, Gotham's
least mentally stable villain.

491
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
I'm sorry.

492
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,640
Time's up. Pencils down. Now...

493
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,560
Read to me
from my new favorite bedtime story.

494
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,920
We're not telling you.

495
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,560
Does she speak for both of you or...?

496
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,440
My father was willing to die for this
secret.

497
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,840
And we're willing to do the same.

498
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,280
Okay, two of the John Carr pacemakers
are still active

499
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,960
and the third stopped working...

500
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,800
Here. Professor Carr's heart beat
for the last time at...

501
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,160
- No.
- Is that Arkham?

502
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,360
Alice is behind this somehow.

503
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,000
Reagan stole the journal
to get Magpie out of Arkham.

504
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,360
That's who she bought
her freedom from.

505
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,040
Not to state the obvious,
but Alice is an inmate.

506
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,240
She's also Alice. Being
captive is a way of life for her.

507
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,240
You know how Carr
had burn marks on his body?

508
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Yeah.

509
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,920
I think I know
how she's torturing her victims.

510
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
How?

511
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,720
Oh, she usually doesn't tell
us what she's thinking.

512
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,160
So cool.

513
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,880
Hey, stop right there!

514
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,800
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

515
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,200
Sorry, guys, I didn't wanna do that.

516
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,080
<i>By not having the right
tool. Can I get an "Amen"?</i>

517
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,840
<i>That's right, and when it comes to
drill bits, I'm the...</i>

518
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,720
<i>Delta 1566, give me a call on...</i>

519
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,120
Batwoman just took out
a pair of guards at Arkham.

520
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,160
We're still rounding up perps
from the last breakout.

521
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,680
I want all available teams
getting a handle on this now!

522
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,160
- I can do this all day.
- Oh...

523
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,560
She's so strong.

524
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Toasty.

525
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,840
Now, tell me what daddy had to say.

526
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,600
Do you not get it, Alice?

527
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,920
You are the reason
there's a code in the first place.

528
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And you're the reason
Alfie Pennyworth has to go...

529
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,320
casket shopping.

530
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,880
Let them go.

531
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,760
I'm sorry, who are you?

532
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,000
All the torture therapy I've endured
has messed with the old noggin.

533
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,280
I said let them go.

534
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,000
Oh...

535
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,120
Batty...

536
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,240
You're outnumbered and sadly,
we don't do demands.

537
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,640
I'm not demanding, I'm trading.

538
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,760
These are Lucius Fox's glasses.
They unlock the code.

539
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
No.

540
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,960
Let Luke and Julia go
and they're yours.

541
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,080
- You cannot do this.
- If l don't, she'll kill you.

542
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,280
And she'll kill you!

543
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,360
The book doesn't contain
Bat-weapon designs.

544
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,320
It contains the secret to killing
you.

545
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,240
My offer stands.

546
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,800
Let them go.

547
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,320
Take these stairs to the bottom.

548
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,480
You'll find a hatch in the floor
to the tunnels.

549
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,400
- Get her out of here.
- Where you going?

550
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,360
To stop Alice and get the book back.

551
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,640
Hey!

552
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,320
Batwoman's in Cell Block D.

553
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,000
What did they do now?

554
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,440
Oh, we gotta get out of this place.
Our cover's blown.

555
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,760
Get the van, pull to the side lot,
by the air vents. We'll find you.

556
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,240
Alice, you gotta get back to your
cell now. Hey...

557
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,400
What are you doing?

558
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,240
No. No, no...

559
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,240
It was all very well and good while
it lasted, my dear Mouse.

560
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,880
Please, don't.

561
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,200
Yeah. Yeah.

562
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
Nice.

563
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,160
- Free.
- Come on,

564
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,440
we're headed to the main roof.

565
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
No!

566
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Alice!

567
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Help me!

568
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
This doesn't matter.

569
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,560
It does matter. We built a life for
us here.

570
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,880
It's over, Mouse.

571
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
We've been exposed.

572
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,040
- No!
- Let's go, tunnels now.

573
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Get out, now.

574
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,200
Sir, we were too late.
It's World War III in there.

575
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,000
Lock it all down.

576
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,480
And find me the Bat.

577
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Hey.

578
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,440
I thought you went home.

579
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,080
Let me just say something real quick.

580
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,120
You messed up today, okay?
I'm not worth the death of Batwoman.

581
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,160
I'm not worth seeing hundreds
upon thousands of citizens lose hope

582
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,720
as a result of whatever insane plan
Alice is formulating.

583
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,760
I am not worth all the lives that
could've...

584
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,400
We both know there's no Batwoman
without Luke Fox.

585
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,840
I was lost without you today.

586
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,880
- Good.
- Sorry. Hi.

587
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,840
I'm... Where... What...?

588
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,320
I am gonna go.

589
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Thank you for your help today.

590
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,440
Not that you're gonna take advice
from a rando teen, but...

591
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Sophie?

592
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,120
Maybe fight a little harder.

593
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
We'll see.

594
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,280
I was gone for five hours.

595
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Yeah.

596
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
What's the damage?

597
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,000
Well, my left hand's numb.
Some nerve damage in my arm.

598
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,960
Medic thinks I'll heal eventually.

599
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Or sooner.

600
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,400
- I'm glad you're okay.
- Me too.

601
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Kate.

602
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,760
Looks like a bad time.

603
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
Hey.

604
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
I'm gonna go.

605
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Luke told me everything.

606
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,400
He couldn't have told you everything
because he doesn't know everything.

607
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,600
I know you're lying about why you're

608
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,200
after a book that describes how to
kill me.

609
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,880
The Rifle showed up in Gotham

610
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,400
to assassinate you several months
ago.

611
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,600
I helped thwart him and he
disappeared.

612
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,800
Ever wonder why he never came back?

613
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,080
Because I followed him to his boss

614
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,480
and made a deal with her to stop
pursuing you.

615
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,840
In exchange for your life,
I'd fetch her the journal

616
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,400
and we'd both be on our merry way.

617
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,360
If she had the journal, she could
kill me.

618
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
She played me.

619
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,080
I didn't know what the journal
entailed till today.

620
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,800
Now that I do,
the deal's off.

621
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
Who is she?

622
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Safiyah Sohail.

623
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,360
- I've never heard of her.
- Well, she's heard of you, love.

624
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,760
And now that I've double-crossed her,
we've both got targets on our backs.

625
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
How's Arkham?

626
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
It's a mess.

627
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,960
Psychotic escapees are all over this
city right now, thanks to you.

628
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,800
Thanks to Alice.
She had the entire asylum in...

629
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,320
Alice isn't the one claiming
to be the city's hero.

630
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,520
She needs you as much as
you need her.

631
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,720
The Joker had Batman like she has
you,

632
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,080
and guess who always ends up
as collateral damage?

633
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,080
I will protect my city.

634
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
No, you won't.

635
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,040
Because you're done. Get out.

636
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,520
You know I won't leave.

637
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,040
Let this serve as your warning.

638
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,480
If I see you again...

639
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,800
it's war.

640
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,040
This isn't a shelter,
Alice, this is...

641
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,160
back to where we started.

642
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,560
No one's forcing you to stay.

643
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,840
I told you that inviting Luke
into your obsession

644
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,640
would draw out
the Bat.

645
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,400
And now, here we are,
freezing, wet,...

646
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,480
drenched in sewer water!

647
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,920
And I told you that Luke would bring
us the answers that we need,

648
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,200
so I suppose we're both right.

649
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,320
I was happy, Alice.

650
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I was happy.

651
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
What happened to you?

652
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,200
Do you ever care
that you burned the whole thing down?

653
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
I care...

654
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,880
about killing the Bat.

655
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,360
So, go bring me
that walking facial gone wrong

656
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,160
so he can tell me
where to find a little green rock...

657
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,040
Called kryptonite.
