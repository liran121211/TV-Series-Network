1
00:00:00,692 --> 00:00:02,615
Previously on "Batwoman"...

2
00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:04,336
- So you're into me.
- You would know.

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:06,431
- I'll call you then.
- I'd like that.

4
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:08,456
Bruce never stopped looking

5
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:09,508
for your sister's body.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,803
Guy had the best tech on the planet.

7
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:13,163
Why didn't he find her?

8
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,347
I think Alice is Beth.

9
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,795
I thought they found her body.

10
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,187
They found bone fragments.

11
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,592
Skull fragments matching Beth's DNA.

12
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:20,853
She's your daughter!

13
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,054
King of the Crows

14
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,361
can't even protect your own nest.

15
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:25,695
How'd you get in my house?

16
00:00:25,698 --> 00:00:27,166
You're making this personal, Alice.

17
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:29,154
It is personal!

18
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:30,202
What the hell do you want?

19
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:33,002
You're gonna tell me
everything you know about Alice.

20
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:34,792
You're not Batman.

21
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:36,270
That's the point.

22
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,656
Shiny, shiny.

24
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:23,297
Keep your Tiffanys close

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,326
and your Mikimoto closer, Gotham.

26
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:28,954
Last night marks the third
bling theft in a week,

27
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:31,559
this time nearly killing
a guard in the process.

28
00:01:31,562 --> 00:01:34,321
Well, today, everyone is
asking "Where was Batwoman?"

29
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:36,733
Hot off the heels of her citywide début,

30
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:38,685
and she's a no-show.

31
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:40,721
Seriously, was she curling her hair,

32
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:43,602
overcome by the myriad
of red lipstick shades,

33
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,423
going through a breaku...

34
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,272
Thank you.

35
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,925
Going through a breakup?

36
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:51,681
That woman literally risked
her life protecting this city.

37
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,371
Well, I heard she's doing Batman.

38
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:54,897
- Oh, you heard?
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,982
From who... Killer Croc?

40
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,965
I kind of like her actually.

41
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:01,069
Gotham could use a woman's touch.

42
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:03,223
Um, so you're into redheads now?

43
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:06,968
No, not at this exact moment.

44
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:26,444
I hate whoever that is.

45
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,821
_

46
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:34,702
Oh. Sorry. It's my... my,
um... my friend type thing.

47
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:39,692
Uh, girlfriend? Because that's
what that just sounded like.

48
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:41,672
No. It's a guy friend, a co-worker.

49
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:43,099
We... we share an office space.

50
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:47,824
The, uh... water main broke.

51
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:50,561
That sounds really serious.

52
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:54,081
I know. Yeah. I should probably go.

53
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,938
You come over super late,

54
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:57,938
you leave before breakfast.

55
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:01,797
I feel like I could date
you and start a new hobby.

56
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:04,108
I'll make it up to you.

57
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,597
Okay. I have to go. I have to go.

58
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,432
- Ha ha ha!
- Stay dry.

59
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:14,327
I have to go.

60
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,292
A wise woman once said,

61
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:22,868
"Hurt me with the truth.

62
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,821
Don't comfort me with a lie."

63
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:29,542
Yes, Bruce. I'm quoting Rihanna

64
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,414
because I'm not a liar.

65
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,422
I have never hidden who I am.

66
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:36,206
I came out when Brad Morrison
told all the kids at school

67
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,050
that I was gay.

68
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:41,996
I said, "Yeah, and?" Then punched him.

69
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,438
Ever since then, I've been out and proud

70
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,898
as long as I can remember,

71
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,859
so how the hell am I supposed to wake up

72
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,636
every morning and hide who I am?

73
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:51,596
That is brilliant,

74
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,232
uh, but do watch the glare, Margot.

75
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,686
Can I get a bounce card?

76
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:56,894
Hey. Want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

77
00:03:56,897 --> 00:03:58,304
You must be Roxanna.

78
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:00,830
Such a pleasure, Miss Kane.

79
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,845
The museum of antiquities is so grateful

80
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:05,044
you're lending us
Martha Wayne's necklace.

81
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:07,246
We cannot think of a better showpiece

82
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:08,822
to represent strong women

83
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:10,341
and pillars of their community.

84
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:13,085
She always loved your museum.

85
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,361
Margot, is that the last lens change?

86
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:17,742
- Yes.
- Shall we get a few mores shots?

87
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:20,292
And then we can get
out of miss Kane's hair.

88
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:23,938
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

89
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,196
I'm seeing someone.

90
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,216
You... okay.

91
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:31,437
So while you've been...

92
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,575
That, Magpie struck again.

93
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:37,261
She nuked a place last night,

94
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:38,992
nearly killed a security guard.

95
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:42,781
The vine work is so, uh, earth chic.

96
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,465
It's a work in progress.

97
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,730
Well, with that giant
Wayne sign on the building,

98
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,452
I'm sure whatever it is
will make Gotham proud.

99
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,698
- No pressure, right?
- I'll have our security team

100
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:53,056
bring the necklace
to the event tomorrow.

101
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:56,554
Smart. With everything that's
been happening around the city,

102
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:59,140
you can never be too careful.

103
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:05,062
So that is not why I called.

104
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:07,188
So your pet Dodgson,
not looking too good

105
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,924
and probably no smelling great.

106
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,309
What are we doing here?

107
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,054
He hangs out until he tells us

108
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:15,063
Alice's grand plan.

109
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,120
- Or he dies.
- He's just dehydrated.

110
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:18,600
- He's septic.
- Were you this annoying

111
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:21,205
when Batman took people prisoner?

112
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,230
I didn't think so.

113
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,547
Yeah. He needs an E.R.

114
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:14,614
Does your husband know
what's in plot 283, Catherine?

115
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:17,468
Shh. Your driver's gone nighty-night.

116
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,837
He's on a benzo break.

117
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,581
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,667
Heh. The great existential question.

119
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:28,295
What are we all doing here?

120
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:30,554
You know the thing I
love about bad guys?

121
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,817
Is that despite ourselves we are all so

122
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,681
tragically predictable.

123
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:37,125
Of course, you'd follow the cards I left

124
00:06:37,128 --> 00:06:40,670
right back there to cover your tracks.

125
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:43,727
What do you want?

126
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,238
Hmm. To keep this to myself,

127
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,817
and in return, you are
gonna give me something,

128
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,817
a very powerful toy.

129
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,040
I understand that Hamilton
Dynamics is developing

130
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,202
a very "top-secret" weapon.

131
00:07:00,204 --> 00:07:01,772
I own one of the largest

132
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:03,479
defense companies in the country.

133
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:06,505
I'm hardly privy to its
day-to-day project management side.

134
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:09,428
Oh, but you are. You are the priviest

135
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,024
because this particular
project was your idea.

136
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:16,435
How do you know that?

137
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,806
Well, I spent in an hour
in your house, Catherine.

138
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:21,497
What did you think... I was just
poking around your shoe closet?

139
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,535
Which should be its
own monument by the way.

140
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:30,616
Yeah. You are gonna give it
to me by 10 p.m. tomorrow,

141
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:33,700
or Commander Kane will
know that you're the one

142
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,833
who convinced him his
dear, darling daughter

143
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:39,595
was dead.

144
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,688
Oh, my God!

145
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:59,570
Oh, my God! Hi! You're Batwoman!

146
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:03,431
Mary Hamilton. Huge fan

147
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,773
but not in, like, an annoying way.

148
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,245
Can I just say welcome to
Gotham, and you know what?

149
00:08:08,247 --> 00:08:09,613
Screw the haters.

150
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,156
I once wore this jumpsuit,

151
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,649
and it was bordering on last season...

152
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:14,221
I need your help.

153
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:15,762
I heard you're discreet.

154
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:17,949
Okay. Yeah. Anything.

155
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:25,191
Oh. Okay. So he actually
just tried to kill me,

156
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:29,545
so... that's not me saying no.

157
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:32,766
It's just slightly more complicated.

158
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:33,996
Why do you have him?

159
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:36,440
I need to know what Alice is planning.

160
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,750
This is grossly infected.

161
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:48,599
You don't have any
neosporin in your batbelt?

162
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:50,153
Can you save him?

163
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,530
I can try

164
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,958
because I actually subscribe to a code.

165
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,943
It's called do no harm.

166
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:58,412
I'll be back for him.

167
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,339
We'll be here.

168
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:04,284
Hopefully alive.

169
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:07,641
If I wanted to be a
beacon of hope to Gotham,

170
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:10,481
I needed to show them that I was there.

171
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:13,076
I had to restore their
confidence in the Bat,

172
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,754
and to do that, I
needed to catch Gotham's

173
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,005
most dangerous thief.

174
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:18,357
Batcave to Batwoman.

175
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:20,322
How long have you waited to say that?

176
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,441
Honestly, it just came to
me two seconds ago, so...

177
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:24,094
- What do you want?
- I've been thinking

178
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,139
why is this Magpie
Woman so hard to track?

179
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:27,576
You know, police can't find her,

180
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:29,116
she's one step ahead of the Crows.

181
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,360
No trace of her on
any city surveillance,

182
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,773
and then it occurred to me...

183
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:34,543
Everyone's looking for a woman

184
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:38,285
when we should be looking for a bird.

185
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,254
Eagle cams.

186
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,761
Do we have to be on opposite sides?

187
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:11,151
Birds of a feather
should flock together.

188
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,871
I'm allergic to feathers.

189
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:19,618
An egg? Really committed to this

190
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,953
whole bird thing, aren't you?

191
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,422
Really think it's worth that?

192
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,072
Maybe not to you, but to me,

193
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,457
it's food, a roof over my head,

194
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,784
and a modicum of dignity.

195
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,716
Batarang? More like Batawhiff.

196
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:51,217
According to the
gallery security footage,

197
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,569
last night our lady
crusader missed the return

198
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,487
on her not-so-trusty Batarang

199
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,616
and caused some major
damage to a gilded vase

200
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:02,564
that once belonged to Marie Antoinette,

201
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:05,492
and we thought Magpie
was a threat to this city.

202
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:07,820
Talk to me, Gotham.
Do we need to take out

203
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:10,249
an insurance policy on our new hero?

204
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,327
You probably miscalculated the position.

205
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,664
- I didn't.
- Maybe you angled it wrong.

206
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,240
- Maybe it's broken.
- It's not broken.

207
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:16,360
If it worked, I would have caught it.

208
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:17,612
Did you try flipping your wrist back...

209
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,164
You're Batsplaining. I already have

210
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,203
the whole city on my ass.

211
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:22,008
I do not need you joining in the chorus.

212
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,610
Well, good news, bad news.

213
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:26,496
I figured out what you ripped
off Magpie's belt last night...

214
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:28,164
Grenades.

215
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,758
Yeah, cute but no less deadly.

216
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,505
Concussion or fragmentation?

217
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:34,155
Probably an M-67 filled
with TNT or gunpowder.

218
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:35,934
I'll know more after I
run a chemical analysis.

219
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,299
It could help us track down Magpie.

220
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,501
How long will that take?

221
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:40,527
Depending on the complexity
of the deformulation...

222
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:42,053
Hour and a half.

223
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:43,888
Great. I'll see you then.

224
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,556
Wait. Where you going?

225
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:47,609
I owe someone a lunch.

226
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:50,522
Someone. A date. Cool.
Yeah. No. I'll be here,

227
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:52,433
not dating anyone
because I love to work.

228
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:56,451
Love to work. This is great. Have fun.

229
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:11,633
Pretty song.

230
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:13,717
Alice was playing it when she broke

231
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,984
into the penthouse the other night.

232
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:18,291
Alice plays the cello?

233
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:23,113
That's so... on brand.

234
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:25,813
Beth played the cello.

235
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:28,727
This was her favorite piece.

236
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,237
Do you think...

237
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,764
What'd you bring me?

238
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:35,256
Ahem. The report detailing the bomb

239
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:37,692
that blew up Alice's transport van.

240
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:40,570
I thought you'd want to
see it before anyone else.

241
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:44,866
It's an IED using high
standard components.

242
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:46,668
The convoy had 7 vehicles.

243
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,945
It hit Alice's van
with a 99.9% accuracy.

244
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:52,520
Bomb probably used an
advanced sensor initiation

245
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:55,710
to detect its target.

246
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:58,177
A sensor with that level of detection

247
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,781
is unreleased technology
unique to Hamilton Dynamics.

248
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,283
What are you saying?

249
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,512
Bomb's one of ours?

250
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:13,787
Why would someone at Hamilton
want to ambush the convoy?

251
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:18,865
You were living with polar bears

252
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:21,110
under the borealis, no rent, no traffic,

253
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:24,245
no getting mugged in
line grabbing a coffee.

254
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:26,633
Why the hell did you move back here?

255
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:29,320
- Long story.
- So an ex-girlfriend.

256
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:32,455
- Wow.
- Told you I could read people.

257
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:34,624
Her name is Sophie,
and she's in the past,

258
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:36,261
and according to her, we never even had

259
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:37,822
a past, so there's that.

260
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:41,246
You came home for your ex
who doesn't see you as an ex?

261
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:43,883
Sounds like I have
nothing to worry about.

262
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:47,303
Why am I talking about her?

263
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:48,922
I used to live there.

264
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:52,180
Before it was that, it was a
small, charming 10-unit place full

265
00:13:52,183 --> 00:13:54,642
of sweet, neighborly,
hard-working people,

266
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:58,147
who all got exiled to parts of
the city that no one cared about.

267
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,220
Meanwhile, all the
predatory real estate moguls

268
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:04,345
who don't give a crap about
the lives they're uprooting

269
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:05,730
get rich.

270
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:08,334
You were literally evicted
from your childhood.

271
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:09,778
That's awful.

272
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:12,678
Not that I wanted to live
in a Crows district anyway.

273
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:15,373
- No offense.
- You googled me.

274
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,575
Of course I did.

275
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:19,352
No one's allowed to
have secrets anymore.

276
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:21,805
So does that mean you will tell me

277
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:23,102
where we're going for lunch?

278
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:25,906
It does. My mom taught English
to the woman who owns the place.

279
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:29,029
She's supercute and has
the best tofu paneer.

280
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:30,864
I think you're gonna like it.

281
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,130
_

282
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:38,729
Another plumbing emergency?

283
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:43,317
Uh, electrical fire in
the... ventilation system.

284
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:45,879
That sounds like a real mess.

285
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:48,289
What is that you do again?

286
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,909
Nothing really. Just keeping
tabs on my cousin's building.

287
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:54,387
Not so good at it, huh?

288
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,854
There's a fundraiser later
at the antiquities museum.

289
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,315
You want to be my date?

290
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:02,377
Um... maybe.

291
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,882
Come on. 9:30. No emergencies.

292
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:07,567
Please, please, please, please.

293
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:09,802
Okay. Holding you to it.

294
00:15:09,804 --> 00:15:11,738
9:30.

295
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,659
Oh. You got to be kidding me.

296
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:53,455
Hmm.

297
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,080
Ow. Come on.

298
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:01,957
She stole the necklace.

299
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,084
She took it by feathers and force.

300
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:07,921
I'll let the museum know
they're losing their showpiece.

301
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:11,545
Bruce's mom was killed
for that necklace.

302
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:13,443
Yeah.

303
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:17,097
He spent years looking
for it in the streets,

304
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:18,828
finally found it in an auction,

305
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:22,936
and spent $1 million buying it back.

306
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:25,698
I should have been here.

307
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,935
I have to get it back.
Any leads on the bomb?

308
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:31,881
Actually, yeah. Magpie 3-D printed them.

309
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:34,781
- That's new.
- Yeah, I know.

310
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:36,968
Nanothermites via inkjet.

311
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,785
- Explosive ink?
- It's regulated.

312
00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:39,962
Only a few companies sell it.

313
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:41,474
Then we find everyone that it's sold to.

314
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:43,957
Well, you now, the Crows
do track munition shipments

315
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,201
in and out of the city.

316
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:46,960
You could ask your girl
Sophie if she can get

317
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,529
a list of who's buying exploding ink.

318
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:51,589
It's bad timing.

319
00:16:51,592 --> 00:16:53,675
Bad timing,

320
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:56,259
a bomber loose in Gotham.

321
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:58,071
I...

322
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:02,293
Exploding ink. That's specific.

323
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:05,354
Magpie used one to
break into Wayne Tower.

324
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:07,164
She take anything?

325
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,500
My aunt Martha's pearl necklace.

326
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:12,837
Damn. Does your dad know?

327
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:17,074
Copy.

328
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:21,123
Heard the Bat had a run-in
with her the other night.

329
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:25,218
The Bat? I thought they were
calling her Batwoman now.

330
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:26,392
Is that official?

331
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:29,131
I think so. It's catchy, mature.

332
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:33,632
Mm-hmm. So if she's on
the case, why are you?

333
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:37,695
You know why. I don't trust vigilantes.

334
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:42,858
Heh. How's the search going?

335
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:46,929
Just texted it to you.

336
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:48,647
Everyone within a 100-mile radius

337
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:51,500
who recently purchased explosive ink.

338
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:56,355
I really appreciate it.

339
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:59,500
I'm glad you came to me.

340
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:03,545
I know things between us
have been a little tense,

341
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:06,223
but we always make a good team.

342
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:13,606
I have to go.

343
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,020
Unh!

344
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,591
So clever of Catherine to send you boys

345
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:59,610
to find my cozy burrow,

346
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:01,612
but you're not the only ones

347
00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:03,522
with ears all around this city.

348
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:06,859
When you start asking
about our location,

349
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,953
it gets back to me.

350
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:13,982
Desperate, desperate
Catherine Hamilton-Kane

351
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:17,795
sending her goons to clean up her mess.

352
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:21,639
Perhaps she needs a little reminder

353
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:26,161
that I'm not playing games!

354
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:29,432
Who wants to help me
send her a message, hmm?

355
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,393
Hmm?

356
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,780
Eeny, meeny,

357
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,825
miny,

358
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,803
moe.

359
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:51,478
- You.
- It was him.

360
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,739
You pointed at him.

361
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:57,651
Like I said, I'm not playing a game.

362
00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:59,944
There are no rules.

363
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,224
Uh, another construction firm,

364
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:22,021
fireworks manufacturer,
gold mining company.

365
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,718
Wait. This shipment
doesn't have a destination.

366
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,759
Can you key the address?

367
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:26,854
Yeah. Let me check.

368
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:29,975
Sophie thinks I'm the Bat.

369
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:33,445
- How?
- Because I suck at hiding it.

370
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:37,732
How did Bruce make living
a double life look so easy?

371
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:40,119
Oh, he didn't. He was miserable.

372
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:41,453
Bruce Wayne? Guy had 3 Ferraris

373
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:42,955
and slept with half of Gotham.

374
00:20:42,957 --> 00:20:44,498
The playboy thing gave him a cover.

375
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,409
Different women meant he could
tell the same lies easily, but

376
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:48,577
sucked for him, too.

377
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,257
Honestly, in those last few months,

378
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,757
I think being Batman was
easier for him than being Bruce.

379
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,042
So the address is a P.O. box.

380
00:20:56,044 --> 00:20:58,354
You can send explosives to a P.O. box?

381
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,689
If you don't want to get caught.

382
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:05,811
I just got to the old Gotham hotel,

383
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:09,031
the address linked to
the P.O. box account.

384
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:13,028
Guy at the facility gave it to me.

385
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:15,770
Do I want to know how you
got him to tell you that?

386
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:17,232
Let him take a selfie.

387
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,043
Definitely not the
answer I was expecting.

388
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:22,494
Let me guess. Batman
never posed for selfies.

389
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:24,636
Wasn't gonna say it.

390
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:32,746
I think I found Magpie's nest.

391
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:37,009
I see jewelry, a computer, 3-D printer,

392
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:38,769
and my breath ring's freezing.

393
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:40,589
Oh, that's smart. It's climate-rigged.

394
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,146
If anyone enters, their
body heat will raise

395
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:44,349
the room's temperature
and set off an explosion.

396
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:46,137
You may want to lead with that.

397
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,686
Sorry, but yo. Check this out.

398
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:51,305
The suit can lower your body
temperature to match the room

399
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:53,368
and bypass the sensors.

400
00:21:53,371 --> 00:21:55,020
That is uncomfortably cold.

401
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,064
Rather cold than dead.

402
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:57,853
- Oh. One more thing.
- What?

403
00:21:57,856 --> 00:21:59,024
You know you can't breathe, right?

404
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,145
- You're kidding me.
- I didn't invent kinetic energy.

405
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:02,370
How long can you hold your breath for?

406
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:04,035
Gets dicey after two minutes.

407
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:06,057
All right. That's as long as you got.

408
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,297
Actually, now might be a
good time to let you know

409
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,050
that I fixed the Batarang,

410
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:30,220
and by fixed, I mean realized
it was calibrated for Bruce,

411
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,656
who has longer arms than you.

412
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:34,399
Guess it wasn't entirely your fault.

413
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:36,463
You're probably thinking some
pretty choice words right now,

414
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:38,424
but since you'll blow up
if you say them out loud,

415
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:40,200
probably best to keep them to yourself.

416
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:43,797
Anyway, all fixed, recalibrated for you,

417
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,152
a woman with slightly shorter arms.

418
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:47,745
Oh. While you're in there

419
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:49,839
if you can try to clone
a copy of her hard drive,

420
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:50,712
that'd be great.

421
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:52,115
Might give us a clue
into what Magpie gets

422
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:54,493
her talons into next.

423
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:11,928
Definitely been a minute.

424
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,604
Still alive? Don't answer that.

425
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:19,331
Ah-choo!

426
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:20,585
Did you just...

427
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,326
Why?

428
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,768
No! Don't want to.

429
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,006
Alice!

430
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:44,976
Help me.

431
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:46,476
Alice.

432
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:49,853
No. I'm not actually Ali...

433
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:58,435
Curiouser and curiouser.

434
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,223
Alice?

435
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,935
Yes, darling.

436
00:24:06,937 --> 00:24:10,978
It's me. It's Alice.

437
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:12,597
Where am I?

438
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,367
You're in the rabbit hole, darling,

439
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,371
with the caterpillar and the mad hatter

440
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:22,024
and the Queen of Hearts.

441
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:25,712
I'm actually quite happy you're here.

442
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,457
You see, I've foolishly
forgotten the details

443
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:31,200
of my evil plan.

444
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:33,386
Perhaps you could...

445
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,101
stir up a memory or two.

446
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:42,566
She... she thinks

447
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:45,713
it's me you care about.

448
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,904
Who, dear? The Batwoman?

449
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:53,945
Darling?

450
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:56,433
Finish your thought. The Batwoman thinks

451
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:58,486
I care about whom?

452
00:24:58,488 --> 00:25:02,582
She... has no idea.

453
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,585
About... about who?

454
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,516
Who? Who?

455
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,593
Mouse.

456
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:15,733
She has... big plans for him.

457
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,678
- In position.
- Let me know when you see her.

458
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:44,950
Way too much tempting
bling for her not show.

459
00:25:44,953 --> 00:25:46,625
What is that noise?

460
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,256
Magpie had some complicated schematics

461
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:50,946
for something on her hard drive.

462
00:25:50,948 --> 00:25:52,897
They're encrypted, but
I'll try printing them.

463
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,801
Whatever it is could be her next target

464
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,883
and help us track her down.

465
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:57,093
I got to go.

466
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:58,655
Go where?

467
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,724
Reagan's here.

468
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,534
Wait. You invited her to a takedown.

469
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:05,478
I invited her on a
date that just happens

470
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,980
to be at the takedown location.

471
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,627
I don't need to tell you that...

472
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,078
Batman would have
never done that. I know.

473
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,036
Is it done?

474
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:32,128
Does this look done to you?

475
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:33,565
Oh, my God.

476
00:26:33,567 --> 00:26:38,702
That bitch is a rare
breed of psychopath, okay?

477
00:26:38,704 --> 00:26:41,724
Take your money, take your power.

478
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:45,927
I don't care. It is
your mess, Catherine.

479
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:48,921
You want her gone, do it yourself.

480
00:26:52,602 --> 00:26:53,918
This is Catherine.

481
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,922
"'Oh, dear, oh, dear.
I shall be too late'",

482
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:59,866
said the rabbit, tapping at his watch."

Kate.

490
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:59,167
Sophie, um, I didn't know
you were working the event.

491
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:01,243
I wasn't, but I figured

492
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,262
with a jewelry thief on the prowl

493
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,386
we could use the extra manpower.

494
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:06,889
Of course you did.

495
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:09,061
- Kate.
- Reagan, hi.

496
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,375
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh.

497
00:28:11,378 --> 00:28:13,588
Hey. Reagan.

498
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,799
- Sophie.
- Figured.

499
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:23,116
Sorry. I didn't realize
you were here with anyone.

500
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:29,311
I got us drinks.

501
00:28:29,314 --> 00:28:31,164
You two have fun.

502
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,794
So... I don't know about you,

503
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,337
but I'm gonna drink this and pretend

504
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:57,567
it's not totally uncomfortable
that your ex is here.

505
00:29:02,564 --> 00:29:04,623
Sorry. I...

506
00:29:06,935 --> 00:29:11,145
Ahem. I'm being a really crappy date.

507
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:14,000
Can we start over and I mention

508
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,860
how beautiful you look?

509
00:29:16,862 --> 00:29:21,991
Thank you, and I hate that that worked.

510
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,043
Miss Kane, welcome.

511
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:25,511
I'm so glad you made it.

512
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,956
I'm sorry the pearls didn't.

513
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,289
What do you mean?

514
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,424
Didn't Luke Fox get in touch with you?

515
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:32,612
Yes, but I was just so relived

516
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:34,409
when the security guard
showed up with them

517
00:29:34,412 --> 00:29:35,971
in the nick of time.

518
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,691
Perfect timing. Excuse me.

519
00:29:40,386 --> 00:29:42,937
Ladies and gentlemen,

520
00:29:42,939 --> 00:29:45,631
tonight, we are here to celebrate

521
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:48,135
powerful women throughout history,

522
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:51,774
and who better embodies
that than Martha Wayne?

523
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:55,213
It is with utmost gratitude
to the Wayne estate

524
00:29:55,216 --> 00:29:57,994
that I present to you
tonight's showpiece,

525
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,956
her beloved pearl necklace.

526
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:06,481
Would you excuse me for a minute?

527
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:11,068
I was just about to call you.

528
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:13,083
Martha's necklace is at the
exhibit, which is impossible

529
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:14,261
because we never gave it to the museum.

530
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:16,091
That is not her
necklace. It's a replica.

531
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:17,629
It's the last thing that Magpie printed.

532
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:19,488
She snuck a bomb in here.

533
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,532
Why would Magpie bomb the museum?

534
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:25,069
She's not. It's a Trojan horse.

535
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:26,674
Use the explosion in the
showroom as a distraction,

536
00:30:26,676 --> 00:30:28,746
and she'll have free rein
over the exhibit room.

537
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:34,781
The Wayne family has
been a hallmark to Gotham,

538
00:30:34,784 --> 00:30:38,129
and their legacy lives on even today.

539
00:30:50,685 --> 00:30:52,673
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

540
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:55,930
it looks like we have a
little situation on our hands.

541
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:58,716
Everyone, please move towards the exit.

542
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:11,704
Everyone, calmly towards the exit.

543
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:18,128
Ha ha ha ha!

544
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:26,606
I'm not meant to be a jailbird.

545
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:28,838
Looks like you have a choice to make.

546
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,747
The shiny jewels are all insured,

547
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,125
but those sitting ducks
only have one life.

548
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:37,605
Heh heh. Which are you gonna save?

549
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:39,264
Ha ha ha!

550
00:31:58,024 --> 00:31:59,816
Ha ha ha!

551
00:32:03,276 --> 00:32:04,997
Ha! Ha ha!

552
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,467
Ha ha ha!

553
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:28,072
Mommy, I found a marble.

554
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:42,987
Whoa. It's really you.

555
00:32:58,923 --> 00:33:00,974
It's over.

556
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,922
I've seen you before.
You're the photographer.

557
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:20,470
You weren't just taking photos at
Wayne Tower. You were casing it.

558
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:22,978
People like you never
notice people like me.

559
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,522
You put a lot of lives
in danger tonight.

560
00:33:25,524 --> 00:33:28,000
Well, some of us don't
have the privilege

561
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:30,171
of sitting in our tower, having angst

562
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:34,006
about what to do with
our lives, Miss Kane.

563
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:38,085
They just do it to survive.

564
00:33:38,087 --> 00:33:40,763
Time to go to Blackgate, Margot.

565
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:49,096
Hey. Did you see that?

566
00:33:49,098 --> 00:33:51,471
I didn't. I was on... a call.

567
00:33:51,474 --> 00:33:53,359
Batwoman showed up. It was surreal.

568
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:54,860
I tried calling you.

569
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:58,305
I must have been in a dead zone.

570
00:33:58,307 --> 00:34:01,635
You just said you were on a call.

571
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:04,371
I did. I...

572
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:08,710
So... here's why this sucks.

573
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,567
I like you.

574
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:14,288
You're funny, you're cool,

575
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,790
but that's not really enough.

576
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,733
I'm not a needy person, Kate,

577
00:34:18,736 --> 00:34:20,613
but if I'm gonna make an effort,

578
00:34:20,616 --> 00:34:25,724
miss a spin class or
rearrange a work shift,

579
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:30,187
all I ask for is a little honesty.

580
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:33,732
Here's why this sucks.

581
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:36,215
I think you're fun and cool

582
00:34:36,218 --> 00:34:39,447
and seem to care about
all the right things...

583
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,432
But I'm not in a place right now

584
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:47,913
where I can share all of
myself with someone else.

585
00:34:52,587 --> 00:34:56,279
I am sorry.

586
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:58,740
I get it.

587
00:34:58,742 --> 00:35:01,927
You obviously have a lot going on.

588
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:05,386
I just hope whatever it is

589
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:07,448
makes you happy.

590
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:33,334
Well... this is a nice surprise.

591
00:35:36,113 --> 00:35:38,872
Sweetheart, you okay?

592
00:35:38,874 --> 00:35:41,074
Alice came to me today.

593
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:44,211
She... she came to
you? Are you all right?

594
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:48,123
Yeah, I'm fine. She didn't hurt me.

595
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,292
She wants something.

596
00:35:50,294 --> 00:35:51,977
Hamilton is developing a new project,

597
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:54,620
and Alice has taken interest.

598
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:56,089
Well, what?

599
00:35:56,092 --> 00:35:59,685
It doesn't matter. I
refuse to put any weapon

600
00:35:59,688 --> 00:36:01,803
into the hands of a terrorist.

601
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:06,200
Don't answer that. It could be her.

602
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:08,160
Well, if it's her, I should get it.

603
00:36:08,162 --> 00:36:11,479
Jacob, please.

604
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:14,575
You should hear this from me.

605
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:18,590
Sweetheart, what's going on?

606
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,468
It was years ago.

607
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:26,036
I thought it was the right thing to do.

608
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:29,748
You thought what was
the right thing to do?

609
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,427
You and Kate wouldn't stop looking.

610
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:35,139
Kate was up all night.

611
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:37,400
She wasn't going to school,

612
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,024
she was refusing to eat.

613
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:41,026
She wouldn't give up, and she wasn't

614
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:42,510
living her life,

615
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:45,764
and the more despair that she felt,

616
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:48,725
the more broken you became.

617
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:50,393
What did you do, Catherine?

618
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:54,707
You were both in a
downward spiral, Jacob.

619
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:59,712
You never would have
moved on if you didn't...

620
00:36:59,714 --> 00:37:03,382
Think that Beth were dead.

621
00:37:03,384 --> 00:37:06,719
They found bones,

622
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:08,411
skull fragments.

623
00:37:08,413 --> 00:37:13,083
Hamilton employees found bones

624
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:15,060
from a deer.

625
00:37:17,372 --> 00:37:22,593
I paid the DNA analyst
to write the report.

626
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:25,297
The police, my investigators,

627
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,381
the entire city had been
looking and looking for Beth

628
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:31,343
without finding so
much as a sock, Jacob.

629
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:34,512
- She was gone.
- Stop.

630
00:37:34,514 --> 00:37:37,377
Get away from me.

631
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,725
Just...

632
00:37:39,728 --> 00:37:42,319
Just get away from me.

633
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:02,472
You... have to stop doing that.

634
00:38:02,475 --> 00:38:05,168
Sudden adrenaline release
can lead to cardiac arrest,

635
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,386
and I am way too busy to have

636
00:38:06,388 --> 00:38:08,606
a heart condition right now.

637
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:10,387
You fixed him?

638
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,050
He's stable.

639
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:14,594
An hour later, and I may
not have been able to.

640
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:18,640
You were right. I shouldn't
have let him get this bad.

641
00:38:18,642 --> 00:38:21,267
Yeah. So on that topic,

642
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:23,433
I may have prodded him a little

643
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:25,703
while he was under a morphine haze.

644
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:28,344
I know, but he ruined
my favorite plaid shirt

645
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,235
when he stabbed me,

646
00:38:30,237 --> 00:38:35,115
so my point is Alice
is looking for a mouse

647
00:38:35,117 --> 00:38:37,167
or someone named Mouse.

648
00:38:37,169 --> 00:38:38,828
He said Mouse,

649
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:42,339
and she has big plans for him.

650
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:46,226
So thought you should know.

651
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:48,220
Ooh. Ooh, ooh! Whoa!

652
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:51,273
Whoa! Hang on! You can't just... gah!

653
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:53,092
What is that?!

654
00:38:53,095 --> 00:38:54,735
Subdermal transponder.

655
00:38:54,737 --> 00:38:56,593
- A what?
- Chipped him.

656
00:38:56,596 --> 00:38:59,061
He leads me Alice, if
figure out who Mouse is.

657
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:01,758
Oh, okay. Okay.

658
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,978
Good work, Mary.

659
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:06,597
Thank you.

660
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,634
The bomb-loving bird
is finally in a cage,

661
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:37,802
where she belongs.

662
00:39:37,804 --> 00:39:39,912
Batwoman clipped her wings,

663
00:39:39,915 --> 00:39:41,966
and she wasn't very
sweet about it either.

664
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:45,628
Hey, Batwoman. You
have such a pretty face.

665
00:39:45,631 --> 00:39:48,021
Ever think about smiling more?

666
00:39:48,023 --> 00:39:49,991
Another win in the Batcolumn.

667
00:39:49,994 --> 00:39:52,900
Almost got a compliment out
of Vesper Fairchild, too.

668
00:39:52,903 --> 00:39:54,819
I reunited a bunch of
billionaires with things

669
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:56,027
they probably didn't miss.

670
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,880
You also saved a lot of innocent lives.

671
00:39:57,883 --> 00:39:59,640
The city trusts you now.

672
00:39:59,643 --> 00:40:02,678
They trust Batwoman. Kate
Kane is a different story.

673
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,005
What do you know about real estate?

674
00:40:05,007 --> 00:40:06,805
Um, everyone hates popcorn ceilings.

675
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:08,450
So more than me.

676
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:10,926
I'm starting a real estate firm.

677
00:40:10,929 --> 00:40:13,615
Okay. So the last thing the city needs

678
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:16,091
is another predatory developer
cluttering the skyline.

679
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:19,010
I agree. That's why I want
to buy run-down buildings

680
00:40:19,012 --> 00:40:20,771
from outside the Crows districts,

681
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:21,880
keep the rents low,

682
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:23,482
and give them back to the community.

683
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:24,940
So Bruce was a billionaire playboy,

684
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:26,786
and you're gonna be
who... Joanna Gaines?

685
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:28,767
- You can be Chip.
- I just told you

686
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,179
I don't know anything about real estate.

687
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:31,281
Well, you better learn quick because

688
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:32,565
you're gonna be my assistant.

689
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:35,586
- Associate.
- Hmm. Up for debate.

690
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:41,741
Dear Bruce, Queen Rihanna was right.

691
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:44,536
Lies don't make anyone comfortable,

692
00:40:44,538 --> 00:40:47,038
especially the one telling them,

693
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,344
but no one said anything about
this job being comfortable.

694
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:57,491
If I'm going to embrace the Bat,

695
00:40:57,494 --> 00:41:00,685
then I'm going to have to
embrace hiding a part of myself

696
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:02,479
from the outside world.

697
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:05,592
Living this double
life is a sacrifice...

698
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:08,934
But our city is worth it.

699
