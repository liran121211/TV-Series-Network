1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:02,034
Previously on "Batwoman"...

2
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:04,712
Kate, it's Mary. Sophie's missing.

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:06,155
- Kate.
- Hey, Dad.

4
00:00:06,157 --> 00:00:08,359
- We're gonna find her.
- Then let me help.

5
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:09,835
Who the hell are you?

6
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:11,260
I'm Alice.

7
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:12,962
Bruce never stopped looking

8
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:14,060
for your sister's body.

9
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:16,223
Guy had the best tech on the planet.

10
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:18,097
Why didn't he find her?

11
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,516
Pick one, Commander...

12
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,092
Sophie or... Gotham.

13
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:23,531
Why are you doing this?

14
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:25,811
Hyah!

15
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:28,389
I am not used to being found.

16
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:29,441
Clever girl.

17
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:30,685
Let's take a picture, Beth.

18
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:33,455
Make sure our necklaces are in it.

19
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,002
Beth.

20
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:44,234
Mom! Mom, wake up!

21
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:45,697
Tell me something, Bruce.

22
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:47,891
What's the difference
between being hopeful

23
00:00:47,894 --> 00:00:49,274
and being crazy?

24
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:50,593
Kate!

25
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:52,023
Because whatever it is got me

26
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:54,478
through that day and
the years that followed.

27
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:57,172
Mom, Beth!

28
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:00,176
Beth wasn't found in
the car with my mom,

29
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:02,533
and as long as there wasn't a body,

30
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:04,161
there was hope.

31
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,927
The entire city went out
looking that first night...

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,093
But days went by

33
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:12,471
and then weeks and then months,

34
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,330
and eventually, it
was just my dad and me.

35
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,934
- Beth!
- Beth!

36
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:19,478
A decade and a half later,

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,772
and my dad and I are still looking,

38
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:23,699
but while I'm looking for my sister,

39
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:26,339
my dad is looking for
someone else entirely.

40
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:31,102
Alice is a lunatic, Dodgson a traitor,

41
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:34,326
a former Crow turned Wonderland
Gang second in command.

42
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,176
Together, they want to
terrorize the citizens of Gotham

43
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:41,272
by undermining the people
actually protecting them... us.

44
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:46,736
I want them stopped...

45
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,548
Dead or alive.

46
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,623
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Let's bounce.

47
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:23,744
Cool.

48
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:40,893
Where's Alice?

49
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:50,225
What the hell is that?

50
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,409
My dad would never believe my theory

51
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,078
that Alice was Beth, but
I didn't have a choice.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,964
I had to make him understand

53
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,484
before the Crows killed her first.

55
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:53,423
3 hours later, where the hell were you?

56
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:55,594
- Around.
- Did anyone see you...

57
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:58,095
Bystanders, police,
cameras, cell phones?

58
00:03:58,097 --> 00:04:00,265
Seriously, Kate. You can't
be going out in Gotham

59
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:02,349
every night pretending to be Batman.

60
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:04,619
I need to find her.

61
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:11,792
If Alice is my sister, I need to know.

62
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,369
Good morning, Gotham.

63
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,162
Your bestie Vesper Fairchild here.

64
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:16,998
On a normal Tuesday, I'd want to know

65
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:19,553
who wore who to last
night's Gotham Gala,

66
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:21,722
who got drunk, who got clawed,

67
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:24,123
but Batman fever is upon us, people.

68
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:27,363
It has been 4 days
since we saw him soaring

69
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:29,051
through the sky, and it's still

70
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:30,369
all anyone can tweet about.

71
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,574
Is Batman finally back
after a 3-year hiatus?

72
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:34,716
Talk to me, Gotham.

73
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:35,767
I think it's him.

74
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,937
If you look at that picture
they have in the paper,

75
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,147
it's his cape.

76
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,183
It's iconic.

77
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,787
Heard Alice's gang firebombed

78
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,265
a Crows truck last night.

79
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:45,353
Batman picked a good time to come home.

80
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:46,759
In my search for Alice,

81
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:48,030
something else happened.

82
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:50,746
A city divided by walls,
money, and bad luck

83
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,859
rallied around a
single hope, Bruce, you,

84
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,809
except I was too busy to notice.

85
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,866
I don't like their
market response to the AR.

86
00:04:57,868 --> 00:05:01,033
Let's pull out and see if we
can spark interest in Dubai.

87
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:04,638
Do you see this baby turtle
eating this strawberry?

88
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,843
It's so cute. I want one.

89
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:09,374
- Morning, everyone.
- Morning.

90
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,682
Heard the Crows killed a
lead on Alice last night.

91
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,671
Maybe if you reconsidered
my offer to join my team,

92
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:16,173
you could help us with that.

93
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:18,786
The Crows aren't really a
good fit for me right now.

94
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:20,719
Because of Sophie? Oh, my God!

95
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:21,735
Can we talk about the fact that

96
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,512
she's married to a man?

97
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:25,366
- Let's not.
- I'm not trying to label her

98
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,312
or anything, but
what's her deal exactly?

99
00:05:27,315 --> 00:05:29,518
She's married, honey. Drop it.

100
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:31,599
Yeah. I get that, but she could still be

101
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:34,804
bi, bicurious, pan, poly, omni...

102
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:36,941
I think Alice is Beth.

103
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,269
Whoa.

104
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,852
Heh. Kate, what are you talking about?

105
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:44,688
That's ridiculous.

106
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,524
I thought they found her body.

107
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:48,199
They found bone fragments.

108
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:50,890
Skull fragments matching Beth's DNA.

109
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,218
I was able to get one of Alice's knives.

110
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,139
It has a garnet stone, our birth stone.

111
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:58,878
If we can test the knife for DNA...

112
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,900
Kate, listen to yourself.

113
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,696
She has a vendetta against you. Why?

114
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,706
Why not kill me when she had the chance,

115
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:08,257
and why does she seem to
know everything about me?

116
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,395
I know that you want to
believe that Beth is alive.

117
00:06:11,397 --> 00:06:15,547
I do, too, but facts are facts.

118
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,291
Beth's dead.

119
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,937
Katie, Alice kidnapped Sophie.

120
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,537
She drove a bomb into
a park full of families.

121
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,833
She killed two police
officers in cold blood.

122
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:26,618
How on earth could she be Beth?

123
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,805
Alice is Beth, and I'll prove it to you.

124
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:36,437
Such a lovely home. So
nice of you to let us stay.

125
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,180
Is the pleasure of making a daisy chain

126
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:41,007
worth the trouble of getting
up and picking the daisies?

127
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,686
We're all thinking it.
You should give up, Alice.

128
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:45,429
Simon's dead, Gus is in the wind,

129
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:47,465
and we're all scampering
about from hole to hole,

130
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:51,057
trying to avoid getting
snatched up by our tails...

131
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,940
But we're still poor, are we not?

132
00:06:56,942 --> 00:07:00,193
We're still vulnerable, are we not,

133
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:03,828
and they are still rich and powerful

134
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:08,209
and protected by the Crows.

135
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:10,042
Bullies paid for by richer bullies

136
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:12,046
all with the goal of
sweeping us into the shadows

137
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,099
to be forgotten.

138
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:15,009
Ha ha ha!

139
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:20,221
Ohh. Jacob Kane is not man enough

140
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:21,950
to protect this city

141
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:23,508
because he's a quitter,

142
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,447
and when things get
difficult, he gives up.

143
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:32,676
I think it's time for Gotham to watch

144
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,907
Commander Crow squirm.

145
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,083
Tell me you found my favorite knife.

146
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,219
No luck.

147
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:45,270
What the hell did I do with it?

148
00:07:45,273 --> 00:07:47,842
It is so much more fun
unveiling my evil plan

149
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:49,659
when I can flip it about for cadence.

150
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:52,496
And how does Kate Kane
fit into that evil plan?

151
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:59,581
Now you are so cute when you're jealous.

152
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,716
I want to make sure we stay on point...

153
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,482
uproot the city's
confidence in the Crows,

154
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:10,102
let chaos reign.

155
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,158
It's so boring when he says it.

156
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,905
You're making this personal, Alice.

157
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:19,474
It is personal!

158
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:22,370
My father gave up on me,

159
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,381
and I want to make him suffer

160
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:25,778
the way that I did

161
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:28,204
by stripping away everything

162
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,058
that he cares about

163
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:34,236
until he's all alone.

164
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:39,588
Where is my damn knife?!

165
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,759
Mom, Beth!

166
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:52,487
Beth!

167
00:08:56,513 --> 00:08:59,198
Hey, kiddo. You're okay.

168
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:02,852
I'm right here. Oh.

169
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:06,541
Ahh. Same one?

170
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:15,095
You, uh... you know, you have a bed.

171
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,516
I need to stay out
here in case she calls.

172
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:21,001
Ahh.

173
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:30,872
Dad?

174
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,877
Do you promise we'll
never stop looking for her?

175
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,731
I promise.

176
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:51,448
Got your text. Uh, yes, technically,

177
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,635
Wayne is in possession of a
thermal cycler and PCR mixers.

178
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,328
- PCR?
- Polymerase Chain Reaction.

179
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,816
It's used to separate and amplify DNA,

180
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:01,660
which then needs to be analyzed
against another sample for a match.

181
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:03,876
So if I could provide
you with another sample?

182
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,480
Sorry. I just keep the doors
locked and the lights on.

183
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:08,798
For Bruce Wayne, who isn't here.

184
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,949
Currently but not ultimately,
which is why we need

185
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:13,643
to talk about his suit.

186
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,013
Are you watching the news?

187
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:17,324
The city is clamoring for
a hero that isn't here,

188
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,827
and I know you don't want to
be the city's next great hope,

189
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,498
but it's too late because
they think you're him.

190
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,808
I need that suit to stop Alice.

191
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:28,828
My cousin figured it out years ago.

192
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:31,216
Be more terrifying than your enemy.

193
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,250
Do you know what this is?

194
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:37,402
A... Bat... weapon.

195
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:41,060
Laser saw. This thing
will cut through anything.

196
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:43,063
Cool.

197
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,388
What about this?

198
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:46,020
- Gas mask?
- Rebreather

199
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:48,248
to breathe underwater without a tank.

200
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:50,214
See, these aren't toys.

201
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,050
These are one-of-a-kind, dangerous tools

202
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,085
which even I don't know how to use.

203
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,012
I don't how to use
half the stuff in here

204
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:57,865
because it's not meant for me.

205
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,027
It's meant for Batman.

206
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,852
- You know who you sound like?
- I'm sure you'll tell me.

207
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:04,580
Lucius Fox.

208
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:07,899
Trust me. I am a far cry from my father.

209
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:11,201
Oh, I know. He was actually useful.

210
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,740
That's funny.

211
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:24,892
"Define the goal, define the objective,

212
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:27,919
define the terms of victory."

213
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,870
Your dad made those for the office.

214
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:32,758
Now imagine him teaching
you how to play tee-ball.

215
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,411
Is this you?

216
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,494
What? This... this dude in the picture?

217
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:54,672
The person in this
picture dressed as Batman

218
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:56,239
who saved my life the other night.

219
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:58,110
- Was that you?
- Anyone who knows me knows

220
00:11:58,113 --> 00:11:59,153
I hate Batman.

221
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:01,152
So does your dad, which would make

222
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:04,775
putting on this suit an
incredibly reckless move.

223
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:07,369
Wasn't me. Besides,

224
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:10,795
if I were gonna save you
in a dramatic fashion,

225
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,899
I would totally dress as Wonder Woman.

226
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,202
Can we go somewhere private?

227
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,702
I need you to run that for DNA.

228
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,478
Alice tried to kill me.

229
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,015
She put me on a plank 20 stories
in the air and watched it drop.

230
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,314
She's sick.

231
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:34,558
She's a monster, Kate.

232
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,130
She's not your twin.

233
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,126
If I can get her DNA off the knife,

234
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,421
I can compare it with my own.

235
00:12:40,424 --> 00:12:44,661
Look. I know why you
want Beth to be alive,

236
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,957
but aren't you getting
your hopes up over nothing?

237
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,965
Maybe... but you know me and hope.

238
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,583
Your dad would kill me. I can't.

239
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:10,906
You know, if... if I'd known
you were getting married,

240
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:14,192
I would have come back sooner.

241
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,911
I didn't think weddings were your thing.

242
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:21,331
Not to go. To stop it.

243
00:13:30,246 --> 00:13:31,570
Thanks.

244
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:33,632
Yeah.

245
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:38,475
You've got something of Alice's.

246
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,184
Ohh!

247
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,140
Ohh!

248
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,792
Got it, got it! Go, go, go!

249
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,307
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

250
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:19,346
Are you, though?

251
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:21,525
Not really.

252
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,339
This is exactly what
I was worried about.

253
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:26,339
You put yourself directly
in Alice's crosshairs,

254
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:27,952
and you brought her
right to our doorstep.

255
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,516
How the hell did she
even know I had her knife?

256
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:32,662
Are you hearing yourself? Talk
some sense into her, please.

257
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:35,409
All due respect, sir,
I don't see any harm

258
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:37,714
in running a DNA test on
Alice if we can catch her.

259
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:39,201
My daughter died.

260
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:41,098
I have the lab results that prove it.

261
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:43,542
Alice... that thing... Is a cop killer

262
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:45,587
who drove enough C4 into Robinson Park

263
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,371
to level a square block.

264
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:50,223
I am not saying Alice is a good person.

265
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:53,042
All I'm saying it has been 15 years.

266
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:56,614
We don't know what happened to her.

267
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:59,229
What if somewhere
deep down inside of her

268
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,441
she is actually Beth?

269
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:06,922
The GCPD just gave us the
green light to put her down.

270
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:08,878
I'm not wasting the shot.

271
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,030
Excuse me, sir.

272
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,625
Update on missing
rabbit from last night.

273
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:14,211
Traced him into tricorner,

274
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,765
found a blood trail, then it disappears

275
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:18,050
somewhere around Bennett Ave.

276
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,271
Bennet Ave.

277
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:26,927
What are you doing here?

278
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:28,900
Is there a password or something?

279
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,578
Get in here.

280
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,120
It goes without saying,
but this clinic breaks

281
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:35,635
no less than 10 laws an hour,

282
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:38,209
and considering that
your dad runs the Crows...

283
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:39,879
- Not planning to tell him.
- Good because it's

284
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:41,690
hard enough balancing
this with med school,

285
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:44,495
and I can't exactly protest
Gotham's failing healthcare system

286
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:46,113
from the inside of a prison cell.

287
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:50,097
What's your stance on
doctor-patient confidentiality?

288
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,241
Hmm.

289
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:55,764
Came in this morning,
bleeding pretty bad.

290
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:58,229
Won't say anything. Not unusual,

291
00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:02,268
but then look at what I
pulled out of his scapula.

292
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:04,330
Ha! He's a Batman victim.

293
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,942
I'm so keeping this, FYI.

294
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:10,279
He's one of Alice's guys.

295
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,447
- I saw it on the news.
- Good to know.

296
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,596
Actually, I'm really
glad that you're here.

297
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,736
I was thinking that we haven't
really had any sister time

298
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:18,914
since you've been back,

299
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:21,644
and I was just reading about
this brand-new plant-based cafe

300
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,461
that is so organic your fork
literally dissolves in your hand

301
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:26,871
if you don't eat fast enough.

302
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:28,693
- Sounds good.
- Oh, cool.

303
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,236
Okay. So see you back here at 7:00.

304
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,371
Whoa!

305
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,288
Not sure that that's
a good idea considering

306
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,698
he's a domestic terrorist.

307
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:39,795
I need you to send a message
to Alice from Kate Kane.

308
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:43,053
Waffles.

309
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:46,539
- Now get out of here.
- Ugh.

310
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,889
Waffles?

311
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:50,000
If Alice is Beth, she'll
know what it means.

312
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:51,270
What does it mean?

313
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:53,236
It's better if you don't know.

314
00:16:56,596 --> 00:16:58,572
See you at 7:00.

315
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:04,733
Surveillance narrows them
to the Kubert district.

316
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:08,320
Caught Dodgson in
an alley about 3 hours ago.

317
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:11,198
The rabbit we shot last night
was seen at a C Store earlier

318
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,707
just a few blocks away.

319
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,113
Must be hovering around there.

320
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,869
In a suburban, white
picket fence neighborhood?

321
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:21,733
Not really the M.O. of a
gang who hides in the shadows.

322
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,668
I know where they are.

323
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:28,224
Get every available man
to 1472 Norman Drive now.

324
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:29,584
Sir?

325
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:32,213
We're wasting time.

326
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:39,927
Hey. I can't really talk.

327
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,830
Then just say yes. I need
you to buy me some time

328
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:42,831
while I find Alice.

329
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:43,875
Kate, it's too late.

330
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:45,553
I just need you to stall the Crows

331
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:47,030
for a couple of hours.

332
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,442
Kate, I'm not helping you
if I don't know what you did.

333
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,569
I got her a message.

334
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,329
I asked her to meet
at our favorite place,

335
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:55,699
and if she's really Beth,
she'll know what it means.

336
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:58,319
The waffle stand.

337
00:17:58,322 --> 00:17:59,496
You remembered.

338
00:17:59,499 --> 00:18:01,243
You know how dangerous she is.

339
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,766
Don't do this.

340
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:06,025
My dad is going to
kill my sister, Sophie.

341
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:10,733
Please just... buy me some time

342
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:13,486
so I can prove him wrong.

343
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:24,922
Oh, come on.

344
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,358
No. Hey, hey. Why are you doing that?

345
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,111
Uh...

346
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,340
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing, Luke?

347
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,343
It's not a toy.

348
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:43,887
Stop.

349
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:48,198
Oh, please just...

350
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,263
Whoa. I did not mean to...

351
00:18:57,913 --> 00:18:59,504
Okay.

352
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:48,986
What, you don't like
chocolate all of a sudden, huh?

353
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,581
I'm not hungry.

354
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:53,192
Come on. You're the world record holder

355
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:55,913
for fastest waffle consumption.

356
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:58,632
- Title's in jeopardy.
- We shouldn't be eating.

357
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:00,892
We should be looking for Beth.

358
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,064
Ahh. Been looking for months.

359
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:08,402
We deserve a sugar break.

360
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:10,798
It was my fault.

361
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:13,429
Hey. Hey.

362
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:16,525
Why would you say that, huh?

363
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:18,051
You weren't there, Dad.

364
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:20,029
After we crashed, Beth went to check

365
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:21,363
on Mom in the front seat.

366
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:25,520
Instead of helping, I climbed out.

367
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:28,294
I left her.

368
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:30,940
You... you were being safe.

369
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:36,274
But I could have grabbed her,

370
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,607
but I was too scared if
my feet left the ground

371
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,441
I'd go over, too.

372
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:44,578
I should have just climbed
on the car and grabbed her.

373
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,391
She was my sister. Why
didn't I try a little harder?

374
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:52,463
Come here... come here.

375
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:54,549
You're okay.

376
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:07,858
Oh, my God!

377
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:16,340
They're gone, sir.

378
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:19,164
TV dinner still in the microwave.

379
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,666
Damn it.

380
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,754
How did you know she was here?

381
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:26,341
Beth grew up here.

382
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:28,102
This was our old house.

383
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:30,956
Sir... you don't think...

384
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,420
Of course not. She's
trying to get in my head.

385
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:34,896
It's not gonna work.

386
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:52,112
Well, look who finally figured it out.

387
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:04,379
Are you my sister?

388
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:07,546
Mmm. Who in the world am I?

389
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:10,708
Now that is the great puzzle, isn't it?

390
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:14,187
Did you know I was gonna have
your knife tested for DNA?

391
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:20,552
You had my knife? Ha ha!

392
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:22,554
And here I've been going around using

393
00:22:22,556 --> 00:22:26,082
this charmless contraption.

394
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:27,844
You didn't have your guys jump me.

395
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:32,379
Jump you? Kate, we're sisters.

396
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:36,164
Prove it. Let me test your
DNA before the Crows kill you.

397
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,292
I already proved it.

398
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:39,753
I'm here.

399
00:22:39,756 --> 00:22:43,108
I knew the password, "Waffles,"

400
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,076
our favorite spot.

401
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,269
We used to come here
after school on Fridays

402
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:52,721
and gorge our faces in
chocolate-covered garbage.

403
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:55,392
How else would I know that...

404
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:59,102
Unless...

405
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:00,938
Oh, dear.

406
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:03,199
Did the press mention that you and Beth

407
00:23:03,202 --> 00:23:06,137
used to come here as part of
your silly, little tradition,

408
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,707
and did I read an old article...

409
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,478
online?

410
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,603
- Sir.
- We're going to tricorner.

411
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:32,557
They just left. Can't be too far.

412
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,077
Sir, she's not in tricorner.

413
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,854
I want checkpoints on all the bridges.

414
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:38,473
Sir...

415
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:41,713
I know where she is.

416
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:43,641
They found skull fragments.

417
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:44,735
They declared you dead.

418
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:46,262
Then why are you still here?

419
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:47,556
If I were really your twin,

420
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,814
wouldn't you feel something?

421
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,131
How did you survive the crash?

422
00:23:57,133 --> 00:24:02,562
Crash? The crash? Oh, yes, the crash.

423
00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:04,585
Hmm. Let's see. We hit the water

424
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:06,680
with a dramatic splash,
and when I opened my eyes,

425
00:24:06,683 --> 00:24:09,275
my mother's head was on the
other side of the windshield.

426
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,497
A surreal sight, a motherless head.

427
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,317
Poor Gabi, or was it Abby?

428
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,286
Nevertheless, it was cold.

429
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,488
Have you ever had a
tea party on the inside

430
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,673
of a block of ice?

431
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:22,959
It's much akin to that.

432
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,671
Water rushed through every
seam of the car up to my knees

433
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:26,999
and then to my neck.

434
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:28,985
Ha! I didn't know
whether to hold my breath

435
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:30,379
or to scream,

436
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:34,234
but as I tilted my head
like a little mouse,

437
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:37,187
sucking in the increasingly shrinking

438
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,665
bubble of air,

439
00:24:38,668 --> 00:24:41,711
one thought kept me calm.

440
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,703
"Surely someone will come and save me."

441
00:24:52,873 --> 00:24:55,081
Feel free to get that.

442
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:00,819
Ahem.

443
00:25:00,822 --> 00:25:02,475
_

444
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:03,665
What's wrong?

445
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,458
No interest in painting your nails,

446
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:09,220
gossiping about boys?

447
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:10,615
We have a lot to catch up on.

448
00:25:10,618 --> 00:25:12,456
Heh. I'd rather not.

449
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:17,937
I came here tonight to ask
you one simple question.

450
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,224
After I disappeared,

451
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,349
when did you sleep through the night

452
00:25:22,352 --> 00:25:25,236
for the very first time?

453
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,338
I haven't yet.

454
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:30,883
Heh. Sure you have.

455
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,684
I never moved on.

456
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,279
Why is that?

457
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:38,641
Because I never gave up
hope that I would find you.

458
00:25:38,644 --> 00:25:40,661
And why is that?

459
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:45,523
Because I should have been with you.

460
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,603
Here's my DNA, dear.
Go prove it to Daddy.

461
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:01,405
Target green. I have a clear shot.

462
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:03,877
- Tattletale.
- What?

463
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:12,461
Get out of the way, Kate.

464
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:14,288
Tell your men to stand down.

465
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,732
Kate, she's in your head.

466
00:26:15,735 --> 00:26:17,593
Then arrest her and get her help.

467
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:19,244
She's got a knife.

468
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:20,892
Drop it, or they will shoot you

469
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:23,254
- and call it self-defense.
- Not if you stay put.

470
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:27,041
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

471
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:30,269
She's your daughter,

472
00:26:30,271 --> 00:26:32,930
and if you kill her,
you won't just lose Beth.

473
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:35,410
You'll lose me, too.

474
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:42,208
Take her to Arkham.

475
00:26:57,665 --> 00:26:59,731
Kate.

476
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:01,483
Kate, hang on.

477
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:04,838
And here I thought you
could keep a secret.

478
00:27:09,235 --> 00:27:12,403
I didn't tell them you'd be here.

479
00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:15,055
"Tell us a story," said the march hare.

480
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:17,866
"Yes, please do," pled Alice,

481
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:19,528
and so the dormouse began

482
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:25,005
"Once upon a time, there
were 3 little sisters."

483
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:26,433
What did you do?

484
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,802
You don't remember why
we'd each have to get

485
00:27:27,804 --> 00:27:31,156
our own waffle when we came here?

486
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:33,238
Because you don't like to share.

487
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:37,653
Exactly, and you are my sister, Kate!

488
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,489
- No.
- Ha ha ha!

489
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,796
Hey. So not to rush you,

490
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,447
but I made 7:00 ressies,

491
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,012
and it's 7:45,

492
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:50,669
and I had to call in a favor for these,

493
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:53,190
so, yeah, okay.

494
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:55,569
Call me. Bye.

495
00:28:00,475 --> 00:28:02,350
Wonderful.

496
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,286
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

497
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:22,806
Alice doesn't like competition.

498
00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:24,124
Ohh!

499
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:25,726
Aah!

500
00:28:29,853 --> 00:28:31,278
Aah!

501
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,081
Agh!

502
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,259
Aah!

503
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:41,095
Psycho!

504
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,474
Agh!

505
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,576
All right.

506
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,534
Here we go.

507
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:14,496
Aah!

508
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:17,718
Aah!

509
00:29:21,752 --> 00:29:23,626
Agh!

510
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:39,545
Plus, find out just how official history

511
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:40,922
will affect his future.

512
00:29:40,925 --> 00:29:43,461
And we have an update on the ongoing

513
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:44,796
Wonderland Gang story.

514
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:47,224
Let's go to our eye in
the sky reporter for more

515
00:29:47,226 --> 00:29:49,226
This is News 8 Gotham in the sky

516
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:50,452
with breaking news.

517
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:52,873
Is the city's nightmare finally over?

518
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:56,170
Alice, the leader of the
Wonderland Gang, has been captured.

519
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:58,477
The Crows apprehended
the notorious killer

520
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,220
minutes ago in Burnside Park.

521
00:30:00,222 --> 00:30:01,755
Now as you can see, we're live.

522
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,506
We're following the prison transport

523
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:04,840
to Arkham, where wait!

524
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:07,452
What... what just happened?

525
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:09,385
The van has exploded.

526
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,508
Uh, Kate, can you hear me?

527
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:31,979
Uh, Batcave to Kate.

528
00:30:31,982 --> 00:30:34,496
- You're still 5 minutes out.
- I can make it.

529
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,572
Tell me you realize that
place is crawling with cops.

530
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:42,908
Go, go, go!

531
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:45,286
If you see her, shoot!

532
00:30:45,288 --> 00:30:47,758
Maybe it was fate watching her

533
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:51,899
drown in a river the way everyone
assumed she had years ago,

534
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,806
and maybe I was meant to stand by

535
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:56,013
and watch it all happen all over again.

536
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:00,168
After all, my dad was right.

537
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,686
Alice was a monster.

538
00:31:01,688 --> 00:31:05,841
She was a liar, a manipulator, a killer,

539
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:07,542
but despite all that...

540
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:11,094
She was still my sister.

541
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:14,292
Grab my hand!

542
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:16,233
Grab my hand!

543
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:58,865
Hey. Batcave to Kate. Batcave to Kate.

544
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:11,914
Kate, are you okay?

545
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:14,001
Batcave to Kate.

546
00:32:14,004 --> 00:32:16,058
Wake up, Kate.

547
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:17,729
Whoever's down here.

548
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:21,516
Hey. Batcave to Kate.
You got a lot of cops

549
00:32:21,518 --> 00:32:23,185
coming towards you right now.

550
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:27,047
You need to get up now. Kate!

551
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:32,852
I know there's a
defibrillator on the suit.

552
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,306
Okay, people. Time to get real.

553
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:55,454
Massive explosion on the
Loeb Bridge last night.

554
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:57,481
The leader of the
Alice in Wonderland Gang

555
00:32:57,484 --> 00:33:01,326
is in the wind, and
Batman was not there.

556
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:04,146
Was there a cowl convention
we didn't know about?

557
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,917
Was it Robin's high school graduation?

558
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,013
Talk to me, Gotham. Did
we put our hope in a ghost?

559
00:33:16,283 --> 00:33:19,452
I just came to apologize
for missing dinner,

560
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,556
but apparently, I missed...

561
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,369
Something else.

562
00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:26,196
Sorry.

563
00:33:29,013 --> 00:33:34,966
So. Okay. Look. I get the
whole needing to know with Alice

564
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:39,947
because she's your sister,
and... duh... sisters...

565
00:33:40,974 --> 00:33:43,235
But her boyfriend tried
to kill me last night

566
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:47,529
because apparently she
sees me as her replacement,

567
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:51,033
which under normal circumstances could,

568
00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:54,778
you know, maybe be borderline flattering

569
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,131
except here it's just ironic

570
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:59,348
considering the most sisterly thing that

571
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:02,741
you've ever done is pretty
much act like I don't exist.

572
00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:05,429
Mary, it's not like that.

573
00:34:06,594 --> 00:34:09,124
Don't worry. You know,

574
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:13,981
he took off and got scared
before doing any permanent damage,

575
00:34:13,983 --> 00:34:16,174
and, no, I didn't tell your dad.

576
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:21,318
The last thing I need is my
own personal security detail.

577
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:25,406
Mary, I am so sorry.

578
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:27,468
Is Alice worth it?

579
00:34:31,742 --> 00:34:35,026
Because if she is,
could you just tell her

580
00:34:35,028 --> 00:34:39,340
that I'm not a threat, please?

581
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,170
How the hell did someone get a bomb

582
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:49,331
on that bridge?

583
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:51,092
There is something else going on here,

584
00:34:51,095 --> 00:34:52,853
and between the Crows and the GCPD,

585
00:34:52,855 --> 00:34:54,608
it needs to start making sense.

586
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:56,527
Get out!

587
00:35:01,713 --> 00:35:03,129
I take it I'm next.

588
00:35:03,132 --> 00:35:04,722
That stunt you pulled,

589
00:35:04,725 --> 00:35:06,596
it's called aiding and abetting.

590
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,548
You crossed the line.

591
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:11,102
And you're about to
kill your own daughter.

592
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:14,148
Now you tell me again
how my daughter did this.

593
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:16,377
She went into the
house where you grew up,

594
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:18,069
she murdered the current owners

595
00:35:18,071 --> 00:35:19,528
by slitting open their throats.

596
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:22,282
She's not Beth, Kate. Drop it now,

597
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:24,442
or I'll have you arrested myself.

598
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,373
Dad?

599
00:36:40,376 --> 00:36:45,271
Oh. Uh... hey, kiddo.

600
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:48,935
Come here.

601
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:55,332
Uh...

602
00:36:55,335 --> 00:37:01,380
Catherine Hamilton's
investigators found bones

603
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:04,602
on Miller Farm.

604
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:08,702
- No.
- Skull fragments of a little girl.

605
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:11,706
They, um...

606
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:13,555
They had them tested,

607
00:37:13,558 --> 00:37:17,226
and it's her, Kate.

608
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:18,596
It's Beth.

609
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,360
No, Dad. I checked Miller
Farm a million times!

610
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:25,738
Kate, they found her.

611
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,868
See? There's nothing there, Dad.

612
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:32,871
I would have seen it. I looked!

613
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:34,497
It's time to say good-bye, Kate.

614
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:36,332
You said you'd never give up!

615
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:38,644
- Kate.
- You're a traitor!

616
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,447
Kate.

617
00:37:48,388 --> 00:37:51,699
She could have killed you.

618
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,512
You totally sold me out.

619
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,185
It's called caring about you.

620
00:37:56,188 --> 00:37:57,244
If you cared, you wouldn't have lied

621
00:37:57,246 --> 00:38:00,372
to an entire military academy about me.

622
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,175
That's not fair, Kate.

623
00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:03,552
So you didn't lie?

624
00:38:03,555 --> 00:38:05,714
I would never lie to you.

625
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:08,109
I won't ever lie to you.

626
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:12,541
Are you happy?

627
00:38:12,544 --> 00:38:15,161
Yes.

628
00:38:15,164 --> 00:38:17,098
Yes or ish?

629
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:21,802
I'm happy, Kate,

630
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:23,722
and...

631
00:38:27,363 --> 00:38:32,449
There is no us, okay?

632
00:38:32,452 --> 00:38:35,087
You need to move on.

633
00:38:49,353 --> 00:38:51,061
Did you get the suit wet?

634
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:53,677
Okay. So I couldn't find
the autodry function.

635
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,420
Yeah, because that's not a thing.

636
00:38:55,422 --> 00:38:58,509
$10.8 million suit. Kind
of feels like an oversight.

637
00:38:58,512 --> 00:39:00,729
Just saying.

638
00:39:00,732 --> 00:39:05,351
Hey. Thank you for bailing me out.

639
00:39:05,354 --> 00:39:07,262
Yeah. I mean, I found the comms,

640
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:09,806
and I saw you hadn't moved in a while,

641
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:11,352
and I figured maybe...

642
00:39:11,355 --> 00:39:14,286
- Let's not get misty-eyed.
- Yep. No problem.

643
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:16,264
No problem.

644
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:20,061
Alice said her thugs didn't jump me,

645
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,968
which means there is someone else

646
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:24,839
who doesn't want me knowing the
truth about the DNA on the knife.

647
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:27,063
Yeah. Well, just so you know,

648
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:28,658
while you're figuring that out,

649
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:32,004
you're getting a whole lot of
people excited over nothing.

650
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:45,945
Get rid of it.

651
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,799
It'll be melted it into a paperweight.

652
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:51,674
Destroy the masks while you're at it.

653
00:39:51,677 --> 00:39:54,671
I'll take care of whatever
surveillance was in the garage.

654
00:39:54,674 --> 00:39:56,457
Like it never happened.

655
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,490
Luke was right, Bruce.

656
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:07,491
Gotham needed something to believe in.

657
00:40:07,494 --> 00:40:10,350
They wanted hope just as
I started to lose mine.

658
00:40:10,353 --> 00:40:13,906
I spent half my life
looking for my sister,

659
00:40:13,908 --> 00:40:16,367
and today, I found someone else,

660
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:19,203
someone I didn't know or recognize.

661
00:40:19,205 --> 00:40:21,848
For the first time in 15 years,

662
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,051
I felt something other than hope.

663
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,905
I felt doubt.

664
00:40:35,364 --> 00:40:39,695
You're gonna tell me
everything you know about Alice.

665
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:42,086
Thought you were Batman.

666
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:43,848
You wish.

667
00:40:45,163 --> 00:40:46,671
Unh!

668
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:51,194
It may have taken you years,

669
00:40:51,196 --> 00:40:55,491
sweet, darling Kate, but
you found me eventually...

670
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,413
Even if I'm not the girl
you expected me to be.

671
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:08,586
I had my secrets just as you have yours,

672
00:41:08,588 --> 00:41:12,382
but do be careful, my dear sister.

673
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:15,558
Putting on that suit
and all the darkness

674
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:18,709
that comes with it...

675
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:23,971
Makes you just as crazy as me.

676
00:41:23,974 --> 00:41:27,576
