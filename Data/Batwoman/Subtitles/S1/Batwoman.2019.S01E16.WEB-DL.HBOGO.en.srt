1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,920
So, the monster who ripped this
family apart all those years ago

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,120
has brought us all back together.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,680
Irony, you are one sick bitch.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,240
And you, my darling sister,
are my hero.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,920
We're finally putting Cartwright
to rest.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,480
Knock it off
or your hands go back in the cuffs.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,360
Take a load off, Daddy.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,240
Farewell, Mr. Caterpillar.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,240
Give my regards
to the Queen of Hearts.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,560
How you holding up?

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
I'm not sure I am.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,960
Kate, do not waste
your guilt on that man.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,600
He does not deserve it.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,720
So, we just pretend
it never happened?

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,520
Tried it, doesn't work.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,040
Let's be honest.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,640
Your brief sojourn into my hellscape

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,280
is but a flicker of my
every waking day for so many years.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,840
Now, my Mouse is out in the world
alone, battling his greatest fears.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,080
I need to find him.

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,480
We find him together.

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,240
I think we have very different ideas

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,960
about what happens to Mouse
after we find him, so...

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,760
Alice, stop. I cannot let you...

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,320
But you can.

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,080
It is amazing how distracted you get

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,400
when you find out
that both your daughters are killers.

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,960
Oh, a friendly reminder.

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,320
Your DNA and your DNA
is all over that body in the ground.

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,680
So, it's probably best that you
let me slink back into the shadows

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,880
where nobody has to hear about this.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,280
Family reunion's over.

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,680
I never see you again. Understood?

34
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,440
Admit it, Batty.
Guys like me give you purpose.

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,080
Never again.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,480
Do you understand?

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Go!

38
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Go.

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,320
<i>My dad wants me to put
Cartwright behind me.</i>

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,280
<i>But it's not that easy.</i>

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,320
{\an5}<i>I went to a dark place, Bruce.</i>

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,520
<i>To avenge Beth, Alice, my mom.</i>

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,120
{\an5}<i>But in saving my sister,
I became more like her.</i>

44
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,360
{\an5}<i>And in taking out a killer</i>

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,360
{\an5}<i>I became one myself.</i>

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,160
{\an5}<i>What does that make me now?</i>

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Any luck last night?

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,480
- With?
- Finding Cartwright?

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,680
Because I've got nothing on him
or any of his aliases,

50
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,080
{\an5}and the thought of Beth's killers
still being out there...

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,440
Just tell me you found something.

52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,600
Nothing on this end either.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

54
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Bad news?

55
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
{\an5}It's my mom.

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,240
{\an5}Reggie Harris' post-conviction relief
hearing was moved up.

57
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
{\an5}Reggie Harris.

58
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,440
{\an5}The guy that killed your dad?

59
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,840
{\an5}When did it get moved up to?

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
Today.

61
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,080
{\an5}- Well, I'll come with you.
- No. There's no need for that.

62
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,400
{\an5}Harris was found at Sip and Dash
with the murder weapon

63
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,920
{\an5}and my dad's blood all over him.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,120
{\an5}So, what's there to review?

65
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,600
- Luke...
- Kate, seriously, I'm fine.

66
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,880
If you wanna be helpful,
find Cartwright, okay?

67
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,920
Mouse? Have you returned home?

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Hello?

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,200
Evil henchmen? Is anybody there?

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,880
What a curious plan.

71
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,320
Who did this?

72
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,960
{\an5}I got four cameras' worth of footage
missing from the Sip and Dash

73
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,760
{\an5}on the night Lucius Fox was murdered

74
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,040
and a 50,000 dollar cleanup fee

75
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,440
{\an5}sent from the Crows to Alia Nazari,
the Sip and Dash owner.

76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,720
You think the Crows paid Nazari
to lose the tapes?

77
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Who?

78
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,240
That's what I need you to figure out.

79
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
I don't trust anyone else to look
into it.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,080
You must be scraping
the bottom of the barrel, sir.

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,720
You suspended me for lying.

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,800
I still haven't changed my opinion
on Batwoman.

83
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,080
{\an5}I think we can both agree that this

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
{\an5}is bigger
than two different opinions.

85
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,720
{\an5}There should have been footage
of Fox's murder.

86
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
There wasn't.

87
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,040
{\an5}Let me see if I can meet with Nazari
and get her side of the story.

88
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,360
This has to stay between us.

89
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,480
Consider me back on payroll.

90
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Hey.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,320
I got your text last night.

92
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
<i>Late.</i>

93
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,160
<i>Like up-when-you-shouldn't-be late.</i>

94
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,080
Just checking in to make sure
you're good.

95
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,080
<i>Your mother was a beautiful woman.</i>

96
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,280
It would've been a pity for her
to go to waste.

97
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,240
<i>You stole everything from me!</i>

98
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
<i>Kate.</i>

99
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,160
You missed a spot.

100
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,040
What are you doing here?

101
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,960
Oh, I've come to ask for your
assistance in locating someone.

102
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Let me guess.

103
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
You needed help finding the guy

104
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,680
who put Dad in jail
and killed Catherine.

105
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,760
Both done at my request.

106
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,160
Didn't he also try to kill you?

107
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,480
And yet I still forgive him.

108
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,840
Choosing to see the best in him.

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
Ever tried that?

110
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,800
All the time. Never works out.

111
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,160
When I was dosed with fear toxin,
I relived all my worst fears.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,880
If Daddy hadn't saved me,
there's no telling

113
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,520
what I would've done to myself

114
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,400
or anyone else
to make the horror end.

115
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,320
- The Crows will find him.
- The Crows won't hesitate

116
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,720
to put a bullet in his head.

117
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,560
You don't want another death
on your hands.

118
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,200
I want you to leave, Alice.

119
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,080
That is precisely the plan.

120
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,920
Once I find Mouse, I will flee
this wretched city for good.

121
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,440
Why should I believe you?

122
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,240
My cats and rabbits are dead.

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,920
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,800
Let's just say subtlety
is not a defining characteristic

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,480
of someone I wronged in the past.

126
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Who?

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,520
Careful, Kate,
you're starting to sound interested.

128
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,760
Just help me and you will never
have to deal with me again.

129
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Fine.

130
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,680
But on one condition.

131
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,880
We do it my way.

132
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,480
Considering your way

133
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,680
involved strangling a man
until he choked

134
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,040
to death on his own blood,

135
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,400
I would love absolutely nothing more.

136
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Kate, everything okay?

137
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,600
I thought I'd offer a hand
in the search for Mouse.

138
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,040
<i>Oh, we got our bases covered.</i>

139
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,520
Take a load off, kiddo.

140
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,760
- Get some sleep.
- I'd sleep better if I knew

141
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
there were one less lunatic
on the streets of Gotham.

142
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,800
Yeah. You and me, both.

143
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,240
Mouse attacked a nurse
outside of Arkham last night.

144
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,040
<i>- Nearly killed her.</i>
- Arkham?

145
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,840
Why would he go back there?

146
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,520
Well, we'll figure it out.

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Get some rest.

148
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,520
<i>- I'll call you when we get him.</i>
- Thanks.

149
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,880
Why is Mouse attacking nurses
outside Arkham?

150
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,200
He lived there for years.

151
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,560
A real fan favorite.

152
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,480
The warden, Dr. Butler,

153
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,960
an all-around vile waste
of a soothing voice,

154
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,240
used him as a guinea pig.

155
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,560
Subject Mouse to fear toxin,
gauge its effects

156
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,000
and have the nurses pull him
out of it.

157
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,120
And then start all over again
the next day.

158
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,080
Do you think that Mouse
is still feeling the toxin?

159
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,280
Cartwright dosed him for days.

160
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I'm still...

161
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,680
shaking off the effects
after only one afternoon.

162
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,920
I can only imagine the hell he's in.

163
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,360
Maybe he's looking for someone
to pull him back out of it.

164
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,640
Someone like one of his former
nurses.

165
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,880
What are you doing?

166
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,760
Just checking to see
if we're the same size.

167
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Why?

168
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,280
I do the talking.

169
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Go ahead.

170
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,080
- Hello?
- Hi.

171
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,240
I'm Agent Kane and we're with the
undercover unit of Crows Security.

172
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,720
- Oh. I'm not in trouble, am I?
- No. But you could be in danger.

173
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,240
We're looking for one of your former
patients. Jonathan Cartwright.

174
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Goes by Mouse.

175
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Mouse?

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,920
Yes. He's a sweet boy,
but beyond help, sadly.

177
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, that's so sad.

178
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,800
We got word that he might
be coming here.

179
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Here? He's locked away at Arkham.

180
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,960
He escaped last year.

181
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,480
And we think that he's been targeting
his former nurses.

182
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,280
Do you mind if we wait inside,
so we can grab him if he comes?

183
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,840
Please. Come in.

184
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,840
Can I offer you anything?

185
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,480
Just finished making some brownies.

186
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,600
- We're good.
- A brownie would be nice.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Seriously?

188
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,000
We buried a body this morning,
when did you have time to eat?

189
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,320
All rise.

190
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,600
The court is now in session.

191
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,880
The honorable Judge Wellington
presiding.

192
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
You may be seated.

193
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,640
This is the case
of the <i>People vs. Reggie Harris.</i>

194
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
What are you doing here?

195
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,760
I heard about what was happening
today.

196
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,080
And I appreciate
the whole I-need-to-be-alone thing,

197
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,080
but as someone
whose parent was just murdered

198
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,240
and the killer was never brought
to justice,

199
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,960
alone is not where you need
to be right now.

200
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Thanks.

201
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,920
Where's your mom?

202
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,200
She barely made it to the funeral.

203
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,920
Imagine her being in the same room
as my dad's killer.

204
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,240
Mrs. Nazari?

205
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,160
Mrs. Nazari, it's Sophie Moore.

206
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,400
Couldn't have rigged that
to be any closer, could we, love?

207
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,800
What the hell just happened?

208
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,280
I work
with Special Reconnaissance Regiment.

209
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,760
We intercepted a communique someone

210
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,800
was offering a handsome bounty for
your head.

211
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,880
When I saw your name, I came calling.

212
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,080
We need to get out of here.

213
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,680
Sorry, how do you know my name?

214
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,160
You're Kate Kane's ex, right?

215
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,400
Well, so am I.

216
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,280
Julia Pennyworth. How do you do?

217
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,000
And I'm happy to tell you everything
I know, but,

218
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,680
can we deal with this first?

219
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,320
- You sure you don't want any?
- Positive.

220
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
More for me.

221
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,920
Are you trying to draw attention?

222
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,320
Who? Me?

223
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,960
- Wanna try?
- Nope.

224
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,440
It's really fun?

225
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,360
Because you can't,

226
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
and you don't want to admit that

227
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,400
I'm better at something than
you.

228
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,840
Exactly, Alice.

229
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,520
<i>Nurse Tammy!</i>

230
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
He's here.

231
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,960
- My poor Mouse.
- Get the adrenaline.

232
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
Nurse Tammy!

233
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Please.

234
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
What are they doing here?

235
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,120
- Did you call them?
- No.

236
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
- Do not lie to me.
- When would I have called them?

237
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,560
- I've literally not left your sight.
- Get out of my way.

238
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Alice, stop. You go out there,
they will shoot you too.

239
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,960
Don't you move.

240
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Hands in the air.

241
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,520
Take him to Arkham.

242
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,880
How did they know he was
here?

243
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,920
I called the Crows.

244
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,880
All that time spent working in the
asylum, you think I can't

245
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,280
- Kate are you in there?
- spot someone who's

246
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,400
- Crows. Open up!
- selling me a story?

247
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,520
There he was, in our grasp,
yanked away by might.

248
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,840
But what's lost is not gone.

249
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,040
Whatever this is,
I want nothing to do with it.

250
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,400
When I was under
the influence of fear toxin,

251
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,160
of all the horrible
things I experienced,

252
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,360
the worst was being left behind.

253
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
By you.

254
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,960
I cannot sleep at night
knowing I left Mouse behind

255
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,440
locked in a cell.

256
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,720
You wanna break him out.

257
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,920
Yes. And you are going to help me.

258
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,160
We just took out an old lady,

259
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm pretty sure that sister bonding
time is over.

260
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,440
It'll be a breeze.

261
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,120
When Mouse escaped last year,

262
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,000
he showed me all the ways
in and out of this place.

263
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,280
Sounds like you already have a plan,
so why do you need me?

264
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,400
As a recent escapee,
Mouse will be deemed high-risk.

265
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,600
Protocol will demand
that he be confined

266
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
to the most secure area,

267
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,960
the basement.

268
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,560
<i>Far away from the other inmates.</i>

269
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,840
<i>Where your screams
echo against the walls,</i>

270
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,840
<i>until one day,
they become a friend screaming back.</i>

271
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,520
Please. No, no, no. Come on.

272
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,800
Welcome back, Johnny.

273
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,360
We missed you.

274
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,840
I look forward to resuming your
therapy.

275
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Please.

276
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,120
- Not that again.
- Oh, no, no.

277
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,080
<i>There will be no escape for Mouse.</i>

278
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,520
<i>Access to his cell requires two keys.</i>

279
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,040
<i>The first is in the possession of
Dr. Butler.</i>

280
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,040
<i>The other stays
with the head of security.</i>

281
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,720
Which is why you need me.

282
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
Two keys, two different places.

283
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Two people.

284
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,800
You and me, sis.

285
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,600
Helping you find Mouse so

286
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,000
that you could leave Gotham
is one thing.

287
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,560
You're talking about breaking into
a high-security psychiatric facility,

288
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,240
distracting the guards,
and skirting the medical staff.

289
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,560
Oh and freeing a wanted killer
from captivity.

290
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,000
Does that sound insane?

291
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,960
I'm pretty sure it's a definition.

292
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,320
How fond she is
of finding morals in things.

293
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,240
I have to draw the line somewhere.

294
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,640
Yeah, but who arbitrarily decides

295
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,920
when and where those lines are drawn?
You?

296
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,560
Mouse is in custody. If I were
to help you break him out of there,

297
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,800
then how am I any better?

298
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,600
Don't you get it by now?

299
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,600
You're not.

300
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
I'm not a criminal.

301
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
And they say I'm the delusional one.

302
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,080
Here we are, two killers ourselves,

303
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,000
out and about
by the mercy of sweet old Daddy.

304
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,160
We aren't that different.

305
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,720
I never planned on hurting
Cartwright.

306
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,360
But I did.

307
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,160
See, I could have easily killed
him myself

308
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
and let you go on
being the city's symbol of hope.

309
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,280
But it was time for you to see
that you and I are one and the same.

310
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,560
You wanted this.

311
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,040
You left Cartwright for me to find.

312
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,960
You wanted me to hear your story.

313
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
You wanted to push me over the edge.

314
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,600
You set me up to kill him
so that I would be like you.

315
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,440
Kate, you can't give me all the
credits.

316
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,160
After all, it wasn't that hard.

317
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,680
You gonna kill me now too?

318
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,760
The court has reviewed
the defendant's case.

319
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,840
It's gonna be okay.

320
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,160
Judge Calverick has already signed
a statement indicating he cut corners

321
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,640
in order to close the
high-profile murder of Lucius Fox.

322
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,240
That, along with the defendant's
claims of a coerced confession

323
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,920
at the hands of a corrupt cop,

324
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,640
leads the court to believe that the
defendant has a basis for a retrial.

325
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
No way.

326
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,680
The state has the right to retry the
case at the DA's discretion.

327
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,960
Until then, the defendant
is free of his own volition.

328
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,880
This court is adjourned.

329
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,920
We're gonna fight this.
This is not over, okay?

330
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
I know.

331
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,040
Battle not with monsters,
lest you become a monster.

332
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,080
I'm afraid that passage wasn't
in the one book

333
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,560
I was allowed to read.

334
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,800
Someone once said it to me.

335
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,640
How did that work out?

336
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,520
I became a monster.

337
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I know I've made light of things...

338
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,440
but I owe you a thank you.

339
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,640
Thank you for killing the man

340
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,000
who destroyed my life...

341
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,760
destroyed our family.

342
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,880
Do not feel guilty for what you did.

343
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
I... I don't.

344
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,840
The only thing I feel guilty about...

345
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,720
is that I don't feel guilty.

346
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,680
So now, you're scared
you're becoming me.

347
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,080
Isn't that what you wanted?

348
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,680
Would that really be so awful?

349
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
I'll do it.

350
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
I'll do it.

351
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,560
I'll reunite you with Mouse.

352
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,600
But I need to be able to trust you.

353
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Okay.

354
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Say it.

355
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,960
You can trust me, Kate.

356
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,840
No one dies in the process.

357
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,240
Kate, have I ever lied to you?

358
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,800
Literally dozens of times.

359
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,840
Yeah, okay.

360
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
I promise...

361
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,840
no... one...

362
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,560
will die.

363
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,320
You can trust me.

364
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,160
What's this?

365
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,080
Well, we're breaking a killer
out of Arkham,

366
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,400
so you can't exactly go in
disguised as a flying rodent.

367
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
ID, please.

368
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Code black.

369
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,160
Repeat! Code black!

370
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,960
Hands where I can see them.

371
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
What's going on?

372
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,240
Possible incendiary device
at the main gate.

373
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,000
Slowly exit the vehicle. Now!

374
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,000
That should be the guards
responding to our little decoy.

375
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,800
- Alice, if they shoot that driver...
- Oh, relax, he drives a linen truck.

376
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,560
Guards finding a fake bomb
on the axle

377
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,040
could be the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to him.

378
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,640
Well, that should take us up
to the maximum security wing.

379
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,920
Don't forget this.

380
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,640
Once we pop the cork on this bunny,
things are going to get crazy.

381
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
We're clear.

382
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,160
I'll get the keys from Dr. Butler.

383
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,520
And I'll get the keys
from the head guard.

384
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
Wait.

385
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,760
Remember your promise.

386
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
No killing.

387
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,520
You can trust me.

388
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,240
The doctor's not in, so...

389
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
you get me.

390
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Careful.

391
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,560
I can take a hit, love,

392
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,760
but it's the clean-up after
that I've never been good with.

393
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,280
This is probably a good time for me
to say thank you.

394
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
It comes with the paycheck.

395
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,600
- Hi.
- Mary. Hey.

396
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,920
- We could use your help.
- Oh, my god.

397
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,880
I've met you before.

398
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,800
- You're Kate's...
- Ex.

399
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,200
I know. We covered that.

400
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,240
I was gonna say assistant,
but that's much more fun.

401
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,080
Julia will suffice.
British Intelligence, SRR.

402
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,880
Julia took a bullet that was meant
for me.

403
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,880
Which leaves the question,
who wants me dead?

404
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,360
Who's the other vic?

405
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,760
Witness in the case. Alia Nazari.

406
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,440
Someone's cleaning up their tracks.

407
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,200
I could not see outside, you know?

408
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
All this time, Mom,

409
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
- I'm telling you.
- Right.

410
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,800
- No, you didn't. No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. Yes.

411
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,000
- You didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

412
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,640
You know I'm gonna eat them all.

413
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,200
I will. I will do whatever...

414
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Go on inside.

415
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I'll be right in.

416
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,160
You murdered my father.

417
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
I didn't.

418
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,000
I am sorry somebody did.

419
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,040
- Your pops seemed like a good guy.
- Don't do that.

420
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,360
Don't act like you knew the first
thing about my dad.

421
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,520
I know he was proud of you.

422
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,520
Getting into MIT.

423
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,400
How the hell did you know that?

424
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
You kidding?

425
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,080
Your pops wouldn't shut up about it.

426
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,280
Told everybody
in the store that night.

427
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,920
"My son, Lucas, is gonna
change the world.

428
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,560
You heard it here first."

429
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,760
Then why did you kill him, man?

430
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
The truth is,

431
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,960
I went into a Sip and
Dash for a bag of chips.

432
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,520
I woke up with a gun in my hand,

433
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
your dad's...

434
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,600
Your dad's blood all over me.

435
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,480
Look at me.

436
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,080
Tats, dreads, record?

437
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,680
Of course, I'm gonna convince a jury
I killed Lucius Fox.

438
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
I was the winning lottery ticket

439
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,320
for a bunch of punks who needed
to keep their own ass out of jail.

440
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,520
Hey, Reggie.

441
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,840
Help! Help!

442
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,440
Dr. Butler, I presume.

443
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,120
You're supposed to be dead.

444
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,240
You know, it's funny
how this place can make people feel

445
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,680
like they're losing their minds.

446
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,840
Even you, doctor.

447
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,520
What... what do you want?

448
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,680
I have long dreamed of meeting you.

449
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,920
Repaying you for all the pain...

450
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,720
you inflicted on a...

451
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,040
dear friend.

452
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,080
One quick swipe,...

453
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,240
another name off my list.

454
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,360
But a promise is a promise.

455
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,480
Now, where are your keys?

456
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,480
Thank you.

457
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,120
You'll live.

458
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,960
<i>Legs crossed
You're messing with the best now</i>

459
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,680
<i>You're messing with the best now
You're messing with the</i>

460
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,880
<i>You're messing with the best now</i>

461
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,040
<i>Legs crossed
Messing with the best now</i>

462
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,080
<i>You're messing with the best now
You're messing with the best</i>

463
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,120
<i>You're messing with the best now
You're messing with the best now</i>

464
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,760
<i>You like a fight
when your friend's near</i>

465
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,880
<i>Now, you're alone,
You lay low because you smell fear</i>

466
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,920
<i>I left my conscience burning
in the tarmac</i>

467
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,760
<i>Load my ammo, click it back
Bang, bang! And attack, yeah!</i>

468
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,280
<i>You're messing with the best now
You're messing with the best now</i>

469
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,200
<i>You're messing with the best now</i>

470
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,640
Alice! Knife!

471
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,280
<i>You're messing with the best now
You're messing with the best now</i>

472
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,640
<i>You're messing with the best now</i>

473
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,840
<i>You're messing with the best now</i>

474
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,320
Guess you do know how to use it.

475
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,120
<i>You're messing with the best now</i>

476
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,040
<i>You're messing with the best now</i>

477
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,680
<i>Hush, hush, legs crossed
You're messing with the best now</i>

478
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Mouse.

479
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
It's me.

480
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,960
Alice?

481
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,520
What are you doing here?

482
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,880
You know I'd never leave you behind.

483
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,000
They don't take any chances.

484
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,600
Why are there so many straps?

485
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,520
Kate, help me.

486
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,920
What are you doing?

487
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,040
Open the door.

488
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,880
Open the door.

489
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,280
I can't do that, Alice.

490
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,160
You...

491
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,400
You promised.

492
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,960
I promised to reunite you with Mouse.

493
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,600
You wanted to be with your brother.

494
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Now you are.

495
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,840
Why did you trust her?

496
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,800
It's over, Alice.

497
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,240
You can't hurt anyone anymore.

498
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,960
Me?

499
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,120
You are no better than me.

500
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
And you?

501
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,000
You and I are the same person.

502
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,640
We are no different.

503
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,080
Let's get out of here.

504
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,240
No.

505
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,480
No, no, no.

506
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,840
No.

507
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,240
No, no, no.

508
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,440
Kate, don't leave me.

509
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,760
Don't leave me. No, no, no.

510
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,760
No, Kate, no.

511
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,160
No. No.

512
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,120
No, no, no!

513
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,640
No, Kate, don't leave me.

514
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,960
Don't leave me.

515
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,960
Don't leave me.

516
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,120
No! Kate! Kate!

517
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,480
Don't leave me! No!

518
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,480
Arkham officials have her in
isolation on 24-hour watch.

519
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,240
Getting her to trust you,
alerting me, helping your city,

520
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,360
it wasn't easy.

521
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,760
Took a hell of a lot of courage.

522
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,720
It had to be done

523
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,240
and I had to be the one to do it.

524
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
I...

525
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,600
I moved the body.

526
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,760
She can't threaten us anymore.

527
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
It's time

528
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,560
to put Alice behind us.

529
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
Kiddo.

530
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,920
<i>We will fight turn the tide</i>

531
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,280
<i>In this world of darkness</i>

532
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Oh, my god.

533
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,760
Luke, are you hurt?

534
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,040
Let me take a look at you.

535
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
It's Reggie's.

536
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,840
What do you mean it's Reggie's?

537
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,120
I went to go confront him,
but someone shot him.

538
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,640
- Who?
-I don't... I didn't... I didn't see.

539
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,480
GCPD thinks it was a hit.
Professional.

540
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,120
Reggie gets shot
the day he gets released from prison?

541
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,800
Earlier today, Alia Nazari was shot.

542
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Who?

543
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,240
The woman who owned the Sip and Dash
where your father was killed.

544
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,720
It was a professional hit too.

545
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,440
Why would anybody wanna kill her?

546
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Nazari obviously knew something

547
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,200
that someone didn't want her
to spill.

548
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,120
Luke.

549
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,280
I think there's a chance
that Reggie didn't kill your father.

550
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,960
Yeah. After everything
that's happened today, I...

551
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,080
I don't really know what to believe.

552
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,400
If Reggie was set up...

553
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,320
Then my dad's killer's still out
there.

554
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,040
<i>We will rise like raging fire</i>

555
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,880
Reggie Harris' freedom
was short-lived today

556
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,160
when he was gunned down
outside of his home

557
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,440
just a handful of hours
after he was released from prison.

558
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,360
<i>Harris, who had previously been
convicted of manslaughter,</i>

559
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,560
<i>has long proclaimed his innocence.</i>

560
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,920
<i>His case was currently awaiting...</i>

561
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,440
- No frills,
- <i>one of many cases that...</i>

562
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,240
but no questions either.

563
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,360
We'll be safe here.

564
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,920
Guy claims he was set up for murder

565
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,680
then gets killed the day
of his release.

566
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,720
Well, that's no coincidence.

567
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,280
This cover-up I've been looking into?

568
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,160
It's centered around Lucius Fox's
murder.

569
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,560
Lucius Fox?

570
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Know him?

571
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,280
He was my godfather.

572
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,040
We'll figure out who's behind this.

573
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,920
Where you are going?

574
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,480
I need to check on Luke.

575
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,040
Calling from a burner phone.

576
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,640
That's never a good sign.

577
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,320
You were right about the Crows,

578
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,320
but it goes beyond tampering
with evidence.

579
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,400
<i>Someone took out two people today
and they put a hit out on me too.</i>

580
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,160
Who hired you?

581
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,680
<i>This is what you wanted</i>

582
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,200
<i>Right?
At least that's what I thought</i>

583
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,720
Someone's aiming to see double
tonight.

584
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,240
Didn't realize you were in town.

585
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,200
Came by to check on Luke,
saw you out here.

586
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,720
But it looks like I've walked in
on a party of one.

587
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,440
I'd like to keep it that way, if you
don't mind.

588
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,680
Sorry, love...

589
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
I do.

590
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
You don't have to say anything,

591
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,240
but a friend wouldn't leave
you drinking on a ledge.

592
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,960
<i>Hardest time
When all you see is the tide</i>

593
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,280
<i>Going in and out</i>

594
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,240
I'm not the hero this city thinks
I am.

595
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,200
I betrayed my sister today.

596
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Put her in Arkham.

597
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,600
What compelled that?

598
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,440
I felt myself becoming her.

599
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,960
I killed someone.

600
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
Buried him.

601
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,880
I didn't feel an ounce of remorse.

602
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,720
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

603
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,480
I don't know who I am right now...

604
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,560
<i>I'm strong enough to hold my own</i>

605
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,360
But I do know
that I do not wanna be my sister.

606
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,960
<i>Keeping my head above water</i>

607
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,720
You are nothing like your sister.

608
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,000
"It was a glorious victory,
wasn't it?"

609
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,480
said the White Knight.

610
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,800
"I don't know,"
Alice said doubtfully.

611
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,800
"I don't want to be anybody's
prisoner.

612
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,160
I want to be a queen."
