1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
<i>Dear Kate...</i>

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,720
<i>It doesn't feel real to say goodbye.</i>

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>Unbeknownst to us,
Julia Pennyworth spent months</i>

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,680
<i>with a recovery team
combing the ocean floor</i>

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,960
<i>for any sign of you.</i>

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,240
<i>She found something caught,
a parietal skull bone</i>

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,960
<i>in the shores outside of Bludhaven,</i>

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,560
<i>had three different labs match it
to your DNA.</i>

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,640
<i>It was enough to confirm
you were gone</i>

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,080
<i>and since I can't exactly
be there to say</i>

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,520
<i>goodbye in person, I'll say it here</i>

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,080
<i>in the place where I feel like
I know you the best</i>

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,080
<i>and since I can't lay flowers
at your gravesite either,</i>

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>I have another idea.</i>

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,360
<i>This plant was my connection
to my mama.</i>

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,600
<i>Then it turned out to be
more than a plant.</i>

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,640
<i>It's a desert rose from Coryana</i>

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,120
<i>probably snuck over to the states</i>

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,520
<i>by an islander named Ocean</i>

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,960
<i>who eventually gave it
to my ex for safekeeping</i>

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,000
<i>who then gave it to me,
having no idea that its serum</i>

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,760
<i>was actually a miracle cure.</i>

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,600
<i>Like you, this plant is one of a kind</i>

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,480
<i>and like you, it gave me
a second chance.</i>

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,920
Beyond all earthly words
and songs of blessing,

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,480
praise and comfort.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,440
<i>So now when I look at it,
I won't just think of my mama</i>

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,360
<i>I'll think of Kate Kane.</i>

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,640
<i>I'll think of the woman who saved
a hell of a lot of people</i>

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,880
<i>the woman who created
a family for everyone</i>

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,440
<i>the woman who would keep us
from surrendering to our demons,</i>

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,600
<i>the woman who inspired people
to stay true to themselves</i>

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,360
<i>even when it felt impossible</i>

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,840
<i>to always be there
whenever someone needed them</i>

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,800
<i>who brought out our humanity,
even in the darkest of moments</i>

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,280
<i>and the woman who changed me.</i>

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,840
<i>Like everything good in my life</i>

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,040
<i>I thought my time
as the bat was temporary</i>

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
<i>but it's for real now</i>

40
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,640
<i>and I'm not in your shadow anymore.</i>

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
<i>I'm it.</i>

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,760
<i>I am Batwoman.</i>

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,960
<i>Goodbye, Kate Kane.</i>

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,360
<i>Thank you for changing my life.</i>

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,080
<i>May your memory be a blessing.</i>

46
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,000
May her memory be a blessing.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,040
May her memory be a blessing.

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,800
Your family has declared
you dead, Kate Kane...

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,360
But sit tight.

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,600
We'll make them believe
in life after death.

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,520
{\an5}- Rolling?
- Okay. Here they come.

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,840
{\an5}Nice and tight on Forbes, please.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Commissioner Forbes, it's not news

54
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,840
that the GCPD
has been working tirelessly

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,560
to put snakebite dealers behind bars,

56
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,920
but it's now rumored you're getting
your help from Batwoman.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
{\an5}- Can you comment?
- There's no question

58
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,720
{\an5}we will put a stop to Snakebite

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,320
{\an5}and its manufacturers,
the False Face Society.

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,560
But this drug,
it has its teeth in people.

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,040
{\an5}It's addictive,
it's sexy and it's lethal.

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,560
The last I checked, Dana, the GCPD

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,560
was never one to turn down
a little extra help

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
from a vigilante.

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,240
{\an5}Now I have a ten-hour
budget meeting to get to.

66
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,360
I'm actually here to talk about
that budget meeting, commissioner.

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
{\an5}Oh, goody. Let me guess...

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,360
{\an5}You want to defund the police.

69
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Defunding the police
means reducing your budget

70
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,320
in areas like officer bonuses
and cannabis regulation

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,280
and redistributing the funds
to things like mental health

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,960
{\an5}education, employment, housing.

73
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
{\an5}Where do you think
the money comes from

74
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
{\an5}every time we have to
clean a building

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
{\an5}you and your friends graffiti tag?

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,480
{\an5}Got it. So spray paint
will get your attention

77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,480
{\an5}but not your own officers
killing four unarmed black men

78
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,400
{\an5}- this year alone?
- It's an elected position, sweetie.

79
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,440
{\an5}You don't like me? Run.

80
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Right?

81
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,880
{\an5}I've never had sweet potato
pancakes before

82
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,640
but if I had

83
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,320
these would be my favorite.

84
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
{\an5}It's all about the skillet.

85
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,720
{\an5}Thank you for this

86
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,840
{\an5}and for letting me cry
at odd hours of the day

87
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,920
{\an5}and letting me finish
all the ice cream in the freezer.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,840
{\an5}I'm gonna need that
replaced actually.

89
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
No way.

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
{\an5}These past few weeks, you know,

91
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,040
{\an5}have been really, really tough.

92
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,160
{\an5}But somehow, it all feels
a little less awful

93
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
{\an5}when you're around

94
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,920
{\an5}and I know Luke feels it too

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
so thank you.

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,520
You and Luke

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
you saved my life.

98
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,320
{\an5}We have to take care of each other.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
{\an5}Yeah.

100
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Got it.

101
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,480
- It smells so good in here.
- Yeah.

102
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Ang?

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,120
What are you doing here?

104
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,600
Didn't mean to interrupt,

105
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,200
but I did, so I was
hoping we could talk.

106
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,920
There's nothing left to talk about.

107
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
{\an5}Well, then maybe just listen

108
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,200
{\an5}because I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

109
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,160
{\an5}Okay. I am gonna take this

110
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,280
{\an5}and these downstairs

111
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,520
{\an5}out of earshot...

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Maybe.

113
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,760
I... I said some

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,000
pretty awful things
to you a while back.

115
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,960
{\an5}Well, I mean, in your defense

116
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,800
{\an5}you were in the process
of dumping me.

117
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,280
{\an5}Ryan, you worked with the Crows
to lojack my phone.

118
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
Ok. I know you didn't just come
all this way to relive this...

119
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
I miss you.

120
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,560
You've always been my constant,

121
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,200
{\an5}and you made every
crappy group home

122
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,880
{\an5}feel like a real home.

123
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,160
And then Cora adopted you,

124
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,000
and I was, like, on my own, crushed

125
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,400
but happy for you.

126
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,520
I... I just couldn't
fight to keep you then,

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
but...

128
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,960
Now I can.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Ang...

130
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,440
I am moving forward in my life.

131
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
And as long as you keep
doing your thing

132
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,560
slinging Snakebite

133
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,560
we don't work.

134
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm getting out.

135
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,360
You said you couldn't get out.

136
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,800
No. I said I didn't want to

137
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,320
but False Face found out that Ocean

138
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
taught me how to make Snakebite.

139
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,720
And with Ocean M.I.A.,
they wanted me to open my own lab,

140
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,840
but I don't want to be
the Walter White of Gotham city.

141
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,160
I found someone

142
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,880
worth turning my life around for.

143
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,880
Just...

144
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Think about it

145
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,000
because I know
my mind is already made up.

146
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,320
Kate Kane sat on a wall.

147
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,280
Kate Kane had a great fall.

148
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,000
All the bat's gadgets
and all the bat's men

149
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,960
couldn't put Kate together again.

150
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
It's a pity you're coming
all the way from Coryana

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,200
just to die.

152
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,120
Should have figured
you were in here.

153
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm sorry. What is happening?

154
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,440
Don't be silly.
You invited me for tea.

155
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,640
We've got extra eyes!

156
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,880
Come on! We got to go!

157
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,080
We're coming for you!

158
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,040
Commissioner Forbes' chalk outline

159
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,560
represents one of the most
brazen criminal events

160
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,960
in recent Gotham history.

161
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,160
I'm joined by Janus cosmetics
CEO Roman Sionis.

162
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,440
Mr. Sionis, I understand
you have something

163
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,160
you'd like to say
to the Gotham public.

164
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,680
Yes. Thank you, Dana.
You know, it shouldn't take

165
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,280
a businessperson to step in here,

166
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,680
but I have made a career
out of concealing blemishes

167
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,960
and quite frankly,
the makeover this city needs

168
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,920
comes from an ugly
I've never seen before.

169
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,240
So, yes, I am here
to speak on behalf

170
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
of the people without a platform

171
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,320
like the hundreds who work for me

172
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,600
who say they're scared
to death, Dana.

173
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,120
They are scared to death
of the criminal element

174
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,160
lurking behind masks,
but I'm not here

175
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,000
to beg for help today.

176
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,520
I'm here to offer it.

177
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,320
To the law enforcement
in charge of protecting us,

178
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
what can we do?

179
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,960
How can we help you?

180
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,440
Because enough is enough.

181
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,960
The gangs in the city are stupid

182
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,240
but not kill the commissioner stupid.

183
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,000
It's common knowledge that
Forbes was having an affair.

184
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,920
I wouldn't eliminate
lady spite killing.

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,400
Or any recently released inmate

186
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,920
who may feel
like Forbes screwed them over.

187
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,320
License plates, facial rec.

188
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,840
Any vehicle that didn't
stop long enough

189
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,320
at a stoplight last night
gets put through the system.

190
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,680
- I don't get it.
- I thought he was gunned down

191
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,080
- on those steps.
- He was.

192
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,600
Where the hell's the commissioner?

193
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,440
There's nothing there.

194
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Hang on. Go back.

195
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,680
Check out the timestamp.

196
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Someone scrubbed five minutes
on both sides of the murder.

197
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,160
You got to be kidding me.

198
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,600
I want the name
of everyone in this city

199
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,200
with access to this feed.

200
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,800
So whoever shot the commissioner
has access to the city's CCTV.

201
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,640
This was a well-planned execution.

202
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,760
Wait. Rewind again.

203
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,880
Look at the far right after the jump.

204
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,920
- Someone tagged it.
- Can you get a closer angle at that?

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,120
- Yeah.
- Someone could have been

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,960
tagging the building
while the shooting was happening.

207
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
Then got the hell out of dodge,
left behind work in progress.

208
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,720
Which means the tagger
could have seen the shooter.

209
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,280
And the shooter could have seen them,
so how do we track down

210
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,520
a potential witness and protect them

211
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,800
solely off the words
"defund the police?"

212
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,320
- I think I found it.
- Literally how?

213
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,320
Social media. Figured the "x"

214
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,240
inside the "o" and monochrome
on top of the neon

215
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,000
was some sort of signature.

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,320
Definitely could be the same artist.

217
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I'll get the user's info.

218
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Hey!

219
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,120
So...

220
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
We just gonna act like Angelique

221
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,240
didn't come by yesterday, or...

222
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,800
- Yep.
- I thought that was over.

223
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,560
It was. Major dumper's remorse.

224
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
You were listening?

225
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,680
Well, you know, just in case
I had to step in and defend.

226
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,960
So spill. We taking her back?

227
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
I don't know.

228
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,360
I love her.

229
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,680
She's a huge part of my life.

230
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
But?

231
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Hey, I'm in.

232
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,520
So no real name.
It's someone's Finstad

233
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
but I matched the login information
to another profile.

234
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,840
Jordan Moore.

235
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,280
You don't think she's
any relation to...

236
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,560
Sir, where are you?

237
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,640
the commissioner was assassinated
and that pompous ass Roman Sionis

238
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120
is getting more airtime
then the Crows commander.

239
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,000
Maybe you should release
a statement or something.

240
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Call me!

241
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
what the actual hell?

242
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Jordan!

243
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,960
What is happening?

244
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,880
I saw Commissioner Forbes
get gunned down.

245
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,440
What?

246
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,840
Look. I... I didn't know
where else to go.

247
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,320
I'm... I'm scared to go home.

248
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,000
I feel like I'm being followed.

249
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,480
Hey, hey. I got you.

250
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,440
Everything's gonna be all right.

251
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,360
Let's go upstairs.

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,400
I'll take your witness statement.

253
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,840
Are you kidding me? I'm not giving
my name to the Crows.

254
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,640
I may as well just do
a sit-down with Vesper Fairchild.

255
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,040
Do you have any idea
what a huge deal this is?

256
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,560
There's no other witnesses.

257
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
I don't care.

258
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,640
The Crows don't keep people
like me safe and you know it.

259
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,200
I came to Sophie,
my sister, for help,

260
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,120
not Sophie the crow.

261
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,160
- Get down!
- Told you they were following me!

262
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,920
Who's they?
Now is when you pull your gun!

263
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Damn.

264
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,640
You're Batwoman.

265
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,160
It's False Face.

266
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,000
So the commissioner's
hot take on Snakebite

267
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,160
got his ass killed.

268
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,400
How did you know we were here?

269
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,960
Jordan wasn't at her place

270
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,960
so I hoped she went
to her sister for help.

271
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,480
Apparently False Face
had the same idea.

272
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,080
Sorry. How, how do you
know my life?

273
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,680
I've seen your skills around Gotham

274
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,760
and I know you were tagging
city hall last night.

275
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Seriously?

276
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,120
Girl, so not the point right now.

277
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,240
I need you to tell me
everything you saw.

278
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,360
You don't get it. I snitch,
it comes back to me.

279
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,800
They saw me there.
They'll know it was me.

280
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,400
The costume party
on the ground tells me.

281
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,800
They already know it was you.

282
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,280
You can trust her.

283
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,000
There were three dudes.

284
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,920
Two got out of the car
and gunned down Forbes,

285
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,760
one in a gas mask
and one in a hockey mask

286
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,600
- and then a driver.
- Was he wearing a mask?

287
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,680
She. Yes. A... a baby doll thing.

288
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,360
So it could be literally anyone.

289
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,840
It isn't enough.

290
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,760
You're off the hook.
Consider yourself lucky.

291
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,640
Don't know if it helps,
but I saw the driver's bracelet.

292
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,840
It was a big gold key.
It looked ritz.

293
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Everything OK?

294
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,280
Get her somewhere safe.

295
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
I'll figure this out.

296
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,520
You and your friend,
go tell your boss we're good here.

297
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,640
The girl will keep her mouth shut
and you will leave her alone.

298
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,560
You're not real, this tea's not real,

299
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,000
and this cup is...

300
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,360
- Not real.
- Correct, but...

301
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,880
You don't want reality.

302
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
That's the point.

303
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,280
No... I just spent the last two weeks

304
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,600
in the bowels of a ship

305
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,720
trying to escape
a godforsaken island.

306
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,320
Trust me.

307
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,880
If I were to conjure up some fantasy,

308
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,840
this would not be it.

309
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
You mean the same island
you risked everything

310
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,800
to get to in order to see me again?

311
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,400
Well, here we are.

312
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,920
Of course. I ask the universe
for my sister

313
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,680
and this is what I get.

314
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,280
I'm not sure why that's surprising.

315
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,600
You never get what you want.

316
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,800
Cheers to that.

317
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,480
Nothing about your plan
unfolded the way you wanted.

318
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,440
After we left you in this cell
for 11 years,

319
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,160
you set out to make sure your
family never left you again.

320
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,920
But Dad helped lock you
at Arkham and I'm dead.

321
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,240
Am I so mentally disturbed
that my imagination created you

322
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,680
to rub it in?

323
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,960
You created me because
you were always the one

324
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,160
who got us into trouble,

325
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,720
but I was always
the one clever enough

326
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
to get us out of it.

327
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,160
- What trouble?
- Your pain.

328
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,960
What if I told you I had a way
to make it disappear?

329
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,480
Ang, open up. It's me.

330
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Hey.

331
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,080
You said you were getting out, Ang!

332
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,240
Okay.

333
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,280
Your energy
is super intense right now.

334
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,480
Who killed the commissioner?

335
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,320
What were you thinking

336
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,960
driving the getaway car?

337
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Who else knows?

338
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,920
That is not the appropriate response
to what I just said.

339
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,320
You want me to end up dead?

340
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,520
- Who else knows?
- I do!

341
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
That should be enough!

342
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,360
I don't even know what
I was doing there.

343
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,640
I said I wanted out,
and they were willing to let me go

344
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,960
if I just did this one last thing.

345
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,160
They gave me a mask, keys
and an address.

346
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,680
Am I supposed to
believe you right now?

347
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,760
When have I ever lied to you?

348
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,960
If my name is out,
False Face will kill me

349
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,240
to protect themselves.

350
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,800
Then out them.

351
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,640
Turn in the actual killers.

352
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,440
Tell the court what you just told me.
You didn't know.

353
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,280
False Face is run by a psychopath
named Black Mask

354
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,200
who will leave me for dead in a sewer
before I ever get on a witness stand.

355
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,640
I can protect you.

356
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
You?

357
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
How?

358
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,120
This is going to sound...

359
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Insane...

360
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
But...

361
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,320
I know Batwoman.

362
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,880
How do you think I know
you got wrapped up in this crap?

363
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,880
You and your comic book heroes.

364
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,560
Yeah. Well, thanks to me
and my comic book heroes

365
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,280
your ass has an out

366
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,200
if you're willing to take it,

367
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,120
but you need to take it.

368
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,080
Can I think about it?

369
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,760
What do you mean
you're letting her think about it?

370
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,360
She just gunned down
the commissioner.

371
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,720
She drove the getaway car.

372
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,960
Oh, right.
She didn't pull the trigger.

373
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,080
She just stepped on the gas. Yes.

374
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
Please give her
all the time she needs.

375
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,920
Ryan's right. If Jordan testifies

376
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,320
against False Face, they'll kill her.

377
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,080
But if Angelique does,
Jordan doesn't have to.

378
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,200
Exactly. Ang just needs time.
She'll make the right decision.

379
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,480
She could have gone to the cops

380
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
when you were busted
for her drugs on you.

381
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,560
- She didn't.
- She's changed.

382
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,400
You literally just said the words,
"she drove the getaway car."

383
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Okay.

384
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,680
You have my back, right?

385
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,480
I've been down this road before
with another Batwoman... Kate...

386
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,120
and she found every excuse
in the book

387
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,760
to justify her twin sister's actions.

388
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,160
And you've always been
the one to remind me

389
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,680
that my mom died because of it.

390
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,520
Angelique is not Alice.

391
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,720
No one is ever Alice until they are
because someone let them be.

392
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,400
Maybe you don't have to wait
for Angelique to turn herself in.

393
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,920
You can do that for her.

394
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,040
You all are supposed to be my team.

395
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,960
What do you mean? We are your team,

396
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,840
which makes you our leader.

397
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,840
This is it. This is your chance
to make the right call.

398
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,960
I'll give Angelique an hour to talk,

399
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,640
but after that,
I'll call the cops myself.

400
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,080
No. I personally
never thought Safiyah

401
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,120
was responsible for
Kate's plane blowing up.

402
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
Not her M.O.

403
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,080
The NTSB concluded
that based on the weather

404
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,320
and the atmosphere, it was
likely a lightning strike

405
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,920
that knocked out the controls.

406
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,760
A recalled circuit breaker
could have sparked

407
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,400
an electrical fire in the cockpit.

408
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,440
I take it. I'm reading their report
because you don't believe that.

409
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
Over the last few months,
I've discovered

410
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,680
that one of my daughters
was Batwoman

411
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,600
while the other ran an
illegal underground medical clinic,

412
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,120
so I'm not taking anything
at face value anymore.

413
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Sir...

414
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,800
I... I can't even imagine

415
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
what you must be feeling
as a father right now,

416
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,760
but Kate would want
you to find peace.

417
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,560
Then eliminate each
and every one of her enemies

418
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,560
who could have done this
or find me the one who did

419
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,240
so I can kill him myself.

420
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,800
And... If I find nothing
that contradicts this report,

421
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,160
then will you please accept it
as what I believe it is?

422
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,000
A horrible and tragic accident?

423
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,800
Convince me I'm wrong

424
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,720
and I'll let this go.

425
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,840
This is your idea of a safe space?

426
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,000
I need a drink
and you only have expensive wine

427
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,120
I'm not allowed to look at.

428
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,960
You wouldn't even be
in any danger right now

429
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,000
if you hadn't been out tagging again.

430
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,880
It's how I express myself.

431
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,320
Then grab a notepad.

432
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
Defacing property is illegal.

433
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,440
Oh, my god.

434
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,040
Why did Batwoman have to save me?

435
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,680
I... I was having more fun
having a crowbar swung to my face.

436
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,360
Sounds like y'all could stand
to be less sober right now.

437
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,760
Two club sodas.

438
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,360
Vodka with a vodka back.

439
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,880
Ryan, this is
my little sister Jordan.

440
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,680
So you were saved by Batwoman.

441
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,960
- That's dope.
- Yeah. I mean, it was... Fine.

442
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Fine?

443
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,240
- It's Batwoman.
- Yeah.

444
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,560
But she's so... Cringe.

445
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,440
At least she ditched the party wig.

446
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,240
Harsh words for someone
who just saved your life.

447
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,800
- She's one of them.
- One of who?

448
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,760
Cops, Crows, the law.

449
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,280
Just another suit
who shoots first and asks later.

450
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,400
Okay...

451
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,360
Then...

452
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,000
How will you stop
Gotham's crime problem?

453
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Before it starts.

454
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,240
Currently, I'm working
with grassroots organizations

455
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,320
to get funding
for a community center off skid row.

456
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,720
I'm on a council to move money

457
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,600
to neighborhood-led
safety initiatives

458
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,000
and I phone bank
for no new jails in Gotham city.

459
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,000
This one's on the house.

460
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,480
She's... Passionate.

461
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
I can see that.

462
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Let's go.

463
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,360
Okay.

464
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
So... The vibes are there

465
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,120
and sis just came out of the closet.

466
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
What are you talking about?

467
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
This is me being your wing woman,

468
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
in case you missed it.

469
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,680
Mom told you?

470
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,720
Just because she needs to take
time with it

471
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,120
doesn't mean I do.

472
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
Thank you.

473
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,560
So...

474
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,800
Bartender chick? Fire.

475
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,680
Nope. Not happening.

476
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,520
Not even an enemies-to-lovers maybe.

477
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,240
You're gonna have to swipe right
on someone eventually.

478
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
I got to make a call.

479
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
Stay put.

480
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,280
Hey, I need you to ask
a favor of your associate.

481
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,400
She doesn't really do favors per se.

482
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,200
<i>I think Batwoman has intel
on a member of False Face.</i>

483
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,200
Perp, I'm looking into was wearing
some kind of key bracelet.

484
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,920
<i>Seemed to ring a bell with her.</i>

485
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Why not use the Crows?

486
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,960
It'll take forensics months.

487
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,720
Luke, False Face just
executed the commissioner

488
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,840
in cold blood because he
spoke out against Snakebite.

489
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
I'll see what I can do.

490
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,800
Why didn't you just tell her?

491
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,400
Because Ryan told us she's got this.

492
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,080
I know, but wouldn't
it just be easier

493
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,800
if Sophie handled it?

494
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,000
Angelique is Ryan's
lesbian Achilles heel.

495
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,800
She's not gonna
turn her over to the authorities

496
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,480
and this way,
we don't have to either.

497
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,440
We told Ryan we'd
hold her accountable

498
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,880
and that doesn't mean going behind
her back the first chance we get.

499
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,720
Definitely didn't have
Luke puts his faith

500
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,920
in a snakebite dealer
on my bingo card.

501
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,480
I'm putting my faith in Ryan.

502
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,000
You were right. We're the bat team,

503
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,040
and the only way it works
is we have each other's back

504
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,000
even if we don't always agree.

505
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,040
I'm really glad you're calling.

506
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
You were right.

507
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,040
I got into this thinking
I'd found some...

508
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,880
<i>Version of a family.</i>

509
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,520
I never signed up
to watch someone get gunned down.

510
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,280
Then you're ready to make it right.

511
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,800
Who killed the commissioner?

512
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,040
You really friends with Batwoman?

513
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
I'm here.

514
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,880
We need to find a safe house
for Angelique

515
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,640
<i>until the real killers
are behind bars.</i>

516
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,560
I know an underground clinic
that's not being used at the moment.

517
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,960
Perfect. Anything else
anyone wants to add?

518
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,960
Starts with an "s,"
ends with me saying,

519
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,160
<i>"I told you so"?</i>

520
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,840
Even if we don't agree
with the method,

521
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,160
we have to trust you
to make the hard decisions.

522
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
We're a team.

523
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,640
Angelique?

524
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Angelique?

525
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,480
They got to her.

526
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,920
Angelique Martin,

527
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,400
I understand you're interested
in leaving the False Face Society.

528
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,480
A word to the wise.

529
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,880
That's what leaving looks like.

530
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,440
<i>Angelique's phone sent a signal</i>

531
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,440
<i>from the west yard
30 minutes ago, then died.</i>

532
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,000
<i>So she's somewhere
inside a janky, old sawmill?</i>

533
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,880
Gotham bad guys wouldn't
have it any other way.

534
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
Tell me about it.

535
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Found her.

536
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,400
Batwoman, I think they found you.

537
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
<i>- You. You okay?</i>
- Ask them that.

538
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,680
Batwoman, come in. Are you there?

539
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,920
Don't, no. Please, please. Help me.

540
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Oh, my god.

541
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Luke.

542
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,040
They must have taken my comms.

543
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,720
Find the witness, bring her to me.

544
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,440
Very simple task...

545
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,840
And you failed.

546
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,600
Consider this
your termination notice.

547
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,600
No, no, please. Come on.
No, please, please.

548
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,160
Stop it, stop it. Please!

549
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,080
Oh, god! please, please!

550
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

551
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Next!

552
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,320
what the hell are you doing?

553
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,120
It's an H.R. Matter.
What are you Osha?

554
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,640
I'm here for your prisoner.

555
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,360
Let her go. She's not like you.

556
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,880
Oh, please. Enlighten me.

557
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Who am I?

558
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,760
You're a sadistic drug lord.

559
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,720
Okay. I can see
why you might think that,

560
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,760
but it's Gotham
that's sadistic, not me.

561
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,360
And they say
the best way to change the system

562
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
is from within.

563
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,600
You're not changing crap.

564
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,120
And you are?

565
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,840
I'm doing my best every damn day!

566
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,920
your best isn't good enough

567
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,640
and I know that better
than anyone.

568
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,200
My daughter was imprisoned
by the Crows

569
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,920
and killed by Batwoman.

570
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,400
I never killed anyone.

571
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,880
But you've taken on the symbol
of the woman who did.

572
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,440
So tell me, is that change

573
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,080
or is that just pandering
to a sick city

574
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,760
that worships
extremist Crows and bats?

575
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,440
Maybe you wouldn't bother me
so much if I said I was a squirrel.

576
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,840
You've really convinced yourself

577
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,600
this creepy mask is a symbol for,
what, a concerned citizen?

578
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
No.

579
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,560
It's a symbol of liberation
from people like you,

580
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,480
people who think they'll
never be held accountable

581
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,520
as long as they pretend
that what they do is justice.

582
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,240
Look. We all have pain in our past.

583
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,600
You can't use it to do this.

584
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,800
I promise you if you let us go

585
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,120
I will find out
what happened to your daughter.

586
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,360
There will be accountability.

587
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,000
There will indeed.

588
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,480
But not because of anything you did.

589
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,600
Thank you!

590
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,200
Got an SOS from Luke.

591
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,000
He said your comms went off.

592
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
You're safe now.

593
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
I got you.

594
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,440
Damn. Ryan was actually serious.

595
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,960
Angelique's gonna take down
False Face

596
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,760
and we're gonna protect her.

597
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
What is this?

598
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,120
- That would be my confession.
- Come on.

599
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,320
We both know you didn't pull
the trigger on Forbes.

600
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,760
A witness saw you drive
the getaway car.

601
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,800
Why confess to a crime
you didn't commit?

602
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,440
I knew the Crows were dumb.

603
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,480
I didn't know they were deaf too.

604
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,520
If you give me the names
of the shooters right now,

605
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,520
I can help arrange a plea deal.

606
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,720
You could go free.

607
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,440
I killed Forbes

608
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,360
I pulled the trigger

609
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,000
and I acted alone.

610
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,720
Now read me my damn rights
and take me to jail.

611
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,600
Why throw away your life for a gang

612
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,360
that doesn't give a crap about you?

613
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,360
Want to tell me what I'm missing?

614
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,360
Your sister's at the bar.

615
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,920
She can throw them back.

616
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,440
Not who I'm looking for.

617
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,120
Your girl Angelique,

618
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,320
she wanted me to give you something.

619
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
<i>Please just talk to me</i>

620
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,520
<i>Oh, I know these...</i>

621
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,640
Why do you have this?

622
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,000
where's Angelique?

623
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,600
She's on her way to jail.

624
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,040
- I'm sorry.
- What did you do?

625
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,400
she confessed.

626
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,960
- She's taking the fall.
- It was your job to stop her.

627
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,760
Trust me I tried.

628
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,880
She knew she would
have been protected.

629
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,360
Why would she destroy
the rest of her life

630
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,960
to cover for a bunch
of False Face thugs?

631
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,360
Because apparently

632
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,320
Black Mask threatened
to kill a certain bartender

633
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,320
that Angelique had been texting
with to get back together.

634
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,840
Angelique was willing
to risk her own life,

635
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,480
but there was one thing
she wasn't willing to risk...

636
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
You.

637
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,120
I'm sorry.

638
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,000
You know she didn't do it.

639
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,840
You can't let her get away with it.

640
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,600
That's how the law works.

641
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,560
And that's exactly why
all these systems are broken.

642
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You're right.

643
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,480
So what are you gonna do about it?

644
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
I don't know,

645
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,560
but I know that
can't be the way it is.

646
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,280
Hey. When did you become so wise?

647
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,640
When you stopped seeing me
as your little sister.

648
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,520
Well, I hate to break it to you,

649
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
but you'll always be my little sis.

650
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,200
Hi. I'm agent Julia Pennyworth.

651
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,080
I'm investigating the crash
of flight GC9K23.

652
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,440
<i>Yeah. Agent Pennyworth.
We spoke about this last month.</i>

653
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
I'm sorry?

654
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,120
<i>You called last month inquiring
about the third loader.</i>

655
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,160
<i>I explained it was a reporting error.</i>

656
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,080
<i>We only employ two loaders
at national city's private airport.</i>

657
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,120
I think you've mistaken me
for somebody else.

658
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,160
I just started
my investigation today.

659
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,800
<i>Julia, right? It's Kurt.</i>

660
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,080
<i>We talked about your accent.</i>

661
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,720
<i>We both used to summer camp
in Oxfordshire.</i>

662
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,640
Why don't I remember
speaking with you?

663
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,320
When we learned Kate was gone

664
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,960
I asked myself what my legacy
would be as Batwoman

665
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,720
but that wasn't the right question.

666
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,400
The question isn't
who am I in the suit.

667
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,400
It's who am I out of it.

668
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,480
Two days ago, I didn't know.

669
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,280
Bruce Wayne had
the bat code for himself.

670
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,200
I'm declaring the three rules
of the bat team.

671
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,840
Rule number three.

672
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,720
We've got each other's backs...

673
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Always.

674
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,400
- Works for me.
- Me, too.

675
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,160
So if we've got each other's back,

676
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,400
that means rule number two.

677
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,120
We hold each other accountable.

678
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,760
Like you did for me today.

679
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,360
Most importantly, we stand
for something bigger than ourselves.

680
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,240
It's a little easier said than done.
What are you thinking?

681
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,720
Batwoman takes some
of the awful off the streets

682
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,200
but the bat team needs to
replace it with something positive.

683
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,600
That's how change happens.

684
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,680
Getting adopted by Mama Cora,
that was my game changer

685
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,080
but Angelique didn't have that.

686
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,640
We are going to take down
Black Mask and his False Face gang.

687
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,960
But what are we gonna bring to Gotham
that no other guy comes along

688
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,520
and gets his hooks in other kids?

689
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,840
Jordan Moore is working
on building a community center.

690
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,360
I want us to bring it to life.

691
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,240
What do you say?
you guys want to help me?

692
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,240
So the key to making
my pain disappear

693
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,920
is to dig up my dead cat?

694
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,240
I am not opening
a dead kitty's coffin.

695
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,000
Then why'd you dig the hole?

696
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,960
Okay. My interest is piqued.

697
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,760
What is happening?

698
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,520
This is what you do, Alice.

699
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,000
What you did that day in your cell

700
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,160
when you learned to sew faces
using human flesh?

701
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,400
Then you did it again when you found
your mother's head in a freezer.

702
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,680
I'm having a psychotic break.

703
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,400
When your reality is too much
for you to process,

704
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,320
you imagine things askew,

705
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,000
so they're easier to digest.

706
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,360
You pretend you're
in wonderland drinking tea,

707
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,480
or you black out
your own moral code

708
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,800
to scorch a woman to death

709
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,280
Or you see your dead sister.

710
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,280
I'm not handling Kate's
death very well, am I?

711
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
you're in shock

712
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,480
and you know
that once it wears off

713
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,560
you'll be struck
by a tsunami of grief.

714
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
How does one deal
with grief exactly?

715
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,880
That's the problem.

716
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,760
You've never done
that before

717
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,200
and you're scared
of what it will make you do.

718
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,200
Or undo.

719
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,480
Spare yourself the pain.

720
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,560
Your mind is limitless, Alice.

721
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,680
If it can make you believe you're
petting your dead cat right now,

722
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,840
it can make you believe anything.

723
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,200
It can make me believe
in a world where Kate never existed.

724
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,160
I can forget you, Kate.

725
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,960
Poor thing.

726
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,920
What happened to her face?

727
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,360
She fought my men while
they were pulling her from the plane.

728
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,040
Didn't go so well for her.

729
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,000
I suppose it's for the best.

730
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,880
Facial recognition
leads to memory recall.

731
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,720
Leave us.

732
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,800
Hello.

733
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,600
My name is Enigma.

734
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,000
You won't be needing this anymore.

735
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,400
It's time to say goodbye...

736
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,520
to Kate Kane.
