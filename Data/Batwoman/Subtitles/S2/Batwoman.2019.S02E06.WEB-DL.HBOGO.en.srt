1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,800
Patient A is a 10-year-old male
with stage-IV leukemia.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,440
On January 31st,
he was bitten by a bat

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,320
during the attacks in Gotham Square.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,880
And he immediately began
showing signs of sepsis.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,360
Later that night,
he received a dose

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,880
of the miracle serum, BP296...
to relieve the sepsis immediately.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,080
He's here today, however,
because we discovered 72 hours later,

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,440
that it also cured his stage-IV
Leukemia. Completely.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,880
So today, we've isolated
his white blood cells

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,960
in an attempt to siphon and replicate
their curative properties.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,880
We are now mixing them
in our synthetic granulocytes.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,200
And we are now injecting them
into Patient B

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,840
an 80-year-old male
with a similar cancer.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,960
Our hypothesis
is that the new solution

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,280
will attack his cancer
in the same way.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,800
We'll check back in 24 hours
and look for progress.

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,080
We need help in here!

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,320
Just try to sit back.
Just try to relax.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Help! Help!

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,120
The toxin spread by the bats

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,120
was intentionally designed
by Hamilton without a cure.

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,440
That serum cured it.

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,560
And not just that,
it reversed hereditary conditions.

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,880
Eradicated anemia, malaria,
all types of blood diseases.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,200
- We can't replicate it, sir...
- Try again.

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,880
Sir, with all due respect,
how many people have to die

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,000
for me to make my point?

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,760
How many people get to live
if I make mine?

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,000
Whatever was in the antidote
for that bat toxin

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,680
is gonna change
modern medicine forever.

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,200
The supply was exhausted
before we knew its potential

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,960
and it can't be synthesized.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,080
It's gone, sir.

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,320
Well, it came from somewhere, right?

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,400
Do you really think someone's
gonna just hand over

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,520
the secret to a miracle cure?

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,200
No. I expect they're
gonna cherish it

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,240
like it's the most valuable thing
in the world.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,600
- Don't let this door close.
- What's this one's deal?

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,080
- Mr. Hellzinger...
- What? What's happening?

41
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,760
Aaron. It's me. It's Dr. Rogers.

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,800
Tell... tell me you got a...

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,880
Tell me you got a fix, Doc.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,120
Not at the moment, I'm afraid.

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,280
I didn't do anything. Help me!

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,720
Aaron, you're okay.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,520
You just,
you just had an episode.

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,480
- I can't keep living like this.
- That's why I'm here.

49
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,280
There is a cure for you...

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,080
and for dozens of other patients
that are cooped up in here.

51
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,440
And Aaron,
you're gonna help me get it.

52
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,080
<i>The role of Batwoman will now
be played by...</i>

53
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,040
<i>Well, we don't actually
know her name.</i>

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,680
<i>But 2.0 seems to be
sticking around for a while.</i>

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,320
<i>You got some big boots to fill,
new girl.</i>

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
<i>Hope you like all-nighters.</i>

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Hi.

58
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,040
Nobody robs banks anymore?

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,680
You got to loot mom
and pop shops?

60
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,120
<i>- Are you good?</i>
- Little busy.

61
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,560
Your heart rate is flooring it
right now.

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,040
- If you need back up...
- I need you to let me

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,320
do my job right now!

64
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,240
You believe it or not, the pacing?

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,640
{\an5}It isn't healing me.

66
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,840
{\an5}What the hell is taking them
so long?

67
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,080
Hey, you!

68
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,560
We have been waiting for a doctor
for two hours.

69
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh, actually I'm not her attending...

70
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,040
{\an5}Oh, actually, have you ever heard
of a little issue

71
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,320
{\an5}in your medical community
called implicit bias?

72
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,440
{\an5}Sorry, we're coding down
the hall...

73
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,520
{\an5}- Let me educate you on something...
- Ang, please, he's busy...

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,080
{\an5}It's the reason black women
die of neglect

75
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,440
{\an5}at a disproportionately high rate
in this country.

76
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,720
{\an5}We're not having that tonight.

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,440
You need to get my girl
some actual care

78
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,960
before you need your own.

79
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,960
I'll find your attending.

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,920
Okay.

81
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,040
{\an5}That was extra.

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,160
Also, thank you for bringing me here.

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,840
{\an5}I don't know who else
you'd call at 2.00am.

84
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,120
And if you did...

85
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,880
I would have been a little jeal.

86
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
- Yeah.
- Only you, babe.

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,120
{\an5}Miss Wilder. I'm Dr. Rodriguez.

88
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,840
{\an5}I understand you have an infection?

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah.

90
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,400
I've had it a couple of months.

91
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,000
{\an5}This is really extensive.

92
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,360
- How'd you get this?
- A spider...

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,360
At my work's stockroom.

94
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,640
{\an5}We'll get you some antibiotics.

95
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,680
{\an5}Should start to clear up
in about 48 hours.

96
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,840
That's it?

97
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,760
{\an5}When she showed up at my doorstep
she could barely stand.

98
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,280
Run some tests or something.

99
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,400
Unfortunately, her insurance
doesn't cover any bloodwork.

100
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,640
I'll cover it, then.

101
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,760
Someone will be by to draw blood.

102
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,320
{\an5}You're blowing up.

103
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,960
{\an5}- Now, you have a shortage of words?
- You know what I do, Ryan.

104
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,600
{\an5}I don't need you
judging me for it.

105
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,200
I'm not judging you.

106
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,120
I want you to get out while you can.

107
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,720
- Get out?
- Yeah.

108
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,120
{\an5}Ryan, I trap for the rich and famous.

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,800
{\an5}The things I know about them,
about my plug...

110
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,320
{\an5}I can't just "get out".

111
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,360
You can if you let me help you.

112
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
Look, I got to go, okay?

113
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,240
{\an5}We'll pick this up later.

114
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,040
To be clear, you think I pulled out
a tube of my lipstick

115
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,560
wrote this note

116
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,880
{\an5}hunted you down,
and then tossed it at your feet

117
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,800
{\an5}because I don't have
anything better to do?

118
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,200
{\an5}Safiyah seems to thinks so.

119
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,840
{\an5}I told you, I don't have anything
to do with Kate Kane

120
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
and I didn't send this note.

121
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,760
And I think if you really believed

122
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,760
I tried to blow up
your sister's airplane...

123
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,600
{\an5}this conversation would look
a lot more

124
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,200
{\an5}like you fumbling to kill me again.

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
{\an5}I wasn't "fumbling".
I was due-diligencing.

126
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,320
{\an5}It will be very clear
when I transition to actual murder.

127
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,680
I'm sure. Look, I'm a botanist.

128
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,600
{\an5}I work alone. I keep to myself.

129
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
{\an5}The idea of picking a fight
with a warlord

130
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,640
sounds like a lot of work.

131
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,520
{\an5}Trust me, it's a full-time job.

132
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,240
{\an5}So, why does she think that you tried
to frame her for my sister's death?

133
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,480
Why don't you ask her yourself?

134
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,360
The last thing I need

135
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,160
is to be in the middle
of two crazy bitches

136
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,760
trying to rip each other's hair out.

137
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,440
Have a nice life.

138
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,040
Doesn't it bother you

139
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,400
that we both magically forgot
being on Coryana together?

140
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,640
That there were obviously pieces
of both our memories wiped?

141
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,000
I grow psychedelic mushrooms
for a living.

142
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,720
You think it's the first memory
I've lost?

143
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,040
Did you forget that she has
an army?

144
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,240
Those guys she sent are just
the beginning and you know it.

145
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,680
Even if you run to the ends
of the Earth,

146
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,880
she has plenty of assassins
with pointy weapons

147
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,440
and a lot of frequent flyer miles.

148
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,000
So, why does she think
you framed her?

149
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I trained her army.

150
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,280
I followed her rules.
I was a good little soldier.

151
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,360
And then, I got bored.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,240
You tried to leave.

153
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,600
Not just leave.

154
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,280
I tried to leave with one of her
precious flowers.

155
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,440
I thought I could grow it here,

156
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
do some good,
make a decent living.

157
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,320
I got busted and she exiled me.

158
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,400
So, you got to leave, just without
your little green parting gift?

159
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,200
Woke up in Gotham Harbor
with the worst hangover of my life.

160
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,240
Meaning, you don't remember the how,
the where and the with whoms.

161
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,240
Are ready to hear what I think?

162
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,840
I've had an option this whole time?

163
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,200
I think that you didn't get caught

164
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,600
trying to leave the island
with the Desert Rose.

165
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,640
Based on my little hot flashes
I think we got caught...

166
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,520
together.

167
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,520
And I think she let us keep
all our memories...

168
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,920
except the ones, specifically...

169
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
of each other.

170
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,960
Can you believe the audacity
of that lawyer?

171
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,160
He knows everything
that you went through with Beth.

172
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,040
And now he's trying to browbeat you
into declaring another daughter dead.

173
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,360
So that he can what,
claim his three percent

174
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,520
of Kate's multi-million dollar
estate?

175
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,960
It's disgusting.
He should have his license revoked.

176
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,840
You know, if this med school thing
doesn't work out

177
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,240
there's always litigation.

178
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,920
Thanks for bringing me.

179
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,320
- Moore, what'd you find?
- The Napier's a fake.

180
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,760
What? How is that possible?

181
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,000
It's pig's blood.

182
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
According to our forensics tech,

183
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,800
the real Jack Napier
would've favored a more...

184
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,800
biologically human pigmentation.

185
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,960
So it's a dead-end.

186
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,600
Not exactly.
We found a partial print.

187
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,400
ID'd the forger
to a 30-something male in Gotham.

188
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,560
Well, that means there's
a good chance

189
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,920
he knows a hell of a lot
about the original.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,280
- What's his name?
- Ocean.

191
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,120
The guy Alice was looking for,
and now we know why.

192
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,280
I might be able to track him down
but I need permission

193
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,280
to use the high-frequency
generator receiver.

194
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,600
- Granted. Get it done.
- Copy that, sir.

195
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,960
Okay, I give up.

196
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,320
What's a high-frequency generator
recei...

197
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,080
Not open yet.

198
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,640
Door was.

199
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,120
Good to see you staying
out of trouble.

200
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,680
Good to have your approval
that I don't care about.

201
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,880
Still not open.

202
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,520
I've been building a case
on your girl Angelique Martin.

203
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,800
Looks like Snakebite's
her new money-maker.

204
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,560
Her name's linked
to five outstanding possession cases.

205
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,160
Party kids. No loyalty.

206
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,440
- What do you want, Crow-phie?
- She's the little fish.

207
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,960
I'm looking for her supplier.

208
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,400
A grower linked
to the psychedelic mushrooms

209
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,240
being used in Snakebite.

210
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,440
Goes by Ocean.

211
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,560
- Never heard of him.
- Angelique has.

212
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,200
I saw her at his apartment
before he split.

213
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,320
I just need your help getting
his new location from her.

214
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,200
Sure, I'll just casually
text her and ask.

215
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,960
You don't have to ask her anything.

216
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,240
Once this is within range
of her cell...

217
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,040
it'll install
an invisible high-frequency

218
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,720
generator-receiver app.

219
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,120
Essentially turns her cell
into a digital and audio microphone.

220
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,360
I just need you to get it
close enough to transfer.

221
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,240
You can't be serious right now?

222
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,880
As serious as your girl
doing eight-to-10 at Blackgate.

223
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,320
Okay. First of all...

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,440
technology like this should not
exist in a free society.

225
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,720
Second, screw you.
I'm not betraying my girlfriend.

226
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,400
This is the same Angelique
who let you

227
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,120
take the fall for her, right?

228
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,520
Who continues to sell

229
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,960
even after you served time
for being caught

230
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,640
with her drugs on you?

231
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,160
Do the right thing here, Ryan.

232
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,400
I'll get you the information
you want.

233
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,520
And then this file right here?
It disappears.

234
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,400
Is that clear?

235
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,000
I do this, you can't touch her.

236
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,040
You can't protect her forever.

237
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,160
No. But I can protect her
from you.

238
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,760
Is that clear?

239
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
Crystal.

240
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,440
- Mary?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

241
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,120
He didn't hurt me.

242
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,120
What is this place?

243
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,600
I don't know.

244
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,280
Looks like some sort
of underground clinic.

245
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,720
Not that I've ever seen one.

246
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Finally.
Okay, hi. First hostage.

247
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,000
Unfortunately, no.

248
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,160
No, I mean me.
I've never done this before.

249
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,880
But if all goes right...

250
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,440
Okay...

251
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,520
I forgot what I was gonna say!

252
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,480
Sorry! Spontaneous rage issues!

253
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,640
My brain's a little wonky.

254
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,360
What do you want?

255
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,480
The antidote. The antidote
Hamilton used on the bat toxin.

256
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,920
We don't have anything to do
with Hamilton Dynamics anymore.

257
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,600
I don't know anything
about the antidote.

258
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,880
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to her.

259
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,400
They said it's somewhere
in this underground lab.

260
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,560
So, where is it?

261
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
She doesn't know anything
about it either...

262
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,160
Actually, I know literally
everything about it.

263
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,440
There's none left.

264
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,560
No!

265
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,960
I can't kill her. I need her.

266
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,040
Where... where did you get it?

267
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,800
Long story short.

268
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,600
On the night that total bitch
named Alice

269
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,720
poisoned my mom and me...

270
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,560
She gave me the cure a.k.a
the serum

271
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,320
from this fabled island flower.

272
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,880
It's called the Desert Rose.

273
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,440
Okay, but a few months later,
I had this blood...

274
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Let's just call it a transfusion

275
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,000
and it was no longer
in my system anymore.

276
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,520
But unbeknownst to me,

277
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,840
Alice stole a pint
of the transfusion blood.

278
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,360
And on the night of the bat attack,

279
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,680
she gave it back to me.

280
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,480
She gave it back to me
and said it would save everyone

281
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,240
because it still contained
the Desert Rose.

282
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,600
I gave to Hamilton and I told him
to make an antidote.

283
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,880
To my shock, it actually worked.

284
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,600
Why you didn't tell me about this?

285
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
Would you have believed me?

286
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,400
I believe you and I need you
to make more.

287
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,760
Don't you think that I tried?

288
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,640
The solution only retains stability
after one generation.

289
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Hamilton doctors could extract it
from my blood

290
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,480
to treat patients with it.

291
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,440
But once it's been extracted
from the second bloodstream

292
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,760
it loses its curative properties.

293
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,720
Trust me. I would love nothing more

294
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,640
than to be the one who finds
the cure for blood disease.

295
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,560
You're not learning all this
at Gotham U, are you?

296
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,560
No, Dad. I'm not.

297
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,600
Oh, God. This isn't the way
that I wanted to tell you.

298
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,760
But I've been practicing
underground medicine for two years.

299
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,920
What do you mean
underground medicine?

300
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,840
I mean, the reason why he's here
looking for the antidote...

301
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,320
is because the antidote came
from here.

302
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,040
This is my clinic.

303
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Damn it.

304
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, I know your client
is a major star

305
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,840
and way too busy
to walk to an ATM.

306
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,600
But that still doesn't change
the fact

307
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,080
that I don't use cash apps.

308
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,280
This isn't her
save the pigs charity. Bye.

309
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
What?

310
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,160
You kept the plant I gave you.

311
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,000
What, like, five years ago?

312
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,200
You're soft, babe.

313
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,760
How are you feeling?

314
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Hopeful.

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,360
Because...

316
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,280
- I don't get it.
- It's your uniform.

317
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,440
For your new job at the Hold-Up.

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,440
It's legit and I can protect you.

319
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,320
- Well, you will protect me.
- Yeah.

320
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,840
- Okay.
- Because you said you wanted out.

321
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,520
This is me giving you a way out.

322
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,560
That's very, very sweet, Ry.

323
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,120
Good, because you start tomorrow
and gays order some weird-ass drinks

324
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,880
- that you have to learn how to...
- I don't want out.

325
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,680
- Wait, but you said that...
- I lied.

326
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,520
I like my job. I'm good at it.

327
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,080
People actually respect me.

328
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,800
What people?
You sling to influencers.

329
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,120
Sorry, I'm not living up
to your moral standards.

330
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,120
But some of us didn't get
Brangelina'd

331
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,160
- from the group home.
- What is that supposed to mean?

332
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,320
Somebody found you, Ry.
And you got a new life.

333
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,440
I didn't.

334
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,520
I didn't know what it felt like
to be found by something.

335
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
Now, I do.

336
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,800
- I went to prison for you.
- And I have apologized for that.

337
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,720
It doesn't count
if you don't change... Oh, my...

338
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,080
- I can't. The room is spinning.
- Ry.

339
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,760
- What... what... what can I do?
- My medicine is in the bathroom.

340
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,920
What is happening to me?

341
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,840
I think they're underneath
the sink.

342
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
- I don't see them.
- Are you sure?

343
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,480
They should be under there.

344
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,440
They were
in the medicine cabinet.

345
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,360
I need to go check
in on some people.

346
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,440
Take these, please.

347
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,600
And I'm not saying
that as some "shady dealer".

348
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,960
Consider this mis-filed.

349
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,720
I know this was hard for you.

350
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,040
But you don't, though.

351
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,600
Because you don't know
what we've been through.

352
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,320
I know you're right back
in the exact same situation

353
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,480
you already served time for
and you're choosing to stay there.

354
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Why?

355
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
You've never been in love, huh?

356
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,520
- Of course I've been in love.
- And now you're alone.

357
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,440
See, when I care about someone,
I fight for them.

358
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,920
- Ryan speaking.
<i>- Ms. Wilder, this is Dr. Rodriguez</i>

359
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,160
<i>from Gotham City General.</i>

360
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,760
I'd like you to come
in for retesting.

361
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,320
What's wrong with the first test?

362
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,840
<i>Unfortunately, I think there was
a contamination with the sample.</i>

363
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,840
Contamination? What?

364
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,960
Lab contaminants.

365
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,680
We're picking up a presence
of radioactive material.

366
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,040
<i>So, unless you were
taking selfies at Chernobyl</i>

367
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,000
<i>you wouldn't have read-outs
like these.</i>

368
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
<i>The front desk will give you
a call to set up an appointment.</i>

369
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
<i>Have a good day.</i>

370
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Okay.

371
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,040
You gonna need to learn
to make more of that serum

372
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,520
right now, or he dies.

373
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,640
We told you. There is no antidote.

374
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,320
There is none.

375
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,760
- Who are you working for?
- No... no... no. No names.

376
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,960
That's the rules...

377
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,480
Pain meds?

378
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,720
Far cabinet. Far cabinet.
Over there, far cabinet.

379
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,160
- Did he hit your celiac artery?
- I'm fine.

380
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm more concerned
with how I could be blind

381
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,200
to yet another daughter's
secret life.

382
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,880
It's not your fault.
When you met my mom,

383
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,440
all of your energy was focused
on finding Beth.

384
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
And then when you couldn't
find her...

385
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,720
it was about building The Crows.

386
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
And now...

387
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,400
It's all about finding Kate.
And the truth in there is...

388
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,000
I've never really been
on your radar.

389
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,160
- Mary.
- It's okay.

390
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,040
- I can tell him about Coryana.
- No, absolutely not.

391
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,600
- He's gonna kill you.
- He kills me, he's got nothing.

392
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,240
I have had years
of resistance training.

393
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,400
I'll be fine.

394
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,480
That craniotomy scar...

395
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,880
Is that what you're trying
to heal?

396
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,960
Shrinks called me amygdala.

397
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Said I had my circuits mixed up,
that I reacted wrong to things.

398
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,640
Saw a puppy, I got pissed off.

399
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,800
Saw a kid crying,
it cracked me up.

400
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,920
Then five years ago...

401
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,480
the doctors decided
I'd be the perfect lab rat

402
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,680
for this secret experimental
treatment,

403
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,560
so they fried the bad parts
of my brain with UV light.

404
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,520
Some two dozen treatments later,
I go to a movie.

405
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,800
I'm sitting there, at one point...

406
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,800
I start laughing.

407
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,040
And then I hear
everybody else around me...

408
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,120
and they were laughing too.

409
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,520
That'd never happened before.

410
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,320
For the first time in my life
I felt normal.

411
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,480
The UV-exposure, it worked?

412
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,240
It did. For a week.

413
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,360
And then cancer bloomed
in my brain...

414
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,480
like a cherry blossom.

415
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,640
And sometimes...

416
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,520
the tumor rubs up
against my amygdala...

417
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,520
And...

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,120
- I have an unfortunate moment!
- Stop!

419
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,920
Please. Please, stop. Stop.
You don't want to do this.

420
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,520
You're gonna kill him.

421
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,120
Don't you get it?

422
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,440
My amygdala's infested with cancer.

423
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,120
His pain doesn't compute with me.

424
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,640
I don't feel anything...

425
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,560
But angry.

426
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,560
- Okay. There's more antidote.
- Where?

427
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,080
- Mary, no.
- There's an island

428
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,240
and if you can get there,

429
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,920
you can have all the cure
that you want.

430
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,280
Just, just let my dad go.

431
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
How do I get there?

432
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,640
She doesn't want anyone knowing
the location of the island.

433
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,560
So she blitzed my memory
so I could never get back.

434
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,120
She didn't just erase that day.

435
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,160
She erased our entire existence
from each other.

436
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,320
- That's not strange to you?
- You're right, Alice.

437
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,080
Maybe, you were the one busted
stealing the Desert Rose

438
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,520
and maybe you framed me
to save your own ass.

439
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,440
I don't think I would've
done that.

440
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,880
Why? Too honorable?

441
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,720
You helped me gut three men
yesterday.

442
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,000
You really don't remember, do you?

443
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,520
Remember what?

444
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,840
You and I had a thing together.

445
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,800
From the looks of it,
it should've been memorable.

446
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,880
Oh, crap.

447
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,960
Yeah. My thoughts exactly.

448
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,280
Kryptonite is comprised
of sodium, lithium, boron

449
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,800
and elements not found on earth.

450
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,760
As a result, this makes it
the singular material

451
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,400
that can penetrate the batsuit,

452
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,400
and the only failsafe
that protects the suit

453
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,720
against corruption.

454
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,520
Hey, there you are.

455
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,480
- You haven't checked in all day.
- Sorry.

456
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,200
I was busy betraying my girlfriend

457
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,760
so your Crow, Sophie,
can make a drug bust.

458
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Oh, you mean Ocean?

459
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,840
- How do you know about that?
- Sophie told me

460
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,520
that he forged
the fake Jack Napier painting

461
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,840
and might know where
the real one is.

462
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,040
So her story about having
a case on Angelique

463
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,160
to catch her dealer.

464
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,040
It was all BS?

465
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,360
No, it's not all BS.
We need Ocean to find Kate.

466
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,920
What does he have to do
with Kate?

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,640
According to Alice,
he has ties to Coryana.

468
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,880
So we ran a search,
but the guy's practically a ghost.

469
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,160
I'm gonna need you to go back
to the part

470
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
where you said,
"according to Alice".

471
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,680
- When were you talking to Alice?
- Yeah. Right, so...

472
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,960
at Sophie's condo the other day,
she was there.

473
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,680
And when I showed up,
she put a gun on me.

474
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,920
And then you left
and promptly called 911.

475
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,360
And then you left,
and promptly called 911

476
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,720
to tell the cops the location
of the bitch

477
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,600
- whose gang killed my mom.
- Right now,

478
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
Alice is our only way to Coryana.

479
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,160
It's Mary, I...

480
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,360
- Hey, not a great time.
- Lucas, hey.

481
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,880
I'm gonna need you to bring me
that map to Coryana.

482
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,360
What? What are you talking about?

483
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,160
My dad and I are here at my clinic
and he asked to see it.

484
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,800
What the hell is your dad doing
at the clinic?

485
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,800
I'll tell you as soon as you
bring me the map.

486
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,040
Okay? Fast as you can.

487
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,080
You know, like a bat out of hell.

488
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,440
<i>- Mary, everything good?</i>
- I'm fine, Lucas.

489
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,760
Just bring me the map,
I'm not messing around.

490
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,720
Her dad can't know about the clinic.

491
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,080
She's never called me Lucas.
Ever. Not once.

492
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,880
"A bat out of hell"?

493
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,640
Something's wrong.
I need to get to her.

494
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,720
- What's up with you?
- No, no, no. I just...

495
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,560
- just need some space.
- Okay. Well, what can I do...

496
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,800
I don't need your...

497
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,760
Ryan? Ryan? Hey!

498
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,080
Ryan? What's going on?

499
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,560
It doesn't make sense.

500
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,520
You're a painter.
Do I have to draw you a picture?

501
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,240
When two people don't hate
each other very much...

502
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,480
I mean, Coryana was remote,
but I was never desperate.

503
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,400
Well, apparently I was.

504
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,040
- Where are you going?
- To call Safiyah's side-chick.

505
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,000
Can I assume it's done?

506
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,920
I was calling your henchman.

507
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,160
Do you normally answer the phone
for your underlings?

508
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,600
It's normally not you.

509
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,760
How are you, Alice?

510
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,480
I've never asked this to a woman,
but...

511
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,600
You didn't happen to roofie me
for six months straight, did you?

512
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,240
Because I'm hitting
a lot of potholes

513
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
on memory lane that need filling.

514
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,360
What did you do to me?

515
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,080
I made you a woman who could
put a knife

516
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,320
through a man's heart.

517
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,720
- Tell me everything you erased.
<i>- Happy to.</i>

518
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,760
But first, ask yourself,
is that really what I want?

519
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,920
Wouldn't it be so much easier
not having

520
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,040
<i>an emotional attachment to the man</i>

521
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,520
<i>you've been tasked to kill?</i>

522
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,880
Why don't you ask someone
who has emotional attachments?

523
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,680
Says the girl willing to do
anything to get her sister back.

524
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,520
I wondered why you tasked me

525
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,640
with such a specific
piece of work, and...

526
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,400
Now, I know.

527
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,840
So you could sit back
and watch me kill an old flame.

528
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,560
- You're sick.
- No, Alice.

529
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,200
Sick would be telling you
all the details

530
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,160
of your story with Ocean
and then asking you to kill him.

531
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,280
Which, again, I am happy to do,
if you so desire.

532
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,280
<i>Let me know what you decide.</i>

533
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,680
Did that just pulsate?

534
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,920
This is why no one can help me.

535
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,280
This is from the kryptonite?
You said you were fine.

536
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,520
I thought I was.

537
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,120
I knew it could pierce the batsuit.

538
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,160
But when you survived Tommy
shooting you

539
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,520
I assumed it meant it was only fatal

540
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,040
if the shot hit a vital organ.

541
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,320
No. Kryptonite kills.

542
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,440
Just hella slow.

543
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,480
Why didn't you say anything?

544
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,840
What was I about to say
after I begged to put on the suit?

545
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,000
"Hey, can I take a sick day?"

546
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,400
I spent every second in that thing

547
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,520
trying to convince you
I'm at least half as good as Kate.

548
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,320
Wasn't about to give you
one more reason to doubt me.

549
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,320
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,080
Hey, we don't have time for this.

551
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,120
- I need to get to Mary.
- You can barely walk.

552
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,480
You can keep telling me
everything I can't do...

553
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,720
or you can make yourself useful
and have my back for once.

554
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,440
You're an idiot.

555
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,960
Now, use my weight against me.

556
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,080
I think Safiyah will like you.

557
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,400
<i>I wanna escape...</i>

558
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
<i>and I want you to come with me.</i>

559
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,280
- What did you see?
- What did you see?

560
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,760
That this is

561
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,320
getting complicated.

562
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,760
Hands where I can see them.

563
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,880
Oh, we're kind of in the middle
of a thing.

564
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,080
I'm not here for you.

565
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,000
Ocean. I'm Agent Moore
with The Crows.

566
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,840
- Where's the Napier painting?
- What Napier painting?

567
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,280
The one you were looking
at when you forged the fake.

568
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,760
No, idea
what you're talking about.

569
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,640
It'll take two minutes
to have this place

570
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,240
swarming with a bunch of Crows

571
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,960
looking to catch the man
responsible

572
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,840
for Gotham's latest
drug epidemic.

573
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,080
Give me the map,
and I'll let you go.

574
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,800
Map? Oh, now I'm intrigued.

575
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,920
- Hand it over.
- Don't.

576
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,080
The faster she gets to the island,

577
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,640
the faster I need you dead.

578
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,280
Not my problem.

579
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,840
Show me the map!

580
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,880
I got the map.

581
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,720
Any chance you know how to read
a nautical chart?

582
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,880
No, but you need to bring it
to the clinic.

583
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,040
I think someone's got Mary.

584
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,800
She said her dad is with her
and that she needs the map.

585
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,640
Oh, my God. Okay, I'm on my way.

586
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,360
She said it's deadly serious,
and this goes without saying,

587
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,760
but you can't actually
hand it over.

588
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,880
I won't.

589
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,880
But I'm also not gonna gamble
with their lives.

590
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,400
- What are you doing?
- That island is growing

591
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,000
the only thing on this planet
that has a shot of curing me.

592
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,480
I'm not putting my life
in the hands of some Crow.

593
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,720
Ryan...

594
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,400
The suit can discharge
a single dose of adrenaline.

595
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,680
When you need a boost,
say the word.

596
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,960
- I got this.
- I know.

597
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,200
You're one of them, aren't you?

598
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,040
I'm so stupid.

599
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,280
- Stupid, stupid, stupid!
- Stop! No.

600
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Stop! Stop! Just stop! One of who?

601
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,000
Just another lying Hamilton.

602
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,520
What? What are you talking about?
Hamilton doctors did this to you?

603
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,880
That's not possible.

604
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,320
You said this happened
five years ago.

605
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,720
Yeah, my mom was CEO then.

606
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,400
She would've never signed off
on secret human testing.

607
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,560
Why do you think
they call it secret, genius?

608
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,080
My new doctors, they promised...

609
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,520
They promised, they promised
to fix me.

610
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,760
Did you know
that this was happening?

611
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,640
Apparently, there's a lot
I don't know about.

612
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,760
Oh, my God!

613
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,760
Drop it or I shoot!

614
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Stop! She brought the map!

615
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,720
- Do not kill her!
- Your family did this to me!

616
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,200
Get her out of here.
Go out the back.

617
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,400
I'm not leaving my agent
in a damn hallway!

618
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,120
I'll protect her. I promise you.
Now, go.

619
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,840
Luke, now.

620
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,320
Batwoman to Batcave. I got it.

621
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,640
It's okay, he's...

622
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,560
Sedate him in the car.

623
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,480
- We don't need any incidents.
- Who are you?

624
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,400
- Just a man looking for a map.
- Don't give it to him.

625
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,480
I will shoot this Crow
in the head.

626
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,960
Her blood will be on your hands,
Batwoman.

627
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,960
Is that really how you want
to start your legacy?

628
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,200
We need that map.

629
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
I know.

630
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,920
But I also can't let you die.

631
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,560
What do you mean, she's dying?

632
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,040
I looked at the wound.
The meds were working.

633
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,640
- Why didn't you tell me?
- She asked me not to.

634
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,440
- But we're the Bat Team.
- Not to her.

635
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,320
The meds aren't working.

636
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,240
Her prolonged exposure to
the kryptonite radiation is lethal.

637
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,240
Ryan's only hope is
the Desert Rose

638
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,400
which is on Coryana with Kate,
who we're never gonna see again.

639
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,120
Since putting on the suit,
Ryan's...

640
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,560
Ryan's made the streets safer.

641
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,560
She's inspired the city

642
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,800
and she helped us find Kate.

643
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,920
And she's done it all
while having a terminal illness.

644
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
I mean, if that's not a hero,
what the hell is?

645
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,800
So we're gonna find Coryana.

646
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,400
We're gonna get Kate back
and we're gonna save Ryan's life.

647
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,280
Except, we have no way
of doing any of those things.

648
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,520
That's not true.

649
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,920
We have my dad.

650
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,720
If these people have anything
to do with Hamilton,

651
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,320
I want to be the first to know
about it.

652
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,520
I want that map in my hands.

653
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,880
I shouldn't have said anything
about Coryana.

654
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,960
You were acting on instinct.
That man was totally unhinged.

655
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,800
Do you think mom knew
what they were doing to that guy?

656
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,720
I think your mom was
a lot like you.

657
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,040
A woman who would do anything
to help people.

658
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,800
I know you're pissed about
the clinic.

659
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,120
I'm shutting it down, Mary.

660
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,320
- Why? Why would you do that?
- It's illegal.

661
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,920
Yeah, but a lot of people
in Gotham

662
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,520
can't afford healthcare
in the legal way.

663
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,200
Practicing without a license,
impersonating a doctor,

664
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,040
possession of narcotics.
Need I go on?

665
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,760
But I've saved hundreds,
maybe thousands of lives.

666
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,400
And even more than that,
I make people feel

667
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,600
like they're worthy
of being alive.

668
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,520
Gotham City General
can't say that.

669
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,800
I'm not questioning your passion
or the good that you've done,

670
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,400
but did you not listen
to what the man said?

671
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,360
This is exactly
how your mother started.

672
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,600
With good intentions and a lot
of disappearing lines in the sand.

673
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,440
Mom knew about the clinic.

674
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
She was proud of me.

675
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,160
She was conducting
human experiments, Mary.

676
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,120
Well, I wouldn't do that.

677
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,520
Every sick person who walks

678
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,440
through your front door
is an experiment

679
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,040
because you are not qualified.

680
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,640
So, is this what being a dad
means to you?

681
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,720
You've finally paid attention
to me?

682
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,720
And then you take away the thing
that means the most to me?

683
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,040
I liked you better
when you acted like I didn't exist.

684
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
<i>Hey.</i>

685
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,360
I didn't actually think
you would come.

686
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,560
<i>I did.</i>

687
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,600
<i>- You don't look so hot.
- Yeah.</i>

688
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,320
It's kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

689
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,440
Something pretty serious.

690
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,440
Like what? No, wait. Let me guess.

691
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,000
Cops got you on the hook
for something.

692
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,440
- Why would you think that?
- I don't know, Ryan.

693
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,280
Why would I think that?

694
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,880
I have no idea.

695
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,920
Is it maybe...

696
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,520
Because you slipped some
creepy spy tech onto my phone?

697
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Oh, no.

698
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,120
<i>I heard static and half my apps
stopped working.</i>

699
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,720
And my tech guy thinks
he deleted it, but...

700
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,840
Who knows?

701
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,120
The feds could be listening
to every word of this.

702
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,240
I... I... I did not have a choice.

703
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,560
You did, though.

704
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,600
- And you chose to snitch.
- They had a case on you.

705
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,040
You would be
in a holding cell right now.

706
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,000
That's not how this works, Ryan.

707
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,880
The cops? The Crows?

708
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,360
They're not the ones I'm afraid of.

709
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,880
You know, what? My bad, Ang.

710
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,040
I am so sorry that you can't
drug-deal in peace.

711
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,080
I am so sorry I cannot trust you...

712
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,520
Oh, don't you dare
turn this around me!

713
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,760
How do I know you don't have
this whose place bugged?

714
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,880
How do I know you're even
who you say you are?

715
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,600
Because you know me!

716
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,520
You are the only person
that knows me!

717
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,440
And I need you right now.
I really need you.

718
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,720
You should have thought of that
before you ratted me out.

719
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,840
<i>- Hello, again.</i>
- This is where I say thank you.

720
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,800
- For what?
<i>- Your advice.</i>

721
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,280
<i>The less I knew the better.</i>

722
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,920
Ocean's dead.

723
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,400
- I'll need to see his body.
<i>- And I'll bring it.</i>

724
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,000
<i>And you'll give me Kate.</i>

725
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,320
Now, send your little errand-girl
to come fetch.

726
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,720
I'll be damned.

727
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,200
You're a bigger lunatic
than I thought.

728
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,120
Thank you.
