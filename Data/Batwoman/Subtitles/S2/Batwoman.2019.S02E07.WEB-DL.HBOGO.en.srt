1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,840
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,640
Ryan's only hope is the Desert Rose,
which is on Coryana with Kate.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,560
- Who's Safiyah?
- The woman who has my daughter.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,880
We can't locate her,
but since this was

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,920
the last thing on Kate's phone,
we think it will help.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,640
The Many Arms will kill whoever
lays hands on that painting.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,320
You'll never find Coryana.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,720
The painting gets us
to Coryana? Is it a map?

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,440
It feels like my brain
is hemorrhaging.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,120
It's even nastier since yesterday.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,600
It kind of reeks, too. It kind of...

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,360
Thanks, Luke! Very helpful!

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,080
Okay. Remember a few days ago

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,440
when I deleted half the DVR
to make room for your shows?

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,080
- What?
- Just remember you like me, okay?

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,200
- What the hell just happened?
- I am trying really hard

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,000
not to seriously freak out
right now...

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,400
but I'm pretty sure the Kryptonite
just entered her brain.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,560
Not only I have to fly to Gotham

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,480
but then you make me
wade through a mile

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,400
{\an5}of rabid rats to find you?

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,920
{\an5}It's a wee bit remote

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,240
{\an5}but these types of places
kind of have to be.

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,560
{\an5}This was Ocean's smoke-out,
"wu-wu" meditation spot.

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Was?

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
As promised, Tatiana.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,400
{\an5}I think you'll find
the Ocean is dead calm.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,320
Got to admit,
I didn't think you had it in you.

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,800
{\an5}You really shouldn't be thinking
at all, Tatiana.

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,440
It's not your strong suit.

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,400
I never would have traded
that map for Alice

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,360
if I'd known I'd be forced
to hand it right back over

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
to a bunch of thugs.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,440
Some highly paid thugs, it turns out.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
{\an5}Aaron Hellzinger wanted
the Desert Rose

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,000
{\an5}to heal his damaged amygdala.

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,480
He also claimed that Hamilton doctors

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,960
{\an5}had been experimenting on his brain.

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,880
{\an5}We can assume those same doctors

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,600
{\an5}were the ones who sent him
to Mary and me for more antidote.

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,080
These are all the doctors he's seen?

42
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,560
{\an5}Yeah. Most of them work
for upstanding regional hospitals

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,040
except one,
Dr. Ethan Rogers.

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,120
{\an5}Rogers was Hellzinger's last known
neurologist, worked in a lab.

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,760
Appears to have been running
off-the-grid medical experiments.

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,560
You think Rogers was responsible
for taking the map?

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,000
{\an5}We found that Garnick
Logistics was owned

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,200
{\an5}by an offshore company
held by Hamilton Dynamics.

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,920
{\an5}It appears we have unearthed
yet another

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,120
{\an5}of Catherine's dirty, little secrets.

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,600
- Let's go get that map, sir.
- Let's go get that map.

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,080
{\an5}Good morning, my little lesbian pet.

53
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,200
What is this?

54
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,160
Oh, this? Yeah. This is story time.

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,240
{\an5}See, you are going to take me
down memoryless lane,

56
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,400
{\an5}tell me the who, what, where,
and why

57
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,280
{\an5}Ocean and I were
experiencing fleeting moments

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,840
{\an5}of forgotten memory.

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,480
Does it really matter? He's dead.

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,720
Yeah. Well, I think you'll find
you have that in common

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,280
if you don't start talking!

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,240
{\an5}Thought you'd figured it out by now.

63
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,840
{\an5}Safiyah had your memories wiped.

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,880
{\an5}I know, but Safiyah
rules over an island.

65
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,920
I was an orphan runaway.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
What was so threatening
about little old me?

67
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,720
{\an5}To understand what made you
a threat...

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,520
{\an5}you have to understand
what made you appealing.

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,280
{\an5}You and Safiyah
had a common enemy.

70
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,960
{\an5}Catherine Hamilton? I remember.

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,800
{\an5}After Catherine burned Safiyah
on an island defense system

72
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,400
{\an5}Safiyah instructed us
to steal one of her yachts

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,760
{\an5}to teach her a lesson.

74
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,920
{\an5}Turns out, vengeful minds think alike

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,960
{\an5}because we found you
stowed away in the cabin

76
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,000
{\an5}wearing her clothes, swilling
her five-figure bottles of champagne.

77
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,800
- Why the hell am I here?
- Can I kill her now?

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,560
Leave us, please.

79
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,440
She's a filthy outsider.

80
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,320
- We have no use for her.
- She is my prisoner.

81
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
I will deal with her my way.

82
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,240
You fought off four of my men
before we put you down.

83
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,040
To me, you were a feral animal.

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,120
But to Safiyah,
you were something else.

85
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,320
You were special.

86
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,240
And from the looks
of what you did to my men...

88
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,960
I wouldn't stand a chance.

89
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,640
Why am I here?

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,560
What do you want?

91
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,000
First, I'd like to know
why a beautiful, young woman

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,840
with her entire life ahead of her
was found sequestered away on a boat

93
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,840
floating in the middle of nowhere.

94
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,400
Let's just say I've grown accustomed
to small spaces.

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,040
The real world can be
an overwhelming place, sometimes.

96
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,440
I understand we both have
a bone to pick

97
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,200
with Catherine Hamilton-Kane.

98
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,040
She convinced my entire family

99
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,320
I was dead while I spent
the last 11 years

100
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,920
in my kidnapper's basement cell.

101
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,280
And here you are...

102
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,800
a siren once trapped in a net...

103
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,920
who somehow found her way out.

104
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,040
Safiyah liked you
because she was inspired by you.

105
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,400
Whatever story you told her
of your captivity,

106
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,640
you did the one thing
she never could...

107
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,440
Escape.
She would never admit it,

108
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,320
but to this day, she considers
herself a prisoner of Coryana.

109
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,680
Poor thing.

110
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,120
It must be so hard
being handed a kingdom.

111
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,880
But I remember all of this.

112
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,520
When did Ocean factor in?

113
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,360
When Safiyah realized
you had purpose.

114
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,520
Technically, you were our prisoner.

115
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,760
But she wanted to harness
the rage you had for Catherine

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,360
by making you one of her
loyal soldiers...

117
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,880
except you were
an untamed and angry girl.

118
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,000
You needed discipline.

119
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,720
And Safiyah knew exactly
who would teach you

120
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,960
how to be a good, little soldier.

121
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,480
Ocean.

122
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,920
Hi.

123
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,200
Hi.

124
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,760
<i>There are very few rules
on our island</i>

125
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,400
no leaving,
no stealing the Desert Rose,

126
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,640
and if Safiyah wants something,
she gets it.

127
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,120
And Safiyah wanted your loyalty
so that after you went home to Gotham

128
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,520
to get revenge against your family
you would come back and join hers.

129
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
And what did I want?

130
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,680
You wanted Ocean.

131
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,880
Hey. Come here.

132
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,400
Sophie thinks they might know
who took the map.

133
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,200
They're bringing an army
of Crows to his work.

134
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
So, what happens next?
Does Ryan suit up

135
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,800
and jump on the jet with them?

136
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,280
No.
She's never gonna make it.

137
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,600
She has acute radiation.
Her bone marrow is disintegrating.

138
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,440
Her circulatory system is failing.

139
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,080
Okay. So, what do you suggest?

140
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,560
I think we need to ask my dad
to bring a flower back with Kate.

141
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,760
If he finds the map
and if he gets there in time,

142
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,880
not to mention, Mary, that the man
just shut down your clinic.

143
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
- I know.
- How do you think he'll react

144
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
to finding out
that you're on the Bat team?

145
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm still in the brainstorming phase.
I...

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, no.

147
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Ryan!

148
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,600
So you're telling me that...

149
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,480
A little crush on the first,
cute boy I laid eyes on

150
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,880
after escaping captivity for 11 years
threw the island queen into a tizzy?

151
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,240
It wasn't like that.

152
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,720
In fact, at first,
no one even noticed.

153
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,080
Let me guess,
clandestine trysts by the water well?

154
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,200
No.

155
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,160
The reason no one noticed
was because you two hated each other.

156
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,960
Now, use my weight against me.

157
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,160
- The game is never over.
- What's the point of this?

158
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,640
Has anyone ever heard of a gun?

159
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,800
Guns can jam, get taken.

160
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,400
The real fight is in here,
and that, they can't take away.

161
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,960
Preparation, engagement, commitment.

162
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,400
Surrendering to false gods
and ideologies.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,120
What's that supposed to mean?

164
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,640
It means there is a whole world

165
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,000
outside this island
that you know nothing about...

166
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,720
Books, food, electricity
and Safiyah likes to keep it that way

167
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,640
so that you stay close
and loyal and uninspired.

168
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,600
As the weeks passed,

169
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,960
you two became each other's
sparring partners.

170
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,800
I think Safiyah will like you.

171
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
This is a waste of time.
You're not even trying.

172
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,120
- You're wasting your own time.
- Well, if it's all the same to you,

173
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,920
I'd rather waste my time
and go get drunk.

174
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
What do you really want?

175
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,800
Revenge? Why?

176
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
Because your family moved
on after more than a decade?

177
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,360
Catherine Hamilton
lied through her teeth

178
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,520
so they would forget me.

179
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Or maybe she did them a favor.

180
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,640
You said they looked for a year.

181
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,680
You weren't gonna be found.
What were they supposed to do?

182
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,400
Sit around and be miserable
for the next decade?

183
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,840
Is that really what you wanted?

184
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,560
The family you supposedly
love and miss so much?

185
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't need to learn
how to fight, Alice.

186
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,520
You need to learn how to feel.

187
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Baby...

188
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,040
Are you sure you want
to be going where you're going?

189
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,960
You know, I have faith
in your decision-making.

190
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,320
All I'm cautioning is be mindful
the company you keep.

191
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,280
Other people judge your friends.

192
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Mama...

193
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,160
Angelique is a good person.

194
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
She also gets in trouble

195
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,560
and I don't want you getting roped
into her drama.

196
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,840
You were put on this earth
for bigger and better things, child.

197
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,240
I know.
You tell me this every day.

198
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Mama?

199
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,840
What the...

200
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,760
- What happened?
- Why'd you stop?

201
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Mama.

202
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,520
Mama, what happened?

203
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,720
Batwoman, do you copy? Batwoman!

204
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,960
She just hit 92 miles per hour,
and she's not answering her comms.

205
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,080
Where the hell is she going?

206
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
She's headed towards the west end.
What the hell's up there?

207
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,280
- Oh, no.
- What?

208
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,440
- Of course, that's where she went.
- Where? Where's she going?

209
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
Her brain isn't working,
so she turned to her heart.

210
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
What?

211
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Oh, my God!

212
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,160
What the actual hell?

213
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,360
- Angie. Angelique.
- How do you know my name?

214
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,840
And are... are you okay?

215
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,800
I...

216
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,560
Hey.
Where's your wine opener?

217
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Oh, my God!

218
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,280
- She doesn't drink.
- I don't drink.

219
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm sorry. How do you know my life?

220
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,840
Angie, what is going on?

221
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
- Angie.
- Shouldn't you be out,

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,160
like, fighting crime?

223
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm looking for your friend...

224
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,560
Ocean.

225
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,880
- Can I have two seconds?
- Okay.

226
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,600
Sorry. No, idea,
who you're talking about.

227
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,640
Maybe you know what this is.

228
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
What are you gonna do, slash me?

229
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,960
Look. The dude grows shrooms
in a concrete jungle.

230
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,040
If you can't find him, maybe
you shouldn't quit your day job.

231
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,000
Or I'll haul your ass into the cops,

232
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,720
and I'll let them sweat it out
of you.

233
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,120
All right. Fine. You got me.
You'll find him in Coventry.

234
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,800
I'll give you a head start.

235
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Grab her legs.

236
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,200
<i>This is the Gotham City
Police Department.</i>

237
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,120
<i>Stop and back away from the suspect.</i>

238
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,640
<i>I repeat. Back away from the suspect.</i>

239
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,560
<i>You are interfering
in a police response.</i>

240
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,440
<i>Freeze. You are under arrest
and ordered not to move.</i>

241
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,640
<i>- Repeat. You are under arrest...</i>
- I'll meet you in the Batcave.

242
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,560
- Why are you giving me the keys?
- I have to take the Batmobile.

243
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,400
- I can take the Batmobile.
- You've never driven it before.

244
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,400
- I've never driven your car before.
- Mary, no!

245
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,960
- Yes! Yes!
- No! Mary!

246
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,920
- Yes!
<i>- Release the suspect...</i>

247
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,040
- We don't have time for this.
- Give me, give me!

248
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,160
<i>- You are under arrest and ordered...</i>
- Hell, yeah!

249
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,680
Mama?

250
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Mama.

251
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,600
Why are you here?
Why did you do this to us?

252
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,840
You must be mad...

253
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,360
or you wouldn't have come here.

254
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,640
Why did you kill her?
What was the point?

255
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,080
You know how much
pain you caused me?

256
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,520
How do you do that?

257
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,480
How do you just murder someone's mom
and move on like it doesn't matter?

258
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,000
Tell me you remember her!

259
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,880
Tell me her name!

260
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Cora.

261
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,360
Cora Lewis.

262
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,040
What are you doing?

263
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,880
I'm getting the justice...

264
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,560
My mother deserves.

265
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,360
Okay. Okay.
So I hid the Batmobile keys in Dino,

266
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,080
and I'm putting an extra tracker
in her gauntlet cuffs

267
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,400
in case
she decides to run off again

268
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,200
and thinks to turn off her GPS.
What are you doing?

269
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,680
I'm mixing two
complementary cardiotonics

270
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,560
to calm down her mind
and speed up her system

271
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,320
and hopefully, pull her out
of these hallucinations

272
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,560
but, this isn't gonna last.

273
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,440
And since I don't have access
to my clinic anymore,

274
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm gonna need a few supplies.

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,080
Okay. Great. So, do I
look like Postmates, or...

276
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,200
No, nor do you look like a doctor...

277
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,000
which is who needs to stay
with her right now,

278
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,280
unless you want to give it a shot.

279
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,240
You know, put her life
in your hands just for funsies?

280
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,680
Okay. I'll be back.

281
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,040
Save some for the fishies.

282
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,920
So, Safiyah and I shared
a common enemy.

283
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,400
She thought I'd be a good soldier

284
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,200
and I started to hate-crush
her metaphorical brother.

285
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,360
Call me old-fashioned

286
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
but I'm missing the motive
for a lobotomy.

287
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,480
You're really not getting it,
are you?

288
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,040
Well, you're not exactly
unfolding the plot

289
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,520
to a Shakespearean drama here.

290
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,720
Safiyah would claim
she wanted you for her army.

291
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,280
Survival instincts would make you
an excellent fighter and advisor.

292
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,200
- And what would you claim?
- That she was in love with you.

293
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,800
I heard there was wine.

294
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,240
Sounds like training's going well.

295
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,520
I have yet to see
the point of an army.

296
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,720
You have no crime here,
everyone walks around with a smile.

297
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,280
I'm in Roman Pleasantville.

298
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,200
That's actually
why I invited you here...

299
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,120
to tell you about the Desert Rose.

300
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,600
It's delicate and vibrant,
and in the wrong hands

301
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,640
one of the most dangerous
weapons in the world.

302
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
This?

303
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,880
Its serum can cure illness,
hereditary disease.

304
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,840
It can expunge toxins, pathogens.

305
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,320
This simple flower
is a miracle cure-all, Alice.

306
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,440
And it's my birthright
to protect it at all costs.

307
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,280
- Hence the army.
- Hence the army.

308
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,040
On occasion,

309
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,280
word of a mystical flower
on a faraway island

310
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,440
draws unwanted attention.

311
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,560
If outsiders were able
to come take it,

312
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,920
we'd be left with nothing

313
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,040
and our sanctuary would be destroyed.

314
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,600
Why don't you just grow more?

315
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,800
According to the lore, centuries ago,
the women of a village in Europe

316
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,480
banded together to escape
their abusive husbands.

317
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,880
They'd heard tell of an island

318
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,280
under the constellations
of Cassiopeia and Andromeda,

319
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,080
and they fled here
with their children in tow.

320
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,560
Months later, the men
they escaped tracked them down.

321
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,000
As their ships landed...

322
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,360
the men were met
by a ferocious female army.

323
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,480
The women succeeded in driving
the men back into the sea.

324
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,640
However, it was at great cost.

325
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,800
Many women lay dead, slaughtered.

326
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,840
Only my ancestors
and a few others survived.

327
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,040
The next day,
a field of Roses bloomed

328
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,240
in the very spot of the battle.

329
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,720
The women claimed the blood
that had been spilled was sacred.

330
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,560
Its protective feminine
essence enriched the land.

331
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,720
They wrote that only
a woman's life force

332
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,800
could birth this medicine
destined to save mankind.

333
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
She knew she couldn't tell you
how she felt

334
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,760
so she showed you.

335
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,080
She entrusted you
with her most valued secret.

336
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,280
And someone was a little jealous?

337
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,080
You weren't a threat to me, Alice.

338
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,440
You were a threat
to the entire island of Coryana.

339
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,560
Not even, like, a teeny,
weeny, itty, bitty bit jealous?

340
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,680
I'm Safiyah's right hand.

341
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,040
It's my job to tell her
when there's a fox in the henhouse.

342
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,800
- So, you think I'm a fox?
- I think you're a distraction.

343
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,040
I think you're in love with her.

344
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,880
You are such a child.

345
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,480
Well, you're the one who can't
admit you're in love with her.

346
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,280
Of course, I'm in love with her!

347
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,240
And you'd better believe
that when the first opportunity arose

348
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,960
for me to destroy you...

349
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,240
I did not hesitate.

350
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,880
Let's go, let's go!

351
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,320
Got to wonder if Catherine
ever wandered these halls.

352
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,040
Guess there's a lot you
didn't know about her.

353
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,840
Well, apparently,
it runs in the family.

354
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,400
Turns out Mary was operating
an illegal medical clinic

355
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,800
out of a church basement.

356
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,520
Really? That's...

357
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,080
Did you know?

358
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,000
- Sir...
- You got to be kidding me.

359
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,760
No, one wants to tell me
anything around here.

360
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,560
Because I knew you'd shut it down.

361
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,880
That place was her life.
She helped a lot of people.

362
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,480
Have you two spoken since?

363
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,680
I refuse to let her turn
into her mother.

364
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,000
Catherine cut a lot
of corners at Hamilton.

365
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,200
Look where it got us.

366
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,840
I'll take that as a no.

367
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,200
<i>Synthetic granulocytes.</i>

368
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,760
- My God.
<i>- Now, injecting them in patient B,</i>

369
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,840
<i>an 80-year-old male
with a similar cancer.</i>

370
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,320
<i>Our hypothesis
is that the new solution</i>

371
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,760
- Dr. Rogers.
- So much for our lead.

372
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,040
<i>So, we'll check back in 24 hours
and look for progress.</i>

373
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,440
<i>Help! Just calm down, breathe.</i>

374
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,160
<i>Help! We need help in here!</i>

375
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
<i>Try to breathe.</i>

376
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,680
What the hell are we dealing with?

377
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,080
Ryan, can you hear me?

378
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,640
This Kryptonite
gives a worse hangover

379
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,200
than two-dollar tequila.

380
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,040
Wait. How did I get back here?

381
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
Luke and I found you outside
of Angelique's.

382
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,760
Yeah. But good news,
I got to drive the Batmobile.

383
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,080
Bad news, the wipers button
and the rocket launchers

384
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,040
look very similar.

385
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,400
Someone should label those.

386
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,520
What did you do?

387
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,480
I should be asking you that, missy.

388
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
Why'd you go to Angelique's
in the Batsuit?

389
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,640
I needed a lead on Ocean.

390
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,600
You're dying, and you waste
your last gasps of energy on him?

391
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,320
No. I find Ocean, I find Alice
so I can hear her last gasp.

392
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,520
- Ryan.
- No. I am not going down

393
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,880
without getting justice
for both of our moms.

394
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,320
Let's just get some more
fluids in you first

395
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,560
and then we can talk bucket list.

396
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,880
- This is Roger's office.
- We looked into the deceased...

397
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,520
and everyone seems
to have been involved

398
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,280
in the experiments
with the Desert Rose.

399
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,120
My guess is they were trying
to create more and failed.

400
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,320
Coryana sent their assassins
to cover their tracks.

401
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,600
I believe Safiyah calls them
The Many Arms of Death.

402
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,080
Let's just hope they didn't find
the map that Rogers stole.

403
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,960
It has to be around here
somewhere.

404
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Hang on.

405
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Bingo.

406
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,800
They beat us to it.

407
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Sir.

408
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,400
They have my Kate, damn it.

409
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,200
I can't stand losing another daughter
like this.

410
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,640
When I was being held in that cell,

411
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,200
my father and sister
came looking for me.

412
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,960
I was told if I made a sound,
they'd be shot.

413
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,560
But Kate, my...

414
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,280
my twin, she found my cell.

415
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,840
And I heard her
put her hand on the door

416
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,160
so I did the same.

417
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,880
And I just stood there...

418
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,240
silently praying that she would...

419
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,040
feel me.

420
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,280
And she never did?

421
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,040
You asked why I want revenge.

422
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,040
It's because I can't forget
moments like that.

423
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Then don't.

424
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,120
But do you really want to spend

425
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,160
the rest of your life trying
to get her to apologize?

426
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,120
Because that's not how this works.

427
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,160
She's your sister.

428
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,200
She will spend every waking moment
trying to fix it, to fix you...

429
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,320
and she can't.
Only you can do that.

430
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,600
You got out,
you got your second chance.

431
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,720
Let it go.

432
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,720
Be happy.

433
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,840
You make that sound so...

434
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,000
- So easy.
- It is.

435
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,040
At least, it is now.

436
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,800
Desert Rose snips.
I'll plant them, nurture them...

437
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
feed them blood so they bloom.

438
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,320
Pretty soon, all of mankind
will have its miracle drug,

439
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,840
and I'll have money
to travel the world.

440
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,880
You are not supposed to have those.

441
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,320
There's a lot Safiyah
tells us we can't have.

442
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,560
I want to do what you did.

443
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,960
I want to escape,
I want to start over

444
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,200
and experience life outside
this island.

445
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,680
And I want you to come with me.

446
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,920
The man you were willing
to change your life for.

447
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,240
The one person who offered
you a second chance

448
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,520
and freedom from your past

449
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,600
is the same man Safiyah
convinced you to stab

450
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,760
through the heart.

451
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,240
I'm sorry. That's it?
That's your big mic drop moment?

452
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,000
"Surprise! You killed your soul mate
that you don't even remember."

453
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,720
Yeah. I found my mother's
head in a freezer.

454
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,600
So, if you're trying to shock me

455
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,880
you're gonna have to do
a little better than that.

456
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,520
Don't you think you
should be lying down?

457
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,360
Angelique said he grew shrooms

458
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,080
in a concrete jungle,
meaning he would need

459
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,000
some type of indoor forest.

460
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,920
That means a neighborhood
with a high moisture level.

461
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,880
- North side, by the water.
- Wait. What?

462
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,440
He'd have to block out his windows,
wouldn't want questions asked,

463
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,320
and he'd have to draw
a crapload of power

464
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,600
for all those grow lamps.

465
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,200
- The grow lamps.
- Ryan, you need to lie down.

466
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
I need to find Alice.

467
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,320
No. I... I can't let you kill Alice.

468
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,720
- Do you love your mom?
- Of course, I do.

469
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,720
Do you believe in what we do here?

470
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,120
You know, I do.

471
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,000
Then how can we stand behind
this symbol

472
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,320
and claim we fight for justice

473
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,520
and we stand up for victims
and we protect our streets

474
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,160
with a legitimate
serial-killing psychopath out there?

475
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,680
Living, breathing...

476
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,560
looking for a way to find your sister

477
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,080
- and kill her, too?
- And we will stop her!

478
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,200
When? When two Crows bring me
some miracle flower

479
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
from an island we can't get to?

480
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,440
- That's what I was...
- Did they find the map?

481
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,600
Did they find the map?

482
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,480
The map's gone.

483
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,400
Alice took our moms from us, Mary.

484
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,120
Do you ever, for a second

485
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,880
think about what your life
would be like

486
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
if she were still here?

487
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,360
If she could be proud
of you for one more day,

488
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,240
if you could ask her for advice

489
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,040
or tell her about a crush
or hear her tell you she loves you?

490
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,440
A million times a day.

491
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,200
I am as good as dead, Mary.

492
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,440
And I am not leaving here
without getting justice.

493
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
So...

494
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,440
you can step out of my way
and let me do my thing

495
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,000
or I can go through you.

496
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,440
Keys are in Dino.

497
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
What are you doing?

498
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,400
- Packing up. We're done.
- You don't want to know more?

499
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,480
What's to know?

500
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,720
Safiyah got jealous, so she took away
my memory of Ocean to punish me.

501
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,400
I could have saved a lot of time
by reading the back of the book.

502
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,560
It wasn't as simple as plucking
out just those memories.

503
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,360
There was collateral damage.

504
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,920
I never thought I'd see the day
that a man I considered a brother

505
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,400
would be kneeling
before me a betrayer of his island

506
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,760
and his people!

507
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,920
That flower is everything to us,

508
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,800
that which defines us,

509
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
that which is the key
to our survival!

510
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,120
Safiyah, we both know
this isn't about a stupid flower.

511
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,880
And what do you think it's about?

512
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,680
Me having the one thing you can't.

513
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Alice is a snake
that slithered into our garden.

514
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,600
Let me kill her.

515
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,520
We're not killing anyone.

516
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,960
I'm going to visit
a punishment upon her

517
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,680
that fits the crime.

518
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,360
Find Enigma, bring her to me.

519
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,440
Safiyah, no. You can't do this.

520
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,200
Yes, my queen.

521
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,680
You wanted to take the one thing
that was precious to me.

522
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,200
I will take
what's most precious to you...

523
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,920
each other.

524
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,960
- Who's Enigma?
- A hypnotist.

525
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,040
She wants to screw with our heads.

526
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,960
You're not a snake, Alice.

527
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,640
You're just a broken little girl
who sought refuge from her trauma

528
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,640
by escaping into a fantastical book!

529
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,280
I know the big, wild world
seemed daunting to you.

530
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,920
I was going to show you how easily
you could rise and thrive!

531
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,120
But instead, you turned to him
for solace and rehabilitation.

532
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,880
She didn't do anything wrong.

533
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,400
You are going to go home, Alice.

534
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,720
You are going to embrace
this fairytale persona of yours,

535
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,880
and you're going to imbue it
with fury!

536
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,640
You will build your own army.

537
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
You will become your own queen

538
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,240
and you will carry out
the vengeance on your family

539
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,280
that you so desperately crave.

540
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,480
And you'll forget all about Ocean
and your love for each other!

541
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,040
Don't do this, Safiyah.

542
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,680
With the memories came

543
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,800
the love and humanity
that was bubbling up inside of you.

544
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,840
Safiyah took that and in turn,
activated this...

545
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,000
Cold, hard...

546
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,480
vengeance-obsessed killing machine.

547
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,480
You would have run away with Ocean
and started a new life,

548
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,280
happy, free, in love.

549
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,240
Instead,
Safiyah turned you into herself.

550
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,400
You look upset.
Shakespearean enough for you?

551
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Take the body.

552
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,400
I'll call you for my pickup.

553
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,960
Where are you going?

554
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,600
Oh, I'm not requesting
an audience with the queen

555
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,000
dressed like this.

556
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,360
- Gotcha.
- Enigma did this?

557
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Of course.

558
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,480
She's a hypnotist.
Owed Safiyah a favor.

559
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,600
Safiyah and her legion
of lady loyalists.

560
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,040
Tatiana found out you were
stealing the Desert Rose.

561
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,320
Good riddance.
That flower's meant to save lives,

562
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,880
yet it destroys everything
it touches.

563
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
And...

564
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,560
I guess this is it.

565
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,040
There's a bar in Portofino
I've always wanted to try.

566
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,680
Cobblestone Streets,
view of the Harbor.

567
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
What about you? What now?

568
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,040
Now, I'm off to Coryana
to get my final revenge on my sister.

569
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,400
Unless...

570
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,200
You have a reason to stop me.

571
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,440
Live your life.

572
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
See you, Alice.

573
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,640
Where's Ryan?

574
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,160
My dad couldn't find the map,
so there's no way to find Coryana.

575
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,560
Why are her comms off? Where is she?

576
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,080
- She's gonna die.
- Mary, where is Ryan?

577
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,400
Alice, do you know who I am?

578
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,040
Okay. I've had a day.

579
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,560
Can we do this in, say...

580
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,360
two, three weeks?

581
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,400
Do you know who I am?

582
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,240
Honestly, so many women
keep showing up

583
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,200
in that outfit, it's impossible
to keep track.

584
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,680
How's this?

585
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,640
You killed my mom,
and now I'm here to kill you.

586
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,200
You're kidding, right?

587
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,680
That's what this is about?

588
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,160
My mom was Cora Lewis.

589
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,160
Your gang beat her to death
on December 13, 2015.

590
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,440
I get it. Mommy died,
and now you're a woman on fire

591
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,640
which means, I'm responsible
for spawning

592
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,680
not one Batwoman but two.

593
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,720
- You think this is funny?
- Yes.

594
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,120
My mom meant everything to me!

595
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,920
I have no memory of your mommy.

596
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Liar!

597
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,280
Did you hurt yourself?
Is that my fault, too?

598
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,440
- I wasn't the one who killed her.
- Your army did.

599
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,400
Because of you,
because you turned them

600
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,920
into coldblooded killers!

601
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,640
Ryan! This isn't the girl I raised.

602
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,760
But she killed you.

603
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,440
I don't know what made you
this way...

604
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,320
but you're not worth it.

605
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,680
You'll never be worth it.

606
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,280
- It wasn't my fault.
- Everything's your fault.

607
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,480
Now, leave.

608
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,480
No sign of Alice anywhere, sir.

609
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,240
You know, I figured out
why Catherine lied

610
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,880
and said that Beth was dead.

611
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,520
She was doing me a favor.

612
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,960
The only thing worse
than losing one of your children

613
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,240
is the cycle of waking up
every morning

614
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,120
with hope
and then having it ripped away

615
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,880
and losing them all over again
by dinner.

616
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Sir, you really should
get some sleep.

617
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,160
I won't sleep
until I have my family back.

618
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,880
- This must be the airport shuttle.
- Get in.

619
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,520
Air Coryana terminal, jeevsy.

620
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Where's Alice?

621
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,840
Hello, to you, too.

622
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,360
Well, I realized killing her
would only

623
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,720
make me more like her.

624
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,200
Kind of went along
with what you guys were saying.

625
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,440
Great. So, where is she?

626
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,400
- I let her go.
- What? Okay.

627
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,760
There's not killing, but
there's still apprehending.

628
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,440
We need her to go to Coryana.

629
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,080
No, we don't. She'll kill Kate.

630
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,400
I'll stop her.

631
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,120
I put a tracker in her boot.

632
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,000
We follow her,
we find Coryana...

633
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,760
we save Kate.

634
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,640
And we get you the Desert Rose.
