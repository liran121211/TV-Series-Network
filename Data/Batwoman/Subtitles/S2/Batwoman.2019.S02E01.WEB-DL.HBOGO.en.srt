1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,880
<i>Last season on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,760
No, no, no.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,120
Kate, don't leave me! Don't leave me.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,080
<i>I want her very, very dead!</i>

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,720
If you want Kate so badly,
why don't you just shoot her?

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,840
No.
Her betrayal deserves a reckoning!

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,440
- Where did you get that?
- A friend gave it to me

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,040
for safekeeping
in case she ever lost her way.

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,200
Goody. It's Tommy Elliot.

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,480
What about me?
I'm the guy that taught Bruce Wayne

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,320
everything he knows,
so where's my recognition, doc?

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,440
I must admit, Tommy.
I made all your dreams come true.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,960
You made me Bruce Wayne.

14
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,280
I need you to strut through
the doors of Wayne tower

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,400
and get me that shard of kryptonite
from your dear cousin, Kate.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,360
I think you'll like it here.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,560
There's plenty of room
for your stuff

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,440
and your plants
will have their own balcony.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,160
Yes, I said, balcony and look!

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,120
Only two locks.
We are a two-lock household now, mom.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,240
Aren't we fancy?

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,960
And your little girlfriends
will have an easier time

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,080
sneaking in and out now.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,520
Okay.
Can we not? You are my mama.

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,080
You're not supposed to know
about that stuff.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,320
Rent's due on the first.
My office is next to the laundry.

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,560
Are you ready for our new life?

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,520
I did not just see that.

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Holy...

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
Okay. This is freaky.

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,920
Apparently, Gotham's
raining jet parts.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,680
- Already on it.
- Is Kate there?

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,920
She hasn't checked in
since she landed

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,240
in national city yesterday.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,360
Batcave to Batwoman. You online?

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,000
Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello?

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,840
Hello?

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,080
Can anybody moan or something?

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,200
- The suit's GPS is off.
- So is her phone.

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,040
What about calling her old-school,
Bat-signal?

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,760
Can we flip it on remotely?

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,760
We could
till the crows pulled it offline

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,040
in their war with Batwoman.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,040
Now, anyone who touches
the thing loses a hand.

45
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,760
- Want to try the hold-up?
- Already calling.

46
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Wake up.

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,240
Come on. Live!

48
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,760
Live!

49
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,800
Come on! Wake up!
Live, please!

50
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Come on!

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,960
Why isn't she answering?

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,320
Maybe she's already at the scene.

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,480
With her comms off?

54
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,080
You sure she flew in
from national city this morning?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Checking.

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,440
Hey, hey.

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
You're gonna be okay, okay?

58
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
You're gonna be okay.

59
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,320
Wayne Enterprises tail number GC9K23
was set to depart at 10.00am.

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,720
From national city.

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,680
- Delayed for weather.
- Maybe she's still in national city.

62
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,400
Tail number GC9K23
actual departure time...

63
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,680
9.35pm.

64
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,400
So, she's en route.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,880
Explains why she hasn't gotten
any of our calls.

66
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Except she was set to land
20 minutes ago.

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Hello?

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,080
Okay. GC9K23 departed at 9.35pm.

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,200
At 10.15, 10,000, feet, 400 knots.

70
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,720
At 10.45, 415 knots, 85,00 feet.

71
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,120
At 10.50...

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
What?

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,160
10.50 what?

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,440
What, Luke?

75
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Luke?

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,200
Where is Kate's plane?

77
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,240
Oh, my god.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,520
Why don't you guys start there?

79
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,360
Okay. Kane's here.

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,840
{\an5}Listen. Go now that way
and check in with me later.

81
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,120
- What have you found?
- Sir, I don't think

82
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,480
you should be anywhere around here
right now.

83
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,160
{\an5}This was my daughter's airplane.
Tell me what you have.

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,800
{\an5}- Have you recovered anyone?
- Not yet, but trust me,

85
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,080
{\an5}Kane, go home.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,240
{\an5}We'll call you if we find anything.

87
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
{\an5}I am not leaving here
without my daughter.

88
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Sir.

89
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
We'll look together.

90
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Come on.

91
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
{\an5}You two, with me.

92
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,080
What do you mean Julia
couldn't find the batsuit?

93
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,040
{\an5}Julia said she was one of the first
to arrive at the crash site,

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,400
searched everywhere, meaning if Kate
was wearing it she could've survived.

95
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,920
{\an5}No, but Kate would have called us,
though.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,080
{\an5}Not if she's unconscious,

97
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,440
{\an5}so when the suit wakes up,
we'll find her.

98
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,720
{\an5}I get that it's a supersuit,

99
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,680
{\an5}but 10,000, feet
is still a hell of a freefall.

100
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,280
Yeah, but the cape's nanotech
is more advanced

101
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
{\an5}than a NASA parachute,

102
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,560
{\an5}and the suit's shock-absorbing
properties are unlike anything...

103
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,080
No way.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
- Bruce.
- I came as soon as I heard.

105
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,760
It's been four years, Bruce.
Where have you been?

106
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,960
{\an5}If only the answer was as simple
as the question, Mini Fox.

107
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,400
Complicated's fine. We're smart.

108
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,040
I know. Let's find Kate
and then I'll tell you all about it.

109
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
{\an5}It's my dad.

110
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,880
{\an5}I should check in
but I really don't want to leave.

111
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,240
{\an5}No. He needs you, Mary.

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,920
{\an5}You should go. We'll stay in touch.

113
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,560
{\an5}If anyone can help us, it's you.

114
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,480
{\an5}Barely changed the place.

115
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
{\an5}You should probably see The Batcave.

116
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,880
{\an5}Yeah, I probably should.

117
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Want the honors?

118
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,240
{\an5}Not sure we have time
for a Proust read-along.

119
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,600
{\an5}Hilarious. You can go right ahead.

120
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
{\an5}You okay?

121
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,560
{\an5}You've been the man of the castle
for sometime now.

122
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
{\an5}Lead on.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
{\an5}Okay.

124
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,160
Just like old times, right?

125
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,480
So, Ryan, what's new?

126
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,160
Anything I should I know about?

127
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,600
Actually...

128
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,320
I stumbled on something pretty sick,
kind of a game changer.

129
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,680
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

130
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,200
Was it housing?

131
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,480
No. It was not housing.

132
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,560
Okay. What about employment?

133
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,200
All those years
teaching martial arts,

134
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,760
surely there's a dojo
that will hire you.

135
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,360
Still looking.

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,920
Tell me you paid your court fines.

137
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,280
You make it sound
like these are all my choices.

138
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,520
They are your choices, Ryan.

139
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,840
You have the power
to turn this around.

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,400
You want to know
why I haven't paid my fines?

141
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,560
Because I can't find a job
because I don't have a home

142
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,200
because no landlord wants to rent
to an ex-con on post-release.

143
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,640
You see how this works?

144
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,440
No one cares
that the dope wasn't mine

145
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,480
or... or that the crows were dirty
or that I'm actually a decent human.

146
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,720
I am a file in your cabinet.

147
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,680
That is not having power.

148
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,000
That is the very definition
of powerless.

149
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,840
Mind if I join you?

150
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
I'd prefer it.

151
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Any news?

152
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Nothing.

153
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,240
- How you holding up?
- I'm not.

154
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,880
The basement vending machine
can attest.

155
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,600
We're not finding her alive, are we?

156
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,040
Oh, I'm not giving up yet.

157
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,920
Investigators said
the plane was flying

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,680
with a recalled engine part.

159
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,000
I heard the same thing.

160
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,320
Do you believe that?

161
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,800
Clear skies,
the pilot's psych eval checks out.

162
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,200
Because a few days ago,

163
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,960
you showed me photographs
of us being tailed

164
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,000
by some mysterious woman
named Safiyah.

165
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,240
You two had drama
and I ended up in her crosshairs.

166
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,120
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you and Kate

167
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
were close, too.

168
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,640
Who's to say she didn't have
the same photographs of her?

169
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Julia,

170
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,080
if you know something
about Kate's plane being targeted...

171
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
I know what you know.

172
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,560
But, sir,
we've barely started our search.

173
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
I can send more men.

174
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,680
This is my daughter, commissioner.
I am not giving up.

175
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,960
That sounded awful.

176
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,640
They I.D.ed the pilot.

177
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,840
His hand washed up in the harbor.

178
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,560
They think Kate's in the river.

179
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,200
But they're guessing,
They don't... Know anything.

180
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,720
They've shifted the search
from rescue to recovery.

181
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Who?

182
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,960
The same people who convinced you
to stop looking for Beth

183
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,280
when she went missing?

184
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,840
Dad, we can't listen to them.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,280
How is this happening all over again?

186
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Hey.

187
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,600
You and I, we both know
that crazier things have happened.

188
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,920
I'm not gonna lose hope

189
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,560
and I'm not gonna
let you lose it either.

190
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,840
Okay.

191
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,600
Okay, for the record,

192
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,880
Kate found it all on her own
and Batwoman was her idea.

193
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,400
Well, Kate's not the type to sit idle
while her sister's upending Gotham.

194
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,200
Wait, hold up.
You know Alice is Beth?

195
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Of course.

196
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
They are my cousins.

197
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,160
Red accents are a choice.
Bruce, come on.

198
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,640
Why didn't you call or... or write
or answer one of my 3,000 texts?

199
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,840
Because for every Alice, Kate had,
I had 20,

200
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,520
all trying to find a way to kill me
and everyone I cared about.

201
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Protecting you
meant not letting you in.

202
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,000
Sticky bomb launcher.

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
Your old man knew what he was doing,

204
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,520
although I would have preferred
the suit stay fully impenetrable.

205
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,000
Trust me. That makes two of us.

206
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,360
In fact, this is why Kate flew
to national city,

207
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,760
to ask Kara Danvers
if we could destroy

208
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,400
one stupid piece of kryptonite
before it got into the wrong hands.

209
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,920
The only material on earth

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,920
strong enough
to penetrate the batsuit.

211
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,080
I should probably hold onto this.

212
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Look. I wanted it gone, okay?

213
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,320
-I, I, I thought I could protect her.
- Hey, hey, hey.

214
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,120
We'll find her, okay?

215
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,080
Wait. Where's the suit?

216
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,480
<i>Can't you feel it coming?</i>

217
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Never again.

218
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,080
Time to be powerful.

219
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,600
Hey! Show yourself!

220
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,560
I did not think that through.

221
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm bulletproof, bitches!

222
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,880
Wait. What the...?

223
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Kate.

224
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,160
What is this, some wanna be?

225
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,640
Sorry. Legit didn't mean that.

226
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,600
Sorry? You freaking shot me!

227
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Look.

228
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,760
I'm looking for someone.

229
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,920
Figure the false face society
knows things.

230
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,400
So, who's gonna point me
in the right direction?

231
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,200
I have no idea what this button does.

232
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,880
You want to figure it out together
or you want to help?

233
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,920
Not tomorrow.

234
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,760
I got to hand it to you, Tommy.

235
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,600
What the hell are you doing here?

236
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,200
I gave you the face
but you nailed the voice

237
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,600
and now Gotham's most
eligible bachelor's playing find

238
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,880
the tan lines while I... Flail...

239
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,560
Aimlessly.

240
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,320
Can't say I didn't hold up
my end of the deal.

241
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,080
The only thing stronger
than the batsuit

242
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,560
which Mini Fox is in the process
of retrieving and very soon,

243
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,720
the world will call me Batman.

244
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,000
Do you want a parade?

245
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,280
Because I'm pretty sure my sister

246
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
is in the large intestine
of a Great White.

247
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,120
Oh, is that what this is?

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,440
Are you in mourning?
You wanted her dead.

249
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,480
Wanted to kill her myself!

250
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,320
Not to say, "I told you so," to a...

251
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,320
Belligerent psychopath.

252
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,920
You could have shot her months ago
when she was out of the suit.

253
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,120
When did I say
I was going to shoot her?

254
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,240
I said I wanted her dead.

255
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
You...

256
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,920
"Cousin Bruce".
Procured the kryptonite.

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,240
I was going to ensure commander
Kane found it.

258
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,920
A scene would bring them together.

259
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,800
Batty would get caught
in his crosshairs.

260
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,280
Then, bang!

261
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,320
As she went down,
he would pull off her cowl,

262
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,520
to discover in sinking horror
that he had killed his own daughter.

263
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
Alas...

264
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,400
Mechanical failure.

265
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,320
Hey, Bruce. There's no steam
coming out of the steam shower.

266
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,200
What the hell did you do that for?

267
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,280
No reason at all
because reason doesn't matter.

268
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,560
She's got a friend upstairs.

269
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,040
- You want her to call the cops?
- I tried being reasonable once.

270
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,040
I was tethered to reason.

271
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,080
I was calculated, precise, planned,

272
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,400
and look where that got me.

273
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,520
Sharing a roof with Bruce lame.

274
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,880
On what planet...

275
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,960
Do I agree to live with a woman

276
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,600
who just told me her plan
of have her father kill her twin

277
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,120
like it was some kind
of April fool's joke.

278
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,880
On my planet...

279
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,800
because on my planet,
you are still Tommy Elliot

280
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,440
and if I so much as breathe a word,

281
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,800
Bruce Wayne goes from being the meat
in a top model sandwich to the guy

282
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,320
with a steak for a face!

283
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,280
Trust me, Tom-Tom.

284
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,320
An Alice with a goal is so much
sweeter than an Alice unmoored.

285
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,840
Fancy seeing you here.

286
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,240
Figured I'd look around
to see if Kate

287
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,480
had been getting any death threats.

288
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,520
And what did we deduce
from that jumper?

289
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Is it dangerous?

290
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
What are you doing here?

291
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,680
Before she left, Kate said
that if anything ever happened to her

292
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,080
that I should check her safe.

293
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Okay.

294
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Where is it?

295
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,800
She also asked
that I not tell anyone.

296
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,560
- Pretty sure she didn't mean me.
- Why?

297
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,680
Some sort of unrequited
soul mate clause?

298
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,280
Because I think Kate
has been targeted for some reason,

299
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,080
and she knows I won't stop
until I find the truth.

300
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,400
GPS says it's this way.

301
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,240
Kate? Kate!

302
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,560
You're alive!

303
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
No.

304
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,120
Guess you're in on it, too.

305
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,560
I saw her plane go down,
put two and two together.

306
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
I'm really sorry.

307
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,560
Well, the suit has GPS,

308
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,960
so you might as well
just give it back now, miss...

309
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Wilder.

310
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,400
Ryan...

311
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,800
And I'm not done with it yet.

312
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,120
That suit is meant for a hero,
not the lost and found.

313
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,520
You tell that
to the bored billionaire

314
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,160
who found it in batman's lost box?

315
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,880
You don't know the first thing
about Kate Kane

316
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,080
and you sure as hell don't
know anything about that symbol.

317
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,320
Trust me, I know I'm not a symbol

318
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,280
or a name or a legacy.

319
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,720
Exactly, so why do you think
you're worthy of wearing it?

320
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,240
Because I'm a number.

321
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,240
I am the 327th baby of a black woman
who died during childbirth that year.

322
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,360
I'm a 20 dollar a day check
to a group home.

323
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,120
I'm inmate 4075, serving 18 months
for a crime I didn't commit,

324
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,280
but I can live with all those numbers
because the mama who adopted me,

325
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,960
I was her number one,

326
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,440
but it turns out she's just one
of a quarter million murders

327
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,040
in this country
who have not seen justice

328
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,840
and that is a number
I can't live with,

329
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,600
so you can have
this damn suit back

330
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,080
when her killer is dead.

331
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,480
Bruce Wayne.

332
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,560
I take it they're out
of cocaine in Belize.

333
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,840
Missed you, too, uncle Jake.

334
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,800
You know, believe it or not, I came
home to help find my favorite cousin.

335
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
You want to help?

336
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,760
You stay out of my way
and let me do my job.

337
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,920
That's why I'm here
to eliminate distractions.

338
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,120
I have a lead on Gotham's
most elusive terrorist.

339
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,560
- Batwoman? I scared her away.
- I'm referring to Alice.

340
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
How?

341
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,480
- You just got home.
- Exactly.

342
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,080
She's squatting in my house.

343
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,280
She must have figured
I was gone for good.

344
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Now, look.
Before you barge in there

345
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,240
and start mucking up all
my furniture,

346
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,920
I'd prefer not to end up
on her kill list.

347
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,360
You didn't hear this from me.

348
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Bruce?

349
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,440
Julia Pennyworth.

350
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,360
Luke told me you were back.

351
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,280
Yeah. I meant to call, but...

352
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,200
No.
We've all been so worried about you.

353
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,960
I'm here, I'm healthy

354
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,640
and I'm late for a meeting actually,
so...

355
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Did you ring the eagle?

356
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Eagle?

357
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
The eagle.

358
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,880
Daddy practically raised you.
I think he thinks you're dead.

359
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,200
Good point.

360
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,600
Yeah, I'll clear that up.

361
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,400
Well, he's at home in Glasgow,
same little cottage in the woods.

362
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,960
I'll buzz him asap.
Good seeing you, Jules.

363
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,840
Look, Mary, there's no point.

364
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,080
Okay. She figured out
how to turn off the GPS.

365
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,280
I know, but if I learn more
about this Ryan wilder chick,

366
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,840
maybe I can narrow down her circles
and figure out where she lives.

367
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,560
"The Kane family has turned
their 56th-floor riverside penthouse

368
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,520
into a search party headquarters."

369
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,240
That would be nice. 56 Floors up.

370
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,040
Talk about optimal sunlight.

371
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,480
Don't look at me like that.

372
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,600
Her mom died in childbirth,

373
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,440
father died before she was born.

374
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,360
"Following her father's footsteps,

375
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Kate attended point rock academy."

376
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,880
In and out of group homes,
teen runaway,

377
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,280
high-school dropout.

378
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,840
Oh, wait a minute. This is juicy.

379
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,280
"Kate was dishonorably discharged
weeks before graduation.

380
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,400
"In her statement, Kate said,

381
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,880
"it's paradoxical
to fight on behalf "

382
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,800
of an institution that sees...

383
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,800
My sexual orientation as the enemy.'"

384
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,920
Okay. That's kind of badass.

385
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,680
Arrested for possession and intent.

386
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,760
Insisted the drugs weren't hers...

387
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,680
And served months.

388
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,920
"Under pride real estate,

389
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
she donated millions"
To inner city housing projects.

390
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,480
"Most recently,
she opened the hold-up,

391
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,440
"A gay bar
that she called a safe haven

392
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,320
for anyone looking for their family."

393
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
At her sentencing,

394
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,520
the judge said that Ryan had
been on the right track thanks

395
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,160
to the woman who adopted her.

396
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,440
Ryan graduated high school,
she found a job.

397
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Everything fell apart after.

398
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,160
Oh, my god.

399
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,240
Apparently when Ryan
and her adoptive mom walked

400
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,640
into their new apartment,

401
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,800
they startled a bunch of squatters
and a fight broke out.

402
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,800
The building's into landlord
and Ryan's mom were killed.

403
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,040
What the hell is this?

404
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,640
Who are these people?

405
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,880
I don't know. They just showed up.

406
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,840
We need to get out of here now!

407
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,520
The squatters were linked
to the Alice in Wonderland gang.

408
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,720
That's why she wants the suit,

409
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,440
to go after Alice...

410
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,680
Because Alice's gang
killed her mom.

411
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,520
Three, four, five, six, seven!
Come on, mommy! Live!

412
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,840
Wake up! Please!

413
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,720
Wake up, please, mama.

414
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,000
Kate's a hero...

415
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,000
In the suit...

416
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,280
I'm sorry, mama.

417
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,920
And out of the suit.

418
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,920
They're right, mama.

419
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,960
What am I doing wearing
the suit of a hero

420
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,520
when I couldn't even save you?

421
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,480
I mean, I get it.

422
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,400
Her mom died in her arms.

423
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,640
She wants justice.

424
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Hey.

425
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,400
We're gonna find Kate.

426
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,040
She needed the suit to survive.

427
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,320
Miracles happen.

428
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,560
- I mean...
- It's my fault.

429
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,280
I was the one hell-bent
on destroying the kryptonite.

430
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,280
She didn't even want to do it
and I pushed.

431
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,440
Luke, that is not what happened.

432
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,920
I'm the reason she got on that plane.

433
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,520
Kate's dead...

434
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
Because of me.

435
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,160
Luke.

436
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,640
You didn't do anything wrong,

437
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,760
okay?

438
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Yeah.

439
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
Look at me.

440
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,200
What would Kate say if she knew
you were blaming yourself?

441
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,080
I don't know.
Things are usually her fault.

442
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,960
She'd tell you

443
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,280
that there'd be no Batwoman
without Luke fox

444
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,120
and to put your pain
into something worth changing.

445
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,960
Come get your suit back.

446
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,840
He didn't remember
our codename for my father.

447
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,560
The eagle? He made it up.

448
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,520
Yes. I told him to ring daddy at home
at his cottage in Glasgow.

449
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,720
Bruce didn't blink an eye.

450
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,480
Alfred lives in a flat in London.

451
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,920
I smelled alcohol on his breath.

452
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,480
I saw he had a drink
in the commander's office,

453
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
ran the glass for prints.

454
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,000
Please do not say
what I think you're about to say.

455
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,320
I'm really sorry, Luke.

456
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,160
I think Alice made him a new face.

457
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
No.

458
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,080
No. They carried Tommy Elliot out
of Arkham in a body bag.

459
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,120
Or they wanted us to believe as much

460
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,400
and who better to masquerade
as Bruce Wayne than the person

461
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,400
who's been obsessed
with him his entire life?

462
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,240
How did I not see this?

463
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,240
Bruce is my friend and Tommy...

464
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,440
Tommy Elliot killed my dad!

465
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,160
Luke, you wanted Kate back

466
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,600
and if the miracle arrival
of Bruce Wayne could help find her,

467
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,600
then why question it?

468
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,600
I showed him the Batcave.

469
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,960
Where is it, Brucey-boy?

470
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,920
I know it's here somewhere.

471
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,960
There she is.

472
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,720
- He's going after Ryan.
- Ryan?

473
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,520
- Why?
- For the suit

474
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,680
So he can be batman.

475
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,560
<i>I know something you don't know.</i>

476
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,800
You know where Kate is?

477
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,360
Alice, if you know where she is,
you tell me right now!

478
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,960
What do I know?

479
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,160
What do I know?

480
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,000
I know what a watermelon looks like
when it falls from a great height.

481
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,720
That's your sister
you're talking about.

482
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,120
And now she's gone,

483
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,360
which is probably your cue
to move on with your life,

484
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,040
maybe remarry,

485
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,160
find a new daughter
to replace her with.

486
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,520
I'm not making the same mistakes
I made with you.

487
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,520
I will not stop looking
until she's found.

488
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,000
It's over, Alice...

489
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,600
Kate Kane is Batwoman!

490
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,800
And I'm the joker.

491
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Arkham's waiting.

492
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,240
Use your brain, commander.

493
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,800
A lesbian superhero who could have
killed me a dozen times but didn't?

494
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,760
I wonder who that could be.

495
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,960
That's preposterous.

496
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,400
- Kate would have told me.
- You rejected her...

497
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,160
Over and over to the world,
to her face.

498
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,280
You wanted her dead.

499
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,680
- You're wrong.
- Am I...

500
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,960
or did you spend
your last precious moments together

501
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,520
firing a gun at her?

502
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,760
You got your wish, daddy.

503
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,960
Batwoman...

504
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,080
Is dead...

505
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,320
and she died knowing
that her father hated her.

506
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,960
If you don't believe me,
turn on the bat-signal,

507
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,320
see if she comes.

508
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,880
<i>Batcave to Ryan.</i>

509
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,720
Batcave to Ryan. Batcave to Ryan.
You've got someone coming for you.

510
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Hello.

511
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,480
I'm... I'm here.

512
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,080
Is Batman actually chasing me
right now?

513
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,200
It's not Batman.
It's Tommy Elliot.

514
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,480
He looks like Bruce Wayne,
but he's actually

515
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,920
a psychotic Arkham escapee
who will kill anyone in his path.

516
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,840
Yeah. You're not making
it any better.

517
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,240
<i>Jingle bells, batman smells
Robin laid an egg</i>

518
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Come on.

519
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,760
Are you kidding me?
What was that?

520
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,080
He wants the suit.

521
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,040
He can have it.
I'll toss it out the window!

522
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,240
- No!
- No! If he gets that suit,

523
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,880
he becomes the most dangerous person
in gotham.

524
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,320
- You need to outrun him.
- Outrun him?

525
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,960
Look at his car.
I don't even have hubcaps!

526
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,440
Here's a sentence
I've never said before.

527
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,200
Can you hack the Batmobile?

528
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,200
I'll try. Until 10 minutes ago,
I didn't even know it was in here.

529
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
I'm in.

530
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Come on!

531
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,720
- Well, that bought her some time.
- Yeah. Time maybe,

532
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,160
but she needs
to buy her own survival.

533
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,520
Hello?

534
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,600
I want my batsuit.

535
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,000
- Oh, crap.
- What?

536
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,920
- What?
- Tommy has the kryptonite.

537
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,760
You're not Bruce Wayne.

538
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,280
And you're not Batwoman.

539
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,960
<i>Batcave to Ryan. Hello?</i>

540
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,600
Ryan? Batcave to Ryan. Talk to me.

541
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
No!

542
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,240
<i>Batcave to Ryan.
Come in.</i>

543
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,920
<i>Batcave to Ryan.
Come in. Ryan.</i>

544
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,880
<i>- Batcave to Ryan. Come in.</i>
- We're good.

545
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,320
It's done. It's over.

546
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Sophie called.

547
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,840
Divers still haven't found
anything in the harbor.

548
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,360
Well, as long as my dad's in charge,
no one's giving up.

549
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,360
In the meantime, Tommy Elliot's
on his way back to arkham.

550
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,160
So, I know we're in no mood
to pop a bottle of bub,

551
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,520
but at least Ryan stopped Tommy
from getting the suit.

552
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,360
Hey. We're just lucky
we got the Batmobile back

553
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,080
- before the cops showed up.
- My point is...

554
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,720
We may have been a little judgy

555
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,840
when we first met her.

556
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,400
She did a good job filling in today.

557
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,240
- Kate is Batwoman, Mary.
- I know.

558
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,960
It's not bulletproof, FYI.

559
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,200
Is this from the kryptonite?

560
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
You mean this?

561
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,240
Yeah. Hurt like a bitch, too.

562
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,640
This was supposed to kill you.

563
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,840
Yeah. Well, it didn't.

564
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
Are you okay?
Can I see the wound?

565
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
I'm good.

566
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,120
Look. I'm sorry about Kate's suit.

567
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I hope you find her.

568
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
Wait.

569
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,600
What about everything that you said?
What... what about your mom?

570
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
That suit,

571
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,760
it's bigger than me.

572
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,440
It's one thing to put it on
and it's another thing to wear it.

573
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,240
Like you said, Kate was a hero.

574
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
I'm not.

575
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,160
Are you still in love with Kate?

576
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,000
Where did that come from?

577
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,600
Because I know how you used to feel,

578
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,000
that if you could do
it all over again you

579
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,160
would have jumped on her bike
and left point rock in your dust.

580
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,680
How do you even know that?

581
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
The question is...

582
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,440
Did you still feel
that way two days ago?

583
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I don't know.

584
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,800
This is what Kate left in her safe.

585
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,880
I didn't read it,

586
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,800
but I have a feeling
I know what it says.

587
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,200
<i>Hey, Sophie,</i>

588
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,080
<i>If you're reading this,</i>

589
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,920
<i>It means I'm not here to tell you
this in person.</i>

590
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,080
<i>I'm Batwoman.</i>

591
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,120
<i>Though part of me thinks
you always knew.</i>

592
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,120
<i>Even when I did a damn good job
of convincing you otherwise,</i>

593
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,560
<i>I'm telling you this because I know,
you'll figure it out eventually,</i>

594
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,800
<i>and I want you to know
that lying to you</i>

595
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,800
<i>was the hardest thing
I've ever done</i>

596
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,000
<i>but I lied because I love you.</i>

597
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,080
<i>Because I wanted to protect you</i>

598
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,000
<i>and because I was scared
that you would push me away.</i>

599
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,360
<i>So that's the truth.</i>

600
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,040
<i>I hope you think
I did a good job for our city</i>

601
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,240
<i>and I hope
you'll always remember me.</i>

602
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,200
Good news, my dear Mouse.

603
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,080
I have purpose once again.

604
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,240
It was Safiyah
who ruined everything

605
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,800
and now I'm going to ruin her.

606
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
It's lucky you're dead already,

607
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,680
my dear brother,

608
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,880
because there's a
war coming to Gotham

609
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,600
and now there's
no Batwoman to stop it.

610
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,560
I did the right thing today, mama.

611
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,680
And I will try to do the right thing
tomorrow and the next day

612
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,160
and sooner or later, I promise,

613
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,160
I'll be your number one girl again.

614
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,480
What the hell was that?
