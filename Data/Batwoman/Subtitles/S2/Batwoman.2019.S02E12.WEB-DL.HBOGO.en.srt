1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,720
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,840
Quite frankly,
the makeover this city needs

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,040
comes from an ugly
I've never seen before.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,800
I love you so m...

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,120
Oh, no!

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,840
We are going to get Ang back, okay?

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,360
I killed Ocean

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,760
and I felt...

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
nothing.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
I'm alive

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,000
and very pissed off.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,800
Angelique, where is she?

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,560
Wave hello
to your fans, Angelique.

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,240
I need you to watch
as these two let me go.

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>You teaming up with Sophie like
this? It's a bad idea.</i>

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,080
<i>Okay? She's gonna figure
out who you are. She's smart.</i>

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,440
<i>Ryan, on I'm really
missing my batsuit right now.</i>

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
Oh, my God.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,560
Masks have taken on...

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,040
various meanings over time.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Deceit...

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
disguise...

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,880
cheap entertainment.

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,560
But as Jung once said...

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,560
we all wear masks...

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,800
both to...

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,440
create an impression upon others...

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
but also to hide
our own true natures.

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,120
Good evening, Mr. Sionis.

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
It's absolutely beautiful.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,920
Though making people look
their best is my specialty

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,720
I think this just so happens
to be my masterpiece.

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,120
For generations, every Sionis...

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,800
Has had a replica mask

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,160
decorating their casket.

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,160
I exhumed this one

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,480
from the coffin of my dearly
departed daughter.

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
Once dead...

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,240
now, on the verge of rebirth.

40
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,920
My name

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,440
is Kate Kane.

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,040
No. No.

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,400
Dr. Rhyme, if you would.

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Ms. Kane...

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,360
our therapy has come
to an end-point.

46
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,680
On my cue...

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,200
you will remember nothing
of your life before today.

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,960
Your only memories
will be those of

49
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,240
Circe...

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,560
Sionis.

51
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
No.

52
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
No...

53
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
No!

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,240
I must warn you, Roman.

55
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,120
While psychologically
and behaviorally

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,680
she is your daughter...

57
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,080
There was nothing I could
do about her voice.

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,000
Her larynx was damaged
by your man

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,600
during the kidnapping
and subsequent torture.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,640
What the hell, Dad?
why am I wearing this mask?

61
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,280
Now, don't you remember, sweetheart?

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,880
You were in a terrible fire
when you broke out of Arkham.

63
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,600
It still feels a little fuzzy.

64
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,880
Well, things will become
more and more clear

65
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,240
as the days pass.

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,600
The important thing is,
now that you have this mask...

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,760
no one will ever hurt you again.

68
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,200
You're a little late
for turndown service.

69
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Where is he?

70
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,840
Agent Tavaroff.

71
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,600
Heard a rumor you got
a DNA sample from the bat?

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,920
I'll verify your rumor
if you verify mine.

73
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,360
Word is you were pretty tight
with the last one.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
{\an5}What's your point, Russell?

75
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,160
{\an5}Oh, that you could save
the lab a lot of trouble

76
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,560
{\an5}if you could give us
the name of this one.

77
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,280
{\an5}How many rape kits have
to go to the back of the line

78
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,520
{\an5}so you can make a big splash
to boost your career?

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,680
{\an5}The commander know about you
squandering resources like this?

80
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,000
{\an5}He's the one
who signed off on it, actually.

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Commander?

82
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,520
Moore, what can I do for you?

83
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,800
I know how you feel
about vigilantes, sir.

84
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,280
{\an5}But instead of wasting
our time with Batwoman

85
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,760
{\an5}shouldn't we be trying
to figure out who Black Mask is?

86
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Well, we were...

87
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,680
{\an5}but Batwoman got in the way of that

88
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,600
{\an5}ruined our undercover operation

89
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,240
and cost us a chance
to take down Black Mask.

90
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,080
She's on our side, Commander.

91
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,080
{\an5}Well, if that were true, she wouldn't
mind being on a first-name basis.

92
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,480
{\an5}Is that the real reason
you're doing this?

93
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Trust?

94
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,440
{\an5}Or is it because every time
you see her, you think of Kate?

95
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,920
{\an5}Get out of my office, Moore.

96
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,320
{\an5}- Excuse me?
- You think a little fling

97
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,840
{\an5}with my daughter five years ago

98
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,520
{\an5}gives you permission
to tell me how to do my job?

99
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Sir, I...

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I didn't mean to overstep.

101
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,440
Get out of my office now.

102
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Yes, sir.

103
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
Why are you making me relive this?

104
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,560
Black Mask kept tabs on his
cookhouses with a video feed...

105
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
allowed him an eye on the cookie jar

106
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,960
without actually getting
his hand caught in it.

107
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,440
Smart, right? Wrong.

108
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Because that allows me to
track the Internet traffic...

109
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,320
So we can track it back to the
camera's IP address

110
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,600
{\an5}to get the location of the cookhouse

111
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,880
{\an5}where Angelique is being held.

112
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,800
{\an5}Not just a pretty face here, people.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Send those cookhouse coordinates
to the Batmobile.

114
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,960
I'm not sure that's
gonna be your first stop.

115
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,240
Somebody turned on the batsignal.

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Hi.

117
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
It's not a pager.

118
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
A little busy here.

119
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,600
{\an5}Well, unless you want to
give me your name and number...

120
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
What do you want?

121
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
First off...

122
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,400
lose the 'tude?

123
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,080
I'm doing you a favor.

124
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
I thought you should know
the Crows are in the process

125
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,040
of extracting your DNA profile

126
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,320
from blood spatter found
at the Snakebite facility.

127
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,080
{\an5}Once they have that,
they're gonna upload it

128
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,720
to the National DNA Registry.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
{\an5}Of course...

130
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,000
{\an5}they'll need something
to match it against

131
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,400
so you should be good.

132
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,040
Unless, of course,
you've ever been in the system.

133
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,760
{\an5}Anything you want to tell me?

134
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,160
Other than you need
to destroy that sample?

135
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
{\an5}It's already being processed.

136
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,720
{\an5}They'll have the profile in a few hours.

137
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,520
{\an5}Arrest warrant won't be
long after that.

138
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,200
{\an5}I better use what time I have left

139
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,440
to save the one person
who had the guts to testify

140
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,560
against Black Mask.

141
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
Remember her?

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
The one the Crows were
supposed to protect?

143
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
Wait.

144
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,400
{\an5}I can't make any promises about the
sample, but I'll do my best.

145
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,280
Let's hope that's enough.

146
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
<i>Am I close?
We don't have a lot of time.</i>

147
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,240
Batwoman, we took a group vote
and you need to come home.

148
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,760
What are you talking about?

149
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Angelique is being held
somewhere in this dump.

150
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,240
And while we appreciate that
she's a former flame...

151
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,840
Sophie just dropped an A-bomb.

152
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,760
We need to figure out how
to preserve your identity.

153
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,920
We will once I find Angelique.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,600
Didn't Sophie just say that we only
had a couple more hours?

155
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,760
<i>Yeah. So I got to be quick.</i>

156
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,120
Okay. I'm just gonna say it.

157
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,720
Finding Angelique is not
worth throwing

158
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,160
The Bat legacy down the drain.

159
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Excuse me?

160
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
Look. I'm just saying
you can't have both.

161
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,200
Black Mask is using Angelique
to cook Snakebite

162
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,600
right? So he went through
a lot of trouble for her.

163
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,600
So, I highly doubt he'd just kill off
his golden goose right off-the-bat.

164
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,440
Priority number one
should be saving the future

165
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,840
of the symbol for your sake
and the city's and then...

166
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
<i>How about this?</i>

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,040
You two call Sophie, you all put your
heads together and save my future.

168
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,120
I'll be here kicking
some False Face ass,

169
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
saving my past.

170
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
I'll check in later.

171
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,160
Oh! Stop!

172
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,720
What the hell is this?

173
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,000
Barbeque for one?

174
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
Batty!

175
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
What brings you here?

176
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,120
Was it the odor?

177
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,720
Honestly, I've been at this so long

178
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,120
I can hardly smell it.

179
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240
Why are you here?

180
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,040
The False Face kidnapped a friend...

181
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,640
so I've been popping
by their known hideouts,

182
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,840
seeing if someone would be willing

183
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,440
to spill his possible location.

184
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,640
I'm looking for someone
they kidnapped, too.

185
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,240
Really?

186
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,920
Her name wouldn't happen
to be...

187
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I don't know...

188
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,920
Angelique, by chance?

189
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,200
How do you know that?

190
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Well...

191
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,680
according to Mr. Extra-Crispy
over here...

192
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,840
when Angelique couldn't
conjure up the special sauce

193
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,800
that gives Snakebite its...
bite...

194
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,000
Black Mask took her phone and used it

195
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,200
to track down the actual chef

196
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,440
who does know all
11 herbs and spices.

197
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,880
You're talking about Ocean.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I thought you killed him?

199
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,200
Well, that's completely
besides the point.

200
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Which is?

201
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,000
Angelique and Ocean are
apparently being held at a place

202
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,400
that is more fortified than this one

203
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,160
and quite frankly, I need backup...

204
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,280
by which, I mean
someone to stand behind

205
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,240
so that the bullets
don't hit my visage.

206
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Damn.

207
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,640
You're crazier than
everyone already thinks.

208
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,120
Well, enemy of my enemy,
doesn't that mean...

209
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,520
That you're still the bitch
who murdered my mom.

210
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,560
Touché...

211
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,880
but I'm also the bitch

212
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,760
who knows where our
beloved cooks are.

213
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,480
The only one who knows,
as of now.

214
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,240
And as much as our...

215
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,960
dearly departed was forthcoming
about their location...

216
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,000
he wasn't as clear about
how long they'd stay alive.

217
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,560
Apparently, Black Mask
just wants them

218
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,880
to spill the recipe, so the clock
is tick, tick, ticking.

219
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
What do you say?

220
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Partners?

221
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,200
That silence sounds like
a firm "yes".

222
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,200
You cross me...

223
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,440
and you don't have to worry
about bullets killing you.

224
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Okay.

225
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,760
Oh, goody! I've always wanted
to ride in the Batmobile!

226
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,160
What does this button do?

227
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,160
Pisses me off. Don't make
me hit the ejector seat.

228
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
That exists?

229
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
You want to find out?

230
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Kind of.

231
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,400
Initiate self-destruct?

232
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Cool.

233
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Hey!

234
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,120
This is a rescue mission,
not a school field trip.

235
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,880
- Stop!
- You agreed to this

236
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,600
little team-up pretty quickly,
which tells me that this Angelique

237
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,920
must be very near
and dear to your heart.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,440
You want to tell me
where I should turn?

239
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,720
Keep going straight...

240
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,640
which I'm guessing you
didn't do with Angelique.

241
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,280
Come on. You can tell me everything.
Who emojied who first?

242
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm dying to know how a drug chef
stole Batwoman's heart.

243
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,600
We are not doing this.

244
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,600
We are not getting
to know each other.

245
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,560
Everything I need to know about you
is written on my mama's grave.

246
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Okay.

247
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Can I help you?

248
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,320
Commander Kane just wanted
an update on the Batwoman sample.

249
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Yeah?

250
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,960
He's not the only one.

251
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,320
Agent Tavaroff was
just here checking on it.

252
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't worry. I'm gonna babysit
this thing the whole way.

253
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,480
How long until it's ready?

254
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Not much longer.

255
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,240
You know we're gonna have to

256
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,800
deep clean the batmobile now.

257
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,120
Oh, I am well aware.

258
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,880
Based on the trajectory,
they're headed

259
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
somewhere along the waterfront.

260
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,160
I get the appeal of Angelique

261
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,360
or whatever, but how
desperate are we?

262
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
I mean, Alice?

263
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,440
Alice? Really?

264
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,240
Do we even know this isn't a trap?

265
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,360
Nope.

266
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,600
Tell me you destroyed it.

267
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,400
I can't. Too many eyes.
we need a plan B.

268
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,320
What? Sophie? No.
Every plan involves you

269
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,600
destroying the damn sample!

270
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,040
Look. My entire office is acting like

271
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,600
they're sitting on the nuclear codes.

272
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,600
I'd have an easier time
swiping records out of Area 51.

273
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,640
There are only 78 more minutes
till they get her profile.

274
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,320
Then, they're gonna upload it
to the National DNA database and...

275
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,640
And if she's ever been entered in
there for any reason ever...

276
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,280
<i>such as an arrest...</i>

277
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
they're gonna get a match

278
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,960
and the whole world will
know Batwoman's identity.

279
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,560
<i>I got to go. Bye.</i>

280
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,720
How do you know False Face
was telling you the truth?

281
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Well, it's hard to lie
through your teeth

282
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,960
when they've all been yanked out.

283
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,400
Everybody ready for their closeup?

284
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,680
"An idiot's guide to
making Snakebite"...

285
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
take one.

286
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
And...

287
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Action.

288
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Take two.

289
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,120
There will not be a take three.

290
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
One sentry.

291
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,640
Looks like they're trying
to keep a low profile.

292
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
I want to see.

293
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,960
Why don't I get any bat toys?

294
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,520
Can I least have a batarang?

295
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,280
Okay. You draw him out...

296
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,800
I'll take him out.

297
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,280
Think you can handle that?

298
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,440
Sure.

299
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,800
What the hell are you doing?

300
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,840
- What you asked.
- I told you to draw him out...

301
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,080
not draw him to us.

302
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,400
And I delivered.

303
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,640
Your move, lover girl.

304
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,520
See? That worked out splendidly.

305
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,960
Might want to
give me that batarang now.

306
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,960
Hey.

307
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,840
Got you a prezzie.

308
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,480
Mary, kind of busy right now.

309
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,320
- I can't really do...
- It's not from me.

310
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,600
It's from someone who knows
how hard you are to shop for

311
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,840
and he...

312
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
got you this.

313
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
It's a targeted kill drive.

314
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,280
Your lab is turning
Batwoman's DNA evidence

315
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,400
Into a bunch of ones and zeroes

316
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,920
and that guy will rearrange
those ones and zeroes...

317
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,120
making it unreadable.

318
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,440
Didn't know you were
on Batwoman's payroll, as well.

319
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,040
No. Luke just asked me as a favor...

320
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,400
because we hang out
casually as friends.

321
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
Yeah.

322
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,360
So according to the Bat team...

323
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,840
if I use this device,
then when the file

324
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,560
is transmitted to the DNA registry,
it won't match anything?

325
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,360
- Yeah.
- That's pretty clever.

326
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,360
So, did Luke include
an instruction manual?

327
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,720
No, but he is available
for tech support.

328
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,120
You just have to plug
that little cutie

329
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,880
into any computer in the building
with tier one access.

330
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,120
Tier one access?

331
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,360
There's only one person with that.

332
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,840
Your dad's been holed up
in there for hours.

333
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,840
How the hell do you expect me
to get him to leave?

334
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,080
Why do you think I'm here?

335
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,080
We make a shockingly good team
and by we, I mean your car and I.

336
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,800
Where are the cooks
being held on the boat?

337
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,000
Because I'm gonna tell you?

338
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,200
Your bad.

339
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,480
She was the nice one.

340
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,160
Where are the cooks?

341
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,720
Upper deck. Upper deck.

342
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,000
If they were harmed in any way,

343
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,760
I swear to you on my
headless mother's grave...

344
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,200
He just passed out.

345
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
Oh, my God.

346
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You love him.

347
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,960
I just kicked him for no reason.

348
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,320
- Not him. Ocean.
- Ocean? What?

349
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,120
No.

350
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,480
Is that your boyfriend?

351
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,440
I drove a knife through his heart.

352
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,880
Well, for you, that's not a no.

353
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,560
Oh. That's true.

354
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,080
I had a bit of a breakthrough
at yesterday's therapy session.

355
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,440
Although, it would appear
all the unresolved feelings

356
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,680
I have for him that

357
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,600
I thought I resolved
In killing him are...

358
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
as of yet, unfortunately
still on the table.

359
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
Last night's...

360
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,680
steamy tryst made it all
the more confusing.

361
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,680
That's why you needed my help.

362
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,320
To make sure he makes
it out of this alive.

363
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,880
Follow me. Stay close.

364
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,000
<i>Almost through with the cook, sir.</i>

365
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,240
I have to admit,
I'm quite pleased

366
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,520
with the performances.

367
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,120
Nuance is everything these days.

368
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Slow down.

369
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,440
Buy ourselves as much time
as possible.

370
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,720
<i>Got a perimeter breach</i>

371
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,080
<i>- at the North docks.
- What is it?</i>

372
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,400
Apparently, we got company.

373
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,760
<i>Looks like Batwoman.</i>

374
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
What?

375
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,800
And she's with that bitch, Alice.

376
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,480
We need backup
at the north dock now.

377
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,160
How will we pass the time?

378
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,680
Quietly would be my first choice.

379
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
I like you.

380
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
You're fun...

381
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
but mean.

382
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,440
You sure this Angelique chick is
good enough for you?

383
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
She is. Thank you for your concern.

384
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
Is she, though? I mean...

385
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,680
city hero, drug dealer.

386
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,440
Doesn't exactly scream Royal wedding.

387
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,760
You asking for a friend...

388
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
or...

389
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,400
are you asking
because you accidentally

390
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,800
have feelings for someone
and it terrifies you?

391
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Because...

392
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,640
how could anyone ever

393
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,600
love a monster who watched
her gang kill a woman

394
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,320
and not even wonder her name?

395
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,840
Obviously, asking for a friend.

396
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,840
Angelique was the only
person in our group home

397
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,200
who ever had my back.

398
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
I see.

399
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,520
So you were plucked away like

400
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,840
the little orphan Annie
while she was left behind.

401
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,800
That's why you're so determined
to save her now, isn't it?

402
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Guilt.

403
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,560
Where have I heard that before?

404
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,840
Your predecessor was obsessed
with saving me.

405
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,720
She couldn't accept
reality and move on.

406
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,360
Poor thing didn't
realize until it was too late...

407
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,560
And then she died.

408
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,520
Just a little piece of advice...

409
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,680
from an antihero to a hero.

410
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,320
You can't save everyone...

411
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,760
not without losing who you are.

412
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,760
Go! Let's go!

413
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,680
They're at the North docks.

414
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,920
If you really want to know who I am,

415
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,320
you should know this about me.

416
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,840
I am someone who never forgets.

417
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
What are you doing?

418
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,720
Oh, don't worry.

419
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,400
I'm gonna save Ocean...

420
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
from you.

421
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,520
I am going to make sure
he knows exactly what you are.

422
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,280
And...

423
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
Cut.

424
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
That's a wrap.

425
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,800
Batwoman to batcave.

426
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,440
I'm in, but...

427
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,160
kind of got
a maze situation going here.

428
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,880
Head to the left.

429
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,440
There should be a stairwell in
the Northeast corner.

430
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Copy.

431
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,440
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey. So the lab's

432
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,640
about to upload Batwoman's
DNA to the mainframe.

433
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,800
Talk me through this.

434
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,080
As soon as the file's uploaded...

435
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,520
click on Batwoman's profile.

436
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,200
It'll shred that baby
to high- tech ribbons.

437
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,520
- That's it?
- <i>That's it.</i>

438
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,320
Let's hope this was worth the wait.

439
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,000
And...

440
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,520
They're starting the upload now.

441
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,600
Okay. Here it comes.

442
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,080
- Oh, no.
- What? What happened?

443
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,200
It's not just Batwoman's file.

444
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,320
They're uploading
DNA profiles from dozens

445
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,840
of Crows investigations.

446
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
You can't single hers out?

447
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,760
That's the problem.
They made the file labels

448
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,200
numbers for anonymity.

449
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,760
There are no names.

450
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,720
Meaning, there's no way
to tell them apart.

451
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,200
The only way to get Batwoman's
would be to corrupt them all.

452
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,760
How serious are these cases?

453
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,960
This being Gotham, we can be
damn sure it's not for jaywalking.

454
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,920
If we did this...

455
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,840
we wouldn't just be
protecting Batwoman.

456
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,840
We would be protecting
rapists and murderers.

457
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
We can't do it, Luke.

458
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,920
What about Batwoman, Sophie?

459
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,960
The results will be back
in a matter of minutes.

460
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
<i>What are we supposed to do?</i>

461
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
I might have an idea.

462
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
What is this?

463
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,080
Guess who passed
the health inspection with

464
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,280
flying colors.

465
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,280
Last time we spoke,
I got the distinct impression

466
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,640
you had no interest In
legitimizing this place.

467
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,800
I didn't, but I do care
about staying open

468
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,640
and you keeping your guys
out of my hair

469
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,320
so consider this...

470
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
a compromise.

471
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
I'm impressed.

472
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,320
We've got up-to-code storage

473
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,800
certified nurses and doctors.

474
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,640
Sad to say, that leaves me inside
most days doing paperwork.

475
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,080
You okay?

476
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,960
You're sweating. Here.

477
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,200
Yeah. No. I'm...

478
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
I'm fine.

479
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,120
So, what happens if someone
walks in with a gunshot wound

480
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,280
that you're supposed
to report to GCPD?

481
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Well...

482
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,240
I do what the regulations say.

483
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,360
I fill out this

484
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,400
thingy and I fax it to the GCPD using

485
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,560
this ridiculous monstrosity...

486
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,840
which, I'm pretty sure,
is twice as old as I am.

487
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,000
This an oversight?

488
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Well...

489
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,280
no one ever taught me how
to send a telegraph

490
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
or a fax or whatever they are

491
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,360
and there's n... nothing

492
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,000
in the regulations that
requires me to hire an I.T. guy.

493
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,600
So you figured out your workaround.

494
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,720
Compromise works both ways.

495
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,080
Well, then as far as I'm concerned,
you're clear to open shop.

496
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,680
- I need to get going.
- Wh...

497
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,480
Wait, wait, wait. Seriously...

498
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,560
you do get that we're basically

499
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,800
treating and harboring
potential criminals here.

500
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,200
Well, if it means you'll
start taking my calls again,

501
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,960
I don't need to know
that that thing is not plugged in.

502
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,000
I'll... I'll talk to you later.

503
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Well, that worked.

504
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,800
Where's Batwoman?

505
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,400
Finally, a member of this lame
society who's actually trying.

506
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,440
Love this.

507
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,600
You can find her on the deck.

508
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,560
I'll be back for you.

509
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,560
Looking forward to it.

510
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Okay.

511
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,320
A few more minutes and the world
will know the name behind the Bat.

512
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,040
Dibs on arresting her ass,
by the way.

513
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,640
Come on, come on.

514
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,680
Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

515
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,560
Come on, come on, come on.

516
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,000
All righty. Who's ready for this?

517
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,480
Betting windows are closed.

518
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,080
The identity of Batwoman 2.0
is...

519
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
None found?

520
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,160
What... This is B.S.

521
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,280
How could she not be
in the system?

522
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,280
Did someone send out
Invites to a party

523
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,560
before they found out
If there was a party?

524
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
What are you looking at?

525
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Back to work.

526
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,800
<i>Tell Batwoman she's good.</i>

527
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,600
What did you do?

528
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,600
It's handled.
That's all that matters.

529
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,440
Now, I got to delete
my digital footprint

530
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,160
so the commander never
finds out about this.

531
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,080
Look, dude.
You don't have to kill us.

532
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,920
We can make as many
batches as you want.

533
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,080
She's right, man.
Watching a how-to video

534
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,200
isn't the real thing.
There's a million variables.

535
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,400
Potency of the fear toxin,
mushroom oil...

536
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,080
What the hell, man?

537
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Stop.

538
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,640
Wait. You don't want to do that.

539
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,800
What? This?

540
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,280
How did you find us?

541
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,960
Your girl Ryan sends her love.

542
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,440
- Can you walk?
- Go without me.

543
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,320
Dude, no. You're coming with us.
Come on, come on!

544
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,040
Hey. You're gonna get out of here.

545
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,320
You're gonna find that girl you
won't shut up about, okay?

546
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Yeah.

547
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Go find your girl.

548
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,280
You guys take the back...

549
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,720
keep your eyes up. There's
False Face everywhere.

550
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Hey.

551
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,960
- Thank you.
- Come on.

552
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,640
They're not leaving here.

553
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Yes, they are...

554
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,200
unless you can get through me.

555
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,640
- Thank you.
- Never

556
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,000
leave a woman
who's been in captivity

557
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,480
half her life alone
with a hairpin.

558
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
Help me!

559
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Good luck with that.

560
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,440
I remember your mom.

561
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,280
Cora. I remember her.

562
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,600
Short hair, purple sweater.

563
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,000
I lied about forgetting her.

564
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,960
Now, help me...

565
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
please.

566
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
Like you said...

567
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
can't save everyone.

568
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
What?

569
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,680
Oh, my God.

570
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,720
Hey! Check it!

571
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,440
It's amazing what a little paint

572
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,320
and six figures worth of permits and
doctor's salaries will do, right?

573
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,080
Yeah. It's...

574
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
nice.

575
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,520
Hey. Have you noticed anything
strange about your dad lately?

576
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
What do you mean?

577
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,600
I mean his demeanor.

578
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,280
Any mood swings, health issues?

579
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,920
He seemed fine when I saw him today.

580
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,760
I mean, he signed off on the place.

581
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,440
He even saw the fax machine.

582
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,400
- What fax machine?
- The one that's...

583
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,320
not plugged in that
keeps us from having to

584
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
report our patients
to the authorities.

585
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,360
He signed off on that?

586
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Your dad?

587
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
Yeah.

588
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,720
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

589
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,440
I found this in his office.

590
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,680
He probably seized it on a bust.

591
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,120
Wouldn't it be in evidence, then?

592
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
What are you saying?

593
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
It's his?

594
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,840
Your dad blew up at me
today out of nowhere.

595
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,200
He kicked me out of his office.

596
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,720
Then I found this a few hours later.

597
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,800
It sort of just sounds like my dad.

598
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,760
Soph, you can't be serious.

599
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,160
You should talk to him, Mary.

600
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
My dad is not

601
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,040
doing Snakebite.

602
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,200
Then it should be a short
conversation.

603
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,560
But I really think
you need to have it.

604
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,680
I thought you'd never
want to see me again.

605
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,000
Ryan, don't.

606
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Don't what?

607
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,960
Apologize.

608
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,040
I told you...

609
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,680
that you'd be protected
If you ratted out Black Mask.

610
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,960
You almost died because of me.

611
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,920
No. I almost died because
that's what I signed up for.

612
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,360
To make a lot of money...

613
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,840
to feel like I matter

614
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,640
and to know that everything

615
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,320
could be ripped away at any
moment, including my life

616
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,120
and all the people I care about.

617
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,200
It's my fault.

618
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,640
Then let's start over...

619
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,360
putting all of this behind us.

620
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,600
Come into witness
protection with me.

621
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,800
- What?
- I made a deal with the feds.

622
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,120
Everything I know about False Face
In return for my protection.

623
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,280
It's real.

624
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
I trust them.

625
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,760
Where are you gonna go?

626
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,560
Come with me and find out.

627
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,160
There's nothing holding us back now.

628
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,600
Say something.

629
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,760
My life is here.

630
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Here?

631
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,880
Gotham sucks.

632
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,200
It swallowed us whole
and spit us out, Ry.

633
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,960
But, what if it could suck less?

634
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,760
How? This city's a cesspool.
Look out the freaking window.

635
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,760
There are ways to fix it.

636
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,320
Like the community center
I'm working on.

637
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Ang...

638
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,920
what if kids like us didn't have to
grow up in the same city we did?

639
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,120
I never deserved you, did I?

640
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,600
Are you kidding me?

641
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,640
You changed my life.

642
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,880
I'm gonna miss you, Ry.

643
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Me, too.

644
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,080
Pretty swanky place you got here

645
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,600
for a guy who slings dope
in the streets.

646
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Alice...

647
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,840
delusional leader of the defunct and
failed Wonderland gang.

648
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,840
Charmed, I'm sure.

649
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
I'm not.

650
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,120
Why is she getting
fleas on my furniture?

651
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,240
She was with Batwoman
during tonight's siege.

652
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,480
Figured you'd appreciate
a face-to-face.

653
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Just kill her.

654
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,480
I didn't even do anything. I was
chained to a pipe most of the night.

655
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,800
Actually, there is one thing she has

656
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,200
that could be of interest.

657
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,600
Dump her in the cellar.
I'll deal with her tomorrow.
