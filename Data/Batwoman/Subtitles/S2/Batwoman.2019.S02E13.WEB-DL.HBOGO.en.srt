1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,920
Do you know
why it's called beginner's luck?

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,000
I'll give you a clue.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,240
It's because it's unexpected
and because it doesn't last.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,440
As far as I'm concerned,
it'll last for 13 life sentences.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,720
I love puzzles

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,280
but yours, rookie Crow,
is missing a few pieces.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,000
How did you solve
clue master's riddle?

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,680
I know it's just my first day,
but a little advice...

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,360
Don't advertise the crime
you're about to commit

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,720
if you don't want to get caught.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,640
But that's how I showcase
the sheer stupidity of mankind.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,760
I provide the authorities
with all the clues

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,440
and then watch
as they screw it all up, anyway.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,480
I'm sorry your view of mankind
is so bleak.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,120
Get well.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,040
No one has ever matched wits
with the master.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,320
Tell me how you did it.

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,320
Moore, please. I must know.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,040
You have the rest of your life
in here to figure it out.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,440
Sun's up, fun's up, Brown. Get up.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
Brown.

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,280
What then?

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,840
So, not to backseat hero,
but maybe leave one conscious

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,560
- To plant the tracker.
- Takes all the fun out of it.

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Where's Black Mask?

26
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Let me guess.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
You're more scared of him
than you are of me.

28
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,640
You have a code.
He doesn't. Do the math.

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,280
I love math. Here's some.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
There are three bones in your ankle.

31
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,560
If I break two, how many are lef...

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,640
Freeze.

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,520
Hands in the air.
You got to be kidding me.

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,480
He's ours. Back the hell away.

35
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,200
Kind of in the middle of something.

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,480
Kind of gonna shoot you in the face.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Hands in the air.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,760
- Now.
- You hearing this?

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,440
I know it's tempting, but don't.

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,480
- You want to know why you guys suck?
- And here we go.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,800
It's not just
because you don't care

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,960
about 99% of the people
in this city

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,400
or just because you lie
and you cheat

44
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,880
and you cover up murders.

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,560
It's because you legit
suck at your job.

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
Five seconds until we shoot.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,680
I put a tracker on his boot, moron.

48
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Guy had no idea.

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,920
He would have led me back
to Black Mask

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,240
I would have had the upper hand

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,760
and the most dangerous man in Gotham
would have been behind bars.

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,720
Instead,
your alpha asses show up late

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,720
acting like I was the enemy,
and they gave me time to do this.

54
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,280
{\an5}I've seen my fair share
of torture toys.

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,480
{\an5}If you know what I mean.

56
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,520
I think she knows what I mean,
but what the hell is that?

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,240
Oh, you don't need to worry
about this.

58
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,000
{\an5}I'd rather you use your energy
conjuring up a name.

59
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
Gladly.

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,840
When you crashed my Snakebite
cookout last night

61
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,080
you brought a friend.

62
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Batwoman.

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Friend?

64
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,400
{\an5}No. That conniving,
pointy-eared manipulator.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,720
{\an5}Led me down the garden path
of partnership and trust

66
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,880
{\an5}only to stab me in the back.

67
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
But you know what?

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,560
It's my fault. I should have known.

69
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,280
{\an5}You put on the suit, you're not happy
until Alice is behind bars

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,640
{\an5}- but you know what Really irks me...
- Shut up!

71
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,560
I'm the one doing
the torturing here, not you.

72
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,200
{\an5}Give me her name,
so I can destroy her life.

73
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,200
{\an5}The way she destroyed my business.

74
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
It eludes me.

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
You're lying.

76
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,960
{\an5}Black Mask enjoys people making
it difficult for themselves.

77
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,040
Well, then I'm your girl.

78
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,200
Now, if that doesn't pry something
out of you.

79
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,640
Well, we got nine more tries.

80
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,400
I'm ordering from
that bomb vegan wing place.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
{\an5}You want me
to order you something?

82
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,760
Ryan, hey.

83
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,080
Why is there a Crow in our loft?

84
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,720
I thought you were working late.

85
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,360
{\an5}I was, but then drama showed up

86
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,880
{\an5}and ruined my night,
so I cut out early.

87
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Why is Crowphie here?

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,480
{\an5}We were just hanging out.

89
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,320
{\an5}I didn't realize
I had to run guests by you.

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
You don't. It's just... her?

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
Okay, look.
I'm not here to add to your drama.

92
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,040
{\an5}The guys at work sent me tequila
for my five-year anniversary

93
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
{\an5}and I wanted to share it
with someone.

94
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,520
{\an5}You're welcome to join us.

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,760
{\an5}And honestly, based on the vibage
that you just walked in here with

96
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,240
{\an5}it kind of seems like you could use
some ultra-expensive tequila

97
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
right now.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,960
{\an5}So, am I supposed to just act like

99
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,240
{\an5}I'm cool with her being here?

100
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,760
{\an5}As a lesbian who was married
to a man for three years

101
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,640
{\an5}I will say drinking is
the key to denial.

102
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
I thought you were bi.

103
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,360
{\an5}Yeah. There's a lot we don't know
about each other yet, Ryan.

104
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
One drink.

105
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,880
Never have I ever had sex
on an airplane.

106
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,720
{\an5}Everyone, relax. It was private.

107
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,440
{\an5}Never have I ever sexted
the wrong person.

108
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,360
- Ryan, drink.
- Wait. What?

109
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,640
{\an5}Oh, oh, my bad.

110
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
My bad.

111
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,760
Yeah, your bad.

112
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,280
So, whatever you have going on
with Imani

113
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,680
{\an5}just FYI, consider me
an unwilling third.

114
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,080
- Oh! Who is Imani?
- I got one.

115
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,000
Never have I ever
compromised my values

116
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,000
to support a white
supremacist organization.

117
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,680
- Drink.
- Oh.

118
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,960
This is not working.

119
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,360
No, no, no, no. Hang on, hang on.

120
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,240
I got one. Okay.

121
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,360
Never have I ever kissed Batwoman.

122
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Yeah.

123
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
Never have I ever been saved
by Batwoman.

124
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,680
When did Batwoman save you?

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Last Halloween.

126
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, the O.G. makes more sense.

127
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,120
Why does it make more sense?

128
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,800
I don't know, Ryan,
why would it make absolutely no sense

129
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,840
for the new Batwoman
to have saved you?

130
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
It's okay.

131
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,360
Refills.

132
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,840
They say the worm is lucky.

133
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,880
No. No, no, no. This...

134
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,520
That ain't a worm.

135
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,320
This is why you don't drink hooch
from the Crows.

136
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,520
I think it's a puss caterpillar.

137
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,760
The southern flannel moth,
genus, <i>Megaloypyge.</i>

138
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,040
It's one of the most
venomous caterpillars

139
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,160
in the world.

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No.

141
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,720
Okay, but according to the Internet

142
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,280
a single caterpillar isn't lethal.

143
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
So, we're good, right?

144
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Wait. I don't think we're the target

145
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,280
and I don't think this bottle came
from your boys.

146
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
What?

147
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,160
A girl's been poisoned.

148
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,120
Not you. That's no fun.

149
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,640
Can you save her before midnight?

150
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,160
I'll give you a clue, hot shot,
probably not. Love...

151
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,640
Clue Master.

152
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,160
Okay. Who the hell is
Clue Master again?

153
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,440
Ever watch <i>Quiz Bowl</i>
back in the day?

154
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,920
Is that the <i>Jeopardy!</i> rip-off?

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,160
Not on purpose.

156
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
The host Arthur Brown got fired

157
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,200
and went on a murdering spree.

158
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,680
Along the way, he laid out clues
for law enforcement

159
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,520
to figure out
where his next kill would be.

160
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
It stumped everyone for weeks.

161
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,960
Called himself Clue Master.

162
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,160
Guys, Arthur Brown
escaped Black Gate today.

163
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,560
Oh, fine. I'll call my dad,
tell him we made contact.

164
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,440
No, you can't.

165
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
This is all a part
of clue master's game.

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,840
If we involve the authorities,
he's gonna see it as cheating.

167
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
He's toying with me.

168
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Getting his revenge.

169
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
- For what?
- He thinks

170
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,880
he's the most brilliant mind
in Gotham.

171
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,120
He believes I'm the only person
who's ever solved one of his puzzles,

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,560
and it's driving him crazy.

173
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,480
Okay. Well, it's time
to solve another one.

174
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,120
Yeah, "a girl's been poisoned.

175
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,640
Not you. That's no fun.

176
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,320
Can you save her before midnight?

177
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,040
I'll give you a clue, hot shot,
probably not.

178
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,800
Thanks. That's not a clue.

179
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,520
It's got to be, he's very specific
about the words he uses.

180
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,320
Has he ever called you "hot shot"
before?

181
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
Not that I know of. Why?

182
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,880
What are you doing?
I'm making hot shots.

183
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay. That's kind of sexy.

184
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
Anybody recognize this symbol?

185
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,280
I do. I know where to go.

186
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,400
Kane.

187
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,840
Hi, I know I'm probably
the last person you expected to call.

188
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Who is this?

189
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,240
<i>It's Alice. Beth.</i>

190
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,040
<i>Hello?</i>

191
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
I don't...

192
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,040
I... I don't understand.

193
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,240
I need you to trace this call,
and come rescue me.

194
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,600
<i>I'm being held by Black Mask,
and the fact</i>

195
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
<i>that I am S.O.S.ing</i>the man

196
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,960
who had several shoot-to-kill
orders on me

197
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,720
should underscore my desire to get
the hell out of here.

198
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Jacob Kane?

199
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Hello?

200
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,880
You have the wrong number.

201
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Daddy.

202
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Daddy?

203
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,440
So, wait.
Clue Master knew you'd recognize

204
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,680
some random-ass logo
in the middle of nowhere?

205
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
It's locked.

206
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,560
Give me a boost.

207
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,840
After I put him away,
he became obsessed with me.

208
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,560
Where I went to school,
where I trained

209
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,600
what kind of tequila I drink.

210
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,240
He couldn't figure out
how some rookie Crow

211
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,080
could solve a puzzle
that no one else could.

212
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. What?

213
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,560
I don't need a boost?

214
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
You'll be fine.

215
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
First fence?

216
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,080
It'll come as a shock to you,

217
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,960
but B&E doesn't come naturally.

218
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
Start looking for our vic,
keep your guard up.

219
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,920
What was this puzzle about?

220
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,720
<i>Quiz Bowl</i>was throwing a party
to honor the game show's top winners.

221
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,520
Arthur always thought
the writers dumbed down the questions

222
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,560
to appeal to a wider audience, so...

223
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,200
He put a riddle in the gazette

224
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,680
said he was gonna bomb the party.

225
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,000
So, how did you solve it?

226
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,520
The truth... I didn't.

227
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,080
All rookies spend a year
on the tip line

228
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,240
and on my very first day,
a girl called in frantic

229
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,280
told me about the puzzle,
then told me what it meant.

230
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,160
I was promoted to field agent
the very next day.

231
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,640
Because you lied and took credit
for something you didn't do.

232
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,760
You don't think it haunted me

233
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,560
Every time I strapped on a gun
my first year

234
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,680
that maybe I didn't deserve
to be there?

235
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,240
So, whose glory did you steal?

236
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,960
Someone who begged me
to keep her identity a secret

237
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,320
so I did.

238
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,320
This will come as a shock to you,

239
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,520
but I can be trusted.

240
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Guys.

241
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,160
"Just a nip should do the trick."

242
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
It's an antihistamine.

243
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,600
It'll counteract the poison.

244
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,480
Help! Help! Help me! Help!

245
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,760
What did he do to her?

246
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,400
Oh, my god. It's Stephanie Brown,

247
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,280
- Clue Master's daughter.
- Help! Help me!

248
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
- Agent Moore!
- Stephanie

249
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,200
- we're gonna get you out of there.
- How? There's no lock, no door.

250
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,280
What is this?

251
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,040
Did... did he poison me?

252
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,480
Are you kidding me?

253
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,960
Just relax, okay?

254
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,080
My dad poisoned me
and locked me in a box!

255
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,720
- You relax!
- Hang tight.

256
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,080
Well, thanks. Yeah.
Where else am I gonna go?

257
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,840
And your brilliant plan will be?

258
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,080
We're at a firing range.

259
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
We shoot it open.

260
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,480
With the girl inside?

261
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Would you guys shut up?

262
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,920
What are those?
I found these

263
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,680
under the railing chained
to that gun.

264
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,040
- It's one of his puzzles.
- Exactly.

265
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,920
So, if you two would just release
each other's throats for two seconds,

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,640
maybe we could actually figure
this thing out.

267
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,800
- Four targets.
- Yeah.

268
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,840
- Four bullets.
- That's how we get her out.

269
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,800
Look. We hit each of those targets
in this specific color order.

270
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,560
Too easy.
The blocks detach from the chain,

271
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,240
which means
they're probably not in order.

272
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,440
Besides, those symbols
have to mean something.

273
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,200
Okay. Alphabetical by animal then?

274
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,040
Okay. So, bird bobcat, fly,
and then spider.

275
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,800
Bobcat? That's a Puma,
which means it comes after fly.

276
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,120
It's a bobcat,
which means it comes before.

277
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,360
You want to bet her life on it?

278
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,920
Hey! There's a girl
dying in a box. Think.

279
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,280
If they're not in the right order,
why chain them together

280
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,800
- in the first place?
- Food chain.

281
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,400
They are in pecking order.

282
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,880
Okay, bobcat, Puma eats bird,

283
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,840
bird eats spider,
and spider eats fly.

284
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,640
- Let's find out.
- Who said you were shooting?

285
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,960
Pretty sure I just did.

286
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,840
Anyone want to discuss
the five shots of tequila

287
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,520
- you downed tonight?
- Mary.

288
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,760
- Yeah?
- Pick.

289
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,600
Someone who probably holds
a high score in duck hunt

290
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,040
or a military marksman?

291
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,600
Unless you have
some sharpshooter skills

292
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,840
you'd like to disclose.

293
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,080
- Go for it.
- Thank you. Now, back up.

294
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,840
Any questions?

295
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Nope.

296
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,480
Hey. Drink this, drink this.

297
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
It's gonna be okay.

298
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
No. It's not.

299
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
I don't think he's done.

300
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Word of advice.

301
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,480
The last person
who tried to one-up me

302
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,280
ended up
with his eyes gouged out

303
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,440
like two olives on a toothpick.

304
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,040
Now, that makes me want a martini.

305
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,360
Well, just tell Black Mask
who Batwoman is

306
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,800
and you'll be drinking one soon.

307
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,040
Here's the thing. I could

308
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,320
but then,
I wouldn't have the satisfaction

309
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,560
of killing her myself.

310
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
It's personal,
but I've had limited success

311
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,280
with my vengeance games as of late,
and quite frankly

312
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,680
it's left me feeling
rather unfulfilled.

313
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,160
Feelings. How awful.

314
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
I hope it's worth your life.

315
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,400
One eyeball at a time.

316
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,560
Funny story.

317
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,360
You remind me
of an inmate I heard of at Arkham.

318
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,320
Sweet Circe Sionis.

319
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,600
Poked the baby blues out
of some corporate bigwig.

320
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,640
My Mouse and I used to
call her "can't CEO killer."

321
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Memories.

322
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,080
He deserved it.

323
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Who, dear?

324
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
The corporate bigwig.

325
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,760
He crossed a line,
and I had to make sure

326
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,120
he never found his way back.

327
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,200
You. You gouged his eyeballs out.

328
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
Why, if it isn't Circe Sionis.

329
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,240
I heard that you were trampled
to death.

330
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,840
In the Arkham breakout.

331
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,120
On the contrary,
I was rescued by my father.

332
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,080
And did you get
those horrific burns before

333
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,360
or after daddy saved you?

334
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
Touchy subject?

335
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,080
Enough about me.

336
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,120
It's time to talk about Batwoman.

337
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,320
Bring me Black Mask.

338
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,840
I'll tell him exactly
what he wants to hear.

339
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,400
So, you woke up to discover

340
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,560
you were covered in
some coded message?

341
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
You say that like your dad

342
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,800
doesn't write cryptograms on you
while you're unconscious.

343
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,520
Got to be a clue to his next move.

344
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,280
Spoiler alert his next move
is killing you, Agent Moore.

345
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,680
I swear,
when I asked you to cover for me,

346
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,720
I had no idea he'd become
so obsessed with you.

347
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
It's not your fault.

348
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,400
Hold up.
You were the one who solved

349
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,960
Clue Master's puzzle back in the day?

350
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
Agent Moore took the bullet.

351
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,800
There's got to be a key built in.

352
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,800
If I can find the key,
I can crack the message

353
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
and stop him before he makes
his move on you.

354
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,360
Why would your dad do this to you?

355
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,080
I grew up trying
to solve his puzzles.

356
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,880
As I got better,
he used me as a barometer.

357
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,360
If I couldn't solve them,
they were good,

358
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,520
so this morning
after he flew the coop

359
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,080
he paid me a visit.

360
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,480
He thought I'd be his partner
in crime

361
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,600
tried to enlist me
in his little revenge scheme.

362
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,720
He said
that it took Einstein 10 years

363
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,040
to crack general relativity

364
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,800
so he wanted his masterpiece
to take half that time.

365
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,280
Five years

366
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,960
hence the fifth anniversary of me
arresting him.

367
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,920
He said now he can finally finish
what he started.

368
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,160
And let me guess,

369
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,040
we won't know what that is
until you crack that thing,

370
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,360
which is when?

371
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Just me? I don't know.

372
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,000
It could take hours,
it could take days.

373
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
What if there were two of you?

374
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,680
It's a cryptogram.

375
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,840
Well, thanks from last year.

376
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,800
Thought you guys said
he was a human computer.

377
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Where's the ram?

378
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,720
I'm sorry. Who are you exactly?

379
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
See if you can figure it out.

380
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,480
I'm smarter than my king.
My technology protects Wakanda.

381
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,880
Your name is Shuri?

382
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,160
You think it'd be as easy
as kissing a frog.

383
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,680
What is happening?

384
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,720
- No idea.
- I think it's how nerds flirt.

385
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,120
I woke a monster by reading
from the book of the dead.

386
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,120
I helped lay an iron giant to rest.

387
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
As smart as I'm mighty,

388
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,600
the chosen one
still gets all the credit.

389
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Stephanie.

390
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,320
I have to admit.
I was not expecting you to get that.

391
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,840
The first letter of every answer
to her clues of badass ladies

392
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,000
spelled out her name.

393
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,440
Clever. Shuri, Tiana,
Evie, pepper, Hermione...

394
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
Great, yeah.

395
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,960
So if we are through
the foreplay section of the night,

396
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,360
can you two geek out
on how to figure out that thing?

397
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,400
- "You're stumped"?
- I see exactly what's going on

398
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
here.

399
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,320
"You're stumped."
That was <i>Quiz Bowl's</i>catchphrase

400
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,880
whenever a contestant lost.

401
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
He wrote it here among a bunch
of random letters.

402
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,920
It's a substitution cipher.

403
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,480
So, we have to encrypt
which units of plain text

404
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,280
have been replaced with cipher text.

405
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,480
How long is that gonna take?

406
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,360
Depends.
Units can be a single letter,

407
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,800
- double letters, mixed.
- Monoalphabetic, Polyalphabetic...

408
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,320
Where do you think
your dad is now?

409
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,720
I figure if we can figure that out
then we don't have to deal with this.

410
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,680
He said he wants to finish
what he started.

411
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,240
<i>Quiz Bowl's</i> the last place
he tried bombing.

412
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,000
Before a stopped him,
so keep working this angle.

413
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
We'll go see if he's there.

414
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,480
I can't believe this is still here.

415
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,080
This show always creeped me out.

416
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,280
What the hell did we just step on?

417
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,840
<i>It's Quiz Bowl time!</i>

418
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,880
Hey! Show yourself!

419
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,760
<i>Welcome to a special edition
of Quiz Bowl, Agent Moore!</i>

420
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,680
- It's got to be a recording.

424
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,680
No. It's weight-sensitive.
You step off, it blows.

425
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,440
<i>Have I got your attention?</i>

426
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,320
<i>Good! Don't blow up!</i>

427
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,600
<i>We'll be right back
after a word from our sponsors.</i>

428
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,280
C4 is wired to the plate.

429
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,400
- Any ideas?
- That whatever we do we do it quick?

430
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,880
He's not here. It is a recording

431
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,920
probably to distract me
from the puzzle he put on Stephanie.

432
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,440
<i>Welcome back to Quiz Bowl.</i>

433
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,200
<i>Can you figure out a way off in time?</i>

434
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,640

00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,440
<i>In the end, you'll solve it.</i>

436
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,720
<i>Until then, are you ready
to win yourself more time?</i>

437
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,480
Yes. Give us more time.

438
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,360
<i>But if you're stumped,
it's instantly game over.</i>

439
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,760
- Great.
- <i>Let's get to the Quiz Bowl.</i>

440
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,320
<i>Today's theme is Gotham villainy.</i>

441
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,160
<i>First clue.
A poor man's version Clue Master,</i>

442
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,920
<i>this questionable wordsmith
turns green with envy</i>

443
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,960
<i>when compared to me,

444
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,320
<i>Is it, A. The Joker,
B. Poison Ivy, or, C. The Riddler?</i>

445
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
- Riddler.
- Riddler.

446
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
I'm not seeing it.

447
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,080
You?

448
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,320
I thought the "y"
if you're was a substitute for "s"

449
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,240
and that would make the "o" a "y,"

450
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,640
and that's when my eyes
started crossing.

451
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,320
Tried the Caesar cipher?

452
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,360
- That's way too boring for him.
- Yeah. I figured.

453
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,280
What's this? Play fair?

454
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Clever.

455
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,920
You know the play fair cipher?

456
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Part of MIT's mystery hunt
my freshman year.

457
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,520
You went to MIT.

458
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,680
Class of '16.

459
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,720
Skipped a few grades.

460
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Why did you?

461
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,000
I was planning on it, but...

462
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
Not smart enough?

463
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,200
- Long story.
- Puzzles were how I earned

464
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,400
my dad's affection.

465
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,760
Called me his little pointer.

466
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,280
Turns out he was just training me
to be

467
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,080
his puzzle-breaking lab rat
so that he could Terrorize Goth...

468
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
Did you crack it?

469
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,640
<i>Quiz Bowl</i> was a decoy.

470
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Okay. So, where is he?

471
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
I'm really sorry, Luke.

472
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
We are ready.

473
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,760
Hit me with it! Let's go!

474
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,880
<i>This frosty foe gave the dark knight
a run for his money.</i>

475
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,840
<i>Is it A. Mr. Freeze B. The Penguin,
or, C. Captain Cold?</i>

476
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
A. Mr. Freeze.

477
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,280
Victor Fries. When his wife got sick,

478
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,920
he tried to freeze her
till the found a cure.

479
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,480
"A run for his money."
The penguin owns Iceberg lounge,

480
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,840
which has a backroom casino.

481
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Angelique used to work there.

482
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
I stand corrected.

483
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
<i>Your final clue.</i>

484
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,840

486
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,080
<i>- Is it A. Victor Zsasz, B...</i>
- A!

487
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,760
- Pretty confident.
- I read about it in the paper.

488
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,880
<i>That's all for this episode
of Quiz Bowl!</i>

489
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,160
<i>Forty-five minutes on the clock,</i>

490
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,840
<i>and remember, Agent Moore,
in the end,</i>

491
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,640
<i>you'll solve it.</i>

492
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,440
What does that even mean?

493
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,720
We should call Batwoman.

494
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,840
She could get us out of this.

495
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,520
Yeah. Because that's a possibility.

496
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,040
How would we even get ahold of her?

497
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,240
- Bat-signal.
- So you just beckon her

498
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,880
and she what, grapples on over?

499
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,560
She's shown up
every time I've turned it on.

500
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,920
Well, it's Friday at 2.00am,
I'm sure she's busy.

501
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,200
You're probably right, Ryan,

502
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,600
and what is your idea again
that we can accomplish in 45 minutes?

503
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,880
We need to replace our weight
on the pressure plate

504
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
- with an exact counterweight.
- And how do we do that?

505
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,120
We call Luke.

506
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,560
The once-powerful queen pin of Gotham
now protecting the city's hero.

507
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
It's pathetic.

508
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,960
I've had enough of this.

509
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,600
Give me Batwoman's name,
or end up all over my Malbec.

510
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
What's in a name?

511
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,200
Circe, Black Mask...

512
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,200
Roman Sionis.

513
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,840
What did you do?
Circe told me her father rescued her

514
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,800
from the Arkham breakout,
so I got to thinking

515
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,320
how would dear, old dad feel
about his precious daughter

516
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,840
hanging out with a guy who wears
a kinky skullcap?

517
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,320
Unless dear, old dad is the guy
in the kinky skullcap.

518
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,640
You just gave me three reasons
to kill you.

519
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,880
Relax. This is a good thing.

520
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,840
You happened to kidnap Gotham's
most illustrious skin seamstress.

521
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,680
I... I make faces, human faces.

522
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,560
If you want your daughter
to stop hiding

523
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,840
behind that cheeseboard,

524
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,440
Then, let me help you.

525
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,560
I can give you
your beautiful daughter back.

526
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Tell me how.

527
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, I'll do one better.
I'll show you.

528
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,080
Sophie's right. We need Batwoman.

529
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,720
Unfortunately, Batwoman
is standing on a bomb at the moment.

530
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,120
Doesn't have to be.

531
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,520
What are you saying?
You want me to tell Sophie?

532
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,240
Maybe it's not the worst thing
in the world.

533
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
What?

534
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,040
Still no answer. Tried 10 times.

535
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,080
Okay. It's a puzzle, guys.

536
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,280
Clue Master said,
"in the end, you'll solve it."

537
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,560
We just need to figure out
what that means.

538
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
I already have.

539
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,000
The answer is there is no answer.

540
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,840
In the end, meaning end of my life,

541
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,120
I'll figure that out.

542
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
The way out is to die.

543
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,920
Ryan, we need to do something.

544
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,440
Easy to say from the cheap seats.

545
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,360
You know this pressure plate
was meant for you, right?

546
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,000
You know there's a terrorist
roaming somewhere

547
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,280
in Gotham who needs to
be stopped, right?

548
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,520
Hey. Okay.
The arguing is not helping.

549
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,880
She is the one refusing to trust me.

550
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Why would a I trust you?

551
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,400
Because not trusting me means
you both die.

552
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,160
I will never trust a Crow,
especially you.

553
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,920
I know you're Batwoman, Ryan!

554
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
What?

555
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
That's crazy.

556
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,760
Mary, please tell her
that sounds crazy.

557
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's...

558
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,280
Insane? That's insane.

559
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,240
We can keep
this little charade going.

560
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,840
While you're both standing on a bomb

561
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
or you can tell me
what to do to save you.

562
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,240
Go to Kate's office at Wayne.

563
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,080
There's a necklace on the shelf.

564
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,760
You turn it,
and it'll open up an elevator.

565
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,920
If you take it all the way down

566
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,760
you'll end up in a cave
with a bunch of gadgets.

567
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,000
Grab the red-and-black baton.

568
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Smart choice.

569
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
I'll be back.

570
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,680
It explains why Sophie came over
with that big-ass bottle of tequila.

571
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,200
What are you even talking about?

572
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,240
She was trying to liquor you up,
because we both know you can talk,

573
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,760
to get you to confirm her suspicions
about me.

574
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,000
She would never do that.

575
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,480
Really? Why?
Because she's your friend?

576
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,040
You and Luke were on my ass

577
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,520
for putting Angelique's life
before protecting my identity.

578
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,520
Where's your concern for it now?

579
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,360
I don't think
that this is about protecting

580
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,600
- your identity.
- Really? Then what is this about?

581
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,640
That you hate the Crows so much

582
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,880
you can't think rationally.

583
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,760
I know your history with them,

584
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,200
and I know how awful
they were to you,

585
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,120
but we're standing on a bomb, Ryan

586
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
and you would rather
watch it tick down

587
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,560
with me on it

588
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,560
than trust
a legitimately good person,

589
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,160
so thank god
Sophie knew you were Batwoman

590
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,880
because now we might actually
have a chance at not dying.

591
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
My childhood home?

592
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,640
I'll give you a clue.

593
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,760
Your puzzles are getting easier.

594
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,480
On the contrary, pointer.

595
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,160
You're getting smarter,
maybe even smarter than me.

596
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
You know it's a dog, right?

597
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,280
Why are you wearing
that creepy outfit?

598
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,320
For years,
I held a grudge against a quiz show

599
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,160
For dumbing down their answers.

600
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
My world was so tiny back then.

601
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,920
Oh, but there's nothing
like five years in prison

602
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,680
to expose you to all the ignorance
and stupidity on this planet.

603
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,840
Let's weed them out together.

604
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,440
What, because you're such a genius?

605
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,440
Your fight's not with agent Moore.

606
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,840
No rookie cop's smart enough
to outwit the master.

607
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,520
You don't get it.
She didn't outwit you.

608
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,320
Then, why did I spend
the last five years behind bars?

609
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,440
Because I put you there.

610
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,880
I saw your puzzle in the gazette,
I solved it.

611
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,920
I spoiled your plans
by calling the Crows.

612
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,560
Agent Moore answered.
I begged her to say that it was her

613
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,160
So, that you wouldn't do to me
what you were gonna do

614
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,320
to all those innocent
quiz bowl winners.

615
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,200
I taught you, I nurtured you,
I... I made you in my image.

616
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,320
Why would you betray me?
We're the same.

617
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,720
One difference, dad.
You're going back to prison.

618
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
What?

619
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
What are you doing, Dad?

620
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,760
What, you're gonna kill us both?

621
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,360
Life is a puzzle, Stephanie.

622
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,840
This is the only piece that fits.

623
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,480
No. No! Dad, unlock the door!

624
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,680
Unlock the door!

625
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,160
Stephanie, get down! Get down!

626
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,680
Hey. You okay?

627
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
How did you find me?

628
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,320
Just because I didn't go to MIT
doesn't mean I didn't get in.

629
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,960
I'm sorry, Mary. You're right.

630
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,960
I don't trust her,
and now it's gonna get us killed.

631
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
It's just...

632
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,720
When I walked in tonight
and interrupted girl talk

633
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,840
between you and Sophie...

634
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,120
If you want to talk, Mary,
talk to me.

635
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,360
She thinks my dad's on Snakebite.

636
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,920
What? You're no way.

637
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,520
Yeah. That's what I said,

638
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,160
but she found
a used syringe in his office, and...

639
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,600
It does.
It matches some strange behavior

640
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,440
and if you think about everything
that he's lost...

641
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,560
Both wives, Beth, Kate.

642
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,400
I mean,
after he closed down the clinic

643
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,640
he pretty much lost me too.

644
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,080
Can you blame him
for wanting to escape all this?

645
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,080
Sophie just wanted to check in on me.

646
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,120
She just wants to see me happy.

647
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
Well, let's just hope she wants
to see you alive.

648
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
Pretty sure she does.

649
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,720
I got it! What's the plan?
Go up to the big stage door,

650
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,000
open it all the way, and take cover!

651
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,760
- What are you gonna do?
- Go!

652
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,160
What... What the...?

653
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,040
You okay?

654
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,760
That was awesome.

655
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,480
Like I said, you can trust me.

656
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,360
He couldn't stand to live in a world
where I was smarter than him.

657
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,640
Well, according to the EMT,
he's gonna make a full recovery,

658
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,640
so I guess his consequence
will be having to.

659
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,560
You know you're nothing like him,
right?

660
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,760
Genetically, I'm 50 percent him,

661
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,800
which basically means a coin flip

662
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,800
will determine
if I eventually go full Vader.

663
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,160
Okay. It's not gonna happen.

664
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,760
Took you out pretty effortlessly.

665
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,080
Okay. A. it was a cheap shot,

666
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,680
and, B. you were protecting me.

667
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,840
- I was protecting you?
- Yeah.

668
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,640
You knew he'd be here,
and you knew he was dangerous.

669
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,120
Only thing you didn't know
is that I'd be able

670
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,360
to apply your keyword.

671
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,920
It took me a minute
to find an Arthur Brown

672
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,400
who once lived
on Sycamore Ave, though.

673
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,880
Grew up in this house.

674
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,360
I spent my entire childhood trying
to impress a miserable egomaniac,

675
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
and for what?

676
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,040
For him to try and kill me?

677
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,840
I don't want anything to do with him.

678
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
And you don't have to.

679
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
You will find your own people.

680
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
I did.

681
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,360
I'd give you my number,
but I have a feeling

682
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,640
you're smart enough to figure it out.

683
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,720
Hey, Dad.
Stopped by the penthouse

684
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,880
and the doorman
said he hadn't seen you in days.

685
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,040
Where are you? I'm worried, okay?
Call me back.

686
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Mary, need you stat!

687
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,960
Oh, my god. What happened?

688
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,640
Couple homeless guys found him
in burn side park.

689
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,160
Snakebite injector still in his leg.

690
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,200
Dad, Dad.
Get the paddles! He's coding.

691
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,840
Dad, stay with me, okay? Dad!

692
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
Dad!

693
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,560
So, maybe Clue Master
was right all along.

694
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,840
You are good at puzzles.

695
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,760
How did you put the pieces together
that I was Batwoman?

696
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,960
When we infiltrated False Face.

697
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,680
I found the drive assist bat tech
under the steering console.

698
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,640
I had it analyzed and replaced

699
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,200
before you even noticed
it was missing.

700
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,120
It contained recorded audio
of you telling Luke

701
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,880
you wished
you were in the bat mobile.

702
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,560
Damn. I'm not your enemy, Ryan.

703
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,040
You mean you're not Batwoman's enemy

704
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,320
because we both know a few days ago

705
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,160
you thought Ryan Wilder was an ex-con
without a future.

706
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,040
And I'm here to say I was wrong

707
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
And I'm sorry.

708
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Prove it.

709
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Keep this from the Crows.

710
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
I already have.

711
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,320
The other day when Agent Tavaroff

712
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,320
was running Batwoman's DNA
for an I.D.

713
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,080
I erased the one casefile
it could be traced back to...

714
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,960
Ryan Wilder.

715
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,720
I know what it's like to be outed.

716
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,040
I didn't want to force you
to trust me.

717
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,160
I wanted to earn it.

718
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,440
I hope this is a start.

719
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,760
How do I know you won't kill me
the second I put this on her?

720
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,920
You don't. It's called suspense.

721
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,320
The correct answer
is because a mask like this

722
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,760
requires touchups.

723
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,680
You may have made your millions
selling overpriced wrinkle cream,

724
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,000
but human flesh is my department.

725
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Put on the damn face!

726
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,960
I assume you have a concealer
in her skin tone.

727
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,760
Well, unless you want her looking
like Michael Meyers.

728
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,120
Are you sure this is...

729
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,640
Really what you want Circe?

730
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,360
I want to be me again.

731
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,360
That's all well and good,
but the real Circe died in Arkham.

732
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,000
I know
because I was one of the inmates

733
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,920
who stepped over her dead body
on my way out the door.

734
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,560
My name is Circe Sionis.

735
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,280
If you say so.

736
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,320
Now, this will be close

737
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,240
but it won't be perfect.

738
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,200
That wasn't the agreement.

739
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,160
Oh. No. I'm sorry.

740
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,280
My work is exquisite

741
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,720
but the girl in this photo
has brown eyes

742
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,200
and yours, my dear, are blue.

743
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,960
But eyes
and their adorable, little sockets.

744
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,120
Are your specialty...

745
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
You.

746
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
How are you...

747
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,800
Your eyes.

748
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,960
You have our father's eyes.

749
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Kate.
