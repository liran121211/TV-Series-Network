Whatever drama Alice has with
you people, I'm not part of it.

- Yeah.

Oh. I'm that guy,

but that happy, little tune

198

took from the computer?

Aren't you literally Mary Hamilton?

00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:32,781
I sold my share of the company
when my mom died,

217
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:35,798

with the board of stuffy suits.

Wait. You're a multibillionaire?

Why am I only making 12.50

Uh, we can talk about it...

00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:14,461
Don't bother. It's Victor Zsasz.

231
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,247
He's a hitman. He logs
his kills with hash marks.

Because I know people who know him.

in the same circles.

- MARY: Ran in the same circles, okay?

Yeah, so you could
have a front row seat.

it's not worth sending a message

I didn't blow up your sister's plane.

You're looking at me wondering
which old white guy I am?

Ugh. Kids today. No sense of history.

305
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,898
Yeah. Not gonna sweat some freak

Well, at least it's my skin

308

because... and I'm only being honest...

309
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:16,057
you don't seem very
comfortable in yours.

310
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,426
It's like...

311
00:16:17,428 --> 00:16:21,261
Trying to pass for somebody else.

312
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:23,329
I didn't design the damn suit.

313
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:27,101
Heh. I can tell...

314
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:31,037
because I don't see the Batwoman in you,

315
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,554
and maybe that's because...

316
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:36,611
I don't see the you in Batwoman.

317
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:39,846

00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:59,412
I dove out of a flaming building

322
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:00,583
just for a list of names?

323
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:02,474
MARY: Just a prolific hitman

00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:05,077

Anyone else have a pit in their stomach?

326
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:09,916
Let's figure out who they are first.

327
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:12,487
Janet Evans is...

328
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,391
a ninth grade biology teacher.

329
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:18,595
Paul Akins... plumber.

330
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:21,237
Jamal Walker... stock broker.

331
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,607
I... I don't get this. I'm
not seeing a connection.

332
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,478
There's no way we can
protect all these people.

333
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,186
What if we don't have to?

334
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:34,990
Zsasz doesn't find work, work finds him,

335
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:38,993
meaning someone hired
him to get this list.

336
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:41,291
We figure out who he works for,

337
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,060
and we stop them.

338
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,950
- But how?
- I ask him.

339
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:46,919
Because he really opened
up to you the last time.

340
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:49,455
Not as Batwoman. As Ryan.

341
00:17:49,457 --> 00:17:50,807
Are you insane?

342
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:53,359
Why would a hitman rat out his employer?

343
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:58,648
But he does know who you are

344
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,901
or at least of you peripherally,

345
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:03,836
so it's worth a shot.

346
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:05,504
Or you become a tally mark

347
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:06,573
over his right eyebrow.

348
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:09,842
Or I find out who hired him.

349
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,977
You're a billionaire, right?

350
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:14,014
How much of that is liquid?

351
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,897
Plenty of open seats elsewhere.

352
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:35,034
You don't remember me.

353
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:37,703
I dated Angelique Martin.

354
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:39,706
You're Angelique's ex?

355
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,409
Heh heh heh.

356
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,413
Then by all means,

357
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,516
stay and do whatever you want.

358
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:48,881
Just don't do to me what you did to her.

359
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:50,449
So you do know me.

360
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,451
I know you broke her heart.

361
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:53,753
Apologies if I'm overstepping.

362
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:56,422
I'm just a sucker for lesbian drama.

363
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:58,924
Heh heh. She was bad for me.

370

Her Wonderland gang killed my mom.

371
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:35,794
Sideways doesn't mean my job's over.

372
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,663

373
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:39,032
Heh.

close enough to his phone?

376

LUKE: Yep. Vacuumed up all his data

377
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:02,856

his most recent contacts,

you still matter to me.

one of your men, the Rifle.

your Desert Rose serum.

- Had.
- Killing lackeys.

401

Sounds tedious.

402

Or thorough.

403

So why is Alice still alive?

407
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:39,351
Safiyah prides herself

408
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:43,021
on being a fair and just ruler.

409
00:21:43,023 --> 00:21:46,758
Safiyah took her in,
groomed her to be a soldier,

410
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,762
and promised her an eternity

411
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:50,905
of protection and health.

412
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:52,707
But Alice had her heart
set on destroying

413
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:55,344
the Kane family back in Gotham.

414
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:57,503
So let me guess.

415
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:59,005
Alice betrayed her?

416
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:05,518
Alice broke the cardinal
rule of the island.

417

418

SAFIYAH: I've forgiven you for
what you did all those years ago...

Which is why it's going
to be much harder

You exposed the secret of
the Desert Rose to the world.

423
00:22:32,506 --> 00:22:36,341
Coryana is the garden,
and I am its keeper.

424

to protecting its secret.

Coryana is no different.

Our garden will be ravaged,

will cease to exist.

Well, maybe you should
have thought about that

434

I didn't bring down her jet.

00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:10,564
of the Desert Rose to the world.

437
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:13,668
I gave it to just one person,

718
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:16,668
You're here.

719
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,938
NTSB found Kate's phone in the wreckage.

720
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,873
Since you and Mary
wouldn't answer my calls,

721
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,211
I had the tech team on all night

722
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:25,414
trying to override the password.

723
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,917
Actually, that's why I'm here.

724
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:29,386
Do you have any idea what in the hell

725
00:41:29,388 --> 00:41:31,184
Kate was doing looking into a painting

726
00:41:31,186 --> 00:41:34,505
by Jack Napier?

727
00:41:34,507 --> 00:41:38,109
Maybe we can ask her
when we find her, sir.

728
00:41:38,111 --> 00:41:39,912
I think Kate's alive.

729
00:42:10,354 --> 00:42:12,855
MAN: Greg, move your head!
