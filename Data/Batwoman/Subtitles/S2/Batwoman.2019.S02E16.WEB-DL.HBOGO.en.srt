1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,520
Oh, God.

2
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,680
Hey!

3
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,200
Batwoman to Batcave.

4
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
We need medics to the rooftop
lot above Harper's Plaza.

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,720
<i>Batwoman to Batcave. Do you copy?</i>

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,560
<i>I need medics now.
Batwoman to Batcave!</i>

7
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,760
You never told me the 911 operator
was a Batwoman fangirl.

8
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,000
Dude's gonna live.

9
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,840
I should have told you
not to work tonight.

10
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,760
You know, I might just
need a little time.

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Of course.

12
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,320
Mary and I can cover Bat duties,
try to I.D. the stabby chick

13
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,040
- making lawyer kabobs.
- I mean...

14
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,240
I need time alone.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Copy.

16
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,040
You know I'm here
if you need me, right?

17
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,400
{\an5}Special Agent Russell Tavaroff
has just been released on bond.

18
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,080
{\an5}He'll be a free man as he awaits trial

19
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,400
{\an5}accused of falsifying
evidence to justify

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,240
{\an5}the shooting of an
unarmed Gotham citizen.

21
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,200
The uproar over Crows misconduct
has been ignored by Gotham officials

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,680
until one hero spoke up,

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,400
{\an5}<i>former Crows Commander Jacob Kane.</i>

24
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,760
<i>Two Crows agents shot...</i>

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,680
Jacob Kane.

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,280
I expose Kane as the godfather
of a fraudulent security racket,

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,040
{\an5}and now these cloying
half-wits in the fake news

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,200
{\an5}are crowning him a hero.

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,040
{\an5}Haven't you done enough, Roman?

30
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,520
{\an5}You imprisoned the man's daughter,
then brainwashed her into your own.

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,560
He murdered my Circe.

32
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,440
{\an5}So, toying with Kane's
daughter is your way of...

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,640
{\an5}feeling better about him
killing yours?

34
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,200
{\an5}I apologize, Your Royal Highness

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,880
{\an5}but when you gave me the details

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,680
{\an5}of Kate Kane's flight
out of National City

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,320
you knew exactly
what I had in mind for her.

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,400
{\an5}Speaking of you owing me a favor

39
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,960
{\an5}I was hoping to employ
your daughter's services

40
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,880
{\an5}to settle my affairs in Gotham.

41
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,720
I have reason to believe
that Circe's unique

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,840
attributes could benefit us both.

43
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,960
{\an5}Whatever it is,
I don't want her involved.

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,920
{\an5}She's finally got her life back.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,440
{\an5}Last I heard, she was running around

46
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,040
{\an5}with a tree stapled to her face.

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,200
{\an5}Oh, she's ready
to make her grand reentry

48
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,120
{\an5}into Gotham's influencer life.

49
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,080
{\an5}After all, my P.R. team
covered up the incident

50
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,000
that landed her in Arkham
to begin with

51
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
{\an5}and her death, yada yada.

52
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,080
{\an5}They've put together
a very millennial cover story

53
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,800
{\an5}to explain her disappearance.
Three words...

54
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,120
{\an5}Malibu, rehab, retreat.

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,480
{\an5}This is the crown jewel.

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,880
<i>A life lived but once</i>

57
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,040
<i>is a life lived not at all.</i>

58
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,400
<i>The newest line from
Janus Cosmetics has arrived...</i>

59
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
<i>Rebirth.</i>

60
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,000
It wasn't enough

61
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,080
{\an5}that she believed she was my Circe.

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,520
{\an5}Between the new face
and a strict regimen

63
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,440
{\an5}of Janus restorative burn cream

64
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,960
{\an5}she now looks like her too.

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,720
I know Enigma gave
her Circe's memories

66
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,400
{\an5}but who gave her Circe's face?

67
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,640
{\an5}If you can believe it,
that rambling sewer rat Alice.

68
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,640
{\an5}You brought Kate Kane
and Alice together?

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,200
- When was this?
- Two days ago. Why?

70
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,400
{\an5}Alice is Beth Kane, you idiot.

71
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,920
You're coming with us, kiddo.

72
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,480
{\an5}If you're wearing yoga pants,
this is so much worse than I thought.

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,720
{\an5}Now tell me what I'm walking into.

74
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,200
{\an5}This is a government safe house.

75
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,200
<i>Bidets in the bathroom.</i>

76
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,040
They wouldn't even give us hand soap
for the community center.

77
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,080
Turns out the lawyer
whose computer was stolen

78
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,800
by<i>Kill Bill</i> superfan was
working with judges

79
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,080
<i>to place people
into witness relocation.</i>

80
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,240
And all that top-secret location
information was on his computer.

81
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,000
<i>Exactly, so sword lady's
looking for somebody</i>

82
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,400
<i>in witness relocation,
so I placed a trace</i>

83
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
<i>on all of his outgoing calls,</i>

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,160
assuming that he'd reach
out to the witnesses,

85
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,120
- give them a heads-up.
- And you figured all that out?

86
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,240
<i>Oh, you know, I may have outsourced
the fancy parts to Sophie.</i>

87
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
<i>Anyway, we are starting with this guy</i>

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,440
<i>because the lawyer called
him first, called him a lot,</i>

89
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,680
<i>but he never picked up.</i>

90
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,360
Starting to know why.

91
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,840
Found our vic.
Same perp left a sword in him.

92
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,320
Definitely trying
to make a statement.

93
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,080
Oh, man. Poor guy was blind.

94
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,480
This isn't your fight, Batwoman.

95
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,080
Why is that?
Because I can actually fight back?

96
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Tatiana?

97
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,040
<i>DNA match complete.</i>

98
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,440
My God.

99
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,280
It really is you.

100
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,760
You've got me confused
with a dead girl.

101
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,560
No, you've got you
confused with a dead girl.

102
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,800
Two dozen inmates used
Circe Sionis as a doormat

103
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,120
on their way out of Arkham.

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Listen.

105
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
I know this is a lot to handle.

106
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Hey!

107
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,720
Sorry, but did you want her
to escape?

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,320
How do we get Kate back?

109
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,240
There's a secret keyword
to unlock her memories

110
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,120
except the woman
who did that to her is dead.

111
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,280
The other option is we jog
her memory piece by piece

112
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,640
- using personal objects.
- That's where these come in.

113
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,640
Everything that's left
of Kate's childhood.

114
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,680
I'm sorry. Who are you?

115
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,520
Ocean, meet Daddy.
Daddy, meet Ocean.

116
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,320
- Good to meet you, Mr. Kane.
- Right.

117
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,760
What do we do now?

118
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,280
When Enigma locked
me out of my memories

119
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,720
I forced my way back
in with a photograph.

120
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,360
Her work is formidable

121
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
but...

122
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
As soon as the first crack appears

123
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
she'll go mad wanting
to know the truth about her life.

124
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Enigma worked on you too?

125
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Daddy, you don't get this extra
without a little shove.

126
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,200
- I thought the shove was Cartwright.
- No. He didn't fully break me.

127
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,200
- I was too strong.
- I can attest to that.

128
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,920
Alice may have been angry
and reckless and ornery

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,480
but... she could still love.

130
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,800
What are you saying, that... Enigma
took away your ability to love?

131
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,760
I'll let you get on with it.

132
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kane.

133
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,560
Yeah. This Mr. Kane thing
is definitely weird for me.

134
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,520
I want the guy to like me.
Call me old-fashioned.

135
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,840
If you told me I'd be in
the Crows headquarters

136
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,720
with my father, my sister,
and my... boy toy

137
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,560
and I wouldn't be the one in cuffs...

138
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,080
No one ever accused you
of being predictable.

139
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,640
Call you later.

140
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Good.

141
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,840
Ezra Castellanos. Never heard of him.

142
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,440
Probably,
because up until a few days ago,

143
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,400
he was being protected by Crows
Security in witness protection.

144
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,680
Five years ago, Ezra's eyes
were gouged out with a soup spoon

145
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,240
by a woman named Circe Sionis.

146
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,000
So, this case was sealed

147
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,720
but Luke has a thingy
that unseals seals.

148
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Okay. Then.

149
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,880
Circe's the daughter
of Janus Cosmetics

150
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,920
founder Roman Sionis.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,560
Former model claimed self-defense
after Ezra assaulted her at a party

152
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,000
and after she went to Arkham,

153
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,360
Ezra was afraid the Sionis
family would come after him,

154
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,600
so he went into WITSEC.

155
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,800
Didn't Alice stop by the other day

156
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,280
asking if someone named
Circe showed up to you?

157
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,360
- Yeah and now I'm just confused.
- Yeah. I'm gonna check on Luke.

158
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,480
Well, we could try and track him down
with his fancy hacker tools.

159
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,400
Assuming you know
which buttons to press.

160
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Okay.

161
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,400
You stalking me, Fox?

162
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,680
It's law enforcement only.

163
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,640
They let you in and last I checked,

164
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,040
your new occupation
is unemployed haircut.

165
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,400
Two whiskeys neat.

166
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
Look. I understand
the problem here, okay?

167
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,840
Yeah. I'm free on bail,

168
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,840
my charges are gonna be dropped
and as far as the law is concerned,

169
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,800
well, we're back
to you being a car thief

170
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,400
who pulled a gun, so...

171
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,240
I'm not throwing my career away
because your daddy didn't teach you

172
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
how to stay out of the wrong
place at the wrong time.

173
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,520
Oh. See, if I were you,
I would not talk about my father.

174
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,440
You come here looking for a fight?

175
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,360
You looking for another
fake excuse to shoot me?

176
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,040
So, how do you propose
we settle this?

177
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,360
Now I heard you won
the Crows hold them tournament

178
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,000
two years in a row.

179
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,000
You are a stalker.

180
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,320
Really hope you have a plan, kid.

181
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,280
You know, some of us are
just here to play cards.

182
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I like punk rock. How edgy.

183
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,480
You should remember this bag.

184
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,520
I found a joint in this pocket,

185
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,680
- grounded you for the entire summer.
- Harsh. It wasn't even coke.

186
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,280
You think he would try memories
I would actually want to remember.

187
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,840
You said it ended up being
the best summer you ever had.

188
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,880
I am not Kate Kane.

189
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,360
And even if I was, what makes you
think

190
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,880
I would want to come back
to a father

191
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,600
who stopped looking
for both daughters

192
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,720
and a literal evil twin?

193
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,320
What am I missing?

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This.

195
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,320
When we were kids,
you had a big crush

196
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,760
on Jenny Goldberg.

197
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,200
You only liked her
because she skateboarded

198
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,040
but you were so excited
because she liked you back

199
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,320
except you weren't out yet.

200
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,160
You wanted to tell me you were gay,
but you kept chickening out.

201
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,080
You knew I had
to be the first to know...

202
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,120
but I was also the hardest

203
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,320
because I mattered
the most to you, me...

204
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
Beth...

205
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,360
your twin who spent nine months
in the womb with you

206
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,760
and you were scared
of pushing me away

207
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,440
so I made you that stupid mug
to say I already knew

208
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,800
and I loved you.

209
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,520
- I'm locked in a room.
- What room?

210
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,120
A... a basement, a cell.

211
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,120
- I... I can smell formaldehyde.
- Cartwright's.

212
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,520
I can't get out.

213
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,920
Why am I here?

214
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Who's there?

215
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,160
Beth? Beth, is that you?

216
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,320
That's the basement
I spent my childhood in.

217
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,520
You've been there.

218
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,880
Do you remember?

219
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,520
It's... it's more of a feeling I'm...

220
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,800
I'm screaming,
but I can't get your attention.

221
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,400
That... that's not what happened.

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,760
Maybe it's a metaphor.
Circe's subconscious is a cell,

223
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,320
- and Kate needs me to free her.
- How can you be sure?

224
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,160
Because it's all I ever wanted.

225
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,320
Okay. I'm gonna take your hands,
so just...

226
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,040
Don't break mine.

227
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Beth?

228
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Are you there?

229
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,480
Kate, it's me. I'm here.
I'm not gonna leave you.

230
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,760
I remember now.

231
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,640
You found me,

232
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,160
- but I couldn't find you.
- It's okay.

233
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,040
There's still time.

234
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,520
Poker? Really? We need you home.
We think Safiyah's in Gotham.

235
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,360
- Thought you and Safiyah were good.
- We are, but the guys who her lackey

236
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,200
ran her sword through can't
really say the same thing.

237
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,680
Okay. Well, you said
you and Mary got this,

238
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,600
and I'm in the middle
of a game right now, so...

239
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,240
Look. We will give you
the space to do your thing,

240
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,400
but we need a hand.

241
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,880
In this family, we take care
of each other first, right?

242
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,120
Every doctor in that hospital
thought I was gonna die

243
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,240
in that bed, but you and Mary

244
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,280
slipped me the Desert Rose
and I woke right up.

245
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,160
Okay. If there was a thank
you somewhere in there, I...

246
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,320
I didn't want to wake up.

247
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,720
How can you say that?

248
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,440
When I was under, I saw my dad

249
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,800
and, I mean, he was right there.

250
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,160
Why the hell would I want to live

251
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
in a world where we
get shot for no reason,

252
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,200
where the gunmen get out of jail free
so it's not a matter of if

253
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,560
there's another bullet coming,
it's when?

254
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,400
Why would I go through it

255
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,720
when I can be with my dad again?

256
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,760
I got to get back to my game.

257
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,760
What? What do you mean Kate's alive?

258
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,200
She was declared dead. Julia I.D.ed

259
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,880
her parietal skull bone.

260
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,520
Her DNA checks out.
I ran her prints myself.

261
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,200
Look. Everything's a little
bit complicated just now.

262
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,520
The only thing you need to know
is that Kate is alive

263
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,880
and safe with me at Crows,
where no one can hurt her.

264
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,040
Okay. I'm on my way.

265
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,440
Just give us a little bit more time.

266
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,760
She's not quite herself.
Someone brainwashed her

267
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
into thinking
that she was someone else.

268
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,000
- Who?
<i>- Turns out Black Mask</i>

269
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,480
is cosmetics guru Roman Sionis.

270
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,120
He hypnotized Kate into thinking
that she was his daughter Circe.

271
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,240
Kate is Circe Sionis.

272
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,720
Dad, you need to be careful.

273
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,720
We have reason to believe
that Circe's connected to Safiyah.

274
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
<i>What? How?</i>

275
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
<i>Dad?</i>

276
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Daddy?

277
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,240
- Run!
- Where?

278
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,360
Anywhere. I'll find you.

279
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Miss me?

280
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,920
<i>He was saying
that the DNA checks out,</i>

281
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,760
<i>but Kate thinks she's Circe Sionis</i>

282
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,320
<i>and she's been alive
this entire time</i>

283
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,480
<i>which doesn't actually make sense</i>

284
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,000
because Julia wouldn't lie
to us and say

285
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,800
that she found Kate's skull
because everybody knows

286
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,320
that you can't survive
without a skull!

287
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,760
- Mary.
- Sorry. Just freaking out right now.

288
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,440
Me, too. Pulling up to the Crows.

289
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,600
Luke needs to know that Kate's alive.

290
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,280
I know we did the right
thing saving his life

291
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
and I knew he'd have
a lot to work through, but...

292
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,440
Right now, it feels like
we just added to his pain.

293
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,760
It sucks.

294
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,480
I'm glad to have you
on the comms, Batcave.

295
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,760
I'll call you back.

296
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,000
Are you Kate Kane?

297
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,560
Can I get back to you on that?

298
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Need a ride?

299
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,760
Call.

300
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,360
Raise.

301
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm out.

302
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Reraise.

303
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,800
All-in.

304
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,800
Oh. Sorry. Do I have you covered?

305
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,440
Yeah. I have a lot more
chips than you.

306
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,760
Look. If you got me beat and you want
to start a little collection

307
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,600
with your buddies here
so you can match my chips

308
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
I'll just hang out.

309
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,360
You want to let me in
on the grudge with this?

310
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,840
What? Grudge?
This is just a friendly game.

311
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Okay.

312
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,600
Why haven't I seen you
around here before?

313
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,800
Name's John Diggle.
I'm from Star City.

314
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,600
I'm in town on a contract
with A.R.G.U.S.

315
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,240
Well, hey. Welcome.

316
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,760
Please. Allow me
to remove this little...

317
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,120
Distraction,

318
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,640
who's been playing with us.
Buddy, Gotham City is our town

319
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,840
and the house always wins.

320
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,600
I mean, people do say that.

321
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,680
It's true. The house does win a lot
because it cheats.

322
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,720
But then sometimes, I mean, the house
is just so damn stupid

323
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,160
that it can cheat

324
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,640
and still manage to lose.

325
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,520
The man made a straight.

326
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,320
What no applause

327
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
for that, for that
gut-shot straight draw?

328
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,240
I mean and the speech?
No style points for that?

329
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,240
Okay. Whatever.

330
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,360
I've been running
from this fight my whole life...

331
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,880
And it has gotten me nowhere.

332
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,280
First you're up, then you're down.

333
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,520
I don't know if you're
gonna take any comfort

334
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,600
from this, Jake, but, now,
you're down and out for good.

335
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,480
True for both of us, Black Mask,

336
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,520
unless you think Gotham's
gonna buy its zit cream

337
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,440
- from a psychotic gang leader.
- Tough call. It's a good zit cream.

338
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,040
On the topic of hereditary diseases,

339
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,280
Gotham is about to find out
that your daughter, Beth Kane

340
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,120
is none other than
the knife-slinging,

341
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,560
nursery-rhyme-named Alice.

342
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,040
My people will make sure
GCPD is on your doorstep

343
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,840
before you can clear this up.

344
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,480
GCPD on my doorstep?
You know what?

345
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,680
That's a fantastic idea. Gentlemen.

346
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,160
If you try to blow the whistle

347
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,480
on the Sionis family,
not only will the public

348
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,280
think you're as crazy as
your daughter,

349
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,200
but the GCPD will,
misplace any evidence

350
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,640
you happen to dig up
and I will personally make sure

351
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,680
that any family you have left
suffers immensely.

352
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,320
Jacob Kane, you're under arrest

353
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,520
for aiding and abetting
the criminal at large known as Alice.

354
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Come on.

355
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,080
Is this what you really wanted?

356
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,960
I'm taking my money back.

357
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,680
That's enough!

358
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,120
Easy, Star City.

359
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,680
- It's not your fight.
- He won.

360
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,400
You saw the blatant disrespect
at the table.

361
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,120
In Gotham City, we hold the line
against punks like this.

362
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,760
I hear you shot him the other day,

363
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,520
and now you're upset that
he's not showing you respect?

364
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,600
I never thought I'd see you again.

365
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm sorry. Who are you?

366
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,320
I think she's still
trying to figure things out.

367
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh. Yeah. Of course. Right.

368
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,200
Just any questions you have, I'm here
or not, you know.

369
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm not trying to smother you.

370
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,640
- I need a drink.
- I...

371
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,360
Did you find my dad?

372
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,200
No. She said a bunch
of False Face goons raided the joint.

373
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,560
Then she described someone
wearing a hair chain

374
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,320
and holding two big-ass swords.

375
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,880
- Tatiana.
- She thinks Tatiana wanted Alice.

376
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,880
Alice was at the Crows
with, with my dad?

377
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,560
- Literally, what is happening?
- Kate?

378
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,000
Okay. Don't get too excited.

379
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,440
There's still a lot
she doesn't remember.

380
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Sophie.

381
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,200
So, Alice just told
you about some mug

382
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,520
and that was it, really?
Alice? Really?

383
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,000
Where is my father?

384
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,920
Okay. Let's chill.
Just give her a minute.

385
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,080
Hey. We know it's a lot.
Maybe you should sit down.

386
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,840
Yeah. That sounds good.

387
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Beth?

388
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Where are you?

389
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Where did you go?

390
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,240
I think you've caused
quite enough trouble.

391
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,280
Hey, Kate. You're good.
You're safe, okay?

392
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
No!

393
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,960
You just carry one
of those around?

394
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,760
Oh, yeah. Syringe chock full
of benzos?

395
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,160
Comes in handy in Gotham.

396
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,480
- Everyone okay?
- Everyone but Kate.

397
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
What the hell happened?

398
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,640
I think Kate and Circe
are duking it out in her head,

399
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,920
- and Circe's winning right now.
- So, if Alice is the lynchpin

400
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,440
to jogging more of Kate's memories

401
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,640
- and Safiyah has her...
- No, no, no.

402
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,120
Even if I could stomach the idea
of saving Alice's life right now,

403
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,080
Safiyah came all the way from Coryana

404
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,560
for the pyro who torched
her entire kingdom,

405
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,880
so what could we possibly offer her
that would be better than that?

406
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,040
- Gotham steakhouse gift card or...
- She could rebuild that kingdom...

407
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,680
If I give her the Desert Rose.

408
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Ryan...

409
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,840
No. It's your last connection
to your mom.

410
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,440
You're really willing to do that?

411
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,920
Willing is pushing it.

412
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,320
More like we don't have
anything else to bargain with.

413
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,640
Even if you're willing
to make the trade,

414
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
how do we even find her?

415
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,080
Maybe this is a good excuse
to show Luke

416
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,280
just how badly his friends need him.

417
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Hey. You good?

418
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Yeah.

419
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,040
Your old man's Lucius Fox, right?

420
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,640
Put together some details
when you were having

421
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,160
that friendly game of hold them.

422
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,360
You lost your old man young.

423
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,480
That's, that's hard, man.
That's real hard.

424
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,280
My old man was a marine
deployed overseas

425
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,240
when I was a boy, killed in action.

426
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,600
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's all right.

427
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,960
But it left me with a lot of
questions about him and me,

428
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,200
so I get it when those questions
become more important

429
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,320
than anything else in the world, man.
Believe me, I get it.

430
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,600
What you have to remember is that

431
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,760
we all end up in the same
place eventually, man,

432
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,160
and you'll see your father soon
enough.

433
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,720
What changes with time
is what you get to tell him

434
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
you did while you were on the earth.

435
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,160
Okay. So...

436
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,680
I'm just supposed to ignore the fact
that I'm still angry as hell?

437
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,640
No, brother. Don't ignore it. Use it.

438
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,680
You carry the torch
for the great Fox family.

439
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,000
You stand for justice.

440
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,840
You're gonna need anger
to win that fight.

441
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,840
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

442
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,160
Just some, fogginess, dizziness.
Something's not right.

443
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,840
Lifetime of anger has its side
effects, you know what I mean?

444
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,880
You know we have a world-renowned
neurology department

445
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,000
at Gotham General?

446
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,280
I can get you a connect if you want.

447
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,520
That's actually why I'm here.
Have an appointment in the morning.

448
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Is it supposed to do that?

449
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
No.

450
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,800
That's highly unusual.

451
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,840
- In fact, I think it's...
- It's morse code.

452
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,280
- Need...
- Fox... Help.

453
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
I should go.

454
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,400
You know, you seem pretty
important for a man

455
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,000
who's trying to get his
ass kicked in an alley.

456
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,480
Good thing you're alive.

457
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Thanks.

458
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,440
Take care of yourself, Luke Fox.

459
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,840
<i>Hello. This is Dana DeWitt,</i>

460
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,240
<i>and I'm coming to you live
from Grand Street downtown</i>

461
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,080
<i>outside of GCPD headquarters.</i>

462
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,960
<i>Earlier today, we got word
of the shocking arrest</i>

463
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
<i>of former Crows Commander
Jacob Kane</i>

464
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,560
<i>who is rumored to be... There he is.</i>

465
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,280
<i>Mr. Kane,
is it true you're the father</i>

466
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
<i>of one of Gotham's
most notorious monsters?</i>

467
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,680
<i>It's not like that, Dana.</i>

468
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,280
<i>Yes, she's my daughter
and her name is Beth.</i>

469
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,640
<i>She's not a monster.</i>

470
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,000
<i>She's a victim of evil men and women</i>

471
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,680
<i>who stole her childhood
and manipulated her mind</i>

472
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
<i>of a father who... who didn't
come through for her</i>

473
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,600
<i>when she needed him.
Beth has had the hardest life</i>

474
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,720
<i>of anyone I've ever known
and yet...</i>

475
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,520
<i>she has this humanity inside of her.</i>

476
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,880
<i>I can't imagine ever
having that strength</i>

477
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,920
<i>so if Gotham is angry at me,
then so be it.</i>

478
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,720
<i>I ask only this of them as a father.</i>

479
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,200
<i>When you judge Alice for her crimes</i>

480
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,720
<i>remember Beth.</i>

481
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
She's in here, my queen.

482
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
My dear...

483
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,320
I believe you owe me an island.

484
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,720
This is deep.

485
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,920
How many times you get hit?

486
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,840
You should've saw him, okay?

487
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Didn't realize poker
was a contact sport.

488
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Wasn't there an emergency?

489
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,000
Safiyah's holding Alice
somewhere in Gotham,

490
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,440
so we need
your brilliant decoder brain

491
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,720
to figure out how to find her...

492
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
and save her.

493
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,360
Okay. I give up.

494
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,960
What are you not telling me?

495
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,240
Kate's still alive.

496
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,920
There's nothing left of Coryana.

497
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,760
Your scorching was
thorough and complete.

498
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,400
Nine villagers perished in the blaze,

499
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,440
so if you have managed
to maintain a list

500
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,000
after all these years,
do include them in your grand total.

501
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,160
You told me you had my sister.

502
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,320
- What did you expect?
- If I'm honest, that,...

503
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,760
a tantrum...

504
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,960
because at the end of the day, Alice,
you're just a spoiled child

505
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,320
who believes she deserves
more than she's earned.

506
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
What is this?

507
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,640
- Chill. I come in peace.
- Let her in.

508
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,920
What are you doing here?

509
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,840
I've had this plant a long time.

510
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,560
I didn't even know what
it was or what it could do

511
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,800
until recently,
but even before I knew,

512
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,320
it was my favorite thing
in the whole world.

513
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,320
- And why is that?
- A woman I counted as my mother,

514
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,120
she died a while back,
and this plant was

515
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,880
my last connection to her.

516
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,000
And yet you brought it to offer

517
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,760
in what I presume is
a trade for Alice?

518
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
Your enemy.

519
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,360
Alice is the key to getting
her sister's memories back.

520
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,880
The choice is easy.
Revenge is short-lived,

521
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,400
but rebuilding your island,
it's a no-brainer.

522
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,280
What I don't understand
is what's in this for you.

523
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
I see someone giving up
her most valued possession

524
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,040
to save a woman she hates

525
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,760
to unlock the memories
of another woman

526
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,000
she doesn't even know.

527
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,440
It's either remarkable
or remarkably stupid.

528
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,640
I know what Kate Kane stands for

529
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,160
and I owe a debt
to the symbol she created.

530
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,280
Found my second chance
at a life because of her.

531
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,800
I've never met her, but...

532
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,000
I believe you'd make Kate Kane proud.

533
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,920
I accept your offer.

534
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,920
If I can't have you,
at least I can have my kingdom.

535
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,600
Thank you... My queen.

536
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,960
I'll make sure to tell Ocean
you send your regards.

537
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,840
Alice, let's go.

538
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,240
It's funny.

539
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,280
Here you are a literal queen

540
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,360
and yet I have my boyfriend
and my sister

541
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,040
and all you have is a little flower.

542
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,560
Oh, there you go again, believing you
deserve more than you've earned.

543
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,560
What did you do?

544
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,840
Where's Tatiana?

545
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,080
Don't play dumb, Alice.

546
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,000
You always knew deep
down a girl like you

547
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,320
could never be worthy
of having it all.

548
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,480
Hey. Easy.

549
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,880
We brought you to a place
we thought you'd be more comfortable.

550
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,800
- You kind of lashed out at Mary.
- I did? Is she okay?

551
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
She's fine.

552
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,600
She's worried about you.

553
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,320
Who am I?

554
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,200
- Whose face is this?
- We'll get to that.

555
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,320
Do you remember anything
you've been

556
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,400
put through all these months?

557
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,920
- Why are you here?
- Because you don't seem

558
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
to want to stay in there
like a good girl

559
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,440
so now we're gonna have
to do things the messy way.

560
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,120
Hey. Are you okay?

561
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,960
Can I get you a glass
of water or something?

562
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,880
I'm gonna need something
stronger than that.

563
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,040
There's an amazing bottle
of tasteless vodka

564
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,160
in my office desk, bottom drawer.

565
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
Would you mind?

566
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,040
- I'll go check.
- Thank you.

567
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,200
- Ocean isn't answering his phone.
- I don't care.

568
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,920
You heard what Safiyah said.

569
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,800
And I didn't give up my plant

570
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,600
so you could run off
to your boyfriend.

571
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,760
- Get in the car!
- Or what?

572
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,840
You'll kill me,
drag me against my will?

573
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,800
You need me alive and cooperative.

574
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,160
I don't need you.
Your sister needs you.

575
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,160
If she really is back
to being Kate Kane

576
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,720
then my disappointing her
will come as no surprise.

577
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,120
Ocean? Ocean?

578
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,160
So, Safiyah took her
little magic knife

579
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,040
out of you
so you could stick it in me.

580
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,680
That's sweet. You can keep it.

581
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,560
This isn't the magic one.

582
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Ocean?

583
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:57,000
No, no, no.

584
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
You're safe? How
is that even possible?

585
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,440
Blackgate's worst offenders are
all people that you put there.

586
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,320
Judge granted my petition
for change of venue.

587
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,160
I'm being transferred to Metropolis.

588
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,320
Okay. That's a start.
I'll start making calls,

589
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,280
line up character witnesses and...

590
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,920
<i>Mary, we're not gonna
beat these charges,</i>

591
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,120
<i>not with Roman Sionis
pulling the strings</i>

592
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,240
<i>and Alice's reputation
hanging over me.</i>

593
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,720
<i>She earned that reputation, not you,
so you don't deserve to take the fall</i>

594
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
for the things that she did.

595
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,840
<i>Mary, I want you to
promise me something.</i>

596
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,280
Seeing Kate and Alice
together gave me hope.

597
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,840
When I saw how Kate was buried

598
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,280
under this grotesque
stranger named Circe

599
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,880
I understood the same thing
must have happened to... to Beth.

600
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,640
<i>If Circe and Alice go away,
we can get Kate and Beth back.</i>

601
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,720
<i>There's only one person</i>

602
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,760
<i>- who can make that happen.</i>
- Dad...

603
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,560
I understood she took a lot from you,

604
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,760
<i>took a lot from all of us, but...</i>

605
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,720
I just wish you could have seen Beth
before the accident.

606
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,480
Hoping one day you get the chance to.

607
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,080
That's why I'm counting on you
to save both your sisters.

608
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,400
No pressure!

609
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,680
Never had to worry about you before.
Not gonna start now.

610
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,560
<i>I love you, Mary.</i>

611
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,800
<i>I love you too.</i>

612
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,280
Remind me to never do
a serial killer a favor again.

613
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,840
I'm sorry you lost your plant.
I know it meant a lot to you,

614
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,400
seeing as I babysat it.

615
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,360
Okay. The plant does not
matter to me right now.

616
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,840
I know you want to see Kate,
but I got something to say.

617
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,120
I am so sorry
for what happened to you.

618
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,040
I have no idea what it's like
to walk in your shoes,

619
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,800
but let me make something very clear.

620
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,320
I am not sorry I made sure you lived

621
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,000
so screw your choice.
You're not leaving me.

622
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,680
- Hey. Did you see Kate down there?
- No. We thought she was up here.

623
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,120
I left for two seconds
to get her something

624
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,720
and when I came back, she was gone.

625
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,600
When did you get in?
I've been calling everybody

626
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
looking for you.

627
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,720
Am I Kate Kane?

628
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,560
Kate Kane? Who? No. No, no,
sweetheart. You're my baby girl.

629
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,960
Why am I having her memories?

630
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,560
Why do I have her fingerprints

631
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,600
and why do I know where she keeps
her fricking alcohol in her office?

632
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,880
You're having an episode.

633
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,600
Let's practice our grounding
techniques.

634
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,760
Tell me what's happening.

635
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,680
You're having an episode,
sweetheart. Please.

636
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,040
Tell her, Roman, or I will.

637
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,440
I've always held the belief
that a woman has a right to decide

638
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,640
exactly who she wants to be.
