Where did that come from?

716
00:37:57,096 --> 00:37:59,063
Because I know how you used to feel,

717
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:00,533
that if you could do it all over again

718
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:02,900
you would have jumped on her bike
and left Point Rock in your dust.

719
00:38:02,902 --> 00:38:05,736
How do you even know that?

720
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:07,690
The question is...

721
00:38:07,692 --> 00:38:12,143
did you still feel that
way two days ago?

722
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:14,146
I don't know.

723
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,017
This is what Kate left in her safe.

724
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:22,420
I didn't read it,

725
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:24,956
but I have a feeling
I know what it says.

if you're reading this,

00:38:52,518 --> 00:38:57,321
it means I'm not here to

I'm Batwoman.

735
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:02,493
Though part of me thinks you always knew

736
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:07,099
even when I did a damn good
job of convincing you otherwise,

737
00:39:07,101 --> 00:39:09,360
I'm telling you this because I know

738
00:39:09,362 --> 00:39:11,134
you'll figure it out eventually,

739
00:39:11,136 --> 00:39:13,404
and I want you to know that lying to you

740
00:39:13,406 --> 00:39:15,673
was the hardest thing I've ever done,

741
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:21,078
but I lied because I love you,

742
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,081
because I wanted to protect you,

743
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:26,784
and because I was scared
that you would push me away,

744
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:28,319
so that's the truth.

745
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:31,489
I hope you think I did
a good job for our city,

746

Good news, my dear Mouse.

I have purpose once again.

00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:12,163
It was Safiyah

757
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:14,698
who ruined everything,

758
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,203
and now I'm going to ruin her.

It's lucky you're dead already,

my dear brother,

761
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:29,580
because there's a war coming to Gotham,

762
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:32,416
and now there's no Batwoman to stop it.

Heh heh heh.

764
00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:53,938
I did the right thing today, Mama,

765
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,209
and I will try to do the
right thing tomorrow

766
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:00,611
and the next day,

767
00:41:00,613 --> 00:41:04,515
and sooner or later, I promise,

I'll be your number one girl again.
