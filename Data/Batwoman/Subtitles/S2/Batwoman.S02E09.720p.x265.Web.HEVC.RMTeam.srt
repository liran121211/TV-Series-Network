THE MAKEOVER THIS CITY NEEDS

COMES FROM AN UGLY

HAVE SEEN THEM,

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,090
TO GET TO IN ORDER TO

345
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,550
SEE ME AGAIN?

346
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,470
WELL, HERE WE ARE.

347
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,640
OF COURSE. I ASK
THE UNIVERSE

348
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,060
FOR MY SISTER,

349
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,270
AND THIS IS
WHAT I GET.

350
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,140
I'M NOT SURE WHY
THAT'S SURPRISING.

351
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,690
YOU NEVER GET
WHAT YOU WANT.

352
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,360
CHEERS TO THAT.

353
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,520
NOTHING ABOUT YOUR PLAN
UNFOLDED THE WAY YOU WANTED.

354
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,780
AFTER WE LEFT YOU IN THIS CELL
FOR 11 YEARS,

355
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,110
YOU SET OUT TO MAKE SURE

356
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,780
YOUR FAMILY NEVER LEFT
YOU AGAIN,

357
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,660
BUT DAD HELPED LOCK YOU
AT ARKHAM,

358
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,830
AND I'M DEAD.

359
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,040
AM I SO MENTALLY
DISTURBED

360
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,170
THAT MY IMAGINATION
CREATED YOU

361
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,790
TO RUB IT IN?

362
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,790
YOU CREATED ME BECAUSE
YOU WERE ALWAYS THE ONE

363
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,590
WHO GOT US INTO TROUBLE,

364
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,670
BUT I WAS ALWAYS THE ONE
CLEVER ENOUGH

365
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,510
TO GET US OUT OF IT.

366
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,970
-WHAT TROUBLE?
-YOUR PAIN.

367
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,350
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
I HAD A WAY

368
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,890
TO MAKE IT DISAPPEAR?

369
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,020
ANG, OPEN UP.
IT'S ME.

370
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,650
HEY.

371
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,150
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GETTING OUT, ANG!

372
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,200
OK. YOUR ENERGY IS
SUPERINTENSE RIGHT NOW.

373
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,030
WHO KILLED
THE COMMISSIONER?

374
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,870
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING

375
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,290
DRIVING THE GETAWAY CAR?

376
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,950
WHO ELSE KNOWS?

377
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,750
THAT IS NOT
THE APPROPRIATE
RESPONSE

378
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,000
TO WHAT I JUST SAID.

379
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,460
YOU WANT ME TO
END UP DEAD?

380
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,040
-WHO ELSE KNOWS?
-I DO!

381
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,710
THAT SHOULD BE
ENOUGH!

382
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,680
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
I WAS DOING THERE.

383
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,590
I SAID I WANTED OUT,
AND THEY WERE WILLING
TO LET ME GO

384
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,970
IF I JUST DID
THIS ONE LAST THING.

385
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,270
THEY GAVE ME A MASK,
KEYS, AND AN ADDRESS.

386
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,270
AM I SUPPOSED TO
BELIEVE YOU RIGHT NOW?

387
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,440
WHEN HAVE I EVER LIED
TO YOU?

388
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,400
IF MY NAME IS OUT,
FALSE FACE WILL KILL ME

389
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,150
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

390
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,690
THEN OUT THEM.

391
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,240
TURN IN THE ACTUAL
KILLERS.

392
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,950
TELL THE COURT WHAT
YOU JUST TOLD ME.

393
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,030
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

394
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,200
FALSE FACE IS RUN
BY A PSYCHOPATH
NAMED BLACK MASK,

395
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,250
WHO WILL LEAVE ME
FOR DEAD IN A SEWER

396
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,500
BEFORE I EVER GET
ON A WITNESS STAND.

397
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,670
I CAN PROTECT YOU.

398
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,130
YOU? HOW?

399
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,470
THIS IS GOING TO
SOUND...INSANE...

400
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,970
BUT...

401
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,730
I KNOW BATWOMAN.

402
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,020
OK.

403
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,950
HOW DO YOU THINK I KNOW
YOU GOT WRAPPED UP
IN THIS CRAP?

404
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,410
[SIGHS]

405
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,950
YOU AND YOUR
COMIC BOOK HEROES.

406
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,410
YEAH. WELL, THANKS
TO ME AND MY
COMIC BOOK HEROES,

407
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,910
YOUR ASS HAS AN OUT
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE IT,

408
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,830
BUT YOU NEED TO TAKE IT.

409
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,540
CAN I THINK
ABOUT IT?

410
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,920
LUKE: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE LETTING HER
THINK ABOUT IT?

411
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,300
SHE JUST GUNNED DOWN
THE COMMISSIONER.

412
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,220
SHE DROVE
THE GETAWAY CAR.

413
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,720
OH, RIGHT. SHE DIDN'T
PULL THE TRIGGER.

414
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,390
SHE JUST STEPPED
ON THE GAS.

415
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,890
YES. PLEASE GIVE HER
ALL THE TIME SHE NEEDS.

416
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,310
RYAN'S RIGHT.
IF JORDAN TESTIFIES

417
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,890
AGAINST FALSE FACE,
THEY'LL KILL HER,

418
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,980
BUT IF ANGELIQUE DOES,
JORDAN DOESN'T HAVE TO.

419
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,810
EXACTLY. ANG
JUST NEEDS TIME.

420
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,320
SHE'LL MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

421
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,820
SHE COULD HAVE GONE
TO THE COPS

422
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,490
WHEN YOU WERE BUSTED
FOR HER DRUGS ON YOU.

423
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,570
-SHE DIDN'T.
-SHE'S CHANGED.

424
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,110
YOU LITERALLY JUST
SAID THE WORDS,

425
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,370
"SHE DROVE
THE GETAWAY CAR."

426
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,750
OK. YOU HAVE
MY BACK, RIGHT?

427
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,210
I'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD
BEFORE WITH ANOTHER
BATWOMAN--KATE--

428
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,880
AND SHE FOUND EVERY
EXCUSE IN THE BOOK

429
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,670
TO JUSTIFY
HER TWIN SISTER'S ACTIONS,

430
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,090
AND YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THE ONE TO REMIND ME

431
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,680
THAT MY MOM DIED
BECAUSE OF IT.

432
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
ANGELIQUE IS NOT ALICE.

433
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,430
NO ONE IS EVER ALICE
UNTIL THEY ARE

434
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,680
BECAUSE SOMEONE
LET THEM BE.

435
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,690
MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WAIT FOR ANGELIQUE
TO TURN HERSELF IN.

436
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,400
YOU CAN DO THAT FOR HER.

437
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,730
Y'ALL ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE MY TEAM.

438
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,650
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE ARE YOUR TEAM,

439
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,610
WHICH MAKES YOU
OUR LEADER.

440
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,530
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO MAKE THE RIGHT CALL.

441
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,200
I'LL GIVE ANGELIQUE
AN HOUR TO TALK,

442
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,290
BUT AFTER THAT,
I'LL CALL THE COPS MYSELF.

443
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,020
NO. I PERSONALLY
NEVER THOUGHT SAFIYAH

444
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,310
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
KATE'S PLANE BLOWING UP.

445
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,810
NOT HER M.O.

446
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,650
THE NTSB CONCLUDED
THAT BASED ON THE WEATHER

447
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,610
AND THE ATMOSPHERE IT WAS
LIKELY A LIGHTNING STRIKE

448
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,860
THAT KNOCKED OUT
THE CONTROLS.

449
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,200
A RECALLED CIRCUIT BREAKER
COULD HAVE SPARKED

450
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,660
AN ELECTRICAL FIRE
IN THE COCKPIT.

451
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,240
I TAKE IT I'M READING
THEIR REPORT

452
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,700
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
BELIEVE THAT.

453
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,160
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS,
I'VE DISCOVERED

454
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,080
THAT ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS
WAS BATWOMAN

455
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,920
WHILE THE OTHER RAN
AN ILLEGAL UNDERGROUND
MEDICAL CLINIC,

456
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,750
SO I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING
AT FACE VALUE ANYMORE.

457
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,390
SIR...I--I CAN'T
EVEN IMAGINE

458
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,060
WHAT YOU MUST BE
FEELING AS A FATHER
RIGHT NOW,

459
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,230
BUT KATE WOULD WANT
YOU TO FIND PEACE.

460
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,440
THEN ELIMINATE EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF HER ENEMIES

461
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,610
WHO COULD HAVE DONE THIS
OR FIND ME THE ONE WHO DID

462
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,860
SO I CAN KILL HIM
MYSELF.

463
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,820
AND...IF I FIND
NOTHING THAT

464
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,620
CONTRADICTS
THIS REPORT,

465
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,330
THEN WILL YOU PLEASE
ACCEPT IT

466
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,580
AS WHAT I BELIEVE
IT IS,

467
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,960
A HORRIBLE
AND TRAGIC ACCIDENT?

468
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,960
CONVINCE ME I'M WRONG,
AND I'LL LET THIS GO.

469
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,970
WOMAN: ♪ I AM
THE ABSOLUTE GODDESS ♪

470
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,720
♪ DON'T GOT THE TIME
TO BE MODEST ♪

471
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,640
THIS IS YOUR IDEA
OF A SAFE SPACE?

472
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,640
I NEED A DRINK,
AND YOU ONLY HAVE
EXPENSIVE WINE

473
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,140
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO LOOK AT.

474
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,770
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BE
IN ANY DANGER RIGHT NOW

475
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,850
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
OUT TAGGING AGAIN.

476
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,860
IT'S HOW I EXPRESS
MYSELF.

477
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,110
THEN GRAB A NOTEPAD.

478
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,690
DEFACING PROPERTY
IS ILLEGAL.

479
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,280
OH, MY GOD.

480
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,030
WHY DID BATWOMAN
HAVE TO SAVE ME?

481
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,490
I--I WAS HAVING
MORE FUN

482
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,240
HAVING A CROWBAR
SWUNG TO MY FACE.

483
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,750
SOUNDS LIKE Y'ALL COULD STAND
TO BE LESS SOBER RIGHT NOW.

484
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,460
TWO CLUB SODAS.

485
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,920
UH, VODKA
WITH A VODKA BACK.

486
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,340
RYAN, THIS IS
MY LITTLER SISTER JORDAN.

487
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,720
HMM. SO YOU WERE SAVED
BY BATWOMAN.

488
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,130
THAT'S DOPE.

489
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,100
YEAH. I MEAN,
IT WAS...FINE.

490
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,640
FINE? IT'S BATWOMAN.

491
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,270
YEAH, BUT SHE'S SO...
CRINGE.

492
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,690
AT LEAST SHE DITCHED
THE PARTY WIG.

493
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,270
HARSH WORDS FOR SOMEONE
WHO JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE.

494
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,400
-SHE'S ONE OF THEM.
-ONE OF WHO?

495
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,360
COPS, CROWS, THE LAW.

496
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,160
JUST ANOTHER SUIT
WHO SHOOTS FIRST
AND ASKS LATER.

497
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,240
RYAN: OK. THEN...

498
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,330
HOW WILL YOU STOP
GOTHAM'S CRIME PROBLEM?

499
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,330
BEFORE IT STARTS.

500
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,540
CURRENTLY, I'M WORKING
WITH GRASSROOTS
ORGANIZATIONS

501
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,630
TO GET FUNDING
FOR A COMMUNITY CENTER
OFF SKID ROW,

502
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,210
I'M ON A COUNCIL
TO MOVE MONEY

503
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,090
TO NEIGHBORHOOD-LED
SAFETY INITIATIVES,

504
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,840
AND I PHONE BANK
FOR NO NEW JAILS
IN GOTHAM CITY.

505
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,640
THIS ONE'S
ON THE HOUSE.

506
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,600
SHE'S...PASSIONATE.

507
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,020
I CAN SEE THAT.

508
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,520
LET'S GO.

509
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,730
OK.

510
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,990
SO...THE VIBES
ARE THERE,

511
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,950
AND SIS JUST CAME
OUT OF THE CLOSET.

512
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,910
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

513
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,950
THIS IS ME BEING

HAVE BEEN PROTECTED.

688
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,530
WHY WOULD SHE DESTROY
THE REST OF HER LIFE

689
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,660
TO COVER FOR A BUNCH
OF FALSE FACE THUGS?

690
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,580

HAD BEEN TEXTING WITH

WHEN WE LEARNED
KATE WAS GONE,

730
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,700
I ASKED MYSELF WHAT
MY LEGACY WOULD BE
AS BATWOMAN,

731

BUT THAT WASN'T
THE RIGHT QUESTION.

WE'VE GOT
EACH OTHER'S BACKS...

739
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,350

-WORKS FOR ME.
-ME, TOO.

SO IF WE'VE GOT
EACH OTHER'S BACK,

742
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,520
THAT MEANS RULE NUMBER TWO.

743
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,730
WE HOLD
EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE.

744
