MY MOM.

181

I WOULD NEVER HELP HER.

I'M SORRY.

MY MOM AND ME

184

AND THEN GAVE US
ONE DOSE OF THE ANTIDOTE,

00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:12,019
SO...MY MOM DIED
IN MY ARMS.

WHERE I CAN FIND HER,

DIE FOR THIS.

MAYBE, BUT FIRST,
SHE HAS TO SEE ME.

708
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:40,089
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
