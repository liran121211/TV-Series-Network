1
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:09,187
Oh, God.

2
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:19,869
Ohh!

3
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:23,936
Huh!

4
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:29,722
Ohh!

5
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:30,877
Hey!

6
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,386
Ugh! Oof!

7
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:03,732
Batwoman to batcave.

8
00:01:03,816 --> 00:01:06,482
We need medics to the
rooftop lot above Harper's Plaza.

9
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,474
<i>Batwoman to batcave.
Do you copy?</i>

10
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:09,925
<i>I need medics now.</i>

11
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:11,859
<i>Batwoman to batcave!</i>

12
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,714
You never told me
the 911 operator

13
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,984
was a batwoman fangirl.

14
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,320
Dude's gonna live.

15
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,400
I should have told you
not to work tonight.

16
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:43,570
You know, I might just
need a little time.

17
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,750
Of course.

18
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:48,473
Mary and I can
cover bat duties,

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,580
try to I.D.
The stabby chick

20
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:51,861
making lawyer kabobs.

21
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,168
I mean...

22
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:55,301
I need time alone.

23
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:58,920
Copy.

24
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:04,708
You know I'm here
if you need me, right?

27
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:26,603
Special agent
Russell Tavaroff

28
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,321
has just been released
on bond.

29
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:31,259
He'll be a free man
as he awaits trial,

30
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:33,495
accused of falsifying
evidence to justify

31
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:36,585
the shooting
of an unarmed Gotham citizen.

32
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:38,761
The uproar
over crows misconduct

33
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:40,799
has been ignored
by Gotham officials

34
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:42,417
until one hero spoke up,

35
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:45,723
former crows commander
Jacob Kane.

36
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:48,098
Two crows agents shot...

37
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,251
Jacob Kane.
Heh.

38
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:54,244
I expose Kane as the godfather
of a fraudulent security racket,

39
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:56,259
and now these cloying half-wits
in the fake news

40
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,740
are crowning him
a hero.

41
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:00,111
Haven't you
done enough, Roman?

42
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:02,339
You imprisoned
the man's daughter,

43
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:04,173
then brainwashed her
into your own.

44
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:06,082
He murdered my Circe.

45
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,384
So toying with Kane's
daughter is your way

46
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:11,388
of... feeling better
about him killing yours?

47
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:14,063
I apologize,
your royal highness,

48
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:15,852
but when you gave me
the details

49
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:17,759
of Kate Kane's flight
out of national city,

50
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:20,337
you knew exactly what
I had in mind for her.

51
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:23,471
Speaking of you owing
me a favor,

52
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:26,635
I was hoping to employ
your daughter's services

53
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,665
to settle my affairs
in Gotham.

54
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:30,923
I have reason to believe
that Circe's

55
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:33,587
unique attributes could
benefit us both.

56
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,131
Whatever it is,
I don't want her involved.

57
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,829
She's finally got
her life back.

58
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,136
Last I heard, she was
running around

59
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,986
with a tree stapled
to her face.

60
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:43,385
Oh, she's ready to
make her grand reentry

61
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,282
into Gotham's
influencer life.

62
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:47,416
After all, my p.R. Team
covered up the incident

63
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,494
that landed her
in Arkham to begin with

64
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:51,368
and her death,
yada yada.

65
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:54,673
They've put together a
very millennial cover story

66
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:55,876
to explain
her disappearance.

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,156
3 words...

68
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,519
Malibu, rehab, retreat.

69
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:05,706
This is the crown Jewel.

70
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,187
<i>A life
lived but once</i>

71
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:14,600
<i>is a life lived not at all.</i>

72
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,227
<i>The newest line
from janus cosmetics</i>

73
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:20,944
<i>has arrived...</i>

74
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:24,081
Rebirth.

75
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:27,242
It wasn't enough

76
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:29,919
that she believed
she was my Circe.

77
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:32,703
Between the new face
and a strict regimen

78
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:35,145
of janus restorative
burn cream,

79
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:37,343
she now looks like
her, too.

80
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:40,709
I know enigma gave her
Circe's memories,

81
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:43,067
but who
gave her Circe's face?

82
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:44,161
If you can believe it,

83
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:46,473
that rambling
sewer rat Alice.

84
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:50,016
You brought Kate Kane
and Alice together?

85
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:51,815
When was this?

86
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,618
Two days ago. Why?

87
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,705
Alice is Beth Kane,
you idiot.

88
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:12,258
Ugh!

89
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:13,891
You're coming
with us, kiddo.

90
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:17,669
If you're wearing
yoga pants,

91
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:19,429
this is so much worse
than I thought.

92
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:25,372
Now tell me what
I'm walking into.

93
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:29,308
This is a government
safe house.

94
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:38,360
Bidets in the bathroom.

95
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,489
They wouldn't even give us
hand soap

96
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,966
for the community center.

97
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,107
Turns out the lawyer
whose computer was stolen

98
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:47,046
by "kill Bill" superfan
was working with judges

99
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,247
to place people
into witness relocation.

100
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:51,644
And all that top-secret
location information

101
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:53,646
- was on his computer.
- Exactly,

102
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,446
so sword lady's
looking for somebody

103
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,101
in witness relocation,
so I placed a trace

104
00:05:58,185 --> 00:05:59,842
on all of his
outgoing calls,

105
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,018
assuming that he'd reach out
to the witnesses,

106
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:03,263
give them a heads-up.

107
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:04,918
And you figured
all that out?

108
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:06,892
Oh. You know, I may
have outsourced

109
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:08,372
the fancy parts
to Sophie.

110
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:10,766
Anyway, we are starting
with this guy

111
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,725
because the lawyer called
him first, called him a lot,

112
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:16,149
but he never picked up.

113
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:18,204
Starting to know why.

114
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:26,835
Found our Vic.

115
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,451
Same perp left
a sword in him.

116
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,899
Definitely trying
to make a statement.

117
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,891
Oh, man. Poor guy
was blind.

118
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:45,087
This isn't your fight,
batwoman.

119
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,266
Why is that? Because
I can actually fight back?

120
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,607
Tatiana?

121
00:06:56,737 --> 00:06:58,370
Unh!

122
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:09,084
<i>DNA match complete.</i>

123
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:11,167
Heh.

124
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:14,406
My god.

125
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,433
It really is you.

126
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:25,540
You've got me confused
with a dead girl.

127
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:28,509
Alice: No. You've got you
confused with a dead girl.

128
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:31,994
Two dozen inmates used
Circe Sionis as a doormat

129
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:33,933
on their way out
of Arkham.

130
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:42,808
Listen.

131
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:45,318
I know this is a lot
to handle.

132
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:46,910
Oof!

133
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:48,999
Hey!

134
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,127
Sorry, but did you
want her to escape?

135
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,361
How do we get Kate back?

136
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:58,509
There's a secret keyword
to unlock her memories

137
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:01,170
except the woman
who did that to her

138
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:03,173
is dead.

139
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:05,262
The other option is we jog
her memory piece by piece

140
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:06,828
using personal objects.

141
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:10,159
Ocean: That's where
these come in.

142
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:12,337
Everything that's left
of Kate's childhood.

143
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:15,425
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

144
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:18,254
O... cean, meet daddy.

145
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,948
Daddy, meet ocean.

146
00:08:21,727 --> 00:08:23,798
Good to meet you,
Mr. Kane.

147
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,979
Right. What do we
do now?

148
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:28,868
Alice: When enigma locked
me out of my memories,

149
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:31,134
I forced my way back
in with a photograph.

150
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,464
Her work is formidable,

151
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:37,207
but... as soon as the
first crack appears,

152
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,732
she'll go mad wanting to
know the truth about her life.

153
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:42,690
Enigma worked
on you, too?

154
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:44,861
Daddy, you don't get
this extra

155
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:46,520
without
a little shove.

156
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:48,522
I thought the shove
was Cartwright.

157
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:51,525
No. He didn't
fully break me.

158
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:53,049
I was too strong.

159
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,876
I can attest to that.

160
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,357
Alice may have been
angry

161
00:08:57,441 --> 00:09:00,578
and reckless
and ornery,

162
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:04,114
but... she could
still love.

163
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:08,221
What are you saying,
that... Enigma

164
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:10,489
took away your ability
to love?

165
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:14,679
I'll let you
get on with it.

166
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,181
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Kane.

167
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,174
Yeah. This Mr. Kane thing
is definitely weird for me.

168
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:23,838
I want the guy
to like me.

169
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:26,729
Call me old-fashioned.

170
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:28,822
If you told me I'd be
in the crows headquarters

171
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:29,911
with my father,
my sister,

172
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:32,658
and my... Boy toy

173
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:34,688
and I wouldn't be
the one in cuffs...

174
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:37,973
No one ever accused you
of being predictable.

175
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,035
Call you later.

176
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:46,834
Good.

177
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:57,414
Ezra castellanos.
Never heard of him.

178
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:00,377
Probably because up
until a few days ago,

179
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:04,381
he was being protected by crows
security in witness protection.

180
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:06,905
5 years ago, Ezra's eyes

181
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:09,081
were gouged out
with a soup spoon

182
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:12,476
by a woman named
Circe Sionis.

183
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,345
So this case
was sealed,

184
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:17,959
but Luke has
a thingy

185
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:19,831
that unseals seals.

186
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:22,505
- Ok. Then.
- Ha!

187
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:27,752
Circe's the daughter of janus
cosmetics founder Roman Sionis.

188
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,120
Former model claimed
self-defense

189
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:32,104
after Ezra assaulted
her at a party,

190
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:34,627
and after she went
to Arkham,

191
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,512
Ezra was afraid the Sionis
family would come after him,

192
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:38,416
so he went
into WITSEC.

193
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,460
Didn't Alice stop by
the other day

194
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:43,159
asking if someone named
Circe showed up to you?

195
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,565
Yeah, and now I'm
just confused.

196
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,642
Yeah. I'm gonna check
on Luke.

197
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:51,819
Well, we could try
and track him down

198
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:54,794
with his fancy
hacker tools.

199
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:58,481
Assuming you know
which buttons to press.

200
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:02,396
Ok.

201
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,417
Huh?

202
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:14,739
<i>Diamond Dust's "Sising stars"

206
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,861
It's law enforcement
only.

207
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:36,768
They let you in,
and last I checked,

208
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:40,059
your new occupation
is unemployed haircut.

209
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,593
Two whiskeys neat.

210
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:45,307
Look. I understand
the problem here, ok?

211
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:47,658
- Oh.
- Yeah. I'm free on bail,

212
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:49,834
my charges are
gonna be dropped,

213
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,575
and as far as the law
is concerned,

214
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:53,860
well, we're back to
you being a car thief

215
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:55,384

00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:57,887
so...

217
00:11:58,187 --> 00:11:59,583
I'm not throwing
my career away

218
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,672
because your daddy
didn't teach you

219
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:04,196
how to stay out of the
wrong place at the wrong time.

220
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,198
Ooh. See, if I were you,

221
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:08,566
I would not talk
about my father.

222
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:13,249

You come here

225
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,997
You looking for another
fake excuse to shoot me?

226
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:25,588
So how do you propose
we settle this?

227
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:29,688
Now I heard you won the
crows' hold 'em tournament

228
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:32,130
two years in a row.

229
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:36,944
You are a stalker.

230
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:44,642
Really hope you have
a plan, kid.

231
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:49,833
You know, some of us
are just here to play cards.

232
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:04,300
I like punk rock.
How edgy.

233
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,177
You should remember
this bag.

234
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:09,066
I found a joint
in this pocket,

235
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:11,242
grounded you
for the entire summer.

236
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:14,187
Harsh. It wasn't
even coke.

237
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:16,802
You think he would
try memories

238
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:18,518
I would actually
want to remember.

239
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:22,019
You said it ended up being
the best summer you ever had.

240
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,582
I am not Kate Kane,

241
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,758
and even if I was,
what makes you think

242
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:29,455
I would want to come
back to a father

243
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:31,762
who stopped looking
for both daughters

244
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:35,087
and a literal
evil twin, hmm?

245
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:36,630
What am I missing?

246
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:45,877
This.

247
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:48,822
When we were kids,
you had a big crush

248
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:50,875
on Jenny goldberg.

249
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:53,524
You only liked her
because she skateboarded,

250
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:56,809
but you were so excited
because she liked you back

251
00:13:56,893 --> 00:13:58,781
except you weren't
out yet.

252
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:01,357
You wanted to tell me
you were gay,

253
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,270
but you kept
chickening out.

254
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:06,000
You knew I had to be
the first to know,

255
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:09,669
but I was also
the hardest

256
00:14:09,753 --> 00:14:11,981
because I mattered
the most to you,

257
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:15,539
me... Beth...

258
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,169
Your twin who spent
9 months in the womb with you,

259
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:21,559
and you were scared
of pushing me away,

260
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:23,161
so I made you
that stupid mug

261
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:25,406
to say I already knew

262
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:28,281
and I loved you.

263
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:35,826
I'm locked
in a room.

264
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,218
What room?

265
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,328
A... a basement,
a cell.

266
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,106
I... I can smell
formaldehyde.

267
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,765
Cartwright's.

268
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,153
I can't get out.

269
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,387
Why am I here?

270
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,255
Who's there?

271
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,370
Beth?

272
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:00,177
Beth, is that you?

273
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,003
That's the basement
I spent my childhood in.

274
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:07,245
You've been there.

275
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:08,859
Do you remember?

276
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:10,861
It's... it's more
of a feeling.

277
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:15,151
I'm... I'm screaming, but
I can't get your attention.

278
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:17,041
That... that's not
what happened.

279
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,043
Maybe it's a metaphor.

280
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,610
Circe's subconscious
is a cell,

281
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:22,220
and Kate needs me
to free her.

282
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,222
How can you be sure?

283
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:26,983
Because it's all
I ever wanted.

284
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:34,450
Ok. I'm gonna
take your hands,

285
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:38,660
so just, um...
Don't break mine.

286
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,644
Beth?

287
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:50,040
Are you there?

288
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:51,865
Kate, it's me.
I'm here.

289
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,887
I'm not gonna
leave you.

290
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:58,065
I remember now.

291
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:02,246
You found me,

292
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:05,273
but I couldn't
find you.

293
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:06,859
It's ok.

294
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,859
There's still time.

295
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:14,315
Poker? Really?
We need you home.

296
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,795
We think Safiyah's
in Gotham.

297
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,493
Thought you
and Safiyah were good.

298
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,033
We are, but the guys
who her lackey

299
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,034
ran her sword through can't
really say the same thing.

300
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:23,819
Ok. Well, you said
you and Mary got this,

301
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:25,626
and I'm in the middle of
a game right now, so...

302
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,259
Look. We will give you
the space to do your thing,

303
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:30,999
but we need a hand.

304
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,219
In this family, we take care
of each other first, right?

305
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:35,744
Every doctor in that hospital
thought I was gonna die

306
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,774
in that bed,
but you and Mary

307
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:39,777
slipped me the desert Rose,
and I woke right up.

308
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:42,607
Ok. If there was a thank
you somewhere in there, I...

309
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:45,368
I didn't want to
wake up.

310
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,027
How can you say that?

311
00:16:50,755 --> 00:16:53,979
When I was under,
I saw my dad,

312
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:58,723
and, I mean, he was
right there.

313
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,507
Why the hell
would I want to live

314
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:02,814
in a world where we
get shot for no reason,

315
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:04,337
where the gunmen get
out of jail free

316
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:06,165
so it's not
a matter of if

317
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:07,557
there's another
bullet coming,

318
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:09,734
it's when?

319
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:12,071
Why would I go
through it

320
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,528
when I can be
with my dad again?

321
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,407
I got to get back
to my game.

322
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:22,094
What? What do you
mean Kate's alive?

323
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:24,705
She was declared dead.
Julia I.D.

324
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:26,446
Her parietal skull bone.

325
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,186
Her DNA checks out.
I ran her prints myself.

326
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,104
Look. Everything's a little
bit complicated just now.

327
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:33,714
The only thing you
need to know

328
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:35,795
is that Kate is alive
and safe with me at crows,

329
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:37,060
where no one can hurt her.

330
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:39,024
Ok.
I'm on my way.

331
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,607
Just give us a little
bit more time.

332
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:43,061
She's not quite herself.
Someone brainwashed her

333
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,551
into thinking that
she was someone else.

334
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:46,225
- Who?
- Turns out black mask

335
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:48,819
is cosmetics guru
Roman Sionis.

336
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:50,648
He hypnotized Kate
into thinking

337
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:52,646
that she was his
daughter Circe.

338
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,319
Kate is Circe Sionis.

339
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:57,496
Dad, you need to be
careful.

340
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,434
We have reason to believe
that Circe's connected to Safiyah.

341
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:02,110
What? How?

342
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:09,139
Dad?

343
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,635
Daddy?

344
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:16,801
- Run!
- Where?

345
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:19,120
Anywhere. I'll find you.

346
00:18:19,204 --> 00:18:20,775
<i>Err! Ohh!</i>

347
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:22,404
Unh!

348
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:29,147
Ugh!

349
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,050
Miss me?

350
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,212
He was saying
that the DNA checks out,

351
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:41,112
but Kate thinks
she's Circe Sionis,

352
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:42,710
and she's been alive
this entire time,

353
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:44,028
which doesn't actually
make sense

354
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:45,769
because Julia wouldn't
lie to us and say

355
00:18:45,853 --> 00:18:47,640
that she found Kate's skull
because everybody knows

356
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:49,037
that you can't survive
without a skull!

357
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:51,948
- Mary.
- Sorry. Just freaking out

358
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:53,881
- right now.
- Me, too.

359
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,553
Pulling up
to the crows.

360
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:57,520
Luke needs to know
that Kate's alive.

361
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,429
I know we did the right
thing saving his life,

362
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,764
and I knew he'd have a
lot to work through, but...

363
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:05,747
Right now, it feels like
we just added to his pain.

364
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,186
It sucks.

365
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,806
I'm glad to have you
on the comms, batcave.

366
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:21,291
I'll call you back.

367
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:26,978
Are you Kate Kane?

368
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,736
Can I get back
to you on that?

369
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,888
Need a ride?

370
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:43,176
- <i>♪ Outside the castle wall</i>
- Call.

371
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,327
<i>- ♪ The battle call</i>
- Raise.

372
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:51,189
- <i>♪ In the air,</i>
- I'm out.

373
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,010
<i>♪ The reckoning is near ♪</i>

374
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:55,384
Reraise.

375
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:58,669
- <i>- ♪ Until sides are recognized ♪
</i>- Ohh!

376
00:19:58,753 --> 00:19:59,763

377
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:03,446
<i>♪ All they ever gave</i>

378
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:06,023
<i>♪ Two sides to describe...</i>

379
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:08,474
Oh. Sorry.
Do I have you covered?

380
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,092
Yeah. I have a lot
more chips than you.

381
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,536
Uh, look. If you
got me beat

382
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,154
and you want to start
a little collection

383
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:14,927
with your buddies here
so you can match my chips,

384
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:16,720
I'll just hang out.

385
00:20:17,902 --> 00:20:20,776
You want to let me in
on the grudge... with this?

386
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,188
What? Grudge?
This is just a friendly game.

387
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,391
Ok.

388
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:32,553
<i>♪ I know,
I know, I know ♪♪</i>

389
00:20:32,637 --> 00:20:35,404
Why haven't I seen
you around here before?

390
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,474
Name's John Diggle.
I'm from Star City.

391
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:40,905
I'm in town on a contract
with A.R.G.U.S.

392
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,349
Well, hey. Welcome.

393
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:48,274
Please. Allow me to remove
this little... distraction,

394
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,147
who's been playing
with us.

395
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:54,626
Buddy, Gotham city is
our town,

396
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:58,197
and the house
always wins.

397
00:20:58,281 --> 00:21:00,831
<i>♪ Live in this world</i>

398
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:03,173
whoo!

399
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:05,313
I mean, people
do say that.

400
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,889
It's true. The house
does win a lot

401
00:21:08,973 --> 00:21:10,567
because it cheats.

402
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:12,611
<i>♪ And I know,
I know... ♪</i>

403
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:15,725
But then sometimes,
I mean, the house

404
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,954
is just
so damn stupid

405
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,407
that it can cheat

406
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:23,253
and still manage
to lose.

407
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:35,415
Heh. The man made
a straight.

408
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:37,878
What no applause

409
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:40,160
for that... for that
gut-shot straight draw?

410
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:41,945
I mean, and the speech?
No style points for that?

411
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:44,687
Ok. Whatever.

412
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,273
Ahem.

413
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:58,350
I've been running
from this fight my whole life...

414
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,117
And it has gotten me
nowhere.

415
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,328
Hmm. First you're up,
then you're down.

416
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:18,847
I don't know if you're
gonna take any comfort

417
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:20,402
from this, Jake,
but, uh, now,

418
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:21,985
you're down
and out for good.

419
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:23,933
True for both of us,
black mask,

420
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:26,129
unless you think Gotham's
gonna buy its zit cream

421
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:27,512
from a psychotic
gang leader.

422
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,545
Tough call.
It's a good zit cream.

423
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:32,822
On the topic of
hereditary diseases,

424
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:34,432
Gotham is about
to find out

425
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:37,827
that your daughter,
uh, Beth Kane

426
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:40,351
is none other than
the knife-slinging,

427
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:42,919
nursery-rhyme-named
Alice.

428
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:46,531
My people will make sure
gcpd is on your doorstep

429
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,359
before you can clear
this up.

430
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:51,710
Gcpd on my doorstep?
You know what?

431
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:53,538
That's a fantastic idea.

432
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,168
Gentlemen.

433
00:23:02,936 --> 00:23:04,462
If you try to blow
the whistle

434
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:06,420
on the Sionis family,
not only will the public

435
00:23:06,504 --> 00:23:09,032
think you're as crazy
as your daughter,

436
00:23:09,116 --> 00:23:12,707
but the gcpd will, uh,
misplace any evidence

437
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,212
you happen to dig up,
and I will personally make sure

438
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:17,081
that any family
you have left

439
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:19,108
suffers immensely.

440
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,262
Jacob Kane, you're
under arrest

441
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:25,549
for aiding and abetting the
criminal at large known as Alice.

442
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:36,716
Come on. Is this what
you really wanted?

443
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,433
Unh!

444
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,683
I'm taking
my money back.

445
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:02,819
That's enough!

446
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:05,757
Easy, star city.
It's not your fight.

447
00:24:05,868 --> 00:24:07,438
- He won.
- You saw the blatant disrespect

448
00:24:07,522 --> 00:24:08,787
at the table.

449
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,188
In Gotham city,
we hold the line

450
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:11,485
against punks
like this.

451
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:13,855
Ohh! Ergh!

452
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:17,840
I hear you shot him
the other day,

453
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,356
and now you're upset that
he's not showing you respect?

454
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:31,645
Ohh!

455
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,707
Um...

456
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,641
I never thought
I'd see you again.

457
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,508
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

458
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:42,687
I think she's still
trying to figure things out.

459
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:46,216
Oh. Yeah.
Of course. Right.

460
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,869
Just any questions
you have, I'm here

461
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:51,830
or not, you know.

462
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:54,485
I'm not trying
to smother you.

463
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,864
- I need a drink.
- I...

464
00:25:00,053 --> 00:25:01,258
Did you find my dad?

465
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:03,306
No. She said a bunch
of false face goons

466
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,493
raided the joint.

467
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:06,757
Then she described someone
wearing a hair chain

468
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:08,720
and holding two
big-ass swords.

469
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:11,197
- Tatiana.
- She thinks Tatiana

470
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:12,372
wanted Alice.

471
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:13,896
Alice was
at the crows

472
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,415
with... with my dad?

473
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:17,453
Literally, what
is happening?

474
00:25:17,537 --> 00:25:19,213
Kate?

475
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:24,907
Ok. Don't get too excited.

476
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,015
There's still a lot
she doesn't remember.

477
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:30,785
Sophie.

478
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:37,993
Whoa.

479
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:45,103
So Alice just told
you about some mug,

480
00:25:45,187 --> 00:25:46,268
and that was it, really?

481
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:48,618
Alice? Really?

482
00:25:48,702 --> 00:25:52,127
Uhh. Where is
my father?

483
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:55,149
Ok. Let's chill.
Just give her a minute.

484
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:57,021
Hey.
We know it's a lot.

485
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:58,371
Maybe you should
sit down.

486
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:00,480
Yeah.
That sounds good.

487
00:26:02,716 --> 00:26:04,044
Agh!

488
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,770
Beth?

489
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:12,535
Where are you?

490
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,167
Where did you go?

491
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:24,887
I think you've caused
quite enough trouble.

492
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,399
Hey, Kate.
You're good. You're safe, ok?

493
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:31,989
No!

494
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:36,416
Agh!

495
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,000
Ohh!

496
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:42,977
Wow. You just carry
one of those around?

497
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:46,676
Oh, yeah. Syringe
chock full of benzos?

498
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,380
Comes in handy
in Gotham.

499
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:50,919
- Everyone ok?
- Everyone but Kate.

500
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,058
What the hell
happened?

501
00:26:52,142 --> 00:26:55,598
I think Kate and Circe
are duking it out in her head,

502
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,034
and Circe's winning
right now.

503
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,841
So if Alice is
the lynchpin

504
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:00,323
to jogging more
of Kate's memories

505
00:27:00,407 --> 00:27:02,684
- and Safiyah has her...
- no, no, no.

506
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:05,138
Even if I could stomach
the idea

507
00:27:05,222 --> 00:27:07,160
of saving Alice's life
right now,

508
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:09,333
Safiyah came all the way
from Coryana

509
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:11,801
for the pyro who torched
her entire kingdom,

510
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:13,895
so what could we possibly
offer her

511
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,270
that would be better
than that, hmm?

512
00:27:15,354 --> 00:27:17,067
Gotham steakhouse
gift card or...

513
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:19,257
She could rebuild
that kingdom...

514
00:27:20,253 --> 00:27:23,562
If I give her
the desert Rose.

515
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,710
Ryan... no.

516
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:29,585
It's your last
connection to your mom.

517
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,708
You're really willing
to do that?

518
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:34,921
Willing is pushing it.

519
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:38,380
More like we don't have
anything else to bargain with.

520
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:40,774
Even if you're willing
to make the trade,

521
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:42,333
how do we even
find her?

522
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:44,786
Maybe this is a good excuse
to show Luke

523
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,734
just how badly
his friends need him.

524
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,078
Hey. You good?

525
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:55,269
Yeah.

526
00:27:58,612 --> 00:28:01,226
Your old man's
Lucius fox, right?

527
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,052
Put together some details
when you were having

528
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:06,546
that friendly game
of hold 'em. Heh heh heh.

529
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:12,066
You lost your
old man young.

530
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,415
That's... that's
hard, man.

531
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:15,112
That's real hard.

532
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:17,270
My old man was a
marine deployed overseas

533
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:20,296
when I was a boy,
killed in action.

534
00:28:21,964 --> 00:28:24,265
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's all right.

535
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,231
But it left me
with a lot of questions

536
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:29,335
about him and me,

537
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,716
so I get it when those
questions become more important

538
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,114
than anything else
in the world, man.

539
00:28:33,198 --> 00:28:34,255
Believe me, I get it.

540
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:35,418
What you have to
remember is that

541
00:28:35,502 --> 00:28:38,054
we all end up in the same
place eventually, man,

542
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:42,656
and you'll see
your father soon enough.

543
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:45,763
What changes with time is
what you get to tell him

544
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:47,020
you did while you were
on the earth.

545
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:51,013
Ok. So... I'm just
supposed to ignore the fact

546
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:52,145
that I'm still
angry as hell?

547
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:54,261
No, brother.
Don't ignore it. Use it.

548
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:57,304
You carry the torch
for the great fox family.

549
00:28:57,393 --> 00:28:59,778
<i>You</i>
stand for justice.

550
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:02,101
You're gonna need anger
to win that fight.

551
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:10,059
- You ok?
- Yeah. Yeah.

552
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:12,669
Just some, um,
fogginess, dizziness.

553
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:14,666
Something's not right.

554
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,257
Lifetime of anger has its side
effects, you know what I mean?

555
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:19,708
You know we have a
world-renowned neurology department

556
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,466
at Gotham general?

557
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,876
I can get you
a connect if you want.

558
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,098
That's actually
why I'm here.

559
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:25,989
Have an appointment
in the morning.

560
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,070
Is it supposed
to do that?

561
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:39,070
No. That's
highly unusual.

562
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,230
In fact, I think
it's...

563
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:41,764
It's morse code.

564
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:43,963
- Need...
- Fox...

565
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,715
Help.

566
00:29:49,424 --> 00:29:51,452
I should go.

567
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:53,453
You know, you seem
pretty important for a man

568
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:55,690
who's trying to get his
ass kicked in an alley.

569
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:58,354
Good thing
you're alive.

570
00:29:58,694 --> 00:30:00,150
Thanks.

571
00:30:02,942 --> 00:30:04,726
Take care of yourself,
Luke fox.

572
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,257
<i>Hello. This is
Dana DeWitt,</i>

573
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:08,774
<i>and I'm coming to you live
from grand street downtown</i>

574
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:10,946
<i>outside of gcpd headquarters.</i>

575
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,709
<i>Earlier today, we got word
of the shocking arrest</i>

576
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:15,450
<i>of former crows commander
Jacob Kane,</i>

577
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:18,552
<i>who is rumored to be...
There he is.</i>

578
00:30:18,636 --> 00:30:20,442
<i>Mr. Kane, is it true
you're the father</i>

579
00:30:20,526 --> 00:30:23,015
<i>of one of Gotham's
most notorious monsters?</i>

580
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,183
<i>It's not like
that, Dana.</i>

581
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:36,052
<i>Yes, she's my daughter,
and her name is Beth.</i>

582
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:38,191
<i>She's not a monster.</i>

583
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:40,848
<i>She's a victim
of evil men and women</i>

584
00:30:40,932 --> 00:30:43,681
<i>who stole her childhood
and manipulated her mind,</i>

585
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:46,742
<i>of a father who... who
didn't come through for her</i>

586
00:30:46,826 --> 00:30:48,309
<i>when she needed him.</i>

587
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:50,913
<i>Beth has had
the hardest life</i>

588
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:52,280
<i>of anyone
I've ever known,</i>

589
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:57,045
<i>and yet... She has
this humanity inside of her.</i>

590
00:30:57,129 --> 00:30:59,450
<i>I can't imagine
ever having that strength,</i>

591
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:03,454
<i>so if Gotham is angry
at me, then so be it.</i>

592
00:31:03,801 --> 00:31:06,588
<i>I ask only this of them
as a father.</i>

593
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:09,712
<i>When you judge Alice
for her crimes,</i>

594
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:12,446
<i>remember Beth.</i>

595
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:19,489
She's in here,
my queen.

596
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:23,314
My dear...

597
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:26,392
I believe you owe
me an island.

598
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,950
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ugh! Ow!

599
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:34,178
Ooh. This is deep.

600
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:35,991
How many times
you get hit?

601
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,805
You should've
saw him, ok?

602
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:40,827
Didn't realize poker
was a contact sport.

603
00:31:43,974 --> 00:31:45,675
Wasn't there
an emergency?

604
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:48,612
Safiyah's holding Alice
somewhere in Gotham,

605
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:51,047
so we need your
brilliant decoder brain

606
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:53,166
to figure out
how to find her...

607
00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:55,198
And save her.

608
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,410
Ok. I give up.

609
00:31:57,677 --> 00:31:59,745
What are you
not telling me?

610
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:09,847
Kate's still alive.

611
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,515
There's nothing left
of Coryana.

612
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:25,784
Your scorching
was thorough and complete.

613
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:28,369
9 villagers perished
in the Blaze,

614
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:30,516
so if you have managed
to maintain a list

615
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,852
after all these years,
do include them

616
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:34,366
in your grand total.

617
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,348
You told me you had
my sister.

618
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,010
What did you expect?

619
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:41,893
If I'm honest,
that,

620
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:43,841
a tantrum

621
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:45,594
because at the end
of the day, Alice,

622
00:32:45,678 --> 00:32:46,968
you're just
a spoiled child

623
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:49,870
who believes she deserves
more than she's earned.

624
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:53,503
What is this?

625
00:32:53,587 --> 00:32:55,993
Chill. I come in peace.

626
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:57,437
Let her in.

627
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,748
What are you
doing here?

628
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:07,604
I've had this plant
a long time.

629
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,653
I didn't even know what
it was or what it could do

630
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,210
until recently,
but even before I knew,

631
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,208
it was my favorite
thing in the whole world.

632
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,600
And why is that?

633
00:33:15,684 --> 00:33:18,156
A woman I counted
as my mother,

634
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:20,430
she died a while back,
and this plant was

635
00:33:20,514 --> 00:33:22,638
my last connection
to her.

636
00:33:23,472 --> 00:33:25,500
And yet you brought it
to offer

637
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,255
in what I presume
is a trade for Alice?

638
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:32,989
Your enemy.

639
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:35,501
Alice is the key
to getting

640
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:37,176
her sister's
memories back.

641
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,875
The choice is easy.
Revenge is short-lived,

642
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,182
but rebuilding
your island,

643
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:43,153
it's a no-brainer.

644
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:46,502
What I don't understand
is what's in this for you.

645
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:48,706
I see someone giving up
her most valued possession

646
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,439
to save a woman she hates

647
00:33:50,523 --> 00:33:52,246
to unlock the memories
of another woman

648
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,557
she doesn't even know.

649
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:56,944
It's either remarkable
or remarkably stupid.

650
00:33:57,056 --> 00:33:59,253
I know what Kate Kane
stands for,

651
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:03,257
and I owe a debt to
the symbol she created.

652
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,608
Found my second chance
at a life because of her.

653
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:11,047
I've never met her,
but... I believe

654
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:12,750
you'd make
Kate Kane proud.

655
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,931
I accept your offer.

656
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:26,741
If I can't have you,

657
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:29,919
at least I can
have my kingdom.

658
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:32,985
Thank you...
My queen.

659
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:38,999
I'll make sure to tell
ocean you send your regards.

660
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,172
Alice, let's go.

661
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:48,652
It's funny.

662
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:51,047
Here you are
a literal queen,

663
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:55,465
and yet I have my
boyfriend and my sister,

664
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:58,181
and all you have
is a little flower.

665
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,879
Oh, there you go
again,

666
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:02,375
believing you deserve more
than you've earned.

667
00:35:06,912 --> 00:35:08,458
What did you do?

668
00:35:11,238 --> 00:35:12,809
Where's Tatiana?

669
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:15,639
Don't play dumb, Alice.

670
00:35:15,723 --> 00:35:19,942
You always knew deep down
a girl like you

671
00:35:20,026 --> 00:35:23,182
could never be worthy
of having it all.

672
00:35:34,844 --> 00:35:37,307
Hey. Easy.

673
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:40,448
We brought you to a place we
thought you'd be more comfortable.

674
00:35:41,064 --> 00:35:42,976
You kind of lashed out
at Mary.

675
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,001
I did? Is she ok?

676
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:47,737
She's fine.

677
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:51,495
She's worried about you.

678
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:02,487
Who am I?

679
00:36:02,692 --> 00:36:04,263
Whose face is this?

680
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:05,830
We'll get to that.

681
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,735
Do you remember anything
you've been put through

682
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:09,493
all these months?

683
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:14,276
- Why are you here?
- Because you don't seem

684
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,135
to want to stay
in there like a good girl,

685
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:20,505
so now we're gonna have
to do things the messy way.

686
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:23,832
Hey.
Are you ok?

687
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,838
Can I get you a glass
of water or something?

688
00:36:26,922 --> 00:36:29,264
I'm gonna need something
stronger than that.

689
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:35,162
There's an amazing
bottle of tasteless vodka

690
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:37,933
in my office desk,
bottom drawer.

691
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:39,614
Would you mind?

692
00:36:40,203 --> 00:36:43,359
- I'll go check.
- Thank you.

693
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,212
Ocean isn't answering
his phone.

694
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,228
I don't care.

695
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,231
You heard
what Safiyah said.

696
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,954
And I didn't give up
my plant

697
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:01,000
so you could run off
to your boyfriend.

698
00:37:01,084 --> 00:37:03,786
- Get in the car!
- Or what?

699
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,706
You'll kill me,
drag against my will?

700
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:11,140
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
You need me alive and cooperative.

701
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:14,716
I don't need you.
Your sister needs you.

702
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:19,148
If she really is back
to being Kate Kane,

703
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:23,432
then my disappointing her
will come as no surprise.

704
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,568
Ocean?
Ocean?

705
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:40,055
Oh.

706
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:42,103
So Safiyah took
her little magic knife

707
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:44,939
out of you so you could
stick it in me.

708
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:49,157
That's sweet.
You can keep it.

709
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:59,817
Oops.
This isn't the magic one.

710
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,270
Ocean?

711
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,512
No. No, no, no, no.

712
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,232
No, no, no, no.

713
00:38:20,316 --> 00:38:23,048
No, no.

714
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,101
You're safe?
How is that even possible?

715
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:39,725
Blackgate's worst offenders
are all people that you put there.

716
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:41,635
Judge granted
my petition

717
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,654
for change of venue.

718
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:45,682
I'm... being transferred
to Metropolis.

719
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:49,207
<i>Ok. That's a start.
I'll start making calls,</i>

720
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:50,861
<i>line up character
witnesses, and...</i>

721
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:52,515
<i>Mary, we're not gonna
beat these charges,</i>

722
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,996
<i>not with Roman Sionis
pulling the strings</i>

723
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,215
and Alice's reputation
hanging over me.

724
00:38:57,299 --> 00:38:59,392
She earned that reputation,
not you,

725
00:38:59,476 --> 00:39:00,986
so you don't deserve
to take the fall

726
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,617
for the things that
she did.

727
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:05,222
<i>Mary, I want you to
promise me something.</i>

728
00:39:05,306 --> 00:39:08,059
Seeing Kate and Alice
together gave me hope.

729
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:10,383
When I saw how Kate
was buried

730
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:13,626
under this grotesque
stranger named Circe,

731
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:17,782
I understood the same thing
must have happened to... to Beth.

732
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:19,243
If Circe and Alice
go away,

733
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:20,735
we can get Kate
and Beth back.

734
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,633
There's only one person
who can make that happen.

735
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:23,940
Dad...

736
00:39:24,024 --> 00:39:26,051
I understood she
took a lot from you,

737
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:27,391
took a lot
from all of us,

738
00:39:27,475 --> 00:39:29,857
but... I just wish you
could have seen Beth

739
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:31,723
before the accident.

740
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:34,863
Hoping one day
you get the chance to.

741
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:36,559
That's why I'm counting
on you to save

742
00:39:36,643 --> 00:39:37,836
both your sisters.

743
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,317
No pressure!

744
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:41,216
Never had to worry
about you before.

745
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,953
Not gonna start now.

746
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:45,282
I love you, Mary.

747
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,175
I love you, too.

748
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,674
Remind me to never
do a serial killer a favor again.

749
00:39:58,758 --> 00:40:00,453
I'm sorry
you lost your plant.

750
00:40:00,537 --> 00:40:01,706
I know it meant
a lot to you,

751
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,274
seeing as I
babysat it.

752
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:05,687
Ok. The plant does not
matter to me right now.

753
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:08,651
I know you want
to see Kate,

754
00:40:08,735 --> 00:40:10,358
but I got something
to say.

755
00:40:10,663 --> 00:40:13,061
I am so sorry
for what happened to you.

756
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,142
I have no idea what it's
like to walk in your shoes,

757
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:17,764
but let me make
something very clear.

758
00:40:18,347 --> 00:40:21,136
I am not sorry
I made sure you lived,

759
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,461
so screw your choice.

760
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,965
You're not leaving me.

761
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,039
Hey. Did you see Kate
down there?

762
00:40:38,123 --> 00:40:40,793
No. We thought
she was up here.

763
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,329
I left for two seconds
to get her something,

764
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:46,058
and when I came back,
she was gone.

765
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:53,489
When did you get in?
I've been calling everybody,

766
00:40:53,573 --> 00:40:55,289
looking for you.

767
00:40:56,549 --> 00:40:59,086
Am I Kate Kane?

768
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,646
Kate Kane? Who? No.
No, no, sweetheart.

769
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,320
You're my baby girl.

770
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:07,679
Why am I having
her memories?

771
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:11,611
Why do I have
her fingerprints,

772
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:13,961
and why do I know
where she keeps

773
00:41:14,045 --> 00:41:16,311
her fricking alcohol
in her office?

774
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:18,351
You're having an episode.

775
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:20,871
Let's practice
our grounding techniques.

776
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:23,242
Agh!

777
00:41:24,302 --> 00:41:25,916
Tell me
what's happening.

778
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,929
You're having an episode,
sweetheart. Please.

779
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:32,152
Tell her, Roman,
or I will.

780
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:34,341
I've always held the belief
that a woman

781
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,942
has a right to decide

782
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,661
exactly who
she wants to be.
