00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,559
Ryan's only hope
is the desert Rose,

3
00:00:03,644 --> 00:00:05,056
<i>which is on Coryana
with Kate.</i>

4
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:06,830
- Who's Safiyah?
- The woman who has my daughter.

5
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:08,411
We can't locate her,
but since this was

6
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,473
the last thing on Kate's phone,
we think it will help.

7
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:11,830
The many arms
will kill whoever

8
00:00:11,914 --> 00:00:13,194
lays hands
on that painting.

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,895
You'll never find
Coryana.

10
00:00:15,026 --> 00:00:17,797
The painting gets us to Coryana?
Is it a map?

11
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:28,635
Aah! It feels like
my brain is hemorrhaging.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,240
It's even nastier
since yesterday.

13
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:32,004
It kind of reeks, too.
It kind of...

14
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:33,768
Thanks, Luke!
Very helpful!

15
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:35,563
Ok. Remember
a few days ago

16
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:37,982
when I deleted half the dvr
to make room for your shows?

17
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,704
- What?
- Just remember you like me, ok?

18
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,561
- What the hell just happened?
- I am trying really hard

19
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:01,448
not to seriously
freak out right now,

20
00:01:01,553 --> 00:01:02,874
but I'm pretty sure
the kryptonite

21
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,708
just entered her brain.

25
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:16,545
I not only
have to fly to Gotham,

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,513
but then you make me
Wade through a mile

27
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:20,516
of rabid rats
to find you?

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,182
It's a wee bit remote,

29
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:24,598
but these types of places
kind of have to be.

30
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:29,473
This was ocean's smoke-out,
wu-wu meditation spot.

31
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:31,221
Was?

32
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:34,720
As promised,
Tatiana.

33
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:38,758
I think you'll find
the ocean is dead calm.

34
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,488
Got to admit I didn't
think you had it in you.

35
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:43,907
Unh!

36
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:48,004
You really shouldn't
be thinking at all, Tatiana.

37
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:50,868
It's not your strong suit.

38
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:52,898
I never would have
traded that map for Alice

39
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,989
if I'd known I'd be forced
to hand it right back over

40
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,228
to a bunch of thugs.

41
00:01:56,313 --> 00:01:58,109
Some highly paid thugs
it turns out.

42
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:01,971
Aaron helzinger wanted the desert
Rose to heal his damaged amygdala.

43
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,455
He also claimed that
Hamilton doctors

44
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:04,921
had been experimenting
on his brain.

45
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:07,042
We can assume
those same doctors

46
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,828
were the ones who sent him to
Mary and me for more antidote.

47
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:11,567
These are all
the doctors he's seen?

48
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:14,205
Yeah. Most of them work for
upstanding regional hospitals

49
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,408
except one...
Dr. Ethan Rogers.

50
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:19,782
Rogers was Helzinger's last
known neurologist, worked in a lab.

51
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,311
Appears to have been running
off-the-grid medical experiments.

52
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:24,396
You think Rogers was
responsible for taking the map?

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,010
We found that
garnick logistics was owned

54
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:29,169
by an offshore company held
by Hamilton dynamics.

55
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:31,196
It appears we have
unearthed yet another

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,429
of Catherine's
dirty, little secrets.

57
00:02:34,014 --> 00:02:37,237
- Let's go get that map, sir.
- Let's go get that map.

58
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:39,578
Good morning,
my little lesbian pet.

59
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:45,702
What is this?

60
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:48,573
Oh, this? Yeah.
This is storytime.

61
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:52,171
See, you are going to take
me down memoryless Lane,

62
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,253
tell me the who, what,
where, and why

63
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:57,429
ocean and I were
experiencing fleeting moments

64
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:58,867
of forgotten memory.

65
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:01,784
Does it really matter?
He's dead.

66
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:04,124
Yeah. Well, I think you'll
find you have that in common

67
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:05,819
if you don't start
talking!

68
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:07,778
Thought you'd figured it
out by now.

69
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:11,411
Safiyah had
your memories wiped.

70
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,605
I know, but Safiyah
rules over an island.

71
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:17,721
I was an orphan
runaway.

72
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,367
What was so threatening
about little old me?

73
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:23,707
To understand what made
you a threat,

74
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,077
you have to understand
what made you appealing.

75
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:31,110
You and Safiyah had
a common enemy.

76
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:34,560
Catherine Hamilton?
I remember.

77
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:36,832
After Catherine
burned Safiyah

78
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,423
on an island
defense system,

79
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:42,355
Safiyah instructed us
to steal one of her yachts

80
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,079
to teach her a lesson.

81
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:48,160
Turns out vengeful minds
think alike

82
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:51,335
because we found you
stowed away in the cabin,

83
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,540
wearing her clothes, swilling
her 5-figure bottles of champagne.

84
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:02,794
Why the hell
am I here?

85
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,880
Can I kill
her now?

86
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,655
Leave us, please.

87
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:12,683
She's a filthy
outsider.

88
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:14,540
- We have no use for her.
- She is my prisoner.

89
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:16,552
I will deal with her
my way.

90
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,377
You fought off 4
of my men

91
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:20,663
before we put you down.

92
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:23,539
To me, you were
a feral animal,

93
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:26,747
but to Safiyah,
you were something else.

94
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:29,504
You were special.

95
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,958
Relax. I'm not
going to hurt you,

96
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:38,944
and from the looks of
what you did to my men,

97
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:41,176
I wouldn't stand
a chance.

98
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,369
Why am I here?

99
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:45,295
What do you want?

100
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,565
First, I'd like to know why
a beautiful young woman

101
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,531
with her entire life
ahead of her

102
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:52,529
was found sequestered
away on a boat

103
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:54,446
floating in the middle
of nowhere.

104
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:58,153
Let's just say I've grown
accustomed to small spaces.

105
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,501
The real world can be an
overwhelming place sometimes.

106
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:04,623
I understand we both
have a bone to pick

107
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,830
with Catherine
Hamilton-Kane.

108
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:11,575
She convinced
my entire family

109
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,043
I was dead while I spent
the last 11 years

110
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,501
in my kidnapper's
basement cell.

111
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:22,968
And here you are,

112
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:26,421
a siren once trapped
in a net,

113
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:29,395
who somehow
found her way out.

114
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:34,390
Safiyah liked you
because she was inspired by you.

115
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:36,814
Whatever story you told her
of your captivity,

116
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:39,685
you did the one thing
she never could...

117
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:44,196
Escape. She would never
admit it,

118
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:48,529
but to this day, she considers
herself a prisoner of Coryana.

119
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,405
Oh. Poor thing.

120
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:53,144
It must be so hard
being handed a kingdom,

121
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,954
but I remember
all of this.

122
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,614
When did ocean
factor in?

123
00:05:56,707 --> 00:06:00,798
When Safiyah realized
you had purpose.

124
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:02,929
Technically,
you were our prisoner,

125
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:06,478
but she wanted to harness
the rage you had for Catherine

126
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:09,015
by making you one
of her loyal soldiers

127
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,223
except you were
an untamed and angry girl.

128
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:17,339
You needed discipline.

129
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:24,167
And Safiyah knew exactly
who would teach you

130
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,023
how to be a good,
little soldier.

131
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:32,296
Ocean.

132
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,110
Hi.

133
00:06:37,712 --> 00:06:40,582
There are
very few rules on our island...

134
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:45,038
No leaving, no stealing
the desert Rose,

135
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:49,902
and if Safiyah wants
something, she gets it,

136
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:52,615
and Safiyah wanted
your loyalty

137
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,907
so that after you went home
to Gotham

138
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:56,991
to get revenge
against your family

139
00:06:57,076 --> 00:07:00,252
you would come back
and join hers.

140
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,234
And what did I want?

141
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:06,088
You wanted ocean.

142
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:17,140
Hey. Come here.

143
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:19,017
Sophie thinks they might
know who took the map.

144
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:20,899
They're bringing an
army of crows to his work.

145
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,274
So what happens next?
Does Ryan suit up

146
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,518
and jump on the jet
with them?

147
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:25,110
No. She's never
gonna make it.

148
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,735
She has acute radiation.

149
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,569
Her bone marrow
is disintegrating.

150
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:30,479
Her circulatory system
is failing.

151
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,479
Ok. So what do you
suggest?

152
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:34,004
I think we need to ask
my dad to bring

153
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,769
a flower back
with Kate.

154
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:38,102
If he finds the map
and if he gets there in time,

155
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:40,338
not to mention, Mary, that the
man just shut down your clinic.

156
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:41,571
- I know.
- How do you think he'll react to

157
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:42,561
finding out that you're
on the bat team?

158
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:45,674
I'm still in
the brainstorming phase.

159
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,012
Oh!

160
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:50,699
Ryan!

161
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,096
So you're telling me
that...

162
00:08:04,078 --> 00:08:07,294
A little crush
on the first cute boy

163
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:09,441
I laid eyes on
after escaping captivity

164
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:10,937
for 11 years

165
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:14,370
threw the island queen
into a tizzy?

166
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:15,962
It wasn't like that.

167
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,947
In fact, at first,
no one even noticed.

168
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,555
Let me guess-

169
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,177
clandestine trysts
by the water well?

170
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,487
No.

171
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:28,929
The reason
no one noticed

172
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:31,605
was because you two
hated each other.

173
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:34,726
Unh!

174
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,505
Now use my weight
against me.

175
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:40,011
Unh!

176
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:44,920
 Aah! Ohh!

177
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:50,806
The game
is never over.

178
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:52,098
What's the point
of this?

179
00:08:52,182 --> 00:08:54,098
Has anyone ever heard
of a gun?

180
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:56,389
Guns can jam,
get taken.

181
00:08:56,473 --> 00:08:57,805
The real fight
is in here,

182
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,221
and that they can't
take away.

183
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:03,678
Preparation, engagement,
commitment.

184
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:06,386
Surrendering to false gods
and ideologies.

185
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,886
What's that
supposed to mean?

186
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,467
It means there is
a whole world

187
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,946
outside the island that
you know nothing about...

188
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,701
Books, food, electricity...

189
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:19,026
And Safiyah likes to
keep it that way

190
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:23,364
so that you stay close
and loyal and uninspired.

191
00:09:26,388 --> 00:09:27,780
Unh!

192
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,514
As the weeks passed,

193
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:40,349
you two became
each other's sparring partners.

194
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:57,849
I think Safiyah
will like you.

195
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,385
This is a waste
of time.

196
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,282
You're not even
trying.

197
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:05,201
You're wasting
your own time.

198
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:06,425
Well, if it's all
the same to you,

199
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:08,147
I'd rather waste my time
and go get drunk.

200
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,676
W-What do you really want?

201
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:12,592
Revenge?
Why?

202
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,063
Because your family moved
on after more than a decade?

203
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,894
Catherine Hamilton lied
through her teeth

204
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:19,166
so they would
forget me.

205
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,054
Or maybe she did them
a favor.

206
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:22,357
You said they looked
for a year.

207
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:24,544
You weren't gonna be found.
What were they supposed to do,

208
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:26,353
sit around and be miserable
for the next decade?

209
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:27,787
Is that really
what you wanted,

210
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:31,619
the family you supposedly
love and miss so much?

211
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:34,025
You don't need to learn
how to fight, Alice.

212
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:35,986
You need to learn
how to feel.

213
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:54,658
Baby...

214
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:58,600
Are you sure you want to
be going where you're going?

215
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,017
 You know
I have faith

216
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,475
in your
decision-making.

217
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,307
All I'm cautioning
is be mindful

218
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:06,807
the company you keep.

219
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:09,115
Other people judge
your friends.

220
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:12,361
Mama... angelique is
a good person.

221
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,251
Mm-hmm. She also
gets in trouble,

222
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:16,754
and I don't want you
getting roped into her drama.

223
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:19,175
You were put
on this earth

224
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,936
for bigger and better
things, child.

225
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:26,070
I know.
You tell me this every day. Ha!

226
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,049
Mama?

227
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:34,785
What the?

228
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:37,267
What happened?

229
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:38,950
Why'd you stop?

230
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,519
Mama.

231
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:46,169
Mama, what happened?

232
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,344
Batwoman,
do you copy? Batwoman!

233
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:54,375
She just hit
92 miles per hour,

234
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,434
and she's not answering
her comms.

235
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,768
Where the hell
is she going?

236
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:57,845
She's headed
towards the west end.

237
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,054
What the hell's up there?

238
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,800
- Oh, no.
- What?

239
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:02,040
Of course that's
where she went.

240
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:03,251
Where?
Where's she going?

241
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,889
Her brain isn't
working,

242
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,120
- so she turned to her heart.
- What?

243
00:12:09,865 --> 00:12:11,322
Oh, my god!

244
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:16,410
What he actual hell?

245
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:18,576
Angie. Angelique.

246
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:20,502
How do you know
my name?

247
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:22,793
And are... are you ok?

248
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,252
I...

249
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:27,234
Hey. Where's
your wine opener?

250
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:28,741
Oh, my god!

251
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:30,264
- She doesn't drink.
- I don't drink.

252
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:35,163
I'm sorry. How do you
know my life?

253
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:36,871
Angie, what is
going on?

254
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,163
- Angie.
- Shouldn't you be out,

255
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:41,826
like, fighting crime?

256
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:45,321
I'm looking
for your friend...

257
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:47,538
Ocean.

258
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:50,631
Can I have two seconds?

259
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,163
Ok.

260
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:54,754
Ahem. Sorry.

261
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,505
No idea, uh, who you're
talking about.

262
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:00,590
Maybe you know
what this is.

263
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:05,298
Whoa. What are you
gonna do, slash me?

264
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:09,019
Look. The dude grows shrooms
in a concrete jungle.

265
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:12,427
If you can't find him, maybe
you shouldn't quit your day job.

266
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:15,844
Or I'll haul your ass
into the cops,

267
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:18,403
and I'll let them
sweat it out of you.

268
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:21,182
All right. Fine.
You got me.

269
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:24,013
You'll find him
in coventry.

270
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:25,706
I'll give you
a head start.

271
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:27,170
Aah!

272
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:52,315
Grab her legs.

273
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,451
<i>This is the
Gotham city police department.</i>

274
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:56,591
<i>Stop and back away
from the suspect.</i>

275
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:58,838
<i>I repeat.
Back away from the suspect.</i>

276
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,287
<i>You are interfering
in a police response.</i>

277
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:04,229
<i>Freeze. You are under arrest
and ordered not to move.</i>

278
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:06,008
<i>Repeat. You are under arrest...</i>

279
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:07,278
I'll meet you
in the batcave.

280
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:09,296
- Why are you giving me the keys?
- I have to take the Batmobile.

281
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,336
- I can take the Batmobile.
- You've never driven it before.

282
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:13,368
- I've never driven your car before.
- Mary, no!

283
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,257
- Yes!
- No!

284
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:15,130
- Yes!
- Mary!

285
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:16,503
- Yes!
- <i>Release the suspect.</i>

286
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:19,586
<i>- We don't have time for this.</i>
- Give me, give me!

287
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,686
<i>You are under arrest
and ordered...</i>

288
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,270
Hell, yeah!

289
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,013
Mama?

290
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:45,895
Mama!

291
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:09,921
Why are you here?

292
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:12,204
Why did you do this
to us?

293
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:14,300
You must be mad,

294
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,738
or you wouldn't have
come here.

295
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:28,043
Why did you kill her?
What was the point?

296
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:30,247
Huh!

297
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:44,092
You know how much pain
you caused me?

298
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:46,394
How do you do that?

299
00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:48,564
How do you just murder
someone's mom

300
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,513
and move on like
it doesn't matter?

301
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,971
Ha ha ha!

302
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,265
Huh!

303
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:03,030
Tell me you remember her!
Tell me her name!

304
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,263
Cora. Cora Lewis.

305
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:11,213
What are you doing?

306
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:13,302
I'm getting the justice...

307
00:16:13,387 --> 00:16:14,537
Aah!

308
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:16,580
My mother deserves.

309
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:19,955
Aah!

310
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,494
Aah!

311
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:34,811
Ok. Ok. So I hid
the Batmobile keys in dino,

312
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:36,181
and I'm putting
an extra tracker

313
00:16:36,265 --> 00:16:38,406
in her gauntlet cuffs in case
she decides to run off again

314
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,030
and thinks to turn off
her GPS.

315
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:41,685
- What are you doing?
- I'm mixing two

316
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,530
complementary
cardiotonics

317
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:45,511
to calm down her mind
and speed up her system

318
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:48,384
and hopefully pull her
out of these hallucinations,

319
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:52,121
but... this isn't
gonna last,

320
00:16:52,206 --> 00:16:54,828
and since I don't have
access to my clinic anymore,

321
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,113
I'm gonna need
a few supplies.

322
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,609
Ok. Great. Do I look
like postmates, or...

323
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:02,870
No, nor do you
look like a doctor,

324
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,544
which is who needs to
stay with her right now,

325
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:05,977
unless you want to
give it a shot,

326
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:08,179
you know, put her life in
your hands just for funsies?

327
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:10,018
Ok. I'll be back.

328
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:17,789
Hmm?

329
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:21,171
Ah, ah, ah.

330
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:25,546
Save some
for the fishies.

331
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:29,629
So Safiyah and I
shared a common enemy,

332
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:32,253
she thought I'd be
a good soldier,

333
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:36,214
and I started to hate-crush
her metaphorical brother.

334
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,623
Call me old-fashioned, but I'm
missing the motive for a lobotomy.

335
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:42,636
You're really not
getting it, are you?

336
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:44,374
Well, you're not exactly
unfolding the plot

337
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,981
to a shakespearian
drama here.

338
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,607
Safiyah would claim she
wanted you for her army,

339
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:52,121
survival instincts
would make you

340
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:55,329
an excellent fighter
and advisor.

341
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:58,090
And what would you
claim?

342
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:00,175
That she was
in love with you.

343
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,710
I heard there was wine.

344
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,491
Sounds like training's
going well.

345
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:11,949
I have yet to see
the point of an army.

346
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:13,116
You have no crime here,

347
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,351
everyone walks around
with a smile.

348
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:16,106
I'm in Roman pleasantville.

349
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:19,204
That's actually why
I invited you here,

350
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,191
to tell you
about the desert Rose.

351
00:18:24,415 --> 00:18:26,360
It's delicate and vibrant

352
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:29,838
and in the wrong hands one of the
most dangerous weapons in the world.

353
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,375
This?

354
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,782
Its serum can cure illness,
hereditary disease.

355
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:37,913
It can expunge toxins,
pathogens.

356
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:42,232
This simple flower
is a miracle cure-all, Alice,

357
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:45,473
and it's my birthright
to protect it at all costs.

358
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:48,396
- Hence the army.
- Hence the army.

359
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:52,310
On occasion, word of a mystical
flower on a faraway island

360
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:54,282
draws unwanted attention.

361
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,685
If outsiders were able
to come take it,

362
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,393
we'd be left with nothing,

363
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:01,267
and our sanctuary
would be destroyed.

364
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:02,934
Why don't you just
grow more?

365
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,100
According to the lore,
centuries ago,

366
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:07,307
the women of a village
in Europe

367
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,398
banded together to escape
their abusive husbands.

368
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,722
They'd heard tell
of an island

369
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:16,013
under the constellations
of cassiopeia and Andromeda,

370
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:19,387
and they fled here
with their children in tow.

371
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:23,264
Months later, the men
they escaped tracked them down.

372
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:26,596
As their ships landed,
the men were met

373
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,884
by a ferocious
female army.

374
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,841
The women succeeded in
driving the men back into the sea.

375
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:34,507
However, it was
at great cost.

376
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,881
Many women lay dead,
slaughtered.

377
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:40,741
Only my ancestors
and a few others survived.

378
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:44,046
The next day, a field
of roses bloomed

379
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,944
in the very spot
of the battle.

380
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:50,876
The women claimed the
blood that had been spilled

381
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:52,351
was sacred,

382
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:56,268
its protective feminine
essence enriched the land.

383
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,703
They wrote that only
a woman's life force

384
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:05,958
could birth this medicine

385
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:09,085
destined to save mankind.

386
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:19,776
Heh heh.

387
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:21,805
She knew she
couldn't tell you how she felt,

388
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,181
so she showed you.

389
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:24,639
She entrusted you

390
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,199
with her most
valued secret.

391
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:31,118
And someone was
a little jealous?

392
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:33,350
Ha ha ha!

393
00:20:34,072 --> 00:20:37,154
You weren't a threat
to me, Alice.

394
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:41,042
You were a threat to the
entire island of Coryana.

395
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:47,316
Not even, like, a teeny,
weeny, itty, bitty bit jealous?

396
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:49,608
I'm Safiyah's
right hand.

397
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,397
It's my job
to tell her

398
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:53,832
when there's a fox
in the henhouse.

399
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,369
So you think I'm a fox?

400
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:57,531
I think you're
a distraction.

401
00:20:57,616 --> 00:20:59,425
I think you're in love
with her.

402
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:00,962
You are such a child.

403
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:02,703
Well, you're the one who can't
admit you're in love with her.

404
00:21:02,787 --> 00:21:05,043
- Of course, I'm in love with her.
- Ha ha ha!

405
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:06,868
And you'd better believe

406
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:08,687
that when the first
opportunity arose

407
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:14,117
for me to destroy you
I did not hesitate.

408
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:20,725
Let's go, let's go!

409
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:28,667
Got to wonder if Catherine
ever wandered these halls.

410
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,253
Guess there's a lot
you didn't know about her.

411
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:32,195
Well, apparently,
it runs in the family.

412
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,779
Turns out Mary was operating
an illegal medical clinic

413
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:36,455
out of
a church basement.

414
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,325
Really? That's... huh.

415
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:41,270
Did you know?

416
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,675
- Sir...
- You got to be kidding me.

417
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,634
No one wants to tell
me anything around here.

418
00:21:46,717 --> 00:21:48,807
Because I knew you'd
shut it down.

419
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,423
That place was her life.

420
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:52,013
She helped a lot
of people.

421
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:53,535
Have you two
spoken since?

422
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,755
I refuse to let her
turn into her mother.

423
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,254
Catherine cut a lot
of corners at Hamilton.

424
00:21:58,338 --> 00:21:59,995
Look where it got us.

425
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:02,476
I'll take that
as a no.

426
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:08,277
<i>Synthetic granulocytes.</i>

427
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,294
My god.

428
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:12,541
<i>Now injecting them
in patient B,</i>

429
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:16,356
<i>an 80-year-old male
with a similar cancer.</i>

430
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:19,235
<i>Our hypothesis is that
the new solution</i>

431
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,512
Dr. Rogers!

432
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:22,534
So much for our lead.

433
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,536
So we'll
check back in 24 hours

434
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:29,082
and look for progress.

435
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:36,509
<i>Help!
Uh, just calm down, breathe.</i>

436
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:38,523
<i>We need help in here!</i>

437
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:40,571
<i>Try to breathe.</i>

438
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:52,454
What the hell are we
dealing with?

439
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:02,787
Ryan, can you hear me?

440
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:07,732
This kryptonite gives
a worse hangover

441
00:23:07,817 --> 00:23:10,324
than $2.00 Tequila.

442
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,765
Wait. How did I get
back here?

443
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,072
Luke and I found you
outside of Angelique's.

444
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:18,228
Yeah.

445
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:22,027
But good news...
I got to drive the Batmobile.

446
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,004
Bad news... the wipers button
and the rocket launchers

447
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:26,937
look very similar.

448
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:28,355
Someone should
label those.

449
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,556
What did you do?

450
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,639
I should be asking you
that, Missy.

451
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:34,059
Why'd you go to Angelique's
in the batsuit?

452
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,845
I needed a lead
on ocean.

453
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,892
You're dying,
and you waste

454
00:23:37,977 --> 00:23:40,113
your last gasps
of energy on him?

455
00:23:40,198 --> 00:23:42,864
No. I find ocean,
I find Alice

456
00:23:42,948 --> 00:23:44,708
so I can hear
her last gasp.

457
00:23:44,793 --> 00:23:47,389
- Ryan.
- No. I am not going down

458
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:49,733
without getting justice
for both of our moms.

459
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,262
Let's just get some
more fluids in you first,

460
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:56,037
and then we can talk...
Bucket list.

461
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:05,681
This is Rogers' office.

462
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:07,223
We looked
into the deceased,

463
00:24:07,444 --> 00:24:09,130
and everyone seems
to have been involved

464
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,886
in the experiments
with the desert Rose.

465
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:14,333
My guess is they were trying
to create more and failed.

466
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:19,297
Coryana sent their
assassins to cover their tracks.

467
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:22,636
I believe Safiyah calls them
the many arms of death.

468
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,480
Let's just hope they didn't
find the map that Rogers stole.

469
00:24:25,718 --> 00:24:27,746
It has to be around here
somewhere.

470
00:24:30,263 --> 00:24:31,596
Hang on.

471
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:37,150
Bingo.

472
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:58,603
They beat us to it.

473
00:24:58,928 --> 00:25:02,107
Agh! Agh!

474
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,781
Sir.

475
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:09,605
They have my Kate,
damn it.

476
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:15,573
I can't stand losing
another daughter like this.

477
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:45,146
When I was being held
in that cell,

478
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:48,601
my father and sister
came looking for me.

479
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,398
I was told if I made a sound
they'd be shot,

480
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:59,416
but Kate, my, um...
my twin,

481
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:01,693
she found my cell,

482
00:26:02,237 --> 00:26:05,720
and I heard her
put her hand on the door,

483
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:07,638
so I did the same,

484
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:15,571
and I just stood there
silently... Praying

485
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:17,362
that she would...

486
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:20,903
Feel me.

487
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,333
And she never did?

488
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:28,471
You asked
why I want revenge.

489
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,676
It's because I can't
forget moments like that.

490
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,217
Then don't,

491
00:26:38,294 --> 00:26:39,729
but do you really
want to spend

492
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:42,757
the rest of your life trying
to get her to apologize?

493
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:45,347
Because that's not
how this works.

494
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,978
She's your sister.

495
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:48,532
She will spend
every waking moment

496
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:51,495
trying to fix it,
to fix you,

497
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:53,891
and she can't.

498
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:56,021
Only you can do that.

499
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:59,946
You got out,
you got your second chance.

500
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:01,599
Let it go.

501
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:03,514
Be happy.

502
00:27:03,697 --> 00:27:05,929
You make that sound
so...

503
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:07,819
So easy.

504
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:09,246
It is.

505
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,211
At least it is now.

506
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:15,012
Desert Rose snips.

507
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:17,789
I'll plant them,
nurture them,

508
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:19,654
feed them blood
so they bloom.

509
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,408
Pretty soon, all of mankind
will have its miracle drug,

510
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:24,219
and I'll have money
to travel the world.

511
00:27:24,304 --> 00:27:26,231
You are not supposed
to have those.

512
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:29,422
There's a lot Safiyah
tells us we can't have.

513
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:39,714
I want to do
what you did.

514
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:43,163
I want to escape,
I want to start over

515
00:27:43,248 --> 00:27:45,776
and experience life
outside this island.

516
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:57,885
And I want you
to come with me.

517
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:40,776
<i>The man
you were willing</i>

518
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,124
to change your life for,

519
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:45,582
the one person who
offered you a second chance

520
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,858
and freedom
from your past

521
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:52,774
is the same man Safiyah
convinced you to stab

522
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,185
through the heart.

523
00:28:56,604 --> 00:29:01,333
Ha ha ha!

524
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:02,978
I'm sorry. That's it?

525
00:29:03,062 --> 00:29:04,602
That's your big
mic drop moment?

526
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:06,709
"Surprise! You killed
your soul mate

527
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:08,184
that you don't even
remember."

528
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:11,470
Yeah. I found my
mother's head in a freezer,

529
00:29:11,555 --> 00:29:13,435
so if you're trying
to shock me,

530
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,305
you're gonna have to
do a little better than that.

531
00:29:32,995 --> 00:29:36,051
Don't you think you
should be lying down?

532
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:39,175
Angelique said
he grew shrooms

533
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,924
in a concrete jungle,
meaning he would need

534
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:42,780
some type
of indoor forest.

535
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,747
That means a neighborhood
with a high moisture level.

536
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:46,962
- North side by the water.
- Wait. What?

537
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:48,608
He'd have to block out
his windows,

538
00:29:48,693 --> 00:29:49,740
wouldn't want
questions asked,

539
00:29:49,824 --> 00:29:51,651
and he'd have to draw
a crapload of power

540
00:29:51,736 --> 00:29:53,296
for all those
grow lamps.

541
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,584
Oh! The grow lamps.

542
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,736
Ryan, you need to
lie down.

543
00:29:58,821 --> 00:29:59,812
I need to find Alice.

544
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:03,780
No. I... I can't let you
kill Alice.

545
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:06,109
Do you love
your mom?

546
00:30:06,402 --> 00:30:07,624
Of course I do.

547
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,416
Do you believe
in what we do here?

548
00:30:09,827 --> 00:30:11,040
You know I do.

549
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:13,884
Then how can we stand
behind this symbol

550
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:16,342
and claim we fight
for justice

551
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:17,982
and we stand up
for victims

552
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,111
and we protect
our streets

553
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:23,918
with a legitimate serial-killing
psychopath out there,

554
00:30:24,204 --> 00:30:26,202
living, breathing,

555
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:28,334
looking for a way to find
your sister

556
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:29,630
- and kill her, too?
- And we will stop her!

557
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:30,467
When?

558
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,055
When two crows bring
me some miracle flower

559
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,138
from an island
we can't get to?

560
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,489
- That's what I was...
- Did they find the map?

561
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:40,072
Did they find the map?

562
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:41,972
The map's gone.

563
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:49,549
Alice took our moms
from us, Mary.

564
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,811
Do you ever
for a second

565
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,661
think about what your life
would be like

566
00:30:54,745 --> 00:30:56,158
if she were
still here?

567
00:30:58,678 --> 00:31:01,149
If she could be proud
of you for one more day,

568
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:03,282
if you could ask her
for advice

569
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:05,186
or tell her
about a crush

570
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:07,690
or hear her tell you
she loves you?

571
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:09,730
A million times a day.

572
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,729
I am as good as dead,
Mary,

573
00:31:13,182 --> 00:31:14,502
and I am not
leaving here

574
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:16,085
without getting
justice,

575
00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:20,892
so... you can step
out of my way

576
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:22,183
and let me do
my thing,

577
00:31:22,268 --> 00:31:24,100
or I can go
through you.

578
00:31:28,237 --> 00:31:29,736
Keys are in dino.

579
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,042
What are you doing?

580
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,041
Packing up.
We're done.

581
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:57,075
You don't want to
know more?

582
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:00,094
What's to know?

583
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:01,992
Safiyah got jealous,
so she took away

584
00:32:02,077 --> 00:32:04,222
my memory of ocean
to punish me.

585
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,846
I could have saved
a lot of time

586
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:07,000
by reading the back
of the book.

587
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:10,250
It wasn't as simple as plucking
out just those memories.

588
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:12,581
There was
collateral damage.

589
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,633
I never thought
I'd see the day

590
00:32:15,718 --> 00:32:17,903
that a man I considered
a brother

591
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:20,479
would be kneeling before me
a betrayer of his island

592
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,944
and his people!

593
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:25,479
That flower is
everything to us,

594
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,133
that which defines us,

595
00:32:27,218 --> 00:32:29,270
that which is the key
to our survival!

596
00:32:29,363 --> 00:32:31,570
Safiyah, we both know this
isn't about a stupid flower.

597
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:33,410
And what do you
think it's about?

598
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,786
Me having the one thing
you can't.

599
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:40,647
Alice
is a snake

600
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:43,338
that slithered
into our garden.

601
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:46,100
Let me kill her.

602
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:48,691
We're not killing anyone.

603
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:52,529
I'm going to visit
a punishment upon her

604
00:32:52,614 --> 00:32:54,378
that fits the crime.

605
00:32:54,657 --> 00:32:57,655
Find enigma,
bring her to me.

606
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:01,811
Safiyah, no.
You can't do this.

607
00:33:02,222 --> 00:33:04,429
Yes, my queen.

608
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:06,441
You wanted to take
the one thing that was

609
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:07,541
precious to me.

610
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:10,125
I will take what's
most precious to you...

611
00:33:10,608 --> 00:33:12,023
Each other!

612
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:14,399
- Who's enigma?
- A hypnotist.

613
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:16,202
She wants to screw
with our heads.

614
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,417
You're not a snake, Alice.

615
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,560
You're just
a broken little girl,

616
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,228
who sought refuge
from her trauma

617
00:33:22,313 --> 00:33:25,354
by escaping
into a fantastical book!

618
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:28,757
I know the big, wild world
seemed daunting to you.

619
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:30,452
I was going to show you
how easily

620
00:33:30,537 --> 00:33:32,994
you could rise and thrive,

621
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:36,141
but instead, you turned to
him for solace and rehabilitation.

622
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,224
She didn't do
anything wrong!

623
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:42,680
You are going to
go home, Alice!

624
00:33:42,764 --> 00:33:46,262
You are going to embrace
this fairytale persona of yours,

625
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:50,094
and you're going to imbue it
with fury!

626
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:52,761
You will build
your own army,

627
00:33:52,845 --> 00:33:55,416
you will become your own queen,

628
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:58,134
and you will carry out
the vengeance on your family

629
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:00,715
that you
so desperately crave,

630
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:04,328
and you'll forget
all about ocean

631
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:06,940
and your love
for each other!

632
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,256
Don't do this,
Safiyah.

633
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:12,339
<i>With the memories came</i>

634
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:16,418
the love and humanity that
was bubbling up inside of you.

635
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:20,087
Safiyah took that
and in turn

636
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:22,631
activated this...

637
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:25,409
Cold, hard,

638
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,669
vengeance-obsessed
killing machine.

639
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:30,956
You would have
run away with ocean

640
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:32,627
and started
a new life,

641
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:35,632
happy, free, in love.

642
00:34:35,717 --> 00:34:39,961
Instead, Safiyah
turned you into herself.

643
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:42,057
You look upset.

644
00:34:42,203 --> 00:34:44,517
Shakespearian enough
for you?

645
00:34:52,866 --> 00:34:54,473
Take the body.

646
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:57,906
I'll call you
for my pickup.

647
00:34:58,988 --> 00:35:00,696
Where are you going?

648
00:35:00,795 --> 00:35:02,835
Oh, I'm not requesting
an audience with the queen

649
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,628
dressed like this.

650
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:17,396
Gotcha.

651
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:19,105
- Enigma did this?
- Mm-hmm.

652
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,731
Of course.

653
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:22,364
She's a hypnotist.

654
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:23,786
Owed Safiyah
a favor.

655
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:27,188
Safiyah and her legion
of lady loyalists.

656
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,567
Tatiana found out you were
stealing the desert Rose.

657
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:33,022
Good riddance.
That flower's meant to save lives,

658
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:36,390
yet it destroys
everything it touches.

659
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:45,254
And... I guess
this is it.

660
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,165
There's a bar
in portofino

661
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,411
I've always
wanted to try.

662
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:53,337
Cobblestone streets,
view of the harbor.

663
00:35:57,598 --> 00:36:00,281
What about you?
What now?

664
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,511
Uh... now I'm off
to Coryana

665
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:06,512
to get my final revenge
on my sister.

666
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:13,884
Unless... you have
a reason to stop me.

667
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,510
Live your life.

668
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,875
See you, Alice.

669
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:44,444
Where's Ryan?

670
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:45,668
My dad couldn't find
the map,

671
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:46,916
so there's no way
to find Coryana.

672
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,457
Why are her comms off?
Where is she?

673
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,105
- She's gonna die.
- Mary, where is Ryan?

674
00:36:52,573 --> 00:36:55,287
Alice, do you know
who I am?

675
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:58,161
Ok. I've had a day.

676
00:36:58,246 --> 00:37:02,457
Can we do this in,
say, 2... 3 weeks?

677
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:05,759
Do you know who I am?

678
00:37:05,897 --> 00:37:07,794
Honestly, so many women
keep showing up

679
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:09,878
in that outfit, it's
impossible to keep track.

680
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:11,590
How's this?

681
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:18,458
You killed my mom,

682
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:20,629
and now I'm here
to kill you.

683
00:37:20,714 --> 00:37:24,712
Heh. You're kidding,
right?

684
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:27,207
That's what this
is about?

685
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:29,493
My mom was Cora Lewis.

686
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:34,879
Your gang beat her to death
on December 13, 2015.

687
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:37,112
I get it.
Mommy died,

688
00:37:37,484 --> 00:37:40,191
and now you're
a "woman on fire,"

689
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:42,523
which means I'm
responsible for spawning

690
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:45,640
not one batwoman...
But two.

691
00:37:45,725 --> 00:37:47,641
- You think this is funny?
- Yes.

692
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:50,147
My mom meant
everything to me!

693
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:53,105
I have no memory
of your mommy.

694
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,855
- Liar!
- Unh!

695
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,481
Aah!

696
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:01,145
Aw. Did you hurt
yourself?

697
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,047
Is that my fault, too?

698
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,582
Unh!

699
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:20,264
Aah! Ohh!

700
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:21,956
Unh!

701
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:29,384
Aah!

702
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,394
Hyah!

703
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,929
- Raah!
- Aah!

704
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,692
I wasn't the one
who killed her.

705
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:50,159
Your army did

706
00:38:50,437 --> 00:38:52,142
because of you
because you turned them

707
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,375
into coldblooded killers!

708
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,538
- Ha ha ha!
- Aah!

709
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:03,369
Agh!

710
00:39:05,536 --> 00:39:06,909
Ryan!

711
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:08,687
This isn't the girl
I raised.

712
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:13,756
But she killed you.

713
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,585
Agh!

714
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:19,259
Ugh.

715
00:39:23,414 --> 00:39:25,958
I don't know
what made you this way,

716
00:39:26,762 --> 00:39:28,285
but you're not
worth it.

717
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,185
You'll never
be worth it!

718
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,244
It wasn't my fault.

719
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:36,668
Everything's
your fault.

720
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,262
Now leave!

721
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:57,877
No sign of Alice
anywhere, sir.

722
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:01,783
You know, I figured out
why Catherine lied

723
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,116
and said that Beth
was dead.

724
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:07,865
She was doing me a favor.

725
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,780
The only thing worse than
losing one of your children

726
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:14,196
is the cycle
of waking up every morning

727
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,632
with hope and then
having it ripped away

728
00:40:19,065 --> 00:40:21,426
and losing them all over
again by dinner.

729
00:40:23,402 --> 00:40:26,150
Sir, you really
should get some sleep.

730
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:29,248
I won't sleep until
I have my family back.

731
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,999
This must be
the airport shuttle.

732
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:46,541
Get in.

733
00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:56,156
Air Coryana terminal,
Jeevsy.

734
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:05,493
Where's Alice?

735
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:09,363
Hello to you, too.

736
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:15,676
Well, I realized killing
her would only

737
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:17,742
make me more like her.

738
00:41:17,827 --> 00:41:19,675
Kind of went along
with what you guys were saying.

739
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:21,175
Great.
So where is she?

740
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,945
- I let her go.
- What?! Ok.

741
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,780
There's not killing,
but there's still apprehending.

742
00:41:25,925 --> 00:41:28,215
We need her to go
to Coryana.

743
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,799
No, we don't.
She'll kill Kate.

744
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,466
I'll stop her.

745
00:41:34,755 --> 00:41:36,545
I put a tracker
in her boot.

746
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:40,525
We follow her,
we find Coryana,

747
00:41:40,837 --> 00:41:42,287
we save Kate.

748
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,698
And we get you
the desert Rose.
