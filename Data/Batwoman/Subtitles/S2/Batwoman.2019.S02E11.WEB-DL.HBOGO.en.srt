1
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,840
Come on. Hurry it up.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,680
Easy.

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,880
You lasted three
pathetic days behind bars.

4
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,480
Before you broke
and tried to bring me down.

5
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
I swear.

6
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,280
- I didn't sell you out.
- If you'd taken a fall as I asked,

7
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,680
Did you really think
I was gonna let you rot in prison?

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,400
I needed you...

9
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,320
to be my Michelin-star chef.

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,840
Ever since Ocean's disappearance

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,440
We've had issues with quality control.

12
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,080
He always said
the Snakebite formula

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,040
was toxic if it wasn't cooked using
his "secret method."

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
I can help you.

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,400
Well, the final ingredient
will be delivered soon

16
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,120
and if I've gone through
all this trouble

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,920
Just to find out you
can't cook after all, well...

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,520
at least I have what I need
to dissolve your body.

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,840
Hey, we don't know much,

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,600
but the good news is
I think she's alive.

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
<i>You didn't find a body?
It was an ambush.</i>

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,040
<i>We found the bodies of the agents</i>

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,000
transporting her,
but Angelique was gone.

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,600
Okay, okay.
So False Face got her.

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,920
Well, where did It happen?
Descriptions, place!

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,080
Ryan, leave this alone.

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,360
False Face is dropping
bodies all over Gotham.

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,080
Will you let me help you?

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,560
How? How can you help us?

30
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,400
I know, Angelique the best.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,000
Stand down and let me do my job.
I'll call you when I have news.

32
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,160
{\an5}Crowphie says Ang was
kidnapped by False Face.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,600
Damn it. If Ang had
just let me help her.

34
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,800
And said False Face wanted her
to cook Snakebite, yeah?

35
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,360
{\an5}Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's why she tried to get out.

36
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,880
{\an5}- She didn't want that life.
- Well, they still want it for her.

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,240
Eyewitnesses reported that two cars
ambushed the SUV that Ang was inside.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,920
{\an5}A couple hours later, those same cars

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,120
{\an5}were involved in a heist
at Gotham pharmaceutical.

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,640
They're stocking up on supplies.

41
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,800
Do they need anything else?

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,880
{\an5}The one ingredient that wouldn't
be at that warehouse is fear toxin.

43
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
So, they'll hit somewhere else.
Can you put a trace on those cars?

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,280
Well, I flagged them
both in the city grid

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
{\an5}so as soon as either one makes an
appearance on traffic cams,

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,880
{\an5}- you're up, Batwoman.
- Good. I'll be ready.

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
{\an5}You gonna loop in Sophie?

48
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,680
{\an5}So, Ang can slip through
her fingers again?

49
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,880
{\an5}Not a chance.

50
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Dr. Rhyme?

51
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
From the look of things.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,440
{\an5}I'm Jackson, your new patient.

53
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,720
Yes. My 5.30.

54
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,680
Please sit down.

55
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,800
{\an5}I am sitting, so...

56
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,640
This is very disturbing.

57
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,440
{\an5}You mean, my divorce?

58
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,000
{\an5}I can read between the lines,
you sick puppy.

59
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
{\an5}Who hurt you?

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm so sorry. I'm running late.

61
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
What is going on here?

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,440
Lost cause.
I saved you the headache...

63
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Enigma.

64
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,000
You were working
with Julia Pennyworth.

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,800
And I appreciate you
sending her on a long...

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
vacation.

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,640
Because I need some
alone time with you.

68
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,240
Safiyah hired me

69
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,480
{\an5}to erase your memories of Ocean.

70
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,840
{\an5}You're obviously here
to get them back.

71
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,200
I assume that's what
this is all about.

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,320
{\an5}From what I recall

73
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
{\an5}you were in love

74
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,480
{\an5}I made you forget your feelings

75
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,840
{\an5}And consequently
helped turn you into...

76
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
You.

77
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
{\an5}Keep them.

78
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,040
I don't need the hassle.

79
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,640
{\an5}Then why did you track me down?

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,400
{\an5}I have someone else.
I need to forget.

81
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
{\an5}My sister.

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Kate.

83
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,280
<i>Don't deviate
from your individual route.</i>

84
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,360
<i>You have four minutes
to reach pickup</i>

85
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,760
<i>or we'll consider you burned.</i>

86
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,160
<i>See you at the finish line.</i>

87
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,880
Tell me where they're going!

88
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,320
You have no idea
what you've just done.

89
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm burned.

90
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,360
Thanks a lot.

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Excuse me?

92
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,520
No, It's not my fault you stole
the car I was looking for!

93
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,280
I was undercover!

94
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,760
We I.D.ed the driver
and brought him into custody

95
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,720
- so I could switch places.
- Are you in the middle of the heist?

96
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,400
- Get in the car and drive!
- I told you.

97
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm burned!

98
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,760
Black Mask gives out
the location on these phones

99
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,400
minutes before the heist begins.

100
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,120
And he only gives the drop-off info
after the pickup is complete.

101
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,480
And if you show up late...

102
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,920
They know something's
up and aborted.

103
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,560
Everything was on the phone.

104
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Now, it's wiped.

105
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,080
And I got nothing.

106
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,000
You're the one who said
we'd never be partners.

107
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
Stay out of my business.

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,920
You are alive because you have
an uncanny ability to erase memories.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,840
And as much as my dear sister

110
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
is very much deceased in reality...

111
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
She lives on...

112
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
In here.

113
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,440
I've been having
hallucinations of her.

114
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,600
What does she look like?

115
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,360
The way she did when we were 13

116
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,760
before everything changed.

117
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,080
Do you understand...

118
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,960
why she appears to you as a child

119
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,600
and why that means you
shouldn't erase her?

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,520
You are working pro-bono here, doc.

121
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Why don't we just...

122
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,880
skip through the diagnosis,
and go straight to the treatment?

123
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,680
Because you're asking me
to excise a person

124
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,240
From your memory
who's been in your life

125
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,760
since you shared your mother's womb.

126
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,440
Whether you admit it or not,

127
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,880
Kate matters to you.

128
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,640
Erasing her will radically
change your personality.

129
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,240
Yeah. I'll stop hallucinating.

130
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,520
Kate's memory isn't a cancer
inside your brain.

131
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
In fact, I believe she's
your last moral compass.

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,160
Well, I'd hate to lose that.

133
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,720
You are a monster, Alice...

134
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,600
But you're rational.

135
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Imagine,

136
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,000
if you were at the mercy of

137
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,640
every dark impulse.

138
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,640
Is that what you want?

139
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,360
I am not into self-reflection...

140
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,920
And considering this,

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,080
is apparently our doing,

142
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,240
I'd say you owe me.

143
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,680
Okay, but...

144
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
we have to do this safely.

145
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
So...

146
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,040
you need to confront Kate,

147
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,320
and make these visions disappear.

148
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,680
Then in theory, I can wipe
her from your memory

149
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,240
Without completely fracturing your
psyche.

150
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
It's the only way this

151
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
might work.

152
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,800
Now, see, that is
a positive attitude.

153
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Okay.

154
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,880
Commander, I have an update. I...

155
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Agent Moore.

156
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,960
Agent Tavaroff and I
were just discussing

157
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,400
Your False Face operation.

158
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
What's the latest?

159
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,880
Unfortunately, Batwoman interfered

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,520
And they aborted the whole thing.

161
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,920
Do you have a line
on the other drivers?

162
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Not yet.

163
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,960
Black Mask executed

164
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,480
three Crows agents.

165
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,440
If he gets away with that, It's gonna
be open season on us all.

166
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,040
That'll be all, Tavaroff.

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yes, Commander.

168
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,520
I'll find another way in.

169
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,920
You put yourself behind the wheel

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,280
of a heist car?

171
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,720
I didn't have time to bring
another agent up to speed, sir.

172
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,280
Do you want to know my theory?

173
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
I think...

174
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,120
you guaranteed your informant

175
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,640
She'd be safe and now,
Black Mask has her.

176
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
You're making it personal

177
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,880
and it's gonna get you killed.

178
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,920
I'm doing my job. I...

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,080
So am I.

180
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,560
Effective immediately,
I'm putting Agent Tavaroff

181
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,880
in charge of the operation.

182
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,080
Sir, respectfully,

183
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,800
Russell Tavaroff shouldn't be
leading a hostage recovery.

184
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,080
He'll go in guns blazing.

185
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
False Face declared war on us,

186
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,440
not the other way around!

187
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,880
I am not letting you throw
yourself in front of a bullet

188
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,040
for Angelique Martin!

189
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,320
She picked her side!

190
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,560
Commander, what is this
actually about?

191
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
- You've been really off lately...
- Get out!

192
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
Get out!

193
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,920
My lead on Angelique didn't pan out.

194
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
That's it?

195
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040
You're giving up?

196
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,800
Kane sent me home.

197
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,560
Got my cover blown
by Batwoman, but...

198
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,680
somehow...

199
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
that's my fault.

200
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Come on, Soph.

201
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,280
This is BS.

202
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Ryan.

203
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,360
I don't want to freak you out

204
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,760
but the new guy who's taken the lead

205
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,520
He is going to scorch the earth
to take down False Face

206
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,160
And that includes Angelique.

207
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,240
Okay. Does this guy know
where Angelique is?

208
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,000
It's only a matter of time.

209
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,760
Okay. Well, we need
to find her first.

210
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,800
What I need is an undercover asset

211
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,240
Who can drive a car like
she just qualified for the Indy 500.

212
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,480
- Why is that?
- False Face

213
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,200
is planning another fear toxin heist

214
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,040
just as soon as
he finds a new driver.

215
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Oh, no.

216
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,360
- No way.
- Come on.

217
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,720
I am good. I can prove it to you.

218
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,600
Girl, it is way too dangerous.

219
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,920
Okay, so is sitting here
feeling sorry for ourselves

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,200
when a homicidal drug lord
is using my ex to cook his dope.

221
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Look.

222
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,800
You and I got Ang into this mess.

223
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
We need to find her
before your Crows do.

224
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,760
What other options have you got?

225
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,520
Take a deep breath, Alice.

226
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
What is that?

227
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,040
What do you feel?

228
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,120
Don't be a smartass.
Just answer quickly.

229
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
A warm hand.

230
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
Good.

231
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Go figure.

232
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,080
So, you want me
to leave you alone?

233
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Turns out you're a paradox.

234
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,000
You gave me the idea
to erase Kate in my mind.

235
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,160
Kudos for that.

236
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,160
But you also happen to be Kate,

237
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,280
so...

238
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
there's the door.

239
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,640
What am I missing?

240
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Stop that.

241
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
Make me!

242
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,200
You always thought, you knew me
better than I knew myself.

243
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,160
That's why you're so scared of me.

244
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,840
I can see you have
so much love to give.

245
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
You would see it, too,

246
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,320
if you just look at yourself.

247
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,880
You condescending,
little know-it-all.

248
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,240
Do you want to know
who I really am?

249
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,200
A manipulator.

250
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,080
I wanted you to think I loved you

251
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,640
as much as you loved me
because that's what sisters do

252
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,240
but I felt nothing!

253
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
For you.

254
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
For anyone.

255
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,600
You're not remembering right.

256
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,480
I should have told you the truth.

257
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,360
I was born

258
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,520
with this bad brain

259
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,680
And it is only capable of hate

260
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,640
and jealousy, and bitterness.

261
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
That's not true.

262
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,160
You wouldn't have taken
so many bullets to save me.

263
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Beth...

264
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I'm your sister

265
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,840
and I'll always believe in you.

266
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Thanks, sis.

267
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,240
That means a lot to me.

268
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,560
Except it doesn't
because you're dead.

269
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,400
A master manipulator
with no feelings.

270
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,400
Give me a break.

271
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,240
Isn't she so silly?

272
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
No, no, no.

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,280
I just got rid of you!

274
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Doctor...

275
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,720
I'm beginning to think
You're toying with me.

276
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Nice!

277
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,480
Okay, okay. Let me see.

278
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,680
Mary was sweet enough
to lend us her car

279
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,600
But if there is so much as a bug
on the windshield after this,

280
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,040
she made it clear we'll both
end up In the trunk.

281
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Look at all these...

282
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Cylinders.

283
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Can I take it for a spin?

284
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,000
I got some info from the last
driver on how he was hired.

285
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,200
You'll have to run through a series
of street-racing moves.

286
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,920
No way of knowing
what they'll be.

287
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,680
- Piece of cake.
- They're gonna interview you.

288
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,840
You'll have to know
everything about this car

289
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,880
- and how to maneuver it.
- Okay, okay. Well,

290
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,520
we got the gas pedal.

291
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,880
I'm kidding, okay?

292
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,960
Do you know what red-lining is,

293
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,720
what backpedaling means,

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,880
how to measure your camber
and airflow?

295
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,240
Are you helping me,

296
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,560
or are you just looking for an
excuse to call this off?

297
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,040
I just want this to work.

298
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,480
We are going to get Ang back, okay?

299
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,280
I'll do my part. I'll study.

300
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,480
What happens after they hire me?

301
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,800
You'll wait for the
coordinates of the pickup,

302
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,680
They'll put the payload in your car,

303
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,600
and on your way to the drop-off,

304
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,600
you pull over and place
the tracking device

305
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,720
inside the fear toxin canister.

306
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,920
That will lead us
to where they have Angelique.

307
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Okay. When's the interview?

308
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,120
Without the Crows,

309
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,760
I had to reach out to someone
for help setting it up.

310
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
But don't worry.

311
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
He's trustworthy.

312
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,920
Ryan, is it?

313
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Look here.

314
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
No prob, Larry.

315
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,800
- Luke. Luke. Sorry, sorry.
- No worries.

316
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,520
You're Mary's roommate, yeah?

317
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,720
You know what? I... I actually think
I served you here once.

318
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,480
Shirley Temple, right?

319
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,200
I don't think that was me.

320
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,800
Can we save the getting
to know each other part for later?

321
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Come on.

322
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Yeah.

323
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
All right.

324
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,160
I just deployed your false identity.

325
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,480
Robyn Wilde?

326
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,480
Yeah. It's...

327
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,560
harder to screw up if it's closer
to your real name.

328
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,800
So, you are a fast
and furious getaway driver

329
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,200
with a rap sheet ten-mile long

330
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,400
and I'm gonna spoof
a text message

331
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,200
from a known False Face associate

332
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,720
recommending you for the job.

333
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
And...

334
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Done.

335
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,600
Luke...

336
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
I owe you one.

337
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,120
- Thanks.
- No problem.

338
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,880
I'm gonna go gas up the car.

339
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
What's this?

340
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,800
Comms for us to communicate
without Sophie knowing.

341
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,360
A tracker to place
on the fear toxin,

342
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
and a portable version
of the Batmobile's A.I.

343
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
A.I?

344
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What A.I?

345
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
You didn't notice I installed it
with the new paint job?

346
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
What?

347
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,720
I thought my driving skills
were getting better.

348
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Yeah, no.

349
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Hook it up to Mary's ride

350
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,520
so you don't bounce
off too many walls.

351
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Fine.

352
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Hey.

353
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm just gonna say it.

354
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,760
I realize Ang is in trouble,

355
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
but you teaming up
with Sophie like this, these lies...

356
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
it's a bad idea.

357
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,880
She's gonna figure out who you are.
She's smart.

358
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,560
She still thinks I'm lucky
not to be in jail.

359
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I'll be fine.

360
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,600
You said confront Kate

361
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,240
so I destroyed that little
snot-nosed twerp

362
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,600
and then Ocean comes in
and ruins it!

363
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,600
I wasn't even thinking
about him!

364
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,480
When Safiyah ordered me
to erase your memories of Ocean,

365
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,960
you begged me not to do it.

366
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Begged?

367
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,440
Either you're being dramatic,
or I was.

368
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Ocean came back into your life,

369
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,120
and unlocked a piece
of your memory.

370
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
Which is proof that Kate,

371
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,240
your subconscious was correct.

372
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,920
You are capable
of emotion and attachment.

373
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
Do you want to know
why you're wrong?

374
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,240
Because I killed Ocean...

375
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
And I felt...

376
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Nothing.

377
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,440
So, rip these hideous ghosts
out of my mind!

378
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Not impressed?

379
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,800
Come on. I just did a 360,
and drifted

380
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,000
the entire width of the Tarmac

381
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,360
like <i>Fast & Furious: Gotham Drift.</i>

382
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,120
What's the horsepower on your ride?

383
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,120
Well, she came
with the standard 1,500

384
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,040
till I tuned the ECU
and now, she tops out at 1,774.

385
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
Speed...

386
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,200
I've hit 305, but I can
push her in a pinch.

387
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,640
First job's tonight.

388
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,440
Kind of waiting for an
important phone call here.

389
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,560
<i>Hey. We got a problem.</i>

390
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,480
FAA says there's an unknown
drone in the sky above you.

391
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,720
<i>It's got to be False Face.</i>

392
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,760
If you pull over to plant that
tracker, they'll see it.

393
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,280
We got to call this off.

394
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,840
We won't get
another chance at this.

395
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,280
Maybe I can do it without stopping.

396
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,760
Fear toxin canisters
are double sealed, unstable.

397
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,280
<i>If you inhale even
one breath of the stuff...</i>

398
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,360
Can you just trust me on this?

399
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,720
No! Abort! Abort, Ryan!

400
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Hey, Luke.
Exactly how intelligent is my A.I.?

401
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,120
You'll be fine. It works in remote
just like your Batmobile.

402
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,200
I'm really missing
my Batsuit right now.

403
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,760
You have the cargo,
you have your route.

404
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,880
If you're late,
we'll consider you burned.

405
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,480
See you at the finish line.

406
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Let's go.

407
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Okay.

408
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,520
You're up, batcave.

409
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,320
Okay. Okay.

410
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Seriously?

411
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,360
And I'm the one who's
a bad driver?

412
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,720
Sorry, sorry. Still getting
the hang of this.

413
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
Oh, crap.

414
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
<i>We got Crows on our tail.</i>

415
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,240
How fast can you take over again?

416
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,400
I just need a little more time.

417
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,960
<i>Hold her steady.</i>

418
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,560
I'm opening up
The canister right now.

419
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,760
Was that gunfire? are we hit?

420
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,320
Can you just try to lose them?

421
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,240
Red light!

422
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,280
Oh, god, Oh, god, oh, god!

423
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
Tracker's on.

424
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,640
Who's the best driver
in all of Gotham?

425
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Oh, that's me.

426
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Sophie.

427
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,320
Come bow down to your girl!

428
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,280
Ryan.

429
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,560
Hey! Where's Sophie?

430
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,640
She asked for the tracker data
and told me to meet you guys here.

431
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,080
She ditched us for the Crows?

432
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
No.

433
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
No, no, no. She...

434
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,520
She was too worried they'd storm
the place and kill Ang.

435
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
She's taking on False Face herself.

436
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,920
Cut deeper this time.

437
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,800
I want Ocean gone.

438
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Shut your eyes.

439
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,960
Take a deep breath.

440
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,080
Focus on what your
senses are telling you.

441
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,000
What you hear.

442
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,240
What you feel.

443
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
That happened fast.

444
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,080
It's almost like you'd
rather be here with me.

445
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,480
Are we sure
we're in my subconscious?

446
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,920
What am I doing
in Ocean's sex dream?

447
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,520
I'm guessing you brought me...

448
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
here...

449
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,960
to apologize.

450
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,400
Why'd you kill me?

451
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,640
Wouldn't you like to know?

452
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,800
You killed me

453
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,040
for nothing.

454
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,000
You would have done
the same to me.

455
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,320
No. No chance in hell.

456
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,920
There's screwed up,

457
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,600
and then there's you.

458
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Is this real?

459
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,000
This feels real.

460
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,240
You tell me. I thought
you said you killed him.

461
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
I'm alive.

462
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,920
And very pissed off.

463
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,680
I... stabbed you.

464
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,400
I watched you die.

465
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,840
Let's roll the replay.

466
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,440
Safiyah wanted me dead.

467
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,560
She enlisted a woman who
could twirl a balisong in her sleep

468
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
but insisted

469
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,880
you use one of her knives instead.

470
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,640
She dipped the blade
in desert rose.

471
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Didn't I say...

472
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,120
you're a crappy assassin?

473
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,320
Don't tell me
you're working for Safiyah.

474
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,960
Her fancy, out-of-network
lobotomist stole our memories.

475
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,600
We deserved worse.

476
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,840
I betrayed my sister.

477
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,200
I jeopardized my entire island's
safety because of you.

478
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,840
An outsider.

479
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,480
I'm in Gotham on other business

480
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,960
but I thought I'd track you down

481
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,640
look you in the eye
and ask you myself...

482
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,120
Why'd you do it?

483
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm relieved my other
victims can't ask me the same.

484
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Alice!

485
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,560
I need to know.

486
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,000
If I regret it?

487
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,560
If I've thought of you...

488
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,600
every day...

489
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,600
since Coryana?

490
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,840
It was the only way
I could get my sister back.

491
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
See?

492
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Manipulator.

493
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,760
Mockingbird anew.

494
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
What did you do?

495
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,600
The one thing I promised Safiyah

496
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
I would never do.

497
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,400
You'll be fine In a few minutes.

498
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
<i>Ciao.</i>

499
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,040
You'll forget all about Ocean,

500
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,040
and your love for each other!

501
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
Safiyah, no.

502
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,640
You... you can't do this.

503
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,640
I remember us.

504
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Hi.

505
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Everything.

506
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
She's unlocking our memories.

507
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,480
You shouldn't be here.

508
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,320
- Where's Angelique?
- No, no, no.

509
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,480
You're not the one
asking the questions.

510
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
<i>How did you find this place?</i>

511
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,360
<i>Why did you come here alone?</i>

512
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,400
If I only kill one Crow today,

513
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,240
I'll fall asleep depressed.

514
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,720
I have eyes
on Crows headquarters.

515
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,600
There's no activity, there's no
strike team being mobilized.

516
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,280
You did come here
alone, didn't you?

517
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,000
They're on their way.

518
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,200
It's funny.
When I told the bat

519
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,920
how personal this was to me,

520
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,040
I thought the Crows would take
me more seriously

521
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
Not less.

522
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
Oh, she didn't tell you.

523
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,080
Well, that's an embarrassing
lack of coordination.

524
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,800
- We'll work on it.
- No, you won't.

525
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,760
I don't know how you
found this facility,

526
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,600
but it's important to me
that you're not followed.

527
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,880
Don't worry, though.

528
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,080
I'll make sure
we dump your body

529
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,200
somewhere they'll find it.

530
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,680
Come on.

531
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,360
So, this is how it goes?

532
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,480
She saves you,
you save her. Sweet.

533
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,920
But now who's left
to save you both?

534
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
We're tired of your crap.

535
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,120
We don't need anyone
else saving us.

536
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,000
Angelique. Where is she?

537
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,680
I'll be happy to show you.

538
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,840
Wave hello to your fans, Angelique.

539
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Hey.

540
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,000
I need you to watch,

541
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,920
as these two let me go.

542
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,960
And if they don't

543
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,440
I need you to shoot her.

544
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,280
Now, that is some terrific branding,

545
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,480
but you should really
consider bringing a gun

546
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,240
to a gun fight.

547
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,000
Sorry for the delay
getting these delivered.

548
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,920
Minor catastrophe
at my warehouse.

549
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,600
Mondays, you know.

550
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,480
Things better here?

551
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,800
Just finished the first cook,

552
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,760
But this is all-new equipment

553
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,000
and I want to talk to you
about how we should roll it out.

554
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,120
Well, I thought we might
allow you to be

555
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,720
- The ceremonial first recipient.
- Actually...

556
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
I'm sober.

557
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,200
You don't want me
lose my time, do you?

558
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,480
Couldn't care less, my dear.

559
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Wait!

560
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,440
I was Ocean's assistant, but he
never gave me the full technique.

561
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
I had to guess.

562
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,600
And this formula
could be deadly?

563
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,080
You are an endless disappointment.

564
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,160
Oh! I'll help you find Ocean.

565
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,880
How'd you know where to find me?

566
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Got lucky.

567
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,400
Safiyah gave me Enigma's info

568
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,320
And told me to use it If I needed
help on my mission,

569
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,880
So, when I called the doc yesterday

570
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,800
she said someone
was tracking her

571
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,520
that her identity might be blown.

572
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
Figured it was you.

573
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,360
And this supersecret mission
Safiyah sent you on?

574
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,080
You destroyed all of the
desert rose on Coryana.

575
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,720
She really didn't have, like,

576
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,440
a seed bunker or something?

577
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,800
Never thought we needed one.

578
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,120
That island had been safe
for hundreds of years

579
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,280
until you came around.

580
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,760
Put that up on my wall.

581
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,560
Safiyah thought our
family's legacy was destroyed

582
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,040
until I told her there was one

583
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,680
plant left.

584
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
The one you stole.

585
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,720
Do you know where it is?

586
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,720
Safiyah thinks Batwoman has it.

587
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,760
That's why she's not dead
from kryptonite poisoning.

588
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Look.

589
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,520
I made my feelings very clear
on Coryana both times.

590
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,880
You've been...

591
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,320
Harder to read

592
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,440
what with the stabbing and all.

593
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Do you regret it?

594
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
Does it matter?

595
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,400
Answer the damn question.

596
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,240
I had a world-class shrink tell me
that I was a monster today, so...

597
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
Do...

598
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
You...

599
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Regret it?

600
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,480
Are you not hearing me?

601
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,160
I literally had it in me

602
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,360
to stab a knife through your heart.

603
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So?

604
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
So...

605
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,080
Just in case I get the urge again

606
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
We should...

607
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,680
probably get something
out of the way.

608
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,560
Damn.

609
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Agent Tavaroff.

610
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,440
Think we've got
everything we need here.

611
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,240
We'll meet you back at the lab.

612
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
Thank you.

613
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,200
I'll be a few minutes behind you.

614
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

615
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,800
<i>It works in remote just
like your Batmobile.</i>

616
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,200
<i>Oh. I'm really missing
my Batsuit right now.</i>

617
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Oh, my God.
