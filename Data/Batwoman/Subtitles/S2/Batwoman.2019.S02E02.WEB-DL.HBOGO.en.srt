1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,720
Now we mustn't wake him.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,240
Oh, I loathe the bats!

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,040
What is happening?
Why are they here?

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,280
Because bats eat rats, Alice.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
Rat...

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Meet Mouse.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,720
I'm gonna need your help
one last time,

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,960
my little Mouse.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,720
Someone... Quite literally
crashed our tea party,...

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,600
but she forgot to take
her party favor,...

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,320
so I'm gonna need you
to make sure she gets it.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,840
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little bat</i>

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,320
<i>How I wonder where you're at</i>

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,480
<i>Up above the world you fly</i>

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,120
<i>Like a tea tray in the sky</i>

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,000
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little bat</i>

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,920
<i>Up until your brain went splat...</i>

18
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,000
It's like a treat.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,040
Where's your cash?

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,000
I got three collection agencies
asking me the same thing.

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,120
You got an atm card?

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
You're just setting yourself
up for more disappointment.

23
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,400
Guess you got nothing
except a smart mouth.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,280
Thank you!

25
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,200
{\an5}And I don't know about
your other security guards

26
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
{\an5}but I have been trained in half
a dozen forms of martial arts

27
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,920
{\an5}so, beating up bad guys
won't be a problem.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,200
You were certainly
around enough of them...

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,160
In Blackgate.

30
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,280
{\an5}Well, what it doesn't say
is that I didn't do it.

31
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,240
{\an5}Why'd you tell the judge you did?

32
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,200
{\an5}To avoid doing 15 years
instead of 18 months.

33
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,600
Judge gave me a choice...

34
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,080
{\an5}Plead out to a lesser charge,
do a bullet and a half.

35
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
Look.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I get it.

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,240
{\an5}Blackgate doesn't look good
on a resume

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,960
{\an5}but it did give me
a valuable skillset.

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,800
{\an5}Every second you're inside,
you're assessing threats

40
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,560
{\an5}trying to figure out
who's dangerous.

41
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,680
{\an5}You get real good
at reading people.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,160
{\an5}Faces can tell you a lot.

43
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,040
And what does mine tell you?

44
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,640
{\an5}That I'm not getting this job.

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
<i>In this exclusive video</i>

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,720
<i>you can see Crows officers
opening fire on Batwoman.</i>

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,160
<i>This ambush comes after
the Crow's own Jacob Kane</i>

48
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,440
<i>forged an alliance with the bat.</i>

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,760
{\an5}<i>This shocking footage

50
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,200
{\an5}<i>among Gotham citizens</i>

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,760
{\an5}<i>and a pro-Batwoman rally

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,360
{\an5}<i>in Gotham city Plaza

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,680

54
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,360
{\an5}<i>who hasn't been seen

55
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Commander

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
they're here.

57
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,280
{\an5}Time to see how long
we've been out of the loop.

58
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,040
I'm sorry. Kate was what?

59
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,560
Because that sounded
a lot like Batwoman.

60
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,400
She was your sister.
She never told you?

61
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,000
{\an5}Please. Like, Kate
would ever trust me with a secret.

62
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,520
How could you not know?

63
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,280
{\an5}You two spent nearly
every day together.

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,680
{\an5}You were her associate.

65
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
{\an5}Assistant actually

66
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,240
{\an5}and it looks like she was good

67
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,960
{\an5}at keeping secrets
from both of us.

68
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,000
We know she didn't work alone.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
Who were her other friends,
people she was close to?

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,760
{\an5}Dad, now you're just rubbing it in.

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,760
{\an5}Kate spent years
trying to push me away.

72
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,280
It's not like she was about to use
"I am Batwoman" as an icebreaker.

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
Can you think of anyone
who wanted to harm her

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,760
or Batwoman, anybody
who might have

75
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,920
sabotaged her plane?

76
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,080
I thought you said,
it was an accident.

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,800
We're not ruling anything out.

78
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,000
Just looking into any
possible enemies.

79
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,720
You mean other than every agent
in this building, right,

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,680
or maybe just the ones
that lured her into a trap,

81
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,280
tried to gun her down
on the 50-yard line.

82
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,120
You know, it's too bad
she didn't have someone who loved her

83
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,280
watching her back.

84
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,280
I think we're done here.

85
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,200
Can we just talk, please?

86
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Oh, now you got
something to say

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,280
after staying quiet for months
about who Batwoman really was?

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,880
It wasn't my secret to tell.

89
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,920
No, just your secret to keep.

90
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,200
Can't imagine Kate would trust you
with the contents of her safe

91
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,040
and not trust you
with everything else.

92
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,880
You really fooled me.

93
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,320
I guess about a lot of things.

94
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,520
Hey, you got any of this
in generic?

95
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,600
Thanks. Now do the safe.

96
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,840
Hands in the air.

97
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,720
Ryan wilder.

98
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,400
I'll note my surprise in the report.

99
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,680
Hey, Soph. Love the hair.

100
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,600
It's Agent Moore.

101
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,120
I figure we've done
this enough times

102
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,720
to be on a first-name basis.

103
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,520
You get demoted? I don't know.

104
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,000
C-store robbery seems
a little low-rent for you.

105
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,200
Funny. I was gonna say
it's a step up for you.

106
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,720
Got tired of covering for
your drug-dealing lady friend?

107
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,400
Ex-lady friend.

108
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,200
Is that why she wasn't driving
the getaway car this time?

109
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,520
I already told them
I didn't rob that place.

110
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,160
Yeah, I read that.

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,760
I also read that you were
standing over a bloody cashier

112
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,240
with your prints on the gun.

113
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,680
Because I was trying to stop it.

114
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,960
Casting yourself as the hero?
Now that's new.

115
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,280
Got the security footage.

116
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,840
Her story checks out.

117
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,080
Okay. Sorry for the mistake.

118
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,720
Yeah. The Crow's last mistake
only cost me 18 months of my life

119
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
and counting.

120
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Piece of advice.

121
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,040
If you're always
in the wrong place at the wrong time,

122
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,280
maybe you should find
a new place.

123
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,800
And tell me where that is.

124
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,320
Because by my count,
I've been brought in

125
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,000
for questioning more times
for stuff I didn't do

126
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,400
than an actual
serial killer like Alice

127
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,200
has been arrested for stuff she did.

128
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,040
You think I don't know
the real reason

129
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,520
Jacob kane won't put
a bullet in her?

130
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,680
Any sympathy he had for her died
a long time ago.

131
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,280
What are you talking about?

132
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,120
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,400
That if Alice weren't white,
she'd be dead.

134
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,160
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Ms. Wilder.

135
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
You're free to go.

136
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,160
Sympathy for that psychopath?

137
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Ryan.

138
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,160
What are you doing here?

139
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,080
Does your dad know about all this?

140
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,440
Somehow, I've managed
to keep it a secret.

141
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
Guess that's what your family does,

142
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,920
keeping secrets?

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,320
I actually pulled an all-nighter,

144
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,520
so you're gonna have
to be a little more clear.

145
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
Alice is Beth Kane, isn't she?

146
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,080
Who told you that?

147
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,160
Girl goes missing 16 years ago,
no bodies found.

148
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,040
That was Alice
before she was Alice.

149
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,880
It's complicated.

150
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,760
Because she's your sister, too.

151
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,360
I mean, does covering up
for her run in the family?

152
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,240
That bitch killed my mom.
I would never help her.

153
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,920
Alice poisoned my mom and me

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,160
and then gave us one dose
of the antidote, so...

156
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,480
My mom died in my arms.

157
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,400
Tell me where I can find her

158
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,520
and I will get justice
for both of our moms.

159
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,840
Couple homeless people
dropped him off.

160
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,000
Found him in the tunnels,

161
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,880
most of him anyway.

162
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,960
Okay, I know I'm not a doctor

163
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,160
but I am pretty sure
there is nothing you can do for him.

164
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,560
Oh, my god. It's Mouse.

165
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,560
Need a tissue?

166
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,040
Believe it or not, I'm not here
to kill you, Pennywhistle.

167
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,240
If I was, I'd just swipe left
and delete you.

168
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,920
Quite the opposite.
I'm here to save your life.

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,880
See, I'm planning something big,
high body count,

170
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,840
and it would be a shame
if one of those bodies was yours.

171
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,280
Since when do you care about my life
or any other?

172
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,520
Since our mutual enemy
killed my dear sister before I could.

173
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Safiyah?

174
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,320
Wait. You didn't actually think
Kate's plane crash

175
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,000
was a mechanical failure, did you?

176
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,920
That's not exactly Safiyah's M.O.

177
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,080
Well, Pennyroyal,

178
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,280
we all have to step outside
our comfort zones, grow, expand,

179
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,720
do things
we would normally never fathom doing,

180
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,360
which is why I'm proposing
a little supervillain,

181
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,000
superspy team-up.

182
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,560
I already have
a brilliantly terrifying plan.

183
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,920
They say revenge
is a dish best served cold,

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,400
but I think the portions
are big enough for us to split.

185
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,080
Why would I ever work
with a psychopath?

186
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,320
Because there's another psychopath
hunting you

187
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,600
who's even scarier than me...
Let's be real.

188
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,640
I'm not afraid of her.

189
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
You should be.

190
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,760
She can get you anywhere.

191
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,040
Just ask Kate.

192
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,320
Retribution is coming for both of us,
Pennyloafer.

193
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,560
If we can work together

194
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,000
and get
to that sister-killing psycho bitch

195
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,640
before she gets to us,

196
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,880
you know,
have each other's backs.

197
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,560
Yeah.
Until you stick a knife in mine.

198
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,840
Well, we could do
a couple of trust falls first.

199
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,880
Work up to the idea?

200
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
How does that sound?

201
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,600
Sounds like you're desperate.

202
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,360
Kate was the only person
who had any sympathy left for you.

203
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,560
Now that she's gone,

204
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,440
you don't have anyone.

205
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,680
Oh, you know what else
I don't have?

206
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,640
A knife sticking out of me.

207
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,480
At least it wasn't in your back.

208
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,640
So, I guess
we have two uninvited guests.

209
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,920
What the hell are you doing here?

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
At the moment, trying not to puke.

211
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,640
What kind of animal did this?

212
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,480
There's got to be
a thousand bites here.

213
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,320
All I know
is this is a bad way to go.

214
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,080
It would be, but all these bites
were post-mortem.

215
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,800
Mouse was poisoned.

216
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,680
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,

217
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,320
because it's the same toxin
that killed my mom,

218
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
and the only person
with access to it...

219
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
- Alice.
- I thought you said

220
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,240
that Mouse was Alice's,
like, only friend in the world.

221
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,160
Well, they must have
had a falling out,

222
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,040
which is more than
a little disturbing

223
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,640
given that Mouse was Alice's anchor

224
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,520
to any semblance of humanity.

225
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,120
And if she killed him,
she must really be unraveling.

226
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,120
Wait, is he still...

227
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,360
- No.
- Then how is he moving?

228
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
I don't know.

229
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,320
What? I really hate bats.

230
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,120
I'm here at Gotham City Plaza,

231
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
where citizens have gathered
to show their support for Batwoman,

232
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,800
who hasn't been seen in Gotham

233
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,280
since the Crows ambushed her
in Goliaths Stadium over a week ago,

234
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,200
<i>and despite the Crows
threatening to make arrests,</i>

235
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,000
<i>these protestors have made it clear
that they're not going anywhere.</i>

236
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,440
<i>"We want the bat!"</i>

237
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,600
So, it wasn't enough
for her to poison Mouse?

238
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
She had to feed him to bats, too?

239
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,160
Yeah, I think this is her version
of closure.

240
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Yeah, don't bet on that.

241
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,400
Julia just said Alice put
a butterfly knife into her ribs.

242
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
She'll live.

243
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,600
Not sure we can say the same
for anyone else.

244
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
What do you mean?

245
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,360
Alice told Julia
she was planning something,

246
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,600
said she used the words
"brilliant" and "terrifying,"

247
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,880
which for Alice
is pretty much redundant.

248
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,400
Didn't give a where or when

249
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,800
but said the body
count would be high.

250
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,800
Okay, so some sort of public event,

251
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,960
a densely populated area.

252
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,920
And the Goliaths aren't playing,
so it can't be the stadium.

253
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Guys.

254
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,920
Philharmonic doesn't start up
for a few weeks.

255
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,600
She's got 330 square miles
of Gotham to choose from.

256
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,080
- Guys.
- Yes?

257
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,240
I think I can narrow it down.

258
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,480
Batwoman rally.

259
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,400
<i>"We want the bat!"</i>

260
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,720
Got to admit,

261
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,280
there's a kind
of twisted poetry to killing

262
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,640
the people demanding
the return of her sister.

263
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,200
We got to get those people
out of there.

264
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,720
Listen to them.
They're not going anywhere

265
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
without Batwoman.

266
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,800
Okay, so we put Julia in the suit.

267
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,280
She's worn it before, it fits.
She can tell them all to go home.

268
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,840
I think she's too hurt.
It's not an option.

269
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
I'll do it.

270
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
No.

271
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,960
Well, I don't think you have time
to hold auditions.

272
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,080
I think people will know
you're not Batwoman.

273
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,720
I did really great my first time
in the suit.

274
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,120
Hello! Black!

275
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,600
Okay, I think that she knows that,

276
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,280
and, what, you put her
on top of a 20-story building,

277
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,080
people will be focused on the suit,
not the person in it,

278
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,640
and we're talking, what, 20 minutes?

279
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,880
You... Mary, no!

280
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,840
Well, you're out of options,
and you're out of time.

281
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,640
Put me in the suit.

282
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,000
<i>"We want the bat!"</i>

283
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,200
This is an unlawful assembly.

284
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,360
You are hereby ordered
to disperse,

285
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,240
or you risk arrest and prosecution.

286
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,840
<i>"We want the bat!"</i>

287
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,800
<i>"We want the bat!"</i>

288
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,640
We gave them a warning.

289
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Arrest them. Bus them out of here.

290
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,720
Sir, these people are here
because of Kate.

291
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,480
They want the same thing we do,

292
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,120
for her to be back.

293
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,320
<i>"We want the bat!"</i>

294
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,760
Okay. Nobody saw that.

295
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,760
Yeah. You want to use the cape
to slow your descent.

296
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,600
Things that would have been nice
to know

297
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,040
before I jumped 10 stories.

298
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,280
Nothing's stopping you from asking

299
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,760
before throwing yourself
off a building, FYI.

300
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,240
- Okay.
- Now look heroic.

301
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How's that?

302
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,480
Straighten that back
and lose the hands on the hips

303
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,640
because it's overkill.

304
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,240
Now clench those fists, chin up,

305
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,600
and now try and angle that cape so it
catches the wind.

306
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Good?

307
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,960
There she is! There she is!

308
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,440
<i>"We want the bat!"</i>

309
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Kate?

310
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,080
Get that imposter off the roof.

311
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,000
Citizens of Gotham,

312
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,360
you need to get out
of here immediately.

313
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,400
No, seriously, people,
your lives are in danger.

314
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,360
No, really, people.
I appreciate your support,

315
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,600
but you all need to return
to your homes.

316
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,280
You've got them fooled,

317
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,280
but not me.

318
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,800
I don't know who you are,
but you're not Batwoman.

319
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,280
Wait. Is that Alice?

320
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,640
<i>Ryan, talk to me.</i>

321
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,240
I'm a little busy right now.

322
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,280
Do not engage.

323
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,720
Okay, she's a killer.

324
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,960
I am well aware of that.

325
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,400
What exactly are you doing
in my sister's hand-me-downs?

326
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,280
The one thing she wouldn't do.

327
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,960
I'm gonna kill you.

328
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,600
Okay, look.
I know what she did to your mom,

329
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,400
and I get what she took
away from you,

330
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,240
but Batwoman does not kill.

331
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,360
Well, like you said,
I'm not Batwoman.

332
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,680
I cannot let you do this.

333
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,720
Don't think you're in the position
to stop me.

334
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,240
Ryan.

335
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
Ryan!

336
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
Well, the suit's for real.

337
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,480
What about the girl inside?

338
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,960
Let's find out.

339
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,560
Ryan!

340
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,680
I knew we should have never
let her near that suit.

341
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,200
Can you blame her after everything
that Alice has done?

342
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,960
You... You can't seriously
be okay with this.

343
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,640
You know what
I'm really not okay with?

344
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,320
Everybody just expecting
me to get over the fact

345
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,040
that Alice killed my mom,

346
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,720
and maybe if Kate would have done
what Ryan's trying to do,

347
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,200
she'd still be alive.

348
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,640
You willing to bet Kate's legacy
on that?

349
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,400
It's over for you.

350
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,760
On the contrary,
we're just getting started.

351
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,160
Oh, we got a problem.

352
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,200
- Care to be more specific.
- Okay. It's a big problem.

353
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,400
Radar footprint's huge.

354
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,000
Whatever it is,
it's heading straight for Ryan.

355
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,800
Was that supposed
to do something?

356
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,440
It appears we're under attack
from bats.

357
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,320
Thousands are running for cover.

358
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,120
I've never seen anything... Look out!

359
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,360
Hey, Ryan. Ryan, come in.

360
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,400
Alice used some kind of device
to draw the bats here.

361
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,440
Oh, my god.
There's freaking bats everywhere.

362
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,760
<i>You don't think these are the bats
that Alice fed Mouse to?</i>

363
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,400
And they could be the carriers
for the toxin that killed him.

364
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,400
I got to get back to the clinic.

365
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,400
I'm picking up a subsonic frequency
drawing the bats to the plaza.

366
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,600
It must be some kind of transmitter.

367
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
You got to get down there.

368
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,640
I'll be there in one minute.

369
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,000
These people don't have a minute.

370
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Ryan!

371
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Damn it!

372
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,680
I'm bringing
the suit's echolocation online.

373
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Found it.

374
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,600
Hey, guys, guys.
Come on. Get inside.

375
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
- Who are you?
- The chick who just saved your life.

376
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,680
These bats are toxic.

377
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,400
Anyone who's bitten,
get them to the hospital.

378
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
- Now, what should I do?
- Smash the damn thing.

379
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,640
No. It'll send these toxic bats
all over the city.

380
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,760
You got a better idea?

381
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,360
I might.
I just don't think either of us

382
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
is gonna like this.

383
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,280
Let's get it in there.

384
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
We got a lot more coming.

385
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,320
Just get them in here.
We'll figure it out.

386
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,440
Okay.

387
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,880
Any pain?

388
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,880
I'll take that as a yes.

389
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,040
Okay.

390
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,520
No, no, no.

391
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,320
I'll get you something
to make you more comfortable.

392
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
I think.

393
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,040
Relax, steppy.

394
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,800
I've already lost one of my sisters.
I'm not about to lose the...

395
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,440
only one I have left.

396
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,680
You really believe Kate's dead?

397
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,840
You know, better than anyone
that nobody means there's still hope.

398
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,520
I envy you, sis.

399
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,920
You still haven't kicked
hope to the curb.

400
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,600
See, she and I,
we have an understanding.

401
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,520
I stay out of hope's way,
and she stays out of mine.

402
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,240
That way, she's not there
to lie to me

403
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,040
about Kate being alive.

404
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,640
Now, while there's no hope
for our dear sister,

405
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,520
there may be for the Bat-fans.

406
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,720
You're giving me your blood?

407
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,280
Oh, no.
Actually, that's your blood.

408
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
I swiped it from you
when Nocturna tried to drain you,

409
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,680
so technically, it's a regift.

410
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,760
It's a rare vintage find...

411
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
with hints of desert rose,

412
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,120
and it's the only thing
that will treat that nasty,

413
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
little toxin.

414
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,000
Poisoning my mom wasn't enough.

415
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,160
You had to go
and poison all of Gotham, too,

416
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,640
and now, I'm just supposed to believe
that you gift wrapped the antidote?

417
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,400
I just figured I'd missed
a lot of your birthdays, so...

418
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,880
I think you miss Kate.

419
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,400
I think underneath all of your crazy,
this is your cry for help.

420
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,760
This your sick way of grieving?

421
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,640
I met the new girl.

422
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,720
This one's actually willing
to kill me.

423
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,760
She's gonna be a...

424
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Handful.

425
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,880
You got three lanes.
Try to stay in one of them.

426
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,480
Oh, give me a break.
I can barely get my van to do 40.

427
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,200
Hey. Got more coming in.

428
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,760
I heard a report
that Gotham city general's

429
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,400
got more than 250.

430
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,640
They don't know what this is
or how to treat it.

431
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,040
Guess they don't have this.

432
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,200
It's the only thing in the
world that can save them.

433
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,840
- Where'd you get it?
- From Alice.

434
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,560
You can't possibly trust her.

435
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,960
I don't think
we have a choice.

436
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,440
Even if Alice is telling the truth,

437
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,560
you can't cure all the bite victims
with just that.

438
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,680
No, I can't, but if I give it
to Hamilton Dynamics,

439
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,040
maybe they can synthesize enough
to save everyone,

440
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,560
or at least I hope they can,
but there's only one way to find out.

441
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,720
I got a vacant warehouse
off the Schwartz bypass, 2.3 miles.

442
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,560
No. Not enough time.
I need something closer.

443
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Okay.

444
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,600
There's a decommissioned
subway station at needer avenue,

445
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,760
- should be empty.
- No, no, no.

446
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,920
That's a homeless encampment.
There's people down there.

447
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,160
Okay, okay. Working on it.

448
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,480
No, rush.

449
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,600
Luke, I might have an idea.

450
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Talk to me.

451
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,000
Probably better if I ask
for forgiveness than for permission.

452
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,680
Ryan, what are you doing?

453
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Wish I knew.

454
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,360
Hey!
What are you doing?

455
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,240
- Get off the bus now!
- No.

456
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
Please.

457
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,280
- Come on.
- Are you kidding me?

458
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,520
What, are you crazy?

459
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,360
Get down!

460
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,400
Batwoman?

461
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,880
Oh, no, no. I'm not really Batwoman.

462
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,520
Well, you are to me.

463
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,000
- If you...
- After a night of terror,

464
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,640
hope has returned to Gotham,

465
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,720
and it's arrived on the back
of a Hamilton Dynamics truck.

466
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,360
Thanks to the quick action taken
by the technology firm,

467
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,160
<i>everyone infected
is receiving treatment.</i>

468
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,120
<i>The lines are long, and frankly,
so is the needle.</i>

469
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,720
<i>Hamilton dynamics
is remaining tight-lipped</i>

470
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,520
<i>on how they were able
to generate a serum so quickly,</i>

471
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,400
<i>but we're all certainly glad
they did.</i>

472
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,160
<i>- As for the swarm...</i>
- I mean, a little credit

473
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,280
would have been nice.

474
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,520
All I did
was give you your magic ingredient

475
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
for your miracle cure,

476
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,200
but you do you,
Hamilton dynamics.

477
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,960
What's Alice's play here?

478
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,080
Good deeds aren't her thing,
and I think we both know

479
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,640
she didn't just grow a conscience.

480
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,080
She went through a lot of trouble

481
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,280
to unleash a plague
onto an entire city

482
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,520
only to play ninth inning Jonas Salk.

483
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,000
She's too cunning and calculating.

484
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,040
This is part of something bigger.

485
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,960
If this is the opener,

486
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,840
I don't think we're ready
for the main event.

487
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,720
Me neither.
I just hope the new Batwoman is.

488
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,800
Me, too.

489
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,000
What do you know
about the new Batwoman?

490
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,160
Do you know who she is?

491
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,440
For the record, no,
but short of a name,

492
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,720
is there any answer
I could give you that you'd believe?

493
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Probably not.

494
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,480
Well, maybe I can give you
a consolation prize,

495
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,440
a possible location on Alice.

496
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,280
I had them analyze
the floor mats on my SUV

497
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,000
after my little chat with Alice.

498
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Turns out her boots left behind
traces of triethyl benzene,

499
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,600
a byproduct
of tire manufacturing.

500
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,640
I'm guessing
she's holed up somewhere near

501
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,640
the Dresner motor plant.

502
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Good.

503
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,280
Let's keep this between us.
Backup will just scare her off.

504
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,360
Did she say she loved you?

505
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,200
In the letter,
did Kate say she loved you?

506
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,920
What does it matter?

507
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,960
I just want to know if we're over
because you don't trust me

508
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,480
or because I'm not Kate.

509
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Both.

510
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,040
So, what, you didn't ask me
enough questions the first time?

511
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,960
You gonna break out the waterboard?

512
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
Look.

513
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,560
I know I hauled you in here

514
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,400
and interrogated you
like some suspect,

515
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,040
and I'm sorry about that.

516
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,080
I'm trying.

517
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
I am.

518
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,360
I just don't want to make
the same mistakes

519
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,840
that I made with Beth.

520
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,040
I don't want to give up hope
that Kate's alive.

521
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,080
You believe she's still alive,
don't you?

522
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,440
I... I think that
if we're gonna find her

523
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,520
you and I have to work together.

524
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,920
I didn't know
the whole dry- cleaning situation,

525
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,520
but I think that burnt bat smell
is here to stay.

526
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,360
And I was kind of hoping
I could be, too.

527
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,800
I appreciate everything you did.

528
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,160
But saving
a whole bunch of lives twice

529
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,800
- isn't good enough?
- We already have a Batwoman.

530
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,080
Where was she last night?

531
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,080
Best thing that ever happened to me
was the day mama Cora found me.

532
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,160
Second best thing
was the day I found that suit,

533
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,440
but I can't help but to feel
like that suit found me.

534
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,800
This city needs hope, Luke.

535
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,600
Hell, we all need it,
and I saw it today

536
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,880
in the face of a young girl

537
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,680
who's been told her entire life
that hope doesn't exist.

538
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,680
Give me a chance,

539
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,800
and I can bring
that hope back to Gotham.

540
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Look. Kate Kane

541
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,600
was top of her class at one
of the most elite military academies

542
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,800
in the world,

543
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,480
and she still struggled
to take down criminals.

544
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,480
Maybe she didn't spend
enough time with them.

545
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,160
I have been trapped
in a life surrounded by criminals.

546
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,160
I know how they think, how they act,

547
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,280
but most of all,
I know how to stop them.

548
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,200
I hope you're right

549
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,200
because if Alice
is planning something big,

550
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,000
then the city's gonna need
a Batwoman,

551
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,080
and honestly, so do I.

552
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,680
Batwoman...

553
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,240
Has a code.

554
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,840
No, killing.

555
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,960
Fine.

556
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,760
Until Kate's back.

557
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Come on.

558
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,480
I'll show you around.

559
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,680
It's my first time giving the tour.

560
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,240
<i>Greetings, G-town.
So, how was your night?</i>

561
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,480
<i>In what could have been
a real Batastrophe,</i>

562
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,200
<i>victory was pulled
from the tiny jaws of defeat</i>

563
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,400
<i>by our returning champion Batwoman,</i>

564
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,600
<i>but some eyewitnesses report
that last night's heroics</i>

565
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,000
<i>were courtesy of a new lady bat.</i>

566
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,520
<i>Is this true? Did the old one
just throw in the cowl?</i>

567
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,120
<i>What's going on here?
Talk to me, Gotham.</i>

568
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,280
<i>Dear Bruce, Happy Halloween.</i>

569
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,280
<i>A few tricks, one nice treat.</i>

570
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,800
<i>Tonight, I saw a girl
who reminded me of myself.</i>

571
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,040
<i>Scared but fearless.</i>

572
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
<i>Determined not to let
the darkness of Gotham</i>

573
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,280
<i>get the best of her.</i>

574
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,160
<i>People like her are
the hope this city needs.</i>

575
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,160
I've never looked good in red.

576
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
Put them on.

577
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,240
Behind your back.

578
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,840
She's mine.

579
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,640
The Desert Rose
was not meant for Gotham,

580
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,080
and now your little stunt
with that miracle cure

581
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,840
has drawn Safiyah's Wrath.

582
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,080
Well, that was
what I intended, so...

583
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,640
Stupid girl.

584
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,640
My dear, sweet Tatiana,

585
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,040
if you were sent here to kill me,

586
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,640
my head would already be
in your carry-on

587
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,480
on the way back to Coryana.

588
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,640
Safiyah will see you die for this.

589
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,160
Maybe, but first, she has to see me.
