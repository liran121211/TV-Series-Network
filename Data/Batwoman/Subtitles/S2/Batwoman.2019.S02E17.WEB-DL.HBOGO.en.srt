1
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,640
I'm looking for a missing woman
brunette, high cheek bones

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,240
looks an awful lot like
your cover girl over there.

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,600
I... I don't know.

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,680
Well, what about
your boss Roman Sionis?

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,200
Sometimes likes to side
hustle as Black Mask.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,560
I'm just a security guard.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,280
Machine pistol. It's a little rich
for a rent-a-cop.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,760
Yeah, but the ammo is
standard issue False Face.

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,320
Now, you want to tell me
what I want to know

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,080
or do we need to find out
if your boss tests

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,040
- his products on animals?
- I ain't telling you anything.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
"Rekindle".

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,000
Does it hurt as bad as it smells?

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,600
Let's try...

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Remember.

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,880
Now... You want to
find out what I can do

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,760
- with a mascara wand?
- All right, all right!

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,760
All I know is he's gone underground.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,400
- What about his daughter?
- I don't know.

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
You got to believe me.

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,680
- And you believed him?
- What did you want me to do, go

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,040
through the entire product line?

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,400
Am I the only one who
can smell me right now?

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,920
We're getting no signs
of Kate on traffic cams

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,160
and facial recognition
is not getting any hits.

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,040
None of the hospitals in 20 miles

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,880
have admitted Kate,
Circe, or any Jane Doe

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,040
matching that description.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,440
Okay. How long since
she wandered off?

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,000
- Ten hours?
- Long time, especially in Gotham.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,760
So what do we do, just
sit around and wait?

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,520
- Anything?
- Just a belligerent drunk

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,440
at the Hold-Up acting
like they own the place.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,600
Hey!

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Come on!

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,800
We got a dead soldier.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,720
Yeah. So that drunk acting
like she owns the place?

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,960
- Turns out she does.
- Another one?

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,640
All that Bat-tech and the one place

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,080
{\an5}we didn't look was inside
of a tequila bottle.

41
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,600
Water by the nightstand.

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,440
{\an5}Trashcan by the bed.

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,920
{\an5}Head tilted to the side.

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Mary...

45
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,840
You remember.

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,960
{\an5}How do we know each other again?

47
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Okay.

48
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,240
Baby steps.

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,640
- How's she doing?
- Sleeping.

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
For now anyway,

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,360
{\an5}but we got her back, so yeah!

52
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,120
Definite yeah.

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,760
{\an5}Guys, she went from attacking Mary

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
{\an5}to ditching Sophie to treating half

55
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,720
the lesbians in Gotham
to an open bar.

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,400
{\an5}Is anyone else worried about what
she's gonna do when she wakes up?

57
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,640
{\an5}Well, if I found out
my memory had been wiped

58
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,000
{\an5}and then reprogrammed
into a dead supermodel

59
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,400
{\an5}I'd go on a 12-hour bar crawl too.

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,640
I mean, if we're freaked, imagine
what it must be like for her.

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,880
She needs time.

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,560
{\an5}And I hate to admit it,

63
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,360
{\an5}but maybe my dad was right.

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,960
{\an5}What Kate needs is her sister.

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
{\an5}The other one.

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,440
Please don't leave me.

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Stay with me.

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Oh, my God.

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Fix him.

70
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,400
- Alice, he's gone.
- No, he's not.

71
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,360
{\an5}There's nothing I can do.

72
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,880
{\an5}Save his life, or yours is over!

73
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,160
{\an5}That won't bring Ocean back.

74
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,720
{\an5}I know how this feels.

75
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,760
{\an5}That unbearable pain

76
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
{\an5}and numb emptiness all at once

77
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,920
{\an5}like you're watching it all
from a million miles away,

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
but it's happening
right in front of you.

79
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
I know.

80
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,160
{\an5}You're the reason I know.

81
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,280
{\an5}Is that why you're here...

82
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,840
To gloat?

83
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
No.

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,880
I wouldn't wish this on anyone.

85
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,120
Not even you.

86
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,680
Then why are you here?

87
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,440
It's about Kate.

88
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,680
She's fine. She's doing great.

89
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
I just...

90
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,120
I just came to thank you...

91
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,520
For saving her.

92
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,440
Look at what it's cost me.

93
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,360
I should have left
with him when I had the chance.

94
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
What's going on?

95
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,880
Well, I figured if Kate's got
a few gaps in her memory

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,280
maybe she could use an old-school
backup to reboot from.

97
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,200
I think it's more than
just a few gaps

98
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
in her memory, Luke.

99
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,560
What are you saying?

100
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,680
Kate's not okay
and we can't rush this.

101
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,200
She's been through
unimaginable trauma.

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,280
A deranged shrink hypnotized her

103
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,680
into believing a masked
supervillain was her dad

104
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,600
and the person in charge
of her recovery was Alice

105
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
and that's just the stuff
we know about.

106
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,720
Well, I know Kate. I mean,
she survived gas attacks

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,040
a bomb-throwing bird, a chick
who thought she was a vampire.

108
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,400
She'll survive this.

109
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,200
You don't have to convince me.
I read those journals, too.

110
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,760
Then you know how resilient she is.

111
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,200
She has never backed
down from a fight ever.

112
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,240
Then we'll be lucky to have her back.

113
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
That's right.

114
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,680
This your way of telling me
we were in a book club together?

115
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,240
See? You still remember
how to be a smartass.

116
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,320
I never realized how much
I miss that.

117
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,720
Yeah. You kept journals,
like, meticulously.

118
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,720
I thought it could trigger
some memories,

119
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,960
your own voice, your own handwriting.

120
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,280
Maybe reading about who you were

121
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,640
will remind you of who you are.

122
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,640
It, it's no beach read, but...

123
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,520
Good because I seem to
remember not liking the beach.

124
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,080
Then you're making progress.

125
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,280
And I'm starting
to remember why we were friends.

126
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes. Just friends.

127
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,200
And what kind of friend would I be

128
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,040
if I didn't bring you
something a little more fun

129
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,320
than some dusty, old books
to help kickstart your memories?

130
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
That is...

131
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,400
Unless you forgot how to ride.

132
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Hi, Dad.

133
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
How's the hand?

134
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm more concerned
about you, sweetheart.

135
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,440
- How are you feeling?
- Grateful actually to you

136
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,360
for saving me from a life
of Kate Kane.

137
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,040
Concert tees and single earrings?

138
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,320
She should wear
a size two wet blanket.

139
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,680
It would be more on brand.

140
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,880
Her bar is cool, though.

141
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,480
Can I have it when we're done?

142
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll make sure it's still standing
when we're finished.

143
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,520
Here. These should help us
get started.

144
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,440
Turns out Kate Kane had a thing
for putting her feels on paper.

145
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,520
If you can suffer through all

146
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,160
the "Dear diary, being
Batwoman is so hard"

147
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,080
it's basically a user manual
for the Batcave.

148
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,640
Well done, my dear.

149
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,640
And once I have everything I need
to give me back my island,

150
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,360
you have my blessing
to bring this one to its knees.

151
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,240
Yeah. You are coming too.

152
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Hello?

153
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Hey, Ryan.

154
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,480
You were hoping I'd be Kate.

155
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,520
- No. I mean...
- Come on.

156
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not thinking all of this
is for me.

157
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,120
Pretty sure I know what memories
you're trying to jog.

158
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,200
All right. All right. You got me.

159
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,640
So you, Kate and Batwoman 1.0.

160
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
That's a pretty drama-filled
love triangle.

161
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
Well, if there's some parts
of our history

162
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,880
she doesn't remember,
it might not be the worst thing.

163
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,640
So, where do you two go from here?

164
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,240
Looks like I could ask
you the same thing.

165
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,880
If Kate's gonna get her life back,
she should have her loft back, too.

166
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,680
Look. If you need a place to crash,

167
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,400
I've got a surprisingly
comfortable pull-out couch.

168
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,200
Thanks, but I got a place lined up.

169
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,040
It's a little small, but it's got
a killer view of the river.

170
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,080
Girl, you know just
because Kate's returned

171
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,720
it doesn't mean you have
to give everything back.

172
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,000
The suit's hers.
I was just keeping it warm for her.

173
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,520
You made the suit your own
just like you made Batwoman your own

174
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,360
and you've proven yourself
to every single person in Gotham.

175
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,480
There's one person
I haven't proven myself to

176
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,120
and she's the only other person
who knows what this job takes.

177
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,120
Kate will be so proud
of what you've done.

178
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,480
Like letting Black Mask
take over the city

179
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,680
and now he's superteaming
with Safiyah?

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,840
Yeah. Well, not to pile on

181
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,680
but you can add recruiting
ex-Crows to that mix.

182
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,160
Word on the street is
he's offering top dollar.

183
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,680
Every one of you
signed up to protect this city

184
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,920
with a noble purpose in your hearts

185
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,800
and what did you get in return?

186
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,320
Your hands tied
by corrupt politicians

187
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,720
who care more about
some criminal's rights

188
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,400
than what is right,

189
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,920
a system more concerned
with the red tape

190
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,520
than the red blood running
through our streets.

191
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,000
The people you're there
to defend would rather defund.

192
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,120
Well, I'm here to pick up the tab.

193
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm gonna give you the tools you need

194
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,520
and the free rein to use them

195
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,280
so what do you say?

196
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,360
Who wants to take off the gloves...

197
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,760
And put on the mask?

198
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
Yeah!

199
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
Help yourselves, gentlemen.

200
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
Not a big fan of the speech?

201
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,000
I worked on it all night.

202
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,800
Just can't shake the suspicion

203
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
that I'm the same cog
in a different machine.

204
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,880
First Jacob Kane's, now yours.

205
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,160
What's the difference?
What's in this for me?

206
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,280
You don't want to be a cog?
I respect that.

207
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,080
What if I told you...

208
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,400
You could be the machine?

209
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,920
- Hello! Still working here.
<i>- I know,</i>

210
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
<i>and I know who you're working for.</i>

211
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,280
<i>Yeah. Those False Face guys
downstairs</i>

212
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,520
<i>aren't gonna be helping you.</i>

213
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,680
- What do you want?
<i>- To follow the money.</i>

214
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,560
<i>I hear your boss has been
putting ex-Crows on the payroll.</i>

215
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,400
I'm not telling you anything.

216
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
<i>You don't have to.</i>

217
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,880
Anybody an expert in QuickBooks?

218
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,600
Because somebody's got
Black Mask by the piggy bank.

219
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Hello?

220
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,240
<i>Hangover aside</i>

221
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,440
<i>it sure felt nice to be back
in my old bed again</i>

222
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,440
<i>and back behind my old desk.</i>

223
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,000
<i>After everything that's happened</i>

224
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,640
<i>I just can't believe
you're sitting right here.</i>

225
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,480
<i>You know where I can't wait to be?</i>

226
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,960
<i>Out there in the suit,
protecting Gotham again.</i>

227
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,680
Well, Mama.
Back where we started.

228
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,760
You'd think by now
I'd be used to having

229
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,800
the good things that happen
to me getting taken away.

230
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
You...

231
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
Plant you...

232
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,400
And now the Bat.

233
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,840
I know what you're gonna say.

234
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,720
Maybe the reason I kept saying Kate
wasn't ready is because...

235
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,440
I wasn't ready to leave.

236
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,120
And you'd also tell me make the most
of what time you have left.

237
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,040
Message received, Mama.

238
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,720
Okay, Black Mask.

239
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,040
Let's see where you've been spending
all of that Snakebite money

240
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,840
because it looks like
you are trying to buy a damn army.

241
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,920
- Hands where I can see them!
- What the hell is this?

242
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,640
Get off of me!

243
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,600
Hey. Get your damn hands off my
stuff!

244
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,840
I don't think this is your stuff.

245
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,760
But I'm thinking these
are definitely yours.

246
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,080
Look like Snakebite injectors to me.

247
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,080
- You guys planted that.
- That's what they all say.

248
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
Get her out of here.

249
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,040
Hi.

250
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,360
Good-bye, my love.

251
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,160
Earth to earth...

252
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,080
Ashes to ashes...

253
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,120
Dust to dust...

254
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,680
Ocean to ocean.

255
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
I've come to pay my respects.

256
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,680
Ryan Wilder.

257
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,280
Or should I call you Batwoman?

258
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Depends.

259
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,440
Should I call you Roman Sionis
or Black Mask?

260
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,960
I have to admit, I was surprised
to find out the caped crusader

261
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,440
was nine-to-five-ing it as a barkeep.

262
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,600
And I was surprised
to find out that Gotham's

263
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,840
latest supervillain
was a cosmetics mogul.

264
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,960
Mary Kay joining your legion of doom?

265
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,200
No. I am merely a concerned citizen

266
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,480
trying to restore justice
to a lawless city like you.

267
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,360
We are nothing alike.

268
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,240
We both wear masks
to avenge the wrongs

269
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,440
perpetrated against us.

270
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,640
I must say I feel
that given the right push

271
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,840
together we could give
this city its soul back.

272
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah and all I have
to do is give up mine.

273
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,040
Well, now you're just being selfish.

274
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,680
Why should you be
the only masked vigilante

275
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,440
who gets to be the arbiter
of justice?

276
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,080
Why shouldn't everyone
have the same opportunity?

277
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,720
After all, it feels good, doesn't it?

278
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,800
It does. It feels good to fight
for people who are powerless,

279
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,720
people trapped by a broken system,

280
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,200
people like your daughter.

281
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,760
I know what happened to her

282
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,880
how she was assaulted

283
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,320
how the Crows covered it up

284
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,880
made her look crazy,
then threw her in Arkham

285
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,680
- where she suffered and died.
- Where she was murdered.

286
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,640
You know what? Maybe we do
have something in common

287
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
because...

288
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,160
I know that rage you feel

289
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,600
the need to make someone pay

290
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,040
but using her to justify
what you're doing

291
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,800
is dishonoring her memory.

292
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,920
I don't put much stock in the words
of a repeat drug offender.

293
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,800
Neither do judges for that matter

294
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,800
not that you're going to live
to see one.

295
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,960
No hard feelings, Wilder

296
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,440
but I can't have
you getting in my way.

297
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,120
Good-bye, Batwoman.

298
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,920
Arrested? For what?

299
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,960
Possession of drug paraphernalia
with intent to distribute.

300
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,440
- Snakebite injectors.
- So she was set up.

301
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,160
We need to have all
hands on deck for this.

302
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
Where's Kate right now?

303
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,840
<i>"I'm telling you this because I know
you'll figure it out eventually</i>

304
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,040
<i>and I want you
to know that lying to you</i>

305
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,720
<i>was the hardest thing I've ever done,
but I lied because..."</i>

306
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,240
"I love you".

307
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,440
So there's that.

308
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,800
And I don't know if you
remember writing that

309
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,200
or even feeing it, but...

310
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,040
But there's not a day that went by

311
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,600
that I didn't read your letter.

312
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,760
I guess I thought we'd have
all the time in the world

313
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,040
for me to tell you
everything that I felt, but...

314
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
Then suddenly our time was up

315
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,200
and all I had was that letter
with all of your feelings

316
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,640
and no time left to tell you mine.

317
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,320
And now, I'm thinking I should
have taken a little more time

318
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
- before laying all this on you.
- No.

319
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
No.

320
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,120
I'm just glad I don't have
to lie to you anymore.

321
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,040
Ryan's been arrested.

322
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,560
Hey. How the hell does
Roman know Ryan is Batwoman?

323
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,400
Ryan didn't say.
Probably because she was so focused

324
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
on using her one phone call

325
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,800
to warn us he was gonna
have her killed.

326
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,520
- Where is she now?
- Ryan's being held

327
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,520
in a secure holding area
at the Gotham City Courthouse.

328
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,480
Cell phone pings show
50-plus cops in that area,

329
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,640
but we don't know who's on
Black Mask's payroll and who isn't.

330
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,560
All it takes is one to make sure
Ryan dies in custody.

331
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,760
Then they make up any story
they want after that.

332
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,600
It's not gonna be an
easy extraction, okay?

333
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,320
It's gonna be hard to tell the
friendlies from the unfriendlies.

334
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,240
I think your old cowl's
around here somewhere

335
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,320
but I hope you weren't kidding

336
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,280
when you said you
wanted to suit up again.

337
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,640
Ryan risked everything
to save my life.

338
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,880
How can I not do the same?

339
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
Actually, it's we.

340
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,240
I'm going with you.

341
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,680
I just got you back.
I'm not losing you again.

342
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,960
That is so sweet.

343
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
I'll take the Batbike,
you take the U-Haul.

344
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
What?

345
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
No!

346
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,000
I want you to know that lying to you

347
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,200
was the easiest thing
I've ever done.

348
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Unbelievable.

349
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,480
You were less than one week away
from your parole board review.

350
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,640
I was gonna recommend
you be discharged

351
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,240
from supervised release.

352
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,400
You were this close to putting
your past mistakes behind you

353
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,760
and then you get caught
with Snakebite injectors?

354
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
They were not mine.

355
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,880
Well, that sounds familiar?

356
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,760
Last time, they weren't yours either,

357
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,600
only now you've added
intent to distribute

358
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,400
and violation of your parole
to the possession charge.

359
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,520
We're talking real time, Ryan.

360
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,080
Do you have any idea how
absolutely screwed you are?

361
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Yes...

362
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
But I don't think you do.

363
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,880
I have been set up.

364
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,840
- Right. Really? By who? The GCPD?
- No. Black Mask, who owns the GCPD

365
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,080
and they are trying to kill me.

366
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,920
Okay. So I'm guessing they
didn't find any Snakebite

367
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,840
because you got high on it.

368
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Trust me.

369
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,600
I am not going to make it out
of this building alive.

370
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Okay.

371
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Fine.

372
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,760
Indulging this paranoid fantasy

373
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,440
because apparently
that's what I do now.

374
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,120
Why would one of Gotham's
worst criminal masterminds

375
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,640
want to target you?

376
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,600
Because I'm Batwoman.

377
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,680
Ryan, you can't expect me
to believe any of this!

378
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,080
You saw that six-man SWAT team
that brought me in here.

379
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,960
You saw how many guards
are waiting outside.

380
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,880
You saw all of
that firepower for a bag full

381
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,840
of empty Snakebite injectors.

382
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,080
Now, I need you to see me.

383
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Stand up.

384
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,120
Do you see me?

385
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Hold on!

386
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,000
I need to speak with Judge Hamada.

387
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,920
I have reason to believe my parolee
is being railroaded.

388
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,520
What the hell
is going on in there?

389
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,760
- Damn it.
- Wait!

390
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
You're gonna need this.

391
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,560
It'll get you out of
the parking garage exit

392
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
if you hurry.

393
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Thank you.

394
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,240
Not just for this
but for believing me.

395
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Anytime...

396
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,200
Batwoman.

397
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,680
No royal guard
to accompany the queen.

398
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,840
I'd love to meet Tatiana's
replacement.

399
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,000
I've known
where you are at all times.

400
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
If I wanted you dead,
I would have tasked

401
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,160
the men who tracked
you here to do it.

402
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,000
So you came alone.
Well, that's gutsy.

403
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,600
You wouldn't dare kill me.

404
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,360
Besides, that would be no fun
for you.

405
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
Even after you killed my Ocean!

406
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,640
His death, however tragic,
was a necessary sacrifice.

407
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,800
He wasn't one of your
island hippies, you wench!

408
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,400
You said you loved him
like a brother.

409
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,080
And I've taken him
from you just the way

410
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,120
you took the thing I loved most

411
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,520
the Desert Rose.

412
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,920
Now, we are even.

413
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,160
Let this war between us die
with Ocean

414
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,320
before you join him.

415
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,960
So much for the war ending

416
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,360
because that sounded an awful lot
like you threatening to kill me.

417
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,720
My dear...

418
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,800
- I'm here to save you.
- From what?

419
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,840
A yummy, daddy-approved boyfriend?

420
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,880
From the thing you fear most...

421
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,760
Spending the rest
of your days locked in a cage.

422
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,440
A storm is coming for Gotham

423
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,520
and only one place
you can seek shelter.

424
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,040
There she is.

425
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,360
And where's that?

426
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,760
Coming down off of
a haloperidol bender

427
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,040
courtesy of this little guy.

428
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,080
Other side effects,
you can look forward to

429
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,360
include confusion, nausea...

430
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,800
And hopefully not vomiting

431
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
because we're stuck in here.

432
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,040
Kate... Circe... Whatever
the hell we call her...

433
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,440
Really did a number on this thing.

434
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,240
- She was playing us the whole time.
- Yeah.

435
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,200
We were so desperate
to have her back

436
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
we fell for it.

437
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,320
Pretty sure pouring your heart out
to a sleeper agent has that beat.

438
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
But...

439
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,800
She could have
killed us and she didn't.

440
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,960
Maybe there's still some
Kate left in there.

441
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,040
Or maybe just enough
to give the keys to the castle.

442
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,960
You know, I know we're
excited about Kate being back

443
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,680
but I really could have
used a helping hand.

444
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,840
So could we!

445
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,120
What the hell happened?

446
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,120
Remember when I said
I know Kate better than you do?

447
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,400
Only works if it's really Kate.

448
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,560
It was Circe
pretending the whole time.

449
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,840
- So, where is she now?
- No idea.

450
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Okay.

451
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,640
Okay. I'm gonna have
to cut through it.

452
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,960
Where the hell are the weapons?

453
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
There's one.

454
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,360
You have the coolest toys.

455
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,480
And here I was thinking
I was the girl who had everything.

456
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,160
I guess now I do.

457
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,080
Running away. How heroic.

458
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,800
Come back with me.

459
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Come home.

460
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,720
You want me to come back
to Coryana with you?

461
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,000
Well, that depends.

462
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,440
Do you have any non-smoking
rooms available?

463
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,320
No, because I'm pretty
sure that I turned

464
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,520
your little island into
an all-inclusive ashtray.

465
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Not for much longer.

466
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,240
Coryana will soon be abloom
with Desert Rose once more

467
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,760
thanks to a small cutting
from one of Poison Ivy's vines.

468
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,560
Its rather aggressive growth
properties

469
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,080
will soon turn my one
rose into thousands.

470
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,720
Poison Ivy?

471
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,720
Didn't know you had the green
thumb girl on speed dial.

472
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,200
I don't. I simply struck
a gentlewoman's agreement

473
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,160
with a new friend
to procure it for me.

474
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,440
You see, she was all
too eager to help me

475
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,600
once I had a sword driven through
the powerful man who had wronged her

476
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,000
along with the men
who condemned her to Arkham

477
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,440
where she was trampled.

478
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,200
Circe Sionis.

479
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,120
You didn't really think you'd
gotten your sister back, did you?

480
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,960
If you're not gonna give me
something to shoot at

481
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,480
I'm gonna have to improvise.

482
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,320
Kate, I know that there's still
a small part of you in there

483
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,200
that doesn't want to kill us!

484
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,680
Unfortunately,
but that small part of me

485
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,160
is not my trigger finger.

486
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm really getting
the hang of this now.

487
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,120
Then again, it is just like shooting

488
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,400
at sad, needy, pathetic
fish in a barrel.

489
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,240
This nose cost more
than everything in here.

490
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,160
It's not your nose. Otherwise,
I would have broken it.

491
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,520
Don't pull your
punches on my account.

492
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,920
I know I won't.

493
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,920
This is why Gucci made belts
and not lassos.

494
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,360
Hey. These gonna be strong enough?

495
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,000
They're titanium. Let's find out.

496
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,240
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

497
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,920
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah. Come on.

498
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Let her go!

499
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,280
Don't do this.

500
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,760
You're not gonna shoot me.

501
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,040
Because you love me.

502
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,200
Ryan, don't feel bad.

503
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,400
Kate wasn't strong enough
to be me either.

504
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
You have nothing.

505
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,280
No boyfriend, no sister.

506
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,640
I'm all you have left
except for enemies.

507
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,640
Soon, Gotham will
offer you no sanctuary.

508
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
But you will?

509
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,120
Of course, my dear.

510
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,880
Who else is going to protect you?

511
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,720
Who else is going to love you?

512
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,360
You're all alone. You have no family
other than me.

513
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
I know.

514
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,360
Because you took them from me.

515
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,720
And I'll remove
your Desert Rose dagger

516
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,400
once I get them back

517
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,200
and then we'll talk.

518
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,120
But you're right.

519
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,200
Killing you...

520
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,360
That would be no fun.

521
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,320
But making you suffer...

522
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,920
Now, that's a different story.

523
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,240
Radiation gauges,
biohazard level three?

524
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,920
What is this place?

525
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,120
Well, it was where
Bruce kept the weapons

526
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,160
and other bad stuff he confiscated
from all the villains he took down.

527
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,000
And now Circe has them.

528
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,440
Look, Ryan. I'm sorry.

529
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,640
You warned us not to rush things

530
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,160
and we all just wanted
Kate back so bad

531
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,520
we just didn't question it

532
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,480
but you did.

533
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,800
It doesn't matter now.

534
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,720
She has WMDs, the Batbike

535
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,120
my suit, my weapons.

536
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,280
Look. I know it's bad

537
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,240
but we'll figure it out.

538
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,320
We always do.

539
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,720
I hope you're right, Mary

540
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,160
because if I'm being honest...

541
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,080
I'm scared as hell.

542
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,280
Joker's acid flower.

543
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,000
Clayface's mud, Killer Croc's tooth.

544
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,840
Why you collecting all this stuff
from Batman's enemies?

545
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,200
So I can succeed where they failed.

546
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,440
Shall we get started?
