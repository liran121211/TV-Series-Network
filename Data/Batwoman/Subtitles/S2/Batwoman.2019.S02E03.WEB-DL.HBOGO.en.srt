1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,640
<i>He'll want to get this
into play quickly.</i>

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,280
<i>And he does,
then moves it quickly up the field.</i>

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,400
<i>They're gonna need to play
a far more attacking game...</i>

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,640
Mr. Capalaci.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,320
You order something, sweetie?

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,400
Champagne, sir.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,920
We didn't order champagne.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,920
No. Your wife back home did.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,200
She sends her love.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
<i>Olé!</i>

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,080
You know, if he really cared,

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,120
he'd have sprung
for the soaking tub for two.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
No!

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,760
Now, Mrs. Capalaci,

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,360
now there's a woman
who spares no expense.

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,160
I am not cheap,

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,280
and there are plenty of reasonably
priced hit persons available

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,520
to handle a perfidious husband
and his sudsy paramour.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,760
This is a Brute Millesime.

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,040
Now, I could have just as easily

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,440
picked up a bottle
of the cheap stuff,

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,320
but Mrs. Capalaci
insisted on the finer vintage

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,040
because she wanted you to know

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,160
that she was willing
to spend more on you

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,560
than her husband was.

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,400
No, no!

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,760
Are you kidding me?

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,120
Well, look at who's getting
close to retirement.

29
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,040
Victor Zsasz at your service.

30
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,240
- I'm looking for Snakebite.
- Get lost.

31
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,760
Seen too much of you lately.

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,320
Tweakers bring heat.

33
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,520
There's nothing like this out there.

34
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,840
Go easy.

35
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,760
Seriously?

36
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,160
That would have been a 10
if you stuck the landing.

37
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,360
I would have stuck the landing
if the boots actually fit.

38
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,160
You know we don't have
an inexhaustible supply

39
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
of those, right?

40
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,160
About a grand apiece.
We're at about four grand now?

41
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,480
Worth it.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,880
The suit's bulletproof, dumbass.

43
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Who are you?

44
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Batwoman.

45
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,840
No. You ain't Batwoman.

46
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,440
Is that so?

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
Luke, I need a good comeback.

48
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Luke?

49
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,360
Sorry. Nothing's coming.

50
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,480
Are you, are you beeping?

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,960
What is that? Is that an alarm?

52
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,080
Tag in the GCPD. I got to go.

53
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,000
You got somewhere else
you need to be?

54
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,560
- Not late.
- No.

55
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,440
{\an5}You had a comfortable
12-second cushion

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,040
{\an5}before I would have had
to revoke your parole

57
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
for missing your appointment.

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,560
{\an5}I assume this means
you have a day job now.

59
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,560
Good morning, Gotham.

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm looking at a very distant,
very fuzzy photo

61
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,640
from the other night's
Batwoman rally

62
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,360
and dumb question.

63
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,240
Did we get a new Batwoman?

64
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,520
Dumber question. Is she black?

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,240
Don't get me wrong.
I'm all about the representation

66
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,520
in G-town, but did I miss something?

67
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,480
{\an5}So, it looks like you're due
for a CT scan,

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
{\an5}see how the cancer
is taking to the chemo.

69
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,120
Any new pain?

70
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,720
Not too much, no.

71
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
I'm actually feeling pretty energetic.

72
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,120
- That's great.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

73
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,480
Your phone is about to ring,
and the answer is yes.

74
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
Roxanne, will you excuse me?

75
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,680
{\an5}Hey, Amy. Can you help
Roxanne to the lab?

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,280
{\an5}- Yeah.
- Thank you.

77
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,560
{\an5}Come. What are you doing here?

78
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,360
{\an5}- I'm in the middle of a consul...
- I'm so sorry. I just...

79
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,800
{\an5}Mary Hamilton.

80
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,800
Yes, I am the current owner
of the hold-up.

81
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,760
{\an5}Ryan Wilder's parole officer. Okay.

82
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Hi.

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,840
{\an5}Did I just hire Ryan
for a bartending position?

84
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,960
{\an5}Yes. Yes. I was very impressed

85
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,680
by her fruit slicing abilities.

86
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,440
Yeah. Okay. Talk to you soon.

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,600
{\an5}Since when can parolees
work at a bar?

88
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,680
{\an5}She is making an exception
because I can't get a job.

89
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,920
{\an5}Well, this is perfect

90
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,880
{\an5}because working at the hold-up
will detract people

91
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,640
{\an5}from thinking you're you know who

92
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,520
{\an5}and it'll explain why
we'll be hanging out together

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,680
all the time.

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,520
All the time?

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,800
{\an5}Luke said I'm only keeping
the suit warm till Kate gets back.

96
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,560
{\an5}You make it seem like she's not.

97
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,840
Which one is it?

98
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,040
I have to get back to my patients.

99
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,680
I'll call the bar manager
and let her know

100
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,160
{\an5}you're coming in for training.

101
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,120
The False Face Society
is peddling a new injectable

102
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,840
Snakebite.
It's an addictive psychedelic

103
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,800
made from mushrooms and
Scarecrow's fear toxin.

104
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,480
{\an5}Figure out the False Face
chain of command.

105
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,960
{\an5}I am not letting this
get a foothold in my city.

106
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
{\an5}Thanks. Got it.

107
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,720
Sir, from the crash investigators.

108
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,880
Kate's cell phone.

109
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,760
What is it, sir?

110
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,280
I need a password for this thing.
Agent Moore might know.

111
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,560
Have you seen her?

112
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,160
You missed a gorgeous sunrise.

113
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,880
Where are we?

114
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,040
Well, I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be,

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,080
although I'm a little surprised
they got you a companion ticket.

116
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,680
I guess they needed someone
to report back I was dead.

117
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,320
You planned on being kidnapped?

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I needed a grand gesture
to get an audience with the Queen,

119
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,040
and what do you get the
girl who has everything?

120
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,320
Answer, you get her so pissed off

121
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,600
that she sends
her most skilled killer to fetch you.

122
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,720
Sorry. Who did you piss off?

123
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,880
They're awake, my queen.

124
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,400
Good. Keep an eye on the new girl.

125
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,840
Bring me Alice.

126
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,280
Safiyah? How do you know her?

127
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,720
How do you know her?

128
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
She's been surveilling
Julia and me for months.

129
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,800
She always did like to watch.

130
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,320
And why are you here?

131
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,440
To do us both a favor.

132
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,840
You know, it's been a while
since I killed a queen.

133
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,080
For the record, when you fail

134
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,040
and I end up dead alongside you,
it's no longer considered a favor.

135
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,680
I poisoned my one true friend Mouse

136
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,160
so I could enact the perfect revenge
on my family,

137
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,920
and Safiyah ruined everything.

138
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,960
If I die today,

139
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,040
so be it.

140
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,720
Take her to the Queen.

141
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Look.

142
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,400
Whatever drama Alice
has with you people,

143
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm not part of it.
I don't need to be here.

144
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,440
No one cares what you need.

145
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,080
Great tie. Italian silk?

146
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,920
- Yeah.
- It goes well with that badge.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,560
- Dude, get your hands off me. Hey.
- What?

148
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,480
It really does bring out the color
in your eyes.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Who are you?

150
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,400
Oh. I'm that guy,
but that happy, little tune

151
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,640
has really accelerated my timetable,
so I need to be on my way.

152
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,760
Just need a few ones
and zeroes off your PC.

153
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,600
You have a gun in your lab.

154
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,400
What kind of a scientist are you?

155
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
Your safety's on.

156
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,920
Oh. I'm wrong.

157
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,160
It works just fine.

158
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,440
Two shocking deaths at a Hamilton
Dynamics research facility

159
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,400
early this morning
have the company on high alert.

160
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,720
A spokesperson for Hamilton
assures the public

161
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,400
that no firearms were compromised.

162
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,200
Here's the security footage
from the lab.

163
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,760
Guy just waltzed in there
in broad daylight.

164
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,880
Any idea what he took
from the computer?

165
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Hamilton's keeping quiet about it.

166
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,400
Aren't you literally Mary Hamilton?

167
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,400
I sold my share of the company
when my mom died,

168
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,200
and I'm not exactly close
with the board of stuffy suits.

169
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,200
Wait. You're a multibillionaire?

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,280
Why am I only making 12.50
an hour at the Hold-Up?

171
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,920
I... Well...

172
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Okay.

173
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,000
We can talk about it...

174
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,160
When did you start working
at the Hold-Up?

175
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,400
When my P.O.
wouldn't get off of my ass

176
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,640
about punching a clock.

177
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,240
We need a manager,
and she needs a civilian cover.

178
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Got him.

179
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,320
What's with the mark on his forehead?

180
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,560
Running facial rec. right now.

181
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Don't bother.

182
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,320
It's Victor Zsasz.

183
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,880
He's a hitman.
He logs his kills with hash marks.

184
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,440
How are you on a first-name basis
with a prolific hired assassin?

185
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,080
Because I know people who know him.

186
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,320
What?
We kind of run in the same circles.

187
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,720
- You run in the...
- Ran in the same circles, okay?

188
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,920
Past tense and very large,
wide circles,

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,920
which has now just come in handy

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,280
because now we know
who we're looking for.

191
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,200
My P.O. is at the Hold-Up
looking for me. I got to go.

192
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,400
What about Zsasz?

193
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
I'll deal with him
when you find his address.

194
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,680
His scars are works of art.

195
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,000
He ships in some high-end
French skin care lotion.

196
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,960
Name translates like a baby's butt

197
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,640
- or something.
- Oh! <i>Les Fesses de Bébé!</i>

198
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,400
What? It's really good stuff.

199
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,000
Yeah. You two, go...

200
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,440
Track the baby's butt.
Yeah. I got it.

201
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Okay.

202
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,720
One last meal before the slaughter?

203
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,680
I had you drugged, kidnapped,
and shipped to my doorstep.

204
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,440
This is my way
of saying no hard feelings.

205
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Come.

206
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Sit with me.

207
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,560
If it's all the same to you,

208
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,520
I prefer my poison in pill form.

209
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,280
You think I'd go to the trouble
of bringing you all the way here

210
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,400
just to poison you?

211
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,120
Yeah,
so you could have a front row seat.

212
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,720
I'm not the one
who started this fight, Alice.

213
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,240
What is the appropriate reaction
to learning my sister's plane

214
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,800
was blown out of the sky?

215
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,440
You stabbed me in the back,

216
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,760
exposed my island's
most precious resource

217
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,480
to every opportunist in Gotham.

218
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,080
Well, a wise woman once taught me

219
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,320
it's not worth sending a message
unless it's loud.

220
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,960
You always were my best student,

221
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,520
but I'm afraid
you've been misinformed.

222
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,760
I didn't blow up your sister's plane.

223
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,880
Someone wants you to think
I killed Kate

224
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,320
when the truth is I haven't thought
about her or you

225
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,080
since you left this island
5-years-ago,

226
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,560
which means the two of us
have a puzzle to solve,

227
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,560
so sit, my friend,
and join me for a glass

228
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,480
like old times.

229
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,280
Sure you got the right address?

230
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,920
Because what kind
of stone-cold killer

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,280
shops at Storage & Stuff?

232
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,440
An actual psychopath.

233
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,360
Found the drive.

234
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Nice.

235
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,360
You must be the new girl.

236
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,640
Did you find what you're looking for?

237
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,360
B-Batarang?

238
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,360
- Somebody used them all.
- They run out?

239
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,520
Use the Bo Staff.

240
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,760
While we're all waiting
for something to happen,

241
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,120
can I make you a drink?

242
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,840
There's a button
hidden on the side.

243
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
So, I take it you're the replacement.

244
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,800
What happened to the old one?

245
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
She get killed,

246
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,240
or are you like Sammy Hagar
to her David Lee Roth?

247
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,080
You're looking at me wondering
which old white guy I am?

248
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,880
Kids today. No sense of history.

249
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,200
Yeah. Not gonna sweat some freak

250
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,640
who uses his skin
as a knife sharpener.

251
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,280
Well, at least it's my skin

252
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,080
because and I'm only being honest

253
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,080
you don't seem very comfortable
in yours.

254
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
It's like...

255
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,280
Trying to pass for somebody else.

256
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,200
I didn't design the damn suit.

257
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
I can tell...

258
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,320
Because I don't see
the Batwoman in you,

259
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,200
and maybe that's because...

260
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,520
I don't see the you in Batwoman.

261
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,000
You want to know what I see?

262
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,160
Is it a shoulder-fired
surface-to-air missile?

263
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,520
Oh, hell, no!

264
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,680
I dove out of a flaming building
just for a list of names?

265
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Just a prolific hitman
with a long list of names.

266
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,680
Anyone else have a pit
in their stomach?

267
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,520
Let's figure out who they are first.

268
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,480
Janet Evans is...

269
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,280
A ninth grade biology teacher.

270
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,720
Paul Akins, plumber.

271
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,320
Jamal Walker, stock broker.

272
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,440
I... I don't get this.
I'm not seeing a connection.

273
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,880
There's no way
we can protect all these people.

274
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,800
What if we don't have to?

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,600
Zsasz doesn't find work,
work finds him,

276
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,840
meaning someone hired him
to get this list.

277
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,000
We figure out who he works for,
and we stop them.

278
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,040
- But how?
- I ask him.

279
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,080
Because he really opened up to you
the last time.

280
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,320
Not as Batwoman. As Ryan.

281
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,680
Are you insane?

282
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,680
Why would a hitman
rat out his employer?

283
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,120
But he does know who you are
or at least of you peripherally,

284
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,320
so it's worth a shot.

285
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,800
Or you become a tally mark
over his right eyebrow.

286
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,960
Or I find out who hired him.

287
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,320
You're a billionaire, right?

288
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,720
How much of that is liquid?

289
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,360
Plenty of open seats elsewhere.

290
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,520
You don't remember me.

291
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,800
I dated Angelique Martin.

292
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,080
You're Angelique's ex?

293
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,880
Then by all means,

294
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,040
stay and do whatever you want.

295
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,560
Just don't do to me
what you did to her.

296
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,200
- So, you do know me.
- I know you broke her heart.

297
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,000
Apologies if I'm overstepping.
I'm just a sucker for lesbian drama.

298
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
She was bad for me.

299
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,600
That's how you know it's love.

300
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Word on the street
your last job went sideways.

301
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,960
That mean you're available for hire?

302
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,360
You want me to kill your ex?

303
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,640
I want you to take out Alice.

304
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,120
Her Wonderland gang killed my mom.

305
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,320
Sideways doesn't mean my job's over.

306
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,120
So, whose price do I need to beat?

307
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,960
I don't kill and tell.

308
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,680
Luke,
did I get the sniffer close enough

309
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,000
-to his phone?
-Yes.

310
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,200
Vacuumed up all his data
along with 3 layers of encryption.

311
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
Stand by while I burrow
through his most recent contacts,

312
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,760
and...

313
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,600
The mystery client is...

314
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,800
Safiyah.

315
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,400
I know you want me
to be a bad person,

316
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,800
but I'm not.

317
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,320
I didn't kill your sister.

318
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,760
Last thing I'd ever do
is draw attention to my island.

319
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,920
Then why do I have a note
signed by you saying otherwise?

320
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,560
Oh, then by all means,
you got me Alice.

321
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,480
My name was on a note.

322
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Then who blew it up?

323
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,000
Clearly someone who thought
you still matter to me.

324
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,720
Last year,
I worked with one of your men,

325
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,680
the Rifle.

326
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,800
Traded a weapon designed
to kill Batwoman

327
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,520
in exchange
for a vial of your Desert Rose serum.

328
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,120
Only I reneged on my end,

329
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,240
handed over a broken piece
of technology.

330
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,480
Go on.
I'm dying to know how this ends.

331
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,960
You killed my entire gang
in retaliation.

332
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,280
You have a gang?

333
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,320
- Had.
- Killing lackeys.

334
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,600
- Sounds tedious.
- Or thorough.

335
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,640
If I was being thorough,
why are you standing here?

336
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,880
So, why is Alice still alive?

337
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,080
Safiyah prides herself
on being a fair and just ruler.

338
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,040
Safiyah took her in,
groomed her to be a soldier,

339
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,960
and promised her an eternity
of protection and health.

340
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,640
But Alice had her heart
set on destroying

341
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,520
the Kane family back in Gotham.

342
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
So let me guess.

343
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,600
Alice betrayed her?

344
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,680
Alice broke the cardinal rule
of the island.

345
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,600
She tried to leave

346
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,280
and take a Desert Rose flower
with her.

347
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,440
I've forgiven you for what you did
all those years ago...

348
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,680
Which is why it's going
to be much harder

349
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,080
forgiving you for this.

350
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,880
You exposed the secret
of the Desert Rose to the world.

351
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,560
Coryana is the garden,
and I am its keeper.

352
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,200
My family has dedicated lifetimes
to protecting its secret.

353
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,080
History is littered with colonizers
who come with their false ideals

354
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,280
and pillage for their own profit...

355
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,720
The African diamond trade,
oil in the Middle East.

356
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,400
Coryana is no different.

357
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,560
Our garden will be ravaged,

358
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,280
and our peaceful island
will cease to exist.

359
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,480
Well, maybe you should have thought
about that

360
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,840
before you blew up my sister's jet.

361
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,040
I didn't bring down her jet.

362
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,120
And I didn't expose the secret
of the Desert Rose to the world.

363
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,280
I gave it to just one person,

364
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,040
and she did the rest.

365
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,400
And who is this person?

366
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,880
Safiyah. I've never heard of her.

367
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,000
It's one of her many aliases.

368
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,320
The only Safiyah we have
in our database

369
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,080
has half a dozen European passports
with just as many names...

370
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,480
- Nasar, Sohail, Patel...
- Okay. So, how do we find her?

371
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,280
Well, if she's extremely shady,

372
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,480
odds are Ryan's already
in a book club with her.

373
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,760
What's your problem with her?

374
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,240
I don't have a problem with Ryan.

375
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,200
Then what's your problem with me?

376
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,040
This is not a permanent gig.

377
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,520
I know. You've said
that a thousand times.

378
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,800
Then why get her a job,
lie to her P.O.,

379
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
throw a pep rally every time
she does something right?

380
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,360
Because we're her team.
She's the Bat.

381
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,480
She's a stand-in who fits in the suit

382
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,640
- until Kate comes back.
- Except she's not!

383
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,720
Kate is not coming back, Luke.

384
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,480
How can you say that
after everything we've been through?

385
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,640
Because there are scientific theories
on multiple worlds,

386
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,680
and there are odds
for surviving a car crash.

387
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,400
Do you know what the odds are

388
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,880
for surviving
a plane explosion mid-air,

389
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,600
and even if you do survive
the explosion,

390
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,840
how do you survive the fall?

391
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
You looked me in the eye

392
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,720
and said, "miracles happen".

393
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,360
I know...

394
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,160
But so do tragedies.

395
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,960
And the city needs a hero.

396
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,560
It needs a Batwoman,
someone who's not perfect

397
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,960
but who can show us all
that there is still hope

398
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,800
despite everything,

399
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,800
and that's Ryan.

400
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,440
Good. You're still here.

401
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
You need to see this.

402
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
What's up?

403
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,560
Roxanne's CT-scans came back.

404
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,520
Oh, no. Did her cancer progress?

405
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,800
That was the scan from last month.

406
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,280
This was from yesterday.

407
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,400
Where'd her cancer go?

408
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,360
<i>Stage 3 cancer doesn't just
disappear overnight.</i>

409
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,680
What's the patient's name?

410
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
<i>Roxanne Adams.</i>

411
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,080
According to her medical records

412
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,840
she was treated
for the Bat bite the other night.

413
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,200
She's on here.

414
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,680
Then I think this is a list
of Hamilton's record

415
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,000
of everyone
who was treated for the Bat-toxin.

416
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,520
Then it should have treated
the toxin,

417
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,760
not an incurable cancer.

418
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,280
Yeah. Well, the Desert Rose
is a universal cure-all,

419
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,720
so I knew it would treat
the symptoms of the Bat-bite.

420
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,880
I never dreamed

421
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,520
that it would cure
people's preexisting conditions.

422
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,160
Okay. Meaning what,
that every person on this list

423
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,880
has a miracle drug running
through their veins?

424
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Oh, my God.

425
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Mary?

426
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
Zsasz is here. I need you.

427
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Hi.

428
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,360
You're Victor Zsasz.

429
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,440
I'm actually here
to clean up a little mess.

430
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,840
It seems you and I have ruffled
some of the same feathers.

431
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,080
Now, I have to tie up
some loose ends.

432
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,120
Would those feathers
belong to Safiyah?

433
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you,

434
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,080
so I'll just tell you yes.

435
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,520
Okay, okay.
You keep trying her. I'll suit up.

436
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,560
Oh, and don't kill me,
but I made some alterations.

437
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,480
To what, the suit? It's not yours.

438
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,360
I know. It's Kate's,
but if I'm gonna be Batwoman,

439
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,640
- I'm doing it my way.
- But the suit is perfect.

440
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,800
Have you seen the damn wig?

441
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,360
Now, let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

442
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,120
First I make you bleed,
then I make me bleed.

443
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,920
Don't you get it?
The chase is half the fun.

444
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,960
You see me now?

445
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,600
New look.

446
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,840
New Batwoman.

447
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,320
So, let me get this straight.

448
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,000
Alice, the defector thief,

449
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,520
is granted a private audience
with your queen

450
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,960
while you, the loyal soldier,
gets to babysit me all day.

451
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,440
That's why you hate Alice, isn't it?

452
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,520
If Safiyah lets Alice live today,

453
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,640
I need you to be okay with her
roaming free in Gotham.

454
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,800
Wouldn't it be easier
for the both of us

455
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,840
if I dumped her ass in a padded cell?

456
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,200
Easy rarely earns victory.

457
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,720
What victory?

458
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,240
Why are we here?
What do you really want with us?

459
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
Are you going to grant
her freedom or not?

460
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,800
The second I have the chance,
I'm putting Alice away for good.

461
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,600
Then I have no more use for you.

462
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,000
Okay. Now, that was really something.

463
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,720
Real confidence behind it.

464
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,800
I haven't been kicked
like that since...

465
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,040
Well, Batman.

466
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,840
Not trying to pass for him either.

467
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,720
Story for another time,

468
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,520
but you should ask yourself.

469
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,480
If the person
you're inflicting pain on

470
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,480
actually enjoys pain...

471
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,200
At what point, do you just give up?

472
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,440
Look who's comfortable now.

473
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,640
Okay.

474
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,280
I so dig the new wig.

475
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,280
I hated what you did,

476
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,840
but I'd be lying
if I said I hated how you did it.

477
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,000
Poisoning hundreds of people only
to turn around and save them

478
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
just to spite a single enemy.

479
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,520
You got my attention.

480
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,120
This may come as a shock to you,

481
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,520
but your approval
means very little to me.

482
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,240
Wasn't always the case.

483
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,960
Remember when we met?

484
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,200
You were hiding out
on that yacht we were raiding.

485
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,920
You'd just escaped captivity.

486
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,640
Your Mouse locked away,
his father out in the world.

487
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,440
You were so broken,

488
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,120
so angry like a Siren
thrashing in her net.

489
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,160
You thanked me for finding you.

490
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,960
You didn't find me.

491
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,200
No. No. You found yourself

492
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,280
because I taught you how
to turn your rage into power,

493
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,240
but that rage
never included killing Kate,

494
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,040
and now it consumes you to the point

495
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,560
of seeking revenge
against her supposed killer?

496
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,080
Why?

497
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
What happened?

498
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,040
Can't a girl change her mind?

499
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,640
Not the girl I knew.

500
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,440
Not the girl who loved her sister
more than anyone.

501
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,840
What happened between the two of you,
Alice?

502
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,600
If you must know...

503
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,560
I always thought Kate
and I were one and the same,

504
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,040
not hero and villain,
just two sisters...

505
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,240
who would do anything
for one another...

506
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,600
But I was wrong.

507
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,080
You took everything from me.

508
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,240
Because I gave you everything.

509
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,000
Just like I'll give you your sister.

510
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,640
That's Kate's necklace.

511
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,960
If I blew up Kate's plane
with her inside,

512
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,240
how could I possibly have this?

513
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,880
That's enough.

514
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,600
What purpose does she serve?

515
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,560
I said that'll be all.

516
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,080
It's been a long time

517
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,800
since someone got the drop
on that one,

518
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,360
let alone without hands.

519
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,200
You have fire in you.

520
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,240
Now, I see why Miss Pennyworth
stuck around.

521
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
We're done here.

522
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,520
I am not leaving this island
without Kate.

523
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,760
She'll be brought back to the island
as soon as you leave.

524
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,680
I'm not foolish enough
to have you both here

525
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
at the same time.

526
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,280
And I'm supposed to just believe you?

527
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,800
I have every intention
of giving you your sister back,

528
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,800
but before I do,...

529
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,680
I need you to do something for me.

530
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,000
The Bat is back in black.

531
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,680
Last night, Gotham's newest resident
made a dramatic debut,

532
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,000
putting the pizazz
in taking down Zsasz.

533
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,480
Hey, Batwoman. Love the new do.

534
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
You see this?

535
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,960
We got a new one.

536
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,160
The very definition of vigilante

537
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,600
is one who acts without recourse
to lawful procedures.

538
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,560
Well, yeah, but she's awesome.

539
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,000
Fine. Let's talk about Ryan Wilder.

540
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,400
I spoke to your employer.

541
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,680
She's been happy
with our performance.

542
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,400
She better be.
I saved her ass last night.

543
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,000
We were out of gin.

544
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,640
I... I got more.

545
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,320
Right. Well, next step housing.

546
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,040
It's on my to-do list.

547
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,440
Do you know
what's on Batwoman's to-do list?

548
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,720
Literally saving the city

549
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,960
from falling
into a black hole of despair.

550
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,160
You need a home address by next week,

551
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,920
or I'm writing you up.

552
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Yes, ma'am.

553
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,240
Why am I still alive?

554
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,840
Yeah.
That's probably not a good thing.

555
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,160
Why is that not a good thing?

556
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,520
Because Safiyah spared you,
which means she has a crush on you,

557
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,400
which is all very well
and good until it's not.

558
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,360
Why are you still alive?

559
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,640
Because Safiyah
and I need each other.

560
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Toodle-loo.

561
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,120
Hey. You're still one
of Gotham's most wanted criminals.

562
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,880
But if you arrest me,

563
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,520
then I can't complete
the job that your new...

564
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,560
Girlfriend has tasked me with,

565
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,880
and then she might never tell me
where...

566
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,000
Kate is.

567
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
Kate?

568
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,320
"Bat Girl Magic", huh?

569
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,120
Where did they get
a professional photo of you?

570
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,440
You didn't hear?

571
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,560
Yeah. Mary's doing all my P.R. now.

572
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,520
Well, of course she is.

573
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,160
Crazy. My P.O. is obsessed with her.

574
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,360
Meanwhile,
I'm one late appointment away

575
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,760
from being a repeat offender.

576
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,120
Well, people underestimate you.

577
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Yeah.

578
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,240
Still a sick way
to hide a secret identity.

579
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,440
Yeah, maybe not when it's coming
from the person you're working with.

580
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Just...

581
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,280
I got a few more made.

582
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,360
I'll work on my aim.

583
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
That'd be great.

584
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,520
And I wanted to say I'm sorry
for being so hard on you.

585
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,280
You kicked some major ass yesterday.

586
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
I get it.

587
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,160
You miss Kate

588
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,520
but I need you to give me a chance

589
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,120
a real chance till she's back.

590
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,680
Yeah. Deal.

591
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
And...

592
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,800
Let me make some upgrades
to the Batmobile.

593
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,120
Okay. Now, you're being crazy again.

594
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,600
"May your memory be a blessing".

595
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,040
It's a traditional Jewish
honor for the dead.

596
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,880
I'm not ready to say it yet.

597
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,920
I know I shouldn't have kept
how I feel from you.

598
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,480
But it doesn't change
the fact that it is how I feel.

599
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,920
That doesn't change how I feel.

600
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,480
What's his mask made of wood?

601
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,600
Commander says to go
after the head of the snake.

602
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,920
According to my C.I.,

603
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,400
that guy is at the top
of the False Face Society.

604
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,960
- You got a name?
- Not yet.

605
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,000
Get one.
I'm not giving the boss a photo

606
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,400
of some dude in a black mask.

607
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
You're here.

608
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,320
NTSP found Kate's phone
in the wreckage.

609
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,760
Since you and Mary
wouldn't answer my calls,

610
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,800
I had the tech team on all night
trying to override the password.

611
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,400
Actually, that's why I'm here.

612
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,800
Do you have any idea what in the hell

613
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,280
Kate was doing looking
into a painting by Jack Napier?

614
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,120
Maybe we can ask her
when we find her, sir.

615
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,480
I think Kate's alive.
