1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,480
{\an5}This is Dana Dewitt reporting
live on the scene

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,800
{\an5}with breaking news!

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,480
{\an5}And breaking bones as Batwoman
has taken the fight

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,240
{\an5}to the False Face society,
disrupting their supply chain

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,840
{\an5}of the highly addictive
street drug, Snakebite.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,000
{\an5}This is the third
distribution center this week

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,800
{\an5}that Batwoman has targeted
in her mission

8
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,840
{\an5}to rid Gotham's streets
of this scourge.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,280
Who is Black Mask?

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,560
- I want the name!
- I don't know!

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,160
Look. That's why we
all wear masks.

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,520
{\an5}You hear me, Black Mask?

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,560
{\an5}You can hide your face,
but you can't hide from me.

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,360
{\an5}I am coming for you!

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,800
<i>In a Channel Eight exclusive,</i>

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,520
<i>Batwoman laid down the law
and declared war on Black Mask</i>

17
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,400
<i>and citizens of Gotham have
high hopes</i>

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,840
<i>that she can succeed where the GCPD.</i>

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,840
<i>and the Crows have failed.</i>

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You stay here.

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,040
- Where is she?
- Mr. Kane, there's been

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,640
- a terrible misunderstanding.
- Where is my daughter?

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,080
Sir, please allow me to explain.

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,560
My daughter, Beth, called me
not one hour ago from this house.

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,040
She said, "help," clear as can be.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,720
It was all an insensitive prank.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,840
I'm... I'm...
I'm so embarrassed. I...

28
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,200
Mr. Kane, your daughter
is not in there.

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,240
Beth! Beth!

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,080
Beth, are you in here?

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Beth?

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,240
- Beth?
- Daddy?

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,920
You came for me.

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
I knew you would.

35
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,560
I'd never stop looking for you.

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Never.

37
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,720
You pretty much broke the internet
with this latest False Face takedown.

38
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,280
{\an5}Only thing that would have
gotten you more likes

39
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,760
{\an5}is if you'd done it holding a kitten

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,840
{\an5}but I do have to point out
that you were literally

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,040
{\an5}holding a microphone
and didn't go for the mic drop.

42
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,480
Thought about it.
Wanted to stay on message.

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,320
Well, I think Black Mask
heard it loud and clear.

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
If you're still calling him that,
I'm assuming

45
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,840
you haven't figured out
his real name.

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,440
{\an5}He told me Batwoman
killed his daughter.

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,000
{\an5}Seriously, that doesn't
shorten the list?

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,040
{\an5}There is no list.
Kate never killed anybody's daughter.

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,520
{\an5}Don't forget he also
blames the Crows.

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,280
{\an5}I assume next week
it'll be Aquaman.

51
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Damn.

52
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
{\an5}Wait, wait, wait.

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
{\an5}- Is your watch fast?
- Have you met me?

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,640
{\an5}- Then I'm already late.
- For what?

55
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,960
{\an5}Visiting hours.

56
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
{\an5}Thanks for coming.

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,200
Hadn't heard from you in a bit.

58
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,640
{\an5}Commissary account's down to nada.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,560
{\an5}Ten-minute phone call
costs 22 bones and change.

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,400
{\an5}Damn. It was 11.50
when I was inside.

61
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Welcome to the Edgewater
private prison system

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,040
and seven cents an hour
pressing blue jeans

63
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,480
doesn't go as far as it used to

64
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,440
{\an5}but I... know you didn't come here

65
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,120
{\an5}because you miss being on the inside.

66
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,600
{\an5}Tell me what am I
missing on the outside.

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,600
{\an5}I'm helping to get
a community center off the ground

68
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,560
kind of place you
and I would have loved,

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,560
you know, gives kids
a safe space to go to

70
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,280
{\an5}instead of going into the system.

71
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,960
Open house is tonight.

72
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,960
{\an5}Sounds nice.

73
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,520
{\an5}I wish I could get to see it.

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
You could.

75
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,920
{\an5}You could walk right out of here

76
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,640
{\an5}if you just give up the ones

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,200
{\an5}who actually pulled the trigger
on Commissioner Forbes.

78
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
{\an5}Look.

79
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,080
{\an5}I know you took the fall
to keep me safe from False Face

80
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,200
but I can protect myself.

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,440
Sure it's not Batwoman
protecting you?

82
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
{\an5}Is she your girlfriend now?

83
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,000
{\an5}are guys like super friends
with benefits?

84
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,040
Trust me it is not like that.

85
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
{\an5}It never is till it is.

86
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,480
I'm late for my seven cents an hour.

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
Thank you all for coming.

88
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,040
As you look around
and see all we have to offer,

89
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,320
know that none of it
would have been possible

90
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,120
without the relentless
dedication of our volunteers.

91
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,480
{\an5}And I know they wanted
to remain anonymous

92
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,280
so I'll just say

93
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,680
{\an5}to Mary Hamilton and Ryan Wilder

94
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,040
{\an5}your secret's safe with me.

95
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,480
You women are superheroes.

96
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,400
- Keep smiling.
- That's what I'm doing.

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,000
{\an5}Please feel free
to look around and see

98
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
{\an5}all the activities we have to offer.

99
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,320
{\an5}You'll find we've got everything here

100
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,320
{\an5}from intramural sports
to after-school tutoring

101
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,440
- and we als...
- What about security?

102
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,320
Horten Spence, <i>Gotham Gazette.</i>

103
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,200
{\an5}Well, Mr. Spence, don't you think

104
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,480
{\an5}the kids around here already
have enough armed men

105
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
{\an5}watching their every move?

106
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Look.

107
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,320
Don't get me wrong.
I like what you're doing,

108
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,680
but this is a rough neighborhood.

109
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
The stats don't lie.

110
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,360
If you want numbers, Mr. Spence,
how about a 10% drop in crime

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,520
or a 15% increase
in graduation rates?

112
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
Those are the numbers
that neighborhoods see

113
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,400
when community centers
like this open their doors.

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,720
You aren't worried
about this place being a target?

115
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,880
for budget cuts, maybe.

116
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,360
You know, despite doing so much,

117
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,360
places like this are always
first on the chopping block.

118
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,520
Maybe the gazette could
do a story about that.

119
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,280
- Good turnout.
- Oh, my god. Tell me about it.

120
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,520
I already have
to refresh the refreshments.

121
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,720
Wilder, I want you to meet Imani,

122
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,760
Director of our tutoring program.

123
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,960
Oh. Well, you certainly schooled
that reporter back there.

124
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,880
- I'm Ryan.
- I know.

125
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,360
I hear you're gonna be teaching
a martial arts class.

126
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,080
I actually hadn't gotten around
to roping her into that yet...

127
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Until now.

128
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Saturday morning.

129
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Think about it.

130
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,520
Look who needs a refill. Me!

131
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm hoping you're gonna say
yes to that

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,120
because if you don't teach
martial arts, that means I have to

133
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,440
and my roundhouse kick is a disaster.

134
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,800
Well, I figure
it's the least I can do.

135
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
Crazy. I...

136
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,600
I can't help but think how much
a place like this would have

137
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,320
really made a difference
for my friends and I growing up.

138
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,920
Yeah. These places are so important,

139
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,160
especially for at-risk kids.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,680
It's so easy for them to
fall through the cracks.

141
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Yeah, I know.

142
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,320
I have a friend who's still falling.

143
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,040
Everybody, down!

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,280
<i>For those of you not keeping up
on current events</i>

145
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,240
<i>how's this
for a shocking development?</i>

146
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,960
<i>A community center in Sheldon Park
just got barbequed by a man wielding</i>

147
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
<i>what can only be described
as a lightning gun.</i>

148
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,120
<i>The media has dubbed him Kilovolt.</i>

149
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
<i>I don't know about you, Gotham</i>

150
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,800
<i>but I'm hoping lightning
doesn't strike twice.</i>

151
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,760
Kilovolt? based on the energy needed

152
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,080
to do that kind of damage,
they're only off

153
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,560
by about a billion volts.

154
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,600
That's your takeaway?
the nickname dropped a few zeroes?

155
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,120
My point being a weapon
with that kind of firepower

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,000
costs a hell of a lot more than
the building it was used to destroy.

157
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,880
It was more than a building.

158
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,920
That place was gonna
make a difference.

159
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,040
I don't get it. Why take it out?

160
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,440
It's not like there
was any money in it.

161
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,320
It's about to have
even less money now.

162
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Donors running for their lives

163
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,560
isn't exactly the press
we were looking for.

164
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,520
But it was the story
the press was looking for.

165
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't you think it was a little weird

166
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,480
that reporter asking
about the place being a target

167
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
right before it became a target?

168
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,560
- What was the guy's name?
- Horten Spence.

169
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
He writes for the gazette.

170
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Not anymore he doesn't.

171
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,920
He was fired six months ago
for undisclosed reasons.

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,080
Okay. Then I get
why he'd have a grudge

173
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,240
against the gazette,
but what does that

174
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,920
have to do with the community center?

175
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,480
Only one way to find out.

176
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
I don't get it.

177
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,320
Yeah. Well, that makes two of us.

178
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,920
These are expense report records

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,240
from when I was chasing down leads
on Kate's whereabouts.

180
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,880
Two nights in Monaco,
a layover in Valencia,

181
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,360
a car rental in Madrid.

182
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
So, what's the problem?

183
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I have no memory
of being in any of those places.

184
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,320
No judgment here, but...

185
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Were you drinking?

186
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,280
Well, I was searching for one ex,

187
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,960
having just been dumped by another.

188
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,960
So, yeah, alcohol was consumed

189
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,320
but not that much.

190
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,400
But if you don't remember,
how do you remember

191
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,640
it wasn't that much.

192
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,000
So, it would appear that the obvious
explanation is the correct one.

193
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,480
Hey. Don't beat yourself up.

194
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Agent Pennyworth.

195
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,840
Just got an anonymous tip
about a break-in at a farm.

196
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,520
The address matches a property

197
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,760
that once belonged
to an August Cartwright.

198
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,840
What else did this tipster say?

199
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,880
nothing other than to pass
the message on to you and only you.

200
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,440
At least, I think it's you.

201
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,920
Tipster said to pass the message on
to an Agent Penny Dreadful.

202
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Does that mean anything to you?

203
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,560
Unfortunately, it does.

204
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,400
I see you got my message.

205
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,240
Oh, the sad desperation
came through loud and clear.

206
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,800
Gotham's most deranged diva reduced
to making prank phone calls.

207
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
What's next?

208
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,640
Ding-dong-ditch?

209
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,480
How about ghost in the graveyard?

210
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,200
Oh, you're not gonna kill me.

211
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,000
You'd just be lonely again.

212
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
I mean,...

213
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,200
that's why I'm here, isn't it?

214
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,920
With Kate gone...

215
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,680
because no one really cares
about your every move.

216
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
I mean,

217
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,120
the new Batwoman doesn't
give a damn about you anymore

218
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,840
and that must drive
you absolutely crazy.

219
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Crazier.

220
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,760
What will Alice become now
that her sister is dead?

221
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,480
I mean, it's the age-old
question, isn't it?

222
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,880
If a lunatic throws
a tantrum in a forest

223
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,640
will anyone hear?

224
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,000
Guess Gotham's not much
of a playground without a playmate.

225
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,480
I don't need a playmate.

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,120
I need a partner.

227
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,200
Well, your last overture at partners
ended with a knife in my gut, so...

228
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,440
Oh, I really need to work
on my negotiating skills.

229
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
How about this?

230
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,280
You help me and I'll leave Gotham...

231
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Forever.

232
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,600
Go on. Why would I believe you?

233
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,520
Because you would help me
in ridding myself

234
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
of any reason to stay.

235
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
See, I need to find
a particular associate

236
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,880
of our mutual friend Safiyah.

237
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,040
She goes by the catchy,
little pseudonym of Enigma.

238
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Never heard of her,

239
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,320
but if you want her dead,
she can't be all bad.

240
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,040
Actually, she's quite good...

241
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,320
At a certain skill that I require.

242
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
What would that be?

243
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,680
Hypnotism, specifically the ability

244
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,880
to erase memories, alter others.

245
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,320
Looking to purge
our guilty conscience, are we,

246
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,440
leave Gotham with a clean slate?

247
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,760
Something like that.

248
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,960
Well, how do you even know
that this Enigma can do all that?

249
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,880
Because she's done it to me before.

250
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,040
It was a fluke
that I found out really.

251
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,640
Enigma erased any trace
that she'd ever been there.

252
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,840
I suppose you could say
that I forgot to remember

253
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,080
what she made me forget.

254
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,800
How is that even possible?

255
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,720
You can ask her

256
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,480
when we find her.

257
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,960
Well, that's just it.

258
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,640
I think I already have.

259
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,120
You wanted to see me, Commander?

260
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,080
Yeah. Come in, Dr. Rhyme come in.

261
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
Evelyn, please.

262
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
I...

263
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,200
I just wanted to thank you

264
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,720
for taking time away
from your practice

265
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,840
to lend your expertise
to our Snakebite taskforce.

266
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,320
- My pleasure.
- I read your report

267
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,720
on what makes Snakebite
so incredibly addictive

268
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,800
though I admit I got a little bit
lost in the medical jargon.

269
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Could you just...

270
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,560
Could you just break
it down for a guy

271
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,080
who doesn't have a Ph.D.
in criminal psychiatry?

272
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,280
The drug attacks the hippocampus,

273
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,120
where the brain stores
memories and emotions.

274
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,280
It targets the memories most
associated with regret and remorse,

275
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,280
which result in a hallucination

276
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,600
that allows the user to alter
the circumstances of those memories.

277
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,120
To get a do-over.

278
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,760
And what could be
more addictive than that,

279
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,400
the chance to right
our worst mistakes,

280
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,720
to erase our gravest sins
even for a moment?

281
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,520
How long have you been
using Snakebite, Commander?

282
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,480
What are you talking about?

283
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,840
Commander Kane,

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,840
if we're not honest with each other,

285
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
then...

286
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,840
this is just a waste of...
both of our time.

287
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Some...

288
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,000
False Face bastard jumped me
in my car, chloroformed me.

289
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,040
I woke up with an injector in my arm.

290
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
I guess since I've been railing
against Snakebite

291
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,120
in the press they wanted
to send me a message.

292
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,480
How could you tell?

293
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,440
Because I'm very good at my job

294
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,320
and even if you've had just one dose,

295
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,680
you're gonna need my help.

296
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,760
Sneaking out the backdoor?

297
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,440
I'm just glad it's you.

298
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,400
Said no suspicious dude ever.

299
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,440
- Expecting someone else?
- Yeah.

300
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,560
A guy packing
a handheld lightning storm.

301
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
I'm sure you've heard of him.

302
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,240
Yeah. So, who is he?

303
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,080
- I don't know.
- But you know his schedule.

304
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,040
How did you know he was gonna attack
the community center?

305
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,200
Because it's happened before.

306
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,200
Not by Kilovolt.
He's just the latest player

307
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,600
in a game that's been going
on for a while.

308
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,920
- I'm not following.
- Nobody is.

309
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,520
That's the problem. Community centers
are being terrorized.

310
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,120
The narrows midnight basketball
gets torched by an arsonist.

311
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,080
Diamond district tutoring center
gets shot up.

312
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,680
Anything that was
a refuge for kids...

313
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,240
Taken off the board.

314
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,360
Not seeing a connection.

315
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,600
<i>They're all different M.O.s.</i>

316
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,080
I'm telling you
the Sheldon Park attack

317
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,760
wasn't the first
and it won't be the last.

318
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,920
We're talking about
at-risk youth programs,

319
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,280
not exactly the most
threatening institutions in Gotham.

320
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
What's the motive?

321
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,960
That's exactly the question
I as asking

322
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,120
when I was suddenly
fired from the gazette.

323
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Do you have any proof?

324
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,760
As a matter of fact, I do.

325
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,320
After last night's attack, my
editor's agreed to take another look.

326
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,680
Put him on here.

327
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Okay. Up.

328
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Okay.

329
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,080
Third-degree electrical burns.

330
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,920
See if the Crows left us
any mafenide acetate cream.

331
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,240
Cabinet middle shelf.

332
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,840
I'm gonna have to sedate him.

333
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,640
- But he'll make it?
- I think so.

334
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,800
Looks like his laptop
took the brunt of it.

335
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,280
Someone went to a lot
of trouble to destroy the evidence

336
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
on this computer,

337
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,040
which means there must be some truth
to the story he was trying to tell.

338
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,520
Figure out where that
thing came from?

339
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,640
Well, it matches
some tech being sold

340
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
by a shady Russian
defense contractor.

341
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,280
I'm guessing the kind that
doesn't give up their client list.

342
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
We may not need it.

343
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,200
Got a partial print here.

344
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
The rest is...

345
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,120
hidden under the battery.

346
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,800
At least, I think it's the battery.

347
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,520
Are you sure you should
be messing with that?

348
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Relax.

349
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Okay.

350
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,160
See? Nothing to worry about.

351
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,720
Let's find out who you are, kilovolt.

352
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,280
Michael Kastrinos, a.k.a Mickey K.

353
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Got an address?

354
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,320
Yes. Cell block J
at Edgewater prison,

355
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,240
where he's been locked up
for the last two years.

356
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,880
So, you were in boring Madrid
filing boring paperwork before taking

357
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,920
a boring flight back to Gotham.

358
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,160
And from there, I followed
the trail to Bludhaven,

359
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,160
where I eventually found
Kate's remains.

360
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Not according to your boarding pass,

361
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,960
which you apparently
used as an itinerary.

362
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,200
Before heading off to Bludhaven,
you had a meeting

363
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,080
with a Dr. Evelyn Rhyme.

364
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
You don't remember that?

365
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
No.

366
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,480
Dr. Rhyme is a consultant
with the Crows' Snakebite task force.

367
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,520
Why would I want to talk to her?

368
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,480
what say you fly to the nest
and ask Dr. Rhyme.

369
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
What about you?

370
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,080
She has a private practice
on sixth and...

371
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,080
I'm feeling nosy.

372
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,800
See? We make a great team.

373
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,640
Oh, come on.

374
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,680
We aren't so different

375
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
You and I.

376
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,760
All we have in common

377
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,480
is that we both miss Kate.

378
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,520
Well, there is one other thing.

379
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
No matter how much
we both loved Kate,

380
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,280
she always chose someone else.

381
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,240
Is that what you
want Enigma to erase,

382
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,320
all those hurt feelings?

383
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
No.

384
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,960
I want her to erase...

385
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,160
The person who caused them.

386
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,440
That was my life's biggest regret,

387
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,240
my greatest failure,

388
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,160
not saving Beth.

389
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,240
Not an hour goes by
that I don't think about it

390
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,800
leaving my daughter
to suffer in that cell.

391
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,080
That's why I can't
shake off this urge

392
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,600
for another hit of Snakebite

393
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,000
because for another

394
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,640
few fleeting moments

395
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,160
i get to be the father I should
have been to her all those years ago.

396
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,960
Who else have you told about this?

397
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,640
- No one.
- Not even family?

398
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,840
My daughter Mary's
the only family I have left.

399
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,240
We're not exactly speaking.

400
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,040
Unfortunately,...

401
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,120
there's nothing I can give you
to blunt the withdrawal,

402
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,120
but there is a way
you can blunt the pain

403
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,440
of the daughter you lost.

404
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
How?

405
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,200
by focusing on repairing
the relationship

406
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,640
with the daughter you have left.

407
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,920
Garcia, housed on A block.

408
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,480
You my new lawyer?

409
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,320
I wanted to ask
about the recent attack

410
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,120
on the Sheldon Park
community center.

411
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Who are you?

412
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,000
And the attempted murder
of Horten Spence.

413
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,160
I don't have to answer any
of your questions, bitch.

414
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,040
You already have.

415
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,520
- He did it. Mickey K's Kilovolt.
- He can't be.

416
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,960
The guy has a laceration right

417
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,760
where I sliced him
in the alley. It's him.

418
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,680
Not according to the prison
surveillance footage.

419
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,040
I'm currently looking at footage

420
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,800
from the nights
of both Kilovolt attacks.

421
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,960
Mickey K Is locked up
tight in his cell.

422
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,000
Two visits in one week?

423
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,680
Aren't I the belle of the block?

424
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,960
I was wondering if maybe
you can help me with something.

425
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,560
Grapevine buzzing
about any recent prison escapes,

426
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,680
any rumors of a secret way
in or out of here?

427
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,080
You think if I knew a way out
I'd still be sitting here?

428
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Why do you ask?

429
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,200
Thinking of busting me out?

430
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,840
you know, I would do
anything for you,

431
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,960
but the one thing I can't do is

432
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,800
convince you to punch
your ticket out of here.

433
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
Come on, Ang.

434
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,720
The shooters were wearing
a hockey mask and a gas mask.

435
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,960
Give me the names
of the guys underneath.

436
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,720
If I tell you their names,
I'll be the next one

437
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,160
Black Mask puts a bullet in.

438
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,160
Batwoman can't be around
to protect me 24 hours a day.

439
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
But I can.

440
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,640
It's just you and me...

441
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,520
against the world...

442
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,800
like always.

443
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,960
I will never let
Black Mask hurt you.

444
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,720
You're forgiven.

445
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,520
Does anyone else want to apologize

446
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,280
for the fact that
for the last two weeks

447
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,640
not a single viable dose
of Snakebite has been produced?

448
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Anyone?

449
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,680
I got plenty of bullets
to go around.

450
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
Sir.

451
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,760
You can kill
as many of us as you want.

452
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,680
It won't change the fact
that you wanted to keep

453
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,520
the Snakebite recipe a secret.

454
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,800
And now, we've lost the only
two people who knew it.

455
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,240
Ocean disappeared weeks ago

456
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,280
and his little helper's
locked away in prison.

457
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
You got to get her out.

458
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,320
You can't let Angelique
rot in there.

459
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,520
I sent you the names of the men
who gunned down Forbes.

460
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I know. I got
all six of your voicemails.

461
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,760
I'll look into the names she gave me.

462
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,640
I already did, ok?
They manage the Gotham gun club.

463
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,320
Is it that hard to imagine
guys who work

464
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,120
at a shooting range
pulling the trigger?

465
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,560
- Okay. I'll run it down.
- And?

466
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,440
And if the story checks out,

467
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
I'll talk to the DA
about getting your girl sprung.

468
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Hey.

469
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,720
So, this is from the night of
the attack on the community center.

470
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
And this...

471
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,400
is from two weeks ago.

472
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,400
Now check out
the two hands of solitaire.

473
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
They're identical...

474
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,680
Just like these surveillance tapes.

475
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
It's the same footage.

476
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,520
They just slapped
a new time stamp on it and

477
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
instant alibi.

478
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,240
So, is the prison trying
to cover up the fact

479
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,640
that he escaped and destroyed
the community center?

480
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,000
Worse. I think they let him out.

481
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,080
Our friend, Mickey K,here
wasn't gonna be eligible

482
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,560
for parole for another decade.

483
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,520
And then suddenly, the day after
the community center attack

484
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,520
he was granted
a hearing for early release.

485
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
So...

486
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,880
I took the schedule
for recent parole hearings

487
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,720
and I matched it
against spence's list

488
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,480
of attacks on community programs.

489
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,400
Guess what happened after the narrows
midnight basketball was torched.

490
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,400
They paroled a serial arsonist.

491
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,880
And here's another big, wet kiss
from Edgewater's parole board.

492
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,520
This one an armed
robbery enthusiast

493
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
conveniently scheduled...

494
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,800
the day after the Diamond
District Tutoring Center got shot up.

495
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,240
Okay, okay. So, someone
from the prison

496
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,000
is letting out criminals
for one night

497
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
to target community programs
in exchange for early parole.

498
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
And that someone...

499
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,120
Is edgewater correctional
CEO Ellis O'Brien.

500
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,680
He personally intervened

501
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
and signed off
on each early release,

502
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,280
all under the guise
of "time off for good behavior"

503
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,920
and he sits on the board
of the <i>Gotham Gazette.</i>

504
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,800
which puts him in the position
to get Horten fired

505
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,640
before he can find out
who's behind the attacks.

506
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Yeah, but I still don't get why.

507
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,120
Why would a prison company
want to destroy community programs?

508
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,800
It's exactly what imani said.

509
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,920
These programs keep kids
from falling through the cracks

510
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,680
but you know who profits
from the kids who do?

511
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Prisons.

512
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,960
Jake. Hey, buddy.

513
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,840
Listen. I'm sorry
to barge in like this,

514
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,760
waving my Crows platinum client card

515
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,320
but I just needed to speak
to somebody I knew I could trust.

516
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
What's wrong, roman?

517
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,320
Well, I was doing a routine check

518
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,120
on one of my cosmetics stores.

519
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,800
Long story short, a search of one

520
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,680
of my employees' lockers

521
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
turned up this.

522
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,360
That's Snakebite, right?

523
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,840
i didn't want to make a big thing
about it without knowing for sure.

524
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,400
I mean, I've heard of the stuff,
but i've never actually seen it.

525
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,600
Is that the real deal?

526
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,160
Yeah. Yeah. It's the real deal.

527
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,680
Well, it's good
I brought it to you then.

528
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,800
I know how hard you've
been pushing to get

529
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
this stuff off the streets.

530
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,200
I just can't believe
my own staff would...

531
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,720
You know, I mean,
I bought it was a kid drug

532
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,480
but this stuff must
really be making the rounds?

533
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,440
Listen. I've got
things, covered on my end.

534
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,440
Can you dispose of this,
make sure it doesn't get

535
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,640
into the wrong hands?

536
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,360
I mean, if it's as bad as you say

537
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,800
this stuff could really
ruin someone's life.

538
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Yeah.

539
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,880
I'll take care of it.

540
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,800
You're the best, Jake.

541
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Dr. Rhyme.

542
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,640
Agent Pennyworth, how are you?

543
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Stumped, actually.

544
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,280
I was hoping you could
clear something up.

545
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,000
Last month when I'd
just returned to Gotham

546
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,320
you asked to see me.

547
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
This is gonna sound strange

548
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
but...

549
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,120
Do you mind
if I ask what we discussed?

550
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,280
It was a matter of some sensitivity.

551
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
Perhaps we should
discuss it in private.

552
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,960
Have a seat, Dr. Rhyme.

553
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,960
Or would you prefer Enigma?

554
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,160
What did you do to me?

555
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,760
Same thing I'm about to do.

556
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,760
Make you forget.

557
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,400
I got a lock on the CEO's phone.

558
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,800
He seems to be working late
at the sight

559
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,120
of Edgewater's latest lockup.

560
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,440
Surveying your latest money maker?

561
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Who's there?

562
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,240
I need a security team down...

563
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,480
Tell me how much money does
the city pay you per prisoner?

564
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,480
One-hundred fifty a day.

565
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,320
So, you're raking in
a couple hundred million a year

566
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
to warehouse people?

567
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,120
there's nothing illegal about it.

568
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,160
That's the problem.
All that money means

569
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,840
you'll be willing to do anything
to keep your cells filled.

570
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,880
That's why you sent Kilovolt
to fry the community center.

571
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,720
Any programs that kept at-risk kids

572
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,560
from ending up in one of your prisons

573
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,000
cut into your bottom line,

574
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,600
so you took them out.

575
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,920
All right, all right. You got me.

576
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,680
No need to get physical.

577
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
So, you're confessing?

578
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,520
More like stalling.

579
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
Are you seeing this?

580
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,120
You got three guards approaching
from the west

581
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,160
and I'm reading a big energy signal.

582
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,280
That suit will protect her, right?

583
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,880
not against three of those
lightning guns it won't.

584
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,640
Nobody's home.

585
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,120
Looks like Black Mask
is tying up some loose ends.

586
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,400
I miss the electric chair,

587
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
but a firing squad should do.

588
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,160
Ready. Aim.

589
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Fire!

590
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,720
You've been holding out on me, Fox?

591
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,160
Couldn't let you have all the fun.

592
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,080
- You know I had that, right?
- Yeah. Never had a doubt.

593
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,400
<i>Do you like irony, Gotham?</i>

594
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,800
<i>I think Batwoman does.</i>

595
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,080
<i>For-profit prison CEO, Ellis O'Brien,
allegedly engineered a conspiracy</i>

596
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,120
<i>to sabotage
community outreach programs</i>

597
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,320
<i>in a bid to increase
incarceration rates</i>

598
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,200
<i>among the city's most at-risk</i>

599
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,680
<i>and it seems O'Brien did
increase the prison population</i>

600
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,720
<i>by one himself.</i>

601
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,560
<i>Batwoman spilled the tea</i>

602
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,040
<i>and journalist Horten Spence
spilled the ink.</i>

603
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,280
<i>Talk to me, Gotham.
Has Batwoman found her Lois Lane?</i>

604
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Daddy?

605
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,440
What brought you to
the good doctor rhyme's office?

606
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,040
<i>That's why I can't shake this urge</i>

607
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,160
<i>for another hit of Snakebite
because at least for a few...</i>

608
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,720
What did you do?

609
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,320
<i>That was my life's biggest regret</i>

610
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,120
<i>my greatest failure, not saving beth.</i>

611
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,400
<i>Not an hour goes by
when I don't think about it,</i>

612
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,000
<i>leaving my daughter
to suffer in that cell.</i>

613
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,560
<i>That's why I can't shake this urge
for another hit of Snakebite</i>

614
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,360
<i>because at least
for a few fleeting moments</i>

615
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,720
<i>I can be the father
I should have been to her</i>

616
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,960
<i>all those years ago.</i>

617
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,240
I'm sorry, Daddy.

618
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,080
As much as I want to forgive you...

619
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,120
Forgetting's easier.

620
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
Apply the antibiotic twice a day

621
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,360
and change the bandages
as needed.

622
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

623
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,200
My insurance doesn't kick in
for another few weeks.

624
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,080
Yeah. I'm just glad
you got your job back

625
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,600
and I hear a big promotion.

626
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,480
All I have to toast
with are lollipops

627
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,200
but cheers.

628
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,080
- Bye.
- Bye.

629
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,280
Stopped by the med school

630
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,840
your apartment, the hold-up.

631
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,040
Then it hit me
where I could find you.

632
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,000
- Busted. You got me.
- Mary.

633
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,480
Look. I don't care
what you have to say

634
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm opening the place back up,

635
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,520
So, if you want to stop me,
you'll have to arrest me.

636
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,680
I don't want to stop you.

637
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I want to help you.

638
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,080
Make this place a real clinic.

639
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,240
Hire real doctors.
I'll even pay for it.

640
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,640
You know that there
are some things that you can't fix

641
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,880
by writing a big check.

642
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,560
What possible objection
could you have

643
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,320
to making this place legit?

644
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,920
Because it goes against the very
reason I started the clinic, okay?

645
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,400
I don't ask for I.D.,
I don't require insurance,

646
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,200
I don't report O.D.s
or non-violent criminal behavior.

647
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,000
I opened up this place
to serve the people

648
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,960
that you don't see as legit.

649
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,960
Come on. You haven't
even finished med school.

650
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,760
And yet yesterday,
I saved a guy's life.

651
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,440
You know,
for the first time since Kate died

652
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,600
I don't feel hollow.

653
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,840
I feel like what I did mattered

654
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,040
that I can make a difference
in this crappy city

655
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,080
and you want to take
that away from me

656
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,320
and for that,
I will never forgive you.

657
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,920
Hey.

658
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,440
So, I heard you put
in for a transfer to Berlin.

659
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
That I did.

660
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,160
- Seems sudden.
- I know.

661
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,560
I just, I just woke up this morning

662
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,960
and knew that's
what I wanted to do.

663
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,920
It just feels right, you now?

664
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,240
too many memories here in Gotham.

665
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Take care, love.

666
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,200
Just wanted to make sure
you had a copy of this.

667
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,360
I'm glad the place
is getting some good press.

668
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,520
Yeah. The phones have
been lighting up

669
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,920
with donations and volunteers.

670
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,800
That means I'm off the hook
for teaching martial arts?

671
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,160
i hope not because I already signed
up for your class.

672
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Excuse me.

673
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,000
So, this is all
happening very quickly,

674
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,520
but the D.A. signed off
on Angelique's deal.

675
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,760
A Witsec team is moving her
into protective custody as we speak.

676
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,880
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you

677
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,000
for getting her to talk.

678
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,680
Now until we can
take down Black Mask

679
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,760
Angelique's gonna be
off the grid for bit.

680
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,080
It might be a while
before you can talk to her again.

681
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,960
You came for me!

682
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
I knew you would.

683
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,400
Crows treating you okay?

684
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,920
They're definitely more agreeable
chauffeuring me around.

685
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,240
Thanks for getting me out.

686
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,840
You got yourself out.

687
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
With a little push.

688
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,200
I don't know how you
did 18 months inside, Ry.

689
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,600
<i>I thought I understood how much
you sacrificed for me by going in.</i>

690
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,040
Not even close,

691
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,040
but now that I do,
I want to say thank you

692
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,640
and that I love you so...

693
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,160
Ang?

694
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,480
- No, no!
- What's going on? Angelique?

695
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,520
- No, no, no!
<i>- What's going on?</i>
