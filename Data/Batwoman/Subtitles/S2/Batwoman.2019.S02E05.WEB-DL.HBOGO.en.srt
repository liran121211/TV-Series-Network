1
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,120
It's all there.

2
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,840
Tell me where I can find
the Jack Napier painting.

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,480
Your painting is being held
by the collective...

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,040
private club of connoisseurs
of outlawed artwork

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
and antiquities.

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,520
You want to tie the room together
with a vintage canvas that takes you

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,480
inside the mind
of psychotic criminality?

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,000
These are the people
you need to know.

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,440
I want an introduction.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
The top crow?

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,200
Your biggest clients
are in the collective.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,400
They pay your bills.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,320
You walk up to their doorstep
trying to grab that Napier?

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,000
They're gonna ask you for a refund.

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,080
You're from Coryana.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,760
You're gonna tell Safiyah
to give my daughter back.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,160
I got a report of a guy
lurking around east end

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,480
with a spiky pole.

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,240
It doesn't concern you, Batwoman.

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,440
That so?
Because he's hanging off my line.

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,120
So, why don't you tell me
what kind of fish I caught?

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,800
There's an item I'm looking for.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,040
It's gonna help me find my daughter.

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,440
The woman holding her captive
doesn't want me to find it.

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,040
Safiyah? She sent this guy?

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,680
Weapon fits the M.O.
of her assassins.

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,920
But I'll confirm
after you hand him over now.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,960
I don't take orders from Crows...

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,080
and I got a better shot
at finding Kate Kane before you do.

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,440
"All Crows are bastards."

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,480
<i>Morning, Gotham.</i>

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,480
<i>Guess the early bird
gives us the bird.</i>

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,480
<i>Acrobatic Art Prankster Wolf Spider
was at it again,</i>

34
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
<i>rolling his eyes at the entire city</i>

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,920
<i>from the top
of the Gotham century skyscraper</i>

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,320
<i>with an iridescent emoji.</i>

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,640
<i>Millennial hacktivism at its finest</i>

38
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,160
<i>and almost enough to distract us
from an even juicier bat story.</i>

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,560
<i>Another sighting of Batwoman 2.0</i>

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,080
<i>and top crow Jacob Kane together.</i>

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,240
<i>This time, working in
the east-end crime scene.</i>

42
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,200
<i>Are we looking at Gotham's
newest power couple</i>

43
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,160
No. Jeez.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,640
I thought Batwoman was cool.

45
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,040
Hey. We don't know
what they were doing.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,960
{\an5}Maybe Batwoman was saving his ass.

47
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,680
{\an5}Thought you might be hungry
after last night's reconnecting.

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,000
{\an5}Still sleepy.

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,640
{\an5}I wish you could do something
about that.

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,360
{\an5}You can take the day off.

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,720
I can't.

52
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,760
{\an5}As cute as I look
in your ridiculous robe...

53
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,880
{\an5}I should get home and change first.

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
You "walk of shaming" for me?

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,760
Like the old days.

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,760
{\an5}Speaking of the old days...

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,320
it's time you got
that apology I owe you.

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,440
{\an5}My partying was out of control

59
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,720
and you took my stash
thinking it would help me.

60
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,360
{\an5}And instead,
it got your ass thrown in jail.

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,400
{\an5}And I get why you don't
want me to visit you.

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,640
You served 18 months for me, Ryan...

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,080
and it's time
I start paying you back.

64
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,360
One for you, one for me?

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
I love it...

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,520
but we're good.

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,160
You got your life together.
That's all I wanted.

68
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Hey. What is this?

69
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,600
- It's a work injury.
- You fall on a corkscrew?

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,760
Ryan, you need to get
that looked at.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
{\an5}Yeah. I just got this job.

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,480
{\an5}I don't need my boss
thinking I can't hack it.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,640
You tend bar. She'll understand.

74
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,680
{\an5}All these years later,
still worrying about me.

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,120
{\an5}It's kind of cute.

76
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,000
{\an5}You know, what's kind of cute?
You...

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,520
{\an5}Without that nastiness
on your shoulder.

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,640
You take care of everyone else.

79
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Take care of yourself for once.

80
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,120
{\an5}- Giving you an antibiotic.
- So, it's just an infection?

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,640
{\an5}Well, it might have turned necrotic
if you had waited any longer.

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,560
{\an5}Are you sure you're not
having any other symptoms

83
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,440
{\an5}that you're not telling me about?

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
No. I...

85
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,240
{\an5}maybe a little more tired
than normal.

86
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

87
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,680
{\an5}Kate would pop two of these

88
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,240
{\an5}and she'd be back in fighting shape.

89
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
- Okay. Cool.
- But if you're hurt...

90
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,000
you should sit out a few days.

91
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,720
Right. Did Kate ever sit out?

92
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,240
Kate was never shot with anything

93
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,040
that pierced through the batsuit...

94
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,720
{\an5}and, you shouldn't
compare yourself to her.

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,320
What's my choice?
Everybody else is.

96
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,760
{\an5}I know you don't have a Twitter,
so I assume you mean Luke.

97
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,920
Just don't tell him about this, okay?

98
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,920
{\an5}I don't need another reason
for him not to trust me.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
{\an5}He's been questioning
every decision I make.

100
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,360
Not to backseat drive,
but aren't you

101
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,760
{\an5}proficient in six different
forms of martial arts?

102
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,040
What's the point of
just leaving him here?

103
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,240
I told him we wanted
the location of Coryana.

104
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,000
He'll give it up.
Take it from a foster kid.

105
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,800
It is amazing how well you behave

106
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,240
when you are literally starving.

107
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,480
We don't have time to wait him out.

108
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,080
If Alice finds Ocean
before we find Coryana,

109
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,280
Safiyah's gonna give Kate to her,
and Alice is going to kill her.

110
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,320
Okay.
So, do your hacker thing

111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
and get some info
on the spiky pole guy

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,200
to speed this up.

113
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
I already tried.

114
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
I tracked his movements
and confirmed

115
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,040
that he wasn't after Jacob Kane.

116
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,600
He was stalking the guy
that he killed in the alley.

117
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,560
But, the victim
was an investment analyst

118
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,160
at Gotham capital with no record.

119
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,600
What's he got to do with Coryana?

120
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,280
Sir, I'm not defending her actions

121
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,640
but my guess
is, she's after what we're after...

122
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,160
Kate's location.

123
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,800
Let her keep Safiyah's thug.

124
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
We got a new lead on the Napier...

125
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Evan Blake, old friend of Kate's

126
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,720
and a fixture
on the Gotham art scene.

127
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,320
Just flew back from a trip to Berlin.

128
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,600
He was caught a couple of years ago

129
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,320
with plundered artifact
and forced to pay restitution.

130
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,240
In other words,
a likely member of the collective

131
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,680
who might cooperate.

132
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,880
Commander, you're underselling
our entire origin story.

133
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,800
Katie Kane saved my life.

134
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,600
- Really?
- Gotham prep.

135
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,280
It's eighth grade,
and the winter formal

136
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,920
is a multiverse shattering crisis
because I'm "straight".

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,120
Kate was way out by then,
I had this tragic crush...

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,720
and I asked her to the dance.

139
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
I'm sure she wanted
to roll her eyes so hard...

140
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,960
but with the grace of a saint...

141
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
she said yes.

142
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,840
The only time
you'll ever hear teenage Kate

143
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
described as a saint.

144
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,840
My parents take me to pick her up

145
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,800
and Kate is jaw-dropping
in this tailored velvet suit,

146
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,840
just radiating queer confidence.

147
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,320
I, on the other hand dissolve
into a monsoon of tears.

148
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,040
Kate races me up
to her bedroom,

149
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,240
and we go through
the whole thing.

150
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,000
"I'm gay." "I know."

151
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,040
We make it to the dance,
and I came out by default

152
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,600
because I wore
Kate's alexander McQueen

153
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,080
off-the-shoulder mini...

154
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,160
which begged a lot of questions.

155
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,360
But I wasn't afraid anymore.

156
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,440
I was glowing...

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,640
and then Kate ditched me
to make out with Maggie Watson.

158
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,000
Sounds like our girl.

159
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,040
So you need my help
with Kate's disappearance.

160
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
I'm here for you.

161
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,440
Kate was looking
for a piece of artwork...

162
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,600
something that may have gotten her

163
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,880
on the wrong side of
someone very dangerous.

164
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,680
Our theory is if we find the item

165
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,040
it will lead us to her captor.

166
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,880
Well, you've come
to the right art snob.

167
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
I was senior editor
at the Gotham Museum of Antiquities.

168
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,720
I curate my own private collections.

169
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,200
I've got my hands
in a bit of everything.

170
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Yeah. We know. Agent Moore.

171
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,320
Kate was looking for a canvas
painted by Jack Napier

172
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,480
alias the Joker.

173
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,600
You're aware of it, yes?

174
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,400
I know the legend.

175
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,080
Psychotic evildoer breaks into home.

176
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,320
Splashes homeowner's guts
all over some old painting

177
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
in the foyer and calls it modern art.

178
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,440
It's a bit on the nose if you ask me.

179
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,040
Not to mention illegal to buy, sell,
or possess

180
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,200
since it was stolen
from an active crime scene.

181
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm sorry.
Should there be a harsh light

182
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,920
shining in my eyes right now?

183
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,400
Because the Kate I knew
never gave a crap about art...

184
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,680
and I haven't spoken
with her in years.

185
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,960
We have reason to believe
that you're affiliated

186
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,160
with the collective.

187
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,560
We'll work to get you full immunity

188
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,960
if you help us make contact.

189
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,560
Immunity from what, Ms. Moore?

190
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm a perfect angel.

191
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,080
I thought you were here friend.

192
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,200
I love Katie,
but this feels like entrapment.

193
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,480
If you need to contact me again,
I'll refer you to my lawyers.

194
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,720
I want all our tech inside
every device Evan owns,

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,840
round-the-clock revolving tails.

196
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Yes, sir, but there could be
an easier way to locate Coryana

197
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
with Batwoman's help.

198
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,920
Let me ask her
for access to her prisoner.

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,160
Batwoman or whoever it is
who stepped in for my daughter,

200
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,360
I am not gonna grovel at her feet.

201
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,560
Then let me do it,
or at least ask nicely

202
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,240
because Alice will do
a lot worse than grovel

203
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,800
to find Kate before we do.

204
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,480
Ocean.

205
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Hi.

206
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
Hi.

207
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,640
What do you call it when you're sure
you've met someone...

208
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,880
You're sure you've never met?

209
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,560
A stay of execution.

210
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,560
Vodka on the rocks.

211
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,760
Visiting from Gotham?

212
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,920
Why?

213
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,120
Do I look depressed?

214
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,560
You've got the sophistication
of a city mouse.

215
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,560
Mouse.

216
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,480
Touchy subject.

217
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,440
Don't you think mice are cute?

218
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
I had a mouse in my life.

219
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,920
I loved him like a brother...

220
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
and when he started
holding me back

221
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,520
from my dreams, I killed him.

222
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Shoot.

223
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,560
I think it's my turn to...

224
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,280
That is the fastest
I've ever seen him take the hint.

225
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,440
Can I join you...

226
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,000
in case he decides to try it again?

227
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,960
Pretty sure he's in the next county
by now

228
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,280
but, by all means.

229
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,040
Last time I came here
to meet a Batwoman.

230
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
The vibes...

231
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
were different.

232
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,240
Please say this isn't a booty call.

233
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,520
Look. I don't know
where you got this idea

234
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,040
that all Crows are bastards

235
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,840
but some of us are trying
to make a difference.

236
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,360
Well, in my experience,
when the Crows fly together,

237
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,240
they call it a murder for a reason.

238
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,600
I want to offer you a deal.

239
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,480
You get everything we know
about Safiyah and Coryana,

240
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,280
and we get access to your prisoner.

241
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,880
So you can beat him
within an inch of his life?

242
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,600
He's a murderer who knows
where Kate's being held.

243
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
I'll think about it.

244
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,440
You should be doing everything
in your power to help Kate.

245
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,280
I don't need a crow
telling me how to do my job.

246
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,400
I'm not speaking to you as a crow.

247
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,240
Kate's the love of my life...

248
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,960
and I need your help to get her back.

249
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,600
Hell to the no. No.

250
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,760
Working with the Crows
makes my skin crawl.

251
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,000
- Screw that. No.
- It's not like we're hosting them

252
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,320
a fundraiser.

253
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,520
Trust me.

254
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,040
We make a deal that sounds good,
they'll break it.

255
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,760
Not if we're dealing with Sophie.

256
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,640
Sophie has hauled my ass
in for questioning

257
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,560
so many times, she knows
my damn coffee order. No.

258
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,160
Will you talk some sense into her,
please?

259
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,600
We're at a dead end, Ryan.
Look. I'm sorry...

260
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,960
but you're outvoted.

261
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,240
I get it. You want Kate back.

262
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
But the Crows have tried
to ruin my life for fun.

263
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm not helping them.

264
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Okay.

265
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
So.

266
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,120
Crows horror stories.

267
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,120
You want me to go, or...

268
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you want to do yours first?

269
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,320
My girl Angelique had a drug habit.

270
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,200
And on a very ugly night...

271
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,720
she was gone,
like a different person.

272
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,280
So I found her stash,

273
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,880
and I took it thinking
I could somehow straighten her out...

274
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
bring her back.

275
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,600
I'm on the street, crying...

276
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,720
no question what kind
of night I'm having

277
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,960
and I pass these two Crows,
and one of them yells out,

278
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,760
"you'd be cuter
with a smile on your face."

279
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,920
And my mama told me
what to do about it.

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
I pay them no mind and keep moving.

281
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
But they, they wouldn't let me go.

282
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
So my hand went out,
my finger went up, and boom,

283
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,200
those Crows had what they wanted.

284
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,400
They found the drugs
and thought they were yours.

285
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,880
Sorry that happened to you.

286
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,040
What was yours?

287
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,680
The Crows...

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,400
killed my father.

289
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,920
Wait. What?

290
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Really?

291
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,720
Really.

292
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,480
It's not a story for today, but...

293
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,920
It's the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

294
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,760
I should have let you go first.

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,440
Look. I will never forgive them...

296
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,960
and I don't want
to help the Crows either...

297
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,640
but we need them to help us.

298
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,800
Remember, this isn't punishment
just for the sake of it.

299
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,480
Given this murderer
every opportunity to talk.

300
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,240
So, unless you have any other ideas,

301
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,280
it's time to take this
to the next level.

302
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
You've got some choices.

303
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,560
You can give us the location
of Coryana...

304
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,280
You can get us in touch with Safiyah
or the man known as Ocean.

305
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,800
Help us find the Napier painting.

306
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,360
Listen to me. It is not worth
what they're gonna do to you.

307
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,400
The many arms will kill whoever
lays hands on that painting.

308
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,800
You'll never find Coryana.

309
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,760
I never said the two were related.

310
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,480
The painting gets us to Coryana?
Is it a map?

311
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
Cyanide capsule.

312
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,920
- Let's get him down.
- It's too late. It's too late.

313
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,480
Kane pushed him too hard,
and now we're at a dead end.

314
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,880
Maybe not.

315
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,840
We've been surveilling
a suspect we linked to the Napier

316
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,840
and we just got a hit
on its location.

317
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,480
A group called the Collective

318
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,680
is having
a special exhibition tomorrow night

319
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,520
to auction the painting off.

320
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Why now?

321
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,800
Word must have gotten
back to the owner

322
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,560
about the body that dropped
the other night.

323
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Too much heat.

324
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,440
You doing anything tomorrow night?

325
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,120
You looking for a date to this thing?

326
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,880
We don't have an insider.

327
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,400
But we need someone
with no connection to the Crows

328
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,080
who can infiltrate the event

329
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
and grab the Napier
without getting caught.

330
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
I go alone.

331
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,040
No Crows at the location,
no surveillance.

332
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,360
and I want you directly in charge

333
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,360
of any Crows assigned
to this mission.

334
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,160
This is a one-off.
We're not partners.

335
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,600
So, Ocean...

336
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,240
What do you do?

337
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,960
I bore people to death
by telling them

338
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm a soil technician.

339
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,000
That sounds like a fancy name
for dirt nerd.

340
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,920
but you smiled when you said it,
so...

341
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,880
you must like your work.

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,760
I grew up in nature.

343
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
My family cultivated
everything we ever needed

344
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,800
from the land.

345
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,480
In a place like Gotham,
where everything is concrete...

346
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,040
isn't that incredible?

347
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,960
So tell me...

348
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,720
where is this magical
place you hail from?

349
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,400
I'm meeting an associate.

350
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,200
Should splash some water on my face.

351
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,840
Five shots...

352
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,440
No, regrets.

353
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
Hey. Can I ask you something?

354
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,160
Have we met somewhere before?

355
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,400
Think I'd remember you.

356
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,720
Probably just thinking
about somebody else.

357
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,400
Oh, well.

358
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,800
Do you mind...

359
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,000
Shutting the shade?

360
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,360
You slept through half the day.

361
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,960
Five shots, no regrets.

362
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,520
Shall I explain?

363
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,560
I do wish you would.

364
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,840
Some lunatic on a far-away island
is holding my sister hostage

365
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,400
and she won't hand her over
until I got you

366
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,880
and air mail the evidence.

367
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,920
This woman got a name?

368
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,920
Enough women want you dead.
I need to be specific?

369
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,480
Just answer the damn question.

370
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,880
Safiyah.

371
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,640
Although her obedient
island followers call her queen.

372
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Not me.

373
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,000
I called her sister.

374
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,840
I have three words.

375
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,040
Who is she?

376
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Look.

377
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,560
Wait. Are you sure art collectors

378
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,280
are supposed to have this much swag?

379
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,320
Well, first of all,
they're not art collectors.

380
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
They're outlaws.

381
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,360
And if Evan Blake
is the style guide...

382
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,560
this party's about to look
like <i>The Hunger Games.</i>

383
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,760
What's Evan Blake's deal?

384
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
He and I were always angling
for Kate's affection.

385
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
No.

386
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,200
He was way more competitive
and had...

387
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,960
A lot more flair than me.

388
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,240
Now, he's overeducated,
and apparently...

389
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,480
he's addicted to mischief.

390
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,520
The Crows say that he runs
the door for the Collective.

391
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
No.

392
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
- Yeah.
- Okay.

393
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,840
Well, I think I can make this work.

394
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,200
I'd say so.

395
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,320
H... Hey. I, I brought the plan...

396
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,760
I... I brought the game plan.

397
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,080
The event is inside a private hangar
at Gotham international.

398
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,520
It's actually a pretty clever way
of doing this.

399
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,000
So, the Collective flies in,
they unload their pieces...

400
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,840
they buy, sell, party...

401
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
then they load back up, fly away.

402
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,560
No, customs, no TSA,
maximum security.

403
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
How are we sneaking the batsuit
through that security?

404
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,840
See, we just happen
to have VIP access

405
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,720
to every square inch
of that terminal.

406
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,720
Yeah. Between Wayne enterprises
and Hamilton dynamics...

407
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,200
we burn more private jet fuel
than the Hadids, Kardashians

408
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,920
- and the Air Force combined.
- Yeah.

409
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So with our resources,

410
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,040
Crows's intelligence,
and a secret agent

411
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,960
that no one's going
to suspect, Ryan Wilder.

412
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,480
Wait. I'm just supposed
to talk my way inside?

413
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Oh, no.

414
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,360
Did you think Mary
had all the accessories?

415
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,880
Look at this precision metalwork.
The weight is perfectly balanced.

416
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,800
What's the provenance?

417
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,800
- Which bat did it belong to?
- Woman.

418
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,120
- 1.0 or...
- Current model.

419
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,160
The Batarang is a stunning piece.

420
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,120
We'll make an exception
and allow it into the exhibition.

421
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,920
Okay. I'm really loving that dress.

422
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,360
- Didn't it debut in London?
- Nailed it.

423
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,640
Actually, it was New York,
winter '18.

424
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,200
Well, I heard there was a dress code
so I borrowed it from a friend.

425
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,240
Heard from who, exactly?

426
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,760
Of course, I'm a big believer
in the first amendment

427
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,600
except when it comes
to the shenanigans that go on

428
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,640
behind the Collective's closed doors.

429
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,960
Evan baby...

430
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,080
what are you doing to my girl here?

431
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,320
You beat me here.

432
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,480
Ang, big night.
Patrons need their party favors.

433
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,880
And this one's yours?

434
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,560
Yeah.
I totally spaced on the heads up.

435
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,320
It's fine. You're forgiven.

436
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,160
Any questions?

437
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
Pronouns?

438
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,440
He, him, they, them.

439
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,280
I go with the flow.

440
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,000
Now, you two, go forth and do crimes.

441
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,520
- Ang, what are you doing here?
- Saving your ass at the door.

442
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,160
You can't just slide into the DM.

443
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,320
You need a referral.

444
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
What party favors
was he talking about?

445
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,600
Ang, no.

446
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,720
What do you want me to say?

447
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,120
That you weren't
lying through your teeth

448
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
when you told me
you'd pulled your life together.

449
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,360
For your information,
I'm clean.

450
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,560
Four months, but do you know
what people need

451
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,240
to pull their lives together?

452
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Money.

453
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,160
If you get caught,

454
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,520
distribution is eight-10
at Blackgate.

455
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,760
Says the girl turning
Batwoman's missing hardware

456
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,120
into an Etsy shop.

457
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,840
We know what I'm doing here.
What are you doing here?

458
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Save it.

459
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,200
You are the only one here
who's judging.

460
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,600
- Is this thing on?
- Loud and clear.

461
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,720
Want to try channel two?

462
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,800
No, not really.

463
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,440
- Batwoman to Moore.
- Copy. You're late.

464
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,200
Thought maybe you got cold feet.

465
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,920
Believe it or not, I ran into an ex.

466
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,240
Okay.
Well, I hope he's not gonna be drama.

467
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,560
She, and always.

468
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,320
<i>Let you know
when I find the painting.</i>

469
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
<i>Stand by.</i>

470
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,720
Luke, got the target.

471
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay. Great.

472
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,400
Give me a good look.

473
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,800
Okay.
Moving on to the next phase.

474
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,800
A lot of interest in this one.

475
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,600
Yeah.

476
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,920
It's kind of gimmicky, isn't it?

477
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
Oh, it's dreadful, zero technique.

478
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,880
But, you know, celebrity artists.

479
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,760
Help me to understand the appeal
in owning something like this.

480
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,480
Some of the people here?
Total sickos.

481
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
And you?

482
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,160
I don't like being told
what I can and can't do in life.

483
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,120
Whether it's the art I collect
or the clothes I wear...

484
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,400
I'm not desperate
for anyone's approval.

485
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,680
Still throwing shade
at my borrowed couture.

486
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,040
What can I say?

487
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,120
I just prefer
to see everyone's true colors.

488
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,520
So I ran a spectral analysis
to isolate the original canvas

489
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,680
underneath the Gore.

490
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,760
I think it's a painting
of Ocean currents. You were right.

491
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,400
The Joker splattered some poor guy
all over a map to Coryana?

492
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,240
But we'll need to restore the canvas
to locate the island.

493
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,360
- But that means...
- You're gonna need to steal it.

494
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,240
I didn't know Safiyah had family.

495
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,120
We weren't blood.

496
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,080
Apparently, we weren't anything.

497
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,040
- Why does she want me dead?
- Oh, no offense,

498
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,440
but I have way too much drama
in my life to care.

499
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,440
She's obviously losing her touch
if she sent you.

500
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,440
I'm sorry.
Did you just call me a bad assassin?

501
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,800
Not to Monday morning quarterback...

502
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,160
but you had ample opportunity
to kill me.

503
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
You knew I was staying here

504
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,880
which means
you could have killed me in my sleep.

505
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,280
But, maybe you don't know
how to pick a lock.

506
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,520
Fine. Surprise attack
in the bar bathroom.

507
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,160
Easy, private.

508
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,280
At the very least,
you can ambush me in my truck.

509
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,760
I have a backseat,
and I don't lock my doors.

510
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,600
But instead, you,
what, make a scene at the bar...

511
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,080
get my attention...

512
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,760
indulge in small talk? Get drunk?

513
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,400
Safiyah must be desperate
if she sent you.

514
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,200
I needed more answers
before I could kill you.

515
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,960
I've never seen you
before in my life.

516
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,640
Nor I you, which is why
I needed to know more

517
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,800
before I made Ocean
bleed the red sea.

518
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,600
How do you even know
what Coryana looks like?

519
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,600
Because I was there five years ago.

520
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,520
That's impossible.

521
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,440
I was there five years ago.

522
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,680
How peculiar.

523
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,040
Well, I suppose you could kill me

524
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,680
and then spend the rest
of your life on the run...

525
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,440
seeing as none
of this changes the fact

526
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,560
the island queen
still wants you dead.

527
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,720
Or, we could give her a jingle.

528
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,200
I'm good with option "A".

529
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,040
Safiyah, we both know
this isn't about a stupid flower.

530
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,760
And what do you think it's about?

531
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,680
Me having the one thing you can't.

532
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,640
- What the hell was that?
- Exactly.

533
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,280
Option "B" it is.

534
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,800
There should be
a dispenser next to the sink with...

535
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,480
You know, products.

536
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,720
I see it.

537
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,840
A lot of firepower in that room,

538
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
so you're gonna have to move fast.

539
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,320
Batwoman, status check. You find it?

540
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,800
Target identified.
I just need to take it

541
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,120
for further analysis.

542
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,680
We'll monitor from here.

543
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Batwoman?

544
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,320
I think we have competition.

545
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,680
<i>- Who?</i>
- You ever heard of Wolf Spider?

546
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,600
Shoot him
before he gets too high.

547
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,960
- Miss, Miss, this way, please.
- No. Ryan!

548
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
Hand it over.

549
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Damn.

550
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,120
Painting's on the move.

551
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,440
Do you need medical?

552
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
Just slow him down. I'll be there.

553
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
We're on it.

554
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Nimble little bastard.

555
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,720
Little taser action
will slow him down.

556
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,880
- Damn it! Get me closer.
- I'm on it.

557
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,160
Fricking cartridge is jammed.

558
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,320
- Dude, what did you do?
- He jumped in front of me.

559
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,400
Get some ties on him.

560
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,080
This isn't good. Call for medical.

561
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,880
<i>Status check.</i>

562
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,320
Target acquired. We got the painting.

563
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,240
- Let's go.
- What? What are you doing?

564
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,480
We can't leave him here.

565
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,880
Moore wants the painting,
not an excessive force headline.

566
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Let's go.

567
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,920
Someone else will clean him up.

568
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,720
Evan?

569
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,600
Evan!
Evan, can you hear me?

570
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,960
We're gonna need
a blood drive after this.

571
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,240
- He's gonna recover, right?
- Well, considering he was

572
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
hip-checked
by a 4,800-pound hunk

573
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,080
of toxic masculinity...

574
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,720
he's doing great.

575
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,720
Distal femur fracture,
dislocated elbow,

576
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,120
minor concussion...

577
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,880
but when the bone shattered,
it nicked his femoral artery.

578
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,840
So if you hadn't been there
to bring him in in time...

579
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,440
he would have bled out.

580
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,520
Okay. What...
what happened back there?

581
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,280
You want to know what happened?

582
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,720
I listened to you over my gut,
and now look.

583
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,960
I meant what happened to you?

584
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,160
You sounded
like you were in rough shape.

585
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,360
- You called for backup.
- This isn't about me.

586
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,280
This is about us...

587
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,800
this team
and how I can't keep working

588
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,040
for your approval.

589
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,000
I wanted to suit up and not think

590
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,360
about you comparing me
to Kate Kane for once.

591
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,560
So I agreed to partner
with the Crows.

592
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
And for what?

593
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,240
You sided with the guys
who killed your old man.

594
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,800
Your taste sucks.

595
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,400
But you know what?

596
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,960
I wear the suit, I take the bullets.

597
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,560
So when I say I have
a bad feeling about something...

598
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,800
you two listen.

599
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,480
Did Her Majesty say when she'd
grace us with a callback?

600
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,640
Would you just sit there
without talking?

601
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,080
I have spent more years of my life

602
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,720
in captivity than any elephant
in the Gotham zoo.

603
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,840
The key to surviving,
keep yourself entertained.

604
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Rough childhood?

605
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,600
You could say I come
by my abandonment issues

606
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,800
honestly, yeah.

607
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,640
How do you know Safiyah?

608
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,680
I was squatting on a yacht
in Gotham harbor.

609
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,000
Safiyah's minions were pirating it
while I was on board

610
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,680
and apparently, she was impressed
by the fight I put up.

611
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,280
And she let you stay?

612
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,960
- Yeah.
- No way.

613
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,440
The island's cardinal rule
is no outsiders.

614
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,120
Why don't I remember
any of this?

615
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,240
That's the thing.

616
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,560
You should,
and I should remember you.

617
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,680
The fact that we both have
the same memories

618
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,680
makes me think
that Safiyah did something to...

619
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,800
Get us to forget.

620
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,160
You think Safiyah
erased our memory?

621
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Some of them.

622
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,080
The thing is we might never know.

623
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,280
Tell me you ordered delivery
and those aren't

624
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,480
One, two, three
assassins approaching.

625
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,600
The Many Arms of Death.

626
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,840
More relatives of yours, I presume.

627
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,520
Yeah. Can you cut me loose?

628
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
I can't trust you.

629
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
You don't trust me to defend myself

630
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,680
from murder?

631
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,040
- Where's Ocean?
- Hey.

632
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Surprise.

633
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,040
Hey. Do you have any cash?

634
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,960
We should probably leave
the maid a tip.

635
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,320
You're dark.

636
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,840
Shouldn't have doubted me.
Let's go. You're driving.

637
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,600
Badges of the Crows who did this.

638
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,720
That's not enough.

639
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,480
Burn it all down, girl.
The whole thing.

640
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,400
I can't do that.

641
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,680
I believe in the mission
of the Crows.

642
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,920
An organization
that decides what justice is

643
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,400
based on who can pay
the most money?

644
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,120
That beats information
out of its suspects?

645
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,680
That runs someone over
for stealing a painting?

646
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,880
That's what you believe in?

647
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,280
You think two men losing
their jobs isn't enough?

648
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
You're right.

649
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,080
But I'm fighting
to change the culture.

650
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,600
Yeah?
Well, good luck with that.

651
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,280
But if you want to party with me,

652
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,800
add your badge
to that little pile over there.

653
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,240
Until then,
this partnership is over.

654
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,640
What about the painting?

655
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,480
Our forensics team
is still working on it.

656
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,360
Don't you want to know
where Coryana is?

657
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,120
We'll see who gets there first.

658
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,200
Mary Hamilton.

659
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,920
Awkward.

660
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,680
Because I know you're Wolf Spider?

661
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,520
Because I'm pretty sure I'm naked.

662
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,280
Oh, very much so.

663
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,160
Evan, you need to find a better suit.

664
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,720
Spandex is no match
for an oncoming SUV.

665
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
But it's so comfortable.

666
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,920
Then, maybe find a safer excuse
to play dress-up.

667
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,720
Gotham's elite
take themselves too seriously.

668
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,640
Who else is gonna eye-roll them
with as much style as me?

669
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,080
The Crows got the painting.

670
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,480
I was stealing it for Kate.

671
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,560
Thought I had a better chance
at grabbing it

672
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
than the Crows.

673
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,960
Hey.
Don't beat yourself up about it

674
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,520
because it turns out nobody actually
got the Napier painting.

675
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,720
It was a forgery.

676
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,400
- That's impossible.
- No.

677
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,680
Batwoman took a sample
of the organic compound

678
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,640
that was painted over
the original canvas

679
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,200
and it was pig's blood.

680
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,440
Napier would've never
used pig's blood.

681
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Right.

682
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,440
So the Crows ended up
with a decoy copy,

683
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,600
and the original
is still out there somewhere.

684
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,880
And so is Kate.

685
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,560
Oh, my God.

686
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,120
Once we get some distance
from the many arms,

687
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,720
we can try to figure out
what Safiyah did to us and why.

688
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,400
Looks like you're not as fast
as you think, buddy boy.

689
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,560
They got you pretty bad back there.

690
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,040
Hey. You all right?

691
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah. Eyes on the road.

692
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,040
What's with you?

693
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,880
Nothing.

694
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,080
Can you check in the back real quick?

695
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,200
Is there a white tube back there?

696
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Yeah.

697
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,360
What is this?

698
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,880
You ever hear of a guy
called Jack Napier?
