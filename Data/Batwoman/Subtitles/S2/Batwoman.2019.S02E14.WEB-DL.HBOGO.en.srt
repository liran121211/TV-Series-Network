1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,840
You.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,520
How are you...

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,840
Your eyes.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,280
You have our father's eyes.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,400
Kate.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,320
Who?

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,840
Kate, it's me Alice.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,280
God, you talk a lot.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,840
I come bearing concealer.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,280
Oh, my god.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Circe.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,040
You brought my Circe back to me.

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,680
You've earned your freedom.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Go.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,120
I think I should stay,

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,640
you know, make sure
the skin sticks to the musculature.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,680
I wouldn't want dear Circe to prune.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,560
I run a cosmetics empire.
She'll be fine.

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,160
You, on the other hand,
will be minus one tongue

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,520
should you utter a single word
of what you've seen here tonight.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
My men will see you out.

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Daddy.

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,560
She's kind of creeping me out.

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,560
Yes. We're all confused.

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
Why are you still here?

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Consider me a memory.

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,680
What is this, the smurf edition?

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
It's supposed to be red and yellow.

29
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Cooks made a couple modifications.

30
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,040
Damn, bitch.

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,880
Call me a bitch again.

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
On second thought...

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Hello?

34
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
{\an5}I just want to help you.

35
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Shut up.

36
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Okay?

37
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
No judgment.

38
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,880
<i>When Jesus talked
about those who eat my flesh,</i>

39
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,560
<i>I'm pretty sure this
is not what he meant.</i>

40
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,800
<i>A cannibalistic churchgoer
tried taking a bite</i>

41
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,320
<i>out of the bat last night
after gnawing a hole</i>

42
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,520
<i>through a fellow parishioner.</i>

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
<i>Talk to me, Gotham.</i>

44
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,800
<i>How many of these zombified zealots
are out there?</i>

45
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,000
<i>Because I, for one, am hoping
this was their last supper.</i>

46
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,680
{\an5}Thank you so much.
That money will go directly

47
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,920
toward our new computer lab.

48
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
You see this?

49
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
In person.

50
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,880
{\an5}I'm never eating spaghetti again.

51
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
{\an5}This wasn't at the church.

52
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
A disemboweled body was found
at amusement mile this morning.

53
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,960
{\an5}So, what, there's more than one
flesh-eating zombie in this city?

54
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
I think we should wrap it up
and go figure this out.

55
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Oh, hell, no.

56
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,240
{\an5}Let the GCPD deal with that.

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,080
{\an5}Look. Black folks
and horror do not mix.

58
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
Okay. Some woman just donated
a literal basketball court.

59
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,240
{\an5}Look at you making it rain
With other people's money.

60
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,600
- What's up, Imani?
- Hey. How's your mom?

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
My mom?

62
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,600
{\an5}Because she broke her ankle
last night at work

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,920
which is why I took you to her office

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
so that you could drive her car home.

65
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,960
Right. Sorry, Mom's fine.

66
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,440
{\an5}You know,
rest, ice, compress, elevate.

67
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,040
{\an5}Good. Good.
Ryan made it sound way worse.

68
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
{\an5}I'm sure she did.

69
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,720
Anyway, I should go schmooze.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,360
Maybe there's a tennis
court somewhere in here.

71
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Thank you.

72
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
- You look cute.
- Thank you.

73
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,600
{\an5}I had to bail on Imani last night.

74
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Yeah, I got that. Weird lie though.

75
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,520
What the hell is this?

76
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,960
You're blocking a hydrant, buddy.

77
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Thank you.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,480
All right, whatever.
Let's just do this.

79
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
How did Kate date?

80
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
Terribly. Why do you think
she was so broody all the time?

81
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,200
Okay, but I don't brood

82
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,920
so we're gonna have
to figure something out.

83
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,520
Well, welcome to the glamorous life
of double identities.

84
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Most people you care about

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,320
are only gonna get to know
one of you

86
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,880
so either step up your lying game

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,080
or get your brood on.

88
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Welcome, officers. Can I help you?

89
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,040
Got a call about a noise complaint.

90
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
What is this?

91
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
It's a fundraiser

92
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
for the Sheldon Park
Community Center.

93
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Explains it.

94
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Explains what?

95
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,480
Why you people are so loud.

96
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
You people?

97
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,400
Need to see a permit for the noise.

98
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,680
I'm the manager. Is there a problem?

99
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,800
They want a permit.

100
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,320
We don't have a permit.

101
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,720
It's a bar. We're allowed to be open.

102
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,880
Not according to her.
It's a fundraiser.

103
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,880
So, if you don't have
the proper paperwork

104
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,040
you got two choices.

105
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,800
You can shut it down

106
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,720
or you can pay a $2,500 fine
and a mark on your liquor license.

107
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,040
Really? This is Gotham freaking City.

108
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,880
There isn't a bigger crime
happening right now

109
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,320
besides a bunch of black
and brown folks

110
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,440
Dancing to pop hits?

111
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,600
Okay, officers, it's not a big deal.

112
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,880
We are more than willing to turn
the music down, so...

113
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,600
We don't have to turn anything down.

114
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,040
The music has been the same level
it always has been.

115
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,520
And we apologize for that, Ryan.

116
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,480
Okay. So, we're fine.
We're cool. Thank you.

117
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,920
Screw that, Luke.

118
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,040
They came in here
trying to start stuff

119
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,200
because god forbid too many
of us gather together.

120
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,160
- I need you to come down...
- Don't touch me.

121
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,440
What are you doing?

122
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,680
Hey, get off of me!

123
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,840
Stop it! Stop!

124
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
My god! Stop!

125
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,840
You have the right to remain silent.

126
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,120
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

127
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,320
You have the right to an attorney.

128
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,520
If you cannot afford one,

129
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,640
then one will be
appointed for you by the court.

130
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
What is all this?

131
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,160
Party's over.

132
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,320
I can see that. Where's the manager?

133
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,040
In the paddy on her way downtown.

134
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,360
What? What the hell happened here?

135
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,040
I said the party's over.

136
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Got it.

137
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,520
Apparently,
for noise and capacity violations.

138
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,080
Okay. Well, I assume
the security cameras will confirm.

139
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,280
Are you accusing me
of falsifying my report?

140
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,040
Trust me. That's a lot better
than what I should be

141
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
accusing you of right now.

142
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,320
Ma'am, there's no need
to get aggressive.

143
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,440
Aggressive? I'm a Crow
who knows what she's talking about.

144
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Look.

145
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,600
Quit wasting my time,
or I'll have you removed.

146
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I would love to see
how that works out for you.

147
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,120
- Do you know Mary's cell?
- No.

148
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,520
- What about the clinic?
- No.

149
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,600
Who actually knows people's numbers
by heart anymore?

150
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,920
Do you really think
that's helping anything?

151
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,040
Excuse me, Mr.-Pardon-us-officer.

152
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
We'll turn the music
all the way down.

153
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,040
Okay. What exactly would you like
to say to me right now?

154
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,040
We could have used your backup.

155
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,880
Yeah. I was your backup,

156
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,720
but, no, excuse me for trying to
defuse the situation peacefully.

157
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,680
Peacefully? That's a privilege.

158
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
A priv...

159
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,880
A privilege. Okay.

160
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,000
Ryan, I'm sure that you think
that growing up with rich white kids

161
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,640
taught me how to play nice,

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,400
but it taught me
how to keep my head down.

163
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,280
There is a difference.
I don't just run into fights

164
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
when I know I can't win.

165
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,240
Okay. How about we just focus
on getting out of here?

166
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Yeah.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,480
Sophie.
I could call the Crows hotline

168
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,640
and see if they can connect me.

169
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah.
That's definitely going to voicemail.

170
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
What?

171
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,000
What is happening to me?

172
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,800
Hi. Hey, hey, hey.

173
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,240
Back off.

174
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,160
Something's wrong.
I know I don't know you,

175
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,320
but for some reason,
I just want to eat your face off.

176
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I...

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,320
I don't know what's happening to me.

178
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
- Just run.
- What?

179
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,200
No, go. Run! Go! Get out of here!

180
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,480
How did I just do that?

181
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Easy, brother.

182
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,360
Oh, my god. Okay. Listen.

183
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,280
I took a hit of Snakebite,
and it did something crazy to me.

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,200
I need medics
in the alley off Grand Avenue.

185
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,240
- I need help.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

186
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,560
I just want to help you through this.

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,400
Did you tell him you were a Crow?

188
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,800
Yes. He didn't believe me.

189
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,240
Damn. Even the Crow-card
didn't work?

190
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,480
Okay. For the record,
I wasn't playing a card.

191
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
He needed to know
that I knew what I was talking about.

192
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,320
Okay, but we all know
if you had been wearing your uniform,

193
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,840
you wouldn't be sitting
with us right now.

194
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
And we all know
if you hadn't touched a cop,

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,880
he'd have no reason
to play the assault-card.

196
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,360
Are you saying
it's my fault I'm in here?

197
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,000
No, but in the cop's mind, it is.

198
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,640
It's like whenever I think
we're getting somewhere

199
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,560
you remind you will always be
a Crow first.

200
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,840
These conversations
are always so awkward, Dr. Rhyme

201
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,960
but I think it's time that I moved on,
you know, found a new therapist

202
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,000
someone who actually
had my best interests in mind.

203
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,160
Someone who would mention
in my therapy sessions

204
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,880
to erase my sister from my memory
that she's actually alive.

205
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,640
And not only alive
but brainwashed by you

206
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,240
into believing
that she's some dead girl

207
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
named Circe Sionis.

208
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,880
Needless to say, Dr. Rhyme

209
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,000
you're fired.
Now, I couldn't tell you about Kate.

210
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,520
Roman would have tortured me
to death.

211
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,480
I was, I was hedging my bets.

212
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,480
Oh. So it's... it's Roman
that you're afraid of.

213
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,520
Tell me how to break the spell,
so I can get Kate back.

214
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
It's not that simple.

215
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,360
I merely grazed Ocean's arm

216
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,080
and all my memories of him
started to return.

217
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,400
Because I simply removed Ocean
from your subconscious.

218
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,720
Your sister underwent days
of uninterrupted hypnosis.

219
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,760
For her to embrace another persona

220
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,880
I had to shatter her psyche
into a million pieces.

221
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,880
Help me not to kill you right now.

222
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,560
Find me something of hers

223
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
something simple

224
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,560
something uniquely Kate-Kate.

225
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,400
That will rattle a core memory.

226
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Bring it to me

227
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
and we'll go from there.

228
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Is this necessary?

229
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,520
You were 10 chest compressions away
from full-blown flat lining

230
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,280
so I'm keeping you for observation.

231
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,960
Mary, I feel fine.

232
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,240
Then you can tell me
what the hell is going on.

233
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,920
I was attacked in my car
by some false face thugs.

234
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,240
They, they injected me
to make a point.

235
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,960
"Stop messing with us."

236
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
I'm not your daughter right now.
I'm your doctor

237
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,160
and I counted 16 track marks
on your arms and legs

238
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,760
so this wasn't just one time.

239
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,680
What is going on with you?

240
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,920
Help. Help. Help.

241
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I need your help.

242
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Here!

243
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Who are you?

244
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,560
My name's Richard Monaghan

245
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,280
but you're gonna know me as the guy
who's gonna try to eat you alive.

246
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
Finally.

247
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Ocean.

248
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Not a good time.

249
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,400
Fresh bullet wound.

250
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,680
What are you doing here?

251
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
I've been waiting
for you to come back.

252
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,600
- Where have you been?
- Black Mask's wine cellar.

253
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,680
It's... it's a long story.

254
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
I got to go.

255
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,920
Hey. Hey, hey.

256
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,440
I've been down here for two days
waiting for you to show up.

257
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
What's going on?

258
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Trust me.

259
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,000
You don't want to deal with this.

260
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,600
Would I be here if that were true?

261
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Hey.

262
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
You can talk to me.

263
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Kate's alive.

264
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Hey.

265
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,840
Want to tell me
what you took besides Snakebite?

266
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,560
Nothing. I swear to god.

267
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,440
Then I should just be seeing
the psilocybin from the mushrooms

268
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,320
and the diethylamide
from the fear toxin,

269
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,560
but your readings look
like a Latin midterm from hell.

270
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Mephedrone causes panic attacks,
mood swings, and violent episodes,

271
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,520
and your glucose levels
are weirdly high,

272
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,120
which could explain
the insatiable hunger sort of.

273
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,600
Why do I want to eat people?

274
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,200
I am still working on that.

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,160
How did this happen?

276
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,720
Were you bitten or something?

277
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,040
No, no. I took some weird
new version of Snakebite.

278
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,920
How'd you know about this place?

279
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,160
She helped my friend from the gym
with a heroin O.D.

280
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,120
What do you mean
by new version of Snakebite?

281
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,320
It was blue.

282
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,920
They're usually red and yellow.

283
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,400
It looked off. I don't know.

284
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
I didn't really care.

285
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,480
Just wanted to get my fix.

286
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
I just wanted to see her.

287
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Who?

288
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
My wife.

289
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
The love of my life.

290
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,760
She died in a car crash

291
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,680
before we really even got a chance
to know each other

292
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,320
and the Snakebite changed that.

293
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,480
It lets me sit down with her

294
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,040
and, you know, have those
meaningful conversations.

295
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,960
Gave me a do-over.

296
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
I think it's important
to so see people of color

297
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,840
especially black people,
in law enforcement.

298
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,160
I know it's a flawed system

299
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,000
but I also know I can make it better.

300
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
How?

301
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,520
Because I grew up
in a community policed

302
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,280
by people
who didn't look like me,

303
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,240
and now I have the power
to change that.

304
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,960
I want to show little black girls
that they can go to top-tier schools

305
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,200
and stand up to bullies
and be trusted

306
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,240
to make life-and-death decisions.

307
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
And I admire that.

308
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,560
I really do,

309
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,320
but, Sophie,
the Crows are just the wall

310
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,880
between the one percent and reality.

311
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,760
I risk my life every day

312
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,440
face exposed to the world
to protect this city.

313
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
You know that.

314
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,600
So do not sit there
and tell me that's not brave.

315
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,320
Heh. You can choose when to be Ryan

316
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,920
and when to be Batwoman.

317
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
I don't have that option.

318
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,120
I am Sophie Moore in that uniform,
and I am Sophie Moore out of it

319
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,120
for better or for worse.

320
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,560
I can't just turn it off.

321
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
Look, Ryan.

322
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
We get it.

323
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,320
You know,
life hasn't been easy for you.

324
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,600
But none of ours has.

325
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,160
I'm sorry I got heated.

326
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We're all heated, girl,

327
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
but that's how we burn it down.

328
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,320
- All right. Come on. Let's go.
- Come on.

329
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,040
If I was gonna a steal a car,
would it really be a station wagon?

330
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Let's go.

331
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,320
Grand theft auto. You?

332
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,040
Literally nothing.

333
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,640
Cops, man.
Always trying to hold us down.

334
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Us?

335
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,280
Those deprived of our justice
and freedom.

336
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,120
Power to the people.

337
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,360
Oh, god. Oh, my god.

338
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,920
At least we're safer in here
than we are out there, right?

339
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,040
Why? what's happening?

340
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,240
You haven't heard?

341
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,520
Gotham's been taken over by zombies.

342
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,680
4612 to base.

343
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,560
We have a major problem down here.

344
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,160
We have a 10- 33 out to Batwoman.

345
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,840
All available officers respond
to an incident downtown.

346
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,720
Another attack reported
at 3rd and banks.

347
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Freaking things are everywhere.

348
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,160
Where the hell's Batwoman?

349
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
We need to get out of here.

350
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Wilder, Fox, Moore, clear out.

351
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Wait, Imani. You did this?

352
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,520
A civil rights attorney
is in the lobby

353
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,480
handing out three counts
of unlawful arrest

354
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,320
racial discrimination, and assault.

355
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,640
That's right. Stick it to the man.

356
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,360
Thank you. Seriously.

357
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,920
It shouldn't have happened
in the first place

358
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,560
but on the plus side,

359
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,560
my night just opened up. Yours?

360
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
Ryan.

361
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,200
There's this thing I have to do.

362
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Sounds important.

363
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,960
I'm sorry, Imani.

364
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
It's cool.

365
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
I'll see you when a see you.

366
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Still hungry.

367
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
I need more gauze.

368
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,800
When'd you learn how to suture?

369
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,400
Twenty years in the military.

370
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,280
Bed three needs a transfusion.

371
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,440
Fridge is in the corner,
alphabetical order.

372
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,000
So, you chose the zombie apocalypse
to turn off your phone?

373
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
I'll explain later.

374
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,520
I take it you're watching the news.

375
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,600
More like the news is here.

376
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,880
My clinic is filled
with people missing chunks

377
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
of their bodies.

378
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Any idea who's attacking them?

379
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,840
Users of a bad batch of Snakebite.

380
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,280
The chemical makeup changed.

381
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,160
False face
doesn't know how to make it

382
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
without Angelique and Ocean.

383
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,520
New cooks must have improvised.

384
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,400
Well, whatever it is, it's resulted

385
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,160
In a mephedrone spike so intense

386
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,880
That it's actually changed
the composition of their pupils.

387
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,880
Snakebite accesses
the brain's memory storage

388
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
in the hippocampus.

389
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,800
I think this new recipe
makes people crave memories

390
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,800
but thanks
to some major synaptic misfirings

391
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,240
someone else's memories.

392
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,760
And that's why they're eating brains.

393
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,680
I think I know how to fix this.

394
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,040
Listen up.
This new strain of Snakebite

395
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
is killing people.

396
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,240
Our task
is to seize all paraphernalia

397
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,720
and to subdue any users
with nonlethal force

398
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,320
until we can figure out a treatment.

399
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,960
All the attacks occurred
within a four-block radius

400
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,200
of Gotham Presbyterian.

401
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,320
We think the original batch
targeted the addicts

402
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
squatting in that church.

403
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,960
As in Gotham Presbyterian

404
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Outside Crows district?

405
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Inside or outside Crows districts,
these are innocent citizens.

406
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Kane issue this order?

407
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,840
The commander
isn't answering his phone

408
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
at the moment.

409
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,280
So, he probably doesn't know
that you were just arrested?

410
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,560
Shouldn't you at least take
the day off

411
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,920
just to wash away
the jailhouse stench first, Moore?

412
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,880
That's acting commander,
as in your boss.

413
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,600
Want to test the limits
of what that means, Tavaroff?

414
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,760
All right.
Let's kick some zombie ass, boys.

415
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,240
According to Mary,
a controlled dose of clonazepam

416
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,360
will sedate brain activity

417
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,200
which will neutralize
the effects of the mephedrone

418
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,120
and force the bad Snakebite
out of their systems.

419
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,440
Okay. So how do we dose
that many people all at once?

420
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
At once?

421
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,360
Please tell me that's a gas gun.

422
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Not exactly.

423
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,560
You have to inject each person
one at a time.

424
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,120
- But that means...
- You're about to get up close

425
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,760
and personal
to some truly nasty cannibals.

426
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,480
I thought you came back to kill her.

427
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,200
What, now you're her lackey?

428
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
Something like that.

429
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,640
I take it you found something
of Kate's

430
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,560
that I can use to unlock her.

431
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Quite literally.

432
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,680
The keys to her motorcycle.

433
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You see...

434
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,320
I was the first to walk, talk,
wear a training bra

435
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,880
but when it came to riding bikes

436
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,120
my dear sister was finally first.

437
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,400
Kate loved her stupid bike

438
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,080
and these were the keys
to her one as an adult

439
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
a red triumph.

440
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,120
And what core feeling
will her motorcycle keys provoke?

441
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Freedom.

442
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,760
Kate rode her motorcycle to be free.

443
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,560
Fee from the burden
of protecting this city

444
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,160
free from my father's
overbearing grip

445
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,440
free from the burden
of having to save her...

446
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,600
irredeemable sister.

447
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
It's promising.

448
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
But...

449
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,160
My clients come to me

450
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,640
hoping I can reverse their loved ones.

451
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,000
Dementia, Alzheimer's.

452
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,000
I warn them
that with restored memory...

453
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,400
comes a flood of remembered pain

454
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,080
sorrow, and hatred.

455
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,920
My smartest clients
eventually realize

456
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
that their loved ones' lost memories

457
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,920
were possibly the best thing
that could have happened

458
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
to the both of them.

459
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,680
Do you understand that, Alice?

460
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,200
You won't be getting back
the sister you want.

461
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,480
You'll be getting back
the girl smart enough

462
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,800
to lock up a psychopath in Arkham.

463
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,560
Answer the question!

464
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Will it work?

465
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Yes.

466
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,360
Between the keys
and Kate's trigger word,

467
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
I'm optimistic.

468
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,240
I'm sorry.
What trigger word?

469
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,480
This item will help her to remember

470
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,640
Who she is at heart,

471
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,760
but unlocking her brain
is like decrypting a computer.

472
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You need a password.

473
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
What is it?

474
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,040
No, no, no.

475
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Run!

476
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,800
Okay, everyone. keep your chill.

477
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,720
I'm here to try to get you help.

478
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,920
Seriously, guys, I am not here
to kick your ass... booty

479
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,920
but I will if I have to.

480
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
Bat cave to Batwoman. Status check.

481
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
All good.

482
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,560
Tavaroff, why do I hear gunfire?

483
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,000
Tavaroff, do you copy? Hold fire.

484
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,360
Sorry, commander.
They were a lost cause.

485
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,840
Let's find whatever Snakebite
they left.

486
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
Let's wrap this up.

487
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Thank you for this.

488
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
I don't know
what I would have done without you.

489
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Don't thank me.

490
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,760
None of these people
would be alive right now

491
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,480
if it weren't for you
and this clinic.

492
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,120
You wanted to see Kate
and Beth again, didn't you?

493
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,280
That's why you kept using.

494
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,920
The Snakebite let you redo all
of the mistakes you made with them

495
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,560
and gave you a do-over.

496
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,880
Yeah. You're right.

497
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
I wanted to see Kate and Beth again.

498
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,080
What do you want me to say, Dad?

499
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,760
Do you want me to feel sorry for you?

500
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,360
You don't think
that I wanted a do-over?

501
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,080
I lost all the same people
that you did.

502
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,120
I feel the same pain
that you do every day,

503
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
every night.

504
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,240
Because I lost everything too

505
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,400
except I'm not trying to escape it.

506
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,800
I'm trying to learn
how to live with it

507
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,800
because apparently
I was dumb enough

508
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,840
to think that you would
do the same thing for me.

509
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,560
You want so badly to live

510
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,640
in this fantasy
with the two daughters that you lost

511
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,440
that you can't see
that you are losing

512
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,400
the one daughter you have left.

513
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Oh, my god.

514
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,920
Get the hell away from us.

515
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,880
Go on. get the hell away.

516
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,720
Hey, hey. Hey. You got any food?

517
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,960
You got any food? I'm so hungry.

518
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Hey. Somebody give me some food?

519
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
- Hey!
- Fee...

520
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,240
10.33 to Medina.
I got one in the alley.

521
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Copy. En route.

522
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Hands in the air.

523
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Now!

524
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
You're gonna be okay, buddy.

525
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
Easy.

526
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,680
Easy. We're gonna get you some help.

527
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,760
Should have stopped me
when you had the chance.

528
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,320
That was way too close.

529
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Thank god you were here.

530
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,440
You're lucky. Almost didn't make it.

531
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,880
The GCPD reportedly located
a false face hideout

532
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,360
storing what they believe
is the last bad Snakebite batch.

533
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,400
authorities say there were
22 victims in total

534
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,520
and thank the quick action
by the Crows

535
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,120
for keeping the death toll
from being even higher.

536
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
Who wants shots?

537
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Can we have shots, please?

538
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,120
Thank you. Yeah. I'll take all these.

539
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,600
Thanks.

540
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,560
Actually, I'm gonna need all of these
after the day I've had.

541
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
I'm out.

542
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,440
Yeah. I should call Imani anyway.

543
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,120
I mean, I'm leaving the Crows.

544
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,200
I didn't listen when my sister
warned me about them.

545
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,080
I didn't listen when you two
warned me about them

546
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,200
and what kills me
is I didn't even listen

547
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,040
when my own gut warned me
about them.

548
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,720
Hate, ignorance, apathy...

549
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's bigger than me.

550
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
They don't deserve you.

551
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,280
Besides,
we need you with the good guys.

552
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
To different minds...

553
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
But the same heart.

554
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,880
Come on. Come on. No!

555
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,080
What did you do?

556
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,440
The thing I knew you couldn't.

557
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,760
So you picked now to get your revenge
on her for screwing with our heads?

558
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,240
This has nothing to do with that.

559
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,800
Then why kill the only person
who can help me get Kate back?

560
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,960
Because I don't want you
to get Kate back.

561
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,680
I don't expect you to get it.

562
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,640
Oh, I get it.

563
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,640
You're jealous because you think
if I get Kate back I won't want you.

564
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,640
I love you.

565
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
What?

566
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
You said it yourself.

567
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,160
You sat in a cell for 11 years

568
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,760
Waiting for your sister to find you,
did she?

569
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,960
Am I the only one who finds it ironic

570
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,960
that freedom is Kate's
emotional touchstone?

571
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,440
How nice must that be.

572
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,680
Tell me something, Alice.

573
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,320
After you escaped
and you finally came face to face

574
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,720
11 years later,
did she even recognize you?

575
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,120
Did Kate recognize you
the way you recognized her

576
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,480
Through the burns, the new voice

577
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,040
the different personality?

578
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
No.

579
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
No.

580
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,320
And Kate tried,
but you were too hard to fix, Alice

581
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,200
and when she had to choose
between her city and you

582
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,680
what did she choose?

583
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,320
You've made your point.

584
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,400
She chose a bunch of strangers
over her own twin.

585
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,800
She locked you in another cell.

586
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,120
She gave up on you.

587
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,600
That's not love, Alice.

588
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,720
That's apathy.

589
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Kate is toxic

590
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,480
and you're better off thinking
she's dead.

591
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,720
The way you marched
into that station was epic.

592
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,960
Everyone was shook.

593
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,200
So, why are you treating me
to these watered-down drinks?

594
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,200
Oh, my bad.

595
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,600
Here. I know the owner.

596
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,480
My mama would have liked you.

597
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,200
I would have liked her, too.

598
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,760
After all, I'm sure
you got all of that from her.

599
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
All of what?

600
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:13,120
Grit, integrity, honesty.

601
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,360
Not entirely honest.

602
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Not with you.

603
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Truth is...

604
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,720
I haven't been sharing all of me
with you.

605
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,920
Yeah. I can take a hint.

606
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,840
I was actually surprised
when I saw your name pop up

607
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
on my phone.

608
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,160
So, what are you, CIA or something?

609
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
It's complicated.

610
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,040
Needless to say,
I've been giving you.

611
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,960
The watered-down version of me, too.

612
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
You deserve way better,

613
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,480
and I am sorry
I can't give that to you right now.

614
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,680
Well, for the record,
I'd rather you be CIA

615
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,720
than dating around 15 other ladies.

616
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
Neither are correct

617
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,600
but feel free to keep guessing.

618
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
- Hello.
- Hey.

619
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,400
Just checking in to see
if you needed an extra hand.

620
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,800
Hilarious. Where are you?
I need a drink

621
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,160
and Ryan's out
breaking Imani's heart.

622
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,600
I'm headed to my Uber.
Do you want to meet up somewhere

623
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,640
- No way.
- What?

624
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,840
- He really is a car thief.
- Who?

625
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,520
Oh. Eli I think is name was.
We met in the holding cell,

626
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,680
and he is full on jacking a car
right now.

627
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,880
Get out of there and call 911.

628
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,960
Nah. I got this. I'll call you back.

629
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Yo, Eli.

630
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
How do you know my name?

631
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Dude from jail.

632
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,240
"Power to the people."

633
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Right.

634
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,760
Get lost. Don't need heat.

635
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,320
Look. I'm not letting you do this.

636
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,080
Hey, hey, hey.

637
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,280
Hey, hey. Eli, knock it off.

638
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,440
Hey, Eli. Stop.

639
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,800
Do yourself a favor.

640
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,040
Don't make me your problem.

641
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,640
What the hell's going on?

642
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,320
- Okay. Look...
- Sir, this man

643
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,560
is trying to steal a car.

644
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,400
- And now he's attacking me.
- Whoa, whoa. No.

645
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Okay. This guy is a known car thief.

646
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,640
His name is E... Eli something,

647
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,120
And I'm trying to stop him.
You know what?

648
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,760
- I have photographic evidence.
- Gun!
