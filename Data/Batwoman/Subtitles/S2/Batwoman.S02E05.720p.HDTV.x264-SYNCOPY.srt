1
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:30,310
It's all there.

2
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:33,557
Tell me where I can find
the Jack Napier painting.

3
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:35,761
Your painting is being
held by The Collective,

4
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,496
private club of connoisseurs

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,631
of outlawed artwork and antiquities.

6
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:42,026
You want to tie the room together

7
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,432
with a vintage canvas that takes you

8
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:47,473
inside the mind of
psychotic criminality?

9
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:49,144
These are the people you need to know.

10
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:50,382
I want an introduction.

11
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:51,987
Oh. The top Crow?

12
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,346
Your biggest clients
are in The Collective.

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,647
They pay your bills.

14
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,497
You walk up to their doorstep

15
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,868
trying to grab that Napier,

16
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:01,273
they're gonna ask you for a refund. Unh!

17
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:18,042
You're from Coryana.

18
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:21,182
You're gonna tell Safiyah
to give my daughter back.

19
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:22,486
Unh!

20
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:27,322
Aah!

21
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:36,121
I got a report of a guy
lurking around East End

22
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,422
with a spiky pole.

23
00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:39,394
It doesn't concern you, Batwoman.

24
00:01:39,398 --> 00:01:41,660
That so? Because he's
hanging off my line,

25
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:44,292
so why don't you tell me
what kind of fish I caught?

26
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:46,798
There's an item I'm looking for.

27
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:49,167
It's gonna help me find my daughter.

28
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,104
The woman holding her captive
doesn't want me to find it.

29
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:54,776
Safiyah? She sent this guy?

30
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,643
Weapon fits the M.O. of her assassins,

31
00:01:57,647 --> 00:02:00,812
but I'll confirm after
you hand him over now.

32
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:03,015
I don't take orders from Crows,

33
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:06,788
and I got a better shot at finding
Kate Kane before you do.

34
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:12,000
"All Crows are bastards".

36
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:25,459
Morning, Gotham.

37
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:27,744
Guess the early bird gives us the bird.

38
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,683
Acrobatic art prankster
Wolf Spider was at it again,

39
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:32,754
rolling his eyes at the entire city

40
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:35,393
from the top of the Gotham
Century skyscraper

41
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:36,865
with an iridescent emoji,

42
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:39,206
millennial hacktivism at its finest

43
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,846
and almost enough to distract us
from an even juicier Bat story.

44
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,440
Another sighting of Batwoman 2.0

45
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:47,979
and top Crow Jacob Kane together,

46
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,334
this time working in the
East End crime scene.

47
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,573
Are we looking at Gotham's
newest power couple?

48
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:55,270
No. Jeez.

49
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:56,975
I thought Batwoman was cool.

50
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:59,909
Hey. We don't know what they were doing.

51
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,545
Maybe Batwoman was saving his ass.

52
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,715
Thought you might be hungry

53
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,321
after last night's reconnecting.

54
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:08,117
Still sleepy.

55
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,086
I wish you could do
something about that.

56
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,950
You can take the day off.

57
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:16,090
Mmm. I can't.

58
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:21,163
As cute as I look in
your ridiculous robe,

59
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,766
I should get home and change first.

60
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,737
You walk of shaming for me?

61
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:27,941
Like the old days.

62
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:32,401
Speaking of the old days,

63
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:36,292
it's time you got that
apology I owe you.

64
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,453
My partying was out of control,

65
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,919
and you took my stash
thinking it would help me,

66
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:47,756
and instead, it got
your ass thrown in jail,

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,859
and I get why you didn't
want me to visit you.

68
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,795
You served 18 months for me, Ry,

69
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,000
and it's time I start paying you back.

70
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,591
One for you, one for me?

71
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:06,983
I love it,

72
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:08,732
but we're good.

73
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:10,270
You got your life together.

74
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:11,908
That's all I wanted.

75
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,575
Ohh! Hey. What is this?

76
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,313
It's... a work injury.

77
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:20,862
You fall on a corkscrew?

78
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:22,600
Ryan, you need to get that looked at.

79
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:24,004
Yeah. I just got this job.

80
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:26,996
I don't need my boss
thinking I can't hack it.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,032
You tend bar. She'll understand.

82
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,851
All these years later
still worrying about me.

83
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,623
It's kind of cute.

84
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:36,361
- You know what's kind of cute?
- Hmm?

85
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:38,366
You...

86
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,590
without that nastiness on your shoulder.

87
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:44,828
You take care of everyone else.

88
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:47,533
Take care of yourself for once.

89
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,724
Giving you an antibiotic.

90
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:55,229
So... it's just an infection?

91
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:57,067
Well, it might have turned necrotic

92
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,271
if you had waited any longer.

93
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:04,098
Are you sure you're not
having any other symptoms

94
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:05,836
that you're not telling me about?

95
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,531
No. I...

96
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:09,970
Maybe a little more tired than normal.

97
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,614
Okay. Okay.

98
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,783
Kate would pop two of these,

99
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:19,286
and she'd be back in fighting shape.

100
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,724
- Okay. Cool.
- But if you're hurt,

101
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:23,362
you should sit out a few days.

102
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,833
Right. Did Kate ever sit out?

103
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:26,737
Kate was never shot with anything

104
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,305
that pierced through the Batsuit,

105
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:32,344
and you shouldn't
compare yourself to her.

106
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:35,751
What's my choice, huh?
Everybody else is.

107
00:05:35,755 --> 00:05:37,523
I know you don't have a Twitter,

108
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:40,729
so I assume you mean Luke.

109
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,636
Just don't tell him about this, okay?

110
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,141
I don't need another reason
for him not to trust me.

111
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,180
He's been questioning
every decision I make.

112
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:49,785
Not to backseat drive, but aren't you

113
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,890
proficient in 6 different
forms of martial arts?

114
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,534
What's the point of
just leaving him here?

115
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:55,851
I told him we wanted
the location of Coryana.

116
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,721
He'll give it up. Take
it from a foster kid.

117
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,672
It is amazing how well you behave

118
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,056
when you are literally starving.

119
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,625
We don't have time to wait him out.

120
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,030
If Alice finds Ocean
before we find Coryana,

121
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:06,454
Safiyah's gonna give Kate to her,

122
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,401
- and Alice is going to kill her.
- Okay. So do your hacker thing

123
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:11,405
and get some info on the spiky pole guy

124
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:12,909
to speed this up.

125
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,608
I already tried.

126
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:18,292
I tracked his movements and confirmed

127
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,630
that he wasn't after Jacob Kane.

128
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:21,300
He was stalking the guy
that he killed in the alley,

129
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:23,337
but the victim was an investment analyst

130
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,975
at Gotham Capital with no record.

131
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,483
What's he got to do with Coryana?

132
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,287
Sir, I'm not defending her actions,

133
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,891
but my guess is she's
after what we're after...

134
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:33,162
Kate's location.

135
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,324
Let her keep Safiyah's thug.

136
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,360
We got a new lead on the Napier...

137
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,664
Evan Blake, old friend of Kate's

138
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:41,288
and a fixture on the Gotham art scene.

139
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,927
Just flew back from a trip to Berlin.

140
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:45,222
He was caught a couple of years ago

141
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:47,995
with plundered artifact and
forced to pay restitution.

142
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:51,195
In other words, a likely
member of The Collective

143
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,833
who might cooperate.

144
00:06:52,837 --> 00:06:55,937
Commander, you're underselling
our entire origin story.

145
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,935
Katie Kane saved my life.

146
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,873
- Really?
- Gotham Prep.

147
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,617
It's eighth grade, and the winter formal

148
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,489
is a multiverse shattering crisis

149
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:05,293
because I'm "straight".

150
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:06,801
Kate was way out by then,

151
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:08,605
I had this tragic crush,

152
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:10,276
and I asked her to the dance.

153
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,741
I'm sure she wanted to
roll her eyes so hard,

154
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:14,985
but with the grace of a saint,

155
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:15,989
she said yes.

156
00:07:15,993 --> 00:07:17,791
The only time you'll
ever hear teenage Kate

157
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:19,162
described as a saint.

158
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,966
My parents take me to pick her up,

159
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,637
and Kate is jaw-dropping

160
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:25,141
in this tailored velvet suit,

161
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,246
just radiating queer confidence.

162
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,967
I on the other hand dissolve
into a monsoon of tears.

163
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,571
Kate races me up to her bedroom,

164
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:32,876
and we go through the whole thing.

165
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,070
"I'm gay". "I know".

166
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:36,708
We make it to the dance,

167
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:38,939
and I came out by default

168
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:41,678
because I wore Kate's Alexander McQueen

169
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:43,183
off-the-shoulder mini,

170
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:45,322
which begged a lot of questions,

171
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:48,295
but I wasn't afraid anymore.

172
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:51,021
I was glowing,

173
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:55,055
and then Kate ditched me to
make out with Maggie Watson.

174
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,127
Sounds like our girl.

175
00:07:57,131 --> 00:08:00,600
So you need my help with
Kate's disappearance.

176
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:01,604
I'm here for you.

177
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:04,009
Kate was looking for a piece of artwork,

178
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:05,413
something that may have gotten her

179
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,917
on the wrong side of
someone very dangerous.

180
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,789
Our theory is if we find the item

181
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:11,227
it will lead us to her captor.

182
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:13,506
Well, you've come to the right art snob.

183
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,411
I was senior editor at the
Gotham Museum of Antiquities,

184
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:18,249
I curate my own private collections,

185
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:20,888
I've got my hands in
a bit of everything.

186
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:23,915
Yeah. We know. Agent Moore.

187
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,079
Kate was looking for a canvas
painted by Jack Napier,

188
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,383
alias the Joker.

189
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:29,785
You're aware of it, yes?

190
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:31,809
I know the legend.

191
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:34,113
Psychotic evildoer breaks into home,

192
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:36,587
splashes homeowner's guts
all over some old painting

193
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:38,994
in the foyer and calls it modern art.

194
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:40,796
It's a bit on the nose if you ask me.

195
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,268
Not to mention illegal
to buy, sell, or possess

196
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,639
since it was stolen from
an active crime scene.

197
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:48,011
I'm sorry. Should there be a harsh light

198
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:49,683
shining in my eyes right now?

199
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:53,672
Because the Kate I knew
never gave a crap about art,

200
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,677
and I haven't spoken with her in years.

201
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,949
We have reason to believe
that you're affiliated

202
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,988
with The Collective.

203
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:01,159
Heh.

204
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:02,853
We'll work to get you full immunity

205
00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:04,357
if you help us make contact.

206
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:07,589
Immunity from what, Ms. Moore?

207
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:09,124
I'm a perfect angel.

208
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:10,959
I thought you were here friend.

209
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:14,596
I love Katie, but this
feels like entrapment.

210
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,768
If you need to contact me again,

211
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:18,973
I'll refer you to my lawyers.

212
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,109
I want all our tech inside
every device Evan owns,

213
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:31,112
round-the-clock revolving tails.

214
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:33,084
Yes, sir, but there could be

215
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:35,323
an easier way to locate Coryana...

216
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,228
with Batwoman's help.

217
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:39,766
Let me ask her for
access to her prisoner.

218
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,680
Batwoman or whoever it is

219
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:43,185
who stepped in for my daughter,

220
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:45,624
I am not gonna grovel at her feet.

221
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:46,872
Then let me do it

222
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:48,810
or at least ask nicely

223
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:51,366
because Alice will do
a lot worse than grovel

224
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,371
to find Kate before we do.

225
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:56,717
_

226
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:18,280
Ocean.

227
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:22,907
Hi.

228
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:24,345
Hi.

229
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:35,205
What do you call it when you're sure

230
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,210
you've met someone...

231
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:41,360
You're sure you've never met?

232
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,137
A stay of execution.

Why? Do I look depressed?

240
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:13,151
You've got the sophistication

Heh. Mouse. Ahem. Touchy subject.

242
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:22,062
Don't you think mice are cute?

243
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:27,333
I had a mouse in my life.

244
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:29,597
I loved him like a brother,

245
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,102
and when he started holding me back

246
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:33,908
from my dreams, I killed him.

247
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:35,512
Heh.

248
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:41,543

Can I join you

254
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:02,534
in case he decides to try it again?

255
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,639
Pretty sure he's in the
next county by now,

256
00:12:04,643 --> 00:12:07,211
but by all means.

257
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,791
Last time I came here
to meet a Batwoman,

258
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:33,461
the vibes... were different.

259
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:36,064
Please say this isn't a booty call.

260
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:38,770
Look. I don't know
where you got this idea

261
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:40,341
that all Crows are bastards,

262
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:42,121
but some of us are trying
to make a difference.

263
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:44,764
Well, in my experience,
when the crows fly together,

264
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:46,569
they call it a murder for a reason.

265
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:48,241
I want to offer you a deal.

266
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:50,925
You get everything we know
about Safiyah and Coryana,

267
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:52,930
and we get access to your prisoner.

268
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:54,774
So you can beat him
within an inch of his life.

269
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:57,413
He's a murderer who knows
where Kate's being held.

270
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:58,617
I'll think about it.

271
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:01,423
You should be doing everything
in your power to help Kate.

272
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:04,426
I don't need a Crow telling
me how to do my job.

273
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,632
I'm not speaking to you as a Crow.

274
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:10,171
Kate's the love of my life,

275
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:12,709
and I need your help to get her back.

276
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:23,903
Hell to the no. No.

277
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:26,107
Working with the Crows
makes my skin crawl.

278
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,111
Screw that. No.

279
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:29,654
It's not like we're hosting
them a fundraiser.

280
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:32,659
Trust me. We make a
deal that sounds good,

281
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:33,763
they'll break it.

282
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,533
Not if we're dealing with Sophie.

283
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:37,536
Sophie has hauled my
ass in for questioning

284
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,268
so many times she knows
my damn coffee order. No!

285
00:13:41,272 --> 00:13:44,207
Will you talk some sense
into her, please?

286
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:47,046
We're at a dead end,
Ryan. Look. I'm sorry,

287
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,218
but you're outvoted.

288
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:51,904
I get it. You want Kate back,

289
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:55,478
but the Crows have tried
to ruin my life for fun.

290
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:57,282
I'm not helping them!

291
00:14:15,632 --> 00:14:19,198
Okay. So.

292
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:21,501
Crows horror stories.

293
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:23,403
You want me to go, or...

294
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:25,641
do you want to do yours first?

295
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:29,245
My girl Angelique had a drug habit,

296
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,513
and on a very ugly night,

297
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:38,970
she was gone, like a different person,

298
00:14:38,974 --> 00:14:41,375
so I found her stash, and I took it,

299
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,690
thinking I could somehow
straighten her out,

300
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:46,694
bring her back.

301
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:51,764
I'm on the street, crying,

302
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:53,633
no question what kind
of night I'm having,

303
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:56,035
and I pass these two Crows,

304
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,374
and one of them yells out,

305
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:00,948
"You'd be cuter with
a smile on your face".

306
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,303
And my mama told me what to do about it.

307
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:07,609
I pay them no mind and keep moving,

308
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:10,416
but they... they wouldn't let it go,

309
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,456
so my hand went out, my
finger went up, and boom,

310
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,154
those Crows had what they wanted.

311
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:18,158
They found the drugs and
thought they were yours.

312
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:21,964
Sorry that happened to you.

313
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:24,402
What was yours?

314
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:27,842
Um... the Crows...

315
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:34,477
killed my father.

316
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:36,016
Wait. What?

317
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,148
Really?

318
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:40,820
Really.

319
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:44,887
It's, uh, not a story for today,

320
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:46,891
but, um...

321
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:51,026
It's the worst thing that
ever happened to me.

322
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:05,040
I should have let you go first.

323
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Look. I will never forgive them,

324
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,719
and I don't want to
help the Crows either,

325
00:16:17,354 --> 00:16:20,354
but we need them to help us.

326
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:32,718
Remember, this isn't punishment

327
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:33,922
just for the sake of it.

328
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,694
Given this murderer
every opportunity to talk,

329
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:39,572
so unless you have any other ideas,

330
00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:42,875
it's time to take this
to the next level.

331
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,844
You've got some choices.

332
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:47,917
You can give us the
location of Coryana...

333
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:49,121
Unh!

334
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,169
You can get us in touch with Safiyah

335
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:54,209
or the man known as Ocean.

336
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,249
Help us find the Napier painting.

337
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:00,495
Listen to me.

338
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:02,728
It is not worth what
they're gonna do to you.

339
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:04,133
The Many Arms will kill whoever

340
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:06,199
lays hands on that painting.

341
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:09,071
You'll never find Coryana.

342
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:11,576
I never said the two were related.

343
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:16,845
The painting gets us
to Coryana? Is it a map?

344
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:25,487
Cyanide capsule!

345
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:28,491
- Let's get him down!
- It's too late. It's too late.

346
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,817
Kane pushed him too hard,

347
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,288
and now we're at a dead end.

348
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,232
Maybe not.

349
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:40,696
We've been surveilling a suspect
we linked to the Napier,

350
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,801
and we just got a hit on its location.

351
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:44,472
A group called The Collective

352
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:46,706
is having a special exhibition
tomorrow night

353
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,510
to auction the painting off.

354
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:50,280
Why now?

355
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:52,044
Word must have gotten back to the owner

356
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:53,948
about the body that
dropped the other night.

357
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:55,452
Too much heat.

358
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,883
You doing anything tomorrow night?

359
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,785
You looking for a date to this thing?

360
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:01,578
We don't have an insider,

361
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,183
but we need someone with
no connection to the Crows

362
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:05,754
who can infiltrate the event

363
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:08,262
and grab the Napier
without getting caught.

364
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:12,128
I go alone.

365
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,833
No Crows at the location,

366
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:15,151
no surveillance,

367
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:16,756
and I want you directly in charge

368
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,960
of any Crows assigned to this mission.

369
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:25,111
This is a one-off. We're not partners.

370
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:37,123
So... Ocean... what do you do?

371
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:40,228
I... bore people to death
by telling them

372
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,151
I'm a soil technician.

373
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:45,885
Ooh. That sounds like a fancy name

374
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:48,409
for dirt nerd,

375
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:49,980
but you smiled when you said it,

376
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:52,619
so... you must like your work.

377
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:55,177
I grew up in nature.

378
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:57,641
My family cultivated everything
we ever needed

379
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:59,679
from the land.

380
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:03,683
In a place like Gotham,
where everything is concrete,

381
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:06,890
isn't that incredible?

382
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:09,798
So tell me,

383
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:13,402
where is this magical
place you hail from?

384
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:18,655
♪ And I chase my whiskey
with the blues ♪

385
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,126
I'm meeting an associate.

386
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,431
Should splash some water on my face.

387
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:26,635
5 shots... no regrets.

388
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,678
Hey. Can I ask you something?

389
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:35,648
Have we met somewhere before?

390
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,086
Think I'd remember you.

391
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,852
♪ Chase my whiskey with the blues ♪

392
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:41,856
Probably just thinking
about somebody else.

393
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:49,588
Oh, well.

394
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:17,560
Do you mind...

395
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:19,765
shutting the shade?

396
00:20:24,968 --> 00:20:28,371
You slept through half the day.

397
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:32,178
5 shots, no regrets.

398
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,617
Shall I explain?

399
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,968
I do wish you would.

400
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,972
Some lunatic on a far-away island

401
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:43,326
is holding my sister hostage,

402
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,030
and she won't hand her
over until I gut you

403
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:47,068
and air mail the evidence.

404
00:20:47,072 --> 00:20:49,564
This woman got a name?

405
00:20:49,568 --> 00:20:52,468
Enough women want you
dead I need to be specific?

406
00:20:52,472 --> 00:20:54,604
Just answer the damn question.

407
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:56,372
Safiyah.

408
00:20:56,376 --> 00:21:00,876
Although her obedient island
followers call her queen.

409
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:06,522
Not me.

410
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,728
I called her sister.

411
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:17,661
I have 3 words.

412
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:21,533
Who... is she?

413
00:21:21,537 --> 00:21:24,037
Ohh! Mm-wha! Look!

414
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:26,886
♪ We're making snow melt ♪

415
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,992
Wait. Are you sure art collectors

416
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:32,731
are supposed to have this much swag?

417
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:34,970
Well, first of all,
they're not art collectors.

418
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:38,748
They're outlaws, and if
Evan Blake is the style guide,

419
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:41,183
this party's about to look
like "The Hunger Games".

420
00:21:41,187 --> 00:21:42,987
What's Evan Blake's deal?

421
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,091
Ohh.

422
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:51,298
He and I were always
angling for Kate's affection.

423
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:55,002
Nope. He was way more competitive

424
00:21:55,006 --> 00:22:00,006
and had... heh... a
lot more flair than me.

425
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,090
Now he's overeducated, and apparently,

426
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:06,044
he's addicted to mischief.

427
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:09,384
The Crows say that he runs
the door for The Collective.

428
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:10,956
Oh. No.

429
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,080
- Yeah.
- Okay.

430
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,238
Well, I think I can make this work.

431
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:20,742
I'd say so.

432
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:25,182
H-Hey. I... I brought the plan...

433
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:27,721
I... I brought the game plan.

434
00:22:31,404 --> 00:22:33,121
The event is inside a private hangar

435
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,125
at Gotham International.

436
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:36,429
It's actually a pretty
clever way of doing this.

437
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:39,099
So The Collective flies in,
they unload their pieces,

438
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:40,943
they buy, sell, party,

439
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,210
then they load back up, fly away.

440
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:46,043
No customs, no TSA, maximum security.

441
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:48,547
How are we sneaking the
Batsuit through that security?

442
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,465
See, we just happen to have VIP access

443
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,704
to every square inch of that terminal.

444
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:56,408
Yeah. Between Wayne Enterprises
and Hamilton Dynamics,

445
00:22:56,412 --> 00:22:59,080
we burn more private jet fuel

446
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:02,334
than the Hadids, Kardashians,
and the Air Force combined.

447
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:04,200
Yeah. So with our resources,

448
00:23:04,204 --> 00:23:06,364
Crows' intelligence, and a secret agent

449
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:10,005
that no one's going to
suspect... Ryan Wilder.

450
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:13,079
Wait. I'm just supposed
to talk my way inside?

451
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,084
Oh, no.

452
00:23:15,088 --> 00:23:17,613
Did you think Mary had
all the accessories?

453
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,411
Look at this precision metalwork.

454
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:27,690
The weight is perfectly balanced.

455
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:29,725
What's the provenance?

456
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:31,394
Which Bat did it belong to?

457
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:33,065
Woman.

458
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:35,504
- 1.0 or...
- Current model.

459
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:40,836
The batarang is a stunning piece.

460
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,674
We'll make an exception

461
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:45,078
and allow it into the exhibition.

462
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:49,905
Okay. I'm really loving that dress.

463
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,409
Didn't it debut in London?

464
00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:52,673
- Nailed it.
- Huh.

465
00:23:52,677 --> 00:23:56,227
Actually, it was New York, winter '18.

466
00:23:56,231 --> 00:23:57,831
Well, I heard there was a dress code,

467
00:23:57,835 --> 00:24:00,319
so I borrowed it from a friend.

468
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:02,224
Heard from who exactly?

469
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:04,368
Of course, I'm a big believer
in the first amendment

470
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,458
except when it comes to
the shenanigans that go on

471
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:08,364
behind The Collective's closed doors.

472
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,528
Ha ha! Evan baby,

473
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,062
what are you doing to my girl here?

474
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:15,500
You beat me here.

475
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:18,904
Ang, big night. Patrons
need their party favors.

476
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,911
Ahh.

477
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:23,675
And this one's yours?

478
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,081
Yeah. I totally spaced on the heads up.

479
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:29,752
It's fine. You're forgiven.

480
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:30,986
Any questions?

481
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,725
Pronouns?

482
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:35,697
He/him, they/them.

483
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:37,835
I go with the flow.

484
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,239
Now, you two, go forth and do crimes.

485
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,500
Ang, what are you doing here?

486
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:46,836
Saving your ass at the door.

487
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,740
You can't just slide into the DMs.

488
00:24:48,744 --> 00:24:49,944
You need a referral.

489
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,848
What party favors was he talking about?

490
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,310
Ang, no.

491
00:24:55,314 --> 00:24:56,614
What do you want me to say?

492
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:58,218
That you weren't lying
through your teeth

493
00:24:58,222 --> 00:24:59,823
when you told me you'd
pulled your life together.

494
00:24:59,826 --> 00:25:02,126
For your information, I'm clean.

495
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,690
4 months, but do you
know what people need

496
00:25:04,694 --> 00:25:07,857
to pull their lives together? Money.

497
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:11,691
If you get caught, distribution
is 8-10 at Blackgate.

498
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:15,131
Says the girl turning Batwoman's
missing hardware

499
00:25:15,135 --> 00:25:17,399
into an Etsy shop.

500
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:19,104
We know what I'm doing here.

501
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:21,108
What are you doing here?

502
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:25,274
Save it.

503
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,680
You are the only one here who's judging.

504
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:34,917
- Is this thing on?
- Loud and clear.

505
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:36,588
Want to try channel two?

506
00:25:36,592 --> 00:25:38,526
No, not really.

507
00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:41,894
Batwoman to Moore.

508
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:44,099
Copy. You're late.

509
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:45,904
Thought maybe you got cold feet.

510
00:25:45,908 --> 00:25:49,431
Believe it or not, I ran into an ex.

511
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:53,335
Oh. Okay. Well, I hope
he's not gonna be drama.

512
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:56,105
She, and always.

513
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,659
Let you know when I find the painting.

514
00:25:57,663 --> 00:25:59,264
Stand by.

515
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,654
Luke... got the target.

516
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:10,492
Okay. Great.

517
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:12,397
Give me a good look.

518
00:26:23,102 --> 00:26:25,704
Okay. Moving on to the next phase.

519
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:59,201
A lot of interest in this one.

520
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:02,965
Yeah. It's kind of gimmicky, isn't it?

521
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,769
Oh, it's dreadful, zero technique,

522
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:07,773
but, you know, celebrity artists.

523
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,778
Hmm. Help me to understand the appeal

524
00:27:09,782 --> 00:27:12,642
in owning something like this.

525
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:14,881
Some of the people here... total sickos.

526
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:16,915
- And you?
- I don't like being told

527
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:18,854
what I can and can't do in life.

528
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:20,558
Whether it's the art I collect

529
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:21,995
or the clothes I wear,

530
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:24,260
I'm not desperate for anyone's approval.

531
00:27:24,264 --> 00:27:26,494
Still throwing shade
at my borrowed couture.

532
00:27:26,498 --> 00:27:29,500
Heh. What can I say?

533
00:27:29,504 --> 00:27:32,664
I just prefer to see
everyone's true colors.

534
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,473
So I ran a spectral analysis

535
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,177
to isolate the original canvas

536
00:27:43,181 --> 00:27:44,848
underneath the Gore.

537
00:27:44,852 --> 00:27:46,820
I think it's a painting
of ocean currents.

538
00:27:46,824 --> 00:27:49,514
- You were right.
- The Joker splattered some poor guy

539
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:51,482
all over a map to Coryana?

540
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:54,187
But we'll need to restore the canvas

541
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:55,424
to locate the island.

542
00:27:55,428 --> 00:27:56,488
But that means...

543
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:58,226
You're gonna need to steal it.

544
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:09,638
I didn't know Safiyah had family.

545
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:11,109
We weren't blood.

546
00:28:11,113 --> 00:28:14,148
Apparently, we weren't anything.

547
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:17,086
Why does she want me dead?

548
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,190
Oh, no offense,

549
00:28:18,194 --> 00:28:20,634
but I have way too much
drama in my life to care.

550
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:24,621
She's obviously losing
her touch if she sent you.

551
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,855
I'm sorry. Did you just
call me a bad assassin?

552
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:28,359
Not to Monday morning quarterback,

553
00:28:28,363 --> 00:28:31,023
but you had ample
opportunity to kill me.

554
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:32,327
You knew I was staying here,

555
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:34,691
which means you could
have killed me in my sleep,

556
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:37,230
but maybe you don't
know how to pick a lock.

557
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,354
Fine. Surprise attack
in the bar bathroom...

558
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:42,237
easy, private.

559
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:45,607
At the very least, you can
ambush me in my truck.

560
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:48,177
I have a backseat, and
I don't lock my doors,

561
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:52,981
but instead, you, what,
make a scene at the bar,

562
00:28:52,985 --> 00:28:54,645
get my attention,

563
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,753
indulge in smalltalk, get drunk.

564
00:28:57,757 --> 00:29:03,027
Heh. Safiyah must be
desperate if she sent you.

565
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:08,397
I needed more answers
before I could kill you.

566
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:10,135
I've never seen you before in my life.

567
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:13,041
Nor I you, which is why
I needed to know more

568
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:15,645
before I made Ocean bleed the red sea.

569
00:29:19,877 --> 00:29:22,579
How do you even know
what Coryana looks like?

570
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,952
Because I was there 5 years ago.

571
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:27,423
That's impossible.

572
00:29:27,427 --> 00:29:29,529
I was there 5 years ago.

573
00:29:31,484 --> 00:29:33,652
- How peculiar.
- Hmm.

574
00:29:35,294 --> 00:29:38,394
Well, I suppose you could kill me

575
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:40,213
and then spend the rest
of your life on the run,

576
00:29:40,216 --> 00:29:42,067
seeing as none of this changes the fact

577
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,206
the island queen still wants you dead,

578
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,278
or we could give her a jingle.

579
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:49,442
I'm good with option "A".

580
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:54,055
Safiyah, we both know this
isn't about a stupid flower.

581
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,889
And what do you think it's about?

582
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:57,753
Me having the one thing you can't.

583
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:04,861
What the hell was that?

584
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:06,232
Exactly.

585
00:30:06,236 --> 00:30:08,538
Option "B" it is.

586
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,542
Ahem.

587
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,267
There should be a dispenser
next to the sink

588
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:20,471
with... uh, you know, products.

589
00:30:20,475 --> 00:30:21,719
I see it.

590
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:23,003
A lot of firepower in that room,

591
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:24,208
so you're gonna have to move fast.

592
00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:26,611
Batwoman, status check. You find it?

593
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:30,411
Target identified. I
just need to take it

594
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:32,903
for further analysis.

595
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:34,407
We'll monitor from here.

596
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:51,689
Uh... Batwoman?

597
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,927
I think we have competition.

598
00:31:02,931 --> 00:31:04,098
Who?

599
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:05,636
You ever heard of Wolf Spider?

600
00:31:08,304 --> 00:31:10,336
Shoot him before he gets too high!

601
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,070
Miss... Miss, this way, please.

602
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:13,609
No. Ryan!

603
00:31:16,753 --> 00:31:18,454
Hand it over.

604
00:31:35,322 --> 00:31:37,123
- Hyah!
- Unh!

605
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:39,844
Ugh!

606
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,540
Damn.

607
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,787
Unh!

608
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,754
Ugh! Ohh.

609
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:05,524
Painting's on the move.

610
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:07,029
Do you need medical?

611
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:09,234
Ugh. Just slow him down. I'll be there.

612
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:10,738
We're on it.

613
00:32:32,188 --> 00:32:33,688
Nimble little bastard.

614
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:35,692
Little taser action will slow him down.

615
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:46,098
Damn it! Get me closer.

616
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:47,702
I'm on it.

617
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:55,341
Aw. Fricking cartridge is jammed!

618
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,514
Dude, what did you do?

619
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:04,553
He jumped in front of me.

620
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:12,061
Get some ties on him.

621
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:16,562
This isn't good. Call for medical.

622
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:19,274
Status check.

623
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:21,908
Target acquired. We got the painting.

624
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:23,942
- Let's go.
- What? What are you doing?

625
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:26,074
We can't leave him here.

626
00:33:26,078 --> 00:33:27,938
Moore wants the painting,

627
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:30,142
not an excessive force headline.

628
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:32,274
Let's go.

629
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:33,912
Someone else will clean him up.

630
00:34:03,613 --> 00:34:04,813
Evan?

631
00:34:04,817 --> 00:34:08,017
Evan! Evan, can you hear me?

632
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:16,038
We're gonna need
a blood drive after this.

633
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:17,320
He's gonna recover, right?

634
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:20,534
Well, considering he was hip
checked by a 4,800-pound hunk

635
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:22,305
of toxic masculinity,

636
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:24,905
he's doing great.

637
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:27,283
Distal femur fracture, dislocated elbow,

638
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:29,021
minor concussion,

639
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,225
but when the bone shattered,

640
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:32,729
it nicked his femoral artery,

641
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,863
so if you hadn't been there
to bring him in in time,

642
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,583
he would have bled out.

643
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:38,552
Okay. What... what happened back there?

644
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:40,787
You want to know what happened?

645
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:43,721
I listened to you over
my gut, and now look.

646
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:45,225
I meant what happened to you?

647
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:46,530
You sounded like you
were in rough shape.

648
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:47,633
You called for backup.

649
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:49,323
This isn't about me.

650
00:34:49,327 --> 00:34:50,927
This is about us,

651
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:53,431
this team and how I can't keep working

652
00:34:53,435 --> 00:34:54,868
for your approval.

653
00:34:54,872 --> 00:34:56,363
I wanted to suit up

654
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:59,236
and not think about you comparing
me to Kate Kane for once,

655
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,540
so I agreed to partner with the Crows,

656
00:35:01,544 --> 00:35:03,176
and for what?

657
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,246
You sided with the guys
who killed your old man.

658
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,282
Your taste sucks,

659
00:35:09,286 --> 00:35:11,657
but you know what?

660
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:14,296
I wear the suit, I take the bullets,

661
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,035
so when I say I have a bad
feeling about something,

662
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,940
you two, listen!

663
00:35:24,716 --> 00:35:28,419
Did her majesty say when
she'd grace us with a callback?

664
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:30,658
Would you just sit there

665
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:32,718
without talking?

666
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:34,352
I have spent more years of my life

667
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:38,159
in captivity than any elephant
in the Gotham zoo.

668
00:35:38,163 --> 00:35:42,733
The key to surviving...
keep yourself entertained.

669
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:43,838
Rough childhood?

670
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:47,042
You could say I come by my
abandonment issues honestly, yeah.

671
00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:49,546
How do you know Safiyah?

672
00:35:50,803 --> 00:35:54,603
I was squatting on a yacht
in Gotham Harbor.

673
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:57,309
Safiyah's minions were pirating
it while I was on board,

674
00:35:57,313 --> 00:36:00,816
and apparently, she was impressed

675
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,154
by the fight I put up.

676
00:36:02,158 --> 00:36:03,692
And she let you stay?

677
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:05,630
- Yeah.
- No way.

678
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:08,470
The island's cardinal
rule is no outsiders.

679
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:09,709
Hmm.

680
00:36:11,326 --> 00:36:12,960
Why don't I remember any of this?

681
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:14,953
That's the thing.

682
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:17,692
You should, and I should remember you.

683
00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:19,871
The fact that we both
have the same memories

684
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:22,135
makes me think that
Safiyah did something

685
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,573
to get us to forget.

686
00:36:24,577 --> 00:36:27,012
You think Safiyah erased our memory?

687
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:29,642
Some of them.

688
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,050
The thing is we might never know.

689
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:37,097
Tell me you ordered delivery

690
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:41,401
and those aren't 1, 2...
3 assassins approaching.

691
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,326
Hmm.

692
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,252
The Many Arms of Death.

693
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:50,156
Oh. More relatives of yours, I presume.

694
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,195
Yeah. Can you, uh, cut me loose?

695
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,000
I can't trust you.

696
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,374
You don't trust me to defend
myself from murder?

697
00:37:15,806 --> 00:37:17,006
Where's Ocean?

698
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,210
Hey.

699
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:19,614
Surprise.

700
00:37:21,436 --> 00:37:22,569
Aah!

701
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,435
Hey. Do you have any cash?

702
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:32,340
We should probably leave the maid a tip.

703
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:33,344
You're dark.

704
00:37:33,348 --> 00:37:34,782
Shouldn't have doubted me.

705
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,487
Let's go. You're driving.

706
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,236
Badges of the Crows who did this.

707
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,132
That's not enough,

708
00:37:46,136 --> 00:37:48,902
burn it all down, girl, the whole thing.

709
00:37:48,906 --> 00:37:50,737
I can't do that.

710
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:52,579
I believe in the mission of the Crows.

711
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,934
An organization that
decides what justice is

712
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:57,023
based on who can pay the most money,

713
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:59,362
that beats information
out of its suspects,

714
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:01,701
that runs someone over
for stealing a painting?

715
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:03,105
That's what you believe in?

716
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:05,989
You think two men losing
their jobs isn't enough?

717
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:09,596
You're right, but I'm fighting
to change the culture.

718
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,641
Yeah? Well, good luck with that,

719
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:13,045
but if you want to party with me,

720
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:15,569
add your badge to that
little pile over there.

721
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:19,173
Until then, this partnership is over.

722
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:21,378
What about the painting?

723
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,582
Our forensics team is
still working on it.

724
00:38:23,586 --> 00:38:25,646
Don't you want to know where Coryana is?

725
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,650
We'll see who gets there first.

726
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:50,223
Mary Hamilton. Heh heh. Awkward.

727
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,027
Because I know you're Wolf Spider?

728
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:53,831
Because I'm pretty sure I'm naked.

729
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:55,835
Oh, very much so.

730
00:38:57,415 --> 00:39:00,250
Evan, you need to find a better suit.

731
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,489
Spandex is no match for an oncoming SUV.

732
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:05,853
Mmm. But it's so comfortable.

733
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:09,890
Then maybe find a safer
excuse to play dress-up.

734
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:13,250
Gotham's elite take
themselves too seriously.

735
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:14,988
Who else is gonna eye-roll them

736
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:17,492
with as much style as me?

737
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:21,971
The Crows got the painting.

738
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:26,532
I was stealing it for Kate.

739
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,580
Thought I had a better
chance at grabbing it

740
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:32,084
than the Crows.

741
00:39:32,088 --> 00:39:33,889
Hey. Don't beat yourself up about it

742
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:36,729
because it turns out nobody
actually got the Napier painting.

743
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:38,167
It was a forgery.

744
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:39,705
- That's impossible.
- No.

745
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:42,110
Batwoman took a sample
of the organic compound

746
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:44,215
that was painted over
the original canvas,

747
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,219
and it was pig's blood.

748
00:39:48,117 --> 00:39:50,151
Napier would've never used pig's blood.

749
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:53,155
Right. So the Crows ended up

750
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,294
with a decoy copy, and the original

751
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:57,498
is still out there somewhere,

752
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,276
and so is Kate.

753
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:41,396
Oh, my God.

754
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:51,442
Once we get some distance
from the Many Arms,

755
00:40:51,446 --> 00:40:53,680
we can try to figure out
what Safiyah did to us

756
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,218
and why.

757
00:40:55,222 --> 00:40:58,446
Looks like you're not as fast
as you think, buddy boy.

758
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,518
They got you pretty bad back there.

759
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:10,718
Hey. You all right?

760
00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:14,024
Uh... yeah. Eyes on the road.

761
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:17,902
What's with you?

762
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:19,406
Nothing.

763
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,370
Can you check in the back real quick?

764
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:24,709
Is there a white tube back there?

765
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:26,313
Yeah.

766
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:31,217
What is this?

767
00:41:32,854 --> 00:41:35,089
You ever hear of a guy
called Jack Napier?

768
00:42:04,068 --> 00:42:06,203
Greg, move your head!
