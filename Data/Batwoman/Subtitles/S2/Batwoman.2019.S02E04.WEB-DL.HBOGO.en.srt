00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,760
<i>As if there were
a shortage of syringes</i>

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,520
<i>in Gotham's gutters,
a new party drug just hit the streets</i>

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,200

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,880
<i>It seems the gang known
as the False Face Society</i>

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,760
<i>is showing
their entrepreneurial side</i>

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,480
<i>by making
and distributing snakebite,</i>

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,200
<i>known for its dual-pronged
injector needles,</i>

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,000
<i>which are said to give
a double whammy dose</i>

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,160
<i>of fantasy and fright,</i>

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,800
<i>so more fang for your buck.</i>

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,240
<i>This trippy two-for-one
is part psychedelic mushroom oil,</i>

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,560
<i>part concentrated fear toxin.</i>

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,560
<i>It's already sunk its teeth
into the city,</i>

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,320
<i>becoming the most sought-after high
on the street.</i>

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,720
<i>Users are calling it
the ultimate escapism,</i>

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,440
<i>but doctors warn that snakebite
is as lethal as it is addictive.</i>

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,320
<i>Talk to me, Gotham.
Am I the only one</i>

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,960
<i>who's feeling rattled?</i>

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,040
Are you...

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,400
Are you real?

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,480
You're throwing your life away.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,280
That crap will kill you.

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,680
Certainly get you close.

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,800
That's the point.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,360
Fear, fantasy,
whatever makes your blood pump.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,800
Who sold you this stuff?

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
Sorry. Can't give a plug.

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,080
I will ask you this
just one more time.

30
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,680
Who is your dealer?

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Target acquired.

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
<i>You're not actually gonna run him
over, right?</i>

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,240
And ruin my new paint job?

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,000
What the...?

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,320
You're not Batwoman!

36
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,640
What was that?

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
I don't know.

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,880
Steering got a little stiff.

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,160
You get off on ruining lives?

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,080
I don't tell my clients
what to do.

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,720
Well, I'm gonna tell
you what to do.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,720
Stop destroying lives.
who's your boss?

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,920
You tell him I will find
the head of the snake,

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
and I will cut it off.

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,120
I couldn't get the bat-light,
so I yanked the door.

46
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,480
You set this off?

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,920
My brother left for school,
and he never showed up.

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,280
He's been gone for three months,
and nobody cares.

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,720
Do you care, Batwoman?

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,880
{\an5}I have received intelligence

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,200
{\an5}suggesting that my daughter
Kate Kane is alive.

52
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,800
{\an5}I believe that she survived the crash

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,760
{\an5}or perhaps wasn't even
on the aircraft to begin with.

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,000
{\an5}I also believe that my daughter
is collateral damage

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,560
{\an5}between two warring parties

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,640
{\an5}and I am personally offering
a million-dollar cash reward

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,640
to anyone who can provide
information into who took her

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,480
{\an5}or how that happened.

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,480
{\an5}What do you tell critics who think
this is a futile attempt to rectify

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,520
{\an5}your failed search for Beth Kane?

61
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,120
Well, I... I tell them
that I am a father

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,440
who needs your help
to find his daughter

63
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,960
{\an5}and this search will not fail.
Thank you.

64
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,880
<i>With the largest cash reward

65

{\an5}All this press combined
with a one million dollar reward?

70
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,680
{\an5}We're gonna find Kate.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
- What?
- Nothing.

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,280
{\an5}Sophie just told us
that Kate is alive on an island

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,600
in the Mediterranean.

74
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,960
{\an5}Yeah, and the person who told Sophie
that Kate's alive is named Alice

75
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,600
{\an5}and Alice heard it
from some mystery woman

76
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
{\an5}named Safiyah

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,360
{\an5}who just hired a hitman
to try and kill me

78
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,680
{\an5}so we are playing a game of telephone
with a bunch of homicidal women.

79
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,080
Or Alice is telling the truth,

80
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,640
and Kate needs us to find her.

81
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
Or she's not, and we're getting
our hopes up for nothing.

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,360
{\an5}See, Alice can't get my hopes up

83
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,800
{\an5}because I never lost hope
to begin with.

84
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
Where are you going?

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,440
To work with someone

86
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,400
who wants to find Kate
as badly as I do.

87
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,920
<i>Local firemen rushed
to the scene of a...</i>

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,480
Hey. Team meeting. Where's Luke?

89
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Burrowing down a rabbit hole.

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,760
Well, clearly, you're free today.

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,000
We've got ourselves a bat mission.

92
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,760
Black, male, foster kid, juvie.

93
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,240
{\an5}In case you're wondering
why GCPD isn't looking for him,

94
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,760
{\an5}those five words.

95
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,160
{\an5}They probably just wrote him off
as a runaway.

96
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,520
How long has he been missing?

97
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Couple of months.

98
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,920
Oh, wait. I once lived
in the neighborhood he's from

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,240
{\an5}Wayside heights, aka wasteside.

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,800
Is that where you lived with Corah?

101
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,800
{\an5}No. Wasteside was years
before Mama found me.

102
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,480
{\an5}This was one of the group homes,

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,680
{\an5}but there was nothing homey about it.

104
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Check it. New girl.

105
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,760
{\an5}Hi. I'm Ryan. I'm 12.

106
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,640
{\an5}My favorite animal's
the snow leopard.

107
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
{\an5}My favorite color's yellow.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,520
{\an5}My last foster parents
said I watch too much tv.

109
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,840
Did your last foster mama

110
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,000
tell you that you
talk too damn much?

111
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,680
Yo. Open up.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,240
I know you hear me.

113
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Thanks.

114
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,400
Gonna get your ass busted.

115
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,000
Gonna be boring your whole life.

116
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
{\an5}Am I on your bed or something?

117
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
{\an5}No. I'm just nosy.

118
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,120
"Ghost kid"? he ain't a superhero.

119
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Says who?

120
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,880
All he can do is be invisible.

121
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,000
Maybe people
who feel invisible think he's dope.

122
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,760
Who? Like you?

123
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,720
For the record, I see you.

124
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
New rule.

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,040
You keep opening that window for me,

126
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,760
and I've got your back
when you need someone.

127
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,080
So, do you remember the area?

128
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Ryan?

129
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,680
The police report says he disappeared
between home and school.

130
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,680
Well, worth checking out his route.
Field trip? I'll drive.

131
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
The Batmobile?

132
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,760
I actually love vintage vans.

133
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,720
Well, uh, my carburetor chokes,

134
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,280
fuel leaks,
and I don't have any air bags,

135
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,040
but, yeah,
if you want to take a selfie

136
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,120
in my living room for Insta,
be my guest.

137
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,360
Wait. You, like, live here live here.

138
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,480
Like, full-time?

139
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,160
Who else would keep my plant company?

140
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,800
Wait. Hold up.

141
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,120
What are we doing here?

142
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,280
Give me a sec.

143
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,080
Crap.

144
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,560
Garbage.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

146
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,640
What you doing, sweetie?

147
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,160
I'm not stealing. These are free.

148
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,320
Oh, don't worry. I'm not police.

149
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,120
Around here, I'm known
as the neighborhood Candy Lady.

150
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Jelly bean?

151
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
No.

152
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,120
So, my son...

153
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,520
Just left for boarding school

154
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,560
and now, I got a minivan
full of comic books.

155
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,720
I was just about to donate them

156
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,120
but, maybe you might want
to pick through them first.

157
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Depends. What's he all got?

158
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,200
Too many,
and by the looks of your stash

159
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,560
I'm guessing your mom
has the same problem I do?

160
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm good. Thanks.

161
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
No worries, sweetie. Just an offer.

162
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,680
Well, I'll just get these inside.
Happy hunting.

163
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Wait.

164
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,520
Maybe I'll take a peek.

165
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Why are we here?

166
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,240
Because I think Kevin was grabbed
from here to be brainwashed

167
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,720
and sold to a gang.

168
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,840
And you got all that from a janky
comic book storefront?

169
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,360
I got all that
because the same damn thing

170
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
happened to me.

171
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,840
Oh. Let me guess.

172
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,520
You're not a morning person.

173
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,720
What the hell are you doing
in my condo?

174
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,920
Sampling the products
in your guest bath.

175
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,720
Of course, your theme is lavender.

176
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Alice.

177
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,960
Fine. Allow me to remind you
what happened less than 48 hours ago

178
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,760
when I explained to you I made
a deal with Safiyah for Kate.

179
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,240
She gives me Kate, and in return,
you and I help her find someone.

180
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,360
I don't need to partner with you
to find Kate.

181
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,880
Well, now that I think about it,

182
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,280
you do have double locks
on all your doors,

183
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,200
no fashionable attire

184
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,720
I looked and not a single thing
past its expiration date

185
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,040
in your fridge.

186
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,440
Risk terrifies you,

187
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,120
and I'm a risk,
and it's quite obvious

188
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,600
that you're not willing
to risk anything for my sister,

189
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,400
so I'm sure you'll find Kate
the safe, regimented,

190
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,080
by-the-books way.

191
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,480
Seems to have gotten you pretty far.

192
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,440
Cute press conference by the way.

193
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,200
A million-dollar reward
is sure to get the woman

194
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,680
who owns an island
to spill the beans.

195
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Stop.

196
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,120
What do we need to do?

197
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,240
You need to power up your computer

198
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,000
and use that "all-access" crows
pass of yours

199
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
to find a guy named Ocean,

200
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
and I...

201
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,760
Need some more milk for my tea...

202
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Partner.

203
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,440
Whelan,
get art an antiquities started

204
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,000
on finding the original.

205
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,880
This is the mysterious
Jack Napier piece.

206
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,480
- Yeah.
- It's hideous.

207
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Who's Safiyah?

208
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
the woman
who has my daughter apparently.

209
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,200
We can't locate her,
but since this was the last thing

210
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,920
on Kate's phone,
we think it will help.

211
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,400
It was stolen apparently
from an active crime scene

212
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,960
and is now rumored
to be bouncing around

213
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
the black market.

214
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
On it, sir.

215
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,520
The clerk remembered seeing
a minivan lurking around

216
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
the comic book store.

217
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,880
That means it's possible
she's still stalking that place

218
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,080
all these years later.

219
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,200
You're telling me
a woman's been lurking

220
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,640
in the shadows,
plucking kids off the street

221
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,680
- for the last decade and a half?
- that's the point.

222
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,120
She doesn't need shadows.

223
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,640
She's a blue-eyed
suburban housewife

224
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
who targets kids no one cares about.

225
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,040
She figures out who has
a family, who doesn't,

226
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,160
and then she makes her move.
She sprayed something in my face.

227
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
I was so disoriented
by the time I woke up,

228
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,440
i couldn't figure out
where the hell I was.

229
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,120
Does Wayne have cameras
in wayside?

230
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,880
I don't know.

231
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,600
What'd this monster
do to you, Ryan?

232
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
What did she do?

233
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,920
She preyed
on every foster kid's greatest fear,

234
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
that we don't matter
because we're invisible.

235
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,800
Let me go.

236
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,880
You can't keep me here.

237
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,040
Well, when someone comes
to claim you, you can leave,

238
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,520
but until then,

239
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm just a good Samaritan
who found a lost child

240
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
wandering the streets.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
There's nothing good about you.

242
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,200
That's not true.

243
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Look.

244
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,160
There are 60 jelly beans in this jar,

245
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,440
and every day that you're here,
i'll remove one,

246
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,160
and by the time
there are no more jelly beans left,

247
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,680
you'll realize I am the only one
who's here for you.

248
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,680
Me the sweet
neighborhood Candy Lady.

249
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,720
Why are you doing this?

250
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm gonna help you find
your new family,

251
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,520
one who appreciates you,

252
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,200
one who sees you
for your true potential.

253
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,400
Someone will come for me
and kick your ass.

254
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,320
You're not gonna break me.

255
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,840
Do you really believe that?

256
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Think about it.

257
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,440
In all those comic books
that you love so much,

258
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,720
have you ever read
about one of those heroes

259
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,080
saving a kid like you?

260
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,560
The sad truth is she was right.

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,720
Heroes didn't save kids like me.

262
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,120
I'm so sorry.

263
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,840
Honestly, so much crap
has happened since,

264
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,720
I hadn't thought
about it much till now,

265
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,160
but the thing I remember is
by the time Kevin

266
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,000
gets to the bottom of this candy jar,
the Candy Lady will have him believe

267
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,440
he has no other choice.

268
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,760
Don't stop on my behalf.

269
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,440
It's normal to want to leave.

270
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,440
Strange place, strange people.

271
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,560
But soon it won't seem so strange.

272
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,640
I'm here for my jelly bean.

273
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,040
Someone will notice I'm missing.

274
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,880
Wouldn't that be
a nice change of pace?

275
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
That's when our little game started.

276
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,040
She had 60 days to break me,
and I had 60 days to prove her wrong.

277
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,560
Good morning, sweetie.

278
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,600
Still no inquiries.

279
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,120
Batman stopped the Joker last night.

280
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,680
It's all over the news.

281
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,600
Unfortunately...

282
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,200
You're not.

283
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,840
What are you doing?

284
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,560
What are you doing?

285
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,360
Don't you make a sound.

286
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Good morning, ma'am.

287
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,800
We're wondering if you can help us
with a missing persons case.

288
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,920
We're volunteers from Gotham-U

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,120
looking for this girl last seen
a couple weeks ago.

290
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,040
Got a lot of people worried.

291
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,040
I never saw her nervous,
never saw her sweat

292
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,480
but when I heard those voices
outside the window

293
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
I knew why.

294
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm here.

295
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,520
I saw that search party outside,
and I thought I'd done it

296
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,480
thought I'd won.
I thought I had proved to that bitch

297
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
that I was worth something
to someone.

298
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Help me. I'm here!

299
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,680
That is so upsetting.

300
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,040
What does the little girl look like?

301
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,240
She's 13, fair skin, blue eyes.

302
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,000
Fair skin, blue eyes.

303
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,440
She was last seen wearing
a necklace with a red stone.

304
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,680
Oh, my gosh. That is just awful.

305
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,440
I will definitely keep
my eyes peeled.

306
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
But they weren't looking for me.

307
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,200
They were looking for some white girl
because when white girls go missing

308
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,640
people get off their asses,
and they do something about it.

309
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Hang on.

310
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,720
A search team was looking
for a 13-year-old white girl

311
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,640
wearing a red stone necklace?

312
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,080
I know how to find the Candy Lady.

313
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
How?

314
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,720
That girl was Beth Kane.

315
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,200
You mind?

316
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,280
I really thought
you'd be better at this.

317
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,400
We're looking for a man named Ocean.

318
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,360
I'm happy to tell you
everything you want to know

319
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
about the seven seas,

320
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,440
but there's only so far I can get
without a last name.

321
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,160
Yeah. Coryana doesn't
really do last names.

322
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,480
Safiyah, Ocean, Tatiana.

323
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,480
It's all very biblical.

324
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,760
Then we need another angle.

325
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,280
In hindsight, I don't know why

326
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,240
I thought you could help me
figure out who this person is

327
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,760
considering you didn't even know
you were swapping spit

328
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,120
with your former flame.

329
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,720
I think it's time for you to go.

330
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,000
And I think you're haunted.

331
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,640
Kate disappeared with so much
left unsaid

332
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,840
between you two,
and it's killing you

333
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
which is precisely why I want
to work with you.

334
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,400
Because you'll stop
at nothing to find her.

335
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,960
Is that what you are? haunted?

336
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,200
What do you want me to say, Soph,

337
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,120
that I miss my sister
more than anything

338
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,280
that I regret spending the last year
terrorizing her

339
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,920
now that she's gone I realize
how much she meant to me?

340
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,960
If it's the truth.

341
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,840
Yo, Sophie. It's Luke Fox.

342
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,040
I can't be seen working with you.

343
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,360
I totally understand.

344
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,800
Alice, don't.

345
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
- What the hell?
- I didn't order takeout,

346
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,040
but I'll take you out anyway.

347
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,760
Kate was obsessed with finding Beth.

348
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,120
She collected every piece
of documentation

349
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,680
having to do with the search,
including logs of who searched where.

350
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,480
Now, we just have to find them.

351
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,320
Oh. I do not think
I was supposed to see this.

352
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,360
Oh, my god. thank you.

353
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
This is mine.

354
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,880
Please don't tell me
Kate was borrowing those.

355
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,760
No.
I've just kind of started moving in.

356
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,200
Wait. You went from the 56th floor
of a riverside penthouse to a loft

357
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,200
- above a loud gay bar?
- A gay bar that I now run.

358
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,400
Figured it would save me
the commute.

359
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
Bingo.

360
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
I get it.

361
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,640
You move into her place,
you take over her bar.

362
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,000
If I lost my sister,
I'd want to hang on

363
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,200
to every piece of her, too.

364
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,400
You know, speaking
of shorter commutes to work

365
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,080
you should totally live here.

366
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,960
- With you?
- I'm serious.

367
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,120
I mean, it's already paid for.

368
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,600
There's an extra bedroom.
The bathroom is huge, and no offense

369
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,440
your plant was looking
kind of sad in your van.

370
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,760
This has corner sunlight,
and there's a cute...

371
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,880
You don't have to sell my ass
on moving out of my van.

372
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes, I'd love to live here.

373
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,520
- Okay.
- Good.

374
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,960
Kate collected all of this as a kid?

375
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Yeah.

376
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,640
The GCPD stopped looking for Beth.

377
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,400
Search parties
stopped looking for Beth.

378
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,560
Eventually, even our dad
stopped looking for her

379
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,960
but Kate never did.

380
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,520
She reminds me of someone.

381
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,240
My ex.

382
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,080
She never stopped looking
for me either.

383
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,200
No. She got you, too?

384
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,560
That's what she thinks.

385
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,720
Told you I got your back.

386
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,040
She allowed herself to get caught
to help break me out.

387
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,080
It was the first time
I remember ever feeling like

388
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
I actually mattered to someone.

389
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,440
Well, if Angelique was there,

390
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
then maybe she remembers
where the house is.

391
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,360
- You got to call her.
- No, no, no, no, no.

392
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
I can't. Things took a turn.

393
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,680
We don't even speak anymore.

394
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,120
Listen.
As a person with season tickets

395
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,520
to crazy lesbian drama,
I can appreciate that,

396
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,680
but on behalf of Kevin Johnson,

397
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,280
you got to make an exception.

398
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
See?

399
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,880
Took a turn.

400
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,920
Must have changed her number.

401
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,960
Wait, wait. Maybe this will help.

402
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,440
Point rock,

403
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,160
Gotham hope search group,
Gotham U's youth volunteers.

404
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,280
According to this,
on Saturday, October 1,

405
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,760
they went door to door.

406
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,880
This is a map of their route.

407
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,400
This must be
where the Candy Lady lives.

408
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
- Yeah.
- I'm coming for you, Kevin.

409
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,760
Wait. Aren't you gonna suit up?

410
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,800
No. She needs to see my face.

411
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,520
Well, how can I help?

412
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,920
You can clear out my bedroom,

413
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,960
which you're currently using
as your walk-in closet.

414
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,840
I need to do this alone.

415
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,800
Go get Kevin back roomie.

416
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,880
Alice, put the gun down.

417
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,720
Sorry, soph, but threesomes
aren't my thing,

418
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,520
especially when one-third
worked with Kate

419
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,960
to lock me in at Arkham.

420
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,680
- He can help us.
- Us?

421
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,360
Are you not being held hostage
right now?

422
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
What the hell is happening?

423
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,840
Oh. Soph and I
have been tasked by Safiyah

424
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,680
to find a man, and once we do
and I kill him,

425
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,960
we get Kate back.

426
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,120
Wait. What?

427
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,760
You never said anything
about killing him.

428
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Didn't I?

429
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,520
Well, this one comes
with special instructions.

430
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,200
Abracadabra. I kill him with this.

431
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,960
Don't even think about it.

432
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,760
There's been a hundred tips
since the announcement,

433
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,160
but the one on wayside
sounds half legit.

434
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,080
I'll swing by, check it out,
let you know what I find.

435
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,440
Never touch my gun again.

436
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,160
So should I stay, or...

437
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,320
We can use your help.

438
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,120
Can I help you, sweetie?

439
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,920
I'm here to claim Kevin Johnson.

440
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,120
Who?

441
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,880
Fifteen, male, African-American,
last seen with you.

442
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,920
- And who might you be?
- Someone who cares.

443
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,800
I have seen him,

444
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,560
and he's found a family
who loves him.

445
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,000
Get her inside.

446
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,640
How exactly am I
supposed to find a guy

447
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,360
with no last name on a laptop?

448
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,040
Do you have anything
with actual calories in here?

449
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,040
There's rat poison under the sink.

450
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,480
Look. I appreciate that the crows

451
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,960
Can get past most encryption fields,

452
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,560
but that doesn't do us
any favors here.

453
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,880
This island must have
the most advanced tech in the world

454
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
because it's not showing
up on any satellites.

455
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
You can see for yourself.
It's a dead end.

456
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Wait. What is...

457
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,000
Any chance there's something
at Wayne with more firepower?

458
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,440
One hundred percent.

459
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,920
Let me do a deep dive,
and I'll see what I can find.

460
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,640
Behold the only carbs
in this hellhole.

461
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Baguette?

462
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
I'm good.

463
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,520
Then I guess we wait.

464
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,040
Tell me you recorded
<i>90-Day Fiancée.</i>

465
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm gonna find your dad
and see if his lead

466
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,240
amounted to anything.

467
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,480
If you want to avoid being arrested,

468
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,800
I'd stay put.

469
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,800
Can you pick me up
a six-pack when you're out?

470
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,040
I can't believe
you let yourself get caught.

471
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,160
I heard about this lady creeping
around galaxy hero comics,

472
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
so I went there and made sure
she saw me.

473
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,880
Why didn't anyone come for me?

474
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,560
Everyone thought you ran away,

475
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,440
but I knew you'd never leave
your "ghost kid" collection behind.

476
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
No!

477
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,640
This is exactly why nobody wants you.

478
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,880
Come on, Ryan.
We got to go before she wakes.

479
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,680
Ryan! Ryan, you got to fight this.

480
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,280
Ryan, fight!

481
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,160
Fight like ghost kid would fight.

482
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,960
Remember when he lost
his lame-ass invisibility

483
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,840
and everyone kept throwing crap
at him but he kept fighting anyway?

484
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,200
Ryan, get up!

485
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,240
You read "ghost kid"?

486
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,680
Come on, come on, come on.

487
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Okay.

488
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,560
Okay, okay.

489
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,000
Come on.

490
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,680
Oh. Right there.

491
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,520
You don't remember me,
huh, bitch?

492
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,960
I'm the girl you couldn't break.

493
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,960
Where is Kevin?

494
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,320
Kevin ran out of jelly beans.

495
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,960
Who did you sell him to?

496
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,120
No one ever really knew his face,

497
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,080
and now
that it's hidden behind a mask...

498
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,400
No one ever will.

499
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
You Rudy?

500
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,840
Kane, right?

501
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,560
What do you know?

502
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,160
Like I said on the phone,
before the plane took off,

503
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,160
I was working the tarmac
as a marshal,

504
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
you know, the guy
with the orange batons...

505
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,920
Yeah. I know what, what that is.

506
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,040
So, right before the plane takes off,

507
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,080
I notice a suspicious SUV
pull up to the aircraft,

508
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,320
and I'm thinking to myself,
"what the hell's going on?"

509
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,760
Because only catering
and emergency vehicles

510
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,080
are allowed that far out.

511
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,040
Damn, Kevin.

512
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,000
You smooth.

513
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,360
Now, let's go
and earn you your mask.

514
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,520
I'm here.
What makes you think Ocean is?

515
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,800
Because while you
and Alice were bickering

516
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,320
over what temp
to keep your thermostat

517
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,960
I was texting the only person
we know who knows Safiyah.

518
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Julia?

519
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Yeah.

520
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Turns out Julia
had heard Ocean left the island

521
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
a few years back

522
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,600
so she went looking
for him herself

523
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,520
hoping to get more intel on Safiyah.

524
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,760
So, where's he?

525
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,560
Well, she was waylaid,
but she did narrow down

526
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,600
his hideout
to four possible locations.

527
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,880
It looks like two were demolished

528
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,480
one is now an ice cream parlor,
and...

529
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,240
I'm sitting in front of the fourth.

530
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
Be careful.

531
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Copy that.

532
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,760
You break it, you bought it.

533
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,400
Do I know you?

534
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,680
If you did, you would
have seen that coming.

535
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,800
Let her go.

536
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,720
- Where's Ocean?
- Who?

537
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,040
Look. I just came here
looking to bag the place

538
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,240
and clearly, it's not worth it,

539
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,680
so you two can have it.

540
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,160
Just when I thought we were bonding.

541
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,000
Did you really think I'd trust you?

542
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,200
I want to find Kate just like you.

543
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,240
The question is why?

544
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,120
To make things right, to apologize,

545
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,520
to promise you'll change your ways?

546
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,040
i think we both know the answer
to that question.

547
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,160
I'm gonna find my sister,

548
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,640
and I'm gonna kill her.

549
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
Yo, Kevin.

550
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,080
Candy Lady says you're ripe.

551
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Prove it.

552
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Kill a crow.

553
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,600
But he didn't do nothing.

554
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,920
He's not on trial. You are.

555
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,160
You want to be in the family, right?

556
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
Prove it.

557
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,880
You don't have to do this.

558
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,880
You know, I do have a legit
tip for you, commander.

559
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,280
Don't come down
to False Face Society's hood solo.

560
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,720
He didn't.

561
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,080
And that's for making me
sweat out my edges.

562
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,160
Kevin, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

563
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,040
I want a family, and they want me.

564
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,480
Kid, put the gun down.

565
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,960
Kevin, listen to me.

566
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,560
You do this and you throw
your entire life away.

567
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,400
You don't know
anything about me.

568
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,680
Kevin, hey. Wait.

569
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
I do, though.

570
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,680
I know you have a brother.

571
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,600
I know that you think
no one cares about you

572
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,320
and I know
that if you pull that trigger

573
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,920
you'll become exactly what
the Candy Lady says you are...

574
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
invisible.

575
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,440
How do you know so much about me?

576
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,080
because I set out to find you

577
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,200
because you matter.

578
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
I see you

579
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,400
and you are meant
for so much more than this.

580
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,720
Protect him.

581
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,160
This is a False Face Society
hot spot.

582
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,560
There's bound to be more creeping.

583
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
How'd you know he was here?

584
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Easy.

585
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,760
I looked.

586
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,400
<i>Candice Long, aka the Candy Lady</i>

587
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,640
<i>was captured tonight
after Batwoman uncovered</i>

588
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,920
<i>a 20-year conspiracy involving
the False Face Society</i>

589
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,200
<i>and child trafficking.</i>

590
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,840
<i>This street-to-gang pipeline
includes Kevin Johnson</i>

591
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,240
<i>who credits both Batwoman and
crows commander Jacob Kane</i>

592
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,160
<i>for his rescue earlier tonight,</i>

593
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,560
<i>which begs the obvious question...</i>

594
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,680
<i>is there a bat-crow partnership
on the horizon?</i>

595
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,680
At least one of us
did something right today.

596
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Half right.

597
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,600
You know,
I never thought I'd say this,

598
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,280
but if Batwoman hadn't been there,

599
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,960
I probably wouldn't be here.

600
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,520
What happened?

601
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,880
Alice happened, sir.

602
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,600
She wants to find Kate

603
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,800
and it's imperative
that we find her first.

604
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,840
I'm totally stealing
this jacket, FYI.

605
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,520
So, you're already
raiding my closet.

606
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,560
She never stopped looking,

607
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,080
even when all the evidence said
that she was crazy.

608
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,800
You know, I can live in her place
and take over her bar

609
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,600
and hold on to all
the little pieces of her

610
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,120
but none of it will bring me closure

611
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,600
if I don't actually look.

612
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,600
I don't want to believe Alice,

613
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,200
but I, I don't want to believe
that Kate's dead either.

614
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,600
Then maybe it's time
we start thinking a little crazy.

615
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Yeah.

616
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,400
Hey. I got to go.

617
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,520
- Everything ok?
- Yeah. I'll let you know.

618
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,200
Look who might have found
the key to the Ocean.

619
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
Hi.
Hi.

620
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Hi.

621
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,640
What the hell was that?

622
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,600
Wrong number? seriously?

623
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,640
You didn't take my calls
for two years.

624
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,840
I had to play hard to get
for a minute.

625
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,040
Why am I here, Ryan?

626
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,520
Batwoman caught the Candy Lady.

627
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,440
- Damn.
- Yeah.

628
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Damn.

629
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,600
Next question.

630
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,440
Why couldn't you just tell me
that over text?

631
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,760
because maybe I miss the girl
who always had my back.

632
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,920
Truce?
