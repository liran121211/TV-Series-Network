1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,480
Hey, hey, hey!

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,600
Hey, hey. Eli, knock it off.
Do yourself a favor.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,440
Don't make me your problem.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,920
What the hell's going on?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,040
Sir, this man is trying
to steal a car.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,640
This guy is a known car thief.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,880
You know what?
I have photographic evidence.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Gun!

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,680
27-year-old male

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,160
with multiple gunshot wounds
to the abdomen.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,360
He lost consciousness en route.
Vitals are unstable

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,880
and he lost over a liter of blood
at the scene.

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,520
Get him up to the O.R. now.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
So, Agent Tavaroff,
the Crows have been

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,480
through this type
of officer-involved shooting before.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,040
We need to investigate
the incident with Luke Fox

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,880
and get your story,
so run us through what happened.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,360
Well, Agent Miller
and I were on patrol

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,680
when we heard a car alarm.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,360
We arrived to find
a suspicious-looking man

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,600
loitering near a vehicle.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
We approached.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,200
Suspect reached inside his jacket
and pulled out a gun.

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,960
Luke Fox used to work
for my daughter.

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,080
He seems more like the type to wield
a keyboard than a gun.

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,640
Well, I don't know him,

27
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,440
but I know what I saw.

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,080
Suspect turned to shoot

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,320
and I fired before he could
do the same to us.

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,480
Sounds like you should be commended
for your bravery, Agent Tavaroff.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,800
Any more questions?

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,560
We have to review
the bodycam footage.

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,160
Send in Agent Miller.

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
Of course, sir. Thank you.

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,280
Lost his pulse.
We need to start CPR now.

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
He's flatlining.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hello?

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
Dad?

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,600
How many times was she shot?

40
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,480
{\an5}Two. The first bullet caused injury
to his kidney, spleen, colon.

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,800
The second tore through a major vein,
causing massive blood loss.

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,040
{\an5}Already coded twice
and right now, he's in a coma.

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,360
They're not sure
if he's gonna make it.

44
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,000
{\an5}Wait. Tell me everything
that happened.

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,760
{\an5}We were on the phone.
He saw some guy jack a car

46
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,040
- so he said, he would handle it.
- What do you mean "handle it"?

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,720
Oh, god. I don't know.

48
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,760
{\an5}So, when he didn't call me back,
I got worried and...

49
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,320
{\an5}You realized he couldn't handle it.

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,240
{\an5}- Why didn't Luke just call it in?
- I told him to, but he said that

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,920
{\an5}he recognized the guy
from your holding cell.

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,840
{\an5}- Eli or something.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. White boy.

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
{\an5}He was in jail with us
for stealing a car.

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,240
{\an5}You think that he did this?

55
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,920
{\an5}For his sake...

56
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,800
{\an5}I hope not.

57
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,840
{\an5}I will let Batwoman sort
that one out.

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,440
{\an5}I've nominated myself
to save Luke's life.

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,880
So, why aren't you
at Gotham General right now?

60
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
Because Gotham General
doesn't have this.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,520
Things I don't want
to know for a thousand, Alex.

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,960
{\an5}Curiouser and curiouser.

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
What?

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
{\an5}Typically when one storms out
after winning an argument

65
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,080
{\an5}they don't come crawling back.
Takes the drama out of it.

66
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,200
Figured.

67
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,080
I'd ditch the evidence.

68
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,800
{\an5}Probably for the best considering
whose daughter that is.

69
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,120
No idea.

70
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,640
Riddle me that.

71
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,760
{\an5}Might want to ditch this, too.

72
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,400
{\an5}So... You think I won the argument?

73
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,680
{\an5}No. I think you stopped me
from retrieving the password

74
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,360
to Kate's memory bank
and now, I'm left

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,000
puzzling through her files,
trying to retrieve some answer key

76
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
{\an5}so I can get Kate's memory back.

77
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,520
Still won't give up on Kate?

78
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,120
I know why I'm invested,

79
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,880
but why is Black Mask so obsessed
with knowing all the dirty details

80
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,200
of the Kane family?

81
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,160
Our dead doctor's
been sending him her research.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't care.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I told you how I feel.

84
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,120
Your sister isn't worth
you getting killed over.

85
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Fine.

86
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,760
I guess I'm on my own then.

87
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
I didn't do anything.

88
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,160
You're driving a stolen car, dumbass.

89
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,600
I prefer the term borrowed.

90
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,560
Yeah?
Were you borrowing a car earlier

91
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,880
when you shot the guy
who tried to stop you?

92
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
It wasn't like that.
The Crows rolled up out of nowhere.

93
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,640
What do you mean the Crows rolled up?

94
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
They did this?

95
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,120
I've never shot a gun in my life.

96
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,880
How are you here
and he's in the hospital?

97
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
They saw us both.

98
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,760
I may have said
he was boosting the ride.

99
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,920
You think maybe
that was gonna get him shot?

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,080
He was stupid enough
to grab his phone.

101
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,920
Next thing I knew,
someone yelled out "gun"

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and then fired.

103
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,080
How the hell did you get away?

104
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,920
I saw a chance and I ran.

105
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,600
They didn't bother to follow.

106
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,880
I swear. That's how it went down.

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,720
What did they look like?

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,320
Badge numbers, I.D.s, plates.

109
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,400
Ta... Tavaroff.

110
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,120
I heard the one guy scream,
"What'd you do?" At him.

111
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,440
You know, if that guy
had just minded his business

112
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,840
and let me take the car

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,440
I'd have been out of there
and he'd be fine.

114
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,880
You're saying this is his fault?

115
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,600
It's the truth.

116
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,640
He didn't need
to make me his problem.

117
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,680
And the Crows didn't need
to shoot him.

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,920
Sounds like your beef is with them,
so how about letting me go.

119
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,400
How about not?

120
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,920
Maybe you should have minded
your own business.

121
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
Dad.

122
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,360
- Dad.
- You know it's impossible

123
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,800
to get your old man's attention
when he's deep in thought.

124
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Bruce.

125
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
What are you doing here?

126
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,080
You called me here.

127
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,040
I... I didn't...

128
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,960
Why would I call you here?

129
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,000
Luke, you've been shot.

130
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,760
You brought me here
because you have a choice to make.

131
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,160
Gotham reels
from the latest shooting

132
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,760
of a black man
at the hands of the Crows.

133
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,960
This incident comes on the heels
of the recent Crows controversy

134
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,960
{\an5}where some say excessive
firepower was used

135
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,080
{\an5}to contain the latest
Snakebite epidemic.

136
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
<i>Crow officials have yet
to release a statement on the issue</i>

137
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,640
<i>and per their official policy</i>

138
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,520
<i>they refuse to release
the names of the agents involved.</i>

139
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,280
<i>Behind me,
protestors are gathering...</i>

140
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,400
How much longer?

141
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,000
An hour or two tops.

142
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,400
Crows let the real suspect get away,
didn't even bother chasing him.

143
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
I left him for the GCPD.

144
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,400
They can't get away with this.
We have to get justice for Luke.

145
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,640
Focus on saving him.
I'll take care of the Crows.

146
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,160
How do you access the freaking
internet on this thing?

147
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,920
I think...

148
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Okay.

149
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,880
- Son of a bitch.
- Is that the agent who shot Luke?

150
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,680
Russell Tavaroff.

151
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,280
He was responsible
for the massacre at the church,

152
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,160
crashed my False Face operation
two weeks ago.

153
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,320
Of course, he did this!

154
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,480
Hey. You need backup?
Not me, but I can call Sophie.

155
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,240
I want to see how Russell does
against someone who is bulletproof.

156
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,040
Hang on, Luke. Help is on the way.

157
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,920
You've got to be kidding me.

158
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,240
Get out of here.

159
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,320
I'm going to assume
if Batwoman were here

160
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,080
she wouldn't have sent you
to shoo me away

161
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,400
with a big box store brand taser.

162
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,800
Rest assured...

163
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm not afraid of you.

164
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,640
Yeah. Okay.
How are you still even here?

165
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,560
Didn't False Face deal
with you already?

166
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,600
Actually, that's what brings me.

167
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,560
I was wondering
if you had any unexpected run-ins

168
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,400
with Black Mask's side chick?

169
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,680
Goes by Circe.

170
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Never heard of her.

171
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Are you sure?

172
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,880
She used to run around
in a wooden hockey mask.

173
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,000
Now, she's
a supermodel-esque assassin.

174
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,240
I'm sorry. Why am I supposed
to care about this person?

175
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
You aren't...

176
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,680
and turns out,
she doesn't care about you either.

177
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,040
Well, helpful as always. Toodles.

178
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,520
There's always a reason with you.
Who is she?

179
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,000
Turns out Black Mask
is the only person

180
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,920
who hates the Kane family
more than I do

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,840
and as much
as I'm unwilling to admit it,

182
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,880
that includes you.

183
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,760
Watch your back, steppy.

184
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,320
So, you came here to warn me
out of the goodness

185
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,720
of your empty chest cavity?

186
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,640
Enemy of my enemy and all that.

187
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,200
Aren't you besties with Batty?

188
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,800
Maybe it's worth keeping her
within reach if you want to live.

189
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,400
I know you're in love...

190
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,800
And maybe if you'd seen
it earlier in your life,

191
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
you might not be the monster
that you are today.

192
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,880
As much as I hate you, Alice,

193
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,160
everyone deserves love.

194
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,000
Not so easy now, is it?

195
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,760
Confess to what you did and maybe
I'll let you keep breathing.

196
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,720
- It's not your fight.
- Yeah?

197
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,920
You shot an innocent,
unarmed black man.

198
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,280
- The fight is in my DNA.
- Innocent?

199
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,200
I looked him up.
Kid was released from jail

200
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,080
hours before we caught him stealing
a car.

201
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,960
He broke the law
just like you're doing right now.

202
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,400
Body go bye- bye?

203
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,120
Can't be traced back to us.

204
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
"Us".

205
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,560
That word does have
a nice domestic flare to it,

206
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,640
even in the context
of disposing of a body.

207
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,200
You made your priorities clear.

208
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,400
I'm headed out, so if there's a point
you're trying to make,

209
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
make it.

210
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,120
I betrayed you, I killed you,

211
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,560
I... I even chose my sister over you

212
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,600
and yet, still
I haven't fully pushed you away,

213
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,640
so either you're a masochist

214
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,160
or you hate yourself,
but which one is it?

215
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,000
You're infuriating, unpredictable
and yes, you tried to kill me...

216
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,760
But I can't help who I love.

217
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,280
We're survivors, orphans
who made our way

218
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,560
in this world alone except somehow,

219
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,400
we found each other.

220
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,680
Whatever we felt for each other

221
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,400
was enough
to bring back our memories.

222
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,200
That's real, Alice.

223
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
My whole life I've been caged...

224
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,840
by Cartwright and then Safiyah,

225
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,240
even my own sister.

226
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,920
For the first time, I'm free...

227
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,640
to make my own choices.

228
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,640
- So choose.
- No.

229
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,480
Because I want it all.
I... I... I want you

230
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,960
and I want my sister back
and if you truly loved me,

231
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,360
you would want me
to have it all, too.

232
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,400
Have to admit kind
of surprised you called me.

233
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,080
- Don't know many Crows.
- Ex-Crow.

234
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,000
Them either. I need your help.

235
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
You okay?

236
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,040
- You should see the Crows's truck.
- The Crows ran you down?

237
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,000
One of Russell Tavaroff's boys.

238
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,400
He has people watching his back,

239
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,120
so I need you
to tell me everything about him

240
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,360
and his crew.

241
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,400
Are you sure you don't want to be
with Luke right now?

242
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,240
- Luke's gonna be fine.
- Fine?

243
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,040
He's unconscious in the ICU.

244
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Mary's on her way
to the hospital with Desert Rose.

245
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,240
It will save his life.

246
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,440
Excuse me, I need to see Luke.

247
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,680
And I need you to step back.

248
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,800
Since when did this ICU room become
the hottest club in Gotham?

249
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
No one's allowed in.

250
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
No.

251
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,200
I just spoke to Luke's doctor
and I'm not no one.

252
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,480
I'm Mary Hamilton,
daughter of Jacob Kane, your boss,

253
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,200
so unless you want
to be pulling shifts

254
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,400
at the Gotham Mall,
I suggest you let me in.

255
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,160
We're here on your father's orders.

256
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,480
<i>The Crows have issued a statement
on the incident</i>

257
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,200
<i>along with newly released
body camera footage.</i>

258
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,240
<i>We should warn viewers
that this footage is disturbing.</i>

259
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,040
Wait. How was Luke holding a gun?

260
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,800
This makes me want to puke.

261
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,840
{\an5}<i>The Crows have just released the name
of the armed suspect... Lucas Fox</i>

262
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,960
<i>who was released from jail
hours before the confrontation.</i>

263
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,440
<i>The gun found at the scene
was also connected</i>

264
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,560
<i>to a recent gas station robbery.</i>

265
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,640
<i>27-year-old Fox is the son
of the late Wayne Foundation CEO</i>

266
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,320
<i>Lucius Fox and currently works
as head of security at Wayne Tower.</i>

267
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,640
They literally photoshopped
a gun into Luke's hand

268
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,080
in the bodycam footage.

269
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Not just any gun.
It was linked to an armed robbery,

270
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,800
which means when Luke wakes up
they're gonna charge him for robbery

271
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
and attempted assault.

272
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,360
If Luke wakes.

273
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,800
There are two agents
stationed outside his door.

274
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,920
Mary couldn't get them removed.

275
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,400
If Mary can't administer
the Desert Rose...

276
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,880
Luke's gonna die.

277
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,520
How is there a damn video
of Luke carrying a gun?

278
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,520
- I don't know.
- Well, think!

279
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,760
Because I highly doubt Tavaroff
has a degree in alpha bro

280
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,880
and digital art!

281
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,920
Tavaroff is a bully
with a bunch of lackeys,

282
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,680
who will do whatever he wants.
It was probably one of them.

283
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,040
A murder of Crows.

284
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,120
Okay. So tell me how to get
my hands on the original footage.

285
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
What time is it?

286
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,920
1.45.

287
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,040
All the bodycam metadata is sent
to the Crows's air-gapped server,

288
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
which always deletes
at 3.00am every night.

289
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,800
If we can get
the metadata off that server

290
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,760
we can compare it
to the footage playing on the news

291
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,360
and prove the original was altered.

292
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,400
Well, that just flowed
right off your tongue.

293
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,720
What are you talking about?

294
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Tell me...

295
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,880
How many times
have you seen something

296
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,000
like this happen
and never said anything?

297
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,480
How many times have you participated
in something like this?

298
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,600
Never. I never knew it went this far
and when I did, I quit.

299
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Yesterday!

300
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,240
Not long ago,
you threw down the badges

301
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,360
of the two agents
who ran over Wolf Spider

302
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,320
and you told me
you could change the culture.

303
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,760
- You knew it was broken.
- Ryan, I didn't shoot Luke

304
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,560
so please stop acting
like this is my fault.

305
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,560
It's not! It's mine!

306
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,440
- What?
- It's my fault.

307
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,040
Luke got shot because of me.

308
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,240
That's crazy.
Why would you blame yourself?

309
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,360
I gave him hell
for being a bystander.

310
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,080
I called him privileged.

311
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,440
Ryan, you didn't do this.

312
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,160
Luke... Put himself in the way...

313
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,560
because of me.

314
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,880
Sophie, he can't die.

315
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,560
How are you here right now?

316
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,160
How is... how is... he?

317
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
What is going on?

318
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,160
Where do you think we are right now?

319
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,760
- In your office.
- Are we, though, really?

320
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
This is...

321
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,480
My subconscious.

322
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Exactly.

323
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,200
Right now,
you are lying in a hospital room.

324
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,400
Doctors have no idea how to fix you.

325
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,960
A machine is keeping you alive,

326
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,800
and you have a choice to make.

327
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,000
You can hang on,

328
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,600
or you can let go and join him.

329
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,960
Okay. If this is purgatory,
does that mean that you're dead?

330
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,800
You tell me, Luke.
It's your subconscious.

331
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,560
So... What's it gonna be, buddy?

332
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,640
Bruce, I don't know.
I just want to go talk to my dad.

333
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,120
No. Doesn't work that way.

334
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
What do you mean?

335
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,640
He is right there.
Why can't I just go talk to him?

336
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,160
Because if you go talk
to the old man, that's it.

337
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
You're dead.

338
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,400
Your decision's been made.

339
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,560
There's no going back.

340
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Moore, I thought you quit.

341
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,480
Come to change your mind?

342
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,160
Russell Tavaroff
is not the agent you think he is.

343
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,840
Well, I could say the same about you.

344
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,680
Doesn't reflect well on me
when my best agent hands

345
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,400
in her badge without even
discussing it with me first.

346
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,160
There's nothing to discuss.

347
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,640
Last year,
we said we'd drain the swamp

348
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,600
once we discovered
Agent Robles was hired

349
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,240
to kill Lucius Fox.

350
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,280
Now, we're right back
where we started,

351
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,320
another Crow lying
about another Fox case.

352
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,360
You quit less than 24 hours ago,

353
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,560
and then you come in here
and you tell me

354
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,480
how to run my operation?

355
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,280
I'm asking to reexamine
the facts of the case.

356
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,760
Two years ago,
I tracked down a rapist.

357
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,320
He attacked several women,
we all knew he did it,

358
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,040
but the evidence was circumstantial.
It wouldn't hold up in court

359
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,000
so when airtight evidence
appeared at the last minute,

360
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,040
I didn't question where it came from
because he was guilty.

361
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,200
We put a rapist behind bars.

362
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,160
I know we did,
but we also bent the rules.

363
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,560
And how many lives have we saved?

364
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,960
All I'm saying is if evidence
could appear out of thin air once

365
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,640
it can appear again.

366
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,560
I have been loyal
to you since day one.

367
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,880
Five years, no questions asked,
but...

368
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,560
Once I saw the truth,
I couldn't unsee it

369
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,560
so I'm begging you, sir, please

370
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,240
open your eyes
before anyone else has to die.

371
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,120
<i>Just landed in the Crows' nest.</i>

372
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,840
Copy. Just hacked
into the Crows's camera feed.

373
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,200
You've got six minutes
before the data wipe activates.

374
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,360
- What about Luke?
- It's in motion.

375
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,600
So, hot tip.

376
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Coffee at the hospital cafe
is extra tragic,

377
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,840
but I brought these fresh.

378
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,200
I actually came back
to apologize for my behavior earlier.

379
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,600
You know, "I'm Mary Hamilton."

380
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,160
Who do I think
I am... Kimmy K, right?

381
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,680
You're just doing your jobs and...

382
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,280
So heroically, too.

383
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,440
The entire city of Gotham

384
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,280
owes you both
a huge debt of gratitude.

385
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,880
From us all.

386
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,080
This is so stupid. Dad.

387
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Dad, it's Luke.

388
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,080
Okay. What is happening?

389
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Science.

390
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,040
The land of the living
is pulling you back.

391
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,640
Vitals are stabilizing,
wounds are healing.

392
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,080
On paper, you could get up tomorrow
and go for a jog.

393
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,680
You're about survive, my friend.

394
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,360
Now, are you staying,
or are you going?

395
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,320
Because if you wait much longer

396
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,960
that decision
is gonna be made for you.

397
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
I'm...

398
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
Bruce.

399
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,760
- You asked to see me, Commander.
- Yeah.

400
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,960
Can you, help me
with something, Tavaroff?

401
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,960
Luke Fox never
had so much as a speeding ticket

402
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,400
parking ticket, fix-it ticket.

403
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,760
Hell, he's never even had
a late payment on a bill.

404
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,080
How does a guy
like that suddenly graduate

405
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,160
to GTA, robbery
and possession of a firearm?

406
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,200
I can't say, sir.
You'll have to ask him when he wakes.

407
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,880
The Snakebite case two days ago
resulted in nearly a dozen deaths.

408
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,040
Agent Moore's final report

409
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,560
indicated requesting
the use of nonlethal force

410
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,080
to subdue the users.

411
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,880
Well, my crew and I
were surrounded by cannibals

412
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,200
high out of their mind, sir.

413
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,120
Well, you could have used tear gas,
stun guns.

414
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Come on. This organization
has its own damn armory.

415
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,040
Well, if we had an IA investigation
every time a firearm was discharged

416
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,800
we'd never make it back
into the field, sir.

417
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,040
And if I was to look
at all your cases

418
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,640
how many of these instances
would I find?

419
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,160
How many would we find
in yours, Commander?

420
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,520
What about lighting up Batwoman
at Goliaths Stadium?

421
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,000
The Crows have never shied away
from using extreme force.

422
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,040
That is not why I started the Crows.

423
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,240
Well, that's who we are now.

424
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,960
Well, then maybe we need
to take a long, hard look

425
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,280
at ourselves and ask
if the Crows deserve to exist.

426
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,040
In the meantime,
I want your badge, I want your gun

427
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,200
and I want you out of here.

428
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,440
You are sidelined until I can conduct
a full investigation into you

429
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,800
and your little posse.

430
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,160
If that's what you got to do, sir.

431
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,080
Or maybe... We'll be just fine
if we get rid of the problem.

432
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,720
- I'm here.
- Okay, Batwoman.

433
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
According to the report,

434
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,520
Tavaroff's footage
will be in stack 815.

435
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,680
It should be on your right.

436
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,280
We really need you
to wait in the visitor's lounge.

437
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,120
Oh, I'm just saying
I am happy to consult my dad

438
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,320
about better benefits.

439
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,440
I mean, you bravely put yourselves
in the line of fire

440
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,040
and that's your pension?
Seriously, I...

441
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,080
Think about your life,
think about your choices

442
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,000
because the Crows hurt people
like my friend Luke

443
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,760
so just ask yourselves
who are you really protecting here?

444
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,360
Mary Hamilton, crazy seeing you here.

445
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,800
Evan Blake.

446
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,960
I bought you a coffee.

447
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,120
You failed to mention Luke
was a cutie pie.

448
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,040
Luke got the Desert Rose.

449
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,240
- Is he awake?
<i>- Not yet.</i>

450
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,880
We're at three minutes to 3.00am.

451
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,840
- Password worked. I'm in.
<i>- Good.</i>

452
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,720
Found the bodycam files.

453
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,120
- Oh, no.
- Talk to me.

454
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,800
There's hundreds
of files in Tavaroff's folder.

455
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
If it's by date,
it'd be the last entry.

456
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,720
They're not saved by date

457
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,920
because why would the Crows
make something easy?

458
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Can you get Luke's
before it's destroyed?

459
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,600
I can't find Luke's footage.

460
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,720
- Oh, my god.
- What?

461
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,880
Tavaroff and his murder
have the commander.

462
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,640
He's not conscious.
You need to stop them.

463
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,440
I need to save Luke
before these files are erased.

464
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,840
You don't kidnap the commander
and plan to let him live.

465
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,480
They're gonna kill Jacob Kane.

466
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,640
Figure out where they took him.

467
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,280
Saw the Snakebite kits in the trash
when I was tying him up.

468
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,400
Commander's a fricking junkie.

469
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
So...

470
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Let's give him...

471
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,360
the worst high he's ever had.

472
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,200
Dude, three? That'll kill him.

473
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,760
He was gonna turn us all in.
It's either us or him.

474
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,080
Do you want to go to jail?

475
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,520
How about you or you?

476
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,680
All it takes is a half-wit judge

477
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,000
and a soft jury and we're all done.

478
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,760
That's what I thought.

479
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
Now...

480
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Shut up...

481
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,640
and let the Commander...

482
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,760
enjoy his last high.

483
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Lights.

484
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,160
I wanted you to see this.

485
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,320
Have fun at Blackgate.

486
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Thanks.

487
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,920
You know what
I gave up to save your ass?

488
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,240
Clearing Luke Fox's name.

489
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,920
Your boys are trying
to ruin his life.

490
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,800
- I... I didn't know it was this bad.
- Yeah? Well, you should have.

491
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,080
You want to do good, I get it.
I bend the rules too

492
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,040
but at least I have a code.
What's yours?

493
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,760
I gave you the match
and the gas can, Commander.

494
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,640
It's up to you to do the rest.

495
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,800
Burn it down

496
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,240
or you're just as bad as them.

497
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,280
Luke's mom just pulled into the lot.

498
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,800
Why isn't he waking up?

499
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,640
It doesn't make any sense.

500
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,360
His vitals have stabilized.
He should be awake by now.

501
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,840
After one dose...

502
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,760
of the Desert Rose serum

503
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,920
my Kryptonite poisoning
went away immediately.

504
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,480
Are you sure Wolf Spider
did it right?

505
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm positive. I watched him do it.

506
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,840
- Then why isn't it working?
- I don't know.

507
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,400
I should have been
the one to inject it.

508
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,400
I should have been there.
I could have done more.

509
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,640
Two Crows agents shot
and framed and Luke Fox

510
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,360
by placing a gun
at the scene when he, in fact

511
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,240
did not have a weapon
in his possession.

512
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,920
Even more disturbing,
the doctored bodycam footage

513
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,600
to make it look as though the phone
in Mr. Fox's hand was that gun.

514
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,280
Will you be releasing
the real bodycam footage?

515
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,920
Unfortunately, it was destroyed

516
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,560
but I am personally willing
to testify to this in court.

517
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,040
In the meantime, the agents involved
in this deep fake are being held

518
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,960
for assault with the intent to kill.

519
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,880
I am lucky that Batwoman
was there to save my life.

520
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,160
What does this say
about the Crows as an organization

521
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
and you as its leader?

522
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,920
Well, I started the Crows

523
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,600
because I wanted to protect Gotham
from the kind of monsters

524
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,800
who would highjack a school bus

525
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,640
and run a family off
the road like they were nothing

526
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,120
but somewhere along the way,
the Crows began cutting corners

527
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,280
to get results.

528
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,480
While Agent Tavaroff
is directly responsible

529
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,320
for what happened to Mr. Fox

530
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,320
I am guilty of harboring these types
of actions for years.

531
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,120
<i>I want to offer a direct apology
to the Fox family for all the hurt</i>

532
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,160
<i>that we have caused,
but these are not isolated moments</i>

533
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,440
<i>and apologies mean nothing
without actions.</i>

534
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,080
<i>I have therefore come
to the conclusion</i>

535
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,320
<i>that there is only one
way to make amends.</i>

536
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,400
<i>As the founder
and majority shareholder</i>

537
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,920
I have decided to disband
the Crows effective immediately.

538
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,880
What will this mean
for the security of Gotham?

539
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,080
<i>When did you first...</i>

540
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
You did that.

541
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,960
You shut them down.

542
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,880
They can't hurt anyone anymore.

543
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,920
We did it, Luke

544
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,960
so I'm gonna need you
to wake up now, please

545
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,160
because there
is no Bat team without you.

546
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
Come on, Luke.

547
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Wake up.

548
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,000
Who else is gonna roll
their eyes at me

549
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,880
every time I threaten
to redecorate the Batcave...

550
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,240
Or ignore my fashion advice,
even though clearly only own a suit?

551
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,800
It's me and you
in the Batcave, Luke, so...

552
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,000
We need you.

553
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,000
I need you, so...

554
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,760
- This is so unfair.
- None of this is fair.

555
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,240
It doesn't matter
that you worked for Batman

556
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,480
or both Batwomen

557
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,000
that you saved hundreds of lives

558
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,320
cleaned up entire neighborhoods.
You have given hope

559
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,600
to thousands of people.

560
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,560
You still got shot...

561
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
And there is a whole mess
of people out there

562
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,760
willing to believe
that you deserved it

563
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,840
just because you're black.

564
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,320
Then what's the point?

565
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,840
It's not for me to say

566
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,160
but you need to decide...

567
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,720
- Now.
- You left

568
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,600
and I... I've always wondered why.

569
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,920
Why you just walked away,
hung up the cape...

570
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,560
And it's because it's just all
so damn depressing.

571
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,720
Because no matter what good
we try to put into the world

572
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,160
it's still a world
where this happens.

573
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,920
And I don't want to live
in that world anymore.

574
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,280
I want to be with my dad.

575
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
And that's your choice.

576
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,720
<i>Look up...</i>

577
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,040
Okay. Hey, Dad. It's Luke.

578
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,760
I'm... I'm here.

579
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,000
I think he's waking up.

580
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Luke.

581
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,440
You're alive.

582
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,840
Welcome back.

583
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,640
You did the right thing.

584
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,520
Thanks to you.

585
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,560
Doesn't matter how we get there, sir.

586
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,840
What matters is that we do.

587
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,000
This is why I always looked up
to you.

588
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,400
You were always
my best agent, Moore.

589
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,000
The fact that I've broken
into this parking structure

590
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,120
more times
than I can count says the Crows

591
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,080
maybe weren't all that great
at security anyway.

592
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,880
It's been a long day, Alice.
What do you want?

593
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,440
I need your help...

594
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,880
and I know what you're thinking...

595
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,560
"Me help you? I've made
it my paternal legacy

596
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,360
to disappoint you
at every opportunity".

597
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Alice.

598
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Kate's alive.

599
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,840
- Not this again.
- No, Daddy, she's alive.

600
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,040
Not maybe possibly being held
on an invisible island somewhere.

601
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,120
She's here in Gotham
under the influence of Black Mask

602
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,760
so you and I are gonna do
the one thing

603
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,760
that you Kate never did for me.

604
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,120
We are gonna stop at nothing,

605
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,560
and we're gonna get her back.
