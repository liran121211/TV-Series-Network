1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,400
<i>Good evening,
fair citizens of Gotham City.</i>

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,880
<i>Black Mask here.</i>

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,000
<i>I ask you to look past
this ghoulish veil</i>

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,720
<i>and realize it is not the
affectation of a madman</i>

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,840
<i>but rather the necessary concealment</i>

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,440
<i>of an altruist, so...</i>

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,200
This isn't <i>America's Funniest Pets.</i>

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,080
<i>How does one fix...</i>

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,880
- It's on every channel.
<i>- A broken city?</i>

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,880
<i>Well, I've heard the phrase "defund
the police" bandied about. Please.</i>

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,720
The GCPD can't afford
the hole in its doughnut.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,480
Well, what about Arkham Asylum,
that house of horrors

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,920
that you fund with your tax dollars,
or Blackgate Prison

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,200
too violent for Jacob Kane

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
loving father of lunatic at large
Alice of Wonderland?

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,280
Well, how about Gotham City Hall then

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,120
<i>or the judges or the D.A.
or the banks,</i>

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,680
<i>all chock full of predatory
degenerates</i>

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,640
<i>so, crooked they've got to screw
their pants on in the morning?</i>

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,640
<i>And don't even get me
started on Batwoman</i>

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,320
<i>operating without checks or balances</i>

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,800
<i>leaving the collateral damage
of an untold number</i>

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,320
<i>of innocents in her wake.</i>

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,160
<i>Why are we allowing
these self-serving bandits</i>

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,680
<i>to dictate to us what the
terms fair and just mean?</i>

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,640
<i>We should be dictating
these terms to them</i>

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,520
<i>so I'm asking you to join me
for an evening of anarchy.</i>

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
<i>Help me raze every single one
of these moldering institutions</i>

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,200
<i>to their foundations.</i>

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,720
<i>I've dropped masks
at a dozen street corners.</i>

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,040
Stand up, strap one on,
become your own vigilante

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,480
and when the dust finally settles
over our failed system

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,960
well, Black Mask
will still be standing

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,400
ready to lead you to your liberation

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,960
because you know what
they say about power?

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,280
Use it...

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,120
<i>Or lose it.</i>

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,440
<i>Dear Gotham,
I loved being Batwoman</i>

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,800
<i>and I want you to know I never took
wearing the symbol for granted...</i>

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,040
{\an5}<i>Because I know how badly this
city needed a protector...</i>

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,240
<i>Someone to inspire hope</i>

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,120
<i>someone to prove that there's
something better for us out there.</i>

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
{\an5}<i>You've always needed a hero, Gotham</i>

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,440
{\an5}<i>but in this moment,
maybe that's not me.</i>

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,640
{\an5}<i>But I ask you to
look past this ghoulish veil</i>

46
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
{\an5}<i>and realize it is not the
affectation...</i>

47
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,400
Okay. Bat team mission to-do list.

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
{\an5}Number one, find Circe.
Number two, get Kate back.

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,040
{\an5}Number three, apprehend Black Mask.

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,880
{\an5}Number four, stop a possible faction

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,320
{\an5}of very angry people

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
{\an5}from overthrowing the government.

53
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,160
- Am I missing anything?
- Yeah, how?

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,920
{\an5}So it was my job to make the list.

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Okay.

56
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,160
{\an5}Even if we did find Kate

57
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,320
{\an5}without the internet, without
Wayne satellites, without phones

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,320
and then I somehow managed
to take out

59
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,960
{\an5}a homicidal sadist
and his armed gang

60
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,840
{\an5}and then I kidnapped
Circe without my Batsuit

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,680
{\an5}it still doesn't mean
we'll be able to pull Kate out.

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,200
{\an5}Enigma is dead, trinkets didn't work.

63
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,200
Her own family barely made a dent.

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,800
There has to be something
that we're not thinking of.

65
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,720
{\an5}Yeah, but first, we need to find her.

66
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,040
First, we find Black Mask,
then we find Circe.

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,120
{\an5}Whatever, here's the list.
Renumber it however you'd like.

68
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,600
{\an5}Sophie is on her way with supplies.
I need to head back to the clinic

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,480
and prep for a very busy night.

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,040
{\an5}When you guys come up
with a game plan

71
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
{\an5}call me or send a raven or whatever.

72
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,640
{\an5}Oh, that reminds me.

73
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,800
They max out after five miles,
but they're better than nothing.

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,480
{\an5}So click the button
on the side to talk.

75
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,120
{\an5}Yes, thank you. We all know
how walkie-talkies work.

76
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
{\an5}Be safe. I love you guys.

77
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,840
{\an5}I've watched this stream 50 times,
I'm at 5% battery

78
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,200
{\an5}and I have no idea where
Black Mask is broadcasting from.

79
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,920
Wait, hang on.

80
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,720
I think I got something.

81
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,600
{\an5}Now Batman, there's a classic hero.

82
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,480
{\an5}Great voice, no shame.

83
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,320
{\an5}I mean, he built abdominals
directly into his suit, right?

84
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,240
And he kept trophies
from every single nut job

85
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,400
he dumped at Arkham.
Keeping them off the streets my ass.

86
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,000
{\an5}He wanted to relish in
the feeling of being powerful.

87
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Who can blame him?

88
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,400
In my day,

89
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,040
Venom turned Bane

90
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,520
into a hulking terror.

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,680
Guy could rip the tooth
out of your smile

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
while shrugging off a
pipe wrench, you know?

93
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,040
Don't worry, Mr. Tavaroff.
I wouldn't do that to you.

94
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,320
And you convinced your lab rat

95
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,440
that the tranquilizing properties
of the Snakebite's vapor

96
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,120
would counteract
the Venom's roid rage.

97
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Well, let's face it. Everybody wants

98
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,000
a bulletproof army,
but nobody wants to deal

99
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,640
with Bane's tantrums all day.

100
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,440
So you're building an
indestructible army.

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,760
Was Black Mask not scary enough?

102
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,120
I don't want to be feared,
sweetheart.

103
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,240
I want to be loved.

104
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,160
By dawn tomorrow,
the GCPD will have collapsed

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,880
under the weight of
its own depravity,

106
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,080
and Mayor Akins will have been,
shall we say, removed from office

107
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,440
and they by noon,

108
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,240
well, the good people of Gotham

109
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,400
and there's millions
of them, believe it or not...

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,040
will be quaking with fear.

111
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,880
"Who will save us now?"

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,520
And that's
when Roman Sionis swoops in

113
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,920
and puts a bullet right through
Black Mask's shiny skull.

114
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,920
This of course after
I've offered a raise

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,800
to whoever volunteers
to wear my mask that day.

116
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,600
And with Black Mask dead,

117
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,040
Gotham crowns Roman Sionis
as their white knight.

118
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,840
City is mine.

119
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,280
I'm the establishment.
I'm the system.

120
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,400
I'm the invulnerable ruler,

121
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,920
and anyone who tries to stop me

122
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,960
gets to meet you.

123
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,080
And they wonder why we test
our products on animals first!

124
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,920
Get rid of him.

125
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Still...

126
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,600
Begs the question...

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,000
How does one become invincible?

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,800
<i>It's the Channel 64
Gotham Live logo. Over.</i>

129
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,240
Wait, how did you get online?

130
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,440
"How'd you get online? Over".
We can't talk on top of each other.

131
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,880
Whatever. Over.

132
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,320
Turns out I should have explored
my dad's old workshop sooner.

133
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,640
I found a bunch of old city almanacs
and I matched the letters you found

134
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,800
in Black Mask's reflection
to the old Gotham Live logo.

135
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,400
5566 Olive.

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,200
<i>Hope you can read a map. Over.</i>

137
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,200
We'll radio when we get there.

138
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,680
Didn't realize this was a date.

139
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,880
Bitch shot me with a crossbow
while I was trapped in an elevator.

140
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,760
Yeah, and she beat my
ass twice and I wasn't.

141
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,640
Sophie, Circe is stronger
and she's ruthless.

142
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,880
And you're Batwoman.

143
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
Am I?

144
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,200
Without the suit,
the gadgets, the symbol,

145
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,120
- I'm just Ryan Wilder.
- Damn right you're Ryan Wilder

146
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,640
and this chick's about
to learn that the hard way.

147
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Where's Kate?

148
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,240
What are you doing in my loft?

149
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,200
I'm sorry, your loft?

150
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,920
You took her bedroom, too?

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,400
Kate's not Kate, Circe played us.

152
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,880
- I know, Safiyah told me.
- Wait Safiyah's still in Gotham.

153
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,320
She's not gonna be a problem

154
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,880
unless of course
you're rooting around

155
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,040
the east side scrapyard looking
to strip an '86 Firebird for parts.

156
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,480
Ryan, you take the guy in the car.

157
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
It's Mayor Akins.

158
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,680
Hey. Hey, Mayor. Stay with me.

159
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,240
- Stay with me, come on.
- You can't let them take our city.

160
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,560
You got to hold on, okay?

161
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,120
Here, emergencies are channel nine.
Keep trying till you get through.

162
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,320
- Wait, where the hell are you going?
- I know how to beat Circe.

163
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,200
- Ryan, I need to go with you.
- He needs you here now.

164
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,720
Remember when you
needed someone to stand behind

165
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
so False Face's
bullets didn't hit you?

166
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,000
Time to return the favor.

167
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,800
We infiltrate Black Mask's hideout
and we pull Kate out together.

168
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,680
Let me guess.
You don't feel confident

169
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,080
fighting without your supersuit
and don't want to risk Soph's life,

170
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,320
so I'm her crash test dummy?

171
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,920
Take the mask, Alice.

172
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,120
Just say the magic words.

173
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,600
I need you, okay?

174
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
I know.

175
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Dad...

176
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,920
What were you up to?

177
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,360
We need oxygen!

178
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,960
Let's get that door open hurry up.

179
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,120
You've got to be kidding me.

180
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,160
- You know him?
- Unfortunately.

181
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,520
Someone found him in a dumpster.

182
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,560
Checked his heart in the alley.
No idea how he's not dead.

183
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't believe we're wasting
oxygen on this guy.

184
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,360
I don't remember him being this huge.

185
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,520
That might have something
to do with whatever he mixed

186
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,880
with the Snakebite in his arm.

187
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,760
How'd he get Snakebite?
Batwoman shut down the manufacturer.

188
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,440
There shouldn't be
any left in the city.

189
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,000
Apparently he knows someone
who knows someone.

190
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Looks custom.

191
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,400
It's being atomized
through the respirator.

192
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,120
The vapors must be lessening the hit.

193
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,400
A longer high without ODing?

194
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,400
Don't want to leave.

195
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,600
Makes the memories last forever.

196
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,480
I got to go.

197
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,400
That makes sense now.

198
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Are you talking?

199
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,160
I just realized why your mail's
in my sister's loft.

200
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,720
You "live there" now.

201
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,960
You read my mail.

202
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,400
Relax.
It's just a super sexy power bill

203
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,280
postcard from Angelique
she sends her XOs...

204
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
Oh, and don't forget you have

205
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,600
a parole board
hearing tomorrow at 9.15am

206
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,560
They really let anyone be a superhero
these days, don't they?

207
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,760
Trust me, you're not
the only one in the car

208
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,040
shocked I've served
more time than you.

209
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,840
Oh, I'm serving my time, dear

210
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,720
just not in the traditional sense.

211
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,080
Remind me to get
the name of your lawyer.

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Safiyah's punishment is worse
than a stint at Blackgate.

213
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
By killing Ocean, she made
sure I would spend

214
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,720
the rest of my life
in agonizing grief.

215
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,920
She didn't let me say goodbye.

216
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,800
Okay. We're here.

217
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,320
I'm saying I get it.

218
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,920
I get why you hate me.

219
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Hey!

220
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,600
Hey! I said I'm sorry.

221
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
What do you want,

222
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,680
forgiveness
because you know what it feels like

223
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,080
to have the one person who cared
about you ripped from your life?

224
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,080
Get this through your head.

225
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,520
You don't deserve my forgiveness.

226
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,680
Why? Because you're the hero
and I'm the villain?

227
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,040
You're not a hero, Ryan,
but you already know that

228
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,640
which is why I'm here,
which is why you're so desperate

229
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,120
to get Kate back,
because your city is falling apart

230
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,480
- and you can't save it.
- Put on your mask.

231
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,320
What kind of hero kills
the first woman they've ever met?

232
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
What are you talking about?

233
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,120
Your biological mother
died in childbirth, right?

234
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,800
See, when a girl leaves me
at the whims

235
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,640
of a madman
with a fingernail extractor

236
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,640
my first task upon escaping is
to learn everything about her

237
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,040
and I know that your
first act on this earth

238
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,760
resulted in Mommy's death,
so if you want to point fingers

239
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,040
at who killed
the moms in your life...

240
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,880
We are gonna find Kate.

241
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,200
Then I'm gonna do
everything in my power

242
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,720
to dump your ass behind bars.

243
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,640
Mary to Luke.
I have a crazy idea, over.

244
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,440
- You need to lie down.
- Where is it?

245
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
- I don't know!
- Where is it?

246
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,960
I get that this is a hail Mary,
but we've exhausted every other idea

247
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,480
and an atomized dose of Snakebite

248
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,480
is way less dangerous
than the injectable

249
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,240
so we expose Kate to some vapors

250
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,480
it triggers a core memory
and we bring her back.

251
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,720
<i>- That is...</i>
- Insane? Over.

252
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,160
Luke? Did I lose you?

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,480
Luke, can you hear me?

254
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,240
<i>- Mary, do you copy?</i>
- Yes, yes, copy.

255
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,360
- So Snakebite yes or no?
<i>- I think it's brilliant.</i>

256
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,400
Oh, my god. Over.

257
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,920
<i>... for an evening of anarchy.</i>

258
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,240
<i>Help me raze every single one</i>

259
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,680
<i>of these moldering institutions
to their foundations.</i>

260
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,840
<i>I've dropped masks at
a dozen street corners.</i>

261
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,840
<i>Stand up, strap one on</i>

262
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,560
<i>become your own vigilante
and when the dust finally settles</i>

263
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,800
<i>over our failed system,</i>

264
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,760
<i>well, Black Mask
will still be standing</i>

265
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,560
<i>ready to lead you to your liberation...</i>

266
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,640
Well, this looks
like it's gonna end well.

267
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,040
He's experimenting.

268
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,720
Okay, we need
to get these out of here.

269
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Heads up!

270
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,520
You're gonna use my
own staff against me?

271
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,440
Is it really yours, though?

272
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,240
You were really gonna stab
your own sister in the back?

273
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,760
It's kind of our thing.

274
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,960
Thanks for once.

275
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,200
Get that stuff home and lock it up.

276
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,800
Follow her, I'll distract him.

277
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,960
- I can't beat her.
- And I can't drive the Batmobile.

278
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,560
Save my sister.

279
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,040
<i>The letter dropped off at multiple
news outlets around the city.</i>

280
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,960
<i>The letter from Batwoman
went on to say,</i>

281
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,280
<i>"Someone to prove
that there's something better</i>

282
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,600
<i>for us out there".</i>

283
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,680
<i>The crusader ended her
handwritten note with this...</i>

284
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,640
<i>"You've always needed a hero, Gotham</i>

285
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,200
<i>but in this moment,
maybe that's not me.</i>

286
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,200
<i>Maybe it's a job for all of you now
to trust what you know in your heart</i>

287
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,600
<i>to be right and good
and to find the courage</i>

288
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,240
<i>to use that feeling as
a uniting force against hate".</i>

289
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,720
- Guys, look.
- We're listening to Vesper.

290
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,840
No, seriously, look.

291
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,080
Is that one of those skull masks?

292
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,120
Why is that in this house?

293
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,920
Our neighbors put one
up in their window can we?

294
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,240
Well, I'll be damned.

295
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,400
You! Where's my Snakebite?

296
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,040
Come here! Where is it?

297
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,560
Give me your bag!

298
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,120
I'll give you the Snakebite.

299
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Here.

300
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,640
Back away, or neither of us get it.

301
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,600
Now you're just being an idiot.

302
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,480
Still working out the kinks.

303
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,400
What, what is happening?

304
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,040
This acts like an aerosol,
but it's still Snakebite,

305
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,840
so make sure you get
close but not so close

306
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,560
that you accidentally spray yourself.

307
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,360
Okay, you need to go.

308
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,920
I can't stop Circe.

309
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,320
- Ryan, yes, you can.
- I tried, Mary.

310
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,760
I can't, not without the suit.

311
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,480
They improvise so can you.

312
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Damn.

313
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,800
You don't need the suit
to be Batwoman.

314
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,640
She's already in you.

315
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
What the hell are you?

316
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Justice.

317
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,320
You want to know
why you failed as a villain?

318
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Yeah.

319
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
Please.

320
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
How did you know?

321
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,360
You can't be bad and have feelings.

322
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,640
You can't hate Batwoman
and protect her identity.

323
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,080
You can't hate your sister
and risk your life for her.

324
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
See, it's confusing. You can't
sell a confusing message.

325
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,240
Says the freak with two names.

326
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,080
Two names, one goal.

327
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,520
Black Mask terrifies the city.

328
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,680
Roman Sionis rescues it.

329
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,800
You know who was a great villain?

330
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
The Joker!

331
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,960
No!

332
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,640
- It won't come off!
- Good luck with your messaging.

333
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,400
<i>The Sionises
live at 2325 Finger Hill</i>

334
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,880
at least according to the Gotham
White Pages from five years ago.

335
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,480
Okay, I'm on 5th and Gray.

336
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,920
Copy. Trigate's the only
bridge out of the city

337
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,120
in that direction,
so if you turn left on Adams

338
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,160
and take riverside,
you might be able to cut her off.

339
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,880
I got eyes, thanks.

340
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Good luck.

341
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,720
Okay, so that's how you want to play?

342
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,760
Damn you can ride a bike.

343
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,840
All right, this bitch is crazy.

344
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,920
- Time to give up, Ryan.
- Call me Batwoman.

345
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Snakebite!

346
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
No!

347
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
What are you doing?

348
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,320
Tatiana's on her way here
to kill you. Get up!

349
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
I'd love to.

350
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,560
Unfortunately, I'm very distracted
renting us a camper at the moment.

351
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
I'm sorry.

352
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,440
Tatiana got the jump on you

353
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,480
because you were booking us
a vacation?

354
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,600
Not a vacation, Alice,

355
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,480
a new life

356
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,040
so you and I could disappear together
on the other side of the globe

357
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,240
get away from...

358
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
All of this.

359
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,640
Safiyah was right.

360
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,840
I was always gonna have
to choose one of you.

361
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,720
Since you wouldn't choose

362
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,320
Safiyah chose for you.

363
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,000
I thought this Snakebite high
was supposed to be fun.

364
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,760
I think you're missing the point.

365
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,800
This is my goodbye

366
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,920
but I don't... I don't want
to say good-bye to you.

367
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,760
Do me a favor, Alice.

368
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,240
You know this feeling that you feel?

369
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,040
and now that you know
you're capable of feeling it

370
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,880
chase it again.

371
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,560
So, you gonna say
goodbye to me or what?

372
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,800
Beth?

373
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,040
- Kate. Kate, wake up!
- Move, move, move.

374
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,680
One, two, three, four, five.

375
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,880
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Tilt her head back. Help me.

376
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,480
- What?
- She needs air.

377
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,560
What do I need to do?

378
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,080
So you're gonna use one
hand to pinch her nose

379
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,640
and the other to stabilize her head.
Start breathing.

380
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,840
- Nothing's happening.
- Again.

381
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,160
Don't die! Please don't die.

382
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,640
Hey. We got this, okay? Do it again.

383
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
Okay.

384
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,280
Don't leave me.

385
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Beth?

386
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,640
Over here! Found some people.

387
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,480
That's Alice from
the Wonderland Gang.

388
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,440
No! No! No! Can't leave!

389
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,360
No, no! No!

390
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,040
<i>Batwoman, if you're listening,</i>

391
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,240
<i>we got your memo
and challenge crushed.</i>

392
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,480
<i>Gotham rejected Black Mask's call</i>

393
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,120
<i>to overthrow
the government last night</i>

394
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,840
<i>and despite the citywide
power outage, sanity prevailed.</i>

395
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,480
<i>Word is leaders of both
the False Face Society</i>

396
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,080
<i>and the Wonderland Gang
are en route to Arkham</i>

397
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,640
<i>which just leaves one
last thing to reject...</i>

398
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,320
<i>your resignation letter, B-woman.</i>

399
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,080
<i>Come back to us, sister.</i>

400
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,280
<i>Gotham needs you
and more importantly</i>

401
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,880
<i>Gotham loves you.</i>

402
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,880
So, Ms. Wilder,
I see that you've been

403
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,880
out of Blackgate for 14 months
and that your P.O. has requested

404
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,280
that you be released
from restrictions early

405
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,320
so two questions for you.

406
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,680
Have you changed and how?

407
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,000
Have I changed?

408
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Honest answer...

409
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,080
No, I haven't changed.

410
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,080
I am still the good, caring,
intelligent human being

411
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,280
I was the day
I was wrongly arrested

412
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,000
and the day I met my cellmate

413
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,200
and the day I was dumped
before this board

414
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,080
and told I had a 75% chance
of being a repeat offender

415
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,920
but since I know this committee

416
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,840
wants to do the right thing today

417
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,240
allow me to give you
the answer you need.

418
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Yes...

419
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
I've changed.

420
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,320
I've changed because
I stopped seeing myself

421
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,040
the way you see me

422
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,000
and started seeing myself
for who I am

423
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,400
a woman who has found her power.

424
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,520
All in favor, raise your hand.

425
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,120
On behalf of the power invested in me
by the City of Gotham, I hereby deem

426
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,800
the supervision of the
parolee Ryan Wilder

427
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
unnecessary.

428
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,120
Ms. Wilder, you're hereby
released from parole.

429
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,280
Best of luck to you.

430
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,320
Okay. So then me
and Ryan are standing

431
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,280
on this pressure plate in the middle
of <i>Quiz Bowl</i>studios

432
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,640
having to answer all
of Cluemaster's questions

433
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,440
like we didn't have anything better
to do on a Friday night.

434
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
So, where were you?

435
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,320
Nerd flirting with a ginger cutie!

436
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,640
No, we were deciphering
a labyrinthine cryptogram

437
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,160
- to save your ass.
- Deciphering.

438
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,880
Anyway, Ryan zip lines us out
of there like a boss

439
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,160
and saves the day per usual.

440
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,120
Well, I'm glad to hear that
nothing's changed in Gotham

441
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,120
although a little birdy told me

442
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,760
that we have a plus-one
in the hero department.

443
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,720
Where did you find a supersuit?

444
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,760
Okay. So... when I was a kid

445
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,280
I drew pictures of how I imagined
a black Batman would look.

446
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,360
It turns out that my dad was secretly
turning those pictures into reality

447
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,240
but, like, today's not about me,
okay?

448
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,400
Kate, you're home

449
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,360
and you're safe and you're healthy

450
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,120
and Mary and I talked
about your future plans

451
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,720
and we support you.

452
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Thank you.

453
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,920
But million-dollar question.

454
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,800
How does Alice fit into those plans?

455
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,480
You know, I spent so long thinking

456
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,960
that it was up to me
to bring Beth out of Alice.

457
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Turns out Alice brought
Kate out of me.

458
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
She's my twin.

459
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,960
She'll always be a part of me

460
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,600
but until Alice wants to be Beth

461
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,640
I can't help her.

462
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Hey.

463
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,320
- Am I interrupting?
- Not at all.

464
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,760
We saved you vegan pizza.

465
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,920
Apparently you
and I have the same taste.

466
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,640
Understatement of the year.

467
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,440
- You guys mind if we have a minute?
- Yeah. Of course, of course.

468
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Kate.

469
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,120
It's really good to see you.

470
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,560
It's good to see you guys, too.

471
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,880
When did we get a Batmobile?

472
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,040
Sick, right? And just so you know

473
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,320
that was actually me
taking it easy on you, so...

474
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,000
- This is probably...
- So this is...

475
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,280
- Wait.
- Wait.

476
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,920
- You first.
- Okay.

477
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,520
I just want to say thank you.

478
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,120
That suit changed my life
in more ways than one

479
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,040
and it has been an honor

480
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,640
to be able to wear your symbol.

481
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,040
I put that suit on
to give back to my city.

482
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,600
You put it on to survive.

483
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,880
You know better than anyone

484
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,400
what that symbol means
to people who have no hope left.

485
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
Batwoman's yours, Ryan.

486
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,440
As for Mary and Luke...

487
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,920
They are my family

488
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,480
and I'm going to take care of them.

489
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
Thank you.

490
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,040
I hear you're not gonna
try to kill me this time.

491
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,320
True. I'm not gonna kill you,

492
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,120
but I can't promise that you're
not gonna want to kill me.

493
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,480
You're leaving Gotham.

494
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Of course you are.

495
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,560
First to see my dad
and then a friend in National City.

496
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,840
Then I'm off to find Bruce.

497
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Why Bruce?

498
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,480
My sister spent 11 years
waiting for me to find her

499
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
and I didn't.

500
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,840
If Bruce is alive
and trapped somewhere

501
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,480
maybe finding him is
the only way for me

502
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,560
to forgive myself
for not finding Beth.

503
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,240
None of that is your fault, Kate.

504
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,120
I wish that made me feel better.

505
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,520
So, you and me and timing?

506
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,080
Maybe in another universe,
we were meant to be together.

507
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,760
But in this one?

508
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,240
In this one

509
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,120
I think we both deserve
something a little easier.

510
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,840
Well, whoever that is for you,

511
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,160
I really hope for your sake...

512
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,760
that she can compete with this.

513
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,600
Well, last night proved
we made an impact on this city.

514
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,520
We're not just taking
bad off the streets.

515
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,000
- We're putting good back in.
- So what's next, Batwoman?

516
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,480
We find that case
of Batman trophies

517
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,480
before anyone else does
and from the sounds of it,

518
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,280
I am gonna have backup!

519
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,960
And now that your clinic is legit,

520
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,960
I was thinking what if
we build our community center

521
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,040
above it, make it an all-in-one
medical, mental health,

522
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,800
hangout for teens and you take point?

523
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,600
I'm so down with that.

524
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,520
Good, we start today.

525
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,560
And where are you going?

526
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,840
Just tying up a loose end.

527
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,760
<i>Janus! Janus!</i>

528
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,320
<i>Janus! Janus!</i>

529
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,640
Janus!

530
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,360
Kane, visitor.

531
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,800
- Make it quick.
- Not a problem.

532
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
Damn.

533
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,560
Security's worse than I thought.

534
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,440
I only gave him 40 bucks.

535
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,680
Well, here you have it...

536
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,160
Alice behind bars

537
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,240
the jumpsuit,
embarrassing lack of shoelaces

538
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,680
a neighbor who's crazier than me.

539
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,200
Is it everything you'd hoped for?

540
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,360
I just wanted the system
to work for once.

541
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,160
Right.

542
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,680
It finally did.
This is justice for my mom.

543
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,320
Just happy I got
to see it with my own eyes.

544
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,040
I hope we never see
each other again.

545
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,400
Funny you should mention
mothers actually.

546
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,200
You remind me almost daily
that your adoptive mother is dead

547
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,080
but maybe there's a little
wiggle room for bio mom.

548
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
What?

549
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,320
You don't know.

550
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,920
Well, maybe
it's time someone told you.

551
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,880
Your mother didn't die
in childbirth, Ry-Ry.

552
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,080
Mommy dearest
is still very much alive.
