1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,880
<i>Dear Kate, today's the day.
I'm supposed to die.</i>

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>Truth is I'm not scared of dying.
I'm scared I didn't live.</i>

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,040
<i>My mama always told me
I was put on this earth for a reason,</i>

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,280
<i>and now I finally know what that is.</i>

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,240
<i>Today is the day I kill you, Kate.</i>

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,720
<i>I spent 11 years waiting
for you to find me</i>

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,760
<i>but instead, I found you.</i>

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,240
<i>Then, I waited for you to save me</i>

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,120
<i>but instead, I saved you.</i>

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,360
<i>I turned you into a hero.</i>

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,240
<i>You helped me find my inner warrior
my voice, my power.</i>

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>While I played
the part of your villain</i>

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,160
<i>the girl who reminded you
how right and noble</i>

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,080
<i>and courageous you were.</i>

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
<i>You made me feel brave.</i>

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,960
<i>So I told you my greatest fear
was being locked away again,</i>

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,240
<i>and on that very day,
what did you do?</i>

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,120
<i>You helped me break
out of the system</i>

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,520
<i>that was trapping me.</i>

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,200
<i>You lured me into a box,
and you locked the door.</i>

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,160
<i>- I've come so far...
- I've come so far...</i>

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,760
<i>To get my revenge.</i>

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,320
<i>To inspire others</i>

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,080
<i>and I've survived much worse.</i>

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,040
<i>Cartwright, the queen of hearts...</i>

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,560
<i>Foster care, the candy lady.</i>

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,680
<i>If I could do that...</i>

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,800
<i>- I can do anything.
- I can do anything.</i>

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,200
<i>I can push off death another day
if it means saving you.</i>

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,640
<i>- I can even kill my sister.
- Hide it</i>

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,200
I'm the one who practices

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,800
{\an5}without a medical license
around here.

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,160
{\an5}- What are you doing?
- It is a combination

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
{\an5}of adrenaline and cortisone.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,000
{\an5}It will give me a jolt of energy

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,400
- and it will kill some of this pain.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,960
{\an5}- What are you doing?
- How did you even learn

38
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,160
- how to do this?
- YouTube.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,040
What?

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,800
{\an5}Did the YouTube medical expert

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,640
{\an5}also explain to you
that this combination

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,960
{\an5}will accelerate the speed
of cell decay by 300%?

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,760
{\an5}Without the shot,
you have days, and with it

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,280
you're lucky to have 24 hours.

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
{\an5}24 hours is all I need.

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,680
I put the tracker on Alice

47
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,480
{\an5}she probably made it
to Coryana by now.

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,360
{\an5}I will follow her route.

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,320
I will find Kate

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,680
{\an5}and I will get the Desert Rose
to heal myself.

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,120
{\an5}And if something goes wrong, you die.

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
Mary, look at me.

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm dead already.

54
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,120
{\an5}- Oh, my god.
- Oh, god.

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,560
{\an5}Fine. Team vote.

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,720
Where's Luke?

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,120
{\an5}Actually...

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,240
Mary, where's Luke?

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,400
{\an5}I have an active APB

60
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,280
and three field teams looking
for Alice

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
{\an5}yet you not only managed to locate her

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,720
{\an5}but tagged her
with a high-powered tracking device?

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
How?

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,720
{\an5}I'm sure you're familiar
with the concept

65
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,960
{\an5}don't ask, don't tell.

66
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,400
{\an5}Then I won't ask. I will state.

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,720
You're working with Batwoman.

68
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,280
So, why doesn't she track Alice?

69
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,480
{\an5}- Because she's sick.
- What do you mean sick?

70
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,640
She's dying.

71
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,080
{\an5}Long story short, Tommy Elliot
shot her with a poison bullet

72
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,360
{\an5}and there's no antidote.

73
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,320
{\an5}So we need you
to bring back a stem

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,200
{\an5}of the Desert Rose to heal her.

75
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Sorry to interrupt.

76
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,680
{\an5}Our APB for Alice and all
known associates turned up this.

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,720
Her friend Ocean boarded
a flight to Rome last night.

78
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Thanks.

79
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,080
{\an5}The deal Alice made with Safiyah

80
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,840
{\an5}was that she had to kill Ocean
to get Kate back.

81
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,360
{\an5}I doubt she showed up
to Coryana without him.

82
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,880
{\an5}But she is crazy enough
to show up with a fake him.

83
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,440
{\an5}It wouldn't be the first time
she slapped a face

84
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
{\an5}on somebody else's body.

85
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,800
God knows she fooled me
with the Bruce Wayne wannabe.

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,640
If that's true and Safiyah
believes the imposter,

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,480
then she hands Kate over to Alice,
and Alice kills her.

88
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,840
{\an5}Which means you need
to get going now.

89
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,560
<i>The tracker shows that Alice left
the Olsson airstrip and flew east.</i>

90
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,080
Sophie low-key slipped me the feed.

91
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,280
So, we're gonna gloss
over you telling

92
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
a Crow you're working with Batwoman?

93
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,760
It was preferable
to losing both batwomen

94
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
in one fell swoop.

95
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,600
Sophie said she would get a flower.

96
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,880
And you believe her?

97
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,160
Can we stay positive, please?

98
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,800
<i>We land, find my daughter, get out.</i>

99
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,880
- And I am screwed.
- <i>One more thing.</i>

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,520
We need to grab a Desert Rose
while we're there.

101
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,520
- What are you talking about?
- And I rest my case.

102
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,840
I'll explain en route,

103
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,640
but we're not leaving
that island without it.

104
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,080
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>Commander!</i>

105
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,440
- Wait. What the hell happened?
- They're Safiyah's men.

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,320
That would mean that Safiyah
knew they were coming.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
Oh, my god.
What just happened?

108
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
They're taking them somewhere.

109
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,520
Looks like they're heading
toward Olsson airstrip.

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,960
It's the same airfield
that Alice left from.

111
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,160
So, they're going
to Coryana?

112
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,560
I have no idea what they're doing.

113
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,400
Ryan, no!

114
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,320
You inject that, you die today.

115
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
We literally just watched

116
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
our last hope fizzle before our eyes.

117
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
Unless anyone else
has any more brilliant ideas.

118
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,760
Start the clock.

119
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,600
I am going to Coryana,

120
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,880
I am saving them, I am saving Kate,

121
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
and I'm saving my damn self.

122
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,600
I feel good. I'm sorry.
I haven't felt this good in months.

123
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,920
Okay. Easy there, tiger.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,040
The faster you work the adrenaline
through your system,

125
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,320
the faster it returns
to self-destruct mode.

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,360
24 hours was a guess, not a promise.

127
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,240
- Okay.
- Alice's transponder died

128
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,120
over this tiny section
of the mediterranean.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,160
But I don't see an island.

130
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,280
Yeah. That's the point.

131
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,040
It's rigged
to avoid satellite detection.

132
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,000
So if I had the only serum
on the planet

133
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,880
that could cure cancer
and wanted to cloak it

134
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,120
so nobody else could have it,

135
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,400
I would use anti-radar
electromagnetic waves.

136
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,040
So the cowl's lenses can detect
the electromagnetic field.

137
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,840
Consider it your bullseye.

138
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,400
- Bullseye for what?
- These are emp grenades.

139
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,280
So according to Sophie,
the only electricity

140
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,120
that she saw on the island was used
for electric wrist restraints.

141
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,920
So a few of these will knock out
the power for a few hours

142
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,800
and free anyone wearing them,

143
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,960
presumably Mary's dad,
Sophie, and Kate.

144
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,640
Okay. You didn't answer my question
about the bullseye.

145
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,760
I got to find you a ride.

146
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Okay.

147
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,080
Can I address
the elephant in the room?

148
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,880
You are not going to die.

149
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,960
Actually...

150
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,560
The elephant is if I live.

151
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,160
Say I find Kate
and I bring her back here.

152
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,200
Then what?
She's Batwoman, right?

153
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,600
What does that make me?

154
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,880
That's not gonna...

155
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
Kate would never push you out
like that.

156
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,480
So, then there's two Batwomen?

157
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
Because that's not confusing.

158
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,320
Look, I don't know
what happens

159
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,800
when Kate comes back.

160
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,680
All I know is that I...

161
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,480
I really, really want her back.

162
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,440
I know.

163
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,320
But...

164
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,720
If I do die...

165
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,480
You're in charge of my baby.

166
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,400
No, no, no.

167
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,640
That's not me.

168
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Yes.

169
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,440
Angelique gave her to me,
and I was gonna give her to my mom

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
when we moved into our place.

171
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,080
She's all I have left of her.

172
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,840
Well, then it's official.

173
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,920
You definitely have to make it back
because I couldn't even keep

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,280
my tamagotchi alive for five minutes,

175
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,920
so...

176
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,400
I think I just found you a ride.

177
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,840
Okay. And?

178
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,520
Let's just say I couldn't order you
the vegan option.

179
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,080
You couldn't even afford coach?

180
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,240
We're just lucky this mail carrier's

181
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,400
gonna fly within five minutes
of Coryana's airspace.

182
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,840
- Clock's ticking.
- Yeah. 18 hours to live.

183
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,080
- I got it.
- No. I mean,

184
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,640
you're about 25 minutes
from the drop.

185
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
The what now?

186
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
I can override the door sensor

187
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,680
and buy you a 30-second window
for the halo jump.

188
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,120
What, what the hell is a halo jump?

189
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,320
High altitude, low opening.
You asked about the bullseye.

190
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,440
You need to hit a tiny target
from 33,000 feet.

191
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,280
Yeah, yeah.
This would be a lot easier

192
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
if we had a batplane.

193
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
That's what I've been saying.

194
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,240
Okay. I'll get right on
that after I work out

195
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,360
the kinks in the batsub.

196
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,520
Don't deploy your cute
until your heads-up display

197
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,240
reads 3,500 feet
so you avoid detection.

198
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
Oh, and use your pressure mask.

199
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,920
Otherwise, you'll die instantly.

200
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,520
Is this a bad time to say
I have never been on a plane before?

201
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,720
Tatiana informed me the two of you
had a little chat.

202
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Of course she did.

203
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,520
That she told you how you
and Ocean fell in love

204
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,600
how he stole a Desert Rose

205
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,120
and how he convinced
you to leave Coryana with him.

206
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,240
That was the gist of it

207
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,760
less a few juicy details
about how he wasn't

208
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,600
the only islander who loved me.

209
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,800
I want to be clear about something.

210
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,520
I considered Ocean a brother.

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,080
I had you both erased
from each other because I...

212
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,480
Believed you were
a bad influence on him.

213
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,360
Got it.

214
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,560
A ruler doesn't get to play
by the whims of her emotions, Alice.

215
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,920
Nor can she afford to be blind
to what's right in front of her.

216
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,480
You've disappointed me.

217
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,600
I brought you your brother

218
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,240
with your fancy knife
through his chest.

219
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,480
Now, give me my sister
so I can put one through hers.

220
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,880
You foolish girl.

221
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,640
My men found a tracker on your boot.

222
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,040
You were being followed.

223
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
You okay?

224
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,760
I think so.

225
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,720
Where the hell are we?

226
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,280
Exactly where you wanted to be.

227
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,400
Not how you saw this going?

228
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,280
Are you kidding me right now?

229
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,360
There's nothing down there!

230
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,520
Yes, there is,
and you're gonna miss it.

231
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,040
- You need to jump.
- Well, that's easy for you to say.

232
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,600
What if my chute doesn't open?

233
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,840
It will! Ryan, hurry up!
If you miss your window,

234
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,040
you're gonna end up
in the middle of the Ocean,

235
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
and there's no shark repellant
on the utility belt.

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,560
- Well, why not?
- Because that's stupid. Now, go!

237
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,560
Okay. Okay. You got this.
You got this! Come on!

238
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,920
Let's go!

239
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,880
- There it is.
- I can't watch.

240
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,720
<i>You're breaking through
the electromagnetic shield.</i>

241
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,480
Okay.
I see two unique heat signatures.

242
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,040
They could be restraints.
Deploy your chute and the EMPs.

243
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,800
Why are we here?

244
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,960
You're here
because Alice wants you to have

245
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,880
a front row seat
to watch her kill Kate.

246
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,480
She's here at Safiyah's request.

247
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,920
Me? What did I do?

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,480
It's not what you did.

249
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,080
It's what Safiyah
thinks you're capable of.

250
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,840
You're skilled, strong,
and most of all, loyal.

251
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,800
She wants you to join her army.

252
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,960
Why the hell would I join
an army of ruthless killers?

253
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,440
Because you're already a part of one.

254
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
His.

255
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,080
Both groups are organized, armed,
and dangerous,

256
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,200
but we are committed
to protecting our people

257
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,440
while you oppress yours.

258
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,800
Touchdown. I made it.

259
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Sort of.

260
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,880
See? That wasn't so bad.

261
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,360
Oh, yeah.
You owe me a spa day.

262
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,680
Just remember
to conserve your energy

263
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,240
or your vitals will drop again.

264
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,840
You seeing this?

265
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,920
That must be the Desert Rose.

266
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,880
I've never seen anything
more beautiful in my life.

267
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,520
Ryan?

268
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,960
- Crap.
- Ryan?

269
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,440
Hello? Can you hear me?

270
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,440
The EMPs must have
knocked out the comms.

271
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,600
Hey. I'm Batwoman.

272
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,800
Is your queen chick available?

273
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
We're really doing this?

274
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Oh, boy.

275
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,960
I expected this to feel different.

276
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,080
I'm sure
you can ask your gal pal enigma

277
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,600
to root around your head
and fix it for you.

278
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Now, give me Kate.

279
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,000
You don't even know
why you want to kill her.

280
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,880
She betrayed me.

281
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,240
That's what you keep
telling yourself,

282
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,640
but maybe deep down
in the dangerous musings of your ID

283
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,160
there's a compulsion to kill her
because she's more loved than you

284
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,560
and if you kill her

285
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,200
as irrational as it sounds

286
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,840
you think that love
will transfer to you.

287
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,360
But that's not how it works

288
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,120
so the conscious part
of you uses feelings

289
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,440
like pain and hurt
and betrayal to justify it

290
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,160
but what happens
to all those messy feelings

291
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
when Kate's dead

292
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
and everyone still hates you?

293
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,440
You are not changing my mind.

294
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,400
I have fantasized
about killing my sister

295
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,080
since she locked me in Arkham.

296
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,880
I know
we've had our differences, Alice

297
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,000
but I do care about you.

298
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,800
I just need to know
this is what you want more

299
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
than anything.

300
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,560
More than the air I breathe.

301
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,760
As you wish.

302
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,720
I will take you to her.

303
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,200
If I had a nickel
for every bad penny.

304
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,160
Batwoman?

305
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,000
What brings you here?

306
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,320
We believe she was trying
to help our prisoners escape.

307
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
They're gone.

308
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,480
Is everything all right?

309
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,800
It will be...

310
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,920
Because you're gonna help me

311
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,640
and in return,
I'm gonna tell you something

312
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,040
you're gonna want to hear.

313
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
I see.

314
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,440
Unfortunately, I don't barter
with uninvited guests.

315
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,640
So if you'll excuse us

316
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,120
we were in the middle of something.

317
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,920
You sure that's your boy over there?

318
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,680
You might want
to look a little harder.

319
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,640
Enough with all these distractions.

320
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,600
I gave you Ocean,
and now you can give me Kate.

321
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,920
My queen

322
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,920
I had no idea.

323
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,720
That was clearly her intention.

324
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,360
Who is this?

325
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
A nobody.

326
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,840
Well, a, a body.

327
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,480
Just one the morgue wouldn't miss.

328
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,000
You still have feelings for him
don't you?

329
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,560
Put her with the bat

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,560
and find me Ocean.

331
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,440
- What the hell's this?
- Batwoman.

332
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,960
Looks like an emp blocker.

333
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
Probably how the cuffs disarmed.

334
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,960
I thought she was sick.

335
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,280
Didn't know you had
an in with Batwoman's doctor.

336
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,040
That Desert Rose
I need to snag, it's for her.

337
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,480
You working with her?

338
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,080
I'm not working with her.
I'm just not working against her.

339
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,320
Who is she?

340
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,720
Honestly, I have no idea.

341
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,280
I don't, sir, but she's been trying
to help us to find Kate

342
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,720
who obviously inspired her to risk

343
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,840
her life for total strangers.

344
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,520
I don't see the harm
in us teaming up.

345
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,400
Except the Crows and Batwoman abide

346
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,360
by two very different ideologies.

347
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,520
Because we're held accountable
for our actions

348
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,640
and she's not?

349
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,640
If that were actually true,

350
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,440
those agents
who plowed down wolf spider

351
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,560
on that tarmac the other night

352
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,440
wouldn't have just been fired.
They'd be in jail.

353
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,320
Now, you sound like one
of Safiyah's lackeys.

354
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,000
You know I love my job, sir,

355
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,360
but I think it's time
we stop pretending

356
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,040
we're not above the law.

357
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,480
What's that smell?

358
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
Ammonium nitrate.

359
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,520
As in the bomb-making chemical?

360
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,720
That's one use for it.

361
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,360
Also makes
a very effective fertilizer.

362
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,880
- To grow the Desert Rose.
- Come on.

363
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,280
Kate's got to be around
her somewhere.

364
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,320
I was wondering
how this place could suck harder.

365
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,480
Why are you even here?

366
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,200
To stop you from killing Kate.

367
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,120
I don't know what this obsession
is with my sister,

368
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,720
but you're not part
of our family soap, okay?

369
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,080
I see.

370
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,160
You're on your way out.

371
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,760
You've got a few hours left to live,
and you need Kate to tap back in

372
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,440
because god forbid
the bat ears go unoccupied

373
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,560
for five minutes.

374
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,160
So, people like you
can roam free and kill

375
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,600
their own siblings?

376
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,440
Not to play Monday morning
quarterback

377
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,640
but if you didn't want me
to kill Kate

378
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,440
you should have stopped me
when you had the chance.

379
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,240
Then I wouldn't have been able
to follow your dumb ass

380
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,120
to this godforsaken island.

381
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,960
The tracker was you.

382
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,160
Clever girl.

383
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
That's it?

384
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,680
I just royally screwed up a move
you've been planning for months.

385
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,720
You could end me right now,
but you just hit me with a loud sigh.

386
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,240
You're already on death's door.

387
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,400
- Let's let nature run its course.
- Or maybe you're terrified.

388
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,760
- Of killing a sky rat?
- Of killing your sister.

389
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,160
You've been throwing
the same tantrum for months

390
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,160
poisoning bats,
attacking Gotham square

391
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,960
killing, god knows, how many people

392
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,680
because if Kate was gonna die

393
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,400
she was gonna die your way

394
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,040
and here you are moments away
from getting what you want

395
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,760
except, it's not actually
what you want, is it?

396
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,480
You don't want Kate back to kill her.

397
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,000
You just want her back.

398
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,920
Well, someone has spent
an awful lot of time thinking

399
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,440
about the girl they blame
for their mom's death.

400
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,760
You remember what you said
to me on your way out?

401
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,960
You said...

402
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,760
"It's not my fault,"

403
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,600
but you weren't talking
about killing my mom.

404
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,120
You were talking about why you are
the way you are

405
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,800
because as dark
and screwed up as you are

406
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,120
at the end of the day

407
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,280
you're a victim of somebody too.

408
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,280
And that tiny sliver of humanity
won't let you kill your sister

409
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,360
because then it is your fault.

410
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,400
If you want Kate, she's yours.

411
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,400
You've traveled too far
to leave empty-handed.

412
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,720
When someone does me a favor
I always react in kind.

413
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,360
What would you like
in return for helping me?

414
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,960
I've been poisoned.

415
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,600
I want enough Desert Rose
to cure myself.

416
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
So be it.

417
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,360
And I want to take Kate Kane
back to Gotham...

418
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Alive.

419
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,840
You gave me one thing.

420
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,520
In fairness,
I'm offering you the same.

421
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,360
The flower or the girl...

422
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,400
Choose one.

423
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,520
The flower.

424
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,760
Done.

425
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,880
I suppose that leaves Kate for you.

426
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,080
Enough with the games.
Where is she?

427
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,000
I will bring you to her...

428
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,280
once you've fulfilled
your end of the deal.

429
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,080
What is this?

430
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,560
It's your second chance.

431
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,440
If you want Kate,
you're going to kill him

432
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
the real him.

433
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,960
Did you do this?

434
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,000
I didn't tell her anything.

435
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,520
She didn't have to.

436
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,360
We confiscated her phone

437
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,520
found a search for a charming,
little Shantytown

438
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,920
in Portofino, and there you were.

439
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,760
Isn't that precious?

440
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,800
She was going to come find you.

441
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,120
I always wanted to see
their piazzetta.

442
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,080
Such a sweet, little love story
that ends today.

443
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,720
I gave Batwoman a choice,

444
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,240
and now I'll do the same for you.

445
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,440
You can have one...

446
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,240
Ocean or Kate.

447
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,840
You're supposed to be watching
for the feed to come back online.

448
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,280
I am. It's not.

449
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,800
Mary, it's a plant.

450
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,680
It's Ryan's plant

451
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,440
something she's managed
to keep alive

452
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,800
through her mother's death

453
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,640
through a prison sentence
she doesn't deserve

454
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,360
through a fake Bruce Wayne
trying to kill her

455
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,640
and now she's off saving
Kate just so we can do what

456
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,640
- show her the door?
- Getting both Kate and Ryan back

457
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,880
would be a great problem to have

458
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,080
mostly because it would mean
they survived

459
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,320
this Hail Mary of a plan.

460
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,200
Then keeping this alive is literally
the least I can do.

461
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Oh, my god.

462
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,640
You're one of Safiyah's many arms.

463
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,920
Our queen doesn't like
to be followed.

464
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Hey!

465
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,000
Okay. Okay.

466
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,800
The elevator to the cave is out,
so we got to take the stairs.

467
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,560
- Wait, wait, wait. Ryan's plant.
- What about it?

468
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,760
I can't leave it.

469
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,200
We can grab it later.

470
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,560
Hey. You want
to send her a picture,

471
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,200
ask her if she thinks
we're doing a good job?

472
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,080
Ryan would want us to run away
from a trained assassin.

473
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,440
She asked me for one thing, Luke.

474
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,600
Okay. Okay. Fine, Mary.
Just grab the damn thing.

475
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Fine!

476
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,800
Want to rock, paper, scissors it?

477
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
No!

478
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,480
What is this even about?

479
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,480
Some B.S. Frame job?

480
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,320
You made her believe
I killed off her little gang

481
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,000
and blew up her sister's plane.

482
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,280
Why would I stir things
up between you two?

483
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
Your little brain wipe worked.

484
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,160
I didn't even know Alice existed
until a few weeks ago.

485
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,240
Tell her.

486
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,920
Tell her, Alice. It was someone else.
I didn't frame Safiyah.

487
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,720
Give me the knife.

488
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,080
This was never
about someone setting you up.

489
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,200
This was about Alice caring about me
more than she cared about you

490
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,400
and your inability to live with it.

491
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Kill him,
and you can have your sister.

492
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Is it worth it,

493
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,760
killing me just to kill Kate?

494
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,520
If you really want to punish her,
leave her here to rot.

495
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm sorry, Ocean...

496
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,160
But I don't want to kill her anymore.

497
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,360
Now, bring me to Kate...

498
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Before anyone else
on this island dies.

499
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,800
- What are you doing?
- She's bleeding all over

500
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,920
the damn plant.

501
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,560
Hey. Mary!

502
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,720
You lift, I grab.

503
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,600
- Come on.
- Okay.

504
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,040
Okay. Grab it, grab it.

505
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,120
- Run!
- Run!

506
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,720
<i>Oi, oi.</i>What's the rush?

507
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,880
- Julia, when did you get back?
- Who the bloody hell is that?

508
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Okay.

509
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,600
Where's Safiyah?

510
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,760
She said
she would bring me a Desert Rose.

511
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
She will...

512
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,800
Once she's finished with Alice.

513
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,560
It's finally time for Alice
to be reunited with her sister.

514
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,240
Someone care to explain
why I had to dagger

515
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,600
one of Safiyah's minions?

516
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,520
The many arms found out
we tracked Alice to Coryana.

517
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,920
Courtesy of Batwoman,
who followed her there

518
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
to find Kate.

519
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Got it.

520
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,760
That's actually why I'm here.

521
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,720
I have to applaud you

522
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,320
for picking your own survival
over Kate's.

523
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,560
Take it from an island lifer...

524
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,240
Self-sacrifice is overrated.

525
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,160
That's not why I did it.

526
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,240
Alice isn't going to kill her sister.

527
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,240
I'm curious how you know that.

528
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,720
I saw it in her face.

529
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,000
Revenge,

530
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,120
hate, anger, the...

531
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,440
Those are the only emotions
she knows,

532
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,920
so she hides behind them.

533
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,720
Well, you're right about one thing.

534
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Alice
isn't going to kill her sister today.

535
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,960
Kate?

536
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Where's Kate?

537
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
What is this?

538
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,440
What did you do?

539
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,600
I hired a team to run down some leads
from the tip line.

540
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,120
We found...

541
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,160
Body parts
off the coast of Bludhaven.

542
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,400
Must have got caught
in the currents.

543
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,560
What do...
what do you mean body parts?

544
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,040
They ran the DNA.

545
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,880
No.

546
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,440
- No.
- Where is she?

547
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,120
Where is my sister?

548
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,960
I never had your sister, Alice.

549
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,600
The DNA was hers. It was Kate's.

550
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,360
I'm so sorry.

551
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,160
Kate's dead.

552
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,800
No! No!

553
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,800
No! No!

554
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,080
Get her out of here.

555
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,920
No! Kate! No! No!

556
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,720
Let me go!

557
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,440
You blew up her plane!

558
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,920
You killed her,
you stupid, lying bitch!

559
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,080
I had nothing to do with her plane

560
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,320
but when someone tried to frame me
for killing your sister

561
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
I saw an opportunity
to get what I wanted

562
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,280
to make you
and Ocean pay for your betrayal.

563
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,440
- You are a monster!
- And I created you

564
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,480
so what does that make you?

565
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,440
- Get her off my island.
- No. No! No!

566
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,520
Are you seeing this?

567
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,360
This is gonna get us out of here.

568
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,960
- You know, how to fly?
- Used to.

569
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,680
I'll get this running.

570
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,640
I'll keep looking for Kate.

571
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,840
Give me an hour. Just...

572
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,240
- If we're not back...
- I'll find you. Go.

573
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,560
Well done, my queen.

574
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,680
This should serve
as a lesson to anyone

575
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,320
who decides to betray you.

576
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,800
What the hell is happening?
He was dead.

577
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,080
When the blade was molded

578
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,240
its molten was imbued
with the Desert Rose.

579
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,840
Its curative properties
sealed Ocean's arteries

580
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,040
upon its entrance.

581
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,520
Welcome back, brother.

582
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,560
That breath in your chest
is only there because of me.

583
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,840
I gave you your life back.

584
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
Why would you do this to me?

585
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,960
When push comes to shove,

586
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,840
Alice doesn't actually have feelings
for you.

587
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,640
I wanted you to see that.

588
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,120
You're sick.

589
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,440
I'm not the one who just put a knife
through your heart.

590
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,880
Alice's loyalty will always lie
with her sister

591
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,360
just as yours should lie with me

592
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,080
because loyalty is everything to me.

593
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,360
Isn't that right, Tatiana?

594
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,920
It is, my queen.

595
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,360
Then why test it?

596
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,600
Why after I gave you power
and freedom and health

597
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,680
would you pick a fight with Alice
on my behalf?

598
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,240
- Safiyah, I don't know what...
- You slaughtered Alice's gang.

599
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,240
You sent her a note
saying I killed Kate.

600
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,240
You reeled her back into my life.

601
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Why when you know
how hard I worked to forget her?

602
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,000
But you never forgot her.

603
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,720
That's the problem.

604
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
You couldn't.

605
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,120
You were in love.

606
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,240
I was trying to get rid
of that toxic an...

607
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,400
Enough!

608
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,520
You always hated Alice and tried
to drive a wedge between us.

609
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,600
That's how I knew it was you.

610
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
No.

611
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,720
-No.
-You wanted to see her lose

612
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,160
and now you have.

613
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,880
Congratulations, Tatiana.

614
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,920
I hope you were entertained.

615
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,840
Keep that in her.

616
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,560
I'll pull it out
when I decide to forgive her.

617
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,440
Now, we both have nothing.

618
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,360
What's happening?

619
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,280
My roses!

620
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,960
Oh, my god.

621
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
It's too late.

622
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,000
You are here.

623
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,800
Are you okay?

624
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,920
Did you get a Desert Rose?

625
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,400
I was wondering
why my guard left his post.

626
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,680
Looks like it wasn't meant to be.

627
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,000
We need to find Kate
and get the hell out of here.

628
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,280
Kate's not here.

629
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,880
What do you mean Kate's not here?

630
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
I mean,

631
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,440
Safiyah lied.

632
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,240
Tatiana told me Kate
was never on this island.

633
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,280
Kate died in the plane crash.

634
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,880
This can't be real.

635
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,520
I don't want to believe it either.

636
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,880
The feed's back on.

637
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,560
Is that the Desert Rose?

638
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,960
Bloody hell. It's ashes.

639
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,080
Oh, this isn't happening.
We needed that.

640
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,640
Ryan needed that to live.

641
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,680
Oh, my god.

642
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,480
The commander thinks
he can hotwire the plane.

643
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,680
We need to go.

644
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,160
I'm not gonna make it.

645
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,200
You don't know that.

646
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,080
I've only got a few hours.

647
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,280
There's nothing there for me.

648
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,600
Will you sit with me?

649
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,600
Please.

650
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,160
I don't want to die alone.

651
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,400
I'm sorry we got off
on the wrong foot.

652
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,120
You didn't deserve that.

653
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,000
It's because I wasn't Kate.

654
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Hello?

655
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,440
Sophie, can you hear me?

656
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,040
How is my phone suddenly working?

657
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,720
The EMPs that knocked out
the power must have expired,

658
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,440
but I couldn't flag Batwoman
on the comms.

659
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I'm with her now.

660
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,320
You need to get her back to Gotham.

661
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,200
She doesn't want to leave.

662
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,680
Tell her to get her ass
back here now.

663
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
I have a cure.

664
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,800
<i>It's our birthstone.
Red is a very symbolic color.</i>

665
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,760
<i>Let's take a picture, Beth.
Make sure our necklaces are in it.</i>

666
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,720
<i>Ready? Cheese.</i>
