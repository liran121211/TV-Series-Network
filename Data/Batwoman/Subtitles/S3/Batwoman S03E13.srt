00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:02,828
PREVIOUSLY ON "BATWOMAN"...

2
00:00:02,872 --> 00:00:03,829
MARQUIS IS SICK.

3
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:05,831
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT.

4
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,964
THE JOKER PRESSED
THIS GODFORSAKEN THING

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,053
TO MY SON'S HEAD AND
TURNED HIM INTO A MONSTER.

6
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:12,316
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT
ANOTHER BUZZ COULD CURE HIM.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,753
I AM LOSING MY MIND!

8
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:16,277
THE HALLUCINATIONS
ARE BACK.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,800
I JUST NEED
A LITTLE EDGER

10
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:19,243
UNTIL YOU CAN GET
ME THE JOY BUZZER.

11
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,542
THERE'S ONLY ONE BUZZ LEFT.

12
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:24,459
RYAN NEEDS IT...
FOR HER BROTHER.

13
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:26,200
YOUR DAD PROGRAMMED
YOUR SUIT'S AI

14
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:27,984
TO SPEAK
WITH HIS VOICE?

15
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,725
DAD, SAY HELLO
TO MARY.

16
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:31,205
HELLO, MARY.

17
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,207
IT'S LIKE YOU CAN
TALK TO HIM AGAIN.

18
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,819
IT SEEMS BATWOMAN IS
A NO-SHOW.

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,041
MY GOD. THAT'S WHY
BATWOMAN DIDN'T SHOW UP.

20
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,086
SHE WAS HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

21
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,349
I'M SORRY, MARY.

22
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:47,003
WHAT DID YOU DO?

23
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,005
WHAT IF I WERE
TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING

24
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,399
THAT WOULD MAKE
THE JOKER...

25
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:53,227
WISH HE WERE YOU?

26
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,706

AND I FOUND A PLACE.

56
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:48,532
IT'S IN SWITZERLAND,
IT'S NEAR GENEVA,

57
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:51,405
AND IT'S CALLED THE WEISSE
KANINCHEN SANATORIUM.

58
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,972
THEY SPECIALIZE
IN CHILDHOOD TRAUMA.

59
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:57,367
THEY CAN HELP YOU.

60
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,026
NO.

61
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:07,595
NO MORE CELLS.

62
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:13,035
NO MORE INSTITUTIONS.

63
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,300
I CANNOT BE
IN MY HEAD ANYMORE!

64
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,346
I WANT OUT!

65
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,393
PLEASE GET ME OUT.

66
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:27,310
PLEASE, PLEASE.

67
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:32,750
I CAN'T.

68
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:34,622
PLEASE!

69
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:39,017
ALL RIGHT, BATWOMAN.
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

70
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:40,671
HOW DO WE BEST HANDLE
OUR ONE WILD

71
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:42,238
AND PRECIOUS BUZZ?

72
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,022
MARQUIS SHOWED US
HE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS

73
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,763
TO A SLIVER OF HUMANITY,

74
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,504
AND THANKS TO, ALICE,
HE JUST GOT CONTROL

75
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:49,245
OF THE BATCAVE,

76
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,726
SO HOWEVER WE GET HIM,
IT'S GOT TO BE TODAY,

77
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:55,207
AND IF THIS THING ONLY
HAS JUICE FOR ONE BUZZ,

78
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:57,732
I HAVE TO BE THE ONE
TO MAKE THE PLAY.

79
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,473
SO WE LURE HIM CLOSE,

80
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,866
AND I HIT HIM BEFORE HE
KNOWS WHAT'S COMING.

81
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,304
OR ALTERNATIVELY,
WE GIVE IT TO ALICE.

82
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,959
SORRY I'M LATE.

83
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:09,328
YOU KNOW SHE JUST GAVE
MARQUIS THE KEYS

84
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:11,311
TO THE BATKINGDOM,
RIGHT?

85
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:12,660
I JUST CAME BACK
FROM ARKHAM,

86
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,357
WHERE I FOUND HER
PLAYING DIY

87
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:17,012
ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY
WITH A SOCKET WRENCH.

88
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:20,581
SHE'S NOT GONNA SURVIVE
HER NEXT PSYCHOLOGICAL BREAK.

89
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,583
WE TRIED TO HELP HER.

90
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,149
ALICE MADE HER BED.

91
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,978
OK, MARY.

92
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:29,807
WE KNOW YOU FEEL
A CERTAIN... WHATEVER

93
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:33,811
FOR HER,
BUT THE BUZZER CREATED MARQUIS.

94
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,552
THE JOKER CREATED
MARQUIS,

95
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,032
AND IF WE'RE
SPLITTING HAIRS,

96
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,555
HE CREATED ALICE,
TOO.

97
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:41,341
ALICE KILLED
YOUR MOM, MARY.

98
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,908
DO YOU THINK
I FORGOT?

99
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,607
YOU THINK I DON'T
KNOW HOW BADLY

100
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,913
RYAN WANTS
HER BROTHER BACK

101
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:51,351
OR THAT THE FIRST TIME
ALICE EVER MET SOPHIE

102
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,353
SHE THREW HER OFF
A 30-STORY BUILDING?

103
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:56,530
I KNOW. IT IS NOT
LIKE THIS IS

104
00:05:56,573 --> 00:06:02,057
SOME EASY DECISION
FOR ME... OR ANYONE,

105
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,757
BUT I BELIEVE ALICE
IS CAPABLE OF CHANGE.

106
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,629
SHE JUST NEEDS
A CHANCE.

107
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:17,812
COME ON. EACH ONE OF
YOU LOOKED ME IN THE EYE

108
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,118
A FEW WEEKS AGO,
APOLOGIZED

109
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:22,425
FOR SIDELINING ME,
AND ASSURED ME

110
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,471
I WOULD HAVE A VOICE
ON THIS TEAM.

111
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:28,866
THIS IS IT.

112
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,521
THIS IS ME USING
MY VOICE.

113
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:36,787
THIS IS... THIS IS
WHAT I WANT.

114
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:40,487
I NEED TO SAVE
ALICE'S LIFE.

115
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:49,321
I JUST GOT A LIVE URGENT
MESSAGE FROM MARQUIS JET.

116
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:50,497
YEAH, ME, TOO.

117
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,369
I THINK
WE ALL DID.

118
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,154
WHAT'S UP, GOTHAM CITY?
WE HAVING FUN YET?

119
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:57,765
MARQUIS JET HOLLERIN' AT YOU

120
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,636
FROM A TOP-SECRET LOCATION.

121
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,073
THE TIME HAS COME,
THE DAY IS HERE.

122
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:04,249
TONIGHT IS THE DAMN NIGHT.

123
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,469
I NEED EVERYONE
TO TAKE TO THE STREETS,

124
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,602
GET OUT ON YOUR BALCONIES,
JUMP UP ON YOUR CAR.

125
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:10,125
HELL, CLIMB UP
TO THE TIPPY TOP

126
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,692
OF YOUR CORNER CHURCH STEEPLE

127
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,868
BECAUSE IN 5 HOURS
ON THE DOT...

128
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:18,176
I'M GONNA BE SHOUTING
BATWOMAN'S TRUE IDENTITY

129
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,874
FROM THE ROOFTOPS.

130
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:23,573
SPOILER ALERT!

131
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,880
SHE'S NOT THE HERO
YOU THINK SHE IS.

132
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:28,012
TICKTOCK, GOTHAM.

133
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,843
THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.

134
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:36,456
MARQUIS JET IS ABOUT TO
SHUT BATWOMAN DOWN FOR GOOD.

135
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:45,682
WE ARE STILL
HOURS AWAY

136
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,510
FROM THE BATWOMAN NAME DROP,

137
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,164
BUT CURIOSITY
HAS ALREADY PULLED

138
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,079
SOME GOTHAM RESIDENTS
TO THE STREETS,

139
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:54,909
REACTING TO CLAIMS MADE
BY WAYNE CEO MARQUIS JET

140
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,650
THAT HE KNOWS
THE SCARLET KNIGHT'S

141
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,913
SECRET IDENTITY
AND THAT WE SHOULD ALL BRACE

142
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,567
FOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

143
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,656
NO DETAILS BEYOND THAT
WERE TEASED,

144
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,093
BUT PUTTING A FACE TO THE NAME
WOULD CERTAINLY BE

145
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:08,488
THE END OF BUSINESS AS USUAL
FOR THE CAPED CRUSADER,

146
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,534
WHOSE ANONYMITY IS KEY
TO HER OWN SAFETY

147
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:13,231
AND THOSE OF HER LOVED ONES.

148
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:14,972
WHILE VARIOUS THEORIES
SURROUNDING

149
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:17,540
WHO'S BEHIND THE MASK
HAVE BEEN BOUNCING AROUND

150
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,846
SOCIAL MEDIA...

151
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,151
OH. GUYS.

152
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,937
TOLD YOU
SHE DOESN'T KNOCK.

153
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,026
I TAKE IT YOU SAW
MARQUIS' THREATS.

154
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,507
I BELIEVE 10 MILLION PEOPLE
SAW MARQUIS' THREATS.

155
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,509
HOW ON EARTH
DID HE HIJACK

156
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:32,294
EVERY PHONE, TV, AND
LIVESTREAM IN THIS CITY?

157
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:33,556
HE GOT INTO THE BATCAVE.

158
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,838
FROM THERE, HE FOUND
THE COMPUTER,

159
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:36,385
WHICH LED TO WAYNE'S
SATELLITE,

160
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,256
WHICH HE USED TO OVERRIDE
GOTHAM'S AIRWAVES.

161
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,910
MY DAD CREATED THE TECH
IN THE EVENT

162
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,999
THAT BATMAN HAD TO SEND
AN SOS TO EVERY PERSON

163
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,610
IN THE CITY ALL AT ONCE.

164
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,394
ANY CHANCE YOU CAN
TRACE THE ORIGINAL FEED

165
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,874
BACK TO ITS LOCATION?

166
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,155
WITHOUT ACCESS
TO THE BATCAVE, I WAS LUCKY

167
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,790
TO BE ABLE TO GET
A SCREENCAP.

168
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,183
WELL, THAT'S NOT
GONNA HELP US.

169
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:54,142
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

170
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,926
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW YOUR FATHER

171
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,059
ALWAYS REPEATED HIMSELF
WHEN HE GOT MAD?

172
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:00,844
- VIVIDLY. WHY?
- I CAN HEAR HIM NOW.

173
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:03,281
"JADA, JADA, JADA,
YOU LET MY BOY

174
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:06,023
"TAKE ON MARQUIS WITH A
SMARTPHONE AND A DIALUP?

175
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:09,287
MM-MM-MM."

176
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,333
I'M SURE MY TECH TEAM
CAN PULL

177
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:15,859
A CARRIER-GRADE ROUTER
OFF JETURIAN'S SERVER FARM.

178
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:19,167
UH... THANK YOU?

179
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,777
WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

180
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,605
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
MARQUIS AND BUZZ HIM

181
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:23,954
WITH THAT JOY BUZZER.

182
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,390
WHERE'S RYAN?

183
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:28,176
AHEM. THAT IS SUCH
A GOOD QUESTION.

184
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:31,745
UH... WHERE'S RYAN?

185
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:35,792
RIGHT. UH, SOPHIE, DIDN'T RYAN
TELL YOU WHERE SHE WAS HEADED?

186
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,098
UH, YES.
I BELIEVE SHE SAID

187
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,621
SHE WAS RUNNING
AN ERRAND.

188
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:40,188
RIGHT. THAT'S
WHAT I REMEMBER.

189
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,191
ERRAND. DUH. SHE DID
MENTION AN ERRAND.

190
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,801
WHERE WAS IT AGAIN?

191
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:47,325
TELL ME WHY YOU
DESERVE THE JOY BUZZER.

192
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:49,632
SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUT
ENJOYING YOUR LAST FEW HOURS

193
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,503
OF SUPERHERO
ANONYMITY?

194
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:54,550
YEAH, I SHOULD.
INSTEAD, I'M HERE

195
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,073
DOING MY BEST FRIEND
A SOLID

196
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,814
WHILE THE PERSON
WHO ACTUALLY NEEDS IT

197
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,218
IS OUT THERE THREATENING
TO DESTROY

198
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,818
EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED FOR.

199
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,515
OH, YOU MEAN THE
BROTHER YOU'RE SCARED

200
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,040
IS TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE?

201
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,043
FACE IT, RY-RY, YOU CAN
BLAME MARY ALL YOU WANT,

202
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:12,350
BUT DEEP DOWN IN THAT
LITTLE ORPHAN HEART,

203
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:14,526
YOU NEED ME
TO HAVE THAT THING.

204
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,486
OH, WOW. MARY WAS RIGHT.
YOU DID STOP MAKING SENSE.

205
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,227
OR... CHANCES ARE
YOU SPENT

206
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,272
THE LAST FEW MONTHS
DAYDREAMING

207
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:23,623
ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE
LIKE TO HAVE A NUCLEAR FAMILY.

208
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,537
THANKSGIVING DINNERS,

209
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,670
FAMILY GAME NIGHTS,

210
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:31,282
THE COMFORT OF A KIDNEY SHOULD
A NEW ONE BECOME NECESSARY.

211
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:34,590
YOUR DESPERATION'S SHOWING.

212
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,680
WHAT IF YOU ZAP MARQUIS

213
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,160
AND THAT GOOD
LITTLE BOY BURIED

214
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,857
BENEATH THAT TACKY
CLOWN SUIT TURNS OUT

215
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,077
TO BE DOING JUST FINE

216
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,384
WITHOUT HIS NEEDY
LITTLE SISTER?

217
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,604
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO
RISK GETTING YOUR HOPES UP

218
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,999
ONLY TO HAVE HIM LEAVE
YOU LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?

219
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:58,396
I'M YOUR SAFE BET,
RYAN. HEH HEH.

220
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,485
PSYCHO OR SANE,

221
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,227
YOU DON'T NEED ME
TO LOVE YOU BACK.

222
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:18,025
OUR STINGRAYS CAN
SIMULATE A CELL TOWER,

223
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,635
AND SINCE OUR SUPERCOMPUTERS
ARE TOO BIG

224
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,768
TO WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR,
YOU'LL NEED THIS,

225
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:25,249
A SECURE ACCESS POINT TO THE
QUANTUM COMPUTER AT GOTHAM UNIVERSITY.

226
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,512
DID YOU SAY
QUANTUM COMPUTER?

227
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:30,602
YOUR FATHER HAD ME FUND
THE COMPUTER LAB IT LIVES IN.

228
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:33,649
IT SEEMS ONLY RIGHT
YOU USE IT.

229
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,783
GREG, TELL HERSHEL TO PULL
THE GENERATOR INTO THE ALLEY.

230
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,306
YES, MA'AM.

231
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,805
THIS PROCESSOR MAKES
THE BATCAVE LOOK LIKE

232
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,309
IT RUNS
ON A HAMSTER WHEEL.

233
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:42,963
WHERE WERE ALL
OF THESE RESOURCES

234
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,766
WHEN JADA DIDN'T THINK
WE HAD THE JOY BUZZER?

235
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,314
DIBS ON NOT BEING
THE ONE TO TELL HER.

236
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:48,533
ANY UPDATE FROM RYAN?

237
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:49,883
NOT YET.

238
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,453
SO WHAT'S IT
GONNA BE, RY-RY?

239
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,979
WOW. THIS WAS
A WASTE OF MY TIME.

240
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:01,590
HAVE A NICE LIFE, ALICE.

241
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,592
I DON'T DESERVE
THE JOY BUZZER, OK?

242
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,641
WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED TO HEAR...

243
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,297
BUT I DO HAVE A LITTLE
PIECE OF INFORMATION

244
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:17,388
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IF YOU
WANT TO LIVE TO SEE TOMORROW.

245
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,216
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

246
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,308
DARE I SAY IT'S
ACCURATE TO ASSUME

247
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:27,834
THAT MARQUIS IS
HARBORING A...

248
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:30,619
WEE, LITTLE MAN CRUSH
ON THE JOKER?

249
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,411
GOT A HIT. HONING IN
ON MARQUIS' LOCATION NOW.

250
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:41,848
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE SENSE?

251
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,371
WHAT ARE ALL
OF THOSE?

252
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:44,827
HIS SINGULAR CELL I.D.
IS PINGING OFF

253
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,461
10 DIFFERENT SHOPS
IN GOTHAM SQUARE.

254
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,245
ACCORDING
TO YOUR BROTHER,

255
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,247
WHEN HE WAS 7, THE
JOKER JUMPED ON HIS BUS

256
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,815
AND WHISPERED
HIS BIG, EVIL PLAN

257
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,862
TO DESTROY GOTHAM CITY
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

258
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:59,822
UNFORTUNATELY
FOR THE JOKER,

259
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,606
BATTY STOPPED HIM AND
DUMPED HIM INTO ARKHAM

260
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,086
BEFORE HE COULD
PULL IT OFF,

261
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,090
BUT, UM, CURIOUS CATHY
OVER HERE

262
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:09,614
WANDERED DOWN TO THE CAF

263
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,573
AND ASKED A FEW
OF THE ARKHAM LIFERS

264
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:14,271
IF MR. SMILEY PANTS
HAD EVER...

265
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:18,145
TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE HAD
PLANNED ON DOING THAT DAY.

266
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:22,062
WOW. DID I EVER HEAR
THE MOST...

267
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:24,281
INTERESTING RIDDLE.

268
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:26,631
HE'S MOVING,
JUST REALLY, REALLY SLOW.

269
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,546
CONVERTING COORDINATES,
ADDING ALTITUDE.

270
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,089
HE'S NOT ON THE GROUND.
HE'S IN THE AIR.

271
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:31,811
SO, WHAT? MARQUIS
TOOK THE WAYNE JET?

272
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,136
WELL, IF THE WAYNE JET
MOVED THAT SLOW,

273
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,639
IT WOULD FALL OUT
OF THE SKY.

274
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:38,339
- NO.
- WHAT?

275
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:43,213
NO. NO! NO!

276
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,521
WHAT WAS IT?

277
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,915
TEASE THEM
WITH A RIDDLE,

278
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,918
GET THEM ALL OUTSIDE.

279
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:57,445
WHAT'S WET AND MELTS
AND ISN'T SNOW

280
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:59,577
BUT ENDS IN GENOCIDE?

281
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:04,974
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
MY IDENTITY, IS IT?

282
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,065
THAT WAS JUST THE DRAW.

283
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:14,549
THIS... IS ABOUT
THE JOKER'S DESIRE

284
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:17,769
TO PUNISH THE CITY
FOR WORSHIPING

285
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,554
THE BAT SYMBOL.

286
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:28,693
IT'S ABOUT KILLING
AS MANY PEOPLE

287
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:31,392
AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE

288
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,350
AND RIDDLING THIS CITY
WITH SURVIVORS

289
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:35,309
THAT ARE AS UGLY
AS HIM.

290
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:39,400
HOW? HOW DOES ONE PERSON
BLOW UP AN ENTIRE CITY?

291
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:41,968
HE TOOK IT. IT'S GONE.

292
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,708
HE MUST HAVE FOUND
THE LOCATION

293
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,164
OF THE SECRET AIRSTRIP
IN THE BATCAVE'S RECORDS.

294
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:47,321
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S GONE? WHAT'S GONE?

295
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:48,583
THE BATBLIMP.

296
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:34,716
THE GAME'S CHANGED.

297
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,674
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT MY IDENTITY.

298
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:38,633
IT'S ABOUT LURING 10 MILLION
INNOCENT PEOPLE

299
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,330
TO THEIR DEATHS.

300
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:42,071
IN ONE HOUR, MARQUIS IS
DROPPING ACID BOMBS

301
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,812
OVER THE CITY
AND DESTROYING EVERYTHING

302
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:46,467
AND EVERYONE
IN ITS BLAST RADIUS,

303
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,010
SO WE MAY BE IN A BAR
DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT

304
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,645
OF BATMAN'S GREATEST ENEMY
WITHOUT A JOY BUZZER

305
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:52,386
OR TIME TO THINK STRAIGHT,

306
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,388
BUT WE DON'T
GET EXCUSES.

307
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:57,521
- NO ONE DIES TODAY. AM I CLEAR?
- CRYSTAL.

308
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,655
GOOD. ANY CHANCE YOU CAN HACK
INTO THE CONTROLS OF THE BATBLIMP?

309
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,154
I'VE NEVER ONCE SEEN
THE BLIMP'S INTERFACE,

310
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:03,658
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE
THE COORDINATES

311
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,181
ARE VULNERABLE TO
AN ISMI CATCHER.

312
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,680
- NEED A YES OR NO.
- I CAN'T LAND IT,

313
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:07,899
BUT I CAN PROBABLY
GET IT CLOSE.

314
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,446
CLOSE IS ALL WE NEED.

315
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,753
I NEED YOU TO DIRECT IT
TO THE GCPD ROOFTOP.

316
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:13,276
WHY? WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING?

317
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,712
SO YOU CAN STOP ME?

318
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,236
IT'S THAT CRAZY?

319
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,020
LOOK AT YOU FIGURING
ME OUT ALREADY.

320
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:20,109
NO TIME FOR DETAILS.
BESIDES, I NEED YOU AND MARY

321
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,261
TO PUT YOUR BRAINS TOGETHER
TO GET EVERYONE IN THE CITY

322
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:25,158
TO TAKE COVER WITHOUT
INCITING A CHAOS MOB.

323
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,943
HOW? NOT TO THROW SHADE
ON MY OWN SEX APPEAL HERE,

324
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,076
BUT YOU KNOW I ONLY
HAVE, LIKE, 300 FOLLOWERS

325
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,992
ON SOCIALS, RIGHT?

326
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,385
THE BATMAN TROPHIES.

327
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,083
CHANCES ARE MARQUIS
CLEANED HOUSE

328
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:38,998
ON THE BATWEAPONS,
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS

329
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,608
TO THE WING
WITH THE TROPHY ROOM

330
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,305
WITHOUT BATWOMAN'S DNA.

331
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:45,047
- SO?
- SO BETWEEN THE MAD HATTER'S HAT

332
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,310
AND THE CONDIMENT KING'S
GUN, SURELY THERE'S

333
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,443
SOME KOOKY TOOL IN THERE
THAT CAN INFLUENCE

334
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,966
PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR.

335
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,881
OK. LET'S
SAY THERE WERE.

336
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:55,057
HOW THE HELL DO WE
GET INTO THE BATCAVE?

337
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,798
I'M SURE MARQUIS
QUADRUPLED SECURITY

338
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,278
SINCE BATWING AND I
GOT BUSTED

339
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,497
BREAKING INTO WAYNE.

340
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,065
JADA'S REALLY NOT HAPPY
WITH ME,

341
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,111
BUT I MAY HAVE AN IDEA.

342
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,901
I'M SORRY.

343
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:19,255
WHEN YOU SAID WE'D
GET OUR FAMILY BACK,

344
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,691
I TRUSTED YOU.

345
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,476
WE WILL GET
OUR FAMILY BACK.

346
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:25,914
HOW? THAT BUZZER WAS
THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE MARQUIS.

347
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,090
YOU KNEW THAT,
AND YOU STILL GAVE IT AWAY.

348
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:29,918
HAVING THAT BUZZER
IN OUR POSSESSION

349
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,485
WOULDN'T CHANGE
THE FACT THAT A BLIMP

350
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:33,095
HOVERING OVER OUR CITY
IS ABOUT TO DOUSE

351
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,402
OUR STREETS WITH
THE JOKER'S ACID BOMBS.

352
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,578
WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE
TO SAFETY.

353
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,493
I HAVE CONNECTIONS, RYAN,

354
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,973
BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

355
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:43,366
IS GOING TO TAKE
MY CALL.

356
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,455
I DON'T NEED
THE PRESIDENT.

357
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,414
I NEED MY MOM

358
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:49,155
TO PICK UP HER PHONE

359
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,505
AND GET ME WAYNE
ENTERPRISES BACK.

360
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:54,725
DO TO HIM WHAT YOU
DID TO ME.

361
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:57,989
IF IT WERE THAT SIMPLE, I
WOULD HAVE DONE IT WEEKS AGO.

362
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:03,430
MARQUIS IS SMART.
HIS ACCOUNTING IS BULLETPROOF.

363
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:06,998
AND I'M GUESSING
HE'S NOT HIDING

364
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,349
A BILLION-DOLLAR
VIGILANTE FUND.

365
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:16,921
NO, BUT HE IS HIDING
SOMETHING...

366
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:19,359
THE UGLY TRUTH.

367
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:23,145
JADA...
IF YOU DO MEAN

368
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,929
WHAT I THINK
YOU MEAN,

369
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:26,409
THERE COULD BE
SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS

370
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,846
FOR YOU, TOO.

371
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,677
I'VE RISKED EVERYTHING
TO PROTECT MY SON AND FAILED.

372
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:37,420
IT'S TIME I TAKE A PAGE
FROM MY DAUGHTER'S HANDBOOK.

373
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,640
IT'S TIME TO PUT
THE CITY FIRST.

374
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:53,741
IT'S NEVER GOOD WHEN YOUR CFO
CALLS YOU AT MARTINI O'CLOCK.

375
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:55,046
YEAH.

376
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:00,139
WHO SAID THAT?

377
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,532
HEH. UH-HUH.

378
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,709
YOU THINK YOU CAN FIRE ME?

379
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:08,582
YOU AND WHO ELSE?

380
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,847
OH! THE DOJ. HA HA HA!

381
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,632
THAT'S RICH. YEAH.
HAVE FUN WITH THAT.

382
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,773
MARQUIS JET'S
OWN MOTHER,

383
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,514
BUSINESS TYCOON JADA JET,

384
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:30,995
JUST ADMITTED TO
THE DECADES-LONG FAMILY SECRET.

385
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,607
3 YEARS AGO, FRANKLIN JET
WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD

386
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,348
AFTER A FALL.

387
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:38,133
THESE ALLEGATIONS NOW
THROW THAT INTO QUESTION.

388
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,570
MEANWHILE, THE WAYNE BOARD
HAS UNANIMOUSLY

389
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:44,270
REAPPOINTED RYAN WILDER
TO THE CEO POSITION,

390
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:47,316
CALLING HER PREVIOUS
RESIGNATION COERCED.

391
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,102
THAT POSITION WOULD BE
REINSTATED IMMEDIATELY. MS...

392
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:58,893
HEH. YOU THINK I CARE
ABOUT WAYNE OR... OR... OR FAMILY

393
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,590
OR ANY OF YOU IDIOTS?!

394
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,903
DON'T YOU GET IT?

395
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:10,557
NONE OF YOU MATTER ANYMORE.

396
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,215
LUKE, WE'RE IN.
JADA'S PLAY WORKED.

397
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,261
WAYNE TOWER WAS
POSTAPOCALYPTIC.

398
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:22,264
SO... READY TO TEACH ME
HOW TO DO THIS?

399
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,964
LUKE? HELLO?
BATCAVE TO LUKE.

400
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,836
YEP. I COPY.
JUST FURIOUSLY HACKING

401
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,490
INTO A NUCLEAR BATBLIMP
FROM A BARSTOOL.

402
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,274
APOLOGIES
FOR THE 3-SECOND DELAY.

403
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,668
OK. I'M AT THE COMPUTER.

404
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,453
TELL ME HOW MARQUIS WAS
ABLE TO HIJACK THE AIRWAVES.

405
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,599
OK. ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE
SATELLITE ACCESS PORTAL?

406
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,993
UH, THE THING WITH THE
DOTS AND THE NUMBERS?

407
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:58,169
LET'S ASSUME YES. SO
YOU'RE GONNA GET A PROMPT.

408
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,562
THEN YOU NEED TO
CLAIM ACCESS

409
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,347
TO EACH
OF THE SATELLITES.

410
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,087
UH...

411
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,674
JUST CLICK THE BOX NEXT
TO THE SATELLITE FILE.

412
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,700
OK. CLICKING BOXES.

413
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,835
IT'S KIND OF CREEPY
HOW EASY THIS IS.

414
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:14,597
WELL, CONSIDERING I JUST HAD TO REMIND
YOU WHERE THE POWER SWITCH WAS...

415
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,362
OK. TEAM DOCTOR,
NOT THE TECHIE.

416
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:19,190
I'D LIKE TO SEE ONE OF YOUR
PATIENT INTAKE REPORTS.

417
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,062
- I MISSED THIS.
- WHAT? ME FUMBLING

418
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:24,935
OVER THIS ELECTRONIC
PAPERWEIGHT YOU CALL A COMPUTER?

419
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,241
US.

420
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,290
ME, TOO.

421
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:49,351
OK. I'M TWO CLICKS AWAY FROM
CONTROLLING GOTHAM'S AIRWAVES.

422
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:53,137
OK. COOL. WHAT DID
SOPHIE LAND ON?

423
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,708
THE PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA.

424
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,971
INDUCING GOTHAM
INTO A HYPNOTIC STATE

425
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:02,364
VIA EYE FASCINATION.

426
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:03,757
I MEAN, THAT...
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

427
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:07,543
OK. HEY. UH, GET
YOUR HYPNO ON.

428
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,023
I JUST GOT INTO THE BLIMP.

429
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,285
BATBAR TO BATWOMAN.

430
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,595
- JUST LANDED.
- ALL RIGHT. I'M IN.

431
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:16,987
I'M ENTERING
YOUR COORDINATES NOW.

432
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,554
LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU SEE IT.

433
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:22,341
YEAH.

434
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,607
GOT EYES.

435
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:52,240
AH. I LOVE YOU MORONS.

436
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,592
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

437
00:22:56,636 --> 00:23:00,248
HEY. HEY!

438
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,945
WHY DID WE DROP?

439
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:03,599
I HAVE NO IDEA,
MR. JET.

440
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:05,483
COMPUTER CHANGED COORDINATES
AND LOCKED ME OUT.

441
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:07,211
WELL, THEN PUT IT
IN AUTOPILOT.

442
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,561
I DID. NOTHING IS
WORKING, SIR.

443
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:09,866
IT'S TOTALLY DEAD.

444
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,826
GUESS YOU TWO
HAVE THAT IN COMMON.

445
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:19,049
LUKE, I NEED THIS THING
TO BE A LOT LOWER.

446
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:21,095
YEAH. TRYING.
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

447
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:23,532
I'M LITERALLY STARING
AT A TICKING CLOCK HERE.

448
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,380
YEAH. I LOST ACCESS.
EVERYTHING JUST DROPPED OFFLINE.

449
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,796
I NEED SOME TIME
TO GET BACK IN.

450
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,538
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

451
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:31,235
WISH ME LUCK.

452
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,691
WHOA, WHOA, HEY, HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

453
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,064
TAKING THE SCENIC ROUTE.

454
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:35,414
LORD, HELP ME.

455
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,171
I'M IN THE CARGO HOLD NOW.

456
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,521
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

457
00:23:58,175 --> 00:23:59,612
PLEASE TELL ME
THEY TAUGHT YOU

458
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,614
HOW TO DISARM A BOMB
AT POINT ROCK.

459
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,006
GET ME EYES ON IT.

460
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,228
HALF A DOZEN DRUMS.

461
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,188
ALL ATTACHED TO A TIMER
THAT TELLS ME

462
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:13,016
WE HAVE LESS
THAN 15 MINUTES

463
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,497
BEFORE MARQUIS MAKES IT
RAIN ACID ALL OVER GOTHAM.

464
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,151
WHERE DO I START?

465
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,068
- YOU DON'T.
- OK. I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING

466
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,896
MORE LIKE
CUT THE GREEN OR PURPLE.

467
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,593
I COUNT AT LEAST
4 TRIPWIRES

468
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:26,508
THAT WOULD SET
THIS OFF EARLY,

469
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,467
NOT TO MENTION ANY OTHER
NASTY HIDDEN SURPRISES

470
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,903
THE JOKER MIGHT HAVE
LEFT BEHIND.

471
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:31,513
YOU TOUCH ANY ONE
OF THOSE WIRES,

472
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,472
THE WHOLE DAMN THING
COULD GO.

473
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,128
WHERE THE HELL ARE WE
WITH EVACING THE CITY?

474
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:40,479
I'M JUST ABOUT TO ACCESS
WAYNE SECURITY MAINFRAME

475
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:44,134
AND DROP A HOT TIP... NOW.

476
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:53,187
GET UNDERGROUND IMMEDIATELY.

477
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,059
TAKE COVER.
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

478
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,887
GET UNDERGROUND IMMEDIATELY.

479
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,716
TAKE COVER.
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

480
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,544
GET UNDERGROUND IMMEDIATELY.

481
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:05,547
TAKE COVER.
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

482
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,418
GET UNDERGROUND IMMEDIATELY.

483
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:10,160
TAKE COVER.
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

484
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,382
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S WORKING.

485
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:17,733
THE PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA IS ACTUALLY
HYPNOTIZING PEOPLE TO TAKE COVER.

486
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:19,430
YOU HEAR THAT,
BATWOMAN?

487
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:21,215
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS.
YOU OUT OF THERE YET?

488
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,522
I'M GONNA TRY TO REROUTE
THE BLIMP OVER THE OCEAN.

489
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:34,794
OK. TELL ME YOU LEARNED
HOW TO WIRE

490
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:36,970
A BLIMP'S CONTROLS
AT POINT ROCK.

491
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,774
PRETTY SURE PILOT A GIANT
COMBUSTIBLE BALLOON WASN'T

492
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:40,713
OFFERED
IN BASIC TRAINING.

493
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:42,628
THIS THING BLOWS,

494
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:44,586
ACID'S STILL GONNA RAIN DOWN
OVER THE CITY.

495
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,470
ONCE MARQUIS REALIZES
WE TOOK AWAY HIS AUDIENCE,

496
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,198
HE COULD TRIGGER THE
BOMB AT ANY MOMENT

497
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,591
WITH YOU STILL
INSIDE.

498
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:51,114
I CAN'T JUST WALK
AWAY FROM THIS.

499
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,855
I'M NOT LOSING
YOU, RYAN!

500
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,120
YOU DON'T GET TO PLAY
THE CRAZY CARD WITH ME.

501
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,908
I'M NOT LOSING YOU.

502
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:04,519
NOBODY'S EVER SAID
THAT TO ME BEFORE.

503
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,609
AND NOBODY
EVER WILL AGAIN.

504
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,239
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO

505
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:10,960
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON
BELOW.

506
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:13,920
SEE, THIS IS WHY I NEVER
WANTED A LITTLE SISTER.

507
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:16,879
THEY RUIN ALL THE FUN.

508
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:19,490
YOUR DEFINITION OF FUN IS
BLOWING UP HALF OF GOTHAM?

509
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,623
WHOA. WHY
SO PESSIMISTIC?

510
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,147
THAT MEANS HALF
THE ISLAND LIVES

511
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:25,845
TO REMEMBER THE DAY
THAT THE BATBLIMP

512
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,629
DISFIGURED THEM
BEYOND RECOGNITION

513
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,326
AND BATWOMAN DIDN'T
SAVE THEM.

514
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,850
ERR! UNH!

515
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,647
DISARM THE BOMB.

516
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,257
EVERYONE'S TAKEN COVER
