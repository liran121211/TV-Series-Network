1
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,480
- Help!
- Help me!

2
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Pam!

3
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,320
What are you doing?

4
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,640
I thought the water would revive me.

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,040
I was wrong.

6
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,880
I need to get my strength back.

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,160
How did you do it, Mama?

8
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,720
{\an5}Three jobs, volunteering at church,
raising me.

9
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,920
{\an5}You were literally everything
to everyone

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400
and you didn't break a sweat.

11
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,280
I just...

12
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,560
{\an5}I can't get out of my damn head.

13
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
What am I doing wrong?

14
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,960
{\an5}Pretty sure in the real world,
this would be an HR violation

15
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,600
{\an5}of appropriate workplace behavior.

16
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,040
Good thing it's not the real world.

17
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Well, hurry up.

18
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,480
{\an5}You're breathing like Darth Vader

19
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
{\an5}and making me feel bad

20
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,560
{\an5}about that bagel I had for breakfast.

21
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,800
{\an5}Great. Then you can help.

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,160
- You wanna talk about it?
- Nope.

23
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,240
- Does Ryan know?
- Nope.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Does this have something to do
with Marquis Jet?

25
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,400
{\an5}Never thought I would see
the Jada Jet look so defeated.

26
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,920
{\an5}When I got your message
you sound like

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,280
{\an5}you've been put
through a wringer or two.

28
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,640
John Diggle.

29
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,600
{\an5}It's good to see you, old friend.

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,720
So...

31
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,680
Why don't you tell me...

32
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,160
{\an5}how an old friend can help?

33
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
Sunlight's not working.

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,080
{\an5}It's been 10 years, Pam.
Give yourself some time.

35
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,120
Time? I've got nothing but time.

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,960
{\an5}Something's wrong.

37
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,880
{\an5}My energy's depleting so quickly.

38
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,600
Didn't stop you from attacking
two innocent fishermen.

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
{\an5}The lake's catch and release.

40
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,800
{\an5}They were creating an imbalance

41
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,520
{\an5}in an already vulnerable species.

42
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,520
{\an5}Ten years and suddenly
it's like yesterday.

43
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,800
{\an5}What were you thinking would happen

44
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,600
when you freed me?

45
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,400
I wasn't.

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,800
{\an5}I wrapped up in the moment
seeing you

47
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,920
{\an5}the white tulip, the memories,
the guilt...

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,320
{\an5}Oh. I'm so sorry that you had
to feel guilt, Renee

49
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,560
while I rotted for a decade
with no water, sunlight

50
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,840
or soulmate.

51
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,840
That must have been
really awful for you.

52
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,400
I am sorry, Pam.

53
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,920
How am I supposed to believe that?

54
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,800
I needed you, more than anything.

55
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,680
And you're the one
that put me there.

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,480
I know how to get your strength back.

57
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
I come bearing sustenance.

58
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Very mature.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,920
I was able to keep Jada off our backs
while we hunt Pam Isley.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,840
Dead fisherman on Loeb Lake.

61
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,160
Found with weeds tangled
around his legs.

62
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,760
So this is happening?

63
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
You're gonna give me
the silent treatment

64
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,200
for the rest of our lives?

65
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
A little busy, Soph.

66
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,080
Your girlfriend Renee is on the loose
with an eco-terrorist.

67
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,120
She's not my girlfriend.

68
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,920
So can we assume that the dead
fisherman is the OG Ivy and not Mary

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,040
considering he's, you know, dead?

70
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,960
There was also an
unnatural hornet attack

71
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,880
reported at a pesticide factory
last night.

72
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,120
Injured six employees.

73
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,600
Matches what I found.

74
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,640
A nearby drilling operation
got shut down

75
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,960
because of a tipped oil rig.

76
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,560
Okay. All these attacks
are environment-based.

77
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,640
- That's Pam Isley's MO.
- I'll triangulate these sites.

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,600
Even if we do find her, then what?

79
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm actually working on that.

80
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,480
The darts are filled with
a paralytic drug and a herbicide.

81
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,520
So it won't kill her

82
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,720
and it will slow down her system
long enough for us to figure out

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
how to recreate
the desiccation serum.

84
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,640
Good news, bad news.

85
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,480
All of these attacks are within
a two-mile radius

86
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,040
of a general location.

87
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,760
Supposed to start with the bad news.

88
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Bad news is, this is the location.

89
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,360
The national park?

90
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,920
We're going to be hunting
Mother Nature

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,640
in the middle of Mother Nature?

92
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,680
I'm down if you are.

93
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,440
Ever watch a horror movie?

94
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,320
When black people go into the woods,
they usually don't come out.

95
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,440
black people never write
those movies.

96
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,960
What do you say we flip the script?

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,840
I had no idea things
have gotten this bad.

98
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,240
When Marquis wakes up

99
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,440
there's no doubt
he'll go after his sister.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,360
That's why I called you.

101
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,360
I want to offer you a job
as head of my security detail.

102
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,400
You'd be protecting Ryan, me,
the company

103
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,120
like old times, except Franklin's
not in charge, I am.

104
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,320
Well then it's exactly
like old times.

105
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,440
I know there's a way to fix my boy.

106
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Call it hubris or naivete,
or mother's will

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,160
but I will not lock him up
in an Arkham cell

108
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,920
for something that wasn't his fault.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Jada...

110
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,240
I appreciate you thinking of me.
Thank you.

111
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
But I can't accept.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,520
When you offered to come by
in person, I got my hopes up.

113
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,960
Well, I just so happen
to be in Gotham

114
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
for other matters.

115
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,600
Have you ever thought about
helping your son's psychosis

116
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,840
by going back to the source?

117
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,520
The Joker's joy buzzer?

118
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,080
That's what I'm trying to do.

119
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
Every neurologist I've talked to says

120
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,360
that another jolt would reawaken
his empathy.

121
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
But I have spent millions
looking for the buzzer

122
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,640
but no one's seen it since the Joker
disappeared years ago.

123
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
- It's gone.
- Maybe it's not.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,640
I've been following your news.

125
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,680
The Mad Hatter, Killer Croc,
Mr. Freeze, all Batman's enemies.

126
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,920
And now their weapons just show up
out of nowhere?

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,040
Do you think they're part
of some collection?

128
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,640
I think they were. Yeah.

129
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,320
And somehow they made their way
out to the street.

130
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,360
And considering The Joker
was Batman's greatest enemy

131
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,120
maybe the buzzer
is out there now too.

132
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,920
I had some folks over at ARGUS
look into this.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,800
A former police officer,
Renee Montoya

134
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,960
now works for the mayor's
off-books "Rogues Unit"

135
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,640
looking at all of these events.

136
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,240
Maybe it's worth the two of us
popping by to say hello.

137
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,880
I read about this phenomenon
where plants communicate

138
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,880
through acoustics in the ground.

139
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,000
Wind blows at a certain frequency,
fungi send distress signals.

140
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,360
It's called "Natural Networking".

141
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,800
It's kind of hot.

142
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
You...

143
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,680
reading glasses on, head in a book...

144
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,120
thinking about fungi...

145
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,000
I figured the cutting Batman

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,160
saved infected Mary Hamilton
for a reason.

147
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,560
My sporeling.

148
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Your what?

149
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,520
A piece of me created her to bring me
back to health.

150
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,400
Like a battery

151
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,800
without a plug.

152
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,720
If I can draw her here,
she'll revive me.

153
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,160
Let's hope this works then.

154
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,120
No, no, no, no.

155
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
One triple-shot frappe.

156
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,880
Extra sweet cream. And conveniently,
free of charge.

157
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,880
Oh, and I have a gift for you.

158
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,680
How about an all-inclusive vacation
to Santorini?

159
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,640
Why Santorini?

160
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,400
Cute bikinis, non-stop sunshine,
far, far away from Gotham...

161
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,920
Need I go on?

162
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
Nope.

163
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,080
But I'm in charge of the music.

164
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,080
I refuse to listen to a boy band
sing about condiments for two hours.

165
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,160
Brain freeze.

166
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,560
Not a brain freeze.

167
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
What the hell is going on?

168
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,000
I have no idea.

169
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,600
Look, I admit I royally screwed up
with Renee.

170
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,080
Sleeping with her...

171
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,120
trusting her, defending her,
everything.

172
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Seriously, my bad. All right?

173
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,320
Yep.

174
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,920
That's it? Yep?

175
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,880
I'm trying to be real with you.

176
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,000
I appreciate that.

177
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,200
But it doesn't take away
from the fact

178
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,600
that we are driving into the woods
to fight Poison Ivy

179
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,760
who Renee freed and probably told
everything to.

180
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,960
My identity, our plan,
our vulnerabilities...

181
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,200
Look out!

182
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,920
You have to help me, please.

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,560
Oh, my God.

184
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,880
You're okay. We got you.

185
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,320
We need to get out of here.
We're not safe.

186
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,760
What do you mean?
Who did this to you?

187
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,440
Sophie!

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,080
Run!

189
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,280
- I can't.
- No. We have to keep moving.

190
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Come on. Come on.

191
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,240
Luke, gun!

192
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,760
Gun! Go!

193
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
Luke, we gotta go.

194
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,280
We gotta go. Luke, we gotta go.

195
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,160
Guys, be careful. Let's go!

196
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,440
Now what?

197
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Luke.

198
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,440
Luke.

199
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,480
You wanna tell us what's going on?

200
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,680
Well, just saw an innocent man
get impaled with a root.

201
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,800
So, three guesses.

202
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,480
That wasn't your fault.

203
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,920
This is all my fault.
How did you not get that?

204
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,000
Okay. What is the common denominator
of all our problems?

205
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,240
The Batwing suit breaks half the time
because of me.

206
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,400
We couldn't save Mary from Poison Ivy
because of me.

207
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,240
A fricking vine snagged
the dart gun away because of me.

208
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,560
My dad knew it all along.

209
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,920
There is one reason
he didn't give me the suit

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,320
and one reason only...

211
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,520
I am not a hero.

212
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,800
You know how you know you're
on the journey to being a hero?

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You fail.

214
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,360
Look at Sophie.

215
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,400
Alice and Pam
both escaped on her watch

216
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,520
and she worked security
for five years.

217
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,920
True.

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,160
And Ryan,
the supposed team detective

219
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
didn't even notice that

220
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,960
her own roommate
was infected with Poison Ivy

221
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,320
until it was way too late.

222
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,440
Talk about screwing up big time.

223
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,680
See? No one's perfect.

224
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,720
You can't spiral on us.

225
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,000
We need your obnoxiously superior
brain to get us out of here.

226
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,800
All right, well, shotgun, handful of
shells, vinegar, baking powder, saw

227
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,120
and a whole bunch of other crap
from this cabin.

228
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,040
You think you can figure out
another way to take her down?

229
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
I can try.

230
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,520
I take it you didn't find Mary.

231
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,560
I had other company.

232
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,120
What did you do?

233
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
How did Batwoman know where I'd be?

234
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Pam...

235
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,440
answer me right now.

236
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,480
What did you do?

237
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,480
They're fine.

238
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,960
But now you've got me wondering
why you're so concerned.

239
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,480
They're not bad people.

240
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,320
Batman buried me alive.

241
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,520
I told you, Ryan is not Batman.

242
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,360
And what do you think
she's gonna do to me?

243
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,920
- Let me talk to her...
- And tell her what?

244
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,440
That you can change.

245
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,680
I am sorry, Pam, for hurting you.

246
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,560
I will regret what I did
for the rest of my life.

247
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,160
But you can't keep going down
this path.

248
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,680
I want you to be healthy and safe.

249
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,560
I want us to be able to heal
and leave this city behind.

250
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,960
Can't I, alone, be worth it?

251
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,840
Of course you're worth it.

252
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,880
And one day,
we will leave this city behind.

253
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,480
But right now, I need to make sure
no one standing in my way.

254
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,240
Stay put.

255
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,840
Don't move a muscle.

256
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,120
I'm going to kill Batwoman,
and then we can work on us.

257
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,160
Looks like the city doesn't
have much hope for the Rogues Unit.

258
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,680
She's not here.

259
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,800
You got a hairpin
in that fancy thing?

260
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Thank you.

261
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Give me.

262
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,240
You can take the girl out
of the streets

263
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,160
but you can't take
the street out of the girl.

264
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
You haven't changed one bit,
haven't you?

265
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,000
I got back with my wife.

266
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Lucky her.

267
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,640
Looks like we're in the right place.

268
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,520
Like you said...

269
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,000
these belonged to Batman

270
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
then somehow managed
to fall into the river

271
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,440
and into the hands
of would-be killers.

272
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think a certain hero
has some explaining to do.

273
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
Okay.

274
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,360
I feel better since we turned.

275
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,800
Hey. Good. Yeah.

276
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,800
Santorini here we come.

277
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,920
Okay, it's back. Turn back.

278
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,720
Do you want to run out of gas?

279
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,360
Alice, I'm serious.

280
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,320
- Stop the car.
- No.

281
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,240
I said stop!

282
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Stop!

283
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,000
I am supposed to be the crazy one.

284
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,560
You're not the one
with the bitch of a migraine

285
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,240
that only seems to stop bitching
when I go this way.

286
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,480
If you go that way,
you'll probably die.

287
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,280
The OG is back.

288
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,920
She's trying to draw you to her.

289
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Why?

290
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,800
Do I look like the president
of the Poison Ivy fan club?

291
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,160
I don't know.

292
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,240
But I do know that a world
with two of a kind never ends well.

293
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,080
Why don't you ask poor boring
Beth Kane.

294
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,120
Oh, that's right,
you can't because she's dead.

295
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,720
And that's why
I've been feeling this way?

296
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:14,480
Clearly, we have some sort of bond
and she's calling out to me.

297
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,600
Give me the keys.

298
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,280
Were you not listening
to anything I said?

299
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
I am going, Alice.

300
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,640
This is the woman
who unlocked my prowess.

301
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,840
And the reason
why I'm finally happy.

302
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,680
The least I can do is go
and see what she wants, right?

303
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Fine.

304
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,160
Let's go meet your maker.

305
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Tequila?

306
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,240
Is this the part where I say yes
and you pass it to Luke?

307
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,480
It's where I thank you
for grabbing my bat suit

308
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,760
while your car
was being sucked into the abyss.

309
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,320
You're a bad ass.

310
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,240
Can I ask you something?

311
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,920
What's your problem with me?

312
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,360
Hey, I haven't brought up Renee once
since we got here.

313
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,880
I'm not talking about Renee.

314
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,400
And you can pretend all you want

315
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,840
that our problems started
when she came into our lives

316
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,080
but it's been like this
since the beginning.

317
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,680
Hey. You mean back when you
thought I was a common criminal.

318
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Is that why you don't like me?

319
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,080
I have apologized.

320
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,320
I've changed.

321
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,960
Ryan, I literally quit my job

322
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,360
in part because of this relationship
and what I've learned from you.

323
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,560
I'm trying, okay?

324
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,280
But I'm not getting anything
in return.

325
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,640
What do you want in return?

326
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,880
What do you want?

327
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,120
Look, no offense

328
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,840
but, Sophie, I have so much going on
in my head right now.

329
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,440
I don't know what I want.

330
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,920
You think?

331
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,800
Half the time I don't know
if you like me or hate me.

332
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
And honestly,
I think you're just afraid.

333
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,680
Afraid of what?

334
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,360
Of feeling something real
and blowing it.

335
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,520
So what is it? What do you want?

336
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Move.

337
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,520
- What?
- Move.

338
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,640
Salt and vinegar.

339
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,920
Why are we whispering?

340
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,720
Imagine of each of the trillion
spores in these woods

341
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,680
as one of Poison Ivy's
sensory glands.

342
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,640
She can sense sound vibrations.

343
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,600
Yeah. So between the hammering
and the arguing.

344
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,200
We drew her right to us.

345
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,960
Well, game on, bitch.

346
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,280
Load up two more of those,
we're going on a Poison Ivy hunt.

347
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,280
I wish I could, but unfortunately,
that was the last of the salt.

348
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Wait, actually, that's not true.

349
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,720
I saw a bag of ice melt
in the truck in the driveway.

350
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,720
The truck in the driveway outside.
Out there.

351
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,920
On the other side of these walls.

352
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Or we can just stay cooped up in here

353
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,600
and second-guess each other to death.

354
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,840
Save Pam the effort.

355
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,640
Okay. We could draw straws
to see who goes?

356
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,520
I'll save us the trouble.

357
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,960
I'm Batwoman. I'll go.

358
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,400
She's close.

359
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,440
I can feel her warm pull.

360
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,960
What are you doing?

361
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,720
Well, she named herself Poison Ivy.

362
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,280
Why not Delicate Lilac
or Dainty Lilly?

363
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,000
Maybe because she's a mass murderer.

364
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,840
Alice, you're not tire-ironing the
woman responsible for my awakening.

365
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,400
Look, I get this whole bone
of my bone, flesh of my flesh thing

366
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
that's happening right now.

367
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,120
But this is an ending
with the two of you

368
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,280
winding your little vines together
making a peace wreath.

369
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,600
Are you jealous?

370
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,680
What is happening here?

371
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,160
What are you so worried about?

372
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,640
You ending up dead.

373
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,920
Because the tickets to Santorini
are in your name

374
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,240
and if you die,
I will miss out on a spa retreat, so.

375
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,400
Why do we work, Alice?

376
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,240
You killed my mom.

377
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,280
I replaced you in our family.

378
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
But...

379
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,280
here we are on this crazy adventure
together, why?

380
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,760
Probably because you made me drive
out to your deliverance country.

381
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,600
It's because despite
all of our baggage...

382
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,160
we both found the sister
we always wanted.

383
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,760
I see the girl
who just craves her freedom.

384
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,720
And I love that you support me
to do what I want.

385
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,640
And this is what I want.

386
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,400
I hate to have to pull this card,
sis, but tough beans.

387
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,800
- I'm older.
- Alice, stop.

388
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,840
What are you doing?

389
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,160
You're staying right here.

390
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,280
I'm going alone.

391
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,320
And you're not gonna stop me.

392
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Nighty night.

393
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,520
Finally making yourself useful.

394
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,560
Well, they had no Bordeaux
in that mini fridge over there.

395
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,760
Let's see if she has an opener
around here.

396
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,360
So how'd she find you?

397
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Your daughter.

398
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Daughter?

399
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,800
I've never actually heard her
described to me that way.

400
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,200
Well, do you mind me asking

401
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,000
what's keeping you
from treating her that way?

402
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,280
Look at me, John.

403
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,400
I just broke into City Hall
to find a way to keep my son

404
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,200
from becoming another monster
on the cork board.

405
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,000
The closer I get to Ryan, the faster
she becomes a potential victim.

406
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,600
And yet you smiled just now
when I brought up her name.

407
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I actually don't know
how she found me.

408
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
But...

409
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,880
maybe there is a part of me
that's happy that she did.

410
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,840
Well, maybe.

411
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,240
Hear me out of here.

412
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
Just maybe.

413
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,560
If you drop your guard for a minute

414
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,320
and open yourself up
to other possibilities.

415
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,920
That thing you thought
would be your worst nightmare

416
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,720
might just be the best thing
to ever happen to you, Jada.

417
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,480
Forget that beer, John.

418
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,840
We're gonna need that Bordeaux
after all.

419
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,480
We're celebrating.

420
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,200
Hey, where's Pam?

421
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,120
I can't let you find her.

422
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
Good luck.

423
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,240
Here I am, trying to teach
you an important life skill.

424
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,960
And you're more interested
in my phone.

425
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,640
Mommy said we have to make memories.

426
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Memories, bud.

427
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,800
But your mother is right.

428
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,640
As always.

429
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Hey.

430
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,240
Stay where you are.

431
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Hey.

432
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Hello?

433
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,720
What the hell happened to you, girl?

434
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,880
Get away from me.

435
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,800
Dad!

436
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,600
What is she doing?

437
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,640
Her damn arms aren't long enough.

438
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,960
<i>I can hear you.</i>

439
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,960
I can't watch.

440
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,760
<i>If you could grab both,
that would be even better.</i>

441
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
You grab both.

442
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,560
Okay, one it is.

443
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,080
What in the actual hell?

444
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,360
Batwoman, help!

445
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Oh, my God.

446
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,560
Run!

447
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,320
<i>Luke, get ready to run.</i>

448
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,880
<i>- Sophie, I need you.</i>
- Talk to me.

449
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,560
- Blow up the truck.
- What?

450
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,360
You asked me what I wanted?
Blow up the truck!

451
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,480
The suit will protect me.

452
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,800
- We don't know that.
- Blow up the damn truck!

453
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,000
How the hell am I suppose...

454
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,400
Shoot it, hot shot.

455
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,320
You good?

456
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,760
You saved me.

457
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Here you go.

458
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Hey.

459
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,560
The park rangers
are looking for your dad.

460
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,800
And they're gonna find him, okay?

461
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,720
Sophie, checking in. Any sign of her?

462
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Ryan.

463
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Ryan.

464
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,600
Luke, I found her. She's alive.

465
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,360
I'm okay. I'm fine.

466
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Fine?

467
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,640
That's all you have to say?

468
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,600
You almost died.

469
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,360
She's too strong for us.

470
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,040
We need to make it home.

471
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,000
Make a replica of Luke's gun
and find some more of that serum.

472
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,640
Ryan, look at me.

473
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,320
Never put me in that position again.

474
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,640
It stopped her, didn't it?

475
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
- You could have died.
- But I didn't.

476
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,120
- But you could have.
- Oh, well.

477
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,440
What? Ryan, no.

478
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,360
You don't get to,
oh, well me and walk away.

479
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,360
What is going on with you?

480
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,040
I'm freaking exhausted, Sophie.

481
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,400
You wanna know what I want?

482
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,040
I want to sleep.

483
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,600
That's what I want.

484
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,160
I have a family, I didn't ask
for trying to destroy my city.

485
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,480
My best friend is off the grid

486
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,920
because I've been so preoccupied.

487
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,040
I didn't notice
she was an entirely different person

488
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,400
and now a Batman supervillain
just kicked all of our asses.

489
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,840
So, yeah, the thought of blowing up
in a fiery explosion

490
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,680
honestly sounds like a vacation
to me...

491
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,080
Maybe that will get you
out of your head.

492
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,000
Where are you going?

493
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,240
To look for my damn car.

494
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Okay then.

495
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,720
A friend of mine told me
this worked for her

496
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,360
so I figured, what the hell.

497
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Look, Dad...

498
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,880
I get why you don't think
I'm ready to be Batwing.

499
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,200
Because you and I
and a whole lot of O.R. doctors

500
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,520
know that I'm not even supposed
to be here right now.

501
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,840
I'm supposed to be on ground
next to you

502
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,600
with a severed vein
and three ruptured organs.

503
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,600
But thanks to some lucky,
impossible, freak miracle, I'm not.

504
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
I'm still here.

505
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
But what if...

506
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,800
what if it wasn't a freak miracle?

507
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,600
What if your death
wasn't a tragedy?

508
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,600
What if all these horrible things
that happened to me

509
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,880
happened for a reason?

510
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,960
Because that's what
I'm trying to think.

511
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
And...

512
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,080
as hard as it is to say...

513
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,160
I can't keep caring
about what you would think

514
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,200
because, Dad, I'm ready.

515
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,800
And I love you and I miss you but...

516
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,560
I can't let you hold me back anymore.

517
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,200
You father would be proud of you.

518
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,240
Sorry, man.

519
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,920
I tried but I can't get it open.

520
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,080
Oh, damn it.

521
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,280
Got that same line from ARGUS.

522
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,800
Figured I had a fighting chance
with your Bat tech.

523
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,560
To be honest,
I don't actually have access

524
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,800
to our best resources
at the moment.

525
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,840
But from what I can tell,
the technology used

526
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,760
on a "Transmatter Cube"

527
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,040
probably
isn't from around here, is it?

528
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,480
Which is why I'd appreciate you
keeping this between us.

529
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,040
How did you get it open last time?

530
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
That's the problem.

531
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
I didn't do anything.
It just opened for me.

532
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,960
So maybe the key to opening that box

533
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,480
isn't based on science,
human or otherwise.

534
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,840
Maybe it's something else entirely.

535
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
Yeah.

536
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
Yeah.

537
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,840
I need you to do one more favor
for me.

538
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,320
- Okay. What's that?
- Get a message to Batwoman.

539
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,600
Let her know that
Jada Jet found a fix.

540
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,120
She's ready to save her son.

541
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,320
Since when is it day?

542
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
<i>What happened to you girl?</i>

543
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
<i>Get away from me.</i>

544
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
<i>Dad!</i>

545
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,040
Oh, little sister,
what have you done?

546
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,720
Let's just call this what it is.

547
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,960
A toxic relationship.

548
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,200
How are you here?

549
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,240
I, I...

550
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,760
Pheromone'd my ass?

551
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,040
I know, I was there.

552
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,160
When I thought there was a chance
I'd see you again, I created a toxin.

553
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,680
Started ingesting a drop a day

554
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,880
hoping to build up a tolerance
to your mind-control.

555
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
I guess you could say
I was afraid you'd do exactly

556
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,440
what you ended up doing.

557
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,680
You don't love me.

558
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,640
I do love you, Pam

559
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,640
I just don't love you
the way you want me to love you.

560
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,120
Then that's not love.

561
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,200
It's judgment.

562
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,880
Maybe this is a toxic relationship.

563
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,760
I've seen addicts
wean themselves off of heroin faster

564
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,200
than what we're doing to each other.

565
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,600
What do you think kept me alive
for 10 years, Renee?

566
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,600
I had no water, no sunlight...

567
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,280
no human contact.

568
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,760
I thought I was going to die there.

569
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,680
So what single thought do you think
I held onto for every waking moment

570
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,640
of every brutal day?

571
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
You.

572
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,120
So, if loving you through everything
we've been through

573
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,880
is toxic, then fine.

574
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,640
We're toxic.

575
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Walk away.

576
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,640
But that doesn't mean
I'll ever let you go.

577
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
Your sporeling
is stronger than expected.

578
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,440
Are you gonna let me do this

579
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,680
or stand in our way?

580
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,280
You found me.

581
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
No.

582
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,840
You found me.
