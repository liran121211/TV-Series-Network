00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,440
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,880
Mr. Freeze's liquid nitrogen can

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,960
got in the hands of a bunch
of 8th graders.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,360
I need to find it.

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,640
Exposure to the freeze serum

6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,840
will stop time
and keep you from aging.

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,520
Gonna need a little help.

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,040
Batwoman!

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,360
Ryan, wake up!

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,080
Not much left but Renee
was willing to cross it off her list.

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,800
Guess it's safe to say
you figured out the glitches

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,600
- in your super suit.
- You could say that.

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,880
It's because he disabled
the failsafe.

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,240
I shouldn't have cleared you
for field duty.

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,720
If you continue to try to have
anything to do with my family

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,920
you and Wayne Enterprises will come
to severely regret that decision.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,160
Does that happen a lot?

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,760
Those delusions?

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,360
So you think you know my story.

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,560
Twenty-seven.

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,680
Raised in the system,
spend time at Blackgate.

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,160
Oh, and you're my sister.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,360
Subject FXJ-1, re-animation
progress check, final phase.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,560
You're free to go.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,280
Re-animation failure,
24 hours until client deadline.

26
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,640
What the hell?

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,840
When did it get here?

28
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,760
Tragically early.
Delivery dude woke me out of bed.

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,760
Okay. Yeah. This is bad.

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,200
Yeah, but the picture's kind of cute.

31
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,880
<i>Thirty Under Thirty.</i> Yours truly?

32
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,120
I mean, I need to hang this up.

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
- Give me the note.
- Here.

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,640
<i>You're welcome, fam.</i>

35
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,240
{\an5}<i>See you at the press junket.
Marquis.</i>

36
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,920
{\an5}Your brother got you on the list?

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
{\an5}First of all, I'm a rising star.

38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,560
{\an5}But also he used to hook up
with the editor of <i>The Gazette,</i> so...

39
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,000
{\an5}So you now have a public date,
in front of the cameras

40
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,720
{\an5}with the brother that
you have to stay away from

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,320
{\an5}otherwise Jada Jet comes knives
out for you, Wayne Enterprises

42
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,640
{\an5}maybe even your secret identity.

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,320
{\an5}I tried to ghost him, okay?

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
{\an5}But the word is out,
and Gotham is curious.

45
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,640
You know Charlie Clarke, right?

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,200
{\an5}- Head of PR for Wayne?
- Yeah, of course.

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,320
{\an5}Charlie has been with Wayne
since my dad was still there.

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
He is one of Bruce's
inner circle guys.

49
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,520
{\an5}Okay, well, Charlie
has gotten dozens of requests

50
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,960
{\an5}to interview Wayne's hot young CEO,
their words, not mine

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,800
and he says that
if I skip on this event

52
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,520
{\an5}we're gonna have reporters trying
to climb the walls of Wayne Tower

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
to get answers.

54
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,920
Okay.

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
{\an5}What's your plan for
when you run into Marquis?

56
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,000
Feel the shoulder.

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,520
Come on, feel it.

58
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,600
- Cold as they come.
- Okay.

59
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,600
Look, if I need a convo blocker,
Sophie's gonna be there.

60
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,160
Her sister is on the list
for the community center.

61
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,400
Oh, that is legitimately cool.

62
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,200
{\an5}Great, you both are here.

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,520
{\an5}Can I run something crazy by you?

64
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,840
{\an5}My sweet girl, did you go home
with a boy last night?

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,840
No, see that's the thing.

66
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,800
{\an5}I'm pretty sure
I spent the night asleep on a bench

67
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,320
in the middle of Gotham Park.

68
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,760
{\an5}So, busy morning. I should jet.

69
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,600
Pun intended. Good luck.

70
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,920
{\an5}Would Luke still be this upset
if nothing was actually wrong?

71
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,880
{\an5}Luke is just frustrated.

72
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,040
{\an5}You told me his PTSD
made him a risk in the field.

73
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,000
{\an5}He just wants us to be able
to know we can depend on him.

74
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
{\an5}Depend on him?

75
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,120
{\an5}You mean like when you walk
into a room and say

76
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
{\an5}"Hey, something really weird
just happened to me.

77
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,400
{\an5}Can we talk about it?"

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,840
{\an5}He'll come around, okay?

79
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,360
{\an5}But I'm here to listen.

80
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,120
{\an5}I have a jam-packed day.
So can we walk and talk?

81
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Please?

82
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,800
{\an5}Then we should just table my drama

83
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,640
because I sort of need
an active listener here.

84
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,240
Okay. How about this?

85
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,840
{\an5}I'll buy drinks for happy hour,
then you can unload?

86
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,720
{\an5}Sure, I'll just journal until then.

87
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,920
All right. Just breathe.

88
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,680
It's not like you're in
Norman Bates' psych wards

89
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,840
with a billion non-consensual
nanobots

90
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,360
swimming through your bloodstream.

91
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Oh, wait.

92
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,480
You've got mail.

93
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,680
I hate that I'm old enough
to know what you did there.

94
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,200
It's from Daddy.

95
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,320
They all are.

96
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,000
An entire stack from old jail crow
Jacob Kane.

97
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
These misdeliveries
are from the weepy Post Office

98
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,760
inside my sick mind.

99
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,680
Now that sounds like a you problem.

100
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Excuse me?

101
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,000
Help?

102
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,200
Kane?

103
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,400
What's the problem?

104
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,280
Everything looks normal to you?

105
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,320
Room inspections are Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

106
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,280
- What?
- I...

107
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,800
Just one more thing.

108
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,960
I really need to speak
with Renee Montoya.

109
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
Let's keep things moving, Charlie.

110
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,800
I want to make an impression,
and then leave them wanting more.

111
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,840
Great news,
the Chairman of Apex Broadcasting

112
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,640
got an eel bone stuck in his throat

113
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,800
so there is a photo session
slot available.

114
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Lead the way.

115
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,360
Wayne Enterprises is set

116
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,000
to make its biggest quarterly
revenue gains in six years.

117
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,800
I had to bribe Mr. Wayne
with Bloody Marys

118
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,000
just to get him
to memorize his talking points.

119
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,160
- Ryan.
- Ryan, over here.

120
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,920
Over here.

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
Miss Wilder.

122
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,040
Ryan, over here.

123
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Over here. Ryan, over here.

124
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,400
You wanna let me work?

125
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,680
I can barely tell you're smiling.

126
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,560
Come on, show Gotham
that new fire that's taking over.

127
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,480
- Ms. Wilder.
- Ryan.

128
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,080
Thank you so much.
Isn't she wonderful, folks?

129
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,240
That's Marquis Jet.

130
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,000
I want the cameras
to get a shot of you together.

131
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,560
The Jets are icons in this city.

132
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,720
Why are you avoiding me?

133
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,680
I thought that
once I got you on this list

134
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,800
you knew what I wanted...

135
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,240
- To piss off your mom?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm just making up
for the missed time

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
you had with our mom
and the rebellious phase.

138
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,880
It's manipulative, and frankly,
it puts my business at risk.

139
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,520
- Look, Ryan...
- Hey, guys, can I get a smile?

140
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,480
I will be real with you.

141
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,840
I just wanted to do a nice thing

142
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,720
and hopefully have a chance
to hang out with my sister

143
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,080
but if that's too risky for you...

144
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,840
You're off the hook.

145
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,160
I gotta take this.

146
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,040
This is like the publicist
<i>Hunger Games.</i>

147
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,040
Did you see the sign at the bar
that says the free champagne

148
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,080
is for nominees only?

149
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,320
You want me to get you a glass

150
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,960
you should've bought me that
box of wine I wanted in college.

151
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,680
Okay, as your big sister,
I stand behind that decision.

152
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,320
It's as on-brand for me as being
here today is off-brand for you.

153
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,560
As an honoree, I get
a little speech at the party later.

154
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,240
Two minutes, anything I want to say.

155
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,520
My plan is to serenade
these moneybags

156
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,120
into quadrupling
the community center's budget.

157
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
It's a once-in-a-lifetime shot,
right?

158
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,360
That's my <i>Under 30</i> bestie.

159
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,120
Always got her eye
on the prize and...

160
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,720
It must run in the family.

161
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,520
I have something embarrassing
to tell you.

162
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,160
I am so in.

163
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,120
- I had a dream about Ryan.
- Okay.

164
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
- I was in bed...
- Okay.

165
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,240
and I must have been sick
because she brought me some soup.

166
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,480
What kind of soup?

167
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,400
I woke up before I could even try it.

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,200
What?

169
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,760
You woke up early,
it's a classic dream about longing.

170
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,360
I knew you really liked her.

171
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,680
Why did I tell you this?

172
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay, Jordan,
it wasn't a sexual dream, at all.

173
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,120
Did Ryan bring up a flower
with the soup?

174
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,080
- Told you.
- Okay.

175
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,320
I'm 31, I have no career

176
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,040
and I'm surrounded
by all you sick little prodigies

177
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,000
and my brain is begging me

178
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,640
"Hey, loser,
can you at least find a girlfriend?"

179
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
But that doesn't mean
it has to be Ryan.

180
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,280
Or, and hear me out on this.

181
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,160
Ryan Wilder is hot as hell,
and you're amazing together.

182
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,240
You're staring again. I just...

183
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,400
You know what? I have to go.
I'll be right back

184
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,960
- To the bathroom?
- Just worry about your speech.

185
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,520
Jordan Moore? I'm from <i>The Gazette.</i>

186
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
We're ready
to sit for your interview.

187
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,040
Okay, sure, let me just grab
my publicist.

188
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,760
- That won't be necessary.
- Hey...

189
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,960
<i>Vesper Fairchild is holding.</i>

190
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,200
Vesper, it's Jada.

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,640
I happened to glance
at last week's ratings, ouch.

192
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,400
It's a crowded landscape, my dear.

193
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,200
But I want to help you
make some noise.

194
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
Yes, I have a scoop.

195
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,800
Explain this new hobby to me.

196
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,760
Only if you explain why Montoya
dropped you off for me to babysit.

197
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,360
I have urgent information
to help Batwoman recover

198
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,680
the infamous "zero-G sneakers."

199
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,800
Used by Batman's long-ago fallen

200
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,840
and tragically arrogant foe,
the Mighty Icarus!

201
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,320
Icarus?

202
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,600
Sounds like a deep cut.

203
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,120
Actually, it's fake,
but she'll believe anything

204
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,920
if you lower your voice an octave.

205
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
It's convincing, right?

206
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,240
Convince me not to tell Montoya
that there is no Mighty Icarus.

207
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,840
Well for one, you're lonely.

208
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,280
Well then maybe we could do
each other's nails

209
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,800
or try a few elective surgeries.

210
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,120
There has to be some reason
why you're playing hooky from Arkham.

211
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,240
Well, I hate to admit anything
that would make me sound weak

212
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,600
but the truth is...

213
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,840
I'm here to do Batwoman a favor.

214
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,120
Well, keep going, so far this story
is better than your nanobot cold.

215
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,760
First things first,
can you tell me what trophy

216
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,800
the Bat Team
is heroically tracking down

217
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,840
at this very moment
to keep the Gotham streets safe

218
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,640
and appease the tyrant
that is forcing us to work together?

219
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Something came up.

220
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,680
We'll get back
to Renee's treasure hunt tomorrow.

221
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,200
No judgment here

222
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,760
but I wonder if Renee
would be as generous

223
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,520
toward this work-life balance?

224
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,240
I guess you'll find out
when you call her.

225
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,440
Fine, you win.

226
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,360
Just don't bother anyone
who comes in.

227
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,440
I can't believe
you've never had media training.

228
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,680
Just highly motivated. Who's next?

229
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,400
Let me shoot <i>The Gazette</i>
a quick text

230
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,320
and see if they're ready for you.

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,880
Figured you'd chill
if I bought a disguise

232
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,200
so they had this sick colorway
at the gift shop.

233
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,520
"Who's that man with Ryan Wilder?

234
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,880
Is he handsome?

235
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,000
I can't tell!"

236
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,640
Yeah, you probably
should have got some aviators.

237
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,520
I should've. They're two for one.

238
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,680
You want in?

239
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,200
Hey, Ryan, have you seen Jordan?

240
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,320
She's late for an interview,
and her phone is off.

241
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,640
Never let the client
out of your sight.

242
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,760
I'm more publisister
than publicist, so...

243
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,280
I would've guessed print model.

244
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,560
Cool hat.

245
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
Marquis Jet. I'm Ryan's brother.

246
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,960
Sophie Moore. Ryan's...

247
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Very good friend who needs help
finding her baby sister.

248
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,360
<i>The Gazette</i> says
they're ready for you.

249
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,720
Can we push this off
until after the interview?

250
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,880
My girl comes first.

251
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,440
See if that dude got rid
of the eel bone yet.

252
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Come on, let's go.

253
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,560
Okay. Re-booting voice interface.

254
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,640
Re-booting system loader.

255
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,120
Dad? It's Luke. Are you there?

256
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,280
The silent treatment is getting old.

257
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,800
Are you really gonna leave me hanging
with the most sophisticated

258
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,520
personal flight suit on the planet?

259
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,080
Is this about the failsafe?

260
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,280
You're mad because I turned it off?

261
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,960
Because that's on you,
it malfunctioned, so...

262
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,200
You know, and also
almost got me killed, so, no.

263
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,520
I'm not turning it back on.

264
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,440
My suit, my decision.

265
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,160
<i>Batwoman to Batcave. You there?</i>

266
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,240
Yup, just talking to my wardrobe,
having a normal one.

267
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,160
Batwoman, hey.

268
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,840
I thought you were taking
a personal day?

269
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,960
I need an assist.

270
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,280
Sophie's sister Jordan is MIA.

271
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,000
<i>Too many mai tais at the open bar?</i>

272
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,760
I hope not. I cleaned up
enough puke at my old job.

273
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,280
<i>I got a ping from her cellphone.</i>

274
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,320
Let me just narrow down
the location radius

275
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,600
with the hotel Wi-Fi.

276
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,680
Not to be a downer at a party
but it might be time to panic.

277
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,080
Was something going on with her?

278
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,200
She seemed nervous, but only
because she had a speech later.

279
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,040
<i>Facial recognition says no Jordan
on any of the exterior hotel cams.</i>

280
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,040
<i>So she must still be on the premises.</i>

281
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,240
Hey, I just got a tip
that your sister was spotted

282
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,440
upstairs at the hotel.

283
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,880
Some man brought her to room 1620.

284
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,040
Let's go.

285
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay, you stay here. Keep an eye out.

286
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,600
Call me if she comes back down.

287
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,320
Jordan? Oh, my God.

288
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,080
No, don't touch her,
not until we know what happened.

289
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,640
Who the hell would do this to her?

290
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,240
I've seen this equipment before.

291
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
This is Mr. Fries' design.

292
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,560
Freeze serum did this?

293
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,640
I thought you said you got
that stuff off the streets.

294
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,760
I got the original canister back,
but maybe someone found more?

295
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
Why would they do this to Jordan?

296
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,440
And how are they doing this
without a cryo chamber?

297
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,360
You know what, I'll handle it.

298
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,600
- I have to move her...
- You cannot warm her, Sophie.

299
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,800
It's too dangerous.

300
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,280
The last time someone tried that

301
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,080
she aged at four times
the normal rate.

302
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,840
This is my sister, Ryan.
She's my responsibility.

303
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,160
I know.

304
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,120
We will figure this out together.

305
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,160
The catalytic mechanism is based
on Victor Fries' research

306
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,160
but what used to happen
inside a chamber

307
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,400
is now happening
inside Jordan's cells.

308
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,680
I just wanna know how to undo it.

309
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,040
Tell me how to help.

310
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,560
The main complication that we've seen

311
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,600
with Fries' cryo-stasis
is rapid aging.

312
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,360
But this is so much more invasive.

313
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,320
If I had to guess what this could do
to organic tissue?

314
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,240
Have you ever seen a piece
of petrified wood before?

315
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,520
We should just pause on that analogy
and just focus. What do you need?

316
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,320
Want me to go to the store
for a hairdryer?

317
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,360
Why the hell is Alice even here?

318
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,800
It's really
not even worth explaining.

319
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,040
Look, if I can get a clean sample
of this new freeze serum

320
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,800
I think I could figure out a safe way
to bring Jordan out of cryo.

321
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,520
Then we should find out who made it
and see if they have more.

322
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,320
Were they working with anyone
at the hotel?

323
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,720
Or with the event?

324
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,760
We should have Luke check
every camera system

325
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,600
- to see if he can pull...
- I got it.

326
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,040
It's the Bee Gees.

327
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,000
Of course, it's them.

328
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,760
Did you take my sister's phone?

329
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,080
Oh, yeah. And you're welcome.

330
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,000
For critiquing her taste in music?

331
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,360
No.

332
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,600
For solving
all your little mysteries.

333
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,760
Who kidnapped Jordan.

334
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,680
Who's experimenting
with the freeze formula.

335
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,800
Same answer.

336
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,000
The Black Glove Society.

337
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,320
The BGS.

338
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
The Bee Gees.

339
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,400
They rule the city from the shadows,
they want to live forever.

340
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,000
You know, the usual
big-money pervert stuff.

341
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,080
She's right.

342
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,320
Jordan and her friends
were collecting information

343
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,800
on some Black Glove Society.

344
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,840
She was going to use her speech
at the <i>30 Under 30</i>

345
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,160
to unmask the society
and shut it down.

346
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,840
Now that is a great way
to make yourself a target

347
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,800
of Gotham's oldest secret society
of the rich and powerful.

348
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,400
I'll send this info to Luke
so he can check on the others

349
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,760
to see if they're okay.

350
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,920
Why didn't you tell me
what you were doing?

351
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,280
You? Special Agent Play-It-Safe?

352
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,480
She knew you'd try to talk her
out of it.

353
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,200
Mary, I don't think her temperature
is stable.

354
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,120
You're right.

355
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,320
The formula must be breaking down
inside of her body.

356
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,240
If I could just get a sample
of this formula

357
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,800
I can figure all of this out.

358
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,320
It's too bad we can't just ask her
on how to find the Bee Gees.

359
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,520
She was obviously close enough
to something

360
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,920
for them to turn her into a popsicle.

361
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,960
- Alice, you're coming with me.
- Where are you going?

362
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,600
I can't just wait for Ryan
to solve this for me.

363
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,280
We're gonna search
Jordan's apartment.

364
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,240
If she's got any other evidence
on Black Glove

365
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,760
it'll be hidden there.

366
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,600
I just got the Black Glove files
from Sophie.

367
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,720
Give me one second to see
what Jordan had on here.

368
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,240
Nothing they do is digital.

369
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,760
Maybe that's how
they stay off the radar.

370
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,240
<i>No computers, nothing on the cloud...</i>

371
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,040
Nothing we can use
to get a name or location?

372
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,760
What about the people Jordan
was texting earlier?

373
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,040
MIA. They all met at the hotel.
But then they all went dark.

374
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,320
<i>I bet that's why Black Glove does
the freeze experiments at the hotel.</i>

375
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
You know, one-stop shopping everyone
who has it out for them.

376
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,520
Oh, my God.

377
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,000
The coroner's taking someone
out of the hotel in pieces.

378
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,240
Probably one of Jordan's team.

379
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,640
Okay.

380
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,240
I'm going up to the hotel.

381
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,640
We gotta find the other one.

382
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,480
Did you have eyes on Marquis

383
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,000
around the time
that Jordan went missing?

384
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,360
- Why?
- BGS is big money.

385
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,480
You know, flashy guys doing
whatever it takes to stay powerful.

386
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,960
<i>He would fit perfectly
into that crowd.</i>

387
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,360
Find your friend's sister?

388
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,480
Yeah, I did. Thanks.

389
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,320
Right where you said she'd be.

390
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,880
I'm glad I could be of service.

391
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,080
I bet he is.

392
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
How did he know which room
Jordan was in in the first place?

393
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
How did you know where to find her?

394
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,240
I know a girl who works
at the front desk.

395
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,760
She asked around for me.

396
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,680
One of the housekeepers said
that she saw someone

397
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,680
who looked like Jordan
being led into a bedroom

398
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,880
by some older guy.

399
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,800
I'm not accusing you. Okay?

400
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,800
But like I said,
I don't really know you, Marquis.

401
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,920
- I actually came to apologize.
- For what?

402
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,280
You think Jada's crazy, angry,
control freak thing is something new?

403
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,000
This has been my whole life.

404
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,400
Only child.

405
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,720
I wanted to know you so bad.

406
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,960
And I thought, finally, my sister,
we got each other's backs.

407
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,520
But I guess not.

408
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,600
<i>What the hell was that all about?</i>

409
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,920
I'll figure it out
after we help Jordan.

410
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,360
Is your phone seriously
not on right now?

411
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,360
Charlie, sorry, she's on silent.

412
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,600
Look, I just ran into some movers
and shakers at the hotel

413
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,320
so I gotta get back to it, okay?

414
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,480
Look.

415
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,560
<i>Ryan, why is he so pissed?</i>

416
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,160
Built you up just so
I can knock you down.

417
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,680
Okay. Better give me
the executive summary.

418
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,280
Five minutes ago, Vesper Fairchild
broke a scoop

419
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,680
that the CEO of Wayne Enterprises
has been diverting

420
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,360
tens of millions of dollars
into secret accounts for her own use.

421
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,840
Jada...

422
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,520
I just got off the phone
with our CFO.

423
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,720
He's started doing an audit
of our accounting systems

424
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,560
and he agrees that there's a problem.

425
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,840
What? No.

426
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,360
It's not possible.

427
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,640
Okay, look. I will talk to him
and sort this out.

428
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,800
But just not right now.

429
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,360
Oh, do you have
a more desperate crisis?

430
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,720
They say multitasking
is the hardest part of the job.

431
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,120
Not for much longer.

432
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,520
Okay. Don't worry.

433
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,840
I will get a box
for my personal belongings.

434
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,120
Girl, when you catch Bernie Madoff,
in this case, you, stealing money

435
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,480
you don't fire her.

436
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,720
You arrest her.

437
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,800
Tell me something good, Luke.

438
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,840
Maybe, like, Jada Jet
hacked our systems

439
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,400
and faked all that hidden money.

440
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,040
Ryan, she didn't fake this.

441
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,880
Why am I the last person to know
that I have eight figures stashed

442
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,240
under a mattress somewhere?

443
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,080
<i>Can you think of any operations that
are extremely expensive, secretive</i>

444
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,920
and can only be authorized
by the CEO of Wayne Enterprises?

445
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,000
Batman. And now, Batwoman.

446
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,840
That money is our operating budget.

447
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,520
Look, I have no idea
how Jada got access

448
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,080
to our accounting systems, so...

449
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,520
The only good news is she
doesn't know what the money is for.

450
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,840
Just that she can pin it on you.

451
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,960
Luke, I give up.

452
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
There's nothing here.

453
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,480
The cops could walk in any second
and I'm freezing my ass off.

454
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,960
GCPD has thermal imaging cameras
all over the city.

455
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,720
Let me tap in
and see if any of the other rooms

456
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,080
have abnormal temperatures.

457
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,800
<i>I'm not seeing any iceboxes.</i>

458
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,200
Luke...

459
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,040
I'm seeing
a bunch of heat lamps here.

460
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,520
Maybe they were getting ready
to try thawing her?

461
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,200
<i>If they did that in another room...</i>

462
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,480
Then on thermal imaging,
it would look more like a sauna.

463
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Okay, bingo. Get ready to suit up.

464
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,080
<i>What's the situation?</i>

465
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,960
Dead body.

466
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,440
They tried to unfreeze it.
Didn't work.

467
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,760
Positive ID. She's the other one
in Jordan's group text.

468
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,200
No sign of Black Glove.

469
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,200
Okay, I just ran the name
of the other guy in the group text.

470
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,080
<i>According to the GCPD, he was the one
they just wheeled out of there.</i>

471
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,280
<i>Jordan's the only one left.</i>

472
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,920
Hey, no sass. You lived in the sewer.

473
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,000
I'll take the bedroom.

474
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,920
Remember,
we're looking for anything low tech.

475
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
Anything connected to Black Glove.

476
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,360
Jordan knew it was dangerous,
so it won't be out in the open.

477
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,080
You shouldn't be here.

478
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,600
How's your neck?

479
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
That's hurtful.

480
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,000
Are you talking to someone?

481
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,720
Oh, no.

482
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,120
No, I just like
to say the details out loud.

483
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,040
Please respect my process
and go back to digging

484
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,000
through your sister's underwear
drawer or something

485
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,360
Go, go.

486
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,520
You want my two cents?

487
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,720
First of all, they're my two cents.

488
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,840
Second of all, shut up. I'm working.

489
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,160
You don't wanna read
those postcards.

490
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,120
You don't like
feeling those little machines

491
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,120
swimming around in you like guppies.

492
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,880
You broke my damn neck.

493
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,520
I'm sorry.

494
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,560
Do I seem a teensy bit on edge?

495
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,120
It's only because the fabric of
my reality is collapsing around me.

496
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,680
Are you sure
you're keeping it together in there?

497
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,360
Oh, yeah.

498
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,040
You know, just overcoming the mold
of your sister's dusty manifesto.

499
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,880
Maybe if you knew
what was real about yourself, Beth...

500
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,840
the rest of the world
would fall back into place.

501
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,280
She unmasked the Bee Gees.

502
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,920
That doesn't belong to you.

503
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,440
Thanks for the warning.

504
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,360
Just taking a shot here.

505
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,680
Are you make-believe?

506
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,880
I'm here for everything that was
scanned into the girl's phone.

507
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,200
Pro-tip.

508
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,560
Buy a document shredder.

509
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
<i>What's up, Luke?</i>

510
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,120
You didn't give us an update
on your progress with Jordan.

511
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,080
Listen, I'm trying to keep her stable
until someone comes through

512
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,320
<i>with a sample of the formula.</i>

513
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,840
You've had her long enough
to analyze every angle

514
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,520
run every test,
and you've still got nothing?

515
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,400
No pressure, huh?

516
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,360
If you get to judge me for how
I'm performing in the clutch

517
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,960
why can't I do the same for you?

518
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,200
I was trying to help you.

519
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,520
Not score points in some
"who's the best hero" competition.

520
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,920
Look, I'm not dunking on you.

521
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,760
I'm just reminding you that
you declared yourself team doctor.

522
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,080
Yeah, and I'm trying.

523
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,320
But I can barely see straight

524
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,000
because I spent the night
in the park.

525
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,200
Which nobody knows about
because nobody actually cares...

526
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,920
What is it?

527
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,440
I can hear.
You just got an idea, right?

528
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,640
Animals never evolved
to withstand freezing

529
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,960
but plants have organic material

530
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
that perfectly adapted
to freezing and thawing.

531
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,920
<i>And they survive winter</i>

532
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,320
by synthesizing
a type of anti-freeze

533
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,480
inside their vascular tissue.

534
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,960
The key is to thaw from the inside,
not the outside.

535
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,160
And you think this could be a way
to safely unfreeze Jordan?

536
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,560
No, I just thought
it was a fun fact about plants.

537
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,320
What's that smell?

538
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,640
Gasoline.

539
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,760
Alice. Alice!

540
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
What?

541
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,360
It hurts a little on the nose
but the books are a nice touch.

542
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,240
Hey, where's your knife?

543
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,760
The Bee Gees took it.

544
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,920
Along with all the evidence I found
in Jordan's hidey-hole.

545
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,840
Stop trying to make Bee Gees happen.

546
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,880
Geez. Misdirected anger, much?

547
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,320
Misdirected?
This is completely your fault.

548
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,440
What?

549
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,960
You're Alice, a legit supervillain.

550
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,680
The only reason these guys jumped you

551
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,360
is because you thought
you were talking to some guy

552
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,560
who wasn't even there.

553
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,480
Yeah, I noticed.

554
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,600
Sometimes, I...

555
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,960
I'm not sure what's real
and what's not

556
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,240
and it used to only happen in Arkham

557
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,520
but it's getting worse
and I don't know what to do.

558
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,560
And I don't have anyone
who wants to help me.

559
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,240
Oh, that's one way
to solve my problem.

560
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,000
Sorry, Jordan.

561
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,920
Hey, how are you feeling?

562
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,600
I wish you had told me.

563
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,440
I could've helped.

564
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,720
I will always support you, Jordan.

565
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Always.

566
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,960
She'll need some more time
before she could talk again.

567
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,080
Her entire body is resetting.

568
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,280
I'm not gonna lie

569
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,080
she might smell like cilantro
for the next couple of days

570
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,560
but she's gonna make a full recovery.

571
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,360
Oh, thank goodness. Can we eat now?

572
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,480
I'm so sorry, Soph.

573
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,520
I said I'd handle this, and we still
don't know who these people are

574
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,200
or what they're doing
with the freeze serum.

575
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,320
Jordan's okay,
and that's all that matters.

576
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,400
So how did you know
to come to the apartment?

577
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,320
Luke figured out they were after
the original documents

578
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,720
Jordan had on her phone.

579
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,320
I'm not going to let Black Glove
get another shot at her.

580
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,840
Yeah, well, they almost burned me
at the stake.

581
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,000
So you're getting my help on this.

582
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,280
And Alice's too,
whether we want it or not.

583
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,200
Mary.

584
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,560
So Alice told me
her psychosis is getting worse

585
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,560
and she suspects
the doctors don't care.

586
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,040
Honestly?

587
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,680
It's Arkham.

588
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,520
Whatever meds
they're giving her in there

589
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,360
could be causing a psychotic break
instead of curing it.

590
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,120
It's going to be everyone's problem
if Alice fully loses her mind

591
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,360
before we finish the job for Montoya.

592
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,400
But, hypothetically, I could get
a supervised work release from Arkham

593
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,880
and sweet Mary could make sure
I was taking my proper meds.

594
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,320
I'm sure that Ry-Ry could convince
Renee-nay it was for the best.

595
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,880
You know, all for the sake
of "fighting crime."

596
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,400
Right, and who's going to put up
with that babysitting job?

597
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,200
Someone who sleeps with a gun
under her pillow.

598
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,000
What do you say? Roomies!

599
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,800
- How's the other crisis?
- Resolved.

600
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,160
So you'll be one-for-two today.

601
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
You might think you're here

602
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,400
to give me best practices
for a perp walk

603
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,280
but I'm not going anywhere.

604
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,160
I did nothing wrong.

605
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,880
Oh, I believe you.

606
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,160
You haven't been on the job
long enough to embezzle a stapler

607
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,680
let alone 30 million.

608
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,680
I think you made the wrong person
your enemy

609
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,000
and now you are the fall gal
for Bruce Wayne's misdeeds.

610
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,360
You think Bruce Wayne
stole from his own company?

611
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,760
Mr. Wayne's legacy
has been complicated

612
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,360
since he took over the company.

613
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,520
With his addictions, misbehaviors,
and disappearances, let's just say

614
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,520
I'm used to the challenge
of putting lipstick on a pig.

615
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,880
What's this?

616
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,880
Press release
that will go out in the morning.

617
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,960
After a thorough review, it was
determined that the "missing" money

618
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,720
was part of a top-secret
defense contract

619
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,520
that you negotiated with ARGUS.

620
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,880
CEO Wilder thought
no one could know about this

621
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,400
for national security reasons

622
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,240
and deeply regrets not alerting
the board of directors.

623
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
ARGUS is gonna go along
with the story?

624
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,720
I've got an old friend there.

625
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,000
He's doing me a favor.

626
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,800
Okay.

627
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,600
That's it? Crisis averted?

628
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,000
Unfortunately, no.

629
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,000
The stock price is still cratering

630
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,080
because someone
is coordinating a campaign

631
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,960
to undermine shareholder confidence.

632
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,240
If we don't do something
to restore confidence

633
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,720
we are at risk of a hostile takeover.

634
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,080
The board of directors
is demanding your resignation.

635
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,160
It is the best shot we have
at containing the crisis.

636
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,040
Okay, Charlie.

637
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,960
What do you think I should do?

638
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,360
That's up to you, Ms. Wilder.

639
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,200
But in my opinion

640
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,880
if you remain as CEO,
we will lose the company.

641
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,120
Well, we knew
she was capable of this.

642
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,320
Did we?

643
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,280
Because I'm not even clear why
the woman hates me so damn much.

644
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,520
I'm her daughter.

645
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,520
And I told you
that does not matter to her.

646
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,840
Okay, look...

647
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,360
Bruce was the face
of Wayne Enterprises

648
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,000
but my dad was his partner

649
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,400
and Bruce would always say
that the company belonged to Lucius

650
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,720
as much as it did him.

651
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,400
Ryan, I cannot lose this place.

652
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,680
You think I can?

653
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,080
What happens to Batwoman if there's
no cash to put gas in the Batmobile?

654
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,520
I am not letting Jada
take my calling.

655
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,200
So what, so even though
nobody thinks that you win

656
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,320
you're just gonna...

657
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,920
stay and fight?

658
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,680
Have you met me?

659
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,000
Okay.

660
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,960
Failsafe subroutine re-activated.

661
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,840
Now let's power cycle
the boot loader...

662
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,280
<i>It's good to see you again, son.</i>

663
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Dad?

664
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Oh, my God, I...

665
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,160
I really needed to hear your voice.

666
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,960
So the company's under attack

667
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,440
and I feel like
if we lose Wayne Enterprises

668
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,400
that's just another piece of you
that's gone from my life.

669
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,280
<i>Helping Wayne Enterprises is beyond
the scope of what I can help with.</i>

670
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,200
Yeah, I know,
we're already making a plan.

671
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,640
I just... I needed to know
why you stopped talking to me.

672
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,200
<i>You repaired the system fault
in the O.S.</i>

673
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,480
<i>that had been blocking this A.I.
from normal operation.</i>

674
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,800
I didn't repair anything.
I just turned the failsafe back on.

675
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,320
<i>Lucas, this A.I. is not designed
to run independent of the failsafe.</i>

676
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,800
<i>It has no purpose</i>

677
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,720
<i>if it's not empowered to act
in your best interest.</i>

678
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,040
Right, okay, so once a dad,
always a dad.

679
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,880
<i>What did you want to ask me?</i>

680
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,440
A friend of mine kind of already
gave me the answer, but...

681
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,040
I need to hear it
from the man himself.

682
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,760
I'm not ready to wear the suit, am I?

683
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,920
<i>No, son.</i>

684
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,840
<i>You're not.</i>

685
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
So why'd you had me meet you here?

686
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,480
Nothing left to lose?

687
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,320
Jada wants Wayne Enterprises,
doesn't she?

688
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Look...

689
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,480
I'm sorry
you had to face Jada's wrath

690
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,880
and that I had something
to do with that

691
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,440
but she's had me sign
a thousand NDAs over the years

692
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,120
so I can't really talk
about company business.

693
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,800
What happened to siblings
having each other's backs?

694
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,920
What happened was
you weren't interested.

695
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,680
I am not letting our mom
take over Wayne Enterprises.

696
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,560
Do you think the two of us
could stand a chance against Jada...

697
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,040
if we pledge to work together?

698
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,360
It's deadline day, my friend.
What do you have for me?

699
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,200
I have the answer
you've been searching for.

700
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,440
And it works the way I asked?

701
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,240
It wasn't an easy process, but yes.

702
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,720
We were able to adapt Victor Fries'
research into a new formula

703
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,840
that can safely freeze
and unfreeze organic material.

704
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,800
What made the process so difficult?

705
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,120
Our arrangement is that
Black Glove Society commissions us

706
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,920
to achieve the impossible

707
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
but our terms were non-negotiable,
you do not inquire about our methods

708
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,800
nor our identities.

709
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,080
You don't want to tell me
what lines you crossed

710
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,760
to achieve the impossible.

711
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,800
You want to know what line I crossed?

712
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,520
The final breakthrough
came from a rival research team.

713
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,880
I stole their idea.

714
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,360
As long as that's the extent of it,
I'm a very happy customer.

715
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,600
There's nothing wrong
with a little corporate espionage.

716
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,560
So now that you have the ability

717
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,400
to put anyone's life on pause
indefinitely...

718
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,280
you just give me the word
and I'll make it happen.

719
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,720
Oh, I will,
and it won't be a long wait.

720
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,920
The time has come for my son Marquis
to take his leave of absence.
