1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,600
Hey, what was that
with Ryan before?

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,960
- She didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,160
Doesn't matter.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,600
I'm Poison Ivy!

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,000
You killed someone, Mary.

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,440
You thought you just flung him
out of your way, but you didn't.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,560
He's dead.

9
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,320
Give me the buzzer.

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,920
I'll find a way to make it work.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,200
I want my son back in exchange.

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
Fine.

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,760
By midnight, or we have a problem.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,760
<i>Et tu, Batwoman?</i>

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,240
<i>Gothamites are reeling
from the revelation</i>

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,200
<i>that it was the Scarlet Knight
herself</i>

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,840
<i>who was responsible
for unleashing Bat-villain's past</i>

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
<i>on an unsuspecting G-town.</i>

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,040
<i>Thanks to business queen and Jada Jet
having blown the whistle</i>

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,040
<i>we now know that we have
the caped crusader to thank</i>

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,480
<i>for the recent spate of rogues
who had plagued the city.</i>

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,600
<i>And while it's unclear what prompted
Ms. Jet to be so catty towards Batty</i>

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,960
<i>I, for one, am dying to see
how this bat spat plays out.</i>

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,280
<i>Bat-bar to Batwoman.</i>

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,400
<i>When we diverted the water
from the dam to the sewers</i>

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,160
we didn't factor in Gotham's
crappy infrastructure.

27
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,080
- Bottomline it.
<i>- Clogged sewer backed up.</i>

28
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,160
It's flooding the area
around Mary's clinic.

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,040
<i>- If the water wakes up Marquis...</i>
- I'm on my way.

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, my God...

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,160
Nothing creepy about that.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,080
I don't know what's scarier

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,600
him being gone
or what he'd left behind.

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,160
<i>Now that I know who you are,
I know who I can hurt.</i>

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,960
<i>One by one.</i>

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,480
{\an5}It's all my fault.

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,000
We will get this cleaned up
as soon as we find Marquis.

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,480
{\an5}I'm not talking about the clinic.

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,920
I helped Pamela do this.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,440
I killed that man.

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,160
I told Marquis who you were.

42
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,160
It's okay.

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,560
No, it's not.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,600
He can tell everyone who you are.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,800
{\an5}I've put all of our lives in danger.

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,920
{\an5}So how many more people
are gonna get hurt because of me?

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,280
No! No!

48
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,920
That wasn't you.
That was the infection.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,240
You understand me?

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,080
Listen to me.

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,960
{\an5}You are Dr. Mary Hamilton.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,000
{\an5}You have saved so many lives, Mary.

53
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,040
{\an5}But what about Marquis?

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,160
{\an5}How are we gonna stop him?

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,520
{\an5}We're gonna get that Joy Buzzer fixed

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,000
and undo the damage
that Joker did to him.

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,000
{\an5}This thing spent 13 years
in cryo-freeze

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,960
{\an5}and then got chucked
into the Gotham River.

59
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,680
{\an5}Pretty sure we've voided
the warranty.

60
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,280
- So you can't fix it?
- No.

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,440
I mean my dad
would've studied this thing

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,840
after Batman took down the Joker.

63
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,640
{\an5}But maybe if we had my dad's AI,
we could get some answers.

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,520
Mary.

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,040
Any idea where it is?

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,760
{\an5}The night of the party,
I gave it to Marquis.

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,600
{\an5}I wanted to hurt you
in the worst possible way.

68
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,560
So sorry, Luke.

69
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,560
{\an5}It's okay. It's not your fault.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,480
I know who can fix
your little buzzer.

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,400
{\an5}The person who originally built it.

72
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,160
Meet Kiki Roulette,
the Joker's toymaker.

73
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,560
Her delightful creations
included the Joker's Acid Flower

74
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,200
{\an5}his infamous Smiley Face
Nerve Gas Bomb

75
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,560
{\an5}and that little trinket right there.

76
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,920
Sounds like you're a real fan.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,320
{\an5}There's nothing wrong
with admiring someone

78
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,720
{\an5}who takes pride in her work.

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,160
There is if her work killed people.

80
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,920
- Hundreds of people.
- Okay, so how do we find her?

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,920
Well, that's the problem.
When the Joker...

82
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,520
When the Joker was
apprehended by Batman

83
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,120
Kiki evaded capture and disappeared.

84
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,800
Can you access her medical records?

85
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,240
That's some pretty intense eyewear.

86
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,200
Probably
a very specific prescription.

87
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,880
Good call. Rare prescription indeed.

88
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,640
Factoring in deterioration of age...

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,480
Yeah, okay.

90
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Got a possible match in Drescher
for a Kathleen Rogers.

91
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,880
It could be an alias.
Yeah, I mean, this might be our girl.

92
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,160
The address is for a halfway house.

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,440
- Okay, I'm on it.
- No.

94
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,560
I'll go.

95
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
You should focus on Marquis.

96
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,200
{\an5}We're talking
about enlisting the help

97
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,160
{\an5}of an emotionally unstable terrorist

98
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,080
to repair frontal lobe damage
with a children's toy.

99
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,680
{\an5}A doctor should probably be involved.

100
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,280
Alice, go with her.

101
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,600
Oh, why me?

102
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,840
Yeah, why her?

103
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,000
Because as far as Marquis knows

104
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,480
{\an5}Alice and Mary are still Bat-enemies

105
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,320
{\an5}which means
he won't be targeting them.

106
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
You two, on the other hand,
are still in his crosshairs.

107
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,840
{\an5}I'm sorry, can we just
go back to the part

108
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,560
{\an5}about not being a Bat-enemy?
I'm confused.

109
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,120
Okay, so, what are we supposed to do?

110
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,360
{\an5}Lay low while I try to
track down Marquis.

111
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
Hey!

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,880
I got a better idea.

113
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,080
Why don't we just tell Marquis

114
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,480
I kissed you
and you pushed me away?

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,720
- Then I'll be in the clear, right?
- I didn't push you away.

116
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,520
Then what is it you think you did?

117
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I don't know, I...

118
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,800
- We have bigger problems.
- Is that what we are?

119
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
- A problem?
- You know what I mean.

120
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,840
Actually, that's the whole point.

121
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,640
I don't know and you won't tell me.

122
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,880
I feel like...

123
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,760
We need to focus
on keeping Gotham safe.

124
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,200
We can wait for us.

125
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,680
Sorry, am I interrupting?

126
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,840
- No.
- Yes.

127
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,160
I was just about to suit up
to find Marquis.

128
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,920
Well, you're not gonna have to
look very far.

129
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,280
He's on every channel.

130
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
The buildings you see behind me

131
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,000
are where all the insanity in Gotham

132
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,560
is supposed to be locked up safely
and away from the public.

133
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,280
But I'm here to tell you
the real insanity is out there.

134
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,200
And it's dressed up like a bat.

135
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,080
<i>What does that say about our city</i>

136
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,760
<i>that its supposed protector</i>

137
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,120
is signified by a rabid bloodsucker

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,280
who moves in the shadows,
hidden from the eyes of the public?

139
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,800
And any accountability?

140
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,080
How many people have to keep paying
the price for Batwoman's insanity?

141
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,680
<i>Shouldn't the city
at least know her name?</i>

142
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,280
But if Batwoman
won't take responsibility

143
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,520
I guess I'll have to.

144
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,800
<i>Somebody has to restore
the sanity to Gotham.</i>

145
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,120
That's why as CEO
of Wayne Enterprises

146
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,440
I've entered into a partnership
with the city

147
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,120
and I will pour millions of dollars
into improving this notorious asylum

148
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,120
so that the truly ill among us,
like Batwoman

149
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,560
can, at last, have the professional
help they so desperately need.

150
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,840
<i>Mr. Jet, what exactly are your plans</i>

151
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,800
<i>for improving mental health
in Gotham...?</i>

152
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,240
Gotta be honest, that's not the way

153
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,720
I thought Marquis
would be led into Arkham.

154
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,320
And I thought
him taking over Wayne was bad.

155
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,280
Whatever he's got planned for Arkham
can't be good.

156
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,600
I don't get it.

157
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,880
He had all of Gotham watching
and he could've outed me as Batwoman.

158
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,120
It would've been so easy
to destroy me.

159
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,560
Maybe you're not his target.

160
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,000
Maybe the thing he wants to destroy
is the symbol of the Bat itself.

161
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,880
I don't know.

162
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,400
I can't help but to think
there's another reason.

163
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,920
Well, whatever it is,
it's got Marquis presenting himself

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,480
to Gotham as some kind of hero.

165
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,000
Then we need to expose him
for what he really is.

166
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,280
Because apparently the purple hair
and Joker couture was too subtle?

167
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,000
He killed a Wayne security guard,
doctors at Jeturian.

168
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
I mean, there's gotta be video.

169
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,560
- He's scrubbed all that.
- There must be some proof.

170
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,960
Somewhere.

171
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Yeah.

172
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,880
And I think Jada's sitting on it.

173
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,160
She told me she had something
over Marquis

174
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
some kind of leverage
that kept her safe.

175
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,280
If it's bad enough to protect Jada...

176
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,000
maybe it's good enough
to protect the city.

177
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,040
Mr. Jet, I appreciate your generous
donation to Arkham

178
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,680
but I do have some concerns
about your plans

179
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,440
for a work-release program.

180
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,000
I see it as more of a
"compassionate non-confinement."

181
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,560
Mr. Jet,
these are dangerous criminals.

182
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,000
And you think locking them up
makes them any less dangerous?

183
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,440
How else do you expect a caged animal
to behave?

184
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,920
We're not talking
about stray dogs here.

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,360
And yet, that's exactly
how you're treating them.

186
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,480
These are sadistic rapists, Mr. Jet.

187
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,840
Serial murderers,
the worst of the worst.

188
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,360
Good.

189
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,960
That's exactly who I want to meet.

190
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,800
Victor Zsasz.

191
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,120
Like the hair.

192
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,400
I've been thinking
of growing mine out.

193
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,920
Marquis Jet.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,680
Big fan of your work.

195
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,640
Oh, then we have something in common.

196
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,400
I'm a fan of my work as well.

197
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
So it's true.

198
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,520
You mark each of your kills
with a scar.

199
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,280
Consider my body my resume.

200
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,080
Well, from the look of it

201
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,480
you're probably already collecting
your pension, huh?

202
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,320
There's always room for a few more.

203
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,240
I was hoping you'd say that.

204
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,000
Looks like the place.

205
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,920
Does it ever get easier?

206
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,440
Living with the things you've done?

207
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,680
And don't say it's all my fault.

208
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,640
Oh, that's what the Bat-Team's
been telling you?

209
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Yeah.

210
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,520
It's probably because I think
you're too emotionally fragile

211
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
to handle the truth.

212
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,080
Which is?

213
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,560
It's totally your fault.

214
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,280
That hunter didn't vine-hurl himself
into the tree.

215
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,800
And dying your hair back
to its natural color

216
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,920
doesn't change that.

217
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,840
So... So, what do I do now?

218
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
Easy.

219
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,320
You take all of your feelings
and you bury them deep down inside

220
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,080
and you cover them up with a layer
of "people die all the time"

221
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,200
then you sprinkle on some
"he probably did some bad stuff too."

222
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,560
And then you pack it down
with a nice, little bit of

223
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,160
"he might've even deserved it"

224
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,480
and then, poof, all those icky,
no-good feelings go bye-bye.

225
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,320
At least that's what I do.

226
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
But...

227
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm not a sociopath.

228
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,840
Amber, I'm not the one restricting
your curfew, you are.

229
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,800
Privilege comes
with its responsibilities.

230
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,600
Now go, go see if you can help out
in the kitchen.

231
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,400
- Hi.
- Hello.

232
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,400
We're looking for one
of your residents. Kiki Roulette?

233
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,360
Might be going by Kathleen Rogers?

234
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,880
Yeah, Kiki.

235
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,320
She left our care some time ago,
wasn't a good fit.

236
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Well, do you know where she went?

237
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,840
Honestly, we were just happy
to see her go.

238
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,000
Not that we don't wish her the best.

239
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
Oh, okay.

240
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,680
Well, thanks anyway.

241
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,080
Sorry to bother you.

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,320
Actually, we do mean to bother you.

243
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,240
Crazy knows crazy...

244
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Kiki.

245
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
It's Kathleen now.

246
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,280
What are you doing?

247
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,320
Marquis has my dad's AI.

248
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,080
If he's busy playing mayor
of crazy-town

249
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,400
now's my best chance to get it.

250
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,880
If you're breaking into Wayne Tower,
I'm going with you.

251
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,840
Nope. Sorry. You're staying put.

252
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,800
I'm not gonna be responsible
for putting

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,800
whatever you are to Ryan to danger.

254
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,640
- We kissed. It's not important.
- You sure about that?

255
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Fine.

256
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
I kissed her.

257
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,760
I thought she was into it
but then she blows me off.

258
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,720
Then she tries to order me to stand
down like I'm some Point Rock plebe

259
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,040
but I'm the only one on the Bat-Team

260
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,600
with an actual certification
in Special Weapons and Tactics.

261
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,120
Then you should be able to handle
the Line Launcher.

262
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,680
Saw Marquis on the TV.

263
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,480
It seems like he hates Batwoman
almost as much as you do.

264
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,240
That woman
shouldn't have provoked him.

265
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
First she abducts him
and then she loses him.

266
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,240
No wonder it sent him over the edge.

267
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,200
I don't think he needed much
of a push.

268
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,080
Yet you don't seem concerned
about being a target.

269
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,320
We have an arrangement.

270
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,600
Does this "arrangement"
have anything to do

271
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,960
with your videos
of Marquis' misdeeds?

272
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,640
His father died in a pretty
mysterious circumstances.

273
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,840
I bet you've got something
in that library

274
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,760
that could solve
that little whodunit.

275
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,000
And what if I did?

276
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,640
Then you need to use it. Now.

277
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,640
Turn it over to the authorities.

278
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
Stop protecting him.

279
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,160
Everything you have been afraid of
all these years

280
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,320
is about to happen.

281
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,440
If you think Marquis

282
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,960
is gonna let your home videos
get in the way of his revenge

283
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,120
you don't know your son.

284
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,320
Excuse me, Miss Jet?

285
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,200
There's a man here to see you.

286
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,400
He doesn't have an appointment.

287
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,040
Oh, my God!

288
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,880
But he does have a gun.

289
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,800
I promise, Miss Jet,
I won't take up much of your time

290
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,480
frankly because
you don't have much of it left.

291
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,360
Oh, hey, Ryan!

292
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,720
I'm actually glad that we ran
into each other, Ryan

293
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,520
because I gotta say, you have done
really well for yourself.

294
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,840
Much appreciated.

295
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,560
I meant to get you a congrats gift
after you made Wayne CEO

296
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,240
but by the time I got around to it,
you'd already been disgraced

297
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,960
and it just felt I could be
bringing up a sore subject.

298
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,200
But honestly, congrats, and sorry.

299
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,880
- You know this man?
- In another life.

300
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,200
"Life"! Thank you.

301
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Man, I was really struggling
for a segue there

302
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,840
and you totally bailed me out.

303
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,040
Life, as in yours, Miss Jet,
is hanging in the balance here.

304
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,200
You got the evidence you came for.

305
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,520
I'm afraid it's a little more
complicated than that.

306
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
Then why don't I make it simple?

307
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,400
Whatever you're being paid,
I'll triple it.

308
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,080
Well...

309
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,640
considering your son hired me

310
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,000
killing you just lets him
inherit more money

311
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,640
that he can then give to me

312
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,320
so it's really just a waste
of our time, yours especially.

313
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,520
Well, if it's me you're after...

314
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,960
then you can let my daughter go.

315
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
"Daughter"?

316
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,840
Wait, I thought your mom was dead.
Right?

317
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,600
Dead Mom Number 1 died in childbirth
blah, blah, blah, foster care

318
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,040
and then you were adopted
by Dead Mom Number 2.

319
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,840
So how does that make her
soon-to-be Dead Mom Number 3?

320
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,680
She's not.

321
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,760
She's my biological mother
who didn't die in childbirth.

322
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,080
So after years of separation

323
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,520
you two actually found each other
and reconnected

324
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,880
only to discover that,
despite being apart,

325
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,360
you both stormed
the corporate CEO patriarchy

326
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,920
to become powerful titans
of business?

327
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,880
Now that's what I call
a happy ending.

328
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,840
Except for the part where I have
to do what childbirth didn't.

329
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,360
But, uh-oh, twist!

330
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,360
There is a chance for
a last-minute rescue.

331
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,920
But only if Batwoman comes
to save you.

332
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
So here's the deal.

333
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,440
I left s little note
on the Bat-signal.

334
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
There it is.

335
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,760
Apparently, your son wants
to give Batwoman

336
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,400
a ringside seat to your demise.

337
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,480
I'm not really sure what her dog is
in this fight,

338
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,760
but let's put an hour on the clock
anyway.

339
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,320
Factoring in Gotham rush hour,

340
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
that ought to give Lady-Bat
plenty of time to get here.

341
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,560
Of course, then she has to stop me.

342
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,880
The suspense might kill me
before I have to kill you.

343
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,200
So...

344
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,880
If you two have any last
mother-daughter things

345
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,520
you wanna discuss,

346
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,760
funeral arrangements perhaps,

347
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,400
now would be the time.

348
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,120
Why would you want me
to fix this thing?

349
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,960
It's already hurt so many people.

350
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,520
Because we think we can use it
to help the last person it hurt.

351
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,360
The little boy on the bus.

352
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,040
Well that little caterpillar
blossomed

353
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,720
into quite the psychotic butterfly.

354
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,360
Exactly as the buzzer was designed
to do.

355
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,920
The electrical impulses rendered
the part of his brain

356
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,480
controlling empathy dormant.

357
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,200
Flipped it off like a light switch.

358
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,640
But another zap would flip it
back on?

359
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,360
In theory, yes.

360
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,960
A jolt to a psychotic brain
would reopen those neural pathways.

361
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,080
Okay, great.

362
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,480
I need my tools to fix it.

363
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,680
They're all back at the Joker's
old workshop.

364
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,840
I've worked so hard to put
all of this behind me.

365
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,720
I don't wanna go back.

366
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,960
Oh, come on.

367
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,440
The only thing you don't wanna
go back to is prison.

368
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,520
And as someone who used to be
a huge fan of yours,

369
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,800
I see right through that 12-step,
safe space, Den Mother routine.

370
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,440
So you can drop the act.

371
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,680
It's not an act.

372
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,240
I've worked for over a decade
and a half

373
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,840
to find ways to make up
for the damage I've done.

374
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,560
Who knew fixing this awful thing
would be one of them?

375
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,440
You should save your time
and just shoot me.

376
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,120
- Batwoman's not coming.
- You think?

377
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,160
I don't know if you've been
keeping up with current events,

378
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,920
but there's a bit of bad blood
between me and her.

379
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,480
You too? Wow.

380
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,080
We have so much in common.

381
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,880
I mean, I didn't abandon a daughter
to the city's

382
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,040
brutally underfunded foster system,

383
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,520
all the while perched comfortably
atop a billion-dollar empire,

384
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
but, you know, potato-potato.

385
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,280
I didn't abandon her.

386
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,760
No. You just paid the doctor
$2 million to do it for you.

387
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,000
Now this is the content I came for.

388
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,160
The money wasn't to cover up
giving birth to you, Ryan.

389
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,080
No. It was to cover up your affair.

390
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,440
It's more complicated than that.

391
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,440
It was a different time
and I was in a different place.

392
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,760
I was looking at everything

393
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
that I worked for
going down the drain.

394
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,880
And then the doctor told me
about a couple

395
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,720
who were desperate to have a child
of their own and...

396
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,720
I saw it as an opportunity
to give you a loving home.

397
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,840
The 2 million was supposed to go
to the family

398
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,040
to ensure that you would want
for nothing.

399
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,160
All those years,
I thought you were being cared for

400
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,880
by loving parents but...

401
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,040
It was only when you found me
that I realized

402
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,440
that the doctor kept the money
for himself

403
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,800
and dropped you off at
a fire station.

404
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,520
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

405
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,440
Because I was trying
to push you away.

406
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,320
To protect you from Marquis.

407
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,760
But...

408
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,040
Clearly I failed on all fronts.

409
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,320
I just wanna thank you both

410
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,080
for letting me be a part
of this special moment, truly.

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,120
Thank you.

412
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,480
But...

413
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,680
It seems Batwoman is a no-show.

414
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,800
And I'm afraid deadline
is a deadline.

415
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,920
It's a very violent word
when you think about it.

416
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,080
But entirely appropriate
to this moment.

417
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,040
Ryan, any last words for Ms. Jet?

418
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,320
Yeah.

419
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,200
Mom...

420
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Duck.

421
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,920
My God.

422
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,200
That's why Batwoman didn't show up.

423
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,840
She was here the whole time.

424
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,120
Anything I can do to help?

425
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,480
Yes. Keep her from touching that.

426
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,920
I remember you, Talky Teddy.

427
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,160
You were the hottest toy
of the holidays.

428
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Every kid in class wanted one.

429
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,680
Little did they know, Kiki over here
had attached the pull cord

430
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,000
to the pin of a fragmentation grenade
hidden inside.

431
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,280
- How many people were...
- Killed?

432
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,120
Five.

433
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,520
Two adults, three children

434
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,080
and another 12 suffered
permanent injuries.

435
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,080
How do you move on from that?

436
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,520
You don't.

437
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,360
You live with it every day.

438
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,680
At least that's what my therapist
spent years

439
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,280
trying to get through to me.

440
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,400
I had all the excuses.

441
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,520
"It wasn't me."
"The Joker made me do it."

442
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,160
There's no escape from all the pain
that I caused.

443
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,800
My mind started to play tricks on me.

444
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,480
I would see my victims everywhere.

445
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,600
What did you do to make it stop?

446
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,000
Once I reach my breaking point,

447
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,840
my therapist insisted
that I had to do the hard work,

448
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,960
that I needed to accept
responsibility

449
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,920
for everything that I'd done.

450
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,080
The people I hurt
can't forget what I did to them.

451
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,760
So how can I?

452
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,120
Nice landing.
Ryan would be impressed.

453
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,760
Not that she'd ever show it.

454
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,120
She's just so hard to read sometimes.

455
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,400
You know one minute
I think she's into me,

456
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,160
the next minute,
she's shutting me out.

457
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,400
And you thought pulling her in
for a kiss would clear things up?

458
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,160
Cameras deactivated.

459
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,520
Honestly, I don't know
what I was thinking.

460
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,160
I do.
Pretty sure I know your type.

461
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,400
Hey, for the record,

462
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,880
I was into Ryan long before
I knew she was Batwoman.

463
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,320
Exactly how long for the record?

464
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,520
Not important.

465
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
You had a crush on Ryan back
when you thought she was a criminal?

466
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,600
We are done talking about this,

467
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,960
I'm not.

468
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,480
Pretty sure you are.

469
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,120
Dad? Can you hear me?

470
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
<i>Been a while, son.</i>

471
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,440
Yeah, Believe me,
I know. I'm taking you home.

472
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,760
Hold up.

473
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,560
We've got access to Marquis' laptop.

474
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,680
We'd be crazy if we didn't
take a peek under the hood.

475
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,800
Dad? Wanna help us hack a laptop?

476
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,840
I know a guy in my profession's

477
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,480
not supposed to develop feelings
for his targets,

478
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,760
but you two really bulls-eyed me
right here.

479
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,000
So where do we go from here?

480
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,960
Well, based on recent history,

481
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
you call up Dana Dewitt
with your latest scoop

482
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,440
outing me as Batwoman.

483
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,320
I wouldn't do that to you.

484
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,160
Are you sure about that?

485
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,280
Ever since we've met,

486
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,440
all you've done is take away
anything good in my like.

487
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,280
You came after me as CEO of Wayne,

488
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,760
and you came after me as Batwoman.

489
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,320
And you think some sob story

490
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,320
about how you tried to
give me $2 million

491
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,000
make a damn difference?

492
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,520
Didn't you ever wonder where I was?

493
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,440
How I was doing?

494
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,720
Did you ever even think about me?

495
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,840
Of course I thought about you.

496
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,360
Yeah.

497
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,920
Just not enough to check up on me.

498
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,960
You wanna know what I would've
wanted instead of $2 million?

499
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,400
A mom that cared enough
to make sure I was in good hands.

500
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,200
That I had someone to walk me
to school

501
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,960
on my first day of kindergarten.

502
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,720
Someone to make me cupcakes
for my birthday.

503
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,560
Someone to yell at me
for staying up too late watching TV.

504
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,080
But I had to wait 14 years
for any of that.

505
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,600
You're right.

506
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
And look at you.

507
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,400
The child I gave nothing to,
and you achieved all of this.

508
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,240
I gave Marquis everything,

509
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,360
and look how he turned out.

510
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,720
Maybe the greatest thing
I ever did for you

511
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,120
was staying out of your life.

512
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,080
Ryan? Marquis is using Arkham inmates
as his own personal security force.

513
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,960
And he's siccing Zsasz on you
and Jada.

514
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,240
Yeah. Already dealt with him.
But how do you know about that?

515
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,080
Luke and I hacked into his computer.
After we broke into Wayne Tower.

516
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,040
- You what? I told you to lay low.
- And I didn't listen.

517
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,160
Because I don't have to.

518
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,680
You're not my keeper.
And you're not my anything.

519
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,360
No, just someone
trying to keep you safe.

520
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
Fight about it later.
We got bigger problems.

521
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,400
According to his call log

522
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,840
Marquis has been in contact
with Kiki Roulette.

523
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,640
-You got it working again?
-Yes.

524
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,560
But the circuit board's so corroded,
buzzer's only got one zap left in it.

525
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,040
And that's the good news.

526
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,960
Which would seem to imply
there's bad news.

527
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,400
Oh, it's bad. It's really bad.

528
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,000
Because you see,
now that this thing's working,

529
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,760
I'm not sure how much longer
Marquis needs you alive anymore.

530
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,160
Right back at you.

531
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,200
I probably should've expected that.

532
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,240
And that.

533
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,040
Mary's not picking up.

534
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,080
Sophie's sending you
the GPS location of her phone.

535
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,560
-Batwing out.
-Let's get the hell out of there.

536
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,120
One second.
I want to clone the hard drive.

537
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,320
If I knew you were gonna be snooping,
I'd have cleared my browser history.

538
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,400
So everything you said
your therapist told you

539
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,000
about healing,
doing all the hard work,

540
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,120
those were all lies?

541
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Oh, no, no, no. That was all true.
I just didn't want to do it.

542
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,360
But in my defense, though,
my therapist was Harleen Quinzel

543
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,280
so you know...

544
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,640
Kiks,
how's my favorite toymaker doing?

545
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,880
Happy to be dealt back into the game.

546
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,840
Well, you can thank your former
Arkham cellmate for connecting us,

547
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,400
and I can thank you
for getting me the Joy Buzzer.

548
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,400
Yeah, about that,
there's not much joy left.

549
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,320
Circuitry's shot. You got one buzz.

550
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,480
Good. That's all I need.

551
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,520
Boss, you better take this.

552
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,600
Your plan to make me witness
Jada's death didn't work out.

553
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,680
Well, if somebody needed a win,
it was you.

554
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,400
You know honestly, with all
that bad press you're getting,

555
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,800
I'm shocked that you even wanted
to show your face in public.

556
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,240
<i>How about I give them a name
to go with it?</i>

557
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,480
-What do you think they'll say then?
-Not a damn thing.

558
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
Because
you're not going to tell them.

559
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,960
Oh, you sure about that?

560
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,240
<i>Yeah, you are too.</i>

561
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,640
Because the moment you say my name,

562
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,720
all of Gotham will know
how much I accomplished with nothing.

563
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,040
and how little you accomplished
with everything.

564
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,200
<i>Well, you got me there.</i>

565
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,960
But you know what I've got?
Your friends.

566
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,520
Not to mention your sidekick
and your side-piece.

567
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,560
What do you want?

568
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,320
To do what I promised.

569
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,360
To hurt the people you care about
one by one.

570
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,080
<i>How do you wanna do this? You...</i>

571
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,680
You want to do it Alphabetically?
By birthday? By height?

572
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,960
Hey, Batwoman,

573
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,800
remember when I told you
I could take care of myself?

574
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,120
I meant it.

575
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,720
That's quite an entrance.

576
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,560
Don't get all impressed just yet.

577
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,200
I lost the buzzer.
Marquis has it now.

578
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,280
I just wanted you to know
so you can be ready.

579
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,240
There's no telling
what he has planned.

580
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,440
I'm sorry I wasn't able to stop him.

581
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,440
I'm pretty sure I'm the one
who should be saying that.

582
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,440
I failed him.

583
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,520
Just like I failed you.

584
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,280
I couldn't acknowledge
the love that I had for you.

585
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,320
So I signed a check,
and I hoped for the best.

586
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,080
But it doesn't mean
that I didn't love you.

587
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,040
Or that I didn't consider you
a part of me.

588
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,440
I named you after my own father.

589
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,720
And I did think about you. Every day.

590
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,480
But I had to bury those feelings
because they would have crushed me.

591
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,720
Which is clearly what I do
when I don't want to get hurt.

592
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,080
I put up a wall.

593
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,600
So that's where I get it from.

594
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,640
That's my life, Ryan.

595
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,160
Don't let it be yours.

596
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,120
Right.

597
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,600
Diagnostic complete.

598
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,800
Looks like you survived
a nightmare road trip

599
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,320
and a stint with a Joker fanboy.

600
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,640
<i>Thanks to you, son.</i>

601
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,280
<i>I see you decided
to wear the suit again.</i>

602
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,400
Yeah. Sorry about that.

603
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,720
<i>- Don't be.</i>
- Well, good. Because I'm not.

604
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,480
It took me a while,
but I finally realized that

605
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,400
I was just using the suit
to protect myself

606
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,000
from the things
I didn't want to face.

607
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,080
<i>So you figured it out, you
didn't need the suit to be a hero.</i>

608
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,720
<i>I knew you'd get there, Lucas.</i>

609
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Thanks, Dad.

610
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,560
But you couldn't have told me
that sooner.

611
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,200
Any other thoughts
you'd like to share?

612
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,560
<i>Just one. I'm proud of you.</i>

613
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,120
They say you should never meet
your heroes.

614
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,520
What do they say
about meeting your villains?

615
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,320
I'm sure
they'll say we make a great team.

616
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,600
And with one buzz left.

617
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,760
Who's gonna get the last laugh?

618
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Alice?

619
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,200
It's me.

620
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,840
You can come out now. I'm alone.

621
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,800
What's with all the black?

622
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,440
Where did you come from?

623
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,880
It's actually for where I'm going.

624
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,440
The wake. For the hunter.

625
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,560
The man that I killed.

626
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,960
Oh, my goodness

627
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,400
that touchy-feely terrorist really
did a number on you, didn't she?

628
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,600
Please tell me you're not taking
life advice from a woman

629
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,560
who puts hand grenades
in teddy bear tummies.

630
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,560
It doesn't mean that she is wrong.

631
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,040
No, it means she cocooned explosives
inside a fuzzy symbol of kindness

632
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,200
that children
instinctively want to hug.

633
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,440
And if I don't take responsibility

634
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,000
for all of the pain
that I have caused

635
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,000
and do the hard work to make amends,
then I am no different than her.

636
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Kiki really sent you on a guilt trip,
huh?

637
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,720
And look, she even packed you a bag.

638
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,120
Actually, this is for you.

639
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,560
With your immunity deal
gone bye-bye

640
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,080
I packed this much
of your stuff as I could fit.

641
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,440
There's cash in there too.
Enough to get you far away from here.

642
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Yeah...

643
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,080
I can't leave Gotham just yet.

644
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,320
What possible reason
do you have to stay?

645
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,520
Everyone is hunting you, Alice.

646
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,800
I know. But...

647
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,960
what if I wasn't Alice?

648
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,440
I don't want to be her anymore.

649
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,600
I don't want to be a sociopath.

650
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,000
Oh, my gosh.

651
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,600
This is huge.

652
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,320
I can help you.

653
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,440
I was hoping you'd say that.

654
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,440
Because I'm not really the kind of
gal who likes to do the hard work.

655
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,160
Then what do you want?

656
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,360
That Joy Buzzer.

657
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,280
We need the buzzer for Marquis.

658
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,160
But you have a sister
who needs it more.

659
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,600
Look, if you brought me down here
to lecture me

660
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,800
I don't tell you when to be Batwoman

661
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,000
and you can't tell me
what I can and can't do.

662
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,000
- I'm not your sidekick.
- It's not about that.

663
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,000
Well, then if it's about you
wanting to protect me.

664
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,720
I am not your damsel to rescue.

665
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,480
I know.

666
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,720
It's not about that, either.

667
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,320
Then what is it about?

668
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,280
It's about me being real with you.

669
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,080
I keep people at arm's length.

670
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,400
I've lost a lot of people in my life

671
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,960
and I'm scared to death
to lose anyone else.

672
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,520
So I don't let people in

673
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,800
and the whole superhero thing

674
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,880
gives me the excuse
to keep doing that.

675
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
I get it.

676
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,640
I won't push.

677
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,080
You don't have to.

678
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
I'll buy you a new one.

679
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,920
I hate that thing.

680
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,600
Yup.
