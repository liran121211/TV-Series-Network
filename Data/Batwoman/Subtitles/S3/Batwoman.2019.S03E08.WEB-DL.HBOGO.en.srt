1
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,200
She's not here.

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,280
Stay sharp, Montoya.

3
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,400
Pamela Isley! Show yourself!

4
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,960
Surrender or we will use force.

5
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,480
I'm right here.

6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,080
Stop.

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,360
Please.

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,000
Please don't make me do this.

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,360
Take the shot, Montoya.

10
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,280
No!

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,520
No, no, no!

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
No!

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,520
Why are you doing this?

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,600
Because someone has to care.

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,200
Very few people can pull off green
with any swagger

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,560
{\an5}but I actually don't hate this for you.

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,120
Yeah. It's interesting. I...

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,360
{\an5}I'm sorry, I've never been
in a position before

19
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
where I couldn't be honest

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,360
because I was worried about hurting
someone's feelings so I'm stalling.

21
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
{\an5}I think that's the sweetest thing

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,400
you've ever said to me.

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
- Did you order more food?
- No.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,320
Did you order more strippers?

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,080
Ms. Hamilton, it's time to ask you

26
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,520
{\an5}to pack your things

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,400
{\an5}and part ways with us.

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,840
Rude.

29
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,600
You've racked up an $8,000 bill

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,080
without showing any ability
to pay for it.

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,320
{\an5}I told the lady at the desk

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,080
{\an5}ten times to try all my other cards.

33
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,120
{\an5}They've all been declined,
Ms. Hamilton.

34
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,920
Oh, actually it's Dr Hamilton,
it's not a Miss.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,520
{\an5}I'm afraid I need to ask you
to leave

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,720
{\an5}or the Metropolis PD
will be escorting you out.

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
This is all a misunderstanding.

38
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,720
Give me some time to figure it out?

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,520
{\an5}Please, take all the time you need.

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,600
We'll accept your apology

41
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,480
and a complimentary bottle of Dom
for the inconvenience.

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,280
You're very kind, ma'am.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
I know.

44
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,200
{\an5}Did the bat bitches cut me off?

45
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,560
All your fancy degrees,
and you didn't see that coming?

46
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,240
{\an5}I thought we were past this.

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,880
{\an5}I mean, one would think
that nearly vine-squeezing

48
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,520
the life out of your bestie

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,480
and then crushing the only cure
for you in existence

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,680
was a pretty good indicator
that it was time to move on

51
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,120
from the friendship.

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
Anyone else find it ironic

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,360
that when I beg Ryan and Luke
for their attention

54
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,920
they're too busy with their own drama

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,120
but then when I finally step away
for some much-needed me-time

56
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,960
{\an5}Mary Hamilton's the coveted
Bat Mission of the week?

57
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,360
{\an5}If this is a lecture on
being Batwoman's most wanted

58
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,240
{\an5}trust me, I already took the exam.

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,160
Well, what do I do?

60
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,080
You kill them immediately.

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Alice.

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
Fine.

63
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,600
{\an5}As someone who had
a so-called family member

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,440
{\an5}obsessed with the idea
that I could change

65
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,800
here's what you do.

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,440
{\an5}You make your friends
hate you so much

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,160
that they want to give up on you.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,920
Flowers aren't a fix-all, Pam.
My partner lost a kidney.

69
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,360
But they're white tulips.

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,160
Technically
from the Liliaceae family.

71
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,400
They symbolize forgiveness.

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,960
Would you rather it be a kidney?

73
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,680
- I'm trying here, Renee.
- He could've died.

74
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,560
He was going to shoot me.

75
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,200
Because I couldn't.
I'm supposed to have his back.

76
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,640
No, you're supposed to have my back.

77
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,360
Don't you see how unfair that is?

78
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,040
I took an oath to uphold the law

79
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,640
and you're out there breaking it
constantly for the sake of what?

80
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Mother nature?

81
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,560
I know global warming,
water shortage, extinction of species

82
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,720
is an inconvenient thought for you

83
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,800
but, unfortunately, this reusable
coffee mug isn't the solution.

84
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,920
What is the solution then?
Quitting your job?

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,240
Ostracizing our friends?

86
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,000
Becoming so obsessed to the point
where I don't even recognize you?

87
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,240
Are you coming with me or not?

88
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,120
Not if you go
where I can't follow you.

89
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,880
Stay here.

90
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,200
Stay the quirky, brilliant scientist

91
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,720
who loves reading and baseball
that I fell in love with

92
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,720
- a decade ago.
- She's gone.

93
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,040
She's blossomed into someone
who can stand up for herself.

94
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,520
And more importantly,
for those things that can't.

95
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,760
I froze Mary's bank accounts.
I think.

96
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,400
Internet cut out ten times.

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,160
And now I have
the spinning wheel of death.

98
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
That's awesome.

99
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,600
Does asbestos have a smell?

100
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,440
Anyone smell that?

101
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,640
Dead rat in the wall.

102
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
Give it three days, it'll pass.

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,920
We don't have three days.
You saw her clinic.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,480
Yeah, it's completely overrun
by plant life.

105
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,960
You don't find that symbolic?

106
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,400
- We won't let her forget who she is.
- I hope.

107
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,560
That's sweet.
How's that working out for you?

108
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm sorry, I left my sarcasm meter
in the Batcave

109
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,320
I no longer have access to.

110
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,440
Is there something you would like
to say to me?

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,880
- Take off the kid gloves, Ryan.
- Kid gloves?

112
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,640
You wouldn't have Marquis arrested
because he's family.

113
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,760
You underestimated Mary
because she's your friend.

114
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,680
And now you're locked out
of your Batcave

115
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,680
and your bestie's on the lam
with a serial killer.

116
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,520
You jump in if I'm missing anything.

117
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,480
Okay. What the hell
was I supposed to do?

118
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,160
Pummel Mary with batarangs?

119
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,400
Let them throw Marquis in Arkham

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,080
for a brain injury
that isn't his fault?

121
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,680
It's called making hard choices.

122
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
Why are we even here?

123
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,360
There wasn't a toxic sewer
with Wi-Fi access?

124
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,360
Renee's not wrong, Ryan.

125
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,720
We need a harder stance.

126
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,080
By agreeing with the woman
who's blackmailing me

127
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
because you're sleeping with her?

128
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,240
Wow, I think I smell the asbestos.

129
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Maybe we should go get some air.

130
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,000
Look, I get it. Mary's your friend.

131
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,760
I thought I could plead and hope
and rationalize with Pam, too.

132
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,880
It didn't work.

133
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,240
Eventually, it got to the point
where she made me choose.

134
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,320
My obligation to the city or her.

135
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,480
So, what did you do?

136
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Something Pam
would never forgive me for.

137
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,800
I sold my soul to Batman.

138
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,360
He knew he couldn't trust Arkham
to contain her

139
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,040
so he developed a desiccation serum
that mimicked the process

140
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,280
a plant goes through
when it's denied water and sunlight.

141
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,800
The device used to inject it
is coded to the serum

142
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,440
meaning it's also the only way
to extract it from her.

143
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,120
So if we got more of the serum,
we can use it on Mary.

144
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,120
I have the device but he only made
one dose of serum.

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,560
It's currently pumping
through Pamela's bloodstream.

146
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,880
So, where is she?

147
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,120
- No one knows.
- Okay.

148
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
But if we find her, then presumably
we could siphon the serum

149
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
and use it to stop Mary, right?

150
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Wrong.

151
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,960
First of all, accidentally unleashing
an eco-terrorist

152
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,360
will not be a good look for us.

153
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,960
Second, do you know
what desiccation means?

154
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,840
We would be dehydrating Mary
to the brink of death.

155
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,880
No, the serum
was just to put Pam down.

156
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,040
And that was ten years ago.

157
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,560
If we remove it,
my guess is she stays dormant.

158
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,080
Unless she comes into contact
with sunlight or water.

159
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,920
As for point number two,
kid gloves, Ryan.

160
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,360
Did you hear what Renee just said?

161
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,040
Pam will never forgive her
for what she did to her.

162
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
We are not putting Mary
through that same torture

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,400
so she can hate us too.

164
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,080
This could be our only chance
to save Mary.

165
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,440
The true Mary would want us
to stop her

166
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,440
before she can do something
that she can't take back.

167
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,000
We cannot help her
unless we stop her.

168
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,760
Fine.

169
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,800
If I were Batman,
where would I stash Poison Ivy?

170
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,280
My best bet is that Bruce wrote about
Pamela Isley in his journals

171
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,600
which are in the Batcave here.

172
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,120
But Marquis' state-of-the-art
interior and exterior cameras

173
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,240
mean no root, balcony,
or garage access.

174
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,960
Can you hack into the feed
and buy me some time?

175
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,520
- Not with dial-up.
- Manpower?

176
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
Five security guards per floor.

177
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,000
- Digital upgrades?
- According to our former staff

178
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,480
every executive elevator
requires a thumb scan

179
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,160
and his office is locked
with a retinal scan.

180
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,200
Guys, we're not getting
into this building.

181
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,040
Why is Marquis calling me?

182
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Am I supposed to take this?

183
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,320
What the hell does he want?

184
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,200
Guess I'm about to find out.

185
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm sorry,
I was a detective for eight years.

186
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,920
I'm just learning now
that Bruce Wayne was Batman?

187
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,000
<i>What up, sis? Quick question for you.</i>

188
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,000
<i>Is this thing legit?</i>

189
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,920
<i>What do you think I can hawk it for?
Buck 50? Two?</i>

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,360
What are you doing, Marquis?

191
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,880
I'm redecorating my office.

192
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,600
You do know you had a chess set,
right?

193
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,000
<i>- You should be in jail.</i>
- Oh, samesies, sis.

194
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,880
Remember when you had me kidnapped?

195
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,120
<i>That's illegal.</i>

196
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,440
You wanna call it sixes and move on?

197
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,840
You need help. You need a doctor.
It's not too late.

198
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,320
- Hold that thought.
- Sir.

199
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,880
<i>The planner's upstairs
ready to take you</i>

200
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,280
to the station for the party tonight.

201
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,960
And your mask is here for a fitting.

202
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Two seconds.

203
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,680
Sorry about that.
You were calling me a mental case?

204
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,000
You wouldn't have called me
if a tiny part of you

205
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,160
wasn't reaching out for help.

206
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,160
<i>Just like there's a tiny part of you
that loves me, right?</i>

207
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,000
<i>Else, you would have had my ass
thrown in Arkham.</i>

208
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,800
And because you love me, you tried
to turn me into an ice cube.

209
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,800
<i>Anyway,
I just wanted to say thank you.</i>

210
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,280
<i>The cold, the near-death of it all.</i>

211
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,520
Gotta say, it awoke something in me
because I've never felt this alive.

212
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,040
Marquis Jet is coming for you,
Gotham!

213
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,200
<i>You'll be hearing from me soon.</i>

214
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,080
Wanna talk about it?

215
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,240
I think Marquis is throwing a party
at Wayne tonight.

216
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,760
And we're gonna crash it.

217
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,880
So we should run our identities. Go.

218
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,080
Hello, I'm Spencer Glad,
former Olympic athlete.

219
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,200
Rumored to be the next owner
of the Gotham Knights.

220
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,400
I'll hit you up for floor seats,
Spence.

221
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
The name's Cecilia Langley.

222
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,320
Heiress to a whiskey fortune
and world traveler.

223
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,400
Penelope Devereux, who for some
reason runs a board game empire?

224
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Honestly, dream job.

225
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,520
Just gonna say it,
my girl sounds hot.

226
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
Also, how are we not gonna run
into these people tonight?

227
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,640
Yeah, I sent some emails.
They think they're uninvited.

228
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,600
And yes, she is.

229
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,040
I fitted your mask with ocular
mesh scanners from the Batsuit.

230
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,160
Be careful. Sophie, yours is from
the Dollar Store. Go nuts.

231
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,400
Okay, so we get in,
get past security

232
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,720
get to the Batcave,
find Bruce's journals

233
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,840
and find Pam.

234
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Oh, and, Penelope, you're French.

235
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,240
Wait, what?

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,360
Eight of clubs? What's this about?

237
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,200
Hopefully, we'll be long gone
before it matters.

238
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,320
<i>Who wants to play a game?</i>

239
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,400
There's nothing worse in life
than a fake smile.

240
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,680
Couple days ago

241
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,680
I sat down at the table
of my brand new board room

242
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,560
surrounded by men and women
who were supposed to be my soldiers.

243
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,560
And they told me
that I wasn't the right man

244
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,960
- to lead Wayne Enterprises.
- Yeah, right.

245
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,240
- Oh, man. Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi. I'll take this for you.

246
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,000
But it was the way that they said it.

247
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,880
No crack or anything. That's crazy.

248
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,280
So condescending.
Like they were mad about it.

249
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Like this.

250
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,600
So I fired their asses!

251
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,200
Each of you has proven
to be of savage mind.

252
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,000
That's who I want
at my Wayne Enterprises.

253
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,920
Jack of Hearts.

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,480
Do we just crash a deranged group
job interview?

255
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,160
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

256
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,440
Hands on the table, Jack of Hearts.

257
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,360
True or false.

258
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,480
When we climb to the top, we got
to be willing to get a little crazy.

259
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,640
True.

260
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,680
How's this? Close enough?

261
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,400
No. We need a full retinal map
to fool the scanner.

262
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,520
You need to be a lot closer.

263
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,240
How am I supposed to do that
while he's playing game show host?

264
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,720
All I know is I switch the SIM card
on his assistant's tablet

265
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,880
and now I have full access
to tower security cams.

266
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,840
Okay. It's not a competition.

267
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Yeah, sure thing.

268
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,440
But Sophie just got
Marquis' thumbprint

269
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,760
so kind of just waiting on you here.

270
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,840
Complete this sentence.

271
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,480
The sick among us deserve our...

272
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,520
Pity?

273
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,680
The answer we were looking for
was fear.

274
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,640
Tough luck. Who's next?

275
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,960
Come on. Don't be shy.

276
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Look, I promise, this is
the opportunity of a lifetime.

277
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,480
Three of Diamonds.

278
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,760
<i>Oui, c'est moi.</i>

279
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,600
Miss Penelope Devereux, I presume?

280
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,280
Okay. Here we go.

281
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,280
<i>The only Parisian on my guest list.</i>

282
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,480
You created the game
Three Murders at the Bowery.

283
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,920
May I say, your work
is most thoughtfully deranged.

284
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,600
<i>Merci.</i>

285
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,000
Just... just a few more seconds.

286
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
True or false.

287
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,360
An artist always puts herself,
no matter how dark, into her work.

288
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,880
<i>Oui.</i>

289
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,400
Whenever we reveal our darkness
into the light

290
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,960
we are no longer scared.

291
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,160
<i>Non.</i>

292
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,400
Finish this sentence.

293
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,560
A mother's love is...

294
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,600
Scan complete. We're good to go.

295
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,000
Not my problem.

296
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,240
You know, if my therapist was here,
she'd say it's never a good idea

297
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,680
to hunt a desiccated body
while angry.

298
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,960
Just tell me why she wants to be here
all of a sudden.

299
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,160
It's not all of a sudden.

300
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,360
We're planning to spend
our entire lives together.

301
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,240
If Bruce mentioned anything about Pam

302
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,200
there's a good chance
I'll understand it.

303
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,400
Just because you wanna kiss
and make up with her

304
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
doesn't mean we're good.

305
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,000
I get why you're pissed.

306
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,400
But remember something.

307
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,800
Poison Ivy cost me
the love of my life.

308
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,160
I'm trying to help.

309
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,320
I'll take your help,
then I want my name.

310
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,160
Batwoman's name, out of your mouth.

311
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,280
We've pretty much cleaned up
everything on your list.

312
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,160
That's a fun way of saying
the Joker's Joy Buzzer

313
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,760
- is still unaccounted for.
- Okay, we need Alice to find it.

314
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,120
Wait. Alice was your job, right?

315
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,920
And you were hooking up with her
at her place

316
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,360
which I hope is nicer
than her office.

317
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,280
My place is rent-controlled.
Who cares if it's nice?

318
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,960
Really thought Wayne Tower
was tall enough

319
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,240
for us to get to handshakes, ladies.

320
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,560
All right. Hey. I thought I told you
to lock the door.

321
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,800
We're the cleaning ladies.

322
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,760
Sorry about the mess.

323
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,680
Can you face the other way?

324
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,560
We kind of got a hidden entry
situation going here.

325
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,320
Let's have some fun.

326
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,720
Guys, please tell me
you've figured out

327
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
where Poison Ivy's buried.

328
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,000
We just got to the journals.

329
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,120
<i>Be quick about it
because Mary just got here.</i>

330
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,480
Are you serious?

331
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
Mary came home?
Is she looking for us?

332
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,760
Just judging a book
by its cover here

333
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,080
but I think it's more likely that
she's looking for Freak Fertilizer.

334
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,120
Any sign of Alice with her?

335
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,400
Not yet, but I'll keep eyes out
on the security cams.

336
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,760
Don't let her leave this building.

337
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,320
Great, I mean, she's been
so cooperative lately

338
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
- I see no problems there.
- Okay, call if you need backup.

339
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,960
If Mary's here, it's for a reason.

340
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,080
And I can assure you
it's not to dance.

341
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,360
Let's just get through these.

342
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,760
Hey, I promise, I just want to talk.

343
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,040
Okay, or I'll just grab a number,
stay right here.

344
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,280
Mary Hamilton.

345
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,520
Well, well.

346
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
I should probably fire my publicist,
Mary Hamilton

347
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,400
because you should know
your friends no longer live here.

348
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,440
Well, I'm no PR rep

349
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,200
but if she's the one who came up
with your "deck of cards" theme

350
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,160
it's definitely something
you should consider.

351
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm not feeling the vibes
you're putting out.

352
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,280
And that's a shame because you...

353
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,400
you looked like
you'd be a lot of fun.

354
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,960
Don't give up on me so fast,
Mr. C.E. bro.

355
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,920
You haven't even heard the reason
I came all this way to find you.

356
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,760
Dance?

357
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,400
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

358
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
We don't have time for this.

359
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
New plan.

360
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,800
Bruce archived these chronologically,
so let's start there.

361
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,000
When was the first time you contacted
Batman for help?

362
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,800
It was early June 2011.

363
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,920
Okay.

364
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,160
Does any of this look familiar?

365
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,320
This.

366
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,360
This is the Gotham City Dam.

367
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,880
Bruce wouldn't have desiccated Pam
around that much water.

368
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,040
He didn't. He needed to stop her
from destroying it.

369
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,280
The Dam was her next target.

370
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,720
Okay, okay. I'm sorry,
why did you love this woman?

371
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,080
Because through it all
I knew it really wasn't her.

372
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,160
What's happening to Mary,
what happened to Pam...

373
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,560
it wasn't a fair fight.

374
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,920
I appreciate the symbolism

375
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,960
but technically
you just killed a tulip.

376
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,600
You going somewhere?

377
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,080
Yes, I am.

378
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,680
Question is, do I pack
one toothbrush or two?

379
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,920
Guys at the precinct
mentioned something

380
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,640
about a break-in
at Gotham Dam last night.

381
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,440
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

382
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,400
I haven't been studying my ass off
for my detective exam for nothing.

383
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,200
What are you planning to do there?

384
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,240
You want the truth
so you have to break up with me

385
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,600
or a lie so we can stay together?

386
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,800
Don't do that. Don't put this on me.

387
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
Why not?

388
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,840
You already know what I want.

389
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,760
I want to save Gotham
from becoming a toxic waste dump

390
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,120
and I'd like you
to support me while I do it.

391
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,040
So what do you want?

392
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,400
For you to choose one.

393
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Your cause, flooding this city

394
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,800
wiping full neighborhoods
off the map.

395
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,800
Or me.

396
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,320
Above all else, I want you.

397
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,880
But I need you to trust
that I know what I'm doing here.

398
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,520
What is this for?

399
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,560
Forgiveness.

400
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,960
You think of something?

401
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,200
You're good?

402
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,640
You got something.

403
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,040
Bruce wrote that Poison Ivy
would have to be kept

404
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,360
where no one would look for her.

405
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,640
But somewhere he could get to her

406
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,480
- if he needed.
- So close.

407
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,480
He wouldn't have buried her
anywhere near their usual hotspots.

408
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,280
Docks, shipyards, back alleys...

409
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,720
No, it'd have to be dark and dry.

410
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,720
No water. No light.
No other plant life.

411
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,160
Water was his biggest concern.

412
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,040
A single drop could be enough
to re-animate her.

413
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,440
Gotham City is a damn island
where it rains 300 days a year.

414
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,720
Are you sure
he didn't make a deal with GCPD?

415
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,600
For some kind of special protective
custody?

416
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,120
She's not at Blackgate, and I checked
the "off-books" wing at Arkham too.

417
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,320
There has to be an answer
we're not seeing.

418
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
Oh, my God.

419
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,480
What if she's here?

420
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,440
You spend your whole life

421
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,040
in the service of logic
and forensic evidence

422
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,760
and then you know what love does?

423
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,200
It makes you want to say things
like, "I know she's down here.

424
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,480
I can feel her."

425
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,360
If she is in there, are you sure
you want to see her like this?

426
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,760
Ryan and I can handle it.

427
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,440
Thanks, but I owe it to her
not to run away and hide.

428
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,280
This has the schematics

429
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,600
for the tunnel system
below the Batcave.

430
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,760
I have no idea
where we're going to end up

431
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,320
so make sure we find our way back.

432
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,920
How far down does this go?

433
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,600
Even closer to hell than your office.

434
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,000
Okay, I need total quiet.

435
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,760
Sorry, guys.

436
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,160
Damn fraud alert on my credit card...

437
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,840
Silencing.

438
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,000
I think I got something.

439
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,160
Trying to isolate it.

440
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,280
Okay, I'm locked in.

441
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,440
I can hear it clear enough
to track the source.

442
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,640
- Hear what?
- Pam's heartbeat.

443
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,200
- Oh, my god.
- You have the device?

444
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,440
- Yeah, I...
- Then we need to move.

445
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,560
Whatever Mary's up to

446
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,960
she doesn't stay
in one place for long.

447
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,600
Luke, we think Pam's somewhere
in the lower tunnels.

448
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,200
<i>That is actually brilliant.</i>

449
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,160
<i>But a lot of solid rock down there.
So we might lose contact.</i>

450
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,520
Keep Mary there. Help is on the way.

451
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Let's go.

452
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,440
So I keep wondering two things,
why are you here?

453
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,960
And where's Wilder?

454
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,720
You're seriously thinking
about your sister right now?

455
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,320
So you expect me to think
that I could steal her company

456
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,000
and she's just cool with it?

457
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,800
It's honestly kind of annoying

458
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,400
how much clinginess
runs in your family.

459
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,080
You want to know why Ryan
isn't paying attention to you?

460
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,640
It's because she's too obsessed
with "fixing" me.

461
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,160
You don't look broken to me.

462
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,200
Look...

463
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,160
Long story short, I just want
to move on with my life

464
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,400
with the one person left
who understands me.

465
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,240
But then I thought to myself

466
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,680
this Marquis guy
has a lot of weird baggage.

467
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,800
Maybe he wants to take revenge
on Ryan on my behalf?

468
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,040
What did you have in mind?

469
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,120
Well, look who stopped talking.

470
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,200
A little bonus for you.

471
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,600
It might help open up some doors
for you in the future.

472
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,000
Ryan, are we hot or cold?

473
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,720
Tell me we're scalding because
we're almost at the end of the map.

474
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,440
Well, it's getting louder,
I just don't know how much further.

475
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,800
<i>To Batwoman, Mary and Marquis...</i>

476
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,640
Luke? Luke? You copy?

477
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
Damn.

478
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,200
Okay, there's something's going on
with Mary upstairs.

479
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,040
- We're almost out of time.
- Guys.

480
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
Tell me she had
a charming personality.

481
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,960
That's the desiccation.

482
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,720
The serum leeches water
from the cells

483
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,160
includes skin and tissue.

484
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,720
And you wanna do this to Mary?

485
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,920
I'm trying
to prevent a poison ivy outbreak

486
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,480
from wiping out Gotham's
best and brightest upstairs.

487
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,960
Look, Ryan, I was you once.

488
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,400
I wanted to believe
that there was some magical solution

489
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,520
where I save the love of my life
without her hating me forever.

490
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,720
There isn't.

491
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,920
Mary is at the party.
The serum is here.

492
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,880
It's time to step up.

493
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,800
All right. Got it.

494
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,640
Hey, Luke, if you can hear me,
I'm headed up.

495
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,920
We're coming with you.

496
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,720
Stay and make sure
Pam doesn't wake up.

497
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,360
I'll check in once Mary's down.

498
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,840
Remember, no water breaks

499
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,040
and if you so much as have to sneeze,
don't.

500
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,760
Just in case.

501
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,480
Batwoman, if you copy,
I lost eyes on Mary.

502
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,600
Where are you?

503
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,560
- Didn't know you were coming.
- Get the hell off me, man.

504
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,040
I don't think
you should be talking like that.

505
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,480
You're not wearing the right costume.

506
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
What are you talking about?

507
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,160
See, I just wonder where you keep it.

508
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,120
Does it plug into
like a Tesla charger?

509
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,320
I don't have time for this.

510
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
Well, I think you do, Batwing.

511
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
She'd forgive you.

512
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,320
You have no clue
how much of a fighter she was.

513
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,800
I'm talking about Pam.

514
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,320
The woman you tell in love with.

515
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,760
Not Poison Ivy.

516
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,640
For the record, I take half the blame
for Alice going free.

517
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,760
Not the wisest move on my part.

518
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
We'll find her.

519
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,120
She'll screw up eventually.
Ping a traffic cam, rob a bank.

520
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,640
Alice?
More like hold-up a doughnut shop.

521
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,000
Oh, my God.

522
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,960
The fraud alert.

523
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,040
Whoever stole my card

524
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,320
they purchased
a three-tier strawberry cheesecake

525
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,160
and a grape soda,
then had it sent to her hotel room.

526
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,480
And you think it was Alice?

527
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,520
Knowing her,
she won't be there much longer.

528
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I need to get her back.
Are you good here?

529
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,720
Doesn't look like she's re-animating.
I'll be fine.

530
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Be careful.

531
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,800
Sorry, ma'am.
Elevators are temporarily down.

532
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,080
All of them? Why?

533
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,360
Just some hiccup
with the building computer system.

534
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,680
We'll get you on your way shortly.

535
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,360
Oh, Ryan, when will you give up?

536
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,440
The stairs are better for my calves
anyway.

537
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,400
Took you long enough.

538
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Cake?

539
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,120
I believe you'll get 5% cashback.

540
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,280
You lured me here?

541
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,840
Lured you?

542
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,040
Let's not get kinky.

543
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,440
Alice, what the hell is this?

544
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,040
I made a juicy discovery.

545
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,480
And I've been dying to tell you

546
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,080
but you've been so hard to get alone
lately.

547
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,640
Honestly, I don't know
what's happened to our friendship.

548
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,760
We don't have one, for starters.

549
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,960
Besides the point.

550
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,400
You have been so kind

551
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,160
to house me on that prison cot
you call a pull-out couch

552
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,120
I just wanted to return the favor.

553
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,120
Your little lover
has been playing us.

554
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,600
- Renee?
- Sure.

555
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,560
Or whatever you call her
under the sheets.

556
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,720
Since when do you do me favors?

557
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,160
Because Re-nay-nay is a liar.

558
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,520
And she needs to pay
for being a bad one.

559
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,880
Says the world's biggest liar.

560
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,600
You know, Renee's huge mistake
was leaving me alone in her office.

561
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,560
Did she not think
I would snoop every nook and cranny?

562
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,680
Left cabinet. Second drawer down.

563
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,200
See for yourself.

564
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,640
I don't want to hurt you, Mary.

565
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,800
There's another promise broken.

566
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
What's in that?

567
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,280
Do you even know?

568
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,080
Batman made it to stop Poison Ivy.

569
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,720
When? A decade ago?

570
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,960
Do you even know the half-life
of its chemical compound?

571
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,440
You don't even know
what that will do to me, do you?

572
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,400
You gave me no choice.

573
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Batwoman, hold up,
you ready for me to blow your mind?

574
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,160
How about we kill your two
little sidekicks at the same time?

575
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,840
A little brother-sister
bonding action?

576
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,080
Come on.

577
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
It was me.

578
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,480
I told him.

579
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,720
So you don't have to put yourself

580
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,120
on the "I don't know
what you're talking about" phase.

581
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,160
Mary, how could you?

582
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,600
You gave me no choice.

583
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,320
I always wondered

584
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,040
why I was the kid that got chosen
on that bus that day.

585
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,200
Couple dozen kids,
so why was I the one who got buzzed?

586
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,200
Everyone says the world's gone mad,
but I get it.

587
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,240
Batman had the Joker.

588
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,440
And Batwoman, you got me.

589
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,240
True or false, sis.
You gotta trust destiny.

590
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
False.

591
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,400
We make our own destinies.

592
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,120
You wish.

593
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,360
I've been in the bathroom

594
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,480
trying to finagle my way
out of Sophie's handcuffs

595
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,000
and you've been in here
drinking all the Dom?

596
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,240
Ryan had me beat.

597
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,560
She was about to inject me
with something.

598
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,800
And then she hesitated.

599
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,040
Whatever she was about to do to me
scared her.

600
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,280
Don't tell me you're getting
the conscience tingles.

601
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,000
Before I even knew
what was happening

602
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,560
she used the syringe on Marquis.

603
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,480
I don't know if it was to save Luke
or to protect her secret.

604
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
But...

605
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,560
all I know is, in that moment...

606
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,280
I was the least of her problems.

607
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,160
She still underestimates you.

608
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,280
I know it's silly...

609
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,680
but a part of me just wanted her
to see me as powerful.

610
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,720
Do you know those
loony tune delusions I was having?

611
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,200
Postcards from Dad,
imaginary friends

612
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,960
walking in on Sophie in the shower?

613
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,440
That last one happened.

614
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,440
Anyway, since your whole
Poison Mary metamorphosis

615
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,000
I have yet to have
a single delusional thought.

616
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,000
Which means babysitting you, my dear,
has made me less of a crazy person.

617
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,560
And if that's not powerful,
I don't know what is.

618
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,520
I know you can't hear me.

619
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,880
I know you hate me.

620
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,760
But I am sorry.

621
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,920
I've been sorry every day
I wake up to a badge and not to you.

622
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,560
Oh, my God.

623
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Pam?

624
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,120
Pam, can you hear me?

625
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Pam.

626
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,640
Oh, my God.

627
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,520
Desiccation is not pretty.

628
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,560
Do you think we should hook him
up to fluids?

629
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,920
Unless you want him to wake up.

630
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,800
He knows who we are.

631
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,840
The second he wakes up,
the whole world will too.

632
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,200
Yeah.
That's a big fat "if he wakes up."

633
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,720
<i>Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice message system.</i>

634
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,480
Jada Jet. This is Batwoman.

635
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
I have your son.

636
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,200
If you're looking for a way
to fix his brain

637
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,760
I suggest you find it quick.

638
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
Sophie?

639
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,600
How do you have reception
in the tunnels?

640
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,920
I'm not in the tunnels.
But you need to get there ASAP.

641
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,040
Sophie, where's Renee?

642
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
You know why you and Alice

643
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,960
haven't been able to cross
the joy buzzer off her list?

644
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,040
Renee has had it this entire time.

645
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,200
What do you mean she had it?

646
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,400
<i>I mean she was never
going to let Alice free.</i>

647
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,920
She lied, Ryan.

648
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,440
<i>To Alice, to you, to me.</i>

649
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,040
<i>She was holding it over your heads</i>

650
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,000
<i>until one of you
found what she wanted.</i>

651
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
<i>Her soulmate.</i>

652
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,520
<i>Pamela Isley.</i>
