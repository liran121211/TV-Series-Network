1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,800
Okay. Get on her, get on her!

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,920
Go!

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay...

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,760
Shakes her defender

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,920
pulls up from way downtown,
fires, and...

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,120
misses, oh.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,320
- Brick City, baby.
- Shut up.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,560
Yo, come on, let's go.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,640
Hang on a second.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
What the...

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,720
Oh, hell, no!

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,480
Help. Help me.

13
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, my God.

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,920
You're standing
on the freaking evidence.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,680
Ma'am, this area is off-limits.

16
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,320
{\an5}I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just call me "ma'am"

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,080
{\an5}and instead ask you to leave.

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,360
This case belongs to City Hall now.

19
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,120
Pack it up, boys.
Freak Patrol's on the scene.

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,720
{\an5}Her ambiguous yet far-reaching power
supersedes ours.

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,280
Miss you too, detective.

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,320
- All right, let's go.
- Take him to the clinic on Bennett.

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Ask for Mary Hamilton.

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,320
{\an5}Who is it now, Montoya?
Pollen Boy? Candyman?

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,080
{\an5}Tell the commissioner to prep
for all hands on deck.

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,520
Things are about to get ugly
around here.

27
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,000
Victim is Chris Hayner.

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,760
Tricorner resident found encased
in a beehive in Robinson Park.

29
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,120
{\an5}You think someone
went through the trouble

30
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,920
{\an5}of filling a shed with flowers
to draw in bees

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,560
{\an5}to, what, sting this guy to death?

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,480
{\an5}I think the perp literally bloomed
the flowers themselves

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,720
{\an5}weaponizing the natural world
around them.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,280
What am I missing?

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
Poison Ivy.

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,680
{\an5}More specifically, her new host.

37
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,840
{\an5}Alice turned over Ivy's vine
to me yesterday.

38
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,160
{\an5}It was dead, meaning
it had already infected someone.

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,280
I think whoever did this
is that someone.

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
How did you get Poison Ivy's vine?

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,720
{\an5}While you were slurping caviar
off of Mommy's fine china

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,400
{\an5}some of us were in the field,
protecting this city.

43
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,680
{\an5}And you just so happen
to stumble across a Batman trophy

44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,520
{\an5}while you were taking a stroll
through the park.

45
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,440
The cherry blossoms are so gorgeous
this time of year.

46
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,000
{\an5}Trust me, I already tried
to get it out of her.

47
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,840
{\an5}Why aren't you telling me
what you're not telling me?

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,480
You lost me on the double negative.

49
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,280
Guys, we don't have time for this.

50
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Trust me, I tried.

51
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,120
{\an5}Found the vic's phone at the scene.
It's passcode-protected.

52
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,560
{\an5}But I think there's a good chance
he had contact

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,680
{\an5}with whoever did this to him.

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,680
My computer can crack his passcode.

55
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,840
Good. I told Mary Hamilton to give me
a call as soon as our vic wakes up.

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,480
You sent him to Mary Hamilton?

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,120
{\an5}She's been overseeing
all the River Rogue cases.

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
Is there a problem?

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,520
{\an5}No. No problem at all.

60
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,320
{\an5}In fact, Mary Hamilton
is the perfect person

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,760
to help us with this case.

62
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,280
I'm gonna go check
on the vic's progress.

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,640
{\an5}Because you care about
a stranger's life all of a sudden?

64
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,400
{\an5}You're right. I don't.

65
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,760
Let's you and I go sit
in the Batcave together

66
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,880
{\an5}and watch the computer
tediously cycle

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,200
{\an5}through all
the anti-encryption ciphers.

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,120
Have fun with Mary.

69
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,520
Will do.

70
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,920
Sophie, make yourself at home.

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,880
Sorry. Hope you don't mind.

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,640
Alice spilled cherry soda
all over my laptop.

73
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,440
Besides, you have more eyes
in this city than I do.

74
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,440
Black Glove's mercenaries
stay invisible

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,280
by doing things
the old-fashioned way.

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,440
They're off the grid,
they're off the cloud.

77
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,440
Surprised
they used electricity at all.

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,840
Found this surveillance
of Jordan's attacker

79
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,360
leaving her apartment,
but I lost him a block later.

80
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,120
So you're waiting for him
to show up on cameras again?

81
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,920
Unless your mom
miraculously came clean

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
and offered up her Rolodex?

83
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,160
I figured when you didn't call
last night

84
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
confronting her
about what these guys

85
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,040
did to my sister was a dead end.

86
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,120
So it's just you and me
and Crispy Joe's wontons.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,640
My mom wasn't responsible
for what happened to Jordan.

88
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,040
And you believe her?

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
You believe her.

90
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,120
And now, I need you to believe me.

91
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
My mom isn't the monster
you think she is.

92
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,880
I think you should drop it.

93
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,560
Ryan, my sister had evidence.

94
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,560
I mean, a drawing
of Victor Fries' cryochamber

95
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,240
was faxed
directly to your mom's office.

96
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,280
I am not saying
she didn't initiate the project.

97
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,480
So you're saying she is involved.

98
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,040
I am saying that Jada promised me
she had no idea

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,560
people were going to get hurt.

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,640
And that's good enough?

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
Three of Jordan's friends died

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,880
because of your mom's involvement
with the freeze serum.

103
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,600
Jordan is still in recovery.

104
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,960
What happened was horrible.

105
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,000
I am not saying it's okay.

106
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,200
Then, why aren't you wondering why?

107
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,200
And why does she want it?
And why aren't you stopping her?

108
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,960
Because it's complicated.

109
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,720
I promise you, I will tell you
everything when I can.

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,600
When you can?

111
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,240
Ryan, it's me.

112
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,360
What does she have over you?

113
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,240
Let me help. I can get you out of it.

114
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
She doesn't have anything over me.

115
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,280
Then, why are you protecting her?

116
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Sophie.

117
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,800
I just need you to trust me on this.

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,000
- Because she's your mom.
- It's not that simple.

119
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Oh, really?

120
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,480
Because you're making it sound
pretty freaking simple.

121
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,160
Tell me there's a jar of this
somewhere.

122
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Why did Batwoman send you here
to torture me?

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,360
Oh, she didn't. I volunteered.

124
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,840
Of course, you did.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,920
Apparently, this is the work
of a Poison Ivy wannabe.

126
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,560
The question is, what kind of monster
would entomb a man

127
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,880
in a swarm of ravenous bees?

128
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,720
You know it's bad
if it makes me cringe.

129
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,920
Oh, I have an idea.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,600
Why don't you leave and go find out?

131
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,160
That's the thing, steppy.

132
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,480
I think I already know
who this disturbed creature is.

133
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
You.

134
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,520
I see.

135
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,440
You're having delusions again.

136
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,840
And instead of admitting it
like a normal person

137
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,760
you're gaslighting me
to avoid being vulnerable

138
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,160
when I tell you I stopped caring.

139
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,280
Oh, sweet, naive Mary.

140
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,520
Look around.

141
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,040
You've turned your clinic
into <i>Jumanji.</i>

142
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,200
You're downing water

143
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,120
like you just ran
the Gotham City Marathon.

144
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,880
And if you think that
that is anything

145
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,640
other than a Poison Ivy rash

146
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,040
you should give back
that shiny medical degree.

147
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,960
Seriously? Look at me.

148
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,640
I'm Dr. Mary Hamilton.

149
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,880
You actually think
I'm capable of hurting anyone?

150
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,080
Much less doing this?

151
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,200
Chris?

152
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Chris? It's okay. You're safe now.

153
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,480
- Help me!
- Hey, relax.

154
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,160
Please... get away from me.

155
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Chris, I'm your doctor.
You're safe now.

156
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm taking care of you.

157
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,680
Taking care of me?

158
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,280
You did this to me.

159
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,520
As I was saying?

160
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,520
Okay, team meeting
in the literal dead of the night.

161
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
So why are we here?

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,840
So you know how we have
the Bat Team rules

163
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,720
and the first rule is holding
each other accountable.

164
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,920
Yeah.

165
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,080
So...

166
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,360
So...

167
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm...

168
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,080
You're...

169
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,960
Oh, wow, I thought watching Kate
come out was torture.

170
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,400
Wait, you're coming out?

171
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,840
What? No.

172
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,880
Oh, in a way.

173
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,320
I'm not coming out
because I'm not gay.

174
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,800
But that's beside the point.

175
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,400
Mary, my God.

176
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,640
I'm Poison Ivy.

177
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,680
And I know
what you all must be thinking.

178
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,160
"Mary, that's impossible

179
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,280
because you're so normal
and compassionate.

180
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,760
So how could you become

181
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,200
some plant-whispering
attempted murderer?"

182
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,480
Then I realized I can't even remember
where I was earlier today.

183
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
It's because I was
in some fugue state

184
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,200
torturing Chris Hayner,
who I don't even know.

185
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,080
I'm sorry. What?

186
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,560
See, that little worker bee
in the hive

187
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,680
when he cracked his eyes open

188
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,320
he blamed Queen Mary
for turning him into an EpiPen ad.

189
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,520
Then he's seeing things.

190
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,960
I mean, his eyes
were practically swollen shut.

191
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,840
And he'd just experienced
a major trauma.

192
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,040
Okay, then explain
my sudden obsession with plants.

193
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,400
You're a doctor. You care for things.

194
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,960
Or my sudden, constant,
unquenchable thirst.

195
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,360
You're dehydrated.

196
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,520
Mary, you work in the clinic
all day and night

197
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,480
you don't eat or sleep

198
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,800
and you're always putting
everyone's needs before your own...

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,040
Guys?

200
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
Why were Chris Hayner's
last three texts

201
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,280
to Mary this morning?

202
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,000
And we're all on the same page.

203
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,160
Well, that wasn't
an excruciating process.

204
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,040
You knew Mary was infected
by the vine.

205
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,160
That's why you're being so coy
in Montoya's office.

206
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,160
I just figured
the last thing anyone needed

207
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,680
was for Mary to end up
on Renee's wall of weird.

208
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,040
Oh, muting the boss.

209
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
I'm sure that's gonna end
really well.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,400
Montoya doesn't need to know
anything about this.

211
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,120
Okay. I see.

212
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,720
It's fine when we throw Alice
in Arkham

213
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,240
but, oh, poor, sweet, innocent Mary.

214
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,480
Yeah, we should protect her
at all costs.

215
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,240
What are you doing?

216
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,960
What one does when they realize

217
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,160
they can control
Mother-freaking-Earth.

218
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,280
I nearly killed someone
and I don't know why

219
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,560
or when this infection
is gonna make me transform again.

220
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,080
And until we figure it out,
I am a threat to everyone.

221
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,000
- So I'm staying right here.
- (Not me.)

222
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,960
Well, you can take the girl
out of the GCPD.

223
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
Looks like you got the same partner.

224
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,000
Sophie Moore.

225
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,600
Only a fellow workaholic would assume
I'd be at the office at 2.00am.

226
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,040
This is an office?

227
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
Wouldn't have guessed.

228
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,440
I mean, I thought Detective Montoya

229
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,320
was on track
to be the next commissioner.

230
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,760
Now, you're sharing a basement
with a leaky pipe? Ouch.

231
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,360
At least I have a job.

232
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,480
I quit The Crows by choice.

233
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,200
Right before Kane's own agents
tried to kill him?

234
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Oh, real profile in courage.

235
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,960
I'm here to let you return a favor.

236
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,440
Oh, excuse me. Then, please, go on.

237
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,400
I'd love to hear
what you've done for me

238
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,760
other than flash your Crows badge
to steal my best cases.

239
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,760
If I weren't willing to babysit Alice

240
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,560
you'd never be able to prove
to the mayor

241
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,520
that you're capable of collecting
all these Batman weapons.

242
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,840
And we both know, without Alice

243
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,080
none of these cases
are getting solved.

244
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,560
Fine. I'll bite. What?

245
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,400
Someone experimented on my sister

246
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,200
with a variant of Victor Fries's
freeze serum.

247
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,120
I need all the data
your Task Force collected

248
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,520
on Fries and that serum.

249
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,240
We don't have half
of what Batwoman does.

250
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,920
Aren't you pals?
Go shine a flashlight in the air.

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,560
I would. Except we're not
seeing eye to eye on this.

252
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,720
Drama.

253
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
You want me to get two straws?

254
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,840
What do you know about
the Black Glove society?

255
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,240
Specifically him.

256
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
This guy led the experiments.

257
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,960
Is your sister okay?

258
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,160
Do you actually care?

259
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,720
If your sister survived
what they did to her

260
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,280
then I'd count my lucky stars.

261
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,440
And then I'd forget
I ever heard of Black Glove.

262
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,560
Well, what do you know?

263
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,120
Absolutely nothing.

264
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,400
Except that everyone who knows
anything about Black Glove

265
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,080
usually ends up dead.

266
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,520
Be careful, Moore.

267
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,120
There are worse things
than ending up like me.

268
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,600
Do you remember meeting him
on Twinge?

269
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
I didn't even know I was on Twinge.

270
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,880
I've never seen this guy before
in my life.

271
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,520
Are your eyes green
in your profile picture?

272
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,000
No. I think it's just bad lighting.

273
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,800
Maybe he was stalking me

274
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,280
or maybe he was some date rape guy
and I found out about it.

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,880
It seems like
he just wasn't that into you.

276
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,640
Yeah, according to your DMs,
which I merely skimmed for keywords

277
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,360
he said you seemed...

278
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
sweet.

279
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,000
So you suffocated him in honey.
Clever girl.

280
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,080
I think I wanna date Poison Ivy Mary.

281
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Hold on.

282
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,040
Rejection?

283
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,360
I almost took an innocent man's life.

284
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,600
Okay, Mary's right.

285
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,560
That's a pretty screwed-up reason
to nearly drown a guy.

286
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,320
I don't know.

287
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,720
Is it though?

288
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,920
I mean, I've never been accused
of being sweet

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,600
but it's basically like saying,
you know

290
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,520
"You're pleasant
but instantly forgettable."

291
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,120
It's like the "beige" of compliments.

292
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,800
- The "swipe left" of niceties...
- We get it.

293
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,080
You don't really think
that's how people see you, right?

294
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,760
Hey, do you remember going
to a hardware store this morning?

295
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Should I?

296
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,480
Well, you bought a flowering pot,
fertilizer, and a watering can.

297
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,840
And according to your phone's
geo data

298
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,880
once you left the store,
you went to a vacant lot in Burnside.

299
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,920
Please don't tell me
I hurt anyone else.

300
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,000
Why didn't you say anything
about Mary?

301
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
I was wondering
how this would end up my fault.

302
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,640
Obviously, you knew something was up.
How did you figure it out?

303
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,440
The question isn't
how I figured it out.

304
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,240
It's how the hell you didn't.
You're her roommate.

305
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,400
You have a billion dollars
of Bat Tech at your disposal.

306
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,360
And your number two
is a certifiable genius.

307
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,920
One of you should have noticed.

308
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,920
Fertilizer bag is empty

309
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,280
but the ground's not disturbed.

310
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,560
Nothing was planted.

311
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,120
Why was Mary here?

312
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,440
Mary Hamilton, you dirty girl.

313
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,880
He's still alive.

314
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Oh, well, it's only her first day.

315
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,640
- Wonder what this guy did to Mary.
- I don't know

316
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,360
but he tried to kill Sophie and me
and freeze Sophie's sister.

317
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,920
Somehow Mary managed to turn

318
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,600
one of Black Glove's
most dangerous operatives

319
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,320
into a garden turnip.

320
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,400
I'm not sure if that's impressive
or just really, really bad.

321
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,880
I don't suppose you have a Bat-shovel
on that belt.

322
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,320
Sorry, how did I track down
an elusive black-ops organization?

323
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
You tracked the PO box
Virgil Getty was using

324
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,800
through the company that sold him
the cryogenic medical supplies

325
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,600
that he used
on the freeze serum victims.

326
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,280
Sophie's been a bloodhound
with this guy.

327
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,560
I'm sure she tried that.

328
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,520
Yeah, well, Sophie doesn't have an MD
after her name.

329
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,520
Looks like
Dr. Hamilton used her title

330
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,480
to bypass privacy laws.

331
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,640
Violation of medical ethics?

332
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,320
Harley Quinn, here you come.

333
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,840
Perhaps someone should tell Sophie

334
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,240
that the guy
who tried to burn us alive

335
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
and freeze her sister to death

336
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,680
is hanging from a sewer pipe
under Wayne?

337
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,080
No, we have enough problems
without Sophie finding more.

338
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,240
Well, "Moore" is literally her name.

339
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,400
And as a victim of Sophie's backhand,
I'd say she can handle herself.

340
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,360
I said she stays out of it.

341
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,280
Okay.

342
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,600
Can we go back to me freaking out

343
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,040
over the fact that I'm turning
into an uber-villain against my will?

344
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,720
Why is this happening?

345
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,680
Poison Ivy is an eco-terrorist.

346
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Neither of your victims

347
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,200
had any public record
of actively hurting the environment.

348
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah, but the Bat-villain weapons
don't necessarily mean the same MO.

349
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,960
Liam Crandle
didn't have the same agenda

350
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,400
as the OG Mad Hatter.

351
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,080
That's a good point.

352
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,480
Chris called you sweet,
you dipped him in honey.

353
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,040
Virgil froze Jordan

354
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,200
so you used Mother Nature
to immobilize him.

355
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,080
So maybe the chemical pheromones
from the poison ivy

356
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,680
allow me to communicate with nature

357
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,240
while heightening the things
that I'm passionate about?

358
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,440
Like justice?

359
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,240
Well, seeing as the MO tracks
and I killed your mother

360
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm really not looking forward
to being turned into a cabbage.

361
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,480
So we should find out exactly
what turns Dr. Jekyll

362
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,880
into
Mrs. Hide-My-Victims-Under-A-Pot.

363
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,440
Damn it.

364
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,040
What does she want?

365
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,200
You, my dear.

366
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,960
Dead or alive.

367
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,920
Making house calls now?

368
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,280
Why didn't you tell me
you found another Poison Ivy vic?

369
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,760
It's 5 in the morning.
I figured you were asleep.

370
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,160
I don't sleep, Ryan.

371
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,960
Especially when someone's out there
with Pam's abilities.

372
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,920
- Where's the vic?
- In my custody.

373
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,360
Yeah, well, I need to talk to him.

374
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,360
I need to know what he saw,
what he knows.

375
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,160
He's unconscious at the moment.

376
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,160
When he's talking, I will call you.

377
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
Oh, just like Chris Hayner?

378
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,040
Is that a coincidence
or a convenience?

379
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,640
You wanted to partner
with Batwoman, right?

380
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,160
<i>Then you need to trust my process.</i>

381
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,880
Ryan is flail-ling.

382
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,520
What did you mean
Renee wanted me dead or alive?

383
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,200
Renee and Poison Pam
have a backstory.

384
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,240
What kind of backstory?

385
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,640
I don't wanna be a gossip.

386
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,560
- Spill.
- Spill.

387
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
If you insist.

388
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,440
So...

389
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,080
They met, fell madly in love.

390
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,440
Kissy...

391
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,160
Then Pam fell victim
to some evil scientist's experiment.

392
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,960
Obviously, Pam's metamorphosis
into <i>Little Shop of Horrors</i>

393
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,120
got in the way of sexy time

394
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,920
which was big problem for Renee
as she was a GCPD detective.

395
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,520
Crisis of the heart. Boring...

396
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Ultimately, Renee called Batman

397
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,000
who convinced her to lure
the love of her life into his trap.

398
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,120
Why would someone
infected with poison ivy

399
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
target a Black Glove operative?

400
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,480
It doesn't makes sense

401
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,560
unless he had a personal connection
to him.

402
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,960
If I knew, I would tell you.

403
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Would you?

404
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,480
Because I'm beginning to feel like
you're hiding things from me, Ryan.

405
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,920
Where's the vic?

406
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,800
<i>That's really intense.</i>

407
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,760
So Renee sold out
the love of her life to Batman?

408
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,480
And he buried her deep underground

409
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,000
away from water and sunlight
to shrivel up and not die.

410
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,560
Can you imagine going without
that skin cream for all those years?

411
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,200
Imagine what she'd do
to someone she barely even knows.

412
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,520
Okay. I think Mary's heard enough.

413
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,960
What? I'm not trying to scare her.

414
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,000
It's just Liam ended up in Arkham.

415
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,160
Killer Croc in a cage

416
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,440
and Nora Fries
would rather face death

417
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,440
over being held captive again.

418
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,400
I just think
we are doing ourselves a disservice

419
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,680
to deny the predictable outcome

420
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,800
of anyone who comes in contact
with Batman's trophies.

421
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,160
As a girl who spent
over a decade of her life

422
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,560
locked in a small room

423
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,040
I just want you to avoid
ending up the way they did.

424
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,000
Watching the woman I love

425
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,800
go from this compassionate,
selfless person

426
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,520
into this thing that could justify
killing dozens of people

427
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
it broke me, Ryan.

428
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,000
And now she's infected someone else.

429
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,880
To... To pretend like
I don't know how this ends

430
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,360
to not do everything in my power
to stop it.

431
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,680
It wouldn't be fair to me,
to this city

432
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,080
or to the Pam I used to know.

433
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,960
Just call me when your guy wakes up.

434
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,160
We need to figure out
what my trigger is.

435
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,160
Maybe it's a word
or a series of words.

436
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,640
Actually,
I'm starting to feel a little funny.

437
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,560
Okay. Funny how?

438
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,040
My vision's a little blurry.

439
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,920
Okay. Maybe you're dehydrated.

440
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,720
Renee's on my ass.

441
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,240
We don't have a lot of time
to figure this out.

442
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,680
We could ask Sophie to ask Virgil

443
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,240
if he said or did anything
that triggered Mary.

444
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,880
Sophie's not with Virgil.

445
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,880
What did you do?

446
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,680
So...

447
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,520
Sophie has been a great roommate.

448
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,200
You know, she puts my dishes away.

449
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,600
She cleans my clothes
with that fabric softener

450
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,280
that doesn't irritate
my sensitive skin.

451
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,160
Alice, what did you do?

452
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,880
Sophie really wanted
to interrogate Virgil

453
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,840
and I didn't want to keep secrets
from my roomie.

454
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,680
You're an idiot.

455
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,840
You have no idea
what you've just done.

456
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,080
So sue me for having guilt
for once in my life.

457
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,200
Seriously, just stop talking.

458
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
I don't get it.

459
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,120
Why can't Sophie know
where Virgil is?

460
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,920
I'll be back.
Call me if anything changes here.

461
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,080
Where are you going?

462
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,200
To stop Sophie
from making a huge mistake.

463
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,080
Hello again.

464
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,760
I know.

465
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,520
You thought you burned me alive.

466
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,360
But nope, I lived.

467
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,800
To do the same to you.

468
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,880
I've got some questions
about your employer.

469
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Who hired you to take my sister?

470
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Let me rephrase that.

471
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,560
Was it Jada Jet?

472
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,880
Technically, I was hired
by Marla Elliot decades ago.

473
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,880
Elliot. As in Tommy Elliot?

474
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,080
His mother.

475
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,080
Thought Tommy had
behavioral problems.

476
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,480
Well, she got that right

477
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,280
since he turned
into that psycho, Hush.

478
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,840
Before that, she formed a group
of other parents with bad seed kids.

479
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,320
Swapped horror stories,
discussed treatments, meds, whatever.

480
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,120
Like secret group therapy
for rich people

481
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
to talk about their screwed-up kids.

482
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,000
I don't know of any self-help groups
that employ a militia.

483
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,160
They're called Black Glove
because they don't leave a trace.

484
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Titans of industry
spending millions on R&D

485
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,560
to fix their kids' brains?

486
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,760
Not great for public image.

487
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,880
Yeah, and neither
is injecting twenty-somethings

488
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
with fatal freeze serum.

489
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,760
My clients would agree with you.

490
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,880
Which is exactly why we clean up
after ourselves.

491
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,080
My sister nearly died!

492
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,880
Three of her friends did!

493
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,800
Why? What does Jada want?

494
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Enough!

495
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,200
Seriously?

496
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,480
I have to find out from Alice
that you found this guy?

497
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,240
I said I would tell you everything.

498
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,480
When?

499
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,840
When it's safe.

500
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,040
Safe from what?

501
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,840
Safe from what, Ryan?

502
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,640
From her? From Jada? Who?

503
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,760
Sorry.

504
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,840
You want my trust?
You're gonna have to earn it.

505
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,760
Because right now, it looks like
you're taking the side of a woman

506
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,240
who sanctioned murder over me,
your actual friend.

507
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,120
No, no, no!

508
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,080
He's dead.

509
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,240
Guess you get to keep
mommy's secret a little longer.

510
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,480
When Bruce met Pam Isley,
she was Poison Ivy 24/7.

511
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,480
Well, wherever he put her
obviously contained her, right?

512
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,080
Maybe the key is figuring out
how he did that.

513
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,720
This is before my time
but from what he told the press

514
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,440
they put her in a place
no one would ever find her.

515
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,600
It doesn't even affect you
anymore, does it?

516
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,360
What doesn't affect me?

517
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,760
Oh, being second fiddle

518
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,880
to whatever other dramas
going on in Ryan's life.

519
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,760
Wow, you know what, it's funny.

520
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,760
I don't think we actually
need you here anymore.

521
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,880
Alice, so if you like

522
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,560
to go sniff your fluff and fold,
now would be a great time.

523
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,760
Are neither of you concerned?

524
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,560
That our leader, Batwoman,
left her bestie

525
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,200
infected, vulnerable, terrified
to go "help" a woman

526
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,840
who literally shares a bedroom wall
with a serial killer.

527
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,320
She knows what she's doing.

528
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,160
Oh, I know she knows
what she's doing.

529
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,520
But do you know what she's doing?

530
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,440
See, Ryan doesn't care about
protecting Sophie from Virgil, no.

531
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,200
She cares about protecting
Virgil from Sophie.

532
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,480
Specifically, his secrets.

533
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,680
Presumably, because
they're about her mother.

534
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,560
A woman whose needs she,
once again, prioritizes

535
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,680
- over the Bat Team.
- Ryan, wouldn't do that.

536
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,600
She already did, Luke.

537
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,360
Which has me wondering
if it's only a matter of time

538
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,680
before Ryan waltzes
into Renee's office

539
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,040
with Mary in bat cuffs.

540
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,280
Are you joking?

541
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,960
Ryan wouldn't arrest her best friend.

542
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,320
She's gonna find a way to fix this.

543
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Good morning, sunshine.

544
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,960
I was wondering
when you'd come out to play.

545
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,080
You figured out
sunlight was my trigger.

546
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,120
Well, they don't call me
a supervillain for nothing.

547
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,880
But Batty will be home soon

548
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,240
so I hope you know what you're doing.

549
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,000
Why are you helping me?

550
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,320
Well, why does anyone help anyone?

551
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,720
To accrue favors owed.

552
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,400
But until I redeem this one,
I need you to be careful.

553
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,360
Once you slither out
of this Batcave...

554
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,560
Renee Montoya's gonna
be hunting you down

555
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,720
like a gardener with a weed whacker.

556
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,120
<i>- Montoya.</i>
- Oh, hi.

557
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,040
Someone told me to call this number

558
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,120
with a possible tip
about Poison Ivy's sighting.

559
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,520
<i>Where are you? I'll be right there.</i>

560
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,920
Gotham City Botanical Gardens.

561
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,720
Renee Montoya.

562
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,560
Mary?

563
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,520
You need to get out of here,
it's not safe.

564
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,760
Trust me, I'm well aware.

565
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,200
Nowhere around you is safe, Renee.

566
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
Who are you?

567
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,920
I'm the one who called in the tip.

568
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,040
Virgil's dead, Alice.
I hope you're happy.

569
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,880
- Luke? Luke.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

570
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,680
What happened?
Did Alice do something with Mary?

571
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,000
- The sunlight.
- What?

572
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,920
Sunlight is her trigger.

573
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
She's not Mary anymore.

574
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,280
Where did you get infected?
At the park? The river?

575
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,640
Where was the vine, Mary?

576
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,720
It's not a homing pigeon
for the brokenhearted, Ray-Ray.

577
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,880
You don't whisper "Pamela Isley"
into the leaves

578
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,920
and follow as it slithers its way
to her secret burial site.

579
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,640
And you know about Pam?

580
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,040
Enough to know that
she doesn't want you to find her.

581
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,600
Look, you need to come with me
so I can get you help.

582
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,400
Is that what I need?

583
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,920
Did you use that soft, gentle tone
to lure Poison Pam into captivity?

584
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,240
No.

585
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,960
She was out of control.

586
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,760
And you're not there yet,
let's keep it that way.

587
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,960
What do you think she thinks about
down there.

588
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,080
I mean, besides freedom and water

589
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,880
and how her veins scrape together
like sandpaper.

590
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,320
Easy.

591
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,640
Let's not make this ugly.

592
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,760
She thinks about how much
she hates you, Renee.

593
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,080
Mary, come with me now
and no one will get hurt.

594
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,520
Or stay. And only you do.

595
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,640
Mary, please don't do this.

596
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,600
Mary's phone just pinged
at the old Gotham Botanical gardens.

597
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,160
- I need to get there.
- I'm coming with you.

598
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,920
I thought you said
you weren't ready to wear the suit.

599
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,600
Actually, my dad decided that.

600
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
I may not be ready to wear the suit,

601
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
but I'm not ready to lose Mary,
either.

602
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,280
My dad will understand.

603
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,960
If he doesn't, I'm sure
I'll hear about it on the way.

604
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,160
Let's get out of here.

605
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,560
I'm reading some sort of energy here.

606
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,400
Yeah, definitely picking up

607
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,360
one abnormally high thermo presence
in these trees.

608
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,200
You feel like you're being watched?

609
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,320
Tiny bit.

610
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
Yellow roses.

611
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,360
Yellow roses symbolize friendship.

612
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,640
Mary knows us better than anyone.
She knew we'd track her phone.

613
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,840
Do you think
she wants us to find her?

614
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,720
I think she want to draw us out.

615
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,760
Batwoman to Batwing.

616
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Batwing. Where are you?

617
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,240
<i>You good?</i>

618
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,360
Across the dome.
My shoulder's jacked.

619
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,960
She can't be far. Stay alert.

620
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
Okay. What's up, Dad?

621
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,280
No comment from the peanut gallery?

622
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,320
I got my ass blown off from my feet,
and you got nothing to say, huh?

623
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,920
Dad? Dad, you there?

624
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,360
What kind of hero
still needs his daddy?

625
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,960
East garden. I found Mary.

626
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,040
- I think.
- Please, you didn't find me.

627
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,000
I found myself, and here I am.

628
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,680
Look, we're gonna find a way
to fix this, Mary.

629
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,720
We're gonna help you.

630
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,240
Everyone keeps saying that.

631
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
They're gonna help me.

632
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,680
Help me, what? Be less happy?

633
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,120
Less myself? Less alive?

634
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,280
This isn't you and you know it.

635
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,760
You're not hearing me, Luke.

636
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,560
This is exactly me.

637
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,440
Just without the part
that does everything you want.

638
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,120
Dad? Dad! Help! Help me!

639
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,240
You dad's gone, Luke.

640
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,680
I took out your failsafe
and the AI that came with it.

641
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,480
I figured Lucius Fox's brain

642
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,720
could really open up
some doors for me in the future.

643
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,280
That's my dad!

644
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,800
You don't need him.

645
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,240
You said it yourself,
you don't have PTSD.

646
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,520
You don't need a team doctor.

647
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,640
And you certainly
don't need your daddy

648
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,400
telling you what you can
and can't do.

649
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,640
Am I right?

650
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,040
Well, well, well.

651
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,280
Finally, I have your full attention.

652
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,720
I've been a crappy friend.

653
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,360
I'm sorry, Mary.

654
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,400
Friend?

655
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,880
You never asked me how I am.

656
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,760
You never give me any of your time.

657
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,880
You give more of yourself to a woman

658
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,440
who literally gave you away

659
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,720
and said she wanted nothing
to do with you

660
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,360
than you do your own teammate.

661
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,880
And that is not friendship.

662
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,400
Okay. Mary, we need to go now.

663
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,520
Look, these cops won't care
who you are

664
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,800
or what happened to you.

665
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,960
They will just lock
your ass up for good.

666
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,840
Mary, come with me.

667
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm done with team spirit.

668
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,800
It's time
you heard my voice for once.

669
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,360
Loud and clear.

670
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,960
Mary!

671
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,560
You've been so wrapped up
in your own drama, Ryan.

672
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,120
Mary.

673
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,080
It's time you got wrapped up in mine
for once.

674
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,680
All right. Don't flinch.

675
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,320
Let me help.

676
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,880
You called the cops?

677
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,240
You knew who we're looking for
all along, didn't you?

678
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,680
Look, you don't understand.
Mary's our best friend.

679
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,000
No, you two don't understand.

680
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,960
Your best friend is currently
the most dangerous person in Gotham.

681
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,880
And you just set her lose
on the city.

682
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,240
You need a hand?

683
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,040
I need a Mary.

684
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,080
I thought...

685
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,440
I could reconnect with my family
and handle bat duties but...

686
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,560
I became oblivious
to what was going on with Mary.

687
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't know what's worse,
that she felt that way

688
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,720
or that we didn't realize it.

689
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,520
She may be infected
with Poison Ivy...

690
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,080
but that anger was all her.

691
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,760
I don't think an apology
is gonna fix this.

692
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,040
Everything she said to me was true.

693
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,120
She tried to tell me
about the incident at the park.

694
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,720
And I was so distracted

695
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,400
with my family drama, I didn't
even give her the time of day.

696
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,080
This is my fault.

697
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
What's the damage?

698
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,120
Torn rotator cuff.

699
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,680
I deserve it.

700
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,560
I didn't take her warning
about the suit seriously.

701
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,160
Okay, well,
we're taking her seriously now.

702
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,200
- Any word from Alice?
- Not yet.

703
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,800
Yeah, I told Sophie to shoot me
a text when she gets home.

704
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,920
In the meantime,
have every Wayne satellite

705
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,640
scanning for her face 24/7
until we find her.

706
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,880
Okay, and then what?

707
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,600
It's an infection, right?

708
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,960
We make a cure.

709
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,520
How do you supposed we do that

710
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,320
without our team scientist?

711
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,440
I call in a favor.

712
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,040
Better make that two.

713
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,560
Bad day?

714
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,760
Not that I ever need a new excuse.

715
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,480
You?

716
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,560
Yup.

717
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,520
Oh, hope I'm not making it worse.

718
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,200
Believe it or not, Montoya...

719
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,360
there are other people I'd rather
not be drinking with right now.

720
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,400
Nicest thing anyone
said to me all day.

721
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,400
Jada? It's Ryan.

722
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,800
I need your help.

723
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,080
Mary, Mary, quite contrary.
How does your garden grow?

724
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
Quite well it seems

725
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,000
from all the sirens
I've been hearing around town.

726
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,320
It's fully electric, Steppy.

727
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,800
Was that supposed to impress me?

728
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,400
Yeah, considering
it was 10 times harder to hotwire.

729
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
So, you going to tell me what you did
to everyone's favorite cellar dweller

730
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,400
from the Mayor's office or what?

731
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,040
On the road.

732
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,440
There's that patented Dr. Hamilton
bedside manner, all warm and chatty.

733
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,760
Get in.
