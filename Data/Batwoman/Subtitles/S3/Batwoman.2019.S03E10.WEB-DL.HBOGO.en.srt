00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,440
<i>Previously on Batwoman.</i>

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,960
Ever since the Joker
pressed that buzzer to your head

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,280
you haven't been the same.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,520
And I need to fix you.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,720
What are you doing?

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,760
Taking initiative.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,400
How about we kill
your two little sidekicks

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,880
at the same time?

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,240
Do you think
we should hook him up to fluids?

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,400
Unless you want him to wake up.

11
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,480
Another jolt would reawaken
his empathy.

12
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,000
But I have spent millions
looking for the buzzer

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,120
but no one's seen it.

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,600
Ten years, and, suddenly,
it's like yesterday.

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,960
What were you thinking would happen
when you freed me?

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,800
I wasn't. I got wrapped up
in the moment seeing you.

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,600
I thought the water would revive me.

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,560
I need to get my strength back.

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Hello?

20
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,280
- Get away from me!
- Whoa, no!

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,960
Oh, little sister.

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,440
What have you done?

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,720
Maybe that'll get you
out of your head.

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,160
<i>You found me.</i>

25
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
<i>No.</i>

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
<i>You found me.</i>

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
What the...

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
What is happening?

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,040
This is so not me.

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,520
You underestimate yourself, Mary.

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,120
Just like your friends always have.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,600
What the hell is going on?

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,520
I need you to...

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Hello.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,280
I'm Dr. Hamilton.

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,880
Do you know who I am?

37
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,520
Of course. Harold Marlowe,
CEO of Gotham United Healthcare.

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,560
We didn't just kidnap a rando.

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,800
This was a focused,
specific abduction...

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,320
Get to the point. Too many words
gets a little mustache-twirly.

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,200
Here's the thing, Harry.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,400
I've treated tons of patients.

43
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,480
Single moms, students, the unhoused.

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,320
You know what they all have
in common?

45
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,800
Please, please.

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,880
They all have claims denied by you.

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Please.

48
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,520
Perhaps if you spent
a little more time in nature

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,280
you might have the chance
to put yourself in their shoes.

50
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,640
Imagine you're the dad of a kid
whose treatment isn't covered

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,520
so you work two extra jobs.

52
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,760
Your kid...

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
gets sicker and sicker.

54
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,960
You get poorer and poorer.

55
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,160
Please, please.

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,600
You lose your home

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,720
you're living in your car

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,680
you're drowning
in a lifetime of debt.

59
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,320
And, suddenly, just having a sick kid

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,600
seems like a day off.

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,960
Damn, that felt good.

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,920
That was epic. Did you rehearse that?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,520
Oh, I've been dealing
with the horrors

64
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,960
of the Gotham healthcare system
for a while now.

65
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,360
But I think that
you just unlocked something.

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,920
- You found your calling, doc.
- I mean, I get it now.

67
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,920
Justice. Using this gift
to level the playing field.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,160
Now, the press
is gonna label you a villain.

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
They're gonna call you unhinged
and use way too many puns.

70
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,920
But if you just do what feels right

71
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
they can't stop you.

72
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Yeah.

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,640
Pam.

74
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,960
Your nose. It's happening again.

75
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,320
I didn't even do the heavy lifting.

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Here.

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,320
I can take it.

78
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Go ahead.

79
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,560
Thank you, Mary.

80
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,720
No problem.

81
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
You okay?

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
I'm fine.

83
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Let's go.

84
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,240
Yeah, hi. We have a problem.

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,280
{\an5}Pamela Isley beckoned Mary
all the way from Metropolis?

86
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,600
{\an5}Why didn't you stop her?

87
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,280
{\an5}Believe me, I tried.

88
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,040
{\an5}Mary mind-roofied me.

89
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,400
And while a deep betrayal
at the time

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,000
if I'm being honest

91
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,960
I haven't slept that well
since I torched Mabel Cartwright.

92
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,560
Hold up. Mary pheromone'd you?

93
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,160
I thought you two were buds?

94
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,600
{\an5}And I thought
you were working out of Renee's

95
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,240
{\an5}but I got to say, I'm loving

96
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,360
{\an5}this whole commuter-coffee shop vibe
you've got going on.

97
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
Why should we trust anything you say?

98
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,000
{\an5}Because I'm in a gay bar
when I'm supposed to be in Santorini.

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,720
So you do the math.

100
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,880
{\an5}Look, we couldn't stop Mary.

101
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,400
{\an5}We got our asses kicked by the OG.

102
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,920
{\an5}So how do you suppose that we stop
two Poison Ivys at the same time?

103
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
{\an5}Easy.

104
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,120
{\an5}You wanna kill a plant,
you take away its sunshine.

105
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,800
Not easy, seeing as though none of us
can actually control the weather.

106
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,040
{\an5}She means Renee.

107
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,720
{\an5}We go after Pam's weakness.

108
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,560
You're gonna wanna get on that today.

109
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,920
ASAP.
Like, ten minutes ago.

110
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,000
{\an5}Your deal with Renee for your freedom
was a scam

111
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,600
{\an5}which means you're a wanted criminal.

112
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,960
You wouldn't risk coming back here

113
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,480
unless there was something deeper
going on.

114
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,600
So, what is it?

115
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Me?

116
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Deep?

117
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,080
There's no need for insults.

118
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Besides

119
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,560
{\an5}we're running out of time.

120
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,280
{\an5}Not gonna lie, what you said
to that insurance sleaze

121
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,720
really hit home.

122
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,360
{\an5}Didn't take you
for a paying-your-premiums type.

123
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,640
{\an5}Well, my little brother
had really bad asthma growing up

124
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
{\an5}and we didn't have a lot of money

125
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,520
{\an5}so our mom got super into plants,
herbal remedies.

126
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,720
{\an5}A few years after my brother got sick

127
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,640
{\an5}we learned that
our drinking water had been poisoned

128
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
{\an5}by the factory up the hill.

129
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,520
{\an5}Doctors said it was a miracle
we weren't all in the hospital.

130
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,840
My brother didn't make it
to his 13th birthday.

131
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,280
I thought Renee said
she'd pick us up at the road.

132
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
She did.

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,160
Hey, I got the tickets.

134
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,760
I'm about 20 minutes away

135
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,320
so pack up,
I'll swing by to grab you.

136
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,120
Where are we packing for?

137
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Miss us?

138
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
{\an5}Apparently not, since she's leaving
without saying goodbye.

139
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,760
{\an5}What is this?

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
{\an5}Oh, this is us
catching you mid-betrayal

141
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,040
{\an5}and reminding you
we have a binding contract, Renee.

142
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,320
You know what that is?

143
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,000
Gotham Dam.

144
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,720
Toured it
on a fourth grade field trip.

145
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,840
Let me guess.

146
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,120
You learned that it supplies power
to over half the industry in Gotham

147
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,280
and saves the city money.

148
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,720
Did they also tell you
that it's responsible

149
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,760
for the extinction
of an entire species of fish?

150
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,920
Dried out riverbeds?
Eroded farmlands?

151
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,440
To be honest,
I wasn't really paying attention.

152
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,800
No one is.

153
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
And then we wake up in 50 years
and our planet is dead

154
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,560
because we killed it.

155
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,920
What are we doing here?

156
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,720
I wanted to show you
my passion project.

157
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,240
This dam feeds
into Gotham's industrial district.

158
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,320
The factory that killed your brother.

159
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
One of them.

160
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,480
But there are dozens more
doing the exact same thing.

161
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,880
Finding loopholes in regulations,
no consequences.

162
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Mary.

163
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,760
I brought you here
because I was hoping

164
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,040
you would help me help Mother Nature

165
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,480
drown Gotham's industry in her tears.

166
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Oh, are those too tight?

167
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,120
I'm not sure what you think
this will accomplish.

168
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,240
Well, for one, you're not getting
on a plane right now.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,440
You're gonna tell us
where your girlfriend took Mary.

170
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,720
Like I said, betraying Pam
was the biggest mistake of my life.

171
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,880
I'm not doing it again.

172
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,120
It wasn't a mistake.

173
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,080
You said it yourself,
you saved hundreds of lives

174
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,880
by putting her away, and you know it.

175
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,400
It was the right move.

176
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,040
Keep me here as long as you want.

177
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm sure the owners of this place
will find it great for business.

178
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,880
They are the owners of this place.

179
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

180
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,280
How did you know we were...

181
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,800
Luke called, thinking I could help.

182
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,680
Is that a problem?

183
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
No.

184
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,960
Okay, now that that's sorted

185
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,000
Soph, dear, can you fix this?

186
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,520
What is Sophie supposed to do?

187
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,200
Like you've never stolen
Sophie's cell phone

188
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,840
and read her private text messages?

189
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,240
- They've been intimate.
- Okay, this is ridiculous.

190
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,400
The only ridiculous part
is us thinking we could trust you.

191
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,000
When were you gonna tell everyone

192
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,760
that you have the joy buzzer
this whole time?

193
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,440
Oh, you really think I was gonna let
a psycho killer loose in the city

194
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,120
I spent my career protecting?

195
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,960
Now, I'm confused.
Are we talking about Alice or Pamela?

196
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,680
Let's cut to the chase.

197
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,640
You are gonna tell us
what Pam did with Mary

198
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,880
or this psycho killer's
gonna show you what she can do

199
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,520
with a lemon zester.

200
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
Trust me, I've done worse with less.

201
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
Hey, Batwoman, heads-up.

202
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,840
Someone just turned on
the Bat signal.

203
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,040
Hey.

204
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,240
Go ahead. Let me talk to Renee.
I know how to think like a cop.

205
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,160
We'll get Mary back.

206
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,440
I gotta go.

207
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,160
You're playing a dangerous game
taking a son from his mother.

208
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,360
I took him to stop the dangerous game
he was playing.

209
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,200
And here I thought
the city found you charming.

210
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,480
Where's the buzzer?

211
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,160
The Joker pressed
this god-forsaken thing

212
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,760
to my son's head
and turned him into a monster.

213
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
I've been told
that another buzz could cure him.

214
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,520
If there's a way
to make it work again, I'll find it.

215
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,840
If you think I'm handing this to you
without getting my son back

216
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,560
you're crazier than he is.

217
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,760
You don't get it.

218
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,760
If he wakes up before we figure out
how to make that thing work

219
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,760
you're the first one he goes after.

220
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,960
I'm safe.

221
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,280
My son and I have an arrangement.

222
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,160
Really?

223
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,280
Well, does that arrangement
trickle down to your employees?

224
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,520
The last time Marquis
was in your custody

225
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,080
it didn't go so well for them.

226
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,360
How do you know anything about that?

227
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,120
Your people talk more
than you'd like.

228
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,720
And here you thought
they all found you charming.

229
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,360
Give me the buzzer.

230
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,360
I'll find a way to make it work.

231
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,800
It's the only choice you have here.

232
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,080
If I give you this

233
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,240
I want my son back in exchange.

234
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Fine.

235
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
By midnight.

236
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,760
Or we have a problem.

237
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,320
Terrifying, isn't it?

238
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,160
It's a small ocean.

239
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,200
That's what happens when
you redirect entire river systems.

240
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,200
What are we doing up here?

241
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,960
I have to unlock
the grates of the turbines

242
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,360
so we can get started.

243
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,640
But you'll flood
more than the industrial district.

244
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,280
You could wipe out half the city.

245
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,440
If I wanted Renee here,
I would have invited her.

246
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm not trying to be a Renee-sayer

247
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,560
but unleashing this much water
on a major metropolitan city

248
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,040
- could kill a lot of people.
- Yes.

249
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,480
And by taking out those polluters,
we'll save so many more.

250
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,200
To say nothing of the environment.

251
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,400
I wanna help you, Pam.

252
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,760
Seriously, I owe you so much.

253
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,600
But I finally figured out what to do
with all of this energy, this power.

254
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,400
And I don't need to be drawing
the kind of heat that comes

255
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,840
with being the girl
who drowned the city.

256
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,760
I get it.

257
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,920
This isn't your fight.

258
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,320
I'm not gonna make you do something
that you don't wanna do.

259
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Thank you.

260
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,440
But I still need your help.

261
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,840
Pam, you're hurting me.

262
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,920
Please.

263
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,960
Let me go.

264
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,000
Thank you, Mary. I mean that.

265
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,960
I could not have done this
without you.

266
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,120
Found her just lying here.
She's alive.

267
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,640
What the hell is she doing up here?

268
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,880
I'll call it in. Go search the place.
See if there's anybody else.

269
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,160
I don't get it, Renee.

270
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,760
I know you're smart
and I know you know what comes next.

271
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,360
Aiding and abetting

272
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,840
obstruction of justice,
stealing evidence.

273
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,960
Need I go on?

274
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,800
I'm curious, though.

275
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,560
If the roles were reversed

276
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,400
would Pamela be sitting here,
risking everything for you right now?

277
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,560
You're right. You think about that.

278
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,680
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

279
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,440
What? 72 hours of this,
and she'll be singing like a canary.

280
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,040
Tell me you're having more luck
with the scanner.

281
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,960
Nothing out of the ordinary.

282
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,480
Hey, what was up with Ryan before?

283
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
When?

284
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,640
You know,
when she was weirdly surprised

285
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,880
that I didn't check in with her
before I invited you down here.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,960
- She didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

287
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Doesn't matter.

288
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,040
Well, arguably,
it matters even more now.

289
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,960
<i>3-6-5 en route with a priority one.
Approximately 25-year-old female.</i>

290
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,080
<i>Unconscious.</i>

291
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,320
<i>We're on Route 99 heading west,
about 18 miles out.</i>

292
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,240
<i>Copy, 3-6-5. We're ready receive.</i>

293
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,240
<i>Not sure if you wanna notify family,
but my partner recognized her</i>

294
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,480
<i>as Commander Jacob Kane's daughter.</i>

295
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
<i>Over.</i>

296
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,600
<i>Not-Batcave to Batwoman.</i>

297
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,040
Jada gave me the buzzer.

298
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,120
And then, in return, she demanded
Marquis back by midnight.

299
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
- Or else...
- Or else what?

300
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,320
Knowing takes all the fun out of it.

301
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,840
But the last time she thought
I screwed her over

302
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,680
she tanked Wayne
and we lost the company.

303
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,000
Okay, as much as I love reminiscing,
Mary was just found unconscious.

304
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,040
- Wait, is she okay?
- <i>That's all I got.</i>

305
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,280
She's en route to Gotham General.

306
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,960
<i>G-Med Ambulance number 3-6-5
traveling west on 99</i>

307
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,520
about 35 minutes away.

308
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,320
If I go after Mary, there's no way
I'll make Jada's deadline.

309
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I agree.

310
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,640
It's a lot easier to pluck her
from an ambulance

311
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,920
than hijacking her from a hospital.

312
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,160
I'll take whatever Jada throws at me.
I'm getting Mary back.

313
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,360
But I'm gonna need help.

314
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,960
Batwoman, I'm here. What do you need?

315
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,920
Tell Alice to stop drinking.

316
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,120
What the hell was that?

317
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,280
What do you expect when you put
the gas next to the brake?

318
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,880
Oh, my God. Pull over.

319
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,640
Relax. I know how to drive.

320
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,560
The damn car's an automatic.

321
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,280
Obviously.
I'm just reviewing my options.

322
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,720
You're not getting my bearings.

323
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,080
No. No options.

324
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,560
Eyes on the road.
Hands on ten and two.

325
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,760
Can I listen to some music, teacher?

326
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,760
If it means we don't have to talk.

327
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,280
<i>How do you think this makes me look
to my friends? I trusted you.</i>

328
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,400
<i>I promise you,
it was nothing personal.</i>

329
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,800
- The music...
- Quiet. This is juicy.

330
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,920
<i>Do you even remember
what you told me that night?</i>

331
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,040
She's talking about the night.

332
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,200
Oh, come on,
like you're not dying to know.

333
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,200
<i>I said a lot of things
that night, Sophie.</i>

334
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,200
<i>Kentucky whiskey does that to a girl.</i>

335
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,520
What? Don't take that, Sophie!

336
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,840
<i>Then, I'll remind you.</i>

337
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,680
<i>You said you saved
a lot of people's lives</i>

338
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,400
<i>by locking Pamela away.</i>

339
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,040
<i>I could tell you meant it.</i>

340
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,880
<i>It's not too late to do it again.</i>

341
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,440
<i>Let's not act like we had
some deep connection, okay?</i>

342
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,880
<i>You couldn't be
with your first choice</i>

343
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
<i>and I was there.</i>

344
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,880
I wonder who her first choice is.

345
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,720
- Oh, well.
- Don't.

346
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,040
<i>My first choice?</i>

347
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,800
<i>You bitched about Ryan all night.</i>

348
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,000
- Hey, that's you.
- Shut up.

349
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,120
<i>And all I know is,
when I'm not into someone</i>

350
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,040
<i>I don't talk about them constantly.</i>

351
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,160
She has a good point.

352
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Whatever.

353
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,560
"Whatever"?

354
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,800
That's a big deal.
Sophie likes you back.

355
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,680
Back?

356
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,400
Who said I liked Sophie?

357
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,440
All the girls on the playground?

358
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,960
Come on, it's obvious.

359
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,120
You're avoiding your feelings
for Sophie

360
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,320
which is why you asked me
to be your wheel woman and not her.

361
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,200
You and I are the same, Batty.

362
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,040
We pretend like we don't care

363
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,600
but it's only because
when we get something good

364
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,200
we know we're gonna screw it up.

365
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,280
You mean, like you and Mary?

366
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,120
What happened between you two?

367
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,760
That's her.

368
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Get closer.

369
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,560
Can't you just get her
with the grapple hook or something?

370
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,040
You want her to come flying
through the rear doors?

371
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,520
So particular.

372
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Pull over!

373
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,880
Oh, my God, Batwoman?

374
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,800
I need the patient.

375
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,160
She needs a hospital.

376
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,640
Speed up.

377
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,480
- Seriously?
- Get in front of him.

378
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,520
Keep straight.

379
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,720
And when I land,
pull over and wait...

380
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,400
Oh, just make your move, bossy pants.

381
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,200
What the hell is going on up there?

382
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,680
We're being jumped by Batwoman.

383
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,120
Stop the car!

384
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,400
I... We can't.

385
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,840
The patient needs medical treatment.

386
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,160
Chester, you need to stop, right now.

387
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,560
Mary, it's Ryan.
Can you feel my hand?

388
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,800
Whoa. Poison Pam really did
a number on her.

389
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,120
Maybe it's for the best.

390
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,560
We risked our lives
trying to get her back.

391
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,080
Well, she's not dead.
She's just in a coma.

392
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,880
And if we're lucky,
she'll stay that way

393
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,760
so we never have to tell her
she killed a man.

394
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,280
What?

395
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,400
Oh, yeah. Mary killed a man.

396
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,680
A hunter. She gutted him
with a tree branch.

397
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,800
It's pretty horrific, actually.

398
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,280
Why didn't you tell me
she killed someone?

399
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,440
Because she doesn't know yet.

400
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,200
She just flung him
and didn't wait to see the damage.

401
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,400
Anyway, I'm guessing
if Poison Ivy Jr.

402
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,600
ever turns back into St. Mary

403
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,880
learning what she did
will pretty much destroy her.

404
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,640
It feels so good
to get that off of my chest.

405
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,560
We need water.

406
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,240
- What happened to her?
- No idea. She's unresponsive.

407
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
Blood in her nose, her ears.

408
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,400
I'm barely getting a pulse.

409
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,560
Mary, can you hear me?

410
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,600
It's called sporeling transference.

411
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm sorry. What now?

412
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,640
Think of Mary
like a supernatural battery pack.

413
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,880
Being desiccated for ten years
took its toll on Pam.

414
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,440
The vine from Batman's trophy case
somehow found Mary

415
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,640
infected her, and turned her
into Pam's sporeling.

416
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,200
Okay, can you stop saying that word?

417
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,920
So Mary was created

418
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,920
so Pam could leech off
her life force?

419
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,320
No. Pam is not a parasite.

420
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,880
She genuinely cares about Mary.

421
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,800
So if Mary's life force
looks like that

422
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,480
can we assume
that Pam is firing on all cylinders?

423
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,760
On all cylinders?

424
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,000
She just went from a minivan
to a space rocket.

425
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,200
So why now?

426
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,080
To finish what she started.

427
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,520
Well, aren't you suddenly a wealth
of valuable information.

428
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,480
How'd you get her to talk?

429
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,800
Kentucky whiskey?

430
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,000
Pam's gonna hit the dam.

431
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,480
That's the only thing
outside the city on Route 99.

432
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,800
That's what Pam was targeting

433
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
before Batman stopped her
ten years ago.

434
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,360
That means she's still there.

435
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
I'm going after her.

436
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,840
Please tell me you're joking.

437
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,240
If Pam is at full strength,
you don't stand a chance.

438
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
None of you do. Not even together.

439
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,680
Batman tried to stop her for months

440
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,880
until he realized
he needed me to set the trap.

441
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,360
So, what do you suggest?

442
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,040
You wanna stop Pam, you need her.

443
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Mary?

444
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
Mary? Can you hear us?

445
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,240
Why am I here?

446
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,400
Workers found you at the dam
and called 911.

447
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,720
We think Pam almost killed you.

448
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,560
Pam? No.

449
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,000
She just needed energy. I'm fine.

450
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,520
She's using you, Mary.

451
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
It's not like that.

452
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,600
I'm fine.

453
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,080
Seriously.

454
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,720
Anyway, this has been real,
but I need to find her.

455
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,360
She's probably wondering
where the hell I am.

456
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,920
She is not your friend, Mary.

457
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,080
She created you
because she needs you to survive.

458
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,280
Of course, you'd say that.

459
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
I finally find somebody who values me

460
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,480
so I must be in a toxic,
codependent relationship.

461
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,920
It can't possibly be
that this is actually who I am

462
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and that people like me?

463
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,960
You're a portable battery, Mary.

464
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,520
And you're all out of charge.

465
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,720
So listen to a Kelly Clarkson song
and move on.

466
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,320
What are you doing here?

467
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,880
Who do you think told us about Pam?

468
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
You know...

469
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,920
guess you were right.

470
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,080
Guess I am the crazy one.

471
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,360
Says the Arkham inmate
still pretending

472
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,840
she's stuck
in a children's fairy tale.

473
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,520
A grown woman
dressed like a flying rodent.

474
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,920
- Okay, you made your point.
- You know what?

475
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,160
Don't even get me started
on Daddy's Little Robocop

476
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,480
or the Queen of Unemployment.

477
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
I didn't even say anything.

478
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, but you're here, aren't you?

479
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,400
A part of this friend-tervention
or whatever this is.

480
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,000
But if you were all
actually my friends

481
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,680
then you'd respect my wish
when I said to leave me alone!

482
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,200
You killed someone, Mary.

483
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,520
A hunter.

484
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,560
An innocent man.

485
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
You didn't realize it.

486
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,080
You thought you just flung him
out of your way, but you didn't.

487
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,280
He's dead.

488
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,680
I think I'd know if I killed someone.

489
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,800
You're wrong.

490
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,040
You wanna stop Poison Ivy
from destroying this city?

491
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,080
There isn't much time left.

492
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,000
What the actual hell?

493
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,360
Hey, lady, you can't be down here.

494
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,440
You're gonna kill yourself.

495
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,920
You're here.

496
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,600
What happened to him?

497
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,480
He wanted to stop me.

498
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,000
I thought you were sitting this out.

499
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,280
I didn't see you on the bridgeway.

500
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,880
I realized that as much as I don't
wanna take any innocent lives

501
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,360
I didn't wanna put you in danger

502
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,200
of exerting yourself
past the point of no return.

503
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,120
And after everything
you've done for me

504
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,840
I owe you so much.

505
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,760
Want a boost?

506
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,120
Desperately.

507
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,440
<i>Mary is the only one she trusts</i>

508
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,760
<i>so Mary's the only one
who can pull this off.</i>

509
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,320
A few years ago, I developed
what I hoped was a pheromone-blocker.

510
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,880
Every morning,
I put a few drops in my coffee.

511
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,040
Did this for years.

512
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,440
Partly out of habit, partly because
I've always hoped to see Pam again.

513
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,880
What, I can't be sentimental?

514
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,400
The other day,
I found out firsthand it works.

515
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,280
The chemical agents blocked
Pam's ability to mind-control me.

516
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,200
Meaning, it must've weakened her
substantially.

517
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,360
So, what do we do with it?

518
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,720
If Mary drinks it
and Pam draws her energy

519
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,160
it could weaken her,
enough for you to get the upper hand.

520
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,520
<i>Mary's the Trojan horse.</i>

521
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,600
<i>Pam never sees it coming.</i>

522
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,320
If Pam was weakened substantially,
doesn't that mean

523
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,880
- that Mary will be too?
- Likely.

524
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,000
But between her biological reactions
to the blocker

525
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,320
and Pam draining whatever
Poison Ivy energy she has left

526
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,680
it could be the best shot
you all have

527
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,320
at everything being pulled out

528
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
and getting Mary back for good.

529
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,600
<i>And when you say drain her energy,
how much are we talking?</i>

530
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,200
<i>If I had to guess, every last drop.</i>

531
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,000
No. It could kill her.
We're not doing that.

532
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,560
We need to.

533
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,960
It's the only way to stop her.

534
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,880
And if she drains you to death?

535
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,000
I won't let her.

536
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,200
I'll pull away.

537
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,360
You can do that?

538
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,720
You can pull out of her grip
while she's draining you?

539
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,880
Pam's not stronger than me.

540
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,840
What's happening?

541
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,640
Mary, what...

542
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,400
what did you do?

543
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,360
She stopped herself
from becoming you.

544
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,680
I gotta go.
I'll check in when we get there.

545
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,800
I need to come with you.

546
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,600
Thought without your AI,
Batwing was on the sidelines

547
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,120
until you find a way
to deal with, you know...

548
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,520
My head. I know.

549
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,920
But you can't take down Poison Ivy

550
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,680
and also stop a dam
from imploding at once.

551
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,000
- Look, you don't have to do this.
- Yeah, I need to.

552
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
For me.

553
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,840
There is a whole mess of people
out there

554
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,360
willing to believe
that you deserved it

555
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,480
just because you're Black.

556
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,040
I don't wanna live in that world.

557
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,320
I wanna be with my dad.

558
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,680
Don't lie to yourself.

559
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,280
You wouldn't beat me
with two good hands.

560
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,880
There's no voice.

561
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,360
There's no voice...

562
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,840
but my voice.

563
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,160
Come on, Luke.

564
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,000
Come on, Luke.

565
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,400
The city can't be saved, Batwoman.

566
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,680
It's a cesspool of crime,
filth, and pollution.

567
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,720
Let it go. Start fresh!

568
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Damn!

569
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
You gotta teach me that.

570
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,280
Did you stop it?

571
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,080
Yeah. The dam's stable.

572
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,400
It's done.

573
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,800
And so is Pamela.

574
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,080
Mary.

575
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,440
Is she breathing?

576
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,400
- Barely.
- Let's take her home.

577
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,760
The city is worth saving.

578
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,920
At least it is to me.

579
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,960
I'm back.

580
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,800
I can feel it.

581
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,160
I'm me again.

582
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,080
Welcome back, Mary.

583
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Never thought I'd miss
those brown eyes so much.

584
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,160
And we owe you a giant apology.

585
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,480
Mary, we will never let you
feel sidelined by this team

586
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,760
ever again, okay?

587
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
We're family.

588
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Guys

589
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,800
I really appreciate the warm welcome

590
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
but...

591
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,800
I remember everything.

592
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,600
I know what happened.

593
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,560
I killed someone.

594
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,000
Poison Ivy killed someone.

595
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,000
And now, she's gone.

596
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,920
And Mary's back.

597
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah.

598
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,200
You came back to Gotham
because you care about her.

599
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,960
I'm sorry, who are we talking about?

600
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Mary.

601
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,480
Because even though a part of you
loved every second of it

602
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,520
you still feel guilty
for changing her to be more like you.

603
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,360
Alice the Benevolent
does have a nice ring to it.

604
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,240
So I suppose this means
that you'll step in

605
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,400
and make a deal with the mayor
for my freedom.

606
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
No.

607
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,160
You're on your own.

608
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Fine.

609
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,360
Suppose it wouldn't mean much
coming from a pumpkin anyway.

610
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
What?

611
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,000
Well, you missed
Mommy's 12.00 deadline

612
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,920
and I, for one, can't wait to see

613
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,200
what Jada has in store
for the Bat Team this time.

614
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,800
You're okay.

615
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,160
You're on a plane.

616
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,200
You did this?

617
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,480
Again?

618
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,320
My God.

619
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,200
How stupid am I?

620
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,120
Of course, you did this to me.

621
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,520
You sold me out.

622
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
Where are we even going?

623
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,000
- Can I please explain?
- No.

624
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,800
No more explaining.

625
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,320
We have explained each other
to death.

626
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,600
We shouldn't be together.

627
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,960
Well, this doesn't work.

628
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,160
We want two different things. You...

629
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,720
I'm not having this fight again.

630
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,880
Then, don't.

631
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,720
If going back and destroying
everything and everyone

632
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,400
is more important than me and us...

633
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,120
then go!

634
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,360
What the hell
am I supposed to do, jump?

635
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,040
Why? Is that crazier
than anything you've done before?

636
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
I'll 100 percent die.

637
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,400
Then, stay.

638
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,080
I didn't sell you out, Pam.

639
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,760
I negotiated a deal for your freedom.

640
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
No running, no rules.

641
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,080
But it means
doing things my way for once.

642
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,880
So, what's it gonna be?

643
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,520
Close the damn door.

644
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,560
Where are we going?

645
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,080
Sophie Moore told me
about an off-the-grid island

646
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,520
where plants are worshiped
and industry doesn't exist.

647
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,000
Sounds like a fantasy.

648
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,120
Close.

649
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,160
It's called Coryana.

650
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,720
I don't wanna know.

651
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,560
Hey, any word from Jada?

652
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,520
Luke is still working on the buzzer,
and she's not picking up her phone.

653
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,640
Okay. Well, let me know
if there's anything I can do.

654
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Hey.

655
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Thank you.

656
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,880
For whatever you said
that got Renee to talk.

657
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,400
Well, she's not a bad person.
She's just...

658
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
In love?

659
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,160
That's putting it sanely.

660
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,480
It didn't work.

661
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,400
What do you mean?
Pam's finally out of our lives.

662
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Kissing me.

663
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,880
You said it would get me
out of my head, but...

664
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,560
it just got me in it more.

665
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,840
I'm sorry
if you're going through that.

666
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
No, you're not.

667
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,120
Hey.

668
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,200
We got a problem.

669
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,240
<i>In a Channel 8 News exclusive.</i>

670
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,280
<i>Could that woman be responsible
for the throwback blowback?</i>

671
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,040

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,760

<i>by flashback felons from Gotham past.</i>

675
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,720
Whoa, what is this?

676
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,240
I guess Jada's not one
to be kept waiting.

677
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,240
You're telling us The Mad Hatter,
Killer Croc, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy

678
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,360
they're all a result
of a major catastrophe

679
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,360
at the hands of Batwoman?

680
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,840
Batman kept his enemies' weapons
under lock and key.

681
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,960
Batwoman let them out of her sight

682
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,080
and into the hands
of would-be killers.

683
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,320
She's gonna turn the whole city
against me.

684
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,880
<i>Just this morning, it was reported</i>

685
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,200
<i>that Batwoman stopped Poison Ivy
from rupturing the Gotham Dam.</i>

686
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,800
<i>You're missing my point.</i>

687
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,720
<i>Why was Poison Ivy at the dam
in the first place?</i>

688
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,920
<i>Didn't Batman throw her away
a decade ago?</i>

689
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,240
<i>And, yes, she stopped it
from total collapse.</i>

690
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,240
<i>But the dam still broke.</i>

691
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,360
<i>There have been reports of flooding
all over Gotham.</i>

692
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,120
<i>It's time to face this city,
Batwoman.</i>

693
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,800
<i>Admit what you've done.</i>

694
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,400
Turn yourself in
before you do any more damage.
