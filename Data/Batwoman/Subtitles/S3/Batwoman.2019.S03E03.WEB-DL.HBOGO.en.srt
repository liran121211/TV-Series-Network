1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,680
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,000
You're responsible
for everything she does.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,880
Until you two have tracked down
every last one of those toxic toys

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,480
from Batman's trophy case.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,960
Right now, a thousand nanobots

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,040
are swimming
through your bloodstream.

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,800
Sending out tracking beacons
to satellites as we speak.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,320
If I'm reading this right,
the suit thought you were injured.

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,000
Which prompted
a system-wide shutdown

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,480
putting the suit in safe mode.

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,760
I thought you and I agreed

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,080
you'd stay out of my business.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,560
This is personal.

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,720
Because I'm your daughter.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,600
Bus driver! Wait!

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,040
Bus driver, wait...

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,320
Wait, you piece of...

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,960
I pay taxes.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,400
I pay your salary, man!

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,520
Screw you!

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,520
Yo. Wanna see something awesome?

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
Taylor, check this out.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,880
T, look. I found it catching frogs
under Loeb Bridge.

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm about to unlock a pet.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,960
- Taylor, come on.
- Evan, chill.

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,640
Tell them I'm gonna be late.

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,200
I'm sorry. It's not my...

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,800
You gotta be kidding me.

29
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,920
I love this fricking town.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,400
Gotham officials have no comment

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,680
on how a tank of liquid nitrogen

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,840
ended up
in the hands of schoolchildren

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,000
{\an5}and caused this bus to freeze.

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
{\an5}<i>Gotham officials</i>

35
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,560
<i>are linking the freezing agent</i>

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,520
<i>to Mr. Victor Fries</i>

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,320
<i>the deceased cryobiologist</i>

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,440
<i>Gotham remembers

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,400
Ms. Wilder is here for your meeting,
Ms. Jet.

40
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,680
{\an5}<i>Officials are asking
anyone with information</i>

41
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,800
<i>as to where the freeze serum
came from</i>

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,600
<i>to call the GCPD.</i>

43
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,560
That's why I take the subway.

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,040
{\an5}I'm sorry we didn't get a chance

45
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,000
{\an5}to finish our conversation
last night.

46
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,280
I have to admit...

47
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,400
{\an5}I never planned on meeting you.

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,640
It's a lot to process.

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,800
{\an5}I see you've risen
above your circumstances

50
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
{\an5}to get your degree.

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,920
{\an5}Climb the corporate ladder,
become the acting CEO of Wayne.

52
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
You've turned yourself

53
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,520
into a rather remarkable
young woman, Ryan.

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,320
Thank you.

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,360
Look...

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,320
{\an5}I didn't come here
to blame you for anything.

57
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
{\an5}You know, whatever your situation was
at the time

58
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
{\an5}if you were young or scared

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,280
{\an5}or if I was unplanned,
unwanted, whatever.

60
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,680
{\an5}No judgment.

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,680
{\an5}I just wanted you to know
that it's all good.

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,600
I turned out okay.

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,120
{\an5}Ryan, in an effort to respect
your time and mine

64
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,960
{\an5}I will try to make this
as simple as possible.

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,760
{\an5}I'm not interested
in having a relationship

66
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,160
with you.

67
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,960
Now, if you don't mind

68
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,760
I have a meeting
I need to prepare for.

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,160
{\an5}Wait... Why have me
and then cover it up?

70
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,960
Adam, will you let Bonnie know
that I'm on my way?

71
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,760
You paid a doctor two million dollars

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,160
{\an5}to fake your name
on my birth certificate

73
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,600
{\an5}and then made it look like you died

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
so I never came looking for you.

75
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,360
What were you afraid of?

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,880
{\an5}Sometimes, it's better
to stop asking questions.

77
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,880
{\an5}So you invited me here
just to show me the door?

78
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,640
If you continue to try to have
anything to do with my family

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,760
I will personally see to it

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,160
that you and Wayne Enterprises

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,360
will come to severely regret
that decision.

82
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,440
{\an5}I always wondered
who my birth mother was.

83
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,240
Now I know.

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,480
{\an5}Someone not worth my time.

85
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,520
I'm glad we're on the same page.

86
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,840
I missed it? Damn.

87
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,640
{\an5}See, this is what I get
for second-guessing my kicks.

88
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,120
I went deep vault for you, Wilder.

89
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Worth it?

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,280
I actually used to have those
in blue.

91
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,280
There you go. Worth it.

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
See, we're connecting already.

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,800
{\an5}Marquis,
I thought you were on your way

94
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,200
{\an5}to <i>Metropolis Magazine's</i>
influencer party tonight?

95
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
I was, then I heard
you were sitting down

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,080
with a new young CEO without me

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,040
and I figured
there was a scheduling oversight

98
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,600
so I bounced.

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,400
{\an5}I'm sorry. Who are you?

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,920
You're new new.

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
{\an5}That's cool.
I won't take any offense.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
I'm Jeturian Industries'
executive vice president.

103
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
Marquis Jet.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,200
Also known as my son.

105
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,760
You were very clear about
knowing the absolute minimum.

106
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,880
You weren't even sure
if you wanted to get to know Jada.

107
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,680
So knowing she had another kid,
it would've just complicated it more.

108
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,360
A kid she kept
while she gave me away.

109
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,080
Was he cool at least?

110
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,240
I have no idea.

111
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,240
Jada kicked me out of there so fast

112
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,400
I didn't even to get
my parking validated.

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,320
This is exactly why I wanted
to keep that door closed.

114
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,320
- So what now?
- You didn't hear?

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,800
Mr. Freeze's liquid nitrogen can

116
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,200
got in the hands
of a bunch of eighth graders.

117
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,600
I need to find it.

118
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,280
I mean, about your mom.

119
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,680
What can I do?

120
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,000
What do you need?

121
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,440
<i>You poor thing.</i>

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
Thanks.

124
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,640
It sucks, but I'll be fine.

125
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,360
Okay, first, how dare she.

126
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,320
And second, how did you even know
she was still alive?

127
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,200
Okay, everyone was like

128
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,880
"Boo-hoo,
evil Alice killed Ryan's mom."

129
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,040
As if it wasn't bad enough.

130
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,400
And now against all odds

131
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,480
I miraculously provide her
with another one

132
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,360
and you guys
are just bitching and moaning...

133
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,040
Can I get some water?
Please, someone.

134
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,240
Okay, please tell me you have
some info on this freeze stuff.

135
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
So the canister itself is a compact.

136
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,800
It's custom-built vacuum flask

137
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,640
that makes its contents,
aka the freeze stuff

138
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
more concentrated

139
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,000
and seemingly less dangerous
than it is.

140
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Little goes a long way.

141
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,920
So the kid likely found it
near the Gotham River

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,720
and thought
it was a harmless dry-ice gun.

143
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
All right,
I'm really not feeling well.

144
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,360
I think it's all these
tracking nanobots inside me.

145
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,560
My skin, it...

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,320
feels like spiders
are running through my veins.

147
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,040
Okay, that's not a thing.

148
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,800
Wayne Tech uses nanobot injectables
in their research all the time.

149
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Are you calling in sick?
Is that what this is?

150
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,160
Montoya wants us to work together.

151
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,200
My team gets a beat
on a Batman trophy

152
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,880
and then you use
your creepy-ass brain

153
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,160
to help us figure out where it is.

154
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,360
And I would love nothing more, truly

155
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,680
than to talk about
an errant can of liquid nitrogen

156
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,160
but I am finding it very difficult
to focus through my pain.

157
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,400
And I would hate
Ms. Montoya to think

158
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,000
that our little arrangement
didn't work

159
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,560
on account of me
being in a hostile work environment.

160
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,960
Oh, my goodness.

161
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,760
What did I do to deserve this?

162
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,760
You know, it's probably
not the worst thing

163
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,240
if we give Alice the sick day.

164
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,480
Why does she get a day off?

165
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,000
Because I know where the canister is.

166
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,520
Plus, I doubt that you want
one of Gotham's Most Wanted with you

167
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,040
breaking into the GCPD.

168
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,000
- I'm in.
- Cool.

169
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,680
I can only keep the cameras dark
for five minutes, so start looking.

170
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,880
You sure it's here?

171
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,200
Logs say it was tagged and filed
at 10.07am this morning.

172
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,320
<i>No record of anyone removing it.</i>

173
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,720
I think I know why Batman kept
his own evidence locker.

174
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,800
What is this?

175
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,800
What did you do?

176
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,640
I found it, Nora.

177
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,680
We can finally finish
what Victor started.

178
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,000
You stole Victor's freeze tank?

179
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
Nora Fries.

180
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,800
You are gonna tell me

181
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,520
how you were frozen for 20 years...

182
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,080
and lived to talk about it.

183
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,560
I was able to compare
entry and exit footage

184
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
from the time of the theft

185
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,920
and track down who broke
into the evidence room first.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
Are you sure about that?

187
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Dee works
at the GCPD processing desk.

188
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
She's one of the few people

189
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,400
who has access to the evidence room's
secure back area.

190
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,880
Dee also called in sick today

191
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,840
and this lady has never
called in sick once in 20 years.

192
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,320
Okay, but...

193
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,560
All the items in the evidence room?

194
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,440
There has to be something
easier to fence.

195
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,600
Which is what I thought.

196
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
Why would anyone risk everything
for this stuff

197
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,160
apart from the guy who invented it?

198
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,960
Wait, you mean the Mr. Freeze dude?

199
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
- I thought he was dead.
- Victor Fries. He is.

200
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,000
Brilliant cryobiologist.

201
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,280
Half a dozen doctorates.

202
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,840
Still insisted on being called
Mr. Freeze.

203
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,240
But then again, Captain Cold
wasn't really a captain, so...

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Who's that?

205
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Yes.

206
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
That is Nora Fries

207
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,120
{\an5}in an Arkham intake photo
taken three years ago.

208
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,840
So Nora was diagnosed
with the MacGregor's syndrome

209
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,640
a progressive lung disease
that at the time of her diagnosis

210
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
had no cure.

211
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,200
So Victor created
a unique liquid nitrogen formula

212
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,520
to supply a cryochamber
that kept her in stasis

213
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,000
until a cure could be found.

214
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,720
And he died before it happened.

215
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Well, eventually

216
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,360
her cryochamber ran out of Victor's
liquid nitrogen cocktail.

217
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
So when she thawed

218
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,200
Nora learned that doctors found
a cure for MacGregor's.

219
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,360
So they administered it

220
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,920
but she was so disoriented
by the 20-year-time gap

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,880
that officials sent her to Arkham.

222
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,560
She escaped in a breakout
three years ago

223
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,040
and has been MIA ever since.

224
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,440
So what's the connection?

225
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,160
Dee Smithy is Nora Fries's sister.

226
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,240
Send me the address.
I'll fire up the Batmobile.

227
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Okay.

228
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Who's bouncing a basketball

229
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,240
off of Bruce Wayne's shelf
of first editions?

230
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,920
That would be my brother.

231
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
Girl's got reflexes. You play?

232
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,200
Yeah, in all my spare time.

233
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,640
What are you doing here?

234
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
You free for a drink later?

235
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,720
Jada didn't tell you about me.

236
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
Tell me what, Wilder?

237
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,080
She made it very clear

238
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,040
she wanted nothing to do
with Wayne Enterprises

239
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
and that
l have nothing to do with her.

240
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,520
You ruffled some feathers.
What did you do?

241
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,960
Because normally,
she eats the rags-to-riches stuff up.

242
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,920
Reminds her of herself.

243
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,120
So you think you know my story.

244
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,360
Twenty-seven.

245
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,040
Raised in the system,
stint at Blackgate

246
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,000
and now acting CEO of Wayne.

247
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,040
Oh, and you're my sister.

248
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
She told you that?

249
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,960
She didn't have to.

250
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
How did you figure this out?

251
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,960
Oh, nannies talk.

252
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,960
Like mine did when moms disappeared
for nine months straight.

253
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,320
Heard about it as a kid years later

254
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,040
while her and my old man didn't speak
for a full summer after that.

255
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,160
So it was an affair.

256
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,560
Then we fast forward 27 years.

257
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,520
Here's some bad-ass chick
one year younger than me.

258
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
Shows up at the company,
throws my mom off her game

259
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
and has got her scheduling
all these secret meetings

260
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,520
while I'm supposed to be out of town.

261
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,680
Here you are.
The sister I never knew I had.

262
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,720
I would ask for a hug

263
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,120
but you look like
you could kick my ass, so...

264
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,320
Pretty sure
your mom might beat me to it.

265
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,960
Our mom.

266
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,080
I don't think you should be here.

267
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,000
But I already picked out my office
next to yours.

268
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
What are you talking about?

269
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,400
Because it's the corner.

270
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,800
Way better view, I mean...

271
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,400
I don't even know
why you're in this place.

272
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,680
It's so limited.

273
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,080
You wanna partner
with Wayne Enterprises?

274
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,360
Mom thinks that I'm in this

275
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,320
just for the PJs
and free concert tickets.

276
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,280
Which would mean
I'd be an honorary VP

277
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,440
until she's dead in her Loubies.

278
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,000
Unless I make my mark.

279
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,800
Show what I can do.

280
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,600
Same with you.

281
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,200
Why don't you show her what
she missed out on the last 30 years?

282
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,640
What do you say, sis?

283
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,480
Wanna join forces?

284
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,320
Show her what we got?

285
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,960
You said you'd think about it?

286
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,640
<i>I couldn't exactly ask him
to wait in the lobby</i>

287
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,120
<i>while I followed the 20
on a missing freeze tank.</i>

288
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
What's exactly is there
to think about?

289
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,520
What it might be like
to actually have a brother.

290
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,200
<i>Okay, I get that.</i>

291
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,760
But Jada Jet didn't earn her spot
on the Forbes 150

292
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,240
by making idle threats.

293
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,920
She literally promised to destroy
Wayne Enterprises.

294
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,800
<i>Okay, okay. I'm in Dee's house.</i>

295
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
We're late to the party.
Someone was here, and it got ugly.

296
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,200
- No sign of Dee or the freeze tank.
- What?

297
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,360
Or the roommate we didn't know about.

298
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,400
I think Nora's living here.

299
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,120
But I thought you said they found
the cure for MacGregor's syndrome.

300
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
They did.

301
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,960
According to Nora's medical records,
she received it years ago.

302
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,240
Okay, well, from the looks of it,
she's still sick.

303
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,600
<i>Maybe it didn't take?</i>

304
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,320
Maybe Dee wanted to put Nora
back in her cryochamber

305
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,640
to save her sister's life.

306
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,360
So who broke into the house?

307
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,920
<i>Someone after the same thing?</i>

308
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,080
I don't suppose you know
where one would find a cryochamber.

309
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,760
What do you know about Ace
Chemicals?

310
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,800
Only that no good thing
ever happened there.

311
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,440
And I'm sending you the address now.

312
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,440
Here. Everything you need to know
about cryogenics.

313
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,920
My brother-in-law
kept meticulous notes.

314
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
What's your problem?

315
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
Just learned
my sister was gonna put me on ice

316
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,680
and now I got a gun on my bad hip.

317
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,720
What do you think I'm gonna do, run?

318
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,920
These are the musings of a madman.
I can't read this.

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,520
You gotta show me how it works.

320
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,400
How on earth would we know
the first thing about that?

321
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,080
They didn't even offer science
to women when I was at university...

322
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,000
Show me or she dies.

323
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,920
BP and heart rate are totally normal.

324
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,480
98.6.

325
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,480
Glucose levels
are as average as they come.

326
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,840
Which are all common symptoms
of faking it.

327
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,400
You know, with care like this

328
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
it's amazing
you managed to save any lives.

329
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,520
There's nothing wrong with you,
Alice.

330
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
At least not physically.

331
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,480
I'm sorry.

332
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,160
I think my dangerously high fever

333
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,960
is interfering
with whatever you are hinting at.

334
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,920
The postcards from Dad?

335
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,680
You know, it's funny,
I was actually kind of jealous of you

336
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,000
when I thought that
he was writing to you and not to me.

337
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,240
And then when I found out

338
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,400
that it was just
you being totally delusional

339
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
it honestly was a relief.

340
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Oh, I'm so glad my madness
has soothed your daddy issues.

341
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,200
Does what happen a lot?
Those delusions?

342
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,520
Just the once.

343
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,400
So this whole performative
"I'm sick" thing

344
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,280
isn't, I don't know,
a cry for help, maybe?

345
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,920
I learned a long time ago
that cries for help don't work.

346
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Look...

347
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,920
I'm an official doctor now

348
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,720
so if you need actual help,
I have to give it to you.

349
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,200
So do you?

350
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,080
I see what's going on here.

351
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
You couldn't help Bat Boy

352
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,880
so now you're burdening me
with your savior complex.

353
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,160
Bat Boy?

354
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,840
Yeah. Luke.

355
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,200
It says in his files he's having
some unfortunate performance issues.

356
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,600
You went through my files?
Okay, that cabinet is locked.

357
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,720
I broke out of the Crows
with a fishing line.

358
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,120
Your Office Warehouse cabinet
didn't stand a chance.

359
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,280
Anyway, it's your fault
for taking forever to see me

360
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,080
and not giving me any magazines.

361
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,640
I assume that Batwoman knows

362
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,520
she's working
with an emotional ticking time bomb?

363
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,800
Batwoman doesn't break
into my file cabinet

364
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,280
because it's called
doctor-patient confidentiality.

365
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,440
Perfect. I'm not a doctor.
So what's the issue?

366
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,200
Now you're in the middle.

367
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400
Oh, that's a dilemma.

368
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,600
Do you tell bossy pants Batwoman

369
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,640
that Luke's ignoring
his PTSD symptoms

370
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:22,520
or do you keep Luke's secret
because you love him?

371
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,640
I do not love Luke like that.

372
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,360
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

373
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Sure.

374
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,120
But a little piece of advice.

375
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,920
And keep that to yourself.

376
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,120
Telling Ryan
will only fill you with resentment.

377
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
How do you figure?

378
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,560
Because she'll ignore you, Mary.

379
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
I'm sorry.

380
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,480
Do you not see your place
on this team?

381
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,280
I've been on it for less than a month

382
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,200
and it's already glaringly obvious

383
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,400
they don't see you
unless they need you.

384
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,600
Just like Daddy and just like Kate.

385
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,880
So if you want to go on liking them

386
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,320
it's probably best
to know your place.

387
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Watch your six.

388
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,200
Got a read on some major firepower
in the south parking lot.

389
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,040
- I got eyes on three more inside.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

390
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,440
<i>Be careful, Batwoman.</i>

391
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,240
This is going to make my client
very happy.

392
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,920
- Until he realizes it doesn't work.
- Can it, Nor.

393
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,600
You think we're walking out of here?

394
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,840
We've seen their faces.

395
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,320
What do you mean it doesn't work?

396
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,200
It works fine.

397
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,480
Just a little dust,
a few disinfectant wipes...

398
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,280
The chamber works.

399
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
It'll freeze you solid

400
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,520
but you'd die of hypothermia
eventually.

401
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,720
Well, then what's the point
of this stuff?

402
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Constant exposure to the freeze serum

403
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,120
will stop time
and keep you from aging.

404
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,000
Coming out of it
is a whole other story.

405
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,800
Look, my husband was brilliant.

406
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
But he didn't realize

407
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,880
that once I was released
from the chamber and thawed

408
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,400
time would catch up.

409
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,160
Three years ago, I came out
of that thing a 34-year-old.

410
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,640
And look at me now.

411
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,600
At this rate,
I'll be 122 by Christmas.

412
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
But your sister was about
to lock you back inside of it.

413
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,960
The only way
to stop my sister from dying

414
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,760
is to put her back on ice

415
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,880
till I can find a way
to slow the aging.

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
That's some dedication.

417
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,040
Well, if what she's saying is true,
this is going to be a major problem.

418
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,040
Add me to that list.

419
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,040
Get her out of here.

420
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,920
- Can you walk?
- Better than her.

421
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
Okay. There's a clinic
on Rucka and Bennett.

422
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,000
It's not far.

423
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,160
They'll take care of you.

424
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,520
- I can't leave Dee.
- I'll find her.

425
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,920
A gun? Could you be more basic?

426
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,520
Come on. Let's do this.

427
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Come on!

428
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,640
All right,
let's see this thing in action.

429
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,840
My client wants to know how it works
without wasting product.

430
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,120
But that's the whole point
of Victor's liquid nitrogen.

431
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,680
The formula is what keeps her alive.

432
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,840
Turning on the machine without it
will just blast her with cold air.

433
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,520
She'll die from hypothermia.

434
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,400
Does it look like I care?

435
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,080
I'm not killing Batwoman.

436
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,960
How long do you think it's gonna take

437
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,920
for my driver to find your sister
just hobbling down Rucka Street

438
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,320
and make her roadkill?

439
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,720
Turn it on or your sister dies.

440
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,920
If Batwoman doesn't die...

441
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
you do.

442
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,560
Take her to the car.

443
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,480
Batwoman to Batcave.

444
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,440
Gonna need a little help.

445
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,960
Whoa, talk to me. What is happening?

446
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,080
They trapped me in the cryochamber.

447
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,000
- What?
- Get me the hell out of here.

448
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,840
I'm calling up your biometrics.

449
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,160
Your core body temperature's
dropping like crazy.

450
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,600
Yeah, I'm pretty aware of that.
Okay...

451
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,280
Access the suit's temp regulator.

452
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Yeah.

453
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Oh, boy.

454
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,520
Seriously?
You couldn't keep that to yourself?

455
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,160
The regulator must've frozen up.

456
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,400
You have ten minutes
before a full-blown hypothermia.

457
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,000
You need to stay awake, okay?

458
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,720
Luke...

459
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,800
You need to suit up.

460
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,800
Help Dee.

461
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,880
They took her somewhere.

462
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,040
What? No!
I gotta keep you from passing out.

463
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,440
I am okay.

464
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Go find her.

465
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,920
- If you pass out, it's over, Ryan.
- <i>I won't.</i>

466
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Okay?

467
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,480
Go find her.

468
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,760
I promised...

469
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,880
I promised Nora
I would protect her sister.

470
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Please don't let me die a liar.

471
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,280
Any word from Dee?

472
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,560
Batwoman's on it.

473
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,080
She won't let anything happen
to your sister.

474
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,360
Have you considered cataract surgery?

475
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
That'd be a bit like

476
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,880
cleaning the windows
on the Hindenburg.

477
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,320
Dr. Hamilton,
I was 34 for two decades.

478
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,160
I got out
and started aging double time.

479
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,600
Life's catching up to me.

480
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,320
Why stand in the way?

481
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,920
I thought that's what you wanted.

482
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,200
To literally
stand in the way of time.

483
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,840
I have an idea.

484
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,240
Let's talk about what I want.

485
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,800
What the hell are you doing?

486
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,360
Get these nanobots out of me now!

487
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,840
You know I can't do that.

488
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,120
Because that's the only thing

489
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,640
preventing you
from escaping Gotham entirely.

490
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,760
I wonder why I want them gone.
Get them out!

491
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,360
- Batwoman would kill me.
- And I will kill Nora.

492
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,280
Do you not understand
cause and effect?

493
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,400
- How do you have an MD?
- Let her.

494
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
- What?
- What?

495
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,880
I am so sick of people
sacrificing their lives for me.

496
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,440
My husband, my sister.

497
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,520
The research, the lost years,
the desperation.

498
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
For what?

499
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,560
So I can be trapped all over again?

500
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,440
So you want me to kill you?

501
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Could you be a worse hostage?

502
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
What is wrong with you?

503
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,440
I literally just let her go.

504
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,480
I was being nice to you.

505
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,520
Nice?

506
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,240
You think I want nice?

507
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
You think I want

508
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,200
this stupid arrangement with Batwoman
who I can't even stand

509
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,760
and Little Miss Judgie Two Shoes
being nice?

510
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,880
It's no wonder
I'm losing my freaking mind.

511
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,680
I am so sorry about that.

512
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,280
Believe it or not, she is my sister.

513
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,400
You certainly fight like it.

514
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,200
But I gotta say, I understand her.

515
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,320
You understand the woman
who just had you at knifepoint?

516
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,600
I follow the news.

517
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,760
She's been trapped her whole life.

518
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,040
And now she wants her freedom.

519
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,600
Does your sister know that
that's what you want?

520
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,880
Dee's wasted too many years
of her life trying to fix me.

521
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,240
I love her too much
to tell her the truth.

522
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,080
<i>Batcave to Batwoman.</i>

523
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,520
<i>Batcave to Batwoman.</i>

524
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,640
Sophie?

525
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,720
Batwing's en route. Are you good?

526
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,320
I'm fading.

527
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,080
I just wanna sleep.

528
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,080
Yeah, that's the hypothermia talking.

529
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,840
You know, it's awfully convincing.

530
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,520
<i>Yeah, but you can beat it.
But you gotta stay awake.</i>

531
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,000
If you sleep, you die.

532
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,720
I can't...

533
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,680
I can't stay awake.

534
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,560
Then maybe this is a good time
to tell you I'm mad at you.

535
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Me?

536
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,080
What'd I do?

537
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,200
<i>Where do we stand? You and me.</i>

538
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,760
Because you were willing to have me
do all the dirty work

539
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
to find your mom

540
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,240
but when it came to sharing
how you actually felt about her

541
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,760
you went straight to the Bat Team.

542
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,840
Hang on.

543
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,800
Are you telling me...

544
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,000
that I hurt your feelings?

545
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
I'm telling you, you don't know me.

546
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
At all.

547
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,640
You think you do.

548
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,800
You have no idea.

549
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,280
Okay. Captive audience here.

550
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,640
What should I...

551
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,680
What should I know about...

552
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,520
Batwoman, don't fall asleep on me.

553
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Batwoman?

554
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,400
<i>Ryan! Ryan, wake up!</i>

555
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,440
Hey, hey. I got you. You're okay.

556
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,640
<i>Batwoman, are you good? Batwing?</i>

557
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,960
Someone talk to me.

558
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,160
<i>Check in!</i>

559
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,640
Yeah, yeah, she's okay, she's okay.
She's conscious.

560
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
I got her.

561
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,960
<i>Traffic cams found us two vehicles
matching the SUVs from Ace.</i>

562
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,920
Northbound, about six miles out.
Got a glimpse of Dee in the back.

563
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,040
So she's alive. Thank God.

564
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,960
Clever.

565
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,120
- Me?
- Sophie.

566
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
Me?

567
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,480
The way you kept me
from nodding off back there.

568
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
You're clever.

569
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,760
Which means you're right.

570
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,480
There was something
I didn't know about you.

571
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,680
I will take that as a thank you.

572
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,240
Are you flirting with Sophie
right now?

573
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
What? No.

574
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,880
What are you doing?

575
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,040
I know what flirting is.
What was that?

576
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,720
I am not flirting with Sophie.

577
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,520
Guys. Comms. On.

578
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,360
They just turned
onto the Tricorner Bridge.

579
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Got them.

580
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,360
Hold this.

581
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,440
We're good!

582
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,480
We lost them.

583
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Not to state the obvious

584
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,720
but you do see that impassable gap
in the bridge, correct?

585
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,520
I need a copy on the chunk of bridge
missing at your twelve o'clock.

586
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,520
Control freak.
Add that to the list too.

587
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,000
Batwoman,
what the hell are you doing?

588
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,600
It's working.

589
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,200
Gun it! Now!

590
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,520
Yeah!

591
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,720
That was bad ass.
You gotta admit. That was bad ass.

592
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,080
It was interesting.

593
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,360
Interesting?

594
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,800
Woman, you are hard to please.

595
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Hurry up! She's gaining!

596
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,600
Get out. Get out.

597
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Let her go.

598
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,520
Let's hope Victor took good notes.

599
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,400
What the hell is happening to me?

600
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,480
Not much left

601
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,040
but Renee was willing
to cross it off her list.

602
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,480
Thanks for the having my back
back there.

603
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,160
Guess it's safe to say
you figured out the glitches

604
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
in your super suit.

605
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
You could say that.

606
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,480
It's because
he disabled the fail-safe.

607
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,000
His dad designed the suit
to react to Luke's physiology.

608
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,080
A surge in heart rate shuts it down.

609
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,560
That seems counterintuitive.

610
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,440
Because he's not supposed to wear it
until he's ready.

611
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,000
Mary. What are you doing?

612
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,520
I shouldn't have cleared you
for field duty.

613
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,680
I'm sorry.

614
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,640
I put your life and this team
in jeopardy.

615
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,800
You want to worry about the team?

616
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,080
Worry about the psychopath
who held Nora at knifepoint today.

617
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,720
Alice was having a temper tantrum.

618
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,280
You were having
a physiological reaction to stress.

619
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,400
Look, I'm the team doctor.
I know what I'm talking about.

620
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,200
I hear you, Mary.

621
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,880
And thank you.

622
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,480
But I wouldn't be standing here

623
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,760
if Batwing hadn't been with me
last night.

624
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,240
And what about next time?

625
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,800
That's a risk we both take.

626
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,400
No offense, Ryan.

627
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,200
But you don't have PTSD
from being shot.

628
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,880
I don't have PTSD.

629
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,760
Okay. Give it to me straight.

630
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Are you up for this?

631
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,560
Absolutely.

632
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Okay. Then keep an eye on it.

633
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,920
But until we get these weapons
off the street

634
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,480
I need Luke by my side.

635
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,480
I had to say something.

636
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
No, you didn't.

637
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Thank you.

638
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,960
You don't sleep, do you?

639
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,280
He knows I'm his sister.

640
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,560
- How?
- He's smart and ambitious.

641
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,120
And incredibly reckless.

642
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,960
He wants to work together.

643
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,840
Behind Jada's back.

644
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,080
What do you want?

645
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
It's funny.

646
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
When it came to family,
I never allowed myself

647
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,240
to ask that question.

648
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,840
But then,
Alice ripped off the Band-Aid.

649
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm...

650
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
If I'm being real?

651
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,840
I want a mom
who knows all my food allergies

652
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,840
and tells me my skirt's too short

653
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,440
and texts my girlfriend
about TV shows they like

654
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,320
and loves me unconditionally.

655
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,040
That's what I want. I want a mom.

656
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,360
It's her loss, Ryan.

657
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,880
Yeah.

658
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,400
Well, Jada is one of the most
connected people in Gotham.

659
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,080
Which means making her my enemy
puts everyone I care about at risk.

660
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,960
So as tempting as it is
to have a brother...

661
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,920
I gotta put the team first.

662
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,040
There's a bronchodilator
to help with the breathing

663
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,760
and meds to help with the pain.

664
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,040
Should be enough to manage the pain
these next few days.

665
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,200
Are you sure
you wanna risk being out?

666
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,440
GCPD's probably out hunting for us
as we speak.

667
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,760
Batwoman took care of it.

668
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,040
Neither one of you
have anything to worry about.

669
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,200
Thank you, Dr. Hamilton.

670
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,920
Victor and I had our first date
in this park.

671
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,720
Are you sure you're not tired?
We can go home.

672
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,520
Dee, I want to breathe in
the fresh air

673
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,600
with whatever lungs I have left.

674
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,560
And then I want to let it all go.

675
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,440
You're giving up?

676
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,360
I've been dying my whole life, Dee.

677
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,320
Instead of trying to stop time,
this once

678
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,560
what do you say we enjoy
the precious moments we have left?
