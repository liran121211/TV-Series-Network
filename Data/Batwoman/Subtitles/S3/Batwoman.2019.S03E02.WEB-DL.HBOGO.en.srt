1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,720
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,520
Alice was right.
Your mom's still alive, right?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,360
If you wanna know her name...

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,760
It's not worth it.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,960
So, what's next, Batwoman?

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,400
We find
that case of Batman's trophies

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,920
before anyone else does.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,560
Why did you call me here?

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,480
Over a dozen weapons
of mass destruction

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,400
are belly up
in the Gotham River somewhere.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,400
So together, you two are gonna find

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,000
and stop every freak
who gets his hands

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,440
on one of these weapons
until each of the items on that list

14
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,800
are found and accounted for.

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Come on.

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,040
- It's not fun?
- Thank you.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,520
Nice.

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,080
Could you be a little louder?

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,800
I don't think they heard you
in Star City.

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,600
How cold do you think
the pool water is?

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
You tell me.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,240
- It's actually really warm.
- Good.

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Seriously?

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,840
Okay. I get it.

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,680
You can hold your breath
for a really long time.

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,960
But I got news for you.

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,440
The world already has an Aquaman.

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,320
He's a lot more ripped.

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,400
Derek?

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,200
If you're waiting for me to say
this isn't funny, then fine.

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,160
This isn't funny.
You can come up now.

32
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,640
By the order of the Mayor's office

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,520
{\an5}in exchange for your cooperation
in these cases

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,880
{\an5}you will be remanded
into supervised custody.

35
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,640
{\an5}If you harm
or attempt to harm any person

36
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,160
this release will be rescinded.

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,720
If you violate any of the laws
of Gotham City

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,200
this release will be rescinded.

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,560
{\an5}If you attempt to escape,
this release will be rescinded

40
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,960
{\an5}and you will spend
the remainder of your life

41
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,360
at Arkham in solitary confinement.

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,080
{\an5}Any questions?

43
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,840
{\an5}Yes.

44
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,760
Does this kind of wreck my ensemble?

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,680
{\an5}Any questions I'm likely to answer?

46
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
I got one.

47
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,320
What makes you think
any of this is gonna stick?

48
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
You.

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,760
Because you're responsible
for everything she does.

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,080
She crosses the line, your days
as a caped vigilante are over.

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,520
I might even arrange for you two
to have adjoining cells.

52
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,400
{\an5}You're tying my fate to a psychopath?

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,560
Well, more like handcuffing it,
but yes.

54
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,640
Until you two have tracked down
every last one of those toxic toys

55
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,240
from Batman's trophy case

56
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,680
{\an5}'cause it looks like
another one's already

57
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,400
{\an5}racking up a body count.

58
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,880
In a crime as cold-blooded

59
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,240
as the creature some say
is responsible,

60
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,720
two Gotham University students
are missing

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,680
and presumed dead
after blood and not much else

62
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,960
was found at the scene

63
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,160
{\an5}save for a grisly calling card

64
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,000
{\an5}which eerily resembles that
of Batman foe Killer Croc

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,840
{\an5}who terrorized Gotham
nearly two decades ago

66
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,760
{\an5}<i>in a violent reign of
reptilian terror.</i>

67
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,720
<i>And while some insist
this may just be the work</i>

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,920
<i>of an attention-seeking copycat</i>

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
<i>authorities can't say for sure</i>

70
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,040
<i>whether Gotham has
a new lizard problem</i>

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,040
{\an5}<i>or if this killer is just a crock.</i>

72
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
<i>And while initial searches for...</i>

73
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,080
{\an5}Killer Croc, aka Waylon Jones.

74
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,320
Former professional wrestler

75
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,560
{\an5}who suffered from
an unidentified infection

76
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,400
{\an5}that caused his skin to grow scales,
hence the appearance of a crocodile.

77
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,320
Now, as the infection progressed,

78
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,360
{\an5}other physical abnormalities
followed.

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,160
Elongated jaw, claws, tail.

80
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,360
I remember him.

81
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,880
{\an5}Batman killed him, right?

82
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,080
Oh, no.

83
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,880
No. No, Bruce tried to save him.

84
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
He took pity on him.

85
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,560
He always thought
that his violent tendencies

86
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,960
were a result of the infection.

87
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,880
He actually had Waynetech labs
working on a cure for his condition.

88
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,360
A way to reverse it, but...

89
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
They never found it though.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
So, what happened?

91
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,960
The GCPD happened.

92
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,560
They had their own ideas
of how to deal with KC

93
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,720
so they dropped
a truckload of thermite

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,120
{\an5}into the sewer junction.

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
{\an5}Right on top of him.

96
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,680
Lit the primer cord and ran.

97
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,840
So that tooth?

98
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,360
Pretty much all that was left of him.

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,840
And now it's loose.

100
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,200
{\an5}Okay, but how could a tooth
have created a whole another Croc?

101
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,960
{\an5}I mean, I get a lizard
can grow back a whole new tail

102
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,200
{\an5}but please tell me that tooth

103
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,040
{\an5}didn't grow back
a whole new Killer Croc.

104
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,520
{\an5}If the original Killer Croc
suffered from an infection

105
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,640
then it would've gotten
into his bloodstream.

106
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,560
{\an5}So maybe the tooth
carried the infection.

107
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,880
{\an5}And whoever found it...

108
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,360
We need to find them.

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,120
But the question is, how?

110
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,440
I have a question.

111
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,680
{\an5}Why is there a tree in here?

112
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,800
I mean, I get the whole bat motif

113
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,200
but this is a 44-storey building.

114
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,760
Surely there's a more
comfortable workspace available.

115
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,680
I need to talk to you both.

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
In private.

117
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,080
I'm just gonna hang out here.

118
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,920
Okay. If new Croc's anything
like the old one

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm gonna need Batwing on my six.

120
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,000
Where are you with figuring out
what's wrong with the suit?

121
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,480
Still working on it
but making progress.

122
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,320
Okay, well, why don't you two
put your nerd brains together

123
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,680
and try to fast-track a fix?

124
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,760
Yeah. Yeah, we'll get on it.

125
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,320
Knock knock.

126
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,320
Got my hands on a copy
of the forensics report

127
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
from the pool attack.

128
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Fair warning, the word "secretion"
comes up in several places.

129
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,520
Because apparently his drool
contains a paralytic agent

130
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,560
which renders his victims unconscious

131
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,760
allowing him to feed on them
at his leisure.

132
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,760
I should probably
put it out there right now

133
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,760
that I really do not do reptiles.

134
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,960
Okay. Let's get Alice on this.

135
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,280
If crazy stuff's going down,

136
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,520
may as well get the crazy lady's
take on it.

137
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,760
We don't really use
the C-word anymore.

138
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,280
Crazy?

139
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,480
What the hell?

140
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,320
It seems we have a guest.

141
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,840
Security cleared a landing request
for the CEO of Jeturian Industries...

142
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,120
Jada Jet.

143
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,800
She's apparently insisting on
a meeting with the Wayne CEO

144
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,720
and will not leave until she has one.

145
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Good luck with that.

146
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,680
Well, we can't exactly tell her

147
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,720
"Yeah, we don't know
where our billionaire CEO is."

148
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,640
I have a feeling she'll settle
for the acting CEO.

149
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,200
- Great.
- Who's the acting CEO?

150
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,520
Me.

151
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,280
Kate wanted to make sure
we could handle any problems

152
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
that arose in her absence.

153
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,200
Thought I'd be just a name
on a letterhead.

154
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,160
Okay, well, if Jada Jet
wants to meet Wayne's top-op

155
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,560
I may need to look the part.

156
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,040
Actually, you are in luck.

157
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,280
Because I just picked up
a ton of dry cleaning.

158
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,240
And why don't you try to find out
what our uninvited guest wants?

159
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Okay.

160
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,680
Hey.

161
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,680
I know you said
you didn't want to know this

162
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,240
but before you sit down with her,
you should probably know that...

163
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,600
that uninvited guest
is your birth mother.

164
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,400
Okay, tell the truth.

165
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,120
Does this say,
"No, I haven't been CEO

166
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,040
for just five minutes?"

167
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,800
No. It says, "I'm a confident,
put together, young black woman

168
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,840
who you were an idiot
to ever give up."

169
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,400
You think she knows?

170
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,400
Pretty big coincidence
if she doesn't.

171
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,280
Then what does she want?

172
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,160
What do you want?

173
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,400
I just wanna get through this meeting
and never see her again.

174
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,560
And I wanna get her damn helicopter
off my roof.

175
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,640
Okay, what is the absolute minimum
I need to know

176
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,000
to get through this unscathed?

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,400
What would Bruce Wayne insist
on knowing about her?

178
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,440
Probably her bra size.

179
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,200
Wiki version,

180
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,760
Jeturian Industries specializes
in micro technology.

181
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,440
Jada Jet took control after the death
of her husband a decade ago.

182
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,600
Doubled the company's wealth
in half that time.

183
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,320
She's a fighter.

184
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,520
But so are you.

185
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,840
Send her in.

186
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,520
Hey, just remember,
she never gave you anything

187
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
so she can't take anything away.

188
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,560
You got this.

189
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,280
If I had known Wayne had a new CEO,
I would have sent a gift basket.

190
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,800
Then we couldn't meet in person.

191
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,360
Ryan. And it's acting CEO.

192
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,920
So Bruce Wayne checks his stock price
from a super yacht in Belize

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
while you do all the real work?

194
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,400
Jada Jet.

195
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,960
Nice to meet you.

196
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,080
Were you and Bruce acquainted?

197
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,160
We exchanged a few heated words
years ago,

198
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,840
when he poached
one of my most valued employees.

199
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,160
If your employee allowed himself
to be poached

200
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,280
he must've felt undervalued.

201
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,920
But I'm assuming
you didn't fly 12 blocks

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,200
from your corporate headquarters

203
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
to open up old wounds.

204
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
No.

205
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,600
I'm here to address a new one.

206
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,800
There was an illegal breach
of the Jeturian Industries servers.

207
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,520
It was a very sophisticated hack.

208
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,600
But the culprit left behind
a few digital bread crumbs

209
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,400
and we followed them back
to an IP address

210
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,480
belonging to Wayne Enterprises.

211
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,800
That's why you're here?

212
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Well, it depends.

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,640
Is there anything else
I should know about?

214
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,320
Because I think corporate espionage

215
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,560
is more than enough reason
to have a little chat.

216
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,880
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

217
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,640
Ignorance of what's going on
in your company

218
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,320
doesn't pass for business acumen.

219
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,120
If you had proof, you'd be talking
to the SEC, not me.

220
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,680
Why are you here?

221
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,120
Because I didn't forge my company
into a multinational conglomerate

222
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,080
to have someone swoop in
and steal my life's work.

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,200
And because I believe warnings
are best delivered directly.

224
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,800
And I'll only give one.

225
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,720
Stay out of my business.

226
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
That won't be a problem.

227
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,360
And I think you should drop
the "acting" from your job title.

228
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,560
Denying you knew anything
about this...

229
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,680
was not your best performance.

230
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,520
Your dad programmed your suit's AI
to speak with his voice?

231
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,720
Dad, say hello to Mary.

232
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
<i>Hello, Mary.</i>

233
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,560
Give it a try.

234
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,440
Mr. Fox? Hi.

235
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,720
What was Luke like as a kid?

236
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,680
<i>Calling up photo records
for Lucas Fox, age six.</i>

237
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,440
Dad, belay that request, please.

238
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,080
It's like you can talk to him again.

239
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,640
That's...

240
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,920
That's amazing.

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, it would be more amazing

242
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,360
if the suit didn't turn off
at the worst possible times.

243
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,560
Any guesses why?

244
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,200
According to this diagnostic,
the suit's failsafe got tripped

245
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,760
causing it to shut down.

246
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What tripped it?

247
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,960
Well, the suit
tracks all kinds of medical data.

248
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,800
Biometrics, eye movement

249
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,320
electromagnetic impulses
to the brain, heart rate.

250
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,200
It's just constantly
monitoring the health status

251
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
of the person wearing it.

252
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,960
If I'm reading this right,
the suit thought you were injured.

253
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,920
Yeah, which prompted
a system-wide shutdown

254
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,680
putting the suit in safe mode.

255
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,720
Turning off in the middle of a fight

256
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,520
because it thinks
you need medical assistance

257
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,000
seems more like un-safe mode.

258
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,200
Yeah, well, there's a reason
that this thing

259
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,280
was under a tarp in my dad's lab
and not out on patrol in Gotham.

260
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,160
Still has some glitches to work out.

261
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,640
Well, why don't we start

262
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,160
by making sure there aren't
any glitches with you first?

263
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,960
If the suit thinks you're injured,
let's make sure you're not.

264
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,800
Yes.

265
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,160
So, let's get this monster.

266
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,400
Oh, I thought she found you.

267
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,080
Did I spy with my little eye
Jada Jet's chopper on the roof?

268
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,320
So you knew her name
this entire time?

269
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
She's, kind of,
like a helicopter parent,

270
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,680
just without the "parent."

271
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,880
I mean, really, what kind of mother
abandons their daughter

272
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,840
to the horrors
of the foster care system

273
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,680
to literally "Jet"-set
around the globe?

274
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,280
No, no.

275
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,520
We're not doing this.

276
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,080
Renee said I have to watch you.

277
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,000
It doesn't mean
I have to listen to you.

278
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,520
So you don't want to know
where Croc is going to strike next?

279
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Fine.

280
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,960
Well, as the resident expert
on predatory behavior

281
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,040
I had some thoughts on how Mr...

282
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,160
chooses his prey.

283
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,280
I was thinking back to my first kill.

284
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,720
For which, I chose a geriatric harpy
with an oxygen tank.

285
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,840
Now, do you know why I did that?

286
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,000
- Because you're a killer, Alice.
- No.

287
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,400
Well, yes.
But that's not the takeaway.

288
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,080
I chose her
because she was easy pickings.

289
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,680
See, when a fledgling predator
is learning how to stalk its prey

290
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,360
it seeks
to separate one from the herd.

291
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,640
So he wouldn't have gone
after two victims for his first hunt.

292
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,280
Look at you learning
to think like a killer.

293
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,280
Which means the pool
wasn't this Croc's first attack.

294
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,040
And if it wasn't for all the blood
in the deep-end...

295
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,320
They would have just been listed
as missing persons.

296
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,120
Just like the missing persons I found

297
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,160
that were last seen
at the East River shore.

298
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,520
I'm here,
two miles from the pool of attack.

299
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,320
Welcome to his hunting grounds.

300
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,160
And with the team trailing by one

301
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,560
an incredible cross-field pass
from Megan Rapinoe

302
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,320
to rookie sensation
Whitney Hutchinson,

303
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,120
who fakes out the last defender
and she's on a breakaway...

304
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,440
and scores!

305
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,680
The crowd goes wild.

306
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,600
We're all tied-up
with minutes left in the game...

307
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,080
Which the refs are calling
on account of darkness.

308
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Mom!

309
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,600
Arguing with the ref
will get you a yellow card.

310
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Fine.

311
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Gross.

312
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,640
According to the 911 call,
you're right in the area

313
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,640
where the missing girl's mother
said she was playing,

314
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,320
<i>GCPD's en route.</i>

315
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,880
Well, they'll find
about as much as we have.

316
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,040
Which isn't much.

317
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,120
There has to be
some sign of her there.

318
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,840
Drag marks
lead off in that direction.

319
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,840
But there's no body parts, no blood.

320
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,240
He didn't feed on her here.

321
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Which is understandable

322
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,920
given he did just feast
on all-you-can-eat coeds.

323
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,560
There's a whole lot of secretions,
Sophie.

324
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,360
Didn't you say O.G. Killer Croc's
saliva contained a paralytic agent?

325
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,120
That's how he's subdued his victims.

326
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,360
And then stash them away for later.

327
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,840
It's basically like a croc-pantry

328
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,080
for when he wants a doggy-bag.

329
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,680
Okay, then we need to find
where he stashed her

330
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,480
because that girl
could still be alive.

331
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Yeah.

332
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,360
Until he gets hungry.

333
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,840
Is that Croc's skin?

334
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,160
It appears our Croc is a growing boy.

335
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,160
So, what was she like? Mommy.

336
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,840
She was amazing.

337
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,440
And then you took her from me.

338
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,960
I meant birth-mommy.

339
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,680
Well, if it'll break the ice,
I'll tell you about my mom.

340
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,720
She had a really great head
on her shoulders.

341
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,040
Emphasis on the word "had."

342
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
Why do you care?

343
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,960
Why do you keep pretending not to?

344
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,080
Surely you grew up wondering
what she was like.

345
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,240
And seeing that fate,
otherwise known as me

346
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
has brought you together

347
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,200
I think I, at least, deserve to know
that my efforts have paid off.

348
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,480
You wanna know what Jada was like?

349
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
She was amazing.

350
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,400
She was confident, direct,
fearless, unapologetic.

351
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,080
She was a frigging masterclass
in taking what's hers.

352
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,320
And letting it go, apparently.

353
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,760
Did it hurt all the more knowing
she didn't want you in her life?

354
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,800
No. Because I don't want her in mine.

355
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,160
She doesn't even know who I am.

356
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,760
But I know who she is
and don't need her.

357
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,440
Now shut up
and help me find the trail.

358
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,000
Actually, I think
we just found where it ends.

359
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,520
You first.

360
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Me?

361
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,440
The one who's not wearing
impenetrable tactical armor?

362
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,120
That's who you want taking point?

363
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,480
I'm not letting you out of my sight,
Alice.

364
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
Do you really think I'm gonna run?

365
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,440
Do you really think
I'm going to believe

366
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,680
that you give a damn
about stopping this croc?

367
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,680
Yeah. I think you're gonna run
the first chance you get.

368
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,040
So it's my job
not to give you any chances.

369
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,920
Oh, that's funny. I thought it was
your job was to save a little girl.

370
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't act like you're here
to do the good deed, Alice.

371
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
You only think about yourself

372
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,440
so don't you dare use
that little girl as camouflage.

373
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,880
I was that little girl.

374
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,160
Don't act like you're the only one
with abandonment issues.

375
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,320
I will not give up on this girl
the way everyone gave up on me.

376
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,240
That smell.

377
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,360
Rotting meat.

378
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,520
Kind of takes me back
to my childhood.

379
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,360
What the hell is this?

380
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Bait.

381
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,000
This means we're not the only one
hunting this monster.

382
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,800
He's not a monster.

383
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,800
He's my son.

384
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,200
This feels a bit unnecessary.
I'm fine.

385
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,640
Well, you're keeping fit

386
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,240
in my official professional
medical opinion.

387
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,040
Let's take a look at your heart rate.

388
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,040
Looks good.

389
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,000
Let's have a listen to your lungs.

390
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,360
Good breath sounds.

391
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,160
Your heartrate is rising.

392
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,000
Rising.

393
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,120
Still rising.

394
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,240
Now, it's racing.

395
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,560
Luke, are you okay?

396
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
Yeah. Yeah. I...

397
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,520
I'm just... I'm ticklish,
and your hands are cold.

398
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,360
Yeah. Yeah.

399
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,760
You're right. I...

400
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,760
You're totally fine.

401
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,120
Totally. You're totally feeling fine.

402
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Just...

403
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,680
You can put your shirt back on.

404
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,920
Yeah. Okay.

405
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,120
If you want.

406
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,600
- You should.
- Okay.

407
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah. So like I said,
it's just a problem with the suit.

408
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,400
Yeah. Must be.

409
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,040
You think you can fix it?

410
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,440
Yeah. Yeah. It should be easy.

411
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,200
I just need to override the failsafe.

412
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,160
Are you sure that that's a good idea?

413
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,560
I mean, isn't the point of a failsafe
to keep you safe when the suit fails?

414
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,280
What if it's just
trying to protect you?

415
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,480
I think it's being
a little overprotective.

416
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,560
It kind of reminds me of a certain
newly-minted doctor that I know.

417
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,240
My boy didn't mean
to hurt those people.

418
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm sure he didn't.

419
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,000
He's not a killer.

420
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,200
Unlike that one.

421
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
No.

422
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,680
Wasn't expecting to find anybody
down here.

423
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,280
Much less a pair of celebrities.

424
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,320
What the hell are you two
doing together anyway?

425
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,680
Aren't you all supposed
to be enemies?

426
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,680
Long story.

427
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,920
She's working with me.

428
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,600
They're little short staffed
at City Hall, that's why.

429
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,840
We wanna help your son.

430
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,000
Why don't you start by telling us
what happened to him?

431
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,960
It's probably better if I show you.

432
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,560
Just before Steven
was heading off to college

433
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,680
we went on a father-son fishing trip.

434
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,920
He hooked the bluegill
on his very first cast.

435
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,520
But when we cut that thing open

436
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,920
there was something
mighty weird inside.

437
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,600
Let me guess.
Rather large crocodile tooth?

438
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,320
Yeah.

439
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,600
Steven thought it would be cool
to make it into a necklace

440
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,600
but he cut himself on the tooth.

441
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,160
Cut got infected.

442
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,120
Then Steven started changing.

443
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,960
Tried doctors.

444
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,560
None of them knew what it was.

445
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,400
They couldn't stop the changes.

446
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,880
Every day, there was a little less
Steven and a little more...

447
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
creature.

448
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,000
That's when the appetite
took hold of him.

449
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,840
And I had to chain him up.

450
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,920
But he was just too strong.

451
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,120
Too hungry.

452
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,400
He broke free.

453
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,400
I've been trying to lure him back.

454
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,480
Well, you rolled up the red carpet
for him.

455
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,640
I can't imagine
what you're going through

456
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,320
but we really do wanna help your son.

457
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,160
And we have to start by making sure

458
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,720
he doesn't hurt that little girl
or anyone else.

459
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,840
Yeah, but I just don't think he's
gonna agree to being locked up again.

460
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,400
That's where this comes in.

461
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,880
You think that thing
is strong enough for him?

462
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,600
Yeah.

463
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,120
But it's not for him.

464
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,440
It's for you.

465
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,120
I'm not gonna let you hurt my boy.

466
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,600
Batwoman.
I'm reading a huge power spike.

467
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,920
Is everything okay?

468
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,240
Batwoman, do you read me?

469
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,160
Batwoman!

470
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,920
I'm sorry. I really am.

471
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,320
But my boy's suffered enough
without you adding to it.

472
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,800
I just...

473
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,480
I just want to get him
the help he needs.

474
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,640
Yeah. Your idea of helping Stevie
is taking him away from me.

475
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,360
Locking him in a cage, or worse.

476
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,680
Jab him with needles.

477
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,920
Dissect him like
he's some kind of lab animal.

478
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,480
I'm his father.

479
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,080
I'm gonna do whatever I need to do
to keep him safe.

480
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,720
Even if that means...

481
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,280
Stevie, no. It's your dad.

482
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,440
Stevie, no!

483
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,960
Daddy issues.

484
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,760
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

485
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,200
- I just need a minute.
- Oh, that's good.

486
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,360
Because that's all I need.

487
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,680
Suckers.

488
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,600
One minute I had her,
and then everything went dead.

489
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,040
I've been trying to raise her
but I can't even...

490
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,720
<i>Batcave come in.</i>

491
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,040
Batwoman, we read you.
What happened?

492
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,920
Exactly what I said would happen.

493
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,840
Alice escaped.

494
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,320
<i>And I can't hunt her down
and save a little girl.</i>

495
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,240
Batwing?
You ready to get back in the field?

496
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,960
Yeah, I'm good to go.

497
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,080
So you and Mary fixed what was
wrong with the suit?

498
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,280
Yes. Batwing is all clear.

499
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
<i>Good.</i>

500
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,760
Alice was last headed north
through the sewer tunnels.

501
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
<i>If she's on foot,
she's gonna want to change that.</i>

502
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,840
There's a truck depot
a few miles on that trajectory.

503
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,160
That's where I'd head.

504
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,640
I hope you're right.

505
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,240
Because we need to find Alice

506
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,920
before Renee knows she's gone.

507
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,680
Help! Somebody!

508
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,120
Help me, please.

509
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,400
Oh, thank God.

510
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,040
I thought that thing was
gonna come back.

511
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,600
And he probably will
when you said he'd come.

512
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,360
Got them. We gotta skedaddle.

513
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,720
I can't walk.

514
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,360
You're gonna have to try.

515
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,880
But my leg is broken.

516
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,440
See, I'm on a really tight
schedule here,

517
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,760
so you and me trying to
three-legged race it out of here

518
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,080
is really gonna slow me down.

519
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,920
But you have to help me.

520
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,040
Fine.

521
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,600
I'm gonna help you...

522
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,440
by teaching you the lesson
that I had to learn the hard way.

523
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,200
No one is gonna save you
except yourself.

524
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,720
You are the only one
you can count on.

525
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,360
And the sooner you've learn that,
the better off you'll be.

526
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,000
You're gonna thank me for this
one day.

527
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,960
No! No, don't leave me.
Don't leave me please, please!

528
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,520
I know you're out there, Steven.

529
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,120
And I know you can hear me.

530
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,520
There are still some of you left
in there that can understand me.

531
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Okay, I do not want to hurt you.

532
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,120
I just want to help you.

533
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,520
And your father,
he just wants to help you, too.

534
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,760
He really loves you.

535
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,960
And trust me, you are really lucky
to have a parent like that,

536
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,240
someone that would do anything
to protect you.

537
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,880
Never give up on you.

538
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,720
No matter what.

539
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,120
So much for trying to
reason with you.

540
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,880
Montoya, we got a problem.

541
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,200
Just lost the signal
from Alice's tracking monitor.

542
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,040
Define "lost."

543
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,320
One moment it's reading
loud and clear

544
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,960
the next, nothing.

545
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,200
It doesn't make sense.

546
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,120
No one's ever managed
to circumvent one of those things.

547
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,320
And I tell that to Alice.

548
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,080
This means she could be anywhere.

549
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,640
Oh, great.

550
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,560
The sidekick.

551
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,960
It's Batwing.

552
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,400
Cool name.

553
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,080
Now let's see
if you can live up to it.

554
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,560
How's the suit, Luke? Any problems?

555
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,320
<i>Just this distracting voice
in my ear.</i>

556
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,560
Did you really think
you could beat me?

557
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,480
Why would I need to beat you?
We're on the same team.

558
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,920
Whether we like it or not.

559
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,440
- Was something supposed to happen?
- It already has.

560
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,000
Right now a thousand nanobots

561
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
are swimming through
your bloodstream.

562
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,160
Sending out tracking beacons
to satellites as we speak.

563
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,320
So if you wanna run,
you better be really fast.

564
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,120
Are you okay?

565
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,240
It's okay.

566
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,360
I got you.

567
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
I got you.

568
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,040
I thought I lost you.

569
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,800
Congratulations.

570
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,320
I see you've stopped the Croc,
secured the tooth

571
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,680
reunited a missing girl
with her mother

572
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,800
but what I don't see is your partner.

573
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,000
She's over there.

574
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,960
Waiting for you to chauffeur her
back to Arkham.

575
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,880
Had some technical difficulties
with that

576
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,680
but I think we've found
a better solution.

577
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,760
Right, Alice?

578
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,480
<i>Leaping lizards, Gotham?</i>

579
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,680
<i>You can add "bat" to the list
of apex predators,</i>

580
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,200
<i>because Batwoman
just took a bite out of Croc 2.0.</i>

581
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,320
<i>The rampaging reptile
has been relocated</i>

582
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,040
<i>to the not-so-natural habitat
of Arkham Asylum,</i>

583
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,640
<i>where I'm assuming
the guards' hazard pay just went up.</i>

584
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,920
<i>Thanks to the Caped Crusader</i>

585
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
<i>the Croc was denied his last meal
and missing girl Whitney Hutchinson</i>

586
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,560
<i>was reunited with her mother</i>

587
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,520
<i>in a reunion that had even the likes
of yours truly a little weepy.</i>

588
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,880
<i>And rest assured, Gotham,
these were not crocodile tears.</i>

589
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,040
You know, if you squint

590
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,800
you can just make out Jeturian
Industries from here.

591
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,000
I liked it better
when I didn't know she was there.

592
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm sorry.

593
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,360
I should never have told you.

594
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,600
It's not your fault.

595
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,640
It's nobody's fault.

596
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,400
Except hers.

597
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,880
You know, what I can't get over?

598
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,960
She paid a doctor two million dollars

599
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,320
to falsify records so no one
would ever know I was hers.

600
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,640
What kind of mom does that?

601
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,840
You don't know what her life
was like then

602
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,000
or what she was going through,
or even what her options were.

603
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,280
But there is one person
who could give you those answers.

604
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,320
I don't know if I want to know them.

605
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,280
Ryan, I know what it's like
to need to put up a wall.

606
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,600
Believe me,
I've laid a few bricks in my life.

607
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,040
But I also know
what it's like to be a girl

608
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,200
who just wants a hug from her mom.

609
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,600
What if she doesn't want me
as her daughter?

610
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,000
Then it'll be her loss

611
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,360
not yours.

612
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,560
Sorry, I banged up
the suit a little bit.

613
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Dad?

614
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,280
Dad?

615
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,160
Why isn't he talking?

616
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,880
I don't know.

617
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,120
Maybe it's because
you removed the failsafe.

618
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,320
And I think
you need to turn it back on.

619
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,400
I managed to pinpoint where
the suit still thinks you're injured

620
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
and it's the exact same place
where you were shot.

621
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,480
Yeah, but that injury's healed.

622
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,640
I know.

623
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,160
And thanks to the desert rose,
you don't even have a scar.

624
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,680
- Right.
- A physical one, anyway.

625
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,520
I think what the suit's interpreting
as physical pain

626
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,240
is actually psychological pain.

627
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,760
Mary, come on.

628
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,560
That's absurd.

629
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,640
Is it?

630
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,760
I mean, you've been through so much.

631
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,120
Just because your body's healed,
doesn't mean you have.

632
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
This is a problem.

633
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Botanist in the lab doesn't think
this vine is one of Poison Ivy's.

634
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,280
Only way to be 100% sure
is to run tests on it,

635
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,600
but the only way to do that...

636
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,800
Is to open it.

637
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,040
But he wasn't willing to do that.

638
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,360
How do you know
it wasn't the real thing?

639
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,560
Because I've seen it up close.

640
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,640
And if the real thing
is still out there, then...

641
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,040
God help us.

642
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,840
Wait, excuse me, miss.

643
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,840
I'm afraid
you can't just go in there.

644
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,600
I'm sorry, Ms. Jet.
She just walked her in.

645
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,760
It's all right.

646
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,200
I dropped in on Ms. Wilder
unannounced yesterday.

647
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,320
She's just returning the favor.

648
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,560
I thought you and I agreed

649
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,360
you'd stay out of my business.

650
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
I am.

651
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,760
This is personal.

652
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,520
Because I'm your daughter.
