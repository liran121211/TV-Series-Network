1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,980
PREVIOUSLY ON "BATWOMAN"...

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,020
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERYTHING SHE DOES

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,540
UNTIL YOU TWO HAVE
TRACKED DOWN

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,980
EVERY LAST ONE
OF THOSE TOXIC TOYS

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,460
FROM BATMAN'S TROPHY CASE.

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,070
LUKE: RIGHT NOW,
A THOUSAND NANOBOTS

7
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,680
ARE SWIMMING THROUGH
YOUR BLOODSTREAM,

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,600
SENDING OUT TRACKING
BEACONS TO SATELLITES
AS WE SPEAK.

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,080
IF I'M READING
THIS RIGHT,

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,420
THE SUIT THOUGHT
YOU WERE INJURED.

11
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,120
WHICH PROMPTED
A SYSTEM-WIDE SHUTDOWN,

12
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,510
PUTTING THE SUIT
IN SAFE MODE.

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,730
I THOUGHT
YOU AND I AGREED

14
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,080
YOU'D STAY OUT
OF MY BUSINESS.

15
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,560
THIS IS PERSONAL...

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,960
BECAUSE I'M
YOUR DAUGHTER.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,060
BUS DRIVER! WAIT!

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,110
BUS DRIVER, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT!

19
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,110
WAIT, YOU PIECE OF--
I PAY TAXES!

20
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,890
I PAY YOUR SALARY, MAN!
SCREW YOU!

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,460
YO. WANT TO SEE
SOMETHING AWESOME?

22
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,200
TAYLOR, CHECK THIS OUT.

23
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,120
T, LOOK. I FOUND IT
CATCHING FROGS
UNDER LOEB BRIDGE.

24
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,950
SHH. I'M ABOUT TO
UNLOCK A PET.

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,130
-TAYLOR, COME ON.
-EVAN, CHILL.

26
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,040
TELL THEM I'M GONNA
BE LATE.

27
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,870
NO. I'M SORRY.
IT'S NOT MY--

28
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,090
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,400
I LOVE THIS FRICKING TOWN.

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,540
GOTHAM OFFICIALS HAVE
NO COMMENT

31
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,590
ON HOW A TANK
OF LIQUID NITROGEN

32
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,680
ENDED UP IN THE HANDS
OF SCHOOLCHILDREN

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,070
AND CAUSED THIS BUS TO FREEZE.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,680
GOTHAM OFFICIALS ARE
LINKING THE FREEZING AGENT

35
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,420
TO MR. VICTOR FRIES,

36
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,210
THE DECEASED CRYOBIOLOGIST
GOTHAM REMEMBERS

37
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,340
AS ONE OF BATMAN'S
COLDEST ENEMIES.

38
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,340
MS. WILDER'S HERE
FOR YOUR MEETING, MS. JET.

39
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,610
DEWITT: OFFICIALS ARE ASKING
ANYONE WITH INFORMATION

40
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,040
AS TO WHERE THE FRIES SERUM
CAME FROM

41
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,090
TO CALL THE GCPD.

42
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,260
THAT'S WHY I TAKE
THE SUBWAY.

43
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,140
I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T
GET A CHANCE

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,010
TO FINISH
OUR CONVERSATION
LAST NIGHT.

45
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,930
I HAVE TO ADMIT

46
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,020
I NEVER PLANNED
ON MEETING YOU.

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,320
IT'S A LOT TO PROCESS.

48
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,810
I SEE YOU'VE RISEN
ABOVE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES

49
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,550
TO GET YOUR DEGREE,

50
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,120
CLIMB THE CORPORATE
LADDER,

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,290
BECOME THE ACTING CEO
OF WAYNE.

52
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,170
YOU'VE TURNED YOURSELF
INTO A RATHER REMARKABLE
YOUNG WOMAN, RYAN.

53
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,170
THANK YOU.

54
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,560
LOOK.

55
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,220
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO BLAME YOU
FOR ANYTHING.

56
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,350
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER
YOUR SITUATION WAS
AT THE TIME,

57
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,440
YOU WERE YOUNG
OR SCARED

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,310
OR IF I WAS UNPLANNED,
UNWANTED, WHATEVER,

59
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,970
NO JUDGMENT.

60
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,930
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT IT'S ALL GOOD.

61
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,750
I TURNED OUT OK.

62
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,240
RYAN, IN AN EFFORT
TO RESPECT YOUR
TIME AND MINE,

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,590
I WILL TRY TO MAKE
THIS AS SIMPLE
AS POSSIBLE.

64
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,370
I'M NOT INTERESTED
I HAVING

65
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,330
A RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOU.

66
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,550
NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I HAVE A MEETING

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,160
I NEED TO PREPARE FOR.

68
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,910
WAIT. WHY HAVE ME
AND THEN COVER IT UP?

69
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,470
ADAM, WILL YOU LET
BONNIE KNOW THAT
I'M ON MY WAY?

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,740
YOU PAID A DOCTOR
$2 MILLION TO FAKE
YOUR NAME

71
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,130
ON MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE
AND THEN MADE IT LOOK LIKE

72
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,090
YOU DIED SO I NEVER
CAME LOOKING FOR YOU.

73
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,400
WHAT WERE YOU
AFRAID OF?

74
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,010
SOMETIMES, IT'S
BETTER TO STOP
ASKING QUESTIONS.

75
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,010
SO YOU INVITED ME HERE
JUST TO SHOW ME THE DOOR?

76
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,930
IF YOU CONTINUE
TO TRY TO HAVE

77
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,980
ANYTHING TO DO
WITH MY FAMILY,

78
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,020
I WILL PERSONALLY
SEE TO IT THAT YOU

79
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,500
AND WAYNE ENTERPRISES

80
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,860
WILL COME TO SEVERELY
REGRET THAT DECISION.

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,120
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHO MY BIRTH MOTHER WAS.

82
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,650
NOW I KNOW.

83
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,610
SOMEONE NOT WORTH MY TIME.

84
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,910
I'M GLAD WE'RE
ON THE SAME PAGE.

85
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,180
MAN: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I MISSED IT?

86
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,870
DAMN. SEE, THIS IS WHAT
I GET

87
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,360
FOR SECOND-GUESSING
MY KICKS.

88
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,530
I WENT DEEP VAULT
FOR YOU, WILDER.

89
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,970
WORTH IT?

90
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,490
I ACTUALLY USED TO HAVE
THOSE IN BLUE.

91
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,450
THERE YOU GO.
WORTH IT.

92
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,280
SEE, WE'RE
CONNECTING ALREADY.

93
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,930
MARQUIS, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY

94
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,500
TO "METROPOLIS"
MAGAZINE'S

95
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,150
INFLUENCER PARTY
TONIGHT.

96
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,760
I WAS. THEN I HEARD
YOU WERE SITTING DOWN

97
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,460
WITH A NEW, YOUNG CEO
WITHOUT ME,

98
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,290
AND I FIGURED IT WAS
A SCHEDULING OVERSIGHT,

99
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,550
SO I BOUNCED.

100
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,680
I AM SORRY.
WHO ARE YOU?

101
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,470
YOU'RE NEW NEW.
THAT'S COOL.

102
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,860
I WON'T TAKE
ANY OFFENSE.

103
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,860
I'M JETURIAN INDUSTRIES'
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT.

104
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,870
MARQUIS JET.

105
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,430
ALSO KNOWN
AS MY SON.

106
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,180
YOU WERE VERY CLEAR
ABOUT KNOWING
THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM.

107
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,750
YOU WEREN'T EVEN SURE
IF YOU WANTED TO GET
TO KNOW JADA,

108
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,960
SO KNOWING SHE HAD
ANOTHER KID,

109
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,790
IT WOULD HAVE JUST
COMPLICATED IT MORE.

110
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,540
THE KID SHE KEPT
WHILE SHE GAVE
ME AWAY.

111
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,320
WAS HE COOL
AT LEAST?

112
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,150
I HAVE NO IDEA.
JADA KICKED ME OUT
OF THERE SO FAST,

113
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,800
I DIDN'T EVEN GET
TO GET MY PARKING VALIDATED.

114
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,680
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY
I WANTED TO KEEP
THAT DOOR CLOSED.

115
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,070
-SO WHAT NOW?
-YOU DIDN'T HEAR?

116
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,770
MR. FREEZE'S
LIQUID NITROGEN CAN

117
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,290
GOT IN THE HANDS
OF A BUNCH OF EIGHT GRADERS.

118
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,600
I NEED TO FIND IT.

119
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,120
I MEAN ABOUT YOUR MOM.

120
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,910
WHAT CAN I DO?
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

121
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,690
MARY: YOU POOR THING.

122
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,480
-I'M SO SORRY, RYAN.
-THANKS.

123
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,130
IT SUCKS,
BUT...I'LL BE FINE.

124
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,260
OK. FIRST,
HOW DARE SHE,

125
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,960
AND SECOND, HOW'D YOU
KNOW SHE WAS STILL ALIVE?

126
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,840
OK. EVERYONE WAS LIKE,
"BOO-HOO.

127
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,890
EVIL ALICE KILLED
RYAN'S MOM."

128
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,060
AS IF IT WASN'T
BAD ENOUGH.

129
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,500
AND NOW AGAINST ALL ODDS,

130
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,380
I MIRACULOUSLY PROVIDE HER
WITH ANOTHER ONE,

131
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,160
AND YOU GUYS ARE JUST
BITCHING AND MOANING--

132
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,040
CAN I GET SOME WATER?
PLEASE, SOMEONE.

133
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,780
RYAN: OK. PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVE SOME INFO

134
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,870
ON THIS FREEZE STUFF.

135
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,480
SO THE CANISTER
ITSELF IS A COMPACT,

136
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,000
CUSTOM-BUILT
VACUUM FLASK

137
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,350
THAT MAKES ITS CONTENTS,

138
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,480
AKA THE FREEZE STUFF,

139
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,050
MORE CONCENTRATED
AND SEEMINGLY

140
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,140
LESS DANGEROUS THAN IT IS.

141
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,920
A LITTLE GOES
A LONG WAY.

142
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,010
SO THE KID LIKELY FOUND IT
NEAR THE GOTHAM RIVER,

143
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,930
THOUGHT IT WAS
A HARMLESS DRY-ICE GUN.

144
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,620
ALICE: ALL RIGHT.
I'M REALLY NOT FEELING WELL.

145
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,450
I THINK IT'S ALL THESE
TRACKING NANOBOTS
INSIDE ME.

146
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,370
MY SKIN, IT, UM,
FEELS LIKE SPIDERS ARE
RUNNING THROUGH MY VEINS.

147
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,420
OK. THAT'S NOT
A THING.

148
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,240
LUKE: WAYNE TECH USES
NANOBOT INJECTABLES

149
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,250
IN THEIR RESEARCH
ALL THE TIME.

150
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,160
RYAN: ARE YOU
CALLING IN SICK?
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?

151
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,080
MONTOYA WANTS US
TO WORK TOGETHER.

152
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,080
MY TEAM GETS A BEAD
ON THE BATMAN TROPHY,

153
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,950
AND THEN YOU USE
YOUR CREEPY-ASS BRAIN

154
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,430
TO HELP US FIGURE OUT
WHERE IT IS.

155
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,220
AND I WOULD LOVE
NOTHING MORE TRULY

156
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,180
THAN TO TALK
ABOUT AN ERRANT CAN
OF LIQUID NITROGEN,

157
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,050
BUT I AM FINDING IT
VERY DIFFICULT TO FOCUS

158
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,570
THROUGH MY PAIN,

159
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,270
AND I WOULD HATE
MS. MONTOYA TO THINK

160
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,400
THAT OUR LITTLE ARRANGEMENT
DIDN'T WORK ON ACCOUNT

161
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,450
OF ME BEING IN A HOSTILE
WORK ENVIRONMENT.

162
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,930
RYAN: OH, MY GOD.

163
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,800
WHAT DID I DO
TO DESERVE THIS?

164
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,710
YOU KNOW, IT'S PROBABLY
NOT THE WORST THING

165
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,410
IF YOU GIVE ALICE
THE SICK DAY.

166
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,940
WHY DOES SHE GET
A DAY OFF?

167
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,720
BECAUSE I KNOW
WHERE THE CANISTER IS.

168
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,070
PLUS I DOUBT THAT
YOU'LL WANT

169
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,640
ONE OF GOTHAM'S
MOST WANTED WITH YOU

170
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,120
BREAKING INTO THE GCPD.

171
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
-I'M IN.
-COOL.

172
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,210
I CAN ONLY KEEP
THE CAMERAS DARK FOR 5 MINUTES,

173
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,780
SO START LOOKING.

174
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,550
YOU SURE IT'S HERE?

175
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,550
LOGS SAY IT WAS TAGGED
AND FILED AT 10:07 A.M.
THIS MORNING

176
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,550
NO RECORD OF ANYONE
REMOVING IT.

177
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,690
I THINK I KNOW WHY BATMAN
KEPT HIS OWN EVIDENCE LOCKER.

178
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,440
WHAT IS THIS?

179
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,230
WHAT DID
YOU DO?

180
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,100
I FOUND IT, NORA.

181
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,970
WE CAN FINALLY FINISH
WHAT VICTOR STARTED.

182
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,150
YOU STOLE VICTOR'S
FREEZE TANK?

183
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,710
NORA FRIES!

184
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,890
HA HA HA!

185
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,720
YOU ARE GONNA TELL ME

186
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,590
HOW YOU WERE FROZEN
FOR 20 YEARS...

187
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,340
AND LIVED TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

188
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,950
LUKE: I WAS ABLE TO COMPARE
ENTRY AND EXIT FOOTAGE

189
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,260
FROM THE TIME OF THE THEFT
AND TRACK DOWN

190
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,000
WHO BROKE INTO
THE EVIDENCE ROOM FIRST.

191
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,870
-ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
-DEE WORKS

192
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,870
AT THE GCPD
PROCESSING DESK.

193
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,740
SHE'S ONE OF A FEW PEOPLE
WHO HAVE ACCESS

194
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,270
TO THE EVIDENCE ROOM
SECURE BACK AREA.

195
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,050
DEE ALSO CALLED IN
SICK TODAY,

196
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,920
AND THIS LADY'S NEVER
CALLED IN SICK ONCE
IN 20 YEARS.

197
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,490
OK, BUT ALL THE ITEMS
IN THE EVIDENCE ROOM,

198
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,490
THERE HAS TO BE
SOMETHING EASIER
TO FENCE.

199
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,360
WHICH IS WHAT I THOUGHT.
WHY WOULD ANYONE

200
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,800
RISK EVERYTHING
FOR THIS STUFF APART

201
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,540
FROM THE GUY
WHO INVENTED IT?

202
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,240
WAIT. YOU MEAN
THE MR. FREEZE DUDE?

203
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,460
-I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.
-VICTOR FRIES. HE IS.

204
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,940
BRILLIANT CRYOBIOLOGIST,

205
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,460
HALF A DOZEN DOCTORATES,

206
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,860
STILL INSISTED ON BEING
CALLED MR. FREEZE,

207
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,820
BUT THEN AGAIN,
CAPTAIN COLD WASN'T
REALLY A CAPTAIN, SO...

208
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,560
WHO'S THAT?

209
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
AH, YES.

210
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,690
THAT IS NORA FRIES

211
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,650
IN AN ARKHAM INTAKE PHOTO
TAKEN 3 YEARS AGO.

212
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,780
SO NORA WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH MacGREGOR'S SYNDROME,

213
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,960
A PROGRESSIVE LUNG DISEASE
THAT AT THE TIME

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,830
OF HER DIAGNOSIS
HAD NO CURE,

215
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,010
SO VICTOR CREATED A UNIQUE
LIQUID NITROGEN FORMULA

216
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,440
TO SUPPLY HER CRYOCHAMBER
THAT KEPT HER IN STASIS

217
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,060
UNTIL A CURE
COULD BE FOUND.

218
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,970
AND HE DIED
BEFORE IT HAPPENED.

219
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,230
WELL, EVENTUALLY,
HER CRYOCHAMBER RAN OUT

220
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,190
OF VICTOR'S
LIQUID NITROGEN COCKTAIL,

221
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,760
SO WHEN SHE THAWED,
NORA LEARNED

222
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,020
THAT DOCTORS FOUND
A CURE FOR MacGREGOR'S,

223
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,550
SO THEY ADMINISTERED IT,
BUT SHE WAS SO DISORIENTED

224
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,330
BY THE 20-YEAR TIME GAP
THAT OFFICIALS

225
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,810
SENT HER TO ARKHAM.

226
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,550
SHE ESCAPED IN A BREAKOUT
3 YEARS AGO

227
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,120
AND HAS BEEN MIA
EVER SINCE.

228
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,080
-SO WHAT'S THE CONNECTION?
-DEE SMITHY IS

229
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,390
NORA FRIES' SISTER.

230
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,430
SEND ME THE ADDRESS.
I'LL FIRE UP
THE BATMOBILE.

231
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,560
OK.

232
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,960
UH, WHO'S BOUNCING
A BASKETBALL

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,310
OFF OF BRUCE WAYNE'S
SHELF OF FIRST EDITIONS?

234
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,750
THAT WOULD BE...
MY BROTHER.

235
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,150
OOH. THE GIRL'S
GOT REFLEXES.
YOU PLAY?

236
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,240
YEAH. IN ALL MY SPARE TIME.

237
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,070
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

238
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,200
FREE FOR A DRINK
LATER?

239
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,160
JADA DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT ME?

240
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,550
TELL ME WHAT, WILDER?

241
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,730
SHE MADE IT VERY CLEAR
SHE WANTED

242
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,080
NOTHING TO DO
WITH WAYNE ENTERPRISES

243
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,520
AND THAT I HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH HER.

244
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,130
OOH! YOU RUFFLED
SOME FEATHERS.

245
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,260
WHAT'D YOU DO?
BECAUSE NORMALLY,

246
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,310
SHE EATS THAT RAGS
TO RICHES STUFF UP.

247
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,490
REMINDS HER OF HERSELF.

248
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,490
SO YOU THINK YOU
KNOW MY STORY?

249
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,020
27, RAISED IN THE SYSTEM,
STINT AT BLACKGATE,

250
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,500
AND NOW...ACTING CEO
OF WAYNE.

251
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,670
OH, AND, UH,

252
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,330
YOU'RE MY SISTER.

253
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,760
SHE TOLD YOU THAT?

254
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,030
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

255
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,810
HOW DID YOU FIGURE
THIS OUT?

256
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,340
OH, NANNYIES TALK

257
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,990
LIKE MINE DID WHEN MOMS
DISAPPEARED

258
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,770
FOR 9 MONTHS STRAIGHT.

259
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,380
HEARD ABOUT IT
AS A KID YEARS LATER.

260
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,780
WHY HER AND MY OLD MAN
DIDN'T SPEAK

261
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,690
FOR A FULL SUMMER
AFTER THAT.

262
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
SO IT WAS AN AFFAIR.

263
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,480
THEN WE FAST FORWARD
27 YEARS,

264
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,440
HERE'S SOME BADASS CHICK
ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN ME,

265
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,840
SHOWS UP AT THE COMPANY,
THROWS MY MOM OFF HER GAME,

266
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,790
AND HAS GOT HER SCHEDULING
ALL THESE SECRET MEETINGS

267
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,190
WHILE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
OUT OF TOWN.

268
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,020
POOF! HERE YOU ARE,

269
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,840
THE SISTER I NEVER KNEW
I HAD.

270
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,020
I--I WOULD ASK YOU
FOR A HUG,

271
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,200
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
COULD KICK MY ASS, SO...

272
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,810
PRETTY SURE YOUR MOM
MIGHT BEAT ME TO IT.

273
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,200
OUR MOM.

274
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,300
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE HERE.

275
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,990
BUT I ALREADY PICKED OUT
MY OFFICE NEXT TO YOURS.

276
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,820
-WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
-BECAUSE IT'S THE CORNER.

277
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,300
WAY BETTER VIEW.
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

278
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,650
WHY YOU'RE IN THIS PLACE.

279
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,090
IT'S SO...LIMITED.

280
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,530
YOU WANT TO PARTNER
WITH WAYNE ENTERPRISES?

281
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,490
MOM THINKS THAT I'M
IN THIS

282
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,100
JUST FOR THE PJs
AND FREE CONCERT TICKETS,

283
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,490
WHICH WOULD MEAN I'D BE
AN HONORARY VP

284
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,240
UNTIL SHE'S DEAD
IN HER LOUBIES

285
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,370
UNLESS I MAKE MY MARK,

286
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,280
SHOW HER WHAT I CAN DO.

287
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,420
SAME WITH YOU.

288
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,200
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HER
WHAT SHE MISSED OUT ON

289
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,200
THE LAST 30 YEARS?

290
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,120
WHAT DO YOU SAY, SIS?

291
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,860
WANT TO JOIN FORCES,

292
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,560
SHOW HER WHAT WE GOT?

293
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,170
LUKE: YOU SAID YOU'D
THINK ABOUT IT?

294
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,950
RYAN: I COULDN'T
EXACTLY ASK HIM TO
WAIT IN THE LOBBY

295
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,520
WHILE I FOLLOWED THE 20
ON A MISSING FREEZE TANK.

296
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,300
WHAT EXACTLY IS THERE
TO THINK ABOUT?

297
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,960
WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE
TO ACTUALLY HAVE A BROTHER.

298
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,870
OK. I GET THAT,
BUT JADA JET

299
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,740
DIDN'T EARN HER SPOT
ON THE "FORBES" 150

300
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,700
BY MAKING IDLE THREATS.

301
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,400
SHE LITERALLY PROMISED
TO DESTROY WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

302
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,400
OK, OK.
I'M IN DEE'S HOUSE.

303
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,880
WE'RE LATE TO THE PARTY.
SOMEONE WAS HERE,

304
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,710
AND IT GOT UGLY.

305
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,320
NO SIGN OF DEE
OR THE FREEZE TANK

306
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,370
OR THE ROOMMATE
WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

307
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,420
I THINK NORA'S
LIVING HERE.

308
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,160
WAIT. I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THEY FOUND THE CURE

309
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,940
FOR MacGREGOR'S SYNDROME.

310
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,860
THEY DID. ACCORDING
TO NORA'S MEDICAL RECORDS,

311
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,510
SHE RECEIVED IT
YEARS AGO.

312
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,080
OK. WELL,
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,

313
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,600
SHE'S STILL SICK.

314
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,130
MAYBE IT DIDN'T TAKE.

315
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,430
MAYBE DEE WANTED TO
PUT NORA BACK

316
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,000
IN HER CRYOCHAMBER TO
SAVE HER SISTER'S LIFE.

317
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,790
SO WHO BROKE
INTO THE HOUSE?

318
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,960
SOMEONE AFTER
THE SAME THING?

319
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,050
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU
KNOW WHERE ONE WOULD
FIND A CRYOCHAMBER.

320
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,880
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ACE CHEMICALS?

321
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,800
ONLY THAT NO GOOD THING
EVER HAPPENED THERE.

322
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,670
AND I'M SENDING YOU
THE ADDRESS NOW.

323
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,420
HERE. EVERYTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT CRYOGENICS.

324
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,640
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW
KEPT METICULOUS NOTES.

325
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,990
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

326
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,730
NORA: JUST LEARNED MY SISTER
WAS GONNA PUT ME ON ICE,

327
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,650
AND NOW I GOT A GUN
ON MY BAD HIP.

328
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M GONNA DO, RUN?

329
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,390
THESE ARE THE MUSINGS
OF A MADMAN.

330
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,530
I CAN'T READ THIS.
YOU GOT TO SHOW ME
HOW IT WORKS.

331
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,180
HOW ON EARTH WOULD WE KNOW
THE FIRST THING ABOUT THAT?

332
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,270
THEY DIDN'T EVEN OFFER
SCIENCE TO WOMEN

333
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,100
WHEN I WAS
AT UNIVERSITY.

334
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,930
SHOW ME...
OR SHE DIES.

335
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,660
BP AND HEART RATE
TOTALLY NORMAL.

336
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,620
98.6.

337
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,360
GLUCOSE LEVELS ARE
AS AVERAGE AS THEY COME,

338
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,190
WHICH ARE ALL
COMMON SYMPTOMS

339
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,850
OF FAKING IT!

340
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,670
OHH!

341
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,290
YOU KNOW, WITH
CARE LIKE THIS,

342
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,290
IT'S AMAZING YOU
MANAGED TO SAVE
ANY LIVES.

343
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,290
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH YOU, ALICE,

344
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,250
AT LEAST NOT PHYSICALLY.

345
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,130
I'M SORRY. I THINK
MY DANGEROUSLY HIGH FEVER

346
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,130
IS INTERFERING
WITH WHATEVER YOU
ARE HINTING AT.

347
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,310
THE POSTCARDS
FROM DAD? HEH.

348
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,620
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.
I WAS ACTUALLY

349
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,100
KIND OF JEALOUS OF YOU
WHEN I THOUGHT

350
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,840
THAT HE WAS WRITING
TO YOU AND NOT ME,

351
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,270
AND THEN WHEN I FOUND OUT
THAT IT WAS JUST YOU

352
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,190
BEING TOTALLY DELUSIONAL,

353
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,190
IT HONESTLY WAS A RELIEF.

354
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,980
I'M SO GLAD
MY MADNESS HAS SOOTHED
YOUR DADDY ISSUES.

355
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,980
DOES THAT HAPPEN A LOT,
THOSE DELUSIONS?

356
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,590
-JUST THE ONCE.
-MM-HMM.

357
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,850
SO THIS WHOLE PERFORMATIVE
"I'M SICK"...

358
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,950
THING ISN'T, HMM,
I DON'T KNOW,

359
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,340
A CRY FOR HELP MAYBE?

360
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,340
I LEARNED
A LONG TIME AGO

361
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,350
THAT CRIES FOR HELP
DON'T WORK.

362
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,740
LOOK. I'M
AN OFFICIAL DOCTOR NOW,

363
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,180
SO IF YOU NEED
ACTUAL HELP,

364
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,010
I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

365
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,490
SO...DO YOU?

366
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,490
I SEE WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE.

367
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,970
YOU COULDN'T HELP
BATBOY,

368
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,580
SO NOW YOU'RE
BURDENING ME

369
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,930
WITH YOUR
SAVIOR COMPLEX.

370
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,460
-BATBOY?
-YEAH. LUKE.

371
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,330
IT SAYS IN HIS FILES
HE'S HAVING SOME

372
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,200
UNFORTUNATE
PERFORMANCE ISSUES.

373
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,940
YOU WENT
THROUGH MY FILES?

374
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,510
OK. THAT CABINET
IS LOCKED.

375
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,600
I BROKE OUT
OF THE CROWS
WITH A FISHING LINE.

376
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,080
YOUR OFFICE WAREHOUSE
CABINET DIDN'T STAND
A CHANCE.

377
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,690
ANYWAY, IT'S YOUR FAULT
FOR TAKING FOREVER

378
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,950
TO SEE ME AND NOT
GIVING ME ANY MAGAZINES.

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,260
I ASSUME THAT BATWOMAN
KNOWS SHE'S WORKING

380
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,440
WITH AN EMOTIONAL
TICKING TIME BOMB.

381
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,790
BATWOMAN DOESN'T BREAK
INTO MY FILE CABINET

382
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,270
BECAUSE IT'S CALLED
DOCTOR-PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY.

383
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,450
PERFECT. I'M NOT
A DOCTOR,

384
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,840
SO WHAT'S THE ISSUE?

385
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,110
HMM. NOW YOU'RE
IN THE MIDDLE.

386
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,190
THAT IS A DILEMMA.

387
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,460
DO YOU TELL BOSSY PANTS
BATWOMAN

388
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,850
THAT LUKE'S IGNORING
HIS PTSD SYMPTOMS,

389
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,420
OR DO YOU KEEP
LUKE'S SECRET

390
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,070
BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM?

391
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,820
I DO NOT LOVE LUKE...
LIKE THAT.

392
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,860
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

393
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,040
SURE, BUT A LITTLE
PIECE OF ADVICE.

394
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,780
I'D KEEP THAT
TO YOURSELF.

395
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,780
TELLING RYAN
WILL ONLY, UM,

396
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,870
FILL YOU
WITH RESENTMENT.

397
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,310
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

398
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,660
BECAUSE SHE'LL
IGNORE YOU, MARY.

399
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,270
I'M SORRY. DO YOU
NOT SEE YOUR PLACE
ON THIS TEAM?

400
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,230
I'VE BEEN ON IT
FOR LESS THAN A MONTH,

401
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,540
AND IT'S ALREADY
GLARINGLY OBVIOUS.

402
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,190
THEY DON'T SEE YOU
UNLESS THEY NEED YOU

403
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,980
JUST LIKE DADDY

404
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,280
AND JUST LIKE KATE,

405
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,770
SO IF YOU WANT TO
GO ON LIKING THEM,

406
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,460
IT'S PROBABLY BEST
YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE.

407
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,950
WATCH YOUR 6. GOT A READ
ON SOME MAJOR FIREPOWER

408
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,740
IN THE SOUTH PARKING LOT.

409
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,910
I GOT EYES ON 3 MORE INSIDE.

410
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,700
LUKE: COPY THAT.
BE CAREFUL, BATWOMAN.

411
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,490
WOMAN: THIS IS GOING TO MAKE
MY CLIENT VERY HAPPY.

412
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,660
NORA: UNTIL HE REALIZES
IT DOESN'T WORK.

413
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,580
DEE: CAN IT, NORA.

414
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,100
DO YOU THINK WE'RE
WALKING OUT OF HERE?

415
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,580
HAVE YOU SEEN
THEIR FACES?

416
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,370
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT DOESN'T WORK?

417
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,240
DEE: IT WORKS FINE.

418
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,630
JUST A LITTLE DUST,
A FEW DISINFECTANT WIPES.

419
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,110
THE CHAMBER WORKS.
IT'LL FREEZE YOU SOLID,

420
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,420
BUT YOU DIE OF HYPOTHERMIA
EVENTUALLY.

421
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,730
WELL, THEN WHAT'S THE POINT
OF THIS STUFF?

422
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,820
CONSTANT EXPOSURE
TO THE FREEZE SERUM

423
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,030
WILL STOP TIME
AND KEEP YOU FROM AGING.

424
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,910
COMING OUT OF IT'S
A WHOLE OTHER STORY.

425
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,000
LOOK. MY HUSBAND
WAS BRILLIANT,

426
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,130
BUT HE DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT ONCE I WAS RELEASED

427
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,000
FROM THE CHAMBER
AND THAWED

428
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,830
TIME WOULD CATCH UP.

429
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,140
3 YEARS AGO, I CAME OUT
OF THAT THING A 34-YEAR-OLD,

430
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,830
AND LOOK AT ME NOW.

431
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,620
AT THIS RATE, I'LL BE
122 BY CHRISTMAS.

432
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,790
BUT YOUR SISTER'S ABOUT
TO LOCK YOU BACK INSIDE OF IT.

433
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,320
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP
MY SISTER FROM DYING

434
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,670
IS TO PUT HER BACK
ON HER ICE TILL
I CAN FIND A WAY

435
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,060
TO SLOW THE AGING.

436
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,630
THAT'S SOME DEDICATION.

437
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,550
WELL, IF WHAT SHE'S
SAYING IS TRUE,

438
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,380
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A MAJOR PROBLEM.

439
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,860
MAN: AGH!

440
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,820
ADD ME TO THAT LIST.

441
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,210
GET OUT OF HERE.

442
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,880
-CAN YOU WALK?
-BETTER THAN HER.

443
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,580
OK. THERE'S A CLINIC
ON RUCKA AND BENNETT.

444
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,230
IT'S NOT FAR. THEY'LL
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

445
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,850
-I CAN'T LEAVE DEE.
-I'LL FIND HER.

446
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,560
UNH!

447
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,890
A GUN? COULD YOU BE
MORE BASIC?

448
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,380
COME ON.
LET'S DO THIS.

449
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,950
RAAH!

450
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,430
COME ON!

451
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,700
WOMAN: HYAH!

452
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,810
ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE
THIS THING IN ACTION.

453
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,820
UH-UH.

454
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,650
MY CLIENT WANTS TO KNOW
HOW IT WORKS

455
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,950
WITHOUT WASTING
THE PRODUCT.

456
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,260
BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
OF VICTOR'S LIQUID NITROGEN.

457
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,610
THE FORMULA IS WHAT
KEEPS HER ALIVE.

458
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,400
TURNING ON THE MACHINE
WITHOUT IT WILL JUST

459
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,830
BLAST HER WITH COLD AIR.

460
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,660
SHE'LL DIE
FROM HYPOTHERMIA.

461
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I CARE?

462
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,320
I'M NOT KILLING BATWOMAN.

463
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,060
HOW LONG DO YOU
THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE

464
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,370
FOR MY DRIVER TO
FIND YOUR SISTER

465
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,060
JUST HOBBLING DOWN
RUCKA STREET

466
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,020
AND MAKE HER ROADKILL?

467
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,590
TURN IT ON,

468
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,290
OR YOUR SISTER DIES.

469
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,000
HMM.

470
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,220
IF BATWOMAN
DOESN'T DIE,

471
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,400
YOU DO.

472
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,090
TAKE HER TO THE CAR.

473
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,720
SHH.

474
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,170
BATWOMAN TO BATCAVE.

475
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,000
DEFINITELY NEED
A LITTLE HELP.

476
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,960
WHOA. TALK TO ME.
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

477
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,180
THEY TRAPPED ME
IN THE CRYOCHAMBER.

478
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,270
-WHAT?!
-GET ME THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

479
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,050
I'M PULLING UP
YOUR BIOMETRICS.

480
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,140
YOUR CORE
BODY TEMPERATURE'S
DROPPING LIKE CRAZY.

481
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,010
HEH. YEAH.
I'M PRETTY AWARE OF THAT.

482
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,540
OK, OK, OK.

483
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,540
ACCESS THE SUIT'S
TEMP REGULATOR.

484
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,760
YEAH.

485
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,460
OH, BOY.

486
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,850
SERIOUSLY, YOU COULDN'T
KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF?

487
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,850
THE REGULATOR
MUST HAVE FROZEN UP.

488
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,550
YOU HAVE 10 MINUTES
BEFORE FULL-BLOW
HYPOTHERMIA.

489
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,900
YOU NEED TO STAY
AWAKE, OK?

490
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,510
LUKE...

491
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,300
YOU NEED TO SUIT UP.

492
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,690
HELP DEE.
THEY TOOK HER SOMEWHERE.

493
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,520
WHAT? NO. I GOT TO
KEEP YOU FROM PASSING OUT.

494
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,350
I AM OK. GO FIND HER.

495
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,090
IF YOU PASS OUT,
IT'S OVER, RYAN.

496
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,840
I WON'T. OK?

497
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,580
GO FIND HER.

498
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,580
I PROMISED...

499
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,060
I PROMISED NORA I WOULD
PROTECT HER SISTER.

500
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,240
PLEA--PLEASE DON'T LET ME
DIE A LIAR.

501
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,290
NORA: ANY WORD FROM DEE?

502
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,990
BATWOMAN'S ON IT.

503
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,990
SHE WON'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO YOUR SISTER.

504
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,910
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
CATARACT SURGERY?

505
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,780
IT WOULD BE A BIT
LIKE CLEANING THE WINDOWS
ON THE HINDENBURG.

506
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,610
DR. HAMILTON, I WAS
34 FOR 2 DECADES.

507
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,920
I GOT OUT AND STARTED
AGING DOUBLE-TIME.

508
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,310
LIFE'S CATCHING UP
TO ME.

509
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,310
WHY STAND IN THE WAY?

510
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,970
THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED--

511
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,360
TO LITERALLY STAND
IN THE WAY OF TIME.

512
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,230
I HAVE AN IDEA!
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT I WANT.

513
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,020
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

514
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,630
GET THESE NANOBOTS OUT
OF ME NOW!

515
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,630
YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT

516
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,850
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY
THING PREVENTING YOU

517
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
FROM ESCAPING GOTHAM
ENTIRELY.

518
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,640
OH. I WONDER WHY I'D
WANT THEM GONE.

519
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,030
GET THEM OUT!

520
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,470
BATWOMAN WOULD KILL ME.

521
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,650
AND I WILL KILL NORA.

522
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,300
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND
CAUSE AND EFFECT?

523
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,690
-HOW DO YOU HAVE AN MD?
-LET HER.

524
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,170
MARY: WHAT?
ALICE: WHAT?

525
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,790
I AM SO SICK
OF PEOPLE SACRIFICING

526
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,310
THEIR LIVES FOR ME--
MY HUSBAND, MY SISTER,

527
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,440
THE RESEARCH,
THE LOST YEARS,
THE DESPERATION.

528
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:48,580
FOR WHAT? SO I COULD BE
TRAPPED ALL OVER AGAIN?

529
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,840
SO YOU WANT ME TO
KILL YOU?

530
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,150
COULD YOU BE
A WORSE HOSTAGE?

531
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,460
UHH!

532
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,890
YOU.

533
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,680
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

534
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,460
I LITERALLY JUST
LET HER GO.

535
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,470
I WAS BEING NICE TO YOU.

536
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:10,690
NICE? YOU THINK
I WANT...NICE?

537
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,210
YOU THINK I WANT
THIS STUPID ARRANGEMENT

538
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,210
WITH BATWOMAN, WHO
I CAN'T EVEN STAND,

539
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,610
AND LITTLE
MISS JUDGY TWO-SHOES

540
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,440
BEING NICE?
HA HA HA!

541
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,920
HEH. HEH.

542
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,140
IT'S NO WONDER I'M
LOSING MY FREAKING MIND.

543
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,240
I AM...SO SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

544
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,240
UM...BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
SHE'S MY SISTER.

545
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,290
HEH. YOU CERTAINLY
FIGHT LIKE IT,

546
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,770
BUT I'VE GOT TO SAY
I UNDERSTAND HER.

547
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,210
YOU UNDERSTAND THE WOMAN WHO
JUST HAD YOU AT KNIFEPOINT?

548
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,730
I FOLLOW THE NEWS.

549
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,040
SHE'S BEEN TRAPPED
HER WHOLE LIFE,

550
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,870
AND NOW SHE WANTS
HER FREEDOM.

551
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,440
DOES YOUR SISTER KNOW
THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT?

552
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,440
DEE'S WASTED TOO MANY
YEARS OF HER LIFE

553
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,960
TRYING TO FIX ME.

554
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,440
I LOVE HER TOO MUCH
TO TELL HER THE TRUTH.

555
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,060
SOPHIE, ON COMMS:
BATCAVE TO BATWOMAN.

556
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,500
BATCAVE TO BATWOMAN.

557
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,850
RYAN: SOPHIE.

558
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:28,160
AHH. BATWING'S EN ROUTE.
ARE YOU GOOD?

559
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,590
I'M FADING.

560
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,250
I JUST WANT TO SLEEP.

561
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,120
YEAH. THAT'S
THE HYPOTHERMIA TALKING.

562
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,820
YEAH. WELL, IT'S
AWFULLY CONVINCING.

563
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,340
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN
BEAT IT,

564
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,690
BUT YOU GOT TO
STAY AWAKE.

565
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,390
IF YOU SLEEP,
YOU DIE.

566
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,740
OHH. I CAN'T...
I CAN'T STAY AWAKE.

567
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,180
THEN MAYBE THIS IS
A GOOD TIME TO TELL YOU

568
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,620
I'M MAD AT YOU.

569
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,790
ME?

570
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,450
WHAT DID I DO?

571
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,100
WHERE DO WE STAND?

572
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,800
YOU AND ME?

573
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,320
BECAUSE YOU WERE
WILLING TO HAVE ME DO

574
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,980
ALL THE DIRTY WORK
TO FIND YOUR MOM,

575
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,500
BUT WHEN IT CAME
TO SHARING HOW YOU

576
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,940
ACTUALLY FELT ABOUT HER,

577
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,590
YOU WENT STRAIGHT
TO THE BATTEAM.

578
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,370
HANG ON.

579
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,070
YOU'RE TELLING ME...

580
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,950
THAT I HURT
YOUR FEELINGS?

581
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,730
I'M TELLING YOU
YOU DON'T KNOW ME

582
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,210
AT ALL.

583
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,960
YOU THINK YOU DO,
BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

584
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,220
OK. HEH.
CAPTIVE AUDIENCE HERE.

585
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,880
WHAT SHOULD I--
WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT?

586
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,100
BATWOMAN, DON'T
FALL ASLEEP ON ME.

587
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,840
BATWOMAN! RYAN!

588
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,540
RYAN, WAKE UP!

589
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,510
WOMAN: RAAH!

590
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,960
HEY. HEY.

591
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,440
I GOT YOU.
YOU'RE OK.

592
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,840
SOPHIE: BATWOMAN,
ARE YOU GOOD?

593
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,620
BATWING!

594
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,970
SOMEONE TALK TO ME!
CHECK IN!

595
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,890
UH, YEAH. SHE'S OK.
SHE'S OK. SHE'S CONSCIOUS.

596
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,370
I GOT HER.

597
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,120
SOPHIE, ON COMMS:
TRAFFIC CAMS FOUND US
TWO VEHICLES MATCHING

598
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,510
THE SUVs FROM ACE

599
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,640
NORTHBOUND ABOUT 6 MILES OUT.

600
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,080
GOT A GLIMPSE OF DEE
IN THE BACK.

601
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,910
SO SHE'S ALIVE.
THANK GOD.

602
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,390
-CLEVER.
-ME?

603
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,220
SOPHIE.

604
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,440
ME?

605
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,180
THE WAY YOU KEPT ME
FROM NODDING OFF
BACK THERE.

606
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,700
YOU'RE CLEVER,
WHICH MEANS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

607
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,180
THERE IS SOMETHING
I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU.

608
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,970
I WILL TAKE THAT
AS A THANK YOU.

609
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,540
ARE YOU FLIRTING
WITH SOPHIE RIGHT NOW?

610
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,450
WHAT? NO.

611
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,930
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

612
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,370
I KNOW WHAT FLIRTING IS.
WHAT WAS THAT?

613
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,070
I AM NOT FLIRTING
WITH SOPHIE.

614
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,770
GUYS...COMMS...ON.

615
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,680
OW.

616
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,510
THEY JUST TURNED
ONTO THE TRICORNER BRIDGE.

617
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,090
GOT THEM.

618
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,880
HOLD THIS.

619
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,050
WE'RE GOOD!
WE LOST THEM!

620
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,140
SOPHIE: NOT TO STATE
THE OBVIOUS,

621
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,190
BUT YOU DO SEE THAT IMPOSSIBLE
GAP IN THE BRIDGE, CORRECT?

622
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,450
I NEED A COPY ON THE CHUNK
OF BRIDGE MISSING

623
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,110
AT YOUR 12 O'CLOCK.

624
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,110
CONTROL FREAK.

625
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,720
ADD THAT TO
YOUR LIST, TOO.

626
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,600
BATWOMAN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

627
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,010
IT'S WORKING!

628
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,710
GUN IT NOW!

629
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,890
RYAN: WHOO OOH!

630
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,110
YEAH-EAH! WHOO!

631
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,680
THAT WAS BADASS.
YOU GOT TO ADMIT.

632
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,900
THAT WAS BADASS.

633
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,210
IT WAS INTERESTING.

634
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,820
INTERESTING?

635
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,170
WOMAN, YOU ARE
HARD TO PLEASE.

636
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,350
HURRY UP!
SHE'S GAINING!

637
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,540
GET OUT. GET OUT.

638
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,590
LET HER GO.

639
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,770
LET'S HOPE VICTOR
TOOK GOOD NOTES.

640
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,180
UGH!

641
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,670
UGH.

642
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,860
WHAT THE HELL IS
HAPPENING TO ME?

643
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,040
NOT MUCH LEFT,

644
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,220
BUT RENEE WAS WILLING
TO CROSS IT OFF HER LIST.

645
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,310
THANKS FOR HAVING
MY BACK BACK THERE.

646
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,880
GUESS IT'S SAFE TO SAY
YOU FIGURED OUT

647
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,310
THE GLITCHES
IN YOUR SUPERSUIT.

648
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,010
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

649
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,670
MARY: IT'S BECAUSE HE
DISABLED THE FAILSAFE.

650
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,100
HIS DAD DESIGNED THE SUIT TO
REACT TO LUKE'S PHYSIOLOGY.

651
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,060
A SURGE IN HEART RATE
SHUTS IT DOWN.

652
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,720
THAT SEEMS
COUNTERINTUITIVE.

653
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,330
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO WEAR IT

654
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,850
UNTIL HE'S READY.

655
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,940
MARY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

656
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,380
I SHOULDN'T HAVE CLEARED
YOU FOR FIELD DUTY.

657
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,070
I'M SORRY.

658
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,430
I PUT YOUR LIFE
AND THIS TEAM IN JEOPARDY.

659
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,210
YOU WANT TO WORRY
ABOUT THE TEAM?

660
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,690
WORRY ABOUT
THE PSYCHOPATH
WHO HELD NORA

661
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,470
AT KNIFEPOINT TODAY.

662
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,000
ALICE WAS HAVING
A TEMPER TANTRUM.

663
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,350
YOU WERE HAVING
A PHYSIOLOGICAL REACTION

664
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,130
TO STRESS.

665
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,310
LOOK. I'M THE TEAM DOCTOR.

666
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,400
I KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

667
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,490
I HEAR YOU, MARY,
AND THANK YOU,

668
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,580
BUT I WOULDN'T BE
STANDING HERE

669
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,670
IF BATWING HADN'T BEEN
WITH ME LAST NIGHT.

670
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,320
MARY: AND WHAT ABOUT
NEXT TIME?

671
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,710
THAT'S THE RISK
WE BOTH TAKE.

672
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,320
NO OFFENSE, RYAN,

673
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,940
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE PTSD
FROM BEING SHOT.

674
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,630
LUKE: I DON'T HAVE
PTSD.

675
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,330
OK. GIVE IT
TO ME STRAIGHT.

676
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,290
ARE YOU UP FOR THIS?

677
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,030
ABSOLUTELY.

678
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,990
OK. THEN KEEP
AN EYE ON IT,

679
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,820
BUT UNTIL WE GET
THESE WEAPONS OFF THE STREET,

680
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,610
I NEED LUKE BY MY SIDE.

681
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,780
I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

682
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,530
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

683
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,970
THANK YOU.

684
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,460
YOU DON'T SLEEP,
DO YOU?

685
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,950
HE KNOWS I'M
HIS SISTER.

686
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,860
-HOW?
-HE'S SMART AND AMBITIOUS

687
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,300
AND INCREDIBLY RECKLESS.

688
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:29,520
HE WANTS TO WORK TOGETHER
BEHIND JADA'S BACK.

689
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,660
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

690
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,530
IT'S FUNNY.
WHEN IT CAME TO FAMILY,

691
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:39,060
I NEVER ALLOWED MYSELF
TO ASK THAT QUESTION,

692
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,320
BUT THEN ALICE
RIPPED OFF THE BAND-AID.

693
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,450
UM...

694
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,060
IF I'M BEING REAL...

695
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,640
I WANT A MOM WHO KNOWS
ALL MY FOOD ALLERGIES

696
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,510
AND TELLS ME
MY SKIRT'S TOO SHORT

697
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,860
AND TEXTS MY GIRLFRIEND
ABOUT TV SHOWS THEY LIKE

698
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,080
AND LOVES ME...

699
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,480
UNCONDITIONALLY.

700
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,870
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
I WANT A MOM.

701
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,440
IT'S HER LOSS, RYAN.

702
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,750
YEAH. WELL, JADA IS
ONE OF THE MOST

703
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,580
CONNECTED PEOPLE
IN GOTHAM,

704
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,840
WHICH MEANS MAKING HER
MY ENEMY

705
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,760
PUTS EVERY ONE I CARE
ABOUT AT RISK.

706
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,200
SO AS TEMPTING AS IT IS
TO HAVE A BROTHER...

707
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,940
I GOT TO PUT
THE TEAM FIRST.

708
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,820
MARY: THERE'S
A BRONCHODILATOR TO HELP

709
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,300
WITH THE BREATHING
AND MEDS TO HELP
WITH THE PAIN.

710
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,180
IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH
TO MANAGE THE PAIN
THESE NEXT FEW DAYS.

711
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,700
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO RISK BEING OUT?

712
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,360
GCPD's PROBABLY OUT
HUNTING FOR US AS WE SPEAK.

713
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,050
BATWOMAN TOOK CARE OF IT.

714
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,230
NEITHER ONE OF YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

715
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,970
THANK YOU,
DR. HAMILTON.

716
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:20,420
VICTOR AND I HAD
OUR FIRST DATE IN THIS PARK.

717
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,420
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT TIRED?

718
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,810
WE CAN GO HOME.

719
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,080
DEE, I WANT TO BREATHE
IN THE FRESH AIR

720
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,950
WITH WHATEVER LUNGS
I HAVE LEFT,

721
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:36,260
AND THEN I WANT TO LET
IT ALL GO.

722
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,830
YOU'RE GIVING UP?

723
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,570
I'VE BEEN DYING
MY WHOLE LIFE, DEE.

724
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,350
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO STOP TIME,

725
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,050
THIS ONCE, WHAT DO YOU
SAY WE ENJOY

726
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,530
THE PRECIOUS MOMENTS
WE HAVE LEFT?

727
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,770
OHH! AAH!

728
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,670
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
