insisting on a meeting

ceo is."

arose in her absence.

the name on the letterhead.

Ok. Well,
if Jada jet

200
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:28,638

201
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:29,876
I'm gonna need to look the part.

Oh! Actually,
you are in luck,

203
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,600
because I just picked up

204

a ton of dry cleaning.

205

for just 5 minutes"?

216
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:14,336
No. It says,
"I'm a confident,

I need to know

to get through this unscathed?

insist on knowing about her?

00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,871
Well, as the resident expert

363
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,178
on predatory behavior,
I had some thoughts

364
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:06,182
on how Mr., uh, [rawr]
Chooses his prey.

365
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:10,360
I was thinking back
to my first kill,

366
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:11,927
for which I chose
a geriatric harpy

367
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,363
with an oxygen tank. Now,

368
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,930
do you know why I did that?

369
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,410
Because you're a killer, Alice.

370
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:20,370
No. Well, yes, but
that's not the takeaway.

371
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:24,157
I chose her because she was
easy pickings.

372
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,333
See, when a fledgling predator

373
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:27,812
is learning how
to stalk its prey,

374
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,814
it seeks to, um,

375
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,294
separate one from the herd.

376
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,210
So, he wouldn't have gone after

377
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:35,733
two victims for his first hunt.

378
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:40,086
Look at you learning
to think like a killer.

379
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,175
Which means the pool

380
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,351
wasn't this Croc's first attack.

381
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,743
And if it wasn't for
all the blood

382
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,136
in the deep end...

383
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,287
They would've just
been listed as

384
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:49,660
missing persons.

385
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,184
Just like
the missing persons I found

386
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:52,750
that were last seen

387
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:54,274
at the east river shore.

388
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:57,320
A mere two miles
from the pool attack.

389
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,105
Welcome to his hunting ground.

390
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,632
Girl: And with the team
trailing by one,

391
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:06,677
an incredible cross-field pass
from Megan rapinoe

392
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,331
to rookie sensation
Whitney hutchinson,

393
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,680
who fakes out the last defender,

394
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:12,248
and she's on breakaway...

395
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:13,467
And scores!

396
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,077
The crowd goes wild.

397
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:16,750
We're all tied up with
minutes left in the game.

398
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:17,882
Woman: Which the refs
are calling

399
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,168
on account of darkness.

400
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,430
Whitney: Mom!
Woman: Mm-mm.

401
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:21,581
Arguing with the ref
will get you

402
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:22,693
a yellow card.

403
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:25,044
Fine.

404
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,168
Gross.

405
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,012
Aah!

406
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,687
Sophie: According
to the 911 call,

407
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,326
you're right in the area where

408
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,651
the missing girl's mother
said she was playing.

409
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,416
Gcpd's en route.

410
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,375
Well, they'll find

411
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:36,941
about as much as we have,

412
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,421
which isn't much.

413
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,119
There has to be some sign
of her there.

414
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,035
Batwoman: Drag marks lead off
in that direction.

415
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,950
But there's no
body parts, no blood.

416
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:47,387
He didn't feed on her here.

417
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,258
Which is understandable,
given he did just

418
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:51,042
feast on all-you-can-eat coeds.

419
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:54,176
There's a whole lot of
secretion, Sophie.

420
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,830
Didn't you say O.G.
Killer Croc's Saliva

421
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,527
contained a paralytic agent?

422
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,355
That's how he
subdued his victims.

423
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,270
And then stash them
away for later.

424
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:03,881
It's basically like
a Croc-pantry,

425
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,405
for when he wants a doggy-bag.

426
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,034
Ok, then we need to find
where he stashed her,

427
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:08,578
because that girl
could still be alive.

428
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:11,759
Yeah.

429
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,284
Until he gets hungry.

430
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:19,506
Is that Croc skin?

431
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:23,162
It appears our Croc is a...
Growing boy.

432
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:34,434
Whitney: Aah!
[Splash]

433
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,523
[Gasping for air]

434
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,147
Aah! Oh! [Crying]

435
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,338
[Growling]

436
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:24,571
Alice: So, what was
she like? Mommy.

437
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,225
She was amazing.

438
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,965
And then you took her from me.

439
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,924
I meant birth mommy.

440
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:32,535
But if it'll break the ice,

441
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,058
I'll tell you about my mom.

442
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,688
She had a really great
head on her shoulders.

443
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:37,148
Emphasis on
the word "had."

444
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,411
Why do you care?

445
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,151
Why do you keep
pretending not to?

446
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:41,303
Surely you grew up wondering

447
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:42,937
what she was like, and

448
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,200
seeing as fate,
otherwise known as me,

449
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,028
has brought you together,
I think I at least

450
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:49,291
deserve to know that
my efforts have paid off.

451
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:52,599
You want to know
what Jada was like?

452
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,818
She was amazing.

453
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:57,125
She was confident, direct,

454
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,431
fearless, unapologetic.

455
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,041
She was a freaking masterclass

456
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:01,260
in taking what's hers.

457
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,523
And letting it go, apparently.

458
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:04,804
Did it hurt all the more knowing

459
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:07,353
she didn't want you in her life?

460
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:10,921
No. Because I don't
want her in mine.

461
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,575
She doesn't even know who I am,

462
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,969
but I know who she is
and I don't need her.

463
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:17,232
Now shut up and help
me find the trail.

464
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:21,758
Actually... i think we just
found where it ends.

465
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:33,030
[Grate clattering]

466
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,559
You first.

467
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,518
Me? The one who's

468
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,390
not wearing impenetrable
tactical armor?

469
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,348
That's who you want
taking point?

470
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,307
I'm not letting you
out of my sight, Alice.

471
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,179
Do you really think
I'm gonna run?

472
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:52,876
Do you really think
I'm going to believe

473
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,922
that you give a damn
about stopping this Croc?

474
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,358
Yes. I think
you're gonna run

475
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:57,751
the first chance you get.

476
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:58,839
So, it's my job not to

477
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,362
give you any chances.

478
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,731
Oh, that's funny.
I thought it was your job

479
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,409
to save a little girl.

480
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:04,714
Don't act like you're here

481
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:06,194
to do the good deed, Alice.

482
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:07,389
You only think about yourself,

483
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:08,588
so, don't you dare use

484
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:09,589
that little girl as camouflage.

485
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:12,505
I was that little girl.

486
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,115
Don't act like
you're the only one

487
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:15,334
with abandonment issues.

488
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,639
I will not give up on this girl

489
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:19,338
the way everyone gave up on me.

490
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:37,268
Ucch! That smell.

491
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,357
Rotting meat.

492
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,664
Kinda takes me back
to my childhood.

493
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,492
What the hell is this?

494
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:47,366
Bait.

495
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:52,651
This means we're
not the only one

496
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:53,894
hunting this monster.

497
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,679
Man: He's not a monster.

498
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:02,685
He's my son.

499
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:09,344
This feels a bit unnecessary.

500
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,389
I'm fine.

501
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:15,394
Well, you're keeping fit.

502
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:19,833
In... my official,
professional

504
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:27,710
Let's take a look
at your heart rate.

505

[Monitor beeping]

506
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:34,238
It looks good.

507
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:35,849
Let's have a listen
to your lungs.

508
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,075
Good breath sounds.

509
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:53,301
Mm. Your heart rate
is rising.

Still rising.[Monitor beeping faster]

513
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:05,922
Now it's racing.

514
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,358
Luke, are you ok?

515
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,494
I... i... yeah, yeah.

516
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,801
I... I'm just... I'm ticklish

517
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,629
and your hands are cold.

518
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,239
Yeah. Yeah.

519
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,676
You're right. I...

520
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:23,592
You're totally fine.

521
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:29,816
Totally... you're totally
feeling fine.

522
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,821
You can put your shirt back on.

523
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:36,083
Yeah. Ok.

524
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,214
If you want.

525
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:40,261
You should.

526
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:44,744
Uh... yeah.
So, like I said,

527
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:47,573
it's just a problem
with the suit.

528
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:51,228
Ahh. Yeah.
Must be.

529
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:55,145
You think you can fix it?

530
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:56,712
Yeah. Yeah.
It should be easy.

531
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:59,062
I just need to
override the failsafe.

532
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:04,285
Are you sure that
that's a good idea?

533
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:06,200
I mean, isn't the point
of a failsafe

534
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:07,683
to keep you safe
when the suit fails?

535
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:09,333
What if it's just
trying to protect you?

536
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:11,553
I think it's being
a little overprotective.

537
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,599
Kind of reminds me of a certain

538
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,252
newly minted doctor that I know.

to hurt those people.

542
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:24,914
I'm sure he didn't.

543
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:27,003
He's not a killer.

544
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,178
Unlike that one.

545
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:32,922
I wasn't expecting to
find anybody down here,

546
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:34,576
much less a pair of celebrities.

547
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,467
What the hell are you two
doing together, anyway?

548
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:38,537
Aren't y'all supposed
to be enemies?

549
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,017
Long story.
She's working with me.

550
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:42,255
They're a little short-staffed

551
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,629
at City Hall.
That's why.

552
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,108
We want to help your son.

553
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:46,172
Why don't you start
by telling us

554
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:47,241
what happened to him?

555
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,028
It's probably better I show you.

556
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,424
[Sigh] Just before Steven

557
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,947
was heading off to college,

558
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,775
we went on a father-son
fishing trip.

559
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:03,083
He hooked a bluegill
on his very first cast.

560
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:04,954
But when we cut that thing open,

561
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:07,000
there was something
mighty weird inside.

562
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:08,479
Batwoman: Let me guess.

563
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:11,265
A rather large crocodile tooth?

564
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:14,355
Yeah. Steven thought
it would be cool

565
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,531
to make it into a necklace.

566
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:19,795
But he cut himself on the tooth.

567
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:22,102
Cut got infected.

568
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:25,932
Then Steven... Started changing.

569
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:30,284
[Sigh] Tried doctors.

570
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:31,938
None of them knew what it was.

571
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:33,592
They couldn't stop the changes.

572
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,638
Every day, there was
a little less Steven

573
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:40,381
and a little more... Creature.

574
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:44,603
And that's when the
appetite took hold of him.

575
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:48,824
And I had to chain him up.
But he was just too strong.

576
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:51,392
Too hungry.
He broke free.

577
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,235
I've been trying
to lure him back.

578
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:57,741
Alice: You really rolled out
the red carpet for him.

579
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,576
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

580
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,491
But we really do want
to help your son,

581
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,319
and we have to start
by making sure

582
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:07,800
he doesn't hurt that little girl
or anyone else.

583
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,299
Alice: Yeah, but I just
don't think he's gonna

584
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:10,803
agree to being locked up again.

585
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:16,939
That's where this comes in.
[Electricity crackling]

586
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:19,594
You think that thing's
strong enough for him?

587
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,337
Yeah. But it's not for him.

588
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,860
It's for you.

589
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:25,948
Aah!

590
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,085
I'm not gonna let you
hurt my boy.

591
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:36,045
[Electricity crackling]
Aah! Oh!

592
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,680
Batwoman, I'm reading
a huge power spike.

593
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:43,792
Is everything ok?

594
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,187
Batwoman, do you read me?

595
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:50,364
Batwoman!

596
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:53,802
[Groaning]

597
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:56,544
Man: I'm sorry.
I really am.

598
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:57,893
But my boy's suffered enough

599
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:59,721
without you adding to it.

600
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:01,767
[Groaning]

601
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:07,555
I just want to get him
the help he needs.

602
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:09,383
Man: Yeah. Your idea
of helping Stevie

603
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:10,819
is taking him away from me.

604
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:13,517
Locking him in a cage, or worse.

605
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:15,041
Jab him with needles.

606
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:16,583
Dissect him like he's
some kind of lab animal.

Man: I'm his father

610
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,836
and I'm gonna do
whatever I need to do

611
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,533
to keep him safe.

612
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,710
Even if that means...

00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,755
[growling]

614
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:41,850

Stevie, noooo!

No! [Screaming]

[Groaning]

619
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:56,299
Are you ok?

620
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:59,433
Yeah. I just
need a minute.

621
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:00,651
Oh, that's good.

622
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:01,783
'Cause that's all I need.

[Electricity crackling]

624
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:07,789
Suckas.

625
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,511
One minute I had her and then

626
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:15,710
everything went dead.

627
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,711
I've been trying to raise her

628
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,104
but I can't even...

629
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:19,801
[static]
Batwoman: Batcave. Come in.

630
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,977
Batwoman, we read you.
What happened?

631
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,892
Exactly what I said
would happen.

632
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:27,940
Alice escaped.
And I can't hunt her down

633
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:29,637
and save a little girl.

634
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,354
Batwing, you ready to
get back to the field?

635
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:33,162
Yeah. I'm good to go.

636
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:35,246
So, you and Mary fixed
what was wrong with the suit.

637
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:42,084
Um... yes.
Batwing is all clear.

638
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:45,435
Batwoman: Good.
Alice was last headed

639
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:48,395
north through the sewer tunnels.

640
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,590
Sophie: If she's on foot,
she's gonna wanna change that.

641
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,834
There's a truck depot a few
miles on that trajectory.

642
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,183
That's where I'd head.

643
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:55,837
I hope you're right.

644
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,056
We need to find Alice

645
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,971
before Renee knows she's gone.

646
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:06,805
Whitney: Help! Somebody!

647
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:10,330
Please, please.

648
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:24,866
Oh, thank god.

649
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,148
I thought that thing
was gonna come back.

650
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:27,452
And he probably will do so, hon.

651
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:29,436
Up and at 'em.
We gotta skedaddle.

652
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:30,654
I can't walk.

653
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:32,482
You're gonna have to try.

654
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:34,920
But my leg is broken.

Alice: ...Hey, hon.

657
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:41,317
I'm on a really tight
schedule here, so,

658
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:42,860
you and I three-legged
racing outta here

659
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:46,061
is really gonna slow me down.

660
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:48,020
No, no.
You have to help me.

661
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,109
[Panting]

662
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:01,511
Fine. I'm gonna help you.

663
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,099
By teaching you the lesson that

664
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,341
I had to learn the hard way.

665
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:10,390
No one is gonna
save you except yourself.

666
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:13,741
You are the only one
you can count on.

667
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:18,224
The sooner you learn that,

668
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,052
the better off you'll be.

669
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:21,401
No.

670
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,013
You're gonna thank me
for this one day.

671
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:31,063
[Crying] No! No!
Help me, please!

672
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:34,022
Don't leave me...
Don't leave me, please!

Batwoman: I know
you're out there, Steven,

675
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,464
and I know you can hear me.

676
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:42,944
There is still some of you

677
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,338
left in there that
can understand me.

678
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,688
Ok? I do not want to hurt you.

679
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:48,950
I just want to help you.

680
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:52,562
And your father, he just
wants to help you, too.

681
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:55,957
He really loves you.

682
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:59,700
And trust me... you are
really lucky

683
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:01,006
to have a parent like that.

684
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,272
Someone that would do
anything to protect you.

685
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:13,583
And never give up on you.
No matter what.

686
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,893
[Sigh] So much for

687
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,242
trying to reason with you.

Alice's tracking monitor.

691
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:38,608
Define "lost."

692
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:39,609
One moment it's reading
loud and clear.

693
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,089
The next, nothing.

694
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,048
It doesn't make sense.
No one's ever managed

695
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:44,286
to circumvent
one of those things.

696
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,486
Tell that to Alice.

697
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:48,053
This means she could
be anywhere.

Any problems?

you could beat me?

Why would I need to beat you?

to happen?

It already has.
