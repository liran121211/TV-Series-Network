1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,100
Last season on Batwoman...

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,168
New look.

3
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:10,502
New Batwoman.

4
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:11,508
What is this place?

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,635
It was where Bruce kept the weapons

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,840
he confiscated from all
the villains he took down.

7
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:18,140
When I was a kid, I drew pictures

8
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:20,675
of how I imagined
a Black Batman would look.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,844
Turns out my dad was secretly turning

10
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:25,380
those pictures into reality.

11
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,615
Your mother didn't die
in childbirth, Ry-Ry.

12
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,086
Mommy dearest...
is still very much alive.

13
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,787
So what's next, Batwoman?

14
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:34,989
We're gonna find that
case of Batman trophies

15
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,828
before anyone else does.

16
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:03,952
_

17
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:06,154
It didn't take long
for the psychiatric unit

18
00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:08,222
at Gotham University hospital to make

19
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:09,824
the recommendation to the courts.

20
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:12,960
Wonderland Gang leader Alice,
AKA the missing

21
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:15,696
and presumed dead Beth Kane,
will not stand trial

22
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,631
but instead will continue her residency

23
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:20,200
at Arkham Asylum
for the criminally insane.

24
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:51,897
Curiouser and curiouser.

25
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:54,200
I will show them

26
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:56,903
exactly how wrong they are about you,

27
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,806
and I will have so much fun doing it.

28
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:03,009
Heh.

29
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:06,011
Just as you would want,
my dear, sweet Alice.

31
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,433
- Raah!
- Unh!

32
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:30,436
Where were we? Oh, yeah. Sidekick names.

33
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,280
Just FYI, no sidekick actually likes

34
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,148
being referred to as a sidekick.

35
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,517
Copy that, my number two dude.

36
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:47,186
Nope, not that either.

37
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,401
"All the more reason
for me to find a way

38
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:05,403
to get you out of there".

39
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,043
"I promise you I'm not
giving up on you this time.

40
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:13,611
More to come"...

41
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:17,448
"Your father".

42
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,831
Kane... Visitor.

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,664
So I have an idea for a name.

44
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:42,700
Just please don't say Black Batman.

45
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:44,602
Seriously? Black Batman?

46
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:48,006
Coming from the girl
who inherited her code name.

47
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:49,941
You know what? I got one.

48
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,976
The Dork Knight. Ha!

49
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,878
Just look for the damn Poison Ivy.

50
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:56,113
Hey. Are you sure they shipped it here?

51
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:57,882
Believe it or not,
Poison Ivy doesn't get

52
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,751
a lot of action on the dark web,

53
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:02,053
so I got creative, honed in on people

54
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:03,622
who could actually
benefit from a mystical,

55
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:05,557
fast-growing vine, found these guys

56
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:08,359
looking for a way to expand
their marijuana crop.

57
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:10,728
The shipment was supposed
to come in today.

58
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,896
Of all the artifacts
that fell into the river,

59
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:16,369
a Poison Ivy sprig doesn't
exactly scream moneymaker.

60
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:19,606
Bingo.

61
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,841
Hey. Is it just me,
or has this quadrupled

62
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,846
since Circe took it?

63
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,082
Someone just probably got it wet.

64
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:27,950
Keep it away from the light.

65
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:41,625
_

66
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:55,105
Aah!

67
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:00,813
Hey! You copy?

68
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:06,281
What the hell was that?

69
00:05:13,628 --> 00:05:16,726
So, what, we're, uh, sisters now?

70
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:18,628
Far from it.

71
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,895
I graduate med school tomorrow,

72
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,299
and Dad's one wish was
for me to check on you

73
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:26,568
and keep you from going
off the deep end,

74
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,271
so this is me pretending to care

75
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:31,105
so I don't have to lie
to him when he calls me

76
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,443
tomorrow to congratulate me.

77
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:37,146
That is so sweet...

78
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,048
- Mmm.
- But I'm good.

79
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,151
I can smell you through this partition,

80
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:44,553
so I beg to differ.

81
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:47,156
See, that's the thing.

82
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:50,725
None of this matters

83
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,227
because Daddy's gonna find a way

84
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:53,461
to get me out of here.

85
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:56,393
Really? From the top bunk of his cell

86
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,398
in Metropolis?

87
00:05:57,403 --> 00:05:59,100
Even incarcerated, Daddy's one

88
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:01,469
of the most connected men
in Gotham City.

89
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:04,639
What makes you believe that?

90
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:07,575
Oh, he didn't tell you?

91
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,911
Yeah. We've been, um, writing,

92
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,747
so I know you came to make
sure that I was miserable,

93
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:17,288
but I'm sorry to inform you I'm not.

94
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,456
Fine. Then this is me punching in

95
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,592
and promptly punching out.

96
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:26,163
See you, Alice.

97
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:43,009
One quick question while I have you.

98
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:46,182
It's about your little pal Ryan.

99
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:54,887
4 down, how many still out there?

100
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:57,224
A lot.

101
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:58,592
But at least in the meantime,

102
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:00,827
we prevented Gotham from
a cortisone shortage.

103
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,994
So you want to tell me
why you froze up back there?

104
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,930
I didn't freeze up. The suit did.

105
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,398
It just glitches out sometimes.

106
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:07,935
Because I can't be watching
both of our asses.

107
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:10,237
Yeah, I know that, and I'll fix it.

108
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:12,872
Graduation tickets. I go on at 7:00,

109
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:15,274
which means your butt
needs to be in your seat

110
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,008
at 6:30 sharp!

111
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:19,210
So if there's a bomber
threatening to take out

112
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:20,613
half the city, just remember that

113
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:22,481
I only become an official MD once,

114
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:24,816
and people bomb Gotham every other day.

115
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:27,386
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go

116
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:29,355
shower off my encounter with Alice.

117
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,890
Apparently, she and my dad
are pen pals now.

118
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:34,426
That's... uncomfortable.

119
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:37,228
I've barely even heard from
him since he was put away,

120
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:39,597
but sure, reconnect with the chick

121
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:40,832
who killed your second wife.

122
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,135
I'll just be graduating tomorrow.

123
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,904
You know, valedictorian,
top of my class,

124
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,807
but as long as Alice knows
that you're thinking of her...

125
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:50,508
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

126
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,710
I know your family
can't be there tomorrow,

127
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:55,180
but this family can,
and we won't miss it.

128
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:58,683
Yeah. Oh. That reminds me.

129
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:01,552
Alice told me to ask you
about your birth mom.

130
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:03,388
- Huh?
- She was like,

131
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:05,290
"Ryan will know what I mean",

132
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:08,493
and then she smiled like a total creep.

133
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:10,961
Your mom died in childbirth.

134
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:13,397
That's dark even for Alice.

135
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:18,102
So you don't know
what she's referring to?

136
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:21,872
Since when does Alice ever make sense?

137
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,808
I can relate to Alice
on a deeply personal level,

138
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:28,045
which is why I am here
at her last known hideout,

139
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,580
where society shoved her
back into the sewers.

140
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:33,683
At the tender age of 13,
she was lost, forgotten,

141
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:35,419
held captive, tortured!

142
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,387
Who wouldn't break under all that?

143
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,157
Locking her away in Arkham
is just victimizing her

144
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:41,826
all over again!

145
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,762
You know you drank too much

146
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:47,164
when you're seeing leprechauns.

147
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:51,368
Free Alice? That woman
is a full-blown lunatic.

148
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:53,269
Alice is a survivor.

149
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:55,074
Pay her some respect.

150
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,175
Alice is just another victim

151
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,678
of a flawed bureaucratic system.

152
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:03,280
She deserves her day in court.

153
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,782
Dude, why did... why did you say that?

154
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:08,051
Heh. Heh heh.

155
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:11,555
No idea why I just said that. Ha ha ha!

156
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,791
Yeah. What the hell was that?

157
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:16,359
What's happening with your hat, huh?

158
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:17,829
Let go of me!

159
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,166
Curiouser and curiouser.

160
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,534
What the hell's going on?

161
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,636
Uh, let's just get out of here, dude.

162
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,338
Stand still.

163
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,340
Why can't I move?

164
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:32,741
Kill him.

165
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:35,513
I'm not killing my friend, freak.

166
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:43,919
Dude, what are you doing?

167
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:45,187
No, no. What are you doing?

168
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:46,421
What are you doing? Aah!

169
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:50,125
What the hell was that?

170
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,861
What did you make me do, you psycho?

171
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:56,031
You're a fricking psycho!

172
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:59,203
Mad as a hatter. Ha ha ha!

173
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,200
_

174
00:10:14,318 --> 00:10:17,049
Yo. Hey. I have something for you.

175
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:18,984
I'm sleeping. Go away.

176
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:21,056
I think you're gonna want to see this.

177
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:33,899
Isn't that the Batman guy,
the Mad Hatter?

178
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:35,704
I remember him from when I was a kid.

179
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,709
_

180
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,075
Move.

181
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:47,412
I swear I would... I would
never kill anyone.

182
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,947
It was like one second
I'm... I'm laughing

183
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:52,046
at some... some loser dressed up,

184
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,751
and the next thing I know, I'm...

185
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:57,121
slicing open my buddy's throat.

186
00:10:57,126 --> 00:11:00,425
It was completely out of my control.

187
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,627
What makes you think
it was the Mad Hatter?

188
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:05,229
Oh, Montoya. Last I checked,

189
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:06,764
you traded that big, shiny pin

190
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,967
for a basement desk in the City Hall.

191
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:11,269
What's it again, freak squad?

192
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:12,639
The Rogues Unit.

193
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,410
Was he short, old, what?

194
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:21,778
Nah. Younger.

195
00:11:21,783 --> 00:11:25,983
Lanky, dork-like.

196
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:27,717
He's a Mad Hatter imposter,

197
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:30,354
which means he found the hat.

198
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,055
No, no. What are you doing?

199
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,424
No! No, no, no!

200
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:39,696
What... what the hell did you just do?

201
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,399
I don't know what's
more disturbing... that,

202
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:44,101
that he posted it, or that Alice

203
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:45,535
actually has a fanboy.

204
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,804
Sorry. How does a top hat make someone

205
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,239
kill their drinking buddy?

206
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:52,476
Right. Meet Jervis Tetch,

207
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:55,512
AKA the original Mad Hatter.

208
00:11:55,517 --> 00:11:56,913
Now according to my dad,

209
00:11:56,918 --> 00:11:59,215
Jervis Tetch was a tiny, insecure,

210
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,884
and annoying neuroscientist.

211
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,653
He felt like the world
wasn't listening to him,

212
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,587
so he developed mind control technology

213
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:06,288
to force them to listen.

214
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,190
He built it directly into his hat.

215
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,726
Okay. This says Bruce had
the hat deprogrammed

216
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,096
before he put it into the trophy case.

217
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,130
My guess is that the technology latches

218
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,533
to the brain activity of the
first person who puts it on.

219
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:18,868
If the hat is technology, can't we

220
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:20,703
hack it or whatever?

221
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,839
It's not exactly uploaded to the cloud.

222
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:24,674
We first need to get
the hat off his head.

223
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,543
Well, how without falling
victim to it in the process?

224
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,746
128 hertz of frequency.

225
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:32,380
Your dad figured out how to disrupt

226
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,082
the hat's radio waves.

227
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,484
Okay. So we know the how and the what.

228
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,886
We just need to know the where.

229
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,855
So if I were an Alice-obsessed

230
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,028
Mad Hatter wannabe, where would I go?

231
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:47,095
I was wondering when
you'd come crawling back.

232
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,665
You stormed out of here
in such a... huff last time,

233
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,500
I was worried it was something I said.

234
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:56,838
Tell me what you're planning
with your Mad Hatter superfan.

235
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:00,408
I told you I don't know him.

236
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,612
Well, he certainly knows
a lot about you.

237
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,479
Have you watched the news?

238
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,147
My identity's been outed,

239
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:09,249
and some people actually appreciate

240
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:11,818
that I'm just a girl standing in front

241
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,687
of a psychiatric ward,
asking them not to

242
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,022
fry her brain.

243
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,924
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, come on.

244
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,461
We both know I'm utterly
helpless behind these walls.

245
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:25,132
You came because you want
all the dirty deets on Mommy D.

246
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,736
I saw my birth mother's
death certificate.

247
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:33,340
Nia A. Wilder. died the day I was born.

248
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,943
If you say so, dear.

249
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,445
What is this? Hmm?

250
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,348
Are you lonely?
You need to keep somebody

251
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:44,050
on a leash to stop you from slipping

252
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,418
into total isolation?

253
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:47,721
Heh heh heh.

254
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,123
Am I lonely?

255
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:51,992
Look at your life.

256
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,760
Your closest emotional connection

257
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,862
is an ex in witness protection.

258
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:58,031
You have no one.

259
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:00,200
I gave you someone to fill the hole

260
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:03,036
in your little, empty heart.

261
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,138
I have my friends.

262
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:07,140
Luke and Mary?

263
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:09,308
Right. Who you're so close to

264
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:10,745
you couldn't even tell your birth mother

265
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,314
lied to you all these years.

266
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:16,581
- We're done here.
- Sounds like your Mad Hatter's

267
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:18,653
planning a tea party.

268
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:24,923
Do you know what he's planning, Alice?

269
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,961
I just know what I would do.

270
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,866
Which is?

271
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:35,333
It would be so refreshing

272
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:37,169
if a supervillain actually said

273
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:39,304
what they meant for once.

274
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:40,506
What tea party?

275
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:41,974
Not to kill the mood,

276
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:43,776
but the last tea party Alice had,

277
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:45,443
she poisoned your mom.

278
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:49,181
So what, he's making
it personal, more public?

279
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:51,315
You know what? I should ask my dad.

280
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,518
Maybe he's chatted about it with Alice

281
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:55,287
in their correspondence.

282
00:14:55,292 --> 00:15:00,258
Okay. You, my dear, are graduating

283
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,194
top of your class,

284
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,829
looking fine as hell might I add,

285
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:08,300
and we are standing
here talking about Alice.

286
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:10,334
Can we not let that bitch
ruin the best thing

287
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,370
we have going on right now, please?

288
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,806
Fine. Subject change.

289
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:17,342
Who's this Deja girl you ditched
me for last night, hmm?

290
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:18,776
I thought her name was Riley.

291
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:20,712
Oh, no. Riley was last week.

292
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:22,947
Um, excuse me. I'm allowed to date

293
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:24,281
multiple women at once.

294
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:27,085
So I take it you and Kate
are not happening?

295
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,187
Oh, no. They're good.

296
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:32,156
They're friends,
but it's too complicated

297
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:33,457
for anything more right now.

298
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:38,162
Thank you, Mary. Yes to all of that.

299
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:41,399
Ryan Wilder, I think
this is the most interest

300
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:43,567
you've ever shown my love life.

301
00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:45,669
At least somebody's getting
some around here.

302
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:49,841
You know, the more I think
about this tea party thing,

303
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:52,709
if there's one person who can predict

304
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:54,511
a lunatic's next move, it's another

305
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:56,179
certifiable lunatic.

306
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:57,448
That's what I can't shake.

307
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:58,915
She has no reason to make this up.

308
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,917
She has every reason...

309
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:02,886
because this is all a game to her.

310
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:04,588
She's trying to feel relevant because

311
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:06,290
she doesn't matter anymore.

312
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:09,460
Now seriously, drop it
before y'all both kill my buzz.

313
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:13,465
Y'all know this wasn't a cheap-ass
bottle of champagne.

314
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:15,799
I'm gonna go check on her.

315
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:17,570
I should go practice my speech.

316
00:16:20,642 --> 00:16:22,582
Want to tell me what happened at Arkham?

317
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:28,945
Nothing because Alice was unhelpful

318
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,480
and petulant and everything

319
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:32,415
one would expect Alice to be.

320
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,484
Then if she was everything you expected,

321
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:36,656
how'd she get under your skin?

322
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:40,126
Ryan, what happened?

323
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:48,231
She said my biological mother,

324
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:51,033
who died giving birth to me,

325
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:52,902
was actually still alive

326
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:55,004
and that she covered it
all up with a fake name

327
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,706
so I'd never find her.

328
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:00,609
- Damn.
- And as much as I don't believe

329
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:01,844
a word Alice says...

330
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:03,712
There's still a part
of you that can't help

331
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:07,016
but wonder "Is my mom still alive?"

332
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:09,985
I take it Mary and Luke don't know.

333
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,387
I don't know if I want to know.

334
00:17:12,392 --> 00:17:14,723
I was told my whole life that my dad

335
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:18,393
was out of the picture and
my mom died in the hospital.

336
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:20,595
What if I have a family out there?

337
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,869
Want me to look into it on the DL?

338
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,705
Thank you.

339
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:36,477
Testing 1, 2, 3.

340
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:38,446
Hey. You're not supposed to be up here.

341
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:41,382
I got a guy matching the
top hat loony from the news.

342
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:43,017
I'm just testing the microphone,

343
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:44,853
making sure that my voice projects

344
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,955
all the way to the back.

345
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,190
Perfect. You're all here.

346
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:50,791
Gather around, friends.

347
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:52,997
It's a lovely afternoon...

348
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:56,968
for tea.

349
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:00,690
Gotham City Vital Records.

350
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:03,995
Hi. I was hoping you could
e-mail me a birth certificate.

351
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,598
Mail only. 4-6 weeks.

352
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:09,567
Okay. Thanks anyway.

353
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,135
I'll just hack into your system

354
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,807
and find it myself.

355
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:17,975
Let's see. Who was
the attending physician?

356
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,880
Dr. Quadracci.

357
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:28,054
Shady doctor. Here we go.

358
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,130
Mayor Hartley.

359
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:41,665
See this sandwich, Montoya?

360
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,266
I haven't eaten since 9:30.

361
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:44,901
The Mad Hatter's a copycat.

362
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,335
I think he's somehow gotten ahold

363
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,268
of the original hat,
which doesn't make sense

364
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:49,674
because Batman took it off the streets

365
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,241
and locked it down 20 years ago.

366
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:53,643
Am I special, or did you
torture Mayor Akins, too?

367
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:55,811
He hired me, ma'am,
to run the Rogues Unit.

368
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:57,613
I convinced him it's
only a matter of time

369
00:18:57,618 --> 00:19:00,082
before Batman's enemies come
crawling out of the sewer

370
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:02,919
looking for their toys, and here we are.

371
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,620
And it's not just the Mad Hatter's hat.

372
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,625
Of course it's not.

373
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,092
Apparently, a cutting of Poison Ivy

374
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:08,494
was bouncing around the dark web

375
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:09,895
for the past 3 days.

376
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,699
If someone's leaking
these back onto the streets,

377
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:13,200
I need to see what else is out there.

378
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:16,165
Look. I am 30 days
into this whole Mayor gig,

379
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,201
and I am not putting the
words "rogues" or "toys"

380
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:20,302
onto my budget.

381
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:22,304
What about the words "mass casualty"

382
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:25,441
and "preventable" on
your resignation letter?

383
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:28,811
Mayor, I love this city in my bones,

384
00:19:28,816 --> 00:19:31,245
and I need you to hear
me before this becomes

385
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,052
Jim Gordon's Gotham all over again.

386
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:54,772
It's a two-drink limit, so sip slowly.

387
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:01,676
Okay. What?

388
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,579
Alice was right.

389
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:06,147
Nia A. Wilder doesn't exist.

390
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:07,416
I saw her death certificate.

391
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,450
The doctor who signed
her death certificate

392
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:12,120
also signed your birth certificate.

393
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,555
Two months later, he lost his license

394
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,090
for an unrelated wire fraud,

395
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:17,659
so I honed in on him.

396
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:19,727
He had 25 patients in the days

397
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:21,395
surrounding your birth.

398
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,764
I looked into all of them,

399
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:24,332
and one came into the hospital

400
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:26,267
a day before you were born,

401
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:27,636
according to her medical files,

402
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:29,804
she was suffering
from a cyst on her ovary,

403
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:32,107
so I followed the money.

404
00:20:32,112 --> 00:20:33,975
She paid him $2 million

405
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,878
after her so-called emergency surgery.

406
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:42,250
$2 million to cover up her
pregnancy with me? Why?

407
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:45,319
I have no idea,

408
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:48,856
but your mom's still alive, Ryan.

409
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:51,292
And my dad?

410
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:54,031
Nothing. Just her.

411
00:20:57,336 --> 00:20:59,033
Here.

412
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,702
If you want to know her name,

413
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:04,475
and if you don't, I get that, too.

414
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:07,911
Two-drink limit?

415
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:13,314
What are we talking about?

416
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,018
Let's find our seats.

417
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:26,560
Okay. Smile.

418
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:28,829
Okay. Say, "Cheese!" Ha ha!

419
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,564
Aah!

420
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:33,233
Ready for your big speech?

421
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:37,705
Dr. Hall, sorry. I was
just having a moment.

422
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,574
I'm sure your family would be proud.

423
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,109
They'd better be.

424
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:43,543
You're one of the best students

425
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:45,211
that's ever come through this school.

426
00:21:45,216 --> 00:21:47,016
Thank you, Dr. Hall.

427
00:21:57,762 --> 00:21:59,558
Dr. Hamilton,

428
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:02,899
you are the spitting
image of your mother.

429
00:22:16,114 --> 00:22:17,779
Do no harm.

430
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:22,951
Today, we take the hippocratic oath...

431
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:31,890
But shouldn't it be called
the hypocrite oath?

432
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:37,328
I mean, doctors are supposed to uphold

433
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,532
the highest ethical
medical standards, right?

434
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:44,503
Instead, it's "How many patients
can I see in a day?

435
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:47,239
And "Sorry. We don't
take that insurance"

436
00:22:47,244 --> 00:22:51,710
and "That bandage costs $300".

437
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:56,248
What happened to the Gotham
medical community?

438
00:22:58,054 --> 00:23:00,718
- Did she change her speech?
- This is not her speech.

439
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:03,554
Don't even get me started

440
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:06,357
on mental health care.

441
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:11,329
Do you know the process
of institutionalizing someone?

442
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:13,799
It took our Alma mater Gotham U

443
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:17,272
under the oversight
of our chair Dr. Hall...

444
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:22,007
a measly 10 minutes to decide

445
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:26,444
that Alice would be an Arkham lifer.

446
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:30,114
So what, we just give up on her?

447
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:32,750
This is not Mary talking.

448
00:23:32,755 --> 00:23:35,820
He got to her. He's here.

449
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:37,888
What about the fact that
she was victimized

450
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:39,524
for over a decade,

451
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:42,960
that her own family gave up on her,

452
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,898
that she was replaced...

453
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:49,033
by me?

454
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:51,402
This is what Alice meant.

455
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:53,404
This is his tea party.

456
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:55,306
If you have ear buds, put them on.

457
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:58,108
I'm texting you a disruptor frequency
to block his mind control.

458
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:10,721
No!

459
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:16,893
Everybody shut up

460
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:20,600
and take your seats until
I instruct you otherwise.

461
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:26,035
The show is about to begin.

462
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,908
Now if you are going
to wield the power of a god,

463
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:34,143
prove you are worthy.

464
00:24:34,148 --> 00:24:38,647
Remove this man's organs one at a time

465
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:40,185
until he dies.

466
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,520
You need help.

467
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,389
You sound like all my doctors.

468
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:48,257
Okay. We need to take him out.

469
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:50,058
No, no. We can't do that.

470
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,827
He's already brain-jacked everyone here.

471
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:53,931
We need to get him to reverse
it before Mary kills that guy.

472
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:55,631
How? Ask nicely?

473
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:57,767
There is one person he'll listen to.

474
00:24:57,772 --> 00:24:59,435
- No.
- Ryan,

475
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,770
Mary's about to de-organ
the chair of her university.

476
00:25:01,775 --> 00:25:02,805
Absolutely not.

477
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,710
Okay. What am I missing?

478
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:10,144
We can get Liam to
undo the mind control,

479
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:13,250
but we have to break
Alice out of Arkham first.

480
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,800
It may have taken him 15 years

481
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:28,470
and several dead wives,
but daddy finally understands

482
00:25:28,475 --> 00:25:30,539
that I'm still his little girl,

483
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:34,175
and he is going to use
every last resource

484
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,811
that he has left to get
me out of this hell hole

485
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:39,247
and as far away from Gotham as possible.

486
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:42,082
Alice, we've been over this.

487
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,619
Your father is incarcerated himself.

488
00:25:44,624 --> 00:25:46,887
No one is coming to rescue you.

489
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:48,622
Unh!

490
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:50,558
Oh, okay. Everyone stay calm.

491
00:25:50,563 --> 00:25:52,029
Daddy?

492
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,530
What? No.

493
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:57,097
Alice, we're going. Let's go.

494
00:25:57,102 --> 00:26:01,135
- Get off of me!
- I need you to come with me!

495
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,642
Help, help! Help! Help me!

496
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:09,209
I see she's found the appendix.

497
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:11,612
Starting with the unnecessary
organs first,

498
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:13,517
prolonging the inevitable.

499
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:17,317
Appendix is out. Luke, where are you?

500
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:19,389
Headed to the roof as we speak.

501
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,027
I can't stop any of Liam's
previous commands.

502
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:28,929
Only he can do that,
but this should protect

503
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:31,334
everyone from any of
his future commands.

504
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:53,456
Get ready to rock.

505
00:27:01,198 --> 00:27:02,995
What are you doing?

506
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,065
Put your phones away.

507
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,234
Stop!

508
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:09,572
Stop!

509
00:27:26,156 --> 00:27:28,687
Alice, I need you!

510
00:27:28,692 --> 00:27:31,723
Mary needs you! Open this damn door!

511
00:27:31,728 --> 00:27:34,226
My dad is gonna take me
away from Gotham,

512
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:35,797
from all of you!

513
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:40,165
- Leave me alone!
- Your dad's not coming, Alice!

514
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,000
He is. He told me.

515
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:44,336
He... he promised in...
in his postcards.

516
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:45,737
He... he promised.

517
00:27:45,742 --> 00:27:47,476
- What, these?
- Yeah.

518
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:54,647
This is an ad from a magazine, Alice.

519
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:56,215
It's for soap.

520
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,318
This is a page from
the Arkham directory,

521
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:01,287
a napkin from the cafeteria.

522
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:03,153
This is a coloring book page!

523
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:05,423
- What?
- Your dad is not writing to you.

524
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:06,991
He sent me these.

525
00:28:06,996 --> 00:28:09,059
I read them with my own eyes.

526
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,562
Your mind is playing tricks on you.

527
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,364
Look. I get it.

528
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:16,266
You lost Ocean, your dad, Kate.

529
00:28:16,271 --> 00:28:18,135
Now you're back in here. It's too much.

530
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,539
He's coming because he
promised me he's coming.

531
00:28:21,544 --> 00:28:23,544
It's garbage, Alice!

532
00:28:35,992 --> 00:28:37,822
Help us.

533
00:28:37,827 --> 00:28:40,424
If you help us,

534
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,827
you can run,

535
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:44,998
and I won't stop you.

536
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,065
Ha ha ha!

537
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,503
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

538
00:29:00,611 --> 00:29:02,909
I'm sure that was a lot.

539
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:05,014
You want to talk about it?

540
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:08,982
There's no point.

541
00:29:08,987 --> 00:29:13,653
Did you say something? Alice?

542
00:29:13,658 --> 00:29:17,026
Alice, did you say something?

543
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:24,998
Well, I can't exactly meet
my future boyfriend

544
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:27,036
in this, can I?

545
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:44,183
Mary.

546
00:29:44,188 --> 00:29:45,450
I'm here. What do we do?

547
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:46,989
How do we save him?

548
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,990
We can't.

549
00:29:51,995 --> 00:29:54,759
I took his appendix, his gallbladder,

550
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:57,762
a kidney, his spleen.

551
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,497
I'm down to vitals.

552
00:29:59,502 --> 00:30:01,834
I have to keep removing his organs

553
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,970
until he dies.

554
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:08,172
- Then kill him.
- What?

555
00:30:08,777 --> 00:30:11,608
Kill him. He's got no chance

556
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:13,677
if you remove anything else.

557
00:30:13,682 --> 00:30:16,113
We shock his heart,
he goes into cardiac arrest

558
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:18,316
and dies just like
the Mad Hatter guy wanted.

559
00:30:18,321 --> 00:30:20,218
It'll break his mind control.

560
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:21,585
But then what?

561
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,287
Then we pray like hell you can bring

562
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:25,123
Dr. Hall back to life.

563
00:30:47,648 --> 00:30:51,547
Graduates wearing those
pretentious stethoscopes,

564
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:53,449
make them useful.

565
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:56,322
Tie them around your throats!

566
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:15,157
Unh!

567
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,198
Hyah! Unh!

568
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:31,466
What the hell happened?

569
00:31:31,471 --> 00:31:33,405
The damn suit fritzed out again.

570
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:41,676
Okay. No pulse. He's dead.

571
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:42,877
How do you feel?

572
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:45,012
Like I have my own brain back.

573
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:47,949
It worked. I broke his control.

574
00:31:47,954 --> 00:31:50,217
Good. Hopefully, this does, too.

575
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:52,454
Okay.

576
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:53,822
Charge.

577
00:31:55,294 --> 00:31:56,928
Clear.

578
00:31:58,297 --> 00:32:01,195
Charge.

579
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,230
Clear.

580
00:32:09,442 --> 00:32:12,006
Such wasted potential.

581
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:16,710
Ah, the old strangle
yourself to death gag.

582
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,011
It's a classic.

583
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,446
You're supposed to be in Arkham.

584
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:21,582
Well, I had to meet my number one fan.

585
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:23,884
Heh heh. What did I miss?

586
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:26,219
Do you remember when you
forced Catherine Hamilton

587
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:28,254
to reveal what a garbage human she is

588
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:29,523
in front of all her peers?

589
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:31,358
- Mm-hmm.
- I just did the same thing

590
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:32,860
to her daughter.

591
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:34,928
- Clever boy.
- It's true.

592
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:36,397
Doctors are all the same.

593
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:38,465
They think they're gods amongst men.

594
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,367
Why should I be institutionalized?

595
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:41,969
Because you think I'm crazy?

596
00:32:41,974 --> 00:32:44,605
Because I see the world
a little differently than you?

597
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,172
Sorry for being my own person!

598
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:49,742
Heh heh. I heard you filmed yourself

599
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:51,644
throwing a kitten off a rooftop.

600
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:53,780
- You heard about that.
- Mmm. Yeah.

601
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:56,516
Did you see it? 5,070 views.

602
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,051
Heh heh.

603
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:01,421
Tell all these people to stop.

604
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:05,591
Alice... they have too much power.

605
00:33:05,596 --> 00:33:06,606
Think about it.

606
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:08,461
All they have to do is
sign a piece of paper,

607
00:33:08,466 --> 00:33:10,029
and surprise, you're bankrupt!

608
00:33:10,034 --> 00:33:11,632
Surprise, you're addicted to medication.

609
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:13,433
Surprise, you're labeled crazy

610
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:15,668
forever and ever.

611
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:18,003
I'm not crazy, Alice!

612
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:21,538
If any of these people die,

613
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:24,943
they will have a reason
to lock you away forever.

614
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:28,747
Do you think I'm crazy?

615
00:33:28,752 --> 00:33:30,485
The truth.

616
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:36,621
No...

617
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:38,760
I don't think you're crazy.

618
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:46,130
If it wasn't for you, guys like me

619
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:48,900
wouldn't have heroes.

620
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:51,102
Stop killing yourselves.

621
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:53,007
Get out of here.

622
00:33:56,078 --> 00:34:01,579
There. Did that... earn me a hug?

623
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:04,949
Heh. Yeah.

624
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:06,353
Ahem.

625
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,925
Frequency jammers.

626
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,127
You're as crazy as they come, dear.

627
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:21,699
Word of advice... don't
ever meet your heroes.

628
00:34:21,704 --> 00:34:24,671
You really are the monster
they say you are.

629
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,274
That's me.

630
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,909
What the hell are you?

631
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,478
I didn't kill him. He's fine.

632
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:50,583
You didn't think I was
actually gonna let you go?

633
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,754
You two-faced bitch.

634
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,757
I saved all those people for you.

635
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:03,929
No. For you because in that warped mind

636
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:06,332
you somehow thought today
would undo the hundreds

637
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,933
of horrible things you've done.

638
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:13,004
Please. This is about payback

639
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:15,473
because you can't handle the truth.

640
00:35:15,478 --> 00:35:17,508
Don't hate me because
your family might be

641
00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:18,744
more screwed up than mine.

642
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,381
Get her out of here!

643
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:25,884
In conclusion, my fellow graduates,

644
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:28,320
I challenge each and every one of you

645
00:35:28,325 --> 00:35:31,489
to wake up every morning
and ask yourself

646
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:36,995
"How can I end this day
better than how it started?"

647
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,198
With one more saved life,

648
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:44,502
one more cancer-free scan,
one more smile

649
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:48,105
because if we can do that every day,

650
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,774
together, we can leave this world

651
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:53,778
a better place than how we found it.

652
00:35:53,783 --> 00:35:56,112
Whoo! A happy ending

653
00:35:56,117 --> 00:35:58,649
to the worst commencement
ceremony in history.

654
00:35:58,654 --> 00:36:01,351
Thanks. Look.

655
00:36:01,356 --> 00:36:04,054
Today, was awful,

656
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:07,391
and Liam is obviously sick,

657
00:36:07,396 --> 00:36:09,493
but he did make some good points

658
00:36:09,498 --> 00:36:11,262
about the medical community

659
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:14,164
like for one maybe
we should stop referring

660
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:16,667
to troubled people as crazy lunatics.

661
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:18,669
Even Alice?

662
00:36:18,674 --> 00:36:21,071
Heh. Even Alice.

663
00:36:21,076 --> 00:36:23,039

she's still your mom.

699
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:52,326
My whole life I wanted a family,

700
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:55,897
I wanted answers, I wanted
to belong to someone

701
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:57,465
and for someone to belong to me,

702
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,601
but that look on Liam's face today

703

when Alice wasn't
who he needed her to be,

704

it's not worth it.

707
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:35,101
Yeah.

00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:37,603

00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:46,345
before I've had my red wine.

714
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,280

Why are you bothering me with it?

717
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:54,187
Because I don't think you'll want
the cyber team looking into it.

718
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:56,956

for very specific data,

00:39:14,778 --> 00:39:17,108
Lucas Fox.

721
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,148
If you're hearing this message,

722
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,684
it means you found the suit.

723
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:28,319
Dad?

724
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,655
Dad, how am I hearing
your voice right now?

725
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,123
Because I'm your dad,

726
00:39:32,128 --> 00:39:35,062
and I always know when you need me.

727
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,905
_

728
00:39:47,543 --> 00:39:50,410
_

729
00:40:00,288 --> 00:40:03,754
Never seen you before. You a cop?

730
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:06,794
Fortunately for you, no.

731
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:12,262
How do you have this list?

732
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:14,364
Over a dozen weapons of mass destruction

733
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:16,299
are belly up in the Gotham
river somewhere,

734
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:18,368
and your main concern is how I know?

735
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:19,703
I'm cleaning it up.

736
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,504
I'm sure that warms
the parents of the kid

737
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:23,876
whose buddy slit open
his throat the other night.

738
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,777
Where'd you get this list?

739
00:40:27,782 --> 00:40:30,346
From me

740
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:33,917
in exchange for my freedom.

741
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:35,752
I don't know who you are,

742
00:40:35,757 --> 00:40:38,187
but teaming up with Gotham's
most prolific criminal

743
00:40:38,192 --> 00:40:39,455
is gonna blow up in your face.

744
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,691
It worked out well for you today.

745
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:42,058
You and Alice stopped a madman,

746
00:40:42,063 --> 00:40:43,064
and he's just the beginning.

747
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,065
- Why did you call me here?
- You're strong,

748
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,100
and you have access.

749
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:47,436
She's got the mind of a psychopath,

750
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,670
so together, you two
are gonna find and stop

751
00:40:49,675 --> 00:40:51,735
every freak who gets his hands
on one of these weapons

752
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:53,702
until each of the items
on that list are found

753
00:40:53,707 --> 00:40:55,640
and accounted for.

754
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,175
Hard pass.

755
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,077
It's just as easy for me to shut down

756
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:06,147
your illegal vigilante operation...

757
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:07,753
Ryan Wilder.

758
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,821
- Heh.
- Wow!

759
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:17,926
All that time my boyfriend,
father, sister spent

760
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:19,961
trying to break through
to my good side...

761
00:41:19,966 --> 00:41:22,530
tsk, tsk, tsk... silly them.

762
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:25,737
It's so much more fun on my bad side.

763
00:41:28,508 --> 00:41:30,505
So do we have a deal or what?

764
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,141
Oh, yes. I for one am in.

765
00:41:33,146 --> 00:41:36,478
Batwoman, answer the question.

766
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:38,279
You in,

767
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:39,984
or are you hanging up the cape?

768
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:48,359
Sounds like I don't have a choice.

769
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,800
Greg, move your head!
