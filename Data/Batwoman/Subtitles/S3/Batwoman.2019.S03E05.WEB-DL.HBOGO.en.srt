1
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,240
<i>No!</i>

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,360
- Stop!
- This is terrifying.

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,840
They released this to the public?

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,360
Keep your nasty feet
on your side of the couch.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,240
Fine. Jeez.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,040
- You call yourself a roommate.
- No, I don't.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,480
I'm a military-trained babysitter

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,680
who makes sure
you're receiving your proper meds.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,880
Did you hear that?

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,080
Someone's on the balcony.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,760
You drank my pinot?
I was saving that.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm sorry.
It didn't have your name on it.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,280
It's my damn house.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,000
Assume everything
has my name on it.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,320
Do you want the psychotic slasher
out there to hear us?

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,440
On three.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,760
One, two, three!

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,360
- The door was locked.
- What's going on?

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,600
I'm here for her. Get dressed.

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,440
Oh, actually, I'm super comfy here

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,520
in Sophie's ex-husband's
really cool sports tee.

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,360
Renee intercepted some 911 call with
a lead on a possible Rogue weapon.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,960
Get your ass dressed.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,160
Well, this certainly makes snuggling
with Sophie same same.

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,200
Can you have a little respect
and help me get him down?

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,640
Why are we rushing?

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm pretty sure he's dead already.

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,120
Yeah, well...

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,320
It's only a matter of time

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,600
before DCPD shows up
and takes our evidence.

31
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,480
Please tell me we don't have
to recover his undies.

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Just the bindings.

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,360
Renee thinks the culprit
used Catwoman's bullwhip.

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,840
As in one of the Bat trophies?

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,040
Well, this was easy. Found it.

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,240
Can I please go back
to my movie night now?

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,520
I don't think
this is Catwoman's whip.

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,080
I don't care
if it belonged to Indiana Jones.

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,480
If Renee thinks it is, let her,
so she can cross

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,600
another weapon off her list

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,480
and I can be one step closer
to earning my freedom.

42
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
According to Luke,
Catwoman and Batman had a thing.

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,680
A thing? So much leather.

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,640
- How did that work?
- Well, for her...

45
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,680
She apparently stole
some of Batman's nanotech

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,080
and wove it into her whip
making it indestructible.

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,640
This looks like it was cut
with a pocket knife.

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,880
I'll have someone from Mary's clinic
pick up the body

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,440
so she can do
a thorough exam.

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,360
You need to figure out
who killed this guy.

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,840
- And you, partner?
- I have dinner plans.

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,080
Renee literally has these missions
hanging over our heads.

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,320
Who could possibly be more important?

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,600
Someone who has much more
hanging over mine.

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,320
My mother.

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,000
No, Mrs. Baxter.

57
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,920
I did not use your investments
to fund a luxury music festival.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
Wayne stock is down 53%

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
and our crisis management team
just quit.

60
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,600
As CEO, I urge you
please ignore the tabloids.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,600
- I told you, I will fix this.
- Yeah. Okay.

62
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,960
When? The company is in the red
for the first time ever

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,440
and you've been
on non-stop damage control

64
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,600
for the last three days.

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,840
What is this?

66
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,800
Uh, roomie, when you took out
the trash this morning, you clearly

67
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,000
forgot to dump out
Jada's dinner party invitation.

68
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,160
It came by courier yesterday.

69
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,560
Of course, she turns an easy email
into a massive carbon footprint.

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,680
She just tanked Wayne.

71
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,440
Why would she ever think
that you'd wanna go?

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,080
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

73
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,480
You're going?

74
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,040
Alice found evidence linking
Jeturian to Black Glove.

75
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,000
Alice, who is literally
hallucinating so badly

76
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,800
that we had to pull her
out of an insane asylum.

77
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,720
Okay. Look, we need
to find something

78
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,120
to hang over Jada's head
like she has over mine.

79
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,840
Until then, she we will always
have us at her mercy.

80
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,960
We need a smoking gun.

81
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,000
So we bug her office,
see what we find out.

82
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,400
{\an5}She's not inviting you over
to show you her silk linens, Ryan.

83
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,760
She has an agenda.

84
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,880
And if she was able to uncover
Wayne's hidden accounts...

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,400
{\an5}Sorry. What was I saying?

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,960
{\an5}If she was able to uncover
Wayne's hidden accounts...

87
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,880
Exactly. Then who's to say she can't
uncover your hidden identity too?

88
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,240
You're right. I need to be careful.

89
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,840
{\an5}Which is why I'm bringing backup.

90
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,600
{\an5}- So you're Ryan's date?
- So saw that coming.

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,120
{\an5}It's not a date. It's recon.

92
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,360
{\an5}But you're wearing a push-up bra,
so it's a date.

93
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,200
{\an5}You know this is your fault, right?

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,760
{\an5}Don't blame me
for this repulsive love affair.

95
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,160
{\an5}If you'd never told Ryan

96
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,400
that her biological mother

97
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,680
was still alive,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

98
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,560
{\an5}Soph, the guilt I think
I'm supposed to be feeling

99
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,280
{\an5}is seriously killing
my hallucination-free vibes.

100
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,320
Seriously, for the last three days

101
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,400
{\an5}it's just been me, myself, and I.

102
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,200
The meds are working.

103
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,800
Crazy Alice is crazy no more.
Don't poke the bear.

104
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,560
Tell me that you hear that.

105
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,960
It's your phone.

106
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,720
It's Montoya.

107
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,840
{\an5}Seriously, people, I am on vacation.

108
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,960
Oh, no.

109
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,880
You're a criminal
who's on work release.

110
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,000
And she said to get your ass
to her office now.

111
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,040
May I offer you a beverage
while you wait?

112
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,440
The Madam recommends
a 1994 <i>Cote des Blancs.</i>

113
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,280
We're good.

114
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,920
Very well.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
{\an5}Madam Jet will be down shortly.

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,120
"Madam Jet will be down shortly."
Is she for real?

117
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,720
{\an5}As real as the bling
in her chandelier.

118
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,360
{\an5}I feel like the foster kid
who isn't allowed to sit on anything.

119
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,920
{\an5}That's the point.

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,280
{\an5}This is an intimidation move
to get in your head.

121
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Make you think you have nothing
and she's got everything.

122
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,160
Shouldn't be too hard considering
my last address was my license plate.

123
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,960
{\an5}Ryan, I'm glad you could come.

124
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,400
Oh, I see you brought a friend.

125
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,120
Girlfriend, actually.

126
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,640
Sophie. Nice to meet you.

127
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,400
{\an5}- You as well.
- Sorry to interrupt, Madam.

128
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,800
The chef assures me
he has things covered here.

129
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,640
Great. Good night, Damien.

130
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,600
On your way out,
would you please inform him

131
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,960
that we'll be having another?

132
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,200
{\an5}Yes, Madam.

133
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,360
Chef, the Madam has requested
preparations for another guest.

134
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,560
Oh, the more the merrier.

135
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,400
There, there, little pig.

136
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,520
Time for the professor
to teach the class how to squeal.

137
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,280
So how did you two meet?

138
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,040
- Through friends.
- Through friends.

139
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,840
Was it a Tuesday?

140
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,800
Definitely, because it was, uh...

141
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,280
Taco night.

142
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,200
And you offered to buy me a drink
to wash down

143
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,880
- the chips.
- The chips.

144
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Uh, you know...

145
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,720
You know, when the corner
of a chip gets stuck

146
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
in the back of your throat?

147
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,440
Yeah. Just the coughing,
choking, watery eyes.

148
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,840
I mean, I think
there was sweat involved.

149
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,720
- Sounds romantic.
- It wasn't cute.

150
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,240
But that's the point.

151
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,440
I mean, someone sees you
at your not-cutest

152
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,920
and still asks you out.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,800
I mean, at the end of the day,
we just want someone who's loyal.

154
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,800
I know that if I were dying,
Sophie would

155
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,960
sit beside me, put her arms around me

156
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,680
and tell me everything will be okay.

157
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,040
Excuse me. Bathroom?

158
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,800
Last room down the hall.

159
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
We should all be so lucky.

160
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,880
That was beautiful.

161
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,120
Yeah.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
Now let's get ugly.

163
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Why am I here?

164
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
If this is your olive branch

165
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,800
for destroying my company,
you're gonna need a damn orchard.

166
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,120
I couldn't have been more clear

167
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
when I told you to stay away
from my family.

168
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,680
And now I'm in your living room,
so, what the hell is going on?

169
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,840
Whatever is going on between you
and Marquis needs to stop.

170
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,880
- Who says something's going on?
- A mother always knows.

171
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,400
Now I need you to ask your girl
to leave so I can get real with you.

172
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,600
Get real?

173
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
Rich coming from the woman
who convinced me she was dead.

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,320
Dying will be the easy part, Ryan,
for you and a lot of folks

175
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,440
if you don't do exactly what I say.

176
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,720
Yo! Nobody at the door?

177
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,760
Where's my man, Damien?

178
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,720
You never know what kind of a psycho
might come waltzing into this place.

179
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,840
Marquis, what are you doing here?

180
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,680
Heard there was a family dinner.

181
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,120
- Batcave?
- Copy. Are you in?

182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,680
Ten bedrooms and 15 bathrooms later,
I found her study.

183
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
Okay. Good. Find somewhere central

184
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,520
away from A/C vents, shredders,
anything that creates noise.

185
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,880
All right.
I'm at her desk. Fire it up.

186
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,120
Testing. One, two, three.

187
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
All right. We are up.
Now get out of there.

188
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,240
I will. In two seconds.

189
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,040
Sophie, I strongly suggest
that you get out of there.

190
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,280
Looks like Ryan wasn't the only one
cut out of the family.

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm gonna send you a face
to run through rec.

192
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,280
Uh, go for it. Standing by.

193
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Sophie?

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,440
Luke? Do you copy?

195
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,000
Hey! Hey! Sophie!

196
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,320
Luke, do you copy?

197
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
The powder room's
on the first floor, honey.

198
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,320
Big house. Got lost.

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Dinner's ready.

200
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,640
We're supposed to have
a secret partnership

201
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,680
and you're sitting
there having secret dinners with her.

202
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,880
Whose side are you on?

203
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,400
I hate to break it to you,
she already knows

204
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,520
about the partnership.

205
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,760
How?

206
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,640
Can we please eat
before any more guests arrive?

207
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,080
So she doesn't think it's a trophy.

208
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,080
Something about Batman and Catwoman
between the sheets.

209
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,000
Personally, I didn't think
heroes did that sort of thing

210
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,640
but, uh, what do I know,
I'm a villain.

211
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,560
Then prove me wrong.

212
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,000
This is a record of every Rogue
that's tormented Gotham.

213
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,680
If it's not a Catwoman wannabe

214
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,480
then use that beautifully
demented mind and tell me

215
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,400
who would string up a naked man
in an auto shop with a bullwhip?

216
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,600
Magpie. Not possible.

217
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,840
Too many shiny piercings
left on the victim.

218
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,480
Shelly Gaynor aka The Whip.

219
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,000
Sounds promising.

220
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,920
Nope. Animal advocate.

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,520
Her whip was faux leather.

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,560
Oh, this one is kinkier
than a garden hose

223
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,120
but, um, Talia Al Ghul
is far too impatient

224
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,480
for performative victim staging.

225
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
I think we found our girl.

226
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,160
Manipulative,
obsessive, backstabbing.

227
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,720
Who is she?

228
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
You.

229
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,520
What's with your creepy obsession
with Poison Ivy?

230
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,720
What are you talking about?

231
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,920
Your case files
on everyone else are anemic.

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,600
But this one on Pamela Isley

233
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,760
reads like you're planning
on writing a biopic.

234
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,440
Juicy interviews,
detailed facts sheets.

235
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,960
A confidential
psychological evaluation.

236
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,240
Now you need you to prove me wrong.

237
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,560
Are Batwoman and I looking
for these weapons of mass destruction

238
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,520
to stop criminals?

239
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,960
Because I think
that you brought us together

240
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,400
to find one viney vixen
in particular.

241
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,720
Anybody else feel a little sorry
for that thing?

242
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,720
Roasted suckling is considered
a delicacy in most of the world.

243
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,400
I'm vegan, so it doesn't matter
which continent my ass is on.

244
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,760
I'm not touching that.

245
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,240
Perhaps more wine
will enhance the experience.

246
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,280
Our esteemed chef flew
from Metropolis to cook for us.

247
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,760
He comes highly recommended.

248
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,000
So, if I may,
you're the estranged daughter

249
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,280
who just recently bonded
with your brother?

250
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Well, that's bad because he has

251
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,120
a co-dependent relationship
with his mother

252
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,560
who now sees you as a threat
to her relationship with her son.

253
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,880
Zoey's dissertation
is on modern family dynamics.

254
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,000
Particularly
Triangulation as it relates

255
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,800
to Bowen's Family Theory paradigm,
rescuer, victim, persecutor.

256
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,280
That's interesting.

257
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,040
Does Bowen have a term
for backstabbing sisters?

258
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,440
I need the ladies.
Tannins go right through me.

259
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,240
Backstabbing sisters?

260
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,320
I wasn't the one who orchestrated
this whole dinner.

261
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,560
Jada did.

262
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,000
Was that what you wanted?

263
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,120
Marquis finds out I'm having dinner
with his mom so he stops trusting me?

264
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,120
If we're going to have a conversation
about trust, let's talk about

265
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,400
what your girlfriend thought
she was going to find in my study.

266
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,560
Exactly. So don't talk to me
about having an agenda.

267
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,480
You're right, Jada.
I did come here with an agenda.

268
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,200
I came to say thank you.

269
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
Thank you for giving me up.

270
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,960
Thank you for walking away

271
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,040
and letting me
be someone else's problem.

272
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,440
Because I didn't get the butlers

273
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,520
or the five-course meal,
or the mansion.

274
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,080
I got a home. I got love.
I got a real mother.

275
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,520
Should have known, Zoey.
Wine and family drama do not mix.

276
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
Why can't I feel anything?

277
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,760
Turn the faucet, Zoey.

278
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,200
Gotta say,
I'm not about to let my baby sister

279
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,880
win best speech of the night.

280
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
Marquis, haven't we had
enough theatrics for one evening?

281
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,600
Don't worry. I'll keep it simple.

282
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,960
To family and loyalty.

283
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,800
You okay?

284
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,320
I can't feel my arms.

285
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,840
Relax.

286
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,440
Just a little paralytic.

287
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,320
Okay. Maybe a lot of paralytic.

288
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,280
Get away from us.

289
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,240
You're not an easy woman
to get alone.

290
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,560
Practically had to convince you
I was royalty

291
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,600
to get the keys to the kingdom.

292
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,760
You don't remember me, Mrs. Jet?

293
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,360
I have no idea who you are.

294
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,680
Do you really fire so many people,
they're all a blur?

295
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,360
Lazlo Valentin.

296
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,560
I was a chef in the dining hall
at your office until you fired me.

297
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,720
Valentin. Okay. I remember the name.

298
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,440
Good for you!

299
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,640
You know what I remember?

300
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,360
Telling my family

301
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,280
"Hey, guys, no more money's
coming in for a while."

302
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
"Boss lady hates daddy's cooking

303
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,040
so now nobody wants
to hire him anymore." Yeah.

304
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,680
And I remember the divorce papers,
the debt collectors, the repo man...

305
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,480
Do you really think she remembers
the damn cook from the building caf?

306
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,040
- Marquis!
- No. You probably said

307
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,240
the food sucked
and your staff replaced his ass.

308
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,600
- It's just business, bro.
- Just business?

309
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,840
I lost my family because of her.

310
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,320
So now you'll lose yours.

311
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,080
You told Marquis about this dinner?

312
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,600
How else could you watch me
chop him into bacon bits?

313
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,840
But the unexpected daughter?

314
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,600
Talk about an <i>amuse-bouche</i>.

315
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,600
Marquis, come on.
Get up. We gotta go.

316
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,840
I can't... I can't move.

317
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,240
Zoey, she's still upstairs.

318
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,240
I got him. Go!

319
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,200
I'll find Zoey.

320
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,760
You guys get outside
and call for help.

321
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,960
I got you.

322
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,200
Come on.

323
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,120
Zoey. Zoey, we gotta go.

324
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,440
It won't open. Why won't it open?

325
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,720
He must have locked us in
from the outside.

326
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,120
- My phone has no service.
- Mine either.

327
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Which little piggy went to market?

328
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,160
Which little piggy
should have stayed home?

329
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,920
Upstairs. Follow me.

330
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,760
Go. Go without me.

331
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,760
No. Marquis, come on.
You can do this. Let's go.

332
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,400
A lesson from Professor Pyg
nobody likes an uninvited guest!

333
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,040
Come on. Come on!

334
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,920
<i>I'll huff and I'll puff,
and burn your house down!</i>

335
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,440
He's gone.

336
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
For now.

337
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,240
Zoey's dead.

338
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,560
Oh, my God.

339
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,720
And he's not leaving this house
until we are too.

340
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,920
- What is this place?
- It's a panic room.

341
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,520
I converted one of my closets
a few years back.

342
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,120
You must have a lot of enemies.

343
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,120
Secret closet space and all.

344
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,400
Signal's dead.

345
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,320
I had a call drop earlier.

346
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,960
He must have activated
some sort of signal blocker.

347
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,520
Tell me you have a gun in here.

348
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,800
I don't believe in guns.

349
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,080
What's wrong, not torturous enough?

350
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,680
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Everyone just chill, okay?

351
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,440
Someone will eventually realize
we're missing

352
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,520
and come looking for us,
we just need to hang until then.

353
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Marquis?

354
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,760
Marquis? Marquis, Marquis!

355
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Marquis!

356
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,640
Pamela and I met at Gotham U.

357
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,960
I was studying Criminal Law, she was
into Botany, complete opposites

358
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,240
but couldn't see a future
without the other.

359
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,080
Love that.

360
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,640
At the same time,
one of her classmates

361
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,440
was conducting these
obsessive experiments for his Ph.D.

362
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,480
He and Pam were competitive.

363
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,520
Both super smart, kind of nerdy.

364
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
She thought it was harmless

365
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,080
until one night he abducted Pam
and used her as his guinea pig.

366
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,360
Let me guess, that'd be Marc LeGrand?

367
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,480
Whatever he injected her with
was poison.

368
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,120
Some awful combination of things
around his lab.

369
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,600
Oleander, nightshade, water hemlock.

370
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
It changed her entire physiology.

371
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,440
Turned her
into a green-thumbed psycho.

372
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,720
But she didn't see it that way.

373
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,080
She wanted to save the planet

374
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,160
and that meant punishing anyone
destroying it.

375
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,640
Except an up-and-coming cop
shacking up with a serial killer

376
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,040
kind of puts a cramp
in the ol' career trajectory.

377
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,000
She went from compassionate
and loving

378
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,120
to reckless and irrational overnight.

379
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,360
Total personality change,
eventually, it just tore us apart.

380
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,880
Subtext, you chose your career
over your girl.

381
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,520
She was lost.

382
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,440
Okay? Gone emotionally, mentally.

383
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,480
A shell of the person I knew,
and I...

384
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,680
I was young,
I had no idea how to save her.

385
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,160
Oh, relax.

386
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,560
I'm not actually invested
in your love story.

387
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,040
So where's Poison Pam?

388
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,440
That's a question for Batman.

389
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,040
Well, she's not in Arkham.

390
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,880
I would know.

391
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
And boring Batman
didn't actually kill anyone.

392
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,280
So, unless she slithered up
Jack's beanstalk...

393
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,520
My theory is he hid her

394
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,120
under the city somewhere,
away from water and sunlight

395
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,640
and anyone she could hurt.

396
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,840
Why would Batman
bury your girlfriend alive?

397
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,960
Because I told him to.

398
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,360
This shouldn't be happening.

399
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,960
What shouldn't happen?

400
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,160
This long, sappy tangent.

401
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,600
Especially when there's
a potential sadist on the loose.

402
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,160
I'm going to go see
our medical expert

403
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,280
and see if she found anything
on the vic's body.

404
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,560
Drink the water, Marquis.

405
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,920
We're gonna make sure he's okay.

406
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,840
He drank the most,
so it's hitting him first

407
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,240
but it's only a matter of time
before it's all of us.

408
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,560
Okay, okay.

409
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,000
Sixty-five over thirty.

410
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,240
That's bad.

411
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,880
If it keeps dropping, he's gonna die.

412
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,120
He needs adrenaline.

413
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,320
I know.

414
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,640
There's none in here.

415
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,120
There are EpiPens.

416
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,000
My husband carried them
for his allergies.

417
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,200
- Where?
- With our camping gear.

418
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,560
In the basement.

419
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,480
Tell me there's another way
to get into the basement.

420
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,640
What the hell is he doing?

421
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,040
Building a bomb.

422
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm gonna need your help.

423
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Come on.

424
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
Lazlo?

425
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,080
Lazlo?

426
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,240
Where are you?

427
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,880
Lazlo, I want a truce.

428
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,480
You need money? How much?

429
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,200
I'll give you anything you want.
Let's talk.

430
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,440
<i>Lazlo? I'm sorry.</i>

431
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,000
<i>I really am.</i>

432
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,080
Wasn't pretty, but she made it.

433
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,280
So are you really Ryan's girlfriend
or was that a lie too?

434
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,240
Wanna know who I really am?

435
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,960
I'm Jordan Moore's sister.

436
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,120
I'm sorry, I'm light-headed,
am I supposed to know who that is?

437
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
Your men abducted her...

438
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
and injected her with freeze serum.

439
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,480
Killed three of her friends,
nearly killed her.

440
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,320
What? What are you talking about?

441
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,520
Stop.

442
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,360
Don't tell me you didn't know
about human experiments

443
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,200
being conducted
by your own employees.

444
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,000
So was that what you were doing
in my study?

445
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,840
Looking for evidence?

446
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,800
What'd you find, Sophie?
The Anarchist Cookbook?

447
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,520
Look, I am sorry about what happened
to your sister

448
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,680
but I had nothing to do with that.

449
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm not the monster
you've made me out to be.

450
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,200
Stay with me, son.

451
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,960
Mama's here.

452
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,920
Of course.

453
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,440
Okay. Okay.

454
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,240
Come on, Ryan. Move your arm.

455
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,480
Move your damn arm!

456
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,400
Come on!

457
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,360
Come on!

458
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,320
Vic had motorcycle grease
underneath his fingernails.

459
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,960
I found a similar but not exact
viscous synthetic on the bullwhip.

460
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,240
Fascinating.

461
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,200
What's with the botanical garden?

462
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,080
Oh, did the medical board
take away your license

463
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,840
and leave you to the whims
of herbal medicine?

464
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,400
Do you know
how I saved Jordan Moore's life?

465
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,640
I mimicked the antifreeze synthesis
done by plants

466
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,160
to survive subzero temperatures.

467
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,440
You wanna know why?

468
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,280
Because plants are smarter
than humans.

469
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,840
They're resilient, they're intuitive.

470
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,360
- They give back more than they take.
- Got it.

471
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,320
Jeez. Sorry I asked.

472
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,240
Anyway, do you remember

473
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,400
when you were being
all hero-complex-y and told me

474
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,040
because you're an "official"

475
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,360
doctor now, it is your duty
to help me when the time comes?

476
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
Well...

477
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,200
that time is upon us.

478
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,760
The delusions are back.

479
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,920
Between the inmates

480
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,880
in Arkham, the experimental meds,
the general

481
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,440
mise-en-scene of captivity,
I assumed it was the asylum

482
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,040
that was making me crazy.

483
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,160
Don't get me wrong.

484
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,960
I have enjoyed my fair share
of disassociation.

485
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
You're talking to the girl

486
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,360
who convinced herself
that 12 years of sewing skin masks

487
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,040
was a fancy tea party.

488
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,240
But I was in control then.
This is different.

489
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,080
I'm not in control anymore.

490
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,720
As if what's happening isn't obvious?

491
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,160
You reap what you sow, Alice.

492
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,720
All of the murders,
the pain, the misery

493
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,160
that you've inflicted,
they were the seeds that you planted

494
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,760
for the garden you'll be buried in.

495
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Got it.

496
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,840
Speaking of gardens,
where have you been frolicking?

497
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,600
Gotham Park.

498
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,840
I think I exposed myself
to whatever that thing is.

499
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,560
I took a sample of the vine
but I can't figure out

500
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,360
if it's poison oak, poison sumac,
poison hemlock.

501
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,560
Poison Ivy.

502
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,680
<i>Let me in!</i>

503
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,280
Oh, my God.

504
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,000
He's got Ryan.

505
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,800
<i>Open this door right now!</i>

506
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,840
But he wants you.

507
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,960
If I open this door,
I'm as good as dead.

508
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,040
Your lesson is that when someone

509
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,800
shows you who they are, believe them,
because if I'm how she treats

510
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,080
the people spending their days

511
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,680
trying to impress her, guess how

512
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,880
she'll treat someone
she sees as a threat!

513
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,680
Get away from my daughter.

514
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,080
Take me instead,
she did nothing to you.

515
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,400
Well, well, Madam Swine.

516
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,960
You know what your lesson is?

517
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,640
Perfection comes at a price.

518
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,840
Look out!

519
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,880
Incoming!

520
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,000
Flamingo.

521
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,040
Excuse me?

522
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,520
The bullwhip killer.

523
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,760
It's the flamboyant,
pink Harley-straddling psycho

524
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,160
Flamingo.

525
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,640
Victim was in a rival gang,
DNA evidence

526
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,400
blah, blah, blah...

527
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
science.

528
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,120
But the point is
if the biker boot fits...

529
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,360
I'll alert the victim's family

530
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,120
and put out a warrant
for this Flamingo.

531
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,440
And I guess that means
Catwoman's whip is still out there?

532
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,600
And I can't wait to get to that
when I'm back from Tahiti.

533
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,320
Because I believe that...

534
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,000
this buys me a week's vacation.

535
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,960
And what is this?

536
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,360
Your girlfriend.

537
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,320
Although she is looking
a little frail.

538
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,080
This is a dead cutting from her vine.

539
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,400
- Where did you get this?
- Does it matter?

540
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,800
I reunited you
with your long lost love.

541
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,880
To think I was confused
about Batman and Catwoman.

542
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,560
It matters,
because these vines don't die

543
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
unless...

544
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,480
Unless what?

545
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,720
Unless she's infected someone else.

546
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,400
What you thinking about?

547
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,360
What was for dessert.

548
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,280
Jada's hiding something.

549
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,000
I don't know what,
but I trust my gut on this.

550
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,800
She's lying.

551
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,560
Then it's time for her
to tell me everything.

552
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,280
I'll call you tomorrow,
tell you what I learned.

553
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Good luck.

554
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,680
Great first date, huh?

555
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,680
Definitely memorable.

556
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,040
And people wonder why
I don't throw dinner parties.

557
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
You okay?

558
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,120
Your girlfriend left this.

559
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,320
Once a Crow always a Crow, huh?

560
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,840
I didn't know about Jordan Moore.

561
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,120
Your word is not good enough, Jada.

562
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,840
Well, it has to be.

563
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,520
I didn't know about Jordan...

564
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,840
or the experiments, or the deaths.

565
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,360
How could I? I'm a mother.

566
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,200
The whole point of all of this
was that no one else get hurt.

567
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,000
The whole point of what?

568
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,400
I'm going to tell you something.

569
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,160
And for your sake and for everyone
you love's sake, you need to keep it

570
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,000
to yourself,
you need to promise me that.

571
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
I can't.

572
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,960
Not until I know what it is.

573
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,280
Marquis is sick.

574
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,640
<i>What's going on, Marquis?</i>

575
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,000
<i>What'd you get for your birthday?</i>

576
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,920
<i>A bug collector kit.</i>

577
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,640
<i>That's cool.</i>

578
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,560
<i>What are you doing
with that magnifying glass?</i>

579
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,000
<i>Melting ants.</i>

580
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,640
<i>See?</i>

581
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,520
<i>They burn up in the sun.</i>

582
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,360
There was an incident
during a school field trip.

583
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,680
Marquis was on the bus.

584
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,840
It pulled up to a stoplight.

585
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,240
And suddenly, a man dressed like
a clown, green hair, purple suit...

586
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,280
big ugly smile.

587
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,720
He jumped on board,
took over the bus.

588
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
The Joker?

589
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,800
There was an encounter with my son.

590
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,800
The Joker had this zapper
on his hand.

591
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
- The Joy Buzzer.
- Whatever it's called.

592
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,880
He pressed it
against my son's forehead

593
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,520
and an electrical charge
went through his brain.

594
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,080
After that day, he was different,
dark.

595
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,360
Horrifying.

596
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,800
Marquis?

597
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,880
No.

598
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,560
Marquis has been nothing
but nice to me.

599
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,000
Sociopaths are charming
95% of the time, Ryan.

600
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,040
<i>Mom, don't be so lame.</i>

601
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,560
<i>It's not lame to tell your dad
happy birthday.</i>

602
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,920
<i>I wrote him a card!</i>

603
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,320
<i>Sweetheart, your father's overseas
and it would mean so much to him</i>

604
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,040
<i>- if he heard it from your...
- I said no!</i>

605
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,280
Specialists, neurologists,
psychologists.

606
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,240
I have spent millions
trying to fix him behind his back

607
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,600
so I could have my sweet boy again.

608
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,960
But no one's been able to help me.

609
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,920
And then I learned of cryostasis.

610
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,240
So you were behind the freeze serum.

611
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,880
I had no idea my research team
was conducting human experiments.

612
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,600
I just thought if I could sideline

613
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,920
Marquis for a while,
it would buy me some time

614
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,280
to find a solution.

615
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,000
<i>He's going in for another bite.</i>

616
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,480
<i>How's the burger, Dad?</i>

617
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,600
<i>Delicious.</i>

618
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
<i>What the hell?</i>

619
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,240
<i>He's onto me.</i>

620
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,560
<i>Is that peanut butter?</i>

621
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,680
<i>What's wrong?</i>

622
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
<i>Peanuts!</i>

623
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
<i>Burger!</i>

624
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
<i>Franklin, where's your pen?</i>

625
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
<i>Where's your pen?</i>

626
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,920
Why are you telling me this?

627
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,840
Because everything I have done...

628
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,840
since the day we met...

629
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,600
has been to protect you, Ryan.

630
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,520
And because I need your help.

631
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,960
All I want is to stop Marquis
before anyone else gets hurt.
