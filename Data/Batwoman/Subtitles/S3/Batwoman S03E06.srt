1
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:08,486
OK. GET ON HER,
GET ON HER.

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,966
GO, GO, GO, GO!

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,363
OK, OK.
SHAKES HER DEFENDER.

4
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:17,669
PULLS UP FROM WAY DOWNTOWN,
FIRES, AAAAND...

5
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:21,064
MISSES. AW. BRICK CITY, BABY.

6
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:22,413
SHUT UP.

7
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:32,162
YO! COME ON. LET'S GO!

8
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:33,511
HANG ON A SECOND.

9
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:38,038
WHAT THE?

10
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,943
OH, HELL, NO!

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,254
HELP... HELP ME.

12
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,126
RAAGGGH!

13
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,649
AAH!

14
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:41,753
OH, MY GOD.

15
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,932
YOU'RE STANDING
ON THE FREAKING EVIDENCE.

16
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,543
MA'AM, THIS AREA'S OFF LIMITS.

17
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,390
I'M GONNA PRETEND YOU DIDN'T
JUST CALL ME MA'AM

18
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:52,286
AND INSTEAD ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

19
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,157
THIS CASE BELONGS
TO CITY HALL NOW.

20
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,637
PACK IT UP, BOYS.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,160
FREAK PATROL'S ON THE SCENE.

22
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:59,162
YOUR AMBIGUOUS
YET FAR-REACHING POWER

23
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:00,685
SUPERSEDES OURS.

24
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,774
MISS YOU, TOO, DETECTIVE.

25
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:04,187
- ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
- TAKE HIM TO THE CLINIC

26
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,038
ON BENNETT,
ASK FOR MARY HAMILTON.

27
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:10,739
WHO IS IT NOW, MONTOYA...
POLLEN BOY, CANDYMAN?

28
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,417
TELL THE COMMISSIONER
TO PREP FOR ALL HANDS ON DECK.

29
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,549
THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET
UGLY AROUND HERE.

30
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:42,988
THE VICTIM IS CHRIS HAYNER,

31
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:45,295
TRICORNER RESIDENT FOUND
ENCASED IN A BEEHIVE

32
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:46,905
IN ROBISON PARK.

33
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:48,318
YOU THINK SOMEONE
WENT THROUGH THE TROUBLE

34
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,952
OF FILLING A SHED WITH FLOWERS

35
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,346
TO DRAW IN BEES TO, WHAT,
STING THIS GUY TO DEATH?

36
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,391
I THINK THE PERP
LITERALLY BLOOMED

37
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:56,132
THE FLOWERS THEMSELVES,
WEAPONIZING

38
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,829
THE NATURAL WORLD AROUND THEM.

39
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:03,226
WHAT AM I MISSING?

40
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,967
POISON IVY.

41
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,664
MORE SPECIFICALLY, HER NEW HOST.

42
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,666
ALICE TURNED OVER IVY'S
VINE TO ME YESTERDAY.

43
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,235
IT WAS DEAD, MEANING
IT HAD ALREADY INFECTED SOMEONE.

44
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:15,020
I THINK WHOEVER DID THIS
IS THAT SOMEONE.

45
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,327
HOW DID YOU GET
POISON IVY'S VINE?

46
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,523
WHILE YOU WERE SLURPING CAVIAR
OFF OF MUMMY'S FINE CHINA,

47
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:22,289
SOME OF US WERE IN THE
FIELD PROTECTING THIS CITY.

48
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:24,421
MM-HMM. YOU JUST
SO HAPPENED TO STUMBLE

49
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:27,468
ACROSS A BATMAN TROPHY WHILE YOU WERE
TAKING A STROLL THROUGH THE PARK?

50
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:30,471
THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS ARE SO
GORGEOUS THIS TIME OF YEAR.

51
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:33,300
TRUST ME. I ALREADY
TRIED TO GET IT OUT OF HER.

52
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:36,520
WHY AREN'T YOU TELLING ME
WHAT YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

53
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:38,348
YOU LOST ME ON
THE DOUBLE NEGATIVE.

54
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,307
GUYS, WE DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS.

55
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,396
TRUST ME. I TRIED.

56
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,875
FOUND THE VIC'S PHONE
AT THE SCENE.

57
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,486
IT'S PASSCODE-PROTECTED,
BUT I THINK

58
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,270
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
HE HAD CONTACT

59
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:48,880
WITH WHOEVER DID THIS TO HIM.

60
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,708
MY COMPUTER CAN CRACK
HIS PASSCODE.

61
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:52,493
GOOD. I TOLD MARY HAMILTON
TO GIVE ME A CALL

62
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,625
AS SOON AS OUR VIC WAKES UP.

63
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,714
UH, YOU SENT HIM
TO MARY HAMILTON?

64
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:59,239
SHE'S BEEN OVERSEEING
ALL THE RIVER ROGUE CASES.

65
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,936
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

66
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:04,026
NO. NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

67
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,116
IN FACT, MARY HAMILTON
IS THE PERFECT PERSON

68
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,031
TO HELP US WITH THIS CASE.

69
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:11,686
AMEM. I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON THE VIC'S PROGRESS.

70
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:14,602
BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT A
STRANGER'S LIFE ALL OF A SUDDEN?

71
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:19,084
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T.

72
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,957
LET'S YOU AND I GO SIT
IN THE BATCAVE TOGETHER

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,785
AND WATCH THE COMPUTER
TEDIOUSLY CYCLE

74
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:26,570
THROUGH ALL THE
ANTI-ENCRYPTION CIPHERS.

75
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:29,094
HAVE FUN WITH MARY.

76
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,400
WILL DO.

77
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,323
SOPHIE, MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

78
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:43,326
SORRY. HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

79
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,591
ALICE SPILLED CHERRY
SODA ALL OVER MY LAPTOP.

80
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:50,377
BESIDES, YOU HAVE MORE EYES
IN THIS CITY THAN I DO.

81
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,117
BLACK GLOVE'S MERCENARIES
STAY INVISIBLE

82
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,163
BY DOING THINGS
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

83
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,165
THEY'RE OFF THE GRID,
THEY'RE OFF THE CLOUD.

84
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,907
SURPRISED THEY USE
ELECTRICITY AT ALL.

85
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,865
FOUND THIS SURVEILLANCE
OF JORDAN'S ATTACKER

86
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,345
LEAVING HER APARTMENT,

87
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,827
BUT I LOST HIM A BLOCK LATER.

88
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,892
SO YOU'RE WAITING FOR HIM
TO SHOW UP ON CAMERAS AGAIN?

89
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,961
UNLESS YOUR MOM
MIRACULOUSLY CAME CLEAN

90
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,050
AND OFFERED UP HER ROLODEX.

91
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:14,139
I FIGURED WHEN YOU
DIDN'T CALL LAST NIGHT,

92
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,117
CONFRONTING HER ABOUT WHAT
THESE GUYS DID TO MY SISTER

93
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:19,493
WAS A DEAD END, SO IT'S JUST YOU

94
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,190
AND ME

95
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,323
AND CRISPY JOE'S WONTONS.

96
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,502
MY MOM WASN'T RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO JORDAN.

97
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:31,374
HEH HEH. AND YOU BELIEVE HER?

98
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:37,075
YOU BELIEVE HER.

99
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,426
AND NOW I NEED YOU
TO BELIEVE ME.

100
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:43,255
MY MOM ISN'T THE MONSTER
YOU THINK SHE IS.

101
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,736
I THINK YOU SHOULD DROP IT.

102
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,826
RYAN, MY SISTER HAD EVIDENCE.

103
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,307
I MEAN, A DRAWING OF
VICTOR FRIES' CRYO CHAMBER

104
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,048
WAS FAXED DIRECTLY
TO YOUR MOM'S OFFICE.

105
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:56,094
I AM NOT SAYING SHE DIDN'T
INITIATE THE PROJECT.

106
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,445
SO YOU'RE SAYING
SHE IS INVOLVED?

107
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:01,970
I AM SAYING THAT JADA
PROMISED ME SHE HAD NO IDEA

108
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:04,146
PEOPLE WERE GOING TO GET HURT.

109
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:06,757
AND THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH?

110
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,498
3 OF JORDAN'S FRIENDS
DIED BECAUSE

111
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,544
OF YOUR MOM'S INVOLVEMENT
WITH THE FREEZE SERUM.

112
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:13,416
JORDAN IS STILL IN RECOVERY.

113
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,201
WHAT HAPPENED WAS HORRIBLE.

114
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:17,681
I AM NOT SAYING IT'S OK.

115
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:20,162
THEN WHY AREN'T YOU
WONDERING WHY,

116
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:23,034
AND WHY DOES SHE WANT IT,
AND WHY AREN'T YOU STOPPING HER?

117
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:26,124
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLICATED.

118
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:30,215
I PROMISE YOU I WILL TELL
YOU EVERYTHING WHEN I CAN.

119
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,435
WHEN YOU CAN?

120
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,132
RYAN, IT'S ME.

121
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,269
WHAT DOES SHE HAVE OVER YOU?

122
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:42,402
LET ME HELP.
I CAN GET YOU OUT OF IT.

123
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:46,057
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING OVER ME.

124
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:49,496
THEN WHY ARE YOU PROTECTING HER?

125
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:54,805
SOPHIE, I JUST NEED
YOU TO TRUST ME ON THIS.

126
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,851
- BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR MOM?
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

127
00:06:56,894 --> 00:07:00,376
OH, REALLY? BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING
IT SOUND PRETTY FREAKING SIMPLE.

128
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:20,483
MMM. TELL ME THERE'S
A JAR OF THIS SOMEWHERE.

129
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:23,878
WHY DID BATWOMAN SEND
YOU HERE TO TORTURE ME?

130
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,446
OH, SHE DIDN'T. I VOLUNTEERED.

131
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:29,753
OF COURSE YOU DID.

132
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,494
APPARENTLY, THIS IS THE WORK

133
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:34,236
OF A POISON IVY WANNABE.

134
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,983
THE QUESTION IS
WHAT KIND OF MONSTER

135
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:45,552
WOULD ENTOMB A MAN
IN A SWARM OF RAVENOUS BEES?

136
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:48,468
YOU KNOW IT'S BAD
IF IT MAKES ME CRINGE.

137
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,644
OH. I HAVE AN IDEA.

138
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:53,037
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE
AND GO FIND OUT?

139
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:55,039
THAT'S THE THING, STEPPY.

140
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,478
I THINK I ALREADY KNOW WHO
THIS DISTURBED CREATURE IS.

141
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,133
YOU.

142
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:10,228
I SEE. YOU'RE HAVING
DELUSIONS AGAIN,

143
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,926
AND INSTEAD OF ADMITTING IT

144
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,668
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON,
YOU'RE GASLIGHTING ME

145
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,496
TO AVOID BEING VULNERABLE

146
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,411
WHEN I TELL YOU
I STOPPED CARING.

147
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,893
SWEET, NAIVE MARY.
TSK, TSK, TSK.

148
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:27,115
LOOK AROUND. YOU'VE TURNED
YOUR CLINIC INTO JUMANJI,

149
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,638
YOU'RE DOWNING WATER
LIKE YOU JUST RAN

150
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:30,379
THE GOTHAM CITY MARATHON,

151
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:32,686
AND IF YOU THINK THAT
THAT IS ANYTHING

152
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,470
OTHER THAN A POISON IVY RASH,

153
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,473
YOU SHOULD GIVE BACK
THAT SHINY MEDICAL DEGREE.

154
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,389
SERIOUSLY? LOOK AT ME.

155
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,565
I'M DR. MARY HAMILTON.

156
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,133
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK
I'M CAPABLE

157
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:47,091
OF HURTING ANYONE,

158
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:50,878
MUCH LESS DOING THIS?

159
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,228
CHRIS?

160
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,578
- AAH! AAH!
- CHRIS?

161
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:56,927
IT'S OK. YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

162
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,147
- HELP ME!
- HEY. RELAX.

163
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,236
PLEASE, PLEASE GET AWAY FROM ME.

164
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,803
CHRIS, I'M YOUR DOCTOR.

165
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,413
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
I'M TAKING CARE OF YOU.

166
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:07,111
TAKING CARE OF ME?
YOU DID THIS TO ME!

167
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:11,376
OHH. AS I WAS SAYING.

168
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:20,211
OK. TEAM MEETING

169
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:22,605
IN THE LITERAL
DEAD OF THE NIGHT.

170
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,128
SO WHY ARE WE HERE?

171
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,609
SO YOU KNOW HOW WE HAVE
THE BATTEAM RULES

172
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:29,699
AND THE FIRST RULE IS
HOLDING EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE?

173
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:32,093
YEAH.

174
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,008
SO...

175
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,010
SO?

176
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,621
I'M...

177
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:41,450
YOU'RE...

178
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,147
OH, WOW!

179
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:44,777
I THOUGHT WATCHING
KATE COME OUT WAS TORTURE.

180
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,586
WAIT. YOU'RE COMING OUT?

181
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,763
WHAT? NO. OH. IN A WAY.

182
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:53,288
I... I'M NOT COMING OUT
BECAUSE I'M NOT GAY,

183
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:54,985
BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT.

184
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,031
MARY, MY GOD.

185
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:58,641
I'M POISON IVY.

186
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:08,738
AND I... KNOW WHAT YOU ALL
MUST BE THINKING.

187
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:13,221
"MARY, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO NORMAL

188
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:16,659
"AND COMPASSIONATE,
SO HOW COULD YOU BECOME

189
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,794
SOME PLANT WHISPERING
ATTEMPTED MURDERER?"

190
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,447
AND THEN I REALIZE
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER

191
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:26,974
WHERE I... WAS EARLIER TODAY.

192
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:29,846
IT'S BECAUSE I WAS
IN SOME FUGUE STATE

193
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,502
TORTURING CHRIS HAYNER,
WHO I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

194
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:36,200
I'M... I'M SORRY. WHAT?!

195
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:38,159
SEE, THE LITTLE WORKER BEE

196
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:41,510
IN THE HIVE, WHEN HE
CRACKED HIS EYES OPEN,

197
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:45,166
HE BLAMED QUEEN MARY FOR
TURNING HIM INTO AN EPIPEN AD.

198
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,776
THEN HE'S SEEING THINGS.

199
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,909
I MEAN, HIS EYES ARE
PRACTICALLY SWOLLEN SHUT.

200
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,693
I MEAN, HE JUST
EXPERIENCED A MAJOR TRAUMA.

201
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:54,784
OK. THEN EXPLAIN MY SUDDEN
OBSESSION WITH PLANTS.

202
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:57,395
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
YOU CARE FOR THINGS.

203
00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:00,964
OR MY SUDDEN CONSTANT,
UNQUENCHABLE THIRST.

204
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,010
YOU'RE DEHYDRATED.
MARY, YOU WORK

205
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,881
IN THE CLINIC ALL DAY AND NIGHT.

206
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,709
YOU DON'T EAT OR SLEEP.
YOU'RE ALWAYS PUTTING

207
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:08,668
EVERYONE'S NEEDS
BEFORE YOUR OWN.

208
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,148
UH, GUYS, WHY WERE
CHRIS HAYNER'S

209
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:14,325
LAST 3 TEXTS TO MARY
THIS MORNING?

210
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:15,979
AND WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.

211
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:19,069
WELL, THAT WAS
AN EXCRUCIATING PROCESS.

212
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,071
YOU KNEW MARY WAS
INFECTED BY THE VINE.

213
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:23,204
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE BEING
SO COY IN MONTOYA'S OFFICE.

214
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:25,032
I JUST FIGURED
THE LAST THING ANYONE NEEDED

215
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:27,164
WAS FOR MARY TO END UP
ON RENEE'S WALL OF WEIRD.

216
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,215
OH. MUTING THE BOSS.

217
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:35,912
I'M SURE THAT'S GONNA
END REALLY WELL.

218
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:38,175
MONTOYA DOESN'T NEED TO
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

219
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:42,658
OK. I SEE. IT'S FINE
WHEN WE THROW ALICE IN ARKHAM,

220
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,096
BUT, OH, POOR, SWEET,
INNOCENT MARY,

221
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,708
YEAH, WE SHOULD
PROTECT HER AT ALL COSTS.

222
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,060
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT ONE DOES

223
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,626
WHEN THEY REALIZE
THEY CAN CONTROL

224
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,585
MOTHER FREAKING EARTH.

225
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:59,153
I NEARLY KILLED SOMEONE,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY

226
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:02,896
OR WHEN THIS INFECTION IS
GONNA MAKE ME TRANSFORM AGAIN,

227
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,724
AND UNTIL WE FIGURE IT OUT,

228
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:07,509
I AM A THREAT TO EVERYONE...

229
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:09,076
NOT ME.

230
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:11,078
SO I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

231
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:26,833
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE
THE GIRL OUT OF THE GCPD.

232
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,358
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
THE SAME PARTNER.

233
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,881
SOPHIE MOORE.

234
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,535
ONLY A FELLOW WORKAHOLIC
WOULD ASSUME

235
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:36,320
I'D BE AT THE OFFICE AT 2 A.M.

236
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,931
THIS IS AN OFFICE?

237
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:39,497
WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED.

238
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,282
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
DETECTIVE MONTOYA

239
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:43,371
WAS ON TRACK TO BE
THE NEXT COMMISSIONER.

240
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:46,591
NOW YOU'RE SHARING A BASEMENT
WITH A LEAKY PIPE. OUCH.

241
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:49,464
AT LEAST I HAVE A JOB.

242
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,292
I QUIT THE CROWS BY CHOICE.

243
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:54,164
RIGHT BEFORE KANE'S
OWN AGENTS TRIED TO KILL HIM?

244
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,166
REAL PROFILE IN COURAGE.

245
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,734
I'M HERE TO LET
YOU RETURN A FAVOR.

246
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,606
EXCUSE ME. THEN PLEASE GO ON.

247
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,260
I'D LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME

248
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,914
OTHER THAN FLASH
YOUR CROWS BADGE

249
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,917
TO STEAL MY BEST CASES.

250
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,833
IF I WEREN'T WILLING
TO BABYSIT ALICE,

251
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,966
YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE
TO PROVE TO THE MAYOR

252
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:16,360
THAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF COLLECTING
ALL THESE BATMAN WEAPONS,

253
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:18,623
AND WE BOTH KNOW WITHOUT ALICE

254
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:21,626
NONE OF THESE CASES
ARE GETTING SOLVED.

255
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,586
FINE. I'LL BITE. WHAT?

256
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:29,330
SOMEONE EXPERIMENTED
ON MY SISTER

257
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:32,028
WITH A VARIANT OF VICTOR
FRIES' FREEZE SERUM.

258
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:34,335
I NEED ALL THE DATA YOUR
TASKFORCE COLLECTED ON FRIES

259
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:35,815
AND THAT SERUM.

260
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,227
WE DON'T HAVE HALF
OF WHAT BATWOMAN DOES.

261
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,556
AREN'T YOU PALS?

262
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,880
GO SHINE A FLASHLIGHT
IN THE AIR.

263
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,168
I WOULD EXCEPT WE'RE NOT SEEING

264
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:43,213
EYE TO EYE ON THIS.

265
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:44,954
DRAMA.

266
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:47,739
YOU WANT ME TO GET TWO STRAWS?

267
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,654
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE BLACK GLOVE SOCIETY,

268
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,221
SPECIFICALLY HIM?

269
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:54,355
THIS GUY LED THE EXPERIMENTS.

270
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:56,313
IS YOUR SISTER OK?

271
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:59,447
DO YOU ACTUALLY CARE?

272
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,579
IF YOUR SISTER SURVIVED
WHAT THEY DID TO HER,

273
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,277
THEN I'D COUNT MY LUCKY STARS,

274
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,279
AND THEN I'D FORGET
I EVER HEARD OF BLACK GLOVE.

275
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:08,064
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

276
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,066
EXCEPT THAT EVERYONE
WHO KNOWS ANYTHING

277
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,200
ABOUT BLACK GLOVE
USUALLY ENDS UP DEAD.

278
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,813
CAREFUL, MOORE.

279
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,946
THERE ARE WORSE THINGS
THAN ENDING UP LIKE ME.

280
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,474
DO YOU REMEMBER
MEETING HIM ON TWINGE?

281
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:28,606
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS ON TWINGE.

282
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,131
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS
GUY BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

283
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:34,786
ARE YOUR EYES GREEN
IN YOUR PROFILE PICTURE?

284
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,660
NO. I THINK IT'S
JUST BAD LIGHTING.

285
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,270
MAYBE HE WAS STALKING ME,

286
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:43,360
OR MAYBE HE WAS SOME
DATE RAPE GUY

287
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:45,275
AND I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT.

288
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:50,324
UH, SEEMS LIKE HE JUST
WASN'T THAT INTO YOU.

289
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,847
YEAH. ACCORDING TO YOUR DMs,

290
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,719
WHICH I MERELY SKIMMED
FOR KEY WORDS,

291
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:58,332
HE SAID YOU SEEMED "SWEET."

292
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,336
OHH! OH.

293
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:04,860
SO YOU SUFFOCATED HIM IN HONEY.

294
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,602
CLEVER GIRL. HEH.

295
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:10,213
I THINK I WANT TO
DATE POISON IVY MARY.

296
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,085
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

297
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:15,653
HOLD ON. REJECTION?

298
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,221
I ALMOST TOOK
AN INNOCENT MAN'S LIFE.

299
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:20,832
OK. MARY'S RIGHT. THAT'S
A PRETTY SCREWED UP REASON

300
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,573
TO NEARLY DROWN A GUY.

301
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:25,576
I DON'T KNOW. IS IT, THOUGH?

302
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,102
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER BEEN
ACCUSED OF BEING, UM, SWEET,

303
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:32,018
BUT, UH, IT'S BASICALLY
LIKE SAYING,

304
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:35,543
YOU KNOW, "YOU'RE PLEASANT
BUT INSTANTLY FORGETTABLE."

305
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,546
IT'S LIKE THE BEIGE
OF COMPLIMENTS,

306
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,765
- THE SWIPE LEFT OF NICE...
- WE GET IT.

307
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,291
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK THAT'S
HOW PEOPLE SEE YOU, RIGHT?

308
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:47,685
HEY. DO YOU REMEMBER GOING TO
A HARDWARE STORE THIS MORNING?

309
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,209
SHOULD I?

310
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:51,472
WELL, YOU BOUGHT
A FLOWERING POT,

311
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,778
FERTILIZER, AND A WATERING CAN,

312
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:55,519
AND ACCORDING TO YOUR
PHONE'S GEO DATA,

313
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:57,483
ONCE YOU LEFT THE STORE,
YOU WENT TO A VACANT LOT

314
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,219
IN BURNSIDE.

315
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,571
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
I HURT ANYONE ELSE.

316
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:24,853
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT MARY?

317
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,855
I WAS WONDERING HOW THIS
WOULD END UP MY FAULT.

318
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:29,336
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNEW
SOMETHING WAS UP.

319
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,946
HOW'D YOU FIGURE IT OUT?

320
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,489
UH, THE QUESTION ISN'T
HOW I FIGURED IT OUT.

321
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:33,818
IT'S HOW THE HELL YOU DIDN'T.

322
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,255
YOU'RE HER ROOMMATE,

323
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,604
YOU HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS

324
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,258
OF BATTECH AT YOUR DISPOSAL,

325
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,086
AND YOUR NUMBER TWO IS
A CERTIFIABLE GENIUS.

326
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,131
ONE OF YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTICED.

327
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,090
THE FERTILIZER BAG IS EMPTY,

328
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,788
BUT THE GROUND'S NOT DISTURBED.

329
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:51,053
NOTHING WAS PLANTED.
WHY WAS MARY HERE?

330
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,667
MARY HAMILTON, YOU DIRTY GIRL.

331
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:00,497
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

332
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,934
OH. WELL, IT'S ONLY
HER FIRST DAY.

333
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:04,806
I WONDER WHAT THIS GUY
DID TO MARY.

334
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,504
I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE TRIED
TO KILL SOPHIE AND ME

335
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,332
AND FREEZE SOPHIE'S SISTER.

336
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:11,117
SOMEHOW, MARY
MANAGED TO TURN ONE

337
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,510
OF BLACK GLOVE'S MOST
DANGEROUS OPERATIVES

338
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:17,079
INTO A, UH, GARDEN TURNIP.

339
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,603
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S
IMPRESSIVE OR JUST

340
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,301
REALLY, REALLY BAD.

341
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,780
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU HAVE A BATSHOVEL

342
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,740
IN THAT BELT.

343
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:27,089
RIGHT.

344
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,403
OH. SORRY. HOW DID I TRACK DOWN

345
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,883
AN ELUSIVE BLACK OPS
ORGANIZATION?

346
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:41,016
UH, YOU TRACKED THE P.O. BOX
VIRGIL GETTY WAS USING

347
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,452
THROUGH THE COMPANY
THAT SOLD HIM

348
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:43,932
THE CRYOGENIC MEDICAL SUPPLIES

349
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,021
THAT HE USED
ON THE FREEZE SERUM VICTIMS.

350
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,390
SOPHIE'S BEEN A
BLOODHOUND WITH THIS GUY.

351
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:49,111
I'M SURE SHE TRIED THAT.

352
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:51,853
YEAH. WELL, SOPHIE DOESN'T
HAVE AN MD AFTER HER NAME.

353
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:54,290
IT LOOKS LIKE DR. HAMILTON
USED HER TITLE

354
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:56,423
TO BYPASS PRIVACY LAWS.

355
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,294
VIOLATION OF MEDICAL ETHICS.

356
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:00,557
HARLEY QUINN, HERE YOU COME.

357
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,472
PERHAPS SOMEONE SHOULD
TELL SOPHIE

358
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,126
THAT THE GUY WHO TRIED
TO BURN US ALIVE

359
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,780
AND FREEZE HER SISTER
TO DEATH IS HANGING

360
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,608
FROM A SEWER PIPE UNDER WAYNE.

361
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:11,177
NO. WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS
WITHOUT SOPHIE FINDING MORE.

362
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,222
WELL, "MOORE" IS
LITERALLY HER NAME,

363
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,703
AND AS A VICTIM
OF SOPHIE'S BACKHAND,

364
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:17,139
I'D SAY SHE CAN HANDLE HERSELF.

365
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,533
I SAID SHE STAYS OUT OF IT!

366
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,796
OK. CAN WE GET BACK TO ME

367
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,469
FREAKING OUT OVER THE FACT
THAT I'M TURNING

368
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:26,017
INTO AN UBERVILLAIN
AGAINST MY WILL?

369
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:27,454
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

370
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,456
POISON IVY'S AN ECOTERRORIST.

371
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:31,632
NEITHER OF YOUR VICTIMS
HAD ANY PUBLIC RECORD

372
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,199
OF ACTIVELY HURTING
THE ENVIRONMENT.

373
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,852
YEAH, BUT THE BATVILLAIN WEAPONS

374
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,072
DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN
THE SAME M.O.

375
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,769
LIAM CRANDLE DIDN'T
HAVE THE SAME AGENDA

376
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:40,293
AS THE OG MAD HATTER.

377
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:41,511
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

378
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:42,904
UM, CHRIS CALLED YOU SWEET,

379
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,427
YOU DIPPED HIM IN HONEY.

380
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:45,950
VIRGIL FROZE JORDAN,

381
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:47,714
SO YOU USED MOTHER NATURE
TO IMMOBILIZE HIM.

382
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,870
SO... MAYBE
THE CHEMICAL PHEROMONES

383
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:54,785
FROM THE POISON IVY
ALLOW ME TO COMMUNICATE

384
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:56,439
WITH NATURE WHILE
HEIGHTENING THE THINGS

385
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:59,573
THAT I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT
LIKE JUSTICE?

386
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,923
WELL, SEEING AS THAT M.O. TRACKS

387
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:05,100
AND, UH... AHEM...
I KILLED YOUR MOTHER,

388
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,058
I'M REALLY NOT LOOKING
FORWARD TO BEING TURNED

389
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:10,497
INTO A CABBAGE,
SO WE SHOULD FIND OUT

390
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,455
EXACTLY WHAT TURNS DR. JEKYLL

391
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:16,198
INTO MRS. HIDE MY
VICTIMS UNDER A POT.

392
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,635
DAMN IT.

393
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,463
WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

394
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:23,553
YOU, MY DEAR,

395
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:25,860
DEAD OR ALIVE.

396
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,822
MAKING HOUSE CALLS NOW?

397
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,217
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU FOUND

398
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,653
ANOTHER POISON IVY VIC?

399
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:37,959
IT'S 5:00 IN THE MORNING.

400
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:39,482
I FIGURED YOU WERE ASLEEP.

401
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:40,938
I DON'T SLEEP, RYAN,
ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE'S

402
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:42,746
OUT THERE WITH PAM'S ABILITIES.

403
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,661
- WHERE'S THE VIC?
- IN MY CUSTODY.

404
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,141
YEAH. WELL, I NEED TO
TALK TO HIM.

405
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,099
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HE SAW,
WHAT HE KNOWS.

406
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,927
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS AT THE MOMENT.

407
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:52,016
WHEN HE'S TALKING,
I WILL CALL YOU.

408
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,714
OH. JUST LIKE CHRIS HAYNER?

409
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,499
IS THAT A COINCIDENCE
OR CONVENIENCE?

410
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,806
YOU WANTED TO PARTNER
WITH BATWOMAN, RIGHT?

411
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:01,635
THEN YOU NEED TO
TRUST MY PROCESS.

412
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:03,550
RYAN IS FLAILING.

413
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,685
WHAT DID YOU MEAN RENEE
WANTED ME DEAD OR ALIVE?

414
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:12,515
OH. RENEE AND POISON PAM
HAVE A BACKSTORY.

415
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,735
WHAT KIND OF BACKSTORY?

416
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:18,217
OH. I DON'T WANT TO BE A GOSSIP.

417
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,262
SPILL.

418
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,438
IF YOU INSIST.

419
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:26,747
SO... THEY MET,
FELL MADLY IN LOVE,

420
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,705
KISSY, KISSY, KISSY.

421
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:31,926
THEN PAM FELL VICTIM TO SOME
EVIL SCIENTIST'S EXPERIMENT.

422
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,928
OBVIOUSLY PAM'S METAMORPHOSIS

423
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:35,843
INTO "LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS"

424
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:37,845
GOT IN THE WAY OF SEXY TIME,

425
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,499
WHICH WAS A BIG PROBLEM
FOR RENEE

426
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,241
AS SHE WAS A GCPD DETECTIVE.

427
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,461
CRISIS OF THE HEART,
BORING, BORING, BORING.

428
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:47,376
ULTIMATELY, RENEE CALLED BATMAN,

429
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,943
WHO CONVINCED HER TO LURE

430
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:52,729
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE
INTO HIS TRAP.

431
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,079
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
INFECTED WITH POISON IVY

432
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:56,907
TARGET A BLACK GLOVE OPERATIVE?

433
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:59,345
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
UNLESS HE HAD

434
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,347
A PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THEM.

435
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,783
IF I KNEW, I WOULD TELL YOU.

436
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:04,872
WOULD YOU?

437
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,395
BECAUSE I'M BEGINNING
TO FEEL LIKE

438
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,484
YOU'RE HIDING THINGS
FROM ME, RYAN.

439
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:13,010
WHERE'S THE VIC?

440
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:15,274
THAT'S REALLY INTENSE.

441
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:19,365
SO RENEE SOLD OUT THE LOVE
OF HER LIFE TO BATMAN?

442
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:22,411
AND HE BURIED HER
DEEP UNDERGROUND

443
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:24,805
AWAY FROM WATER AND SUNLIGHT

444
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:28,722
TO SHRIVEL UP AND NOT DIE.

445
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:31,202
CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING
WITHOUT SKIN CREAM

446
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:33,335
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS?

447
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:34,945
IMAGINE WHAT SHE'D DO TO SOMEONE

448
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,556
SHE BARELY EVEN KNOWS.

449
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,384
OK. I THINK MARY'S HEARD ENOUGH.

450
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:41,300
WHAT? I'M NOT TRYING
TO SCARE HER.

451
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,910
IT'S JUST LIAM
ENDED UP IN ARKHAM,

452
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,433
KILLER CROC IN A CAGE,

453
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:46,522
AND NORA FRIES
WOULD RATHER FACE DEATH

454
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:48,350
OVER BEING HELD CAPTIVE AGAIN.

455
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:51,048
I JUST THINK WE ARE
DOING OURSELVES A DISSERVICE

456
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:53,747
TO DENY THE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME

457
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,183
OF ANYONE WHO COMES IN CONTACT

458
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,837
WITH BATMAN'S TROPHIES.

459
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:04,366
AS A GIRL WHO SPENT OVER A
DECADE OF HER LIFE LOCKED

460
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,412
IN A SMALL ROOM,

461
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:09,676
I JUST WANT YOU TO AVOID
ENDING UP THE WAY THEY DID.

462
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:11,852
WATCHING THE WOMAN I LOVED GO

463
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:14,463
FROM THIS COMPASSIONATE,
SELFLESS PERSON

464
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:16,422
TO THIS THING THAT COULD
JUSTIFY KILLING

465
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:18,859
DOZENS OF PEOPLE,
IT BROKE ME, RYAN,

466
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:20,904
AND NOW SHE'S INFECTED
SOMEONE ELSE,

467
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:23,516
SO TO PRETEND LIKE
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS ENDS

468
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,214
AND NOT DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER TO STOP IT,

469
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:28,434
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ME,
TO THE CITY,

470
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:31,132
OR TO THE PAM I USED TO KNOW.

471
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:35,963
SO CALL ME
WHEN YOUR GUY WAKES UP.

472
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:54,242
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT MY TRIGGER IS.

473
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:57,201
MAYBE IT'S A WORD
OR A SERIES OF WORDS.

474
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:00,161
ACTUALLY, I'M STARTING
TO FEEL A LITTLE FUNNY.

475
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:01,641
OK. FUNNY HOW?

476
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,382
MY VISION'S A LITTLE BLURRY.

477
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,774
OK. MAYBE YOU'RE DEHYDRATED.

478
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,215
RENEE'S ON MY ASS.

479
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,130
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

480
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:14,741
WE COULD ASK SOPHIE
TO ASK VIRGIL

481
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:17,352
IF HE SAID OR DID ANYTHING
THAT TRIGGERED MARY.

482
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,355
SOPHIE'S NOT WITH VIRGIL.

483
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,489
OH. HEH HEH. OOPS.

484
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:26,274
WHAT DID YOU DO?

485
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:30,191
SO... SOPHIE HAS BEEN
A GREAT ROOMMATE.

486
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:32,411
YOU KNOW, SHE PUTS
MY DISHES AWAY,

487
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,325
SHE CLEANS MY CLOTHES
WITH THAT FABRIC SOFTENER

488
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:35,979
THAT DOESN'T IRRITATE
MY SENSITIVE SKIN.

489
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:40,506
ALICE, WHAT DID YOU DO?

490
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,725
SOPHIE REALLY WANTED TO
INTERROGATE VIRGIL,

491
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:44,771
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO
KEEP SECRETS FROM MY ROOMIE.

492
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:47,382
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

493
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,992
WHAT YOU'VE JUST DONE.

494
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:52,126
SO SUE ME FOR HAVING
GUILT FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE.

495
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,824
SERIOUSLY, JUST STOP TALKING.

496
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,391
I DON'T GET IT.

497
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,175
WHY CAN'T SOPHIE KNOW
WHERE VIRGIL IS?

498
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,832
I'LL BE BACK.
CALL ME IF ANYTHING

499
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,443
CHANGES HERE.

500
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,053
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

501
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,272
TO STOP SOPHIE FROM MAKING
A HUGE MISTAKE.

502
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:23,984
HELLO AGAIN.

503
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:28,336
I KNOW. YOU THOUGHT
YOU BURNED ME ALIVE,

504
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:31,861
BUT NOPE, I LIVED

505
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,820
TO DO THE SAME TO YOU.

506
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:39,260
I'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR EMPLOYER.

507
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:41,697
WHO HIRED YOU TO TAKE MY SISTER?

508
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:47,355
LET ME REPHRASE THAT.

509
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:49,096
WAS IT JADA JET?

510
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:53,404
TECHNICALLY, I WAS HIRED
BY MARLA ELLIOT DECADES AGO.

511
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:56,799
ELLIOT. AS IN TOMMY ELLIOT?

512
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:59,802
HIS MOTHER. THOUGHT TOMMY
HAD BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS.

513
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,369
WELL, SHE GOT THAT RIGHT

514
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:03,327
SINCE HE TURNED
INTO THAT PSYCHO HUSH.

515
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:05,175
BEFORE THAT, SHE FORMED
A GROUP OF OTHER PARENTS

516
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:07,767
WITH BAD SEED KIDS,
SWAPPED HORROR STORIES,

517
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,160
DISCUSSED TREATMENTS,
MEDS, WHATEVER.

518
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:12,728
LIKE SECRET GROUP THERAPY
FOR RICH PEOPLE

519
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,991
TO TALK ABOUT THEIR
SCREWED UP KIDS.

520
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:17,994
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY SELF-HELP
GROUPS THAT EMPLOY A MILITIA.

521
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,842
THEY'RE CALLED BLACK GLOVE
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LEAVE A TRACE.

522
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:21,911
TITANS OF INDUSTRY
SPENDING MILLIONS ON R&D

523
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:23,478
TO FIX THEIR KIDS' BRAINS...

524
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,132
NOT GREAT FOR PUBLIC IMAGE.

525
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:26,960
YEAH. NEITHER IS INJECTING
TWENTYSOMETHINGS

526
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:28,396
WITH FATAL FREEZE SERUM.

527
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,050
MY CLIENTS WOULD AGREE WITH YOU,

528
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:32,013
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY WE
CLEAN UP AFTER OURSELVES.

529
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:36,273
MY SISTER NEARLY DIED!

530
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:38,145
3 OF HER FRIENDS DID!

531
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:40,843
WHY? WHAT DOES JADA WANT?

532
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:42,279
- FINE.
- ENOUGH!

533
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,502
SERIOUSLY?

534
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,286
I HAVE TO FIND OUT FROM ALICE

535
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,027
THAT YOU FOUND THIS GUY?

536
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:52,396
I SAID I WOULD TELL
YOU EVERYTHING!

537
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,596
- WHEN?
- WHEN IT'S SAFE.

538
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,294
SAFE FROM WHAT?

539
00:25:57,338 --> 00:25:59,949
SAFE FROM WHAT, RYAN?

540
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:02,952
FROM HER? FROM JADA? WHO?

541
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,519
I'M SORRY.

542
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,086
YOU WANT MY TRUST?

543
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,609
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO EARN IT

544
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,480
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE

545
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:10,917
YOU'RE TAKING
THE SIDE OF A WOMAN

546
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,875
WHO SANCTIONED MURDER OVER ME,

547
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:14,529
YOUR ACTUAL FRIEND!

548
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:18,228
NO, NO!

549
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,366
HE'S DEAD.

550
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:29,936
GUESS YOU GET TO KEEP MOMMY'S
SECRET A LITTLE LONGER.

551
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,555
WHEN BRUCE MET PAM ISLEY,

552
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,514
SHE WAS POISON IVY 24/7.

553
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:45,429
WELL, WHEREVER HE PUT HER

554
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:48,041
OBVIOUSLY CONTAINED HER, RIGHT?

555
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:50,783
MAYBE THE KEY IS FIGURING
OUT HOW HE DID THAT.

556
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,132
WELL, THIS IS BEFORE MY TIME,

557
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,786
BUT FROM WHAT HE TOLD THE PRESS,

558
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,918
HE PUT HER IN A PLACE
NO ONE WOULD EVER FIND HER.

559
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:59,661
IT DOESN'T EVEN AFFECT
YOU ANYMORE, DOES IT?

560
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,489
WHAT DOESN'T AFFECT ME?

561
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:03,336
OH. BEING SECOND FIDDLE TO
WHATEVER OTHER DRAMA'S

562
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,014
GOING ON IN RYAN'S LIFE.

563
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,886
WOW. UH, YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

564
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,994
I DON'T THINK WE ACTUALLY
NEED YOU HERE ANYMORE, ALICE,

565
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:11,194
SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO SNIFF
YOUR FLUFF AND FOLD,

566
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:12,674
NOW WOULD BE A GREAT TIME.

567
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,458
ARE NEITHER OF YOU CONCERNED

568
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:17,287
THAT OUR LEADER BATWOMAN LEFT

569
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:19,681
HER BESTIE INFECTED,

570
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:24,251
VULNERABLE, TERRIFIED
TO GO "HELP" A WOMAN

571
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:27,820
WHO LITERALLY SHARES A BEDROOM
WALL WITH A SERIAL KILLER?

572
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:30,039
- SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.
- HA HA HA!

573
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,998
OH, I KNOW SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING,

574
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:35,262
BUT DO YOU
KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING?

575
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,438
UH-UH.

576
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:40,441
SEE, RYAN DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT PROTECTING SOPHIE

577
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:42,225
FROM VIRGIL. NO.

578
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:45,185
SHE CARES ABOUT PROTECTING
VIRGIL FROM SOPHIE,

579
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:47,361
SPECIFICALLY HIS SECRETS

580
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:49,798
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE
THEY'RE ABOUT HER MOTHER,

581
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:52,148
THE WOMAN WHOSE NEEDS
SHE ONCE AGAIN PRIORITIZES

582
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,889
OVER THE BATTEAM.

583
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,936
- RYAN WOULDN'T DO THAT.
- SHE ALREADY DID, LUKE,

584
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:58,589
WHICH HAS ME WONDERING
IF IT'S ONLY

585
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,417
A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE RYAN WALTZES

586
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:02,768
INTO RENEE'S OFFICE
WITH MARY IN BATCUFFS.

587
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,247
ARE YOU JOKING?

588
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,814
RYAN WOULDN'T ARREST
HER BEST FRIEND.

589
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,270
SHE... SHE'S GONNA FIND
A WAY TO FIX THIS.

590
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:08,730
HYAH!

591
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:32,972
GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.

592
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:41,720
I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU'D COME OUT TO PLAY.

593
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:47,334
YOU FIGURED OUT SUNLIGHT
WAS MY TRIGGER.

594
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:51,730
WELL, THEY DON'T CALL ME
A SUPERVILLAIN FOR NOTHING,

595
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,949
BUT BATTY WILL BE HOME SOON,

596
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:56,473
SO I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

597
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,649
WHY ARE YOU HELPING ME?

598
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:01,870
WELL, WHY DOES
ANYONE HELP ANYONE?

599
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,829
TO ACCRUE FAVORS OWED,

600
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,569
BUT UNTIL I REDEEM THIS ONE,

601
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:08,659
I NEED YOU TO BE CAREFUL.

602
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:10,400
ONCE YOU SLITHER
OUT OF THIS BATCAVE,

603
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:12,359
RENEE MONTOYA'S GONNA
BE HUNTING YOU DOWN

604
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:15,971
LIKE A GARDNER
WITH A WEED WHACKER.

605
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:17,668
MONTOYA.

606
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:21,977
OH, HI. SOMEONE TOLD ME
TO CALL THIS NUMBER

607
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:25,807
WITH A POSSIBLE TIP
ABOUT A POISON IVY SIGHTING.

608
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,505
WHERE ARE YOU?
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

609
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,769
GOTHAM CITY BOTANICAL GARDENS.

610
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:21,254
RENEE MONTOYA.

611
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:23,473
MARY.

612
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:24,866
YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

613
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,128
IT'S NOT SAFE.

614
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:28,478
TRUST ME I'M WELL AWARE.

615
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:31,394
NOWHERE AROUND YOU
IS SAFE, RENEE.

616
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:38,532
WHO ARE YOU?

617
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:41,013
I'M THE ONE WHO
CALLED IN THE TIP.

618
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,627
VIRGIL'S DEAD, ALICE.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPP...

619
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,976
LUKE?

620
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,892
- LUKE!
- HEY. YEAH. I'M OK.

621
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:53,852
WHAT HAPPENED? DID ALICE
DO SOMETHING WITH MARY?

622
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,897
- SUNLIGHT.
- WHAT?

623
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:58,682
SUNLIGHT IS HER TRIGGER.

624
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:01,381
SHE'S NOT MARY ANYMORE.

625
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,687
WHERE DID YOU GET INFECTED?

626
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:06,777
THE PARK, THE RIVER?

627
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:08,910
WHERE WAS THE VINE, MARY?

628
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:10,259
IT'S NOT A HOMING PIGEON

629
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:12,783
FOR THE BROKENHEARTED, RAY-RAY.

630
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:14,568
YOU DON'T WHISPER,
"PAMELA ISLEY,"

631
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:16,744
INTO THE LEAVES AND FOLLOW

632
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:18,093
AS IT SLITHERS ITS WAY

633
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,052
TO HER SECRET BURIAL SITE.

634
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:21,836
YOU KNOW ABOUT PAM?

635
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,231
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT SHE
DOESN'T WANT YOU TO FIND HER.

636
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:27,363
LOOK. YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME

637
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:29,017
SO I CAN GET YOU HELP.

638
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:31,063
IS THAT WHAT I NEED?

639
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:33,892
DID YOU USE THAT
SOFT, GENTLE TONE

640
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:36,851
TO LURE POISON PAM
INTO CAPTIVITY?

641
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,594
NO. SHE WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

642
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:43,684
YOU'RE NOT THERE YET.
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.

643
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:47,514
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE
THINKS ABOUT DOWN THERE?

644
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:50,604
I MEAN... BESIDES FREEDOM

645
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:53,563
AND WATER AND HOW HER VEINS

646
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,914
SCRAPE TOGETHER LIKE SANDPAPER?

647
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:58,525
EASY. LET'S NOT MAKE THIS UGLY.

648
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:02,746
SHE THINKS ABOUT HOW MUCH
SHE HATES YOU, RENEE.

649
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,054
MARY, COME WITH ME NOW,
AND NO ONE WILL GET HURT.

650
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:09,753
OR I STAY, AND ONLY YOU DO.

651
00:32:15,455 --> 00:32:18,980
MARY, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

652
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:27,423
AAH!

653
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:32,385
MARY'S PHONE JUST PINGED

654
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:33,908
AT THE OLD GOTHAM
BOTANICAL GARDENS.

655
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,344
I NEED TO GET THERE.

656
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,887
- COMING WITH YOU.
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID

657
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:38,236
YOU WEREN'T READY
TO WEAR THE SUIT.

658
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,653
ACTUALLY, MY DAD DECIDED THAT.

659
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:41,096
I MAY NOT BE READY
TO WEAR THE SUIT,

660
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,786
BUT I'M NOT READY
TO LOSE MARY EITHER.

661
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,527
MY DAD WILL UNDERSTAND,
AND IF NOT,

662
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:46,027
I'M SURE I'LL HEAR
ABOUT IT ON THE WAY.

663
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:47,443
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

664
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:12,338
I'M READING SOME
SORT OF ENERGY HERE.

665
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:14,862
YEAH. DEFINITELY PICKING UP

666
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:16,305
ONE ABNORMALLY HIGH
THERMAL PRESENCE

667
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,431
IN THESE TREES.

668
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:21,129
DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE BEING WATCHED?

669
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,696
TINY BIT.

670
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,053
YELLOW ROSES?

671
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:34,099
YELLOW ROSES
SYMBOLIZE FRIENDSHIP.

672
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:38,233
MARY KNOWS US
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

673
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:41,236
SHE KNEW WE'D TRACK HER PHONE.

674
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,890
YOU THINK SHE WANTED
US TO FIND HER?

675
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,937
I THINK SHE WANTED
TO DRAW US OUT.

676
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:54,467
- UNH!
- AAH!

677
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,002
BATWOMAN TO BATWING.

678
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:15,183
BATWING, WHERE ARE YOU?
YOU GOOD?

679
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:19,579
ACROSS THE DOME.
MY SHOULDER'S JACKED.

680
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:33,810
SHE CAN'T BE FAR.

681
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:35,247
STAY ALERT.

682
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:43,516
HEY. WHAT'S UP, DAD?

683
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,213
NO COMMENT
FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY?

684
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:49,652
I JUST GOT MY ASS
BLOWN OFF MY FEET,

685
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:51,437
AND YOU GOT NOTHING TO SAY, HUH?

686
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:57,138
DAD? DAD, YOU THERE?

687
00:34:57,182 --> 00:35:00,185
WHAT KIND OF HERO
STILL NEEDS HIS DADDY?

688
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:04,014
EAST GARDEN.
I FOUND MARY... I THINK.

689
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:07,192
PLEASE. YOU DIDN'T FIND ME.

690
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:10,934
I FOUND MYSELF, AND HERE I AM.

691
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:13,154
WE'RE GONNA FIND A
WAY TO FIX THIS, MARY.

692
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,460
WE'RE GONNA HELP YOU.

693
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:16,244
EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING THAT.

694
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:17,637
THEY'RE GONNA HELP ME.

695
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,682
HELP ME WHAT...

696
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:23,947
BE LESS HAPPY,
LESS MYSELF, LESS ALIVE?

697
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,229
THIS ISN'T YOU, AND YOU KNOW IT.

698
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:27,690
YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME, LUKE.

699
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,388
THIS IS EXACTLY ME

700
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:33,522
JUST WITHOUT THE PART THAT
DOES EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

701
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:42,879
DAD, DAD, HELP! HELP ME!

702
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:50,974
YOUR DAD'S GONE, LUKE.

703
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,588
I TOOK OUT YOUR FAILSAFE

704
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,851
AND THE AI THAT CAME WITH IT.

705
00:35:57,894 --> 00:35:59,983
I FIGURE LUCIUS FOX'S
BRAIN COULD REALLY

706
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:02,899
OPEN UP SOME DOORS
FOR ME IN THE FUTURE.

707
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:04,379
THAT'S MY DAD!

708
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:05,641
YOU DON'T NEED HIM.

709
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:07,295
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

710
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,602
YOU DON'T HAVE PTSD.

711
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:11,560
YOU DON'T NEED A TEAM DOCTOR,

712
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:13,432
AND YOU CERTAINLY
DON'T NEED YOUR DADDY

713
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:16,174
TELLING YOU WHAT YOU CAN
AND CAN'T DO, AM I RIGHT?

714
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,657
WELL, WELL, WELL.

715
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:25,574
I FINALLY HAVE
YOUR FULL ATTENTION.

716
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:28,969
I'VE BEEN A CRAPPY FRIEND.

717
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:31,667
I'M SORRY, MARY.

718
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:37,195
FRIEND? YOU NEVER
ASK NE HOW I AM.

719
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:40,154
YOU NEVER GIVE ME
ANY OF YOUR TIME.

720
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,722
YOU GIVE MORE OF
YOURSELF TO A WOMAN

721
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,376
WHO LITERALLY GAVE YOU AWAY

722
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,421
AND SAID SHE WANTED
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU

723
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:50,033
THAN YOU DO YOUR OWN TEAMMATE!

724
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:53,776
AND THAT IS NOT FRIENDSHIP.

725
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:59,217
OK. MARY, WE NEED TO GO NOW.

726
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,306
LOOK. THESE COPS WON'T
CARE WHO YOU ARE

727
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,829
OR WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

728
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:05,397
THEY WILL JUST LOCK
YOUR ASS UP FOR GOOD!

729
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,618
- MARY, COME WITH ME!
- I'M DONE WITH TEAM SPIRIT!

730
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:12,621
IT'S TIME YOU HEARD
MY VOICE FOR ONCE

731
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:14,319
LOUD AND CLEAR.

732
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:23,066
MARY! MARY!

733
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,548
YOU'VE BEEN SO WRAPPED UP
IN YOUR OWN DRAMA, RYAN.

734
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:28,202
MARY!

735
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,552
IT'S TIME YOU GOT
WRAPPED UP IN MINE FOR ONCE.

736
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,432
ALL RIGHT. DON'T FLINCH.

737
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:48,396
LET ME HELP.

738
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,877
YOU CALLED THE COPS?

739
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,314
YOU KNEW WHO WE WERE LOOKING
FOR ALL ALONG, DIDN'T YOU?

740
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,534
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
MARY'S OUR BEST FRIEND.

741
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:57,840
NO. YOU TWO DON'T UNDERSTAND!

742
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,494
YOUR BEST FRIEND IS CURRENTLY

743
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:01,670
THE MOST DANGEROUS
PERSON IN GOTHAM,

744
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:04,325
AND YOU JUST SET HER
LOOSE ON THIS CITY.

745
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:18,513
YOU NEED A HAND?

746
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:20,254
I NEED A MARY.

747
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:30,351
I THOUGHT... I COULD
RECONNECT WITH MY FAMILY

748
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,831
AND HANDLE BAT DUTIES,

749
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:34,529
BUT... I BECAME OBLIVIOUS

750
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:36,314
TO WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MARY.

751
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,511
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
WORSE... THAT SHE FELT THAT WAY

752
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:43,321
OR THAT WE DIDN'T REALIZE IT.

753
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:46,324
SHE MAY BE INFECTED
WITH POISON IVY,

754
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:49,544
BUT THAT ANGER WAS ALL HER.

755
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:52,373
I DON'T THINK AN APOLOGY'S
GONNA FIX THIS.

756
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,070
EVERYTHING SHE SAID
TO ME WAS TRUE.

757
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:57,378
SHE TRIED TO TELL ME ABOUT
AN INCIDENT AT THE PARK,

758
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,337
AND I WAS SO DISTRACTED
WITH MY FAMILY DRAMA

759
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,427
I DIDN'T EVEN GIVE
HER THE TIME OF DAY.

760
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,342
THIS IS MY FAULT.

761
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:08,433
WHAT'S THE DAMAGE?

762
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:12,480
TORN ROTATOR CUFF. I DESERVE IT.

763
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:14,526
I DIDN'T TAKE HER WARNING
ABOUT THE SUIT SERIOUSLY.

764
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:16,832
OK. WELL, WE'RE TAKING
HER SERIOUSLY NOW.

765
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:18,399
ANY WORD FROM ALICE?

766
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:19,748
NOT YET.

767
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,620
YEAH. I TOLD SOPHIE
TO SHOOT ME A TEXT

768
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:23,186
WHEN SHE GETS HOME.

769
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,642
IN THE MEANTIME, HAVE
EVERY WAYNE SATELLITE

770
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,276
SCANNING FOR HER FACE 24/7

771
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,974
UNTIL WE FIND HER.

772
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:30,368
- OK. AND THEN WHAT?
- IT'S AN INFECTION, RIGHT?

773
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,544
WE'LL MAKE A CURE.

774
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:34,284
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE WE DO THAT

775
00:39:34,328 --> 00:39:37,810
WITHOUT OUR TEAM SCIENTIST?

776
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:39,464
