1
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:02,872
PREVIOUSLY ON BATWOMAN...

2
00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:05,527
I'M POISON IVY.
I NEARLY KILLED SOMEONE,

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,529
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
OR WHEN THIS INFECTION

4
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:09,618
IS GONNA MAKE ME
TRANSFORM AGAIN.

5
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:11,141
MARQUIS IS SICK.

6
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:12,882
THERE WAS... AN INCIDENT.

7
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:15,319
THE JOKER HAD THIS
ZAPPER ON HIS HAND.

8
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:17,365
HE PRESSED IT AGAINST
MY SON'S FOREHEAD.

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,542
AFTER THAT DAY,
HE WAS DIFFERENT, DARK,

10
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,152
HORRIFYING.

11
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:28,767
YOU FIGURED OUT SUNLIGHT
WAS MY TRIGGER.

12
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:31,727
- UNH!
- AAH!

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,207
DAD, HELP! HELP ME!

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,905
YOUR DAD'S GONE, LUKE.

15
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:37,559
I TOOK OUT YOUR FAILSAFE.

16
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:49,875
WHAT UP, SIS?

17
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:51,573
READY TO BLOW UP THE
GOTHAM BUSINESS WORLD?

18
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:53,183
WELL, WE GOT TO MAKE UP
FOR SKIPPING

19
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:55,359
THAT REBELLIOUS TEEN PHASE.

20
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,318
GUESS THIS IS WHAT
IT WOULD HAVE FELT LIKE

21
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:59,363
SNEAKING OUT OF THE HOUSE
UNDER JADA'S NOSE.

22
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:02,149
YEAH, BUT INSTEAD OF SMOKING
BLUNTS IN THE POOL HOUSE,

23
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:04,542
WE'RE PLANNING A CORPORATE
MERGER BEHIND HER BACK,

24
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,370
A TRUE FAMILY BUSINESS.

25
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:07,913
SO HOW DO YOU PROPOSE
WE MAKE THIS HAPPEN

26
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:09,523
IF YOU DON'T THINK
JADA WILL EVER GO FOR IT?

27
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:11,114
WELL, THE FIRST THING
THAT WE GOT TO DO

28
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,160
IS PROPOSE A PLAN
THAT EVERYONE LOVES,

29
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:16,032

57
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,854
GOTHAM'S BOTANICAL GARDEN
WAS THE SITE

00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,435
BUT JUDGING BY THE SIZE
OF THE VINES FOUND AT THE SCENE,

64
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,021
AUTHORITIES CAN'T HELP
BUT WONDER IF THERE'S

66
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,658

MARY IS POISON IVY?

83
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,620
WELL THAT DEPENDS.
SHE'S KIND OF GOT

84
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,005
A JEKYLL AND HYDE
THING GOING ON,

85
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,398
SO AT NIGHTTIME SHE'S FINE,

86
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,834
BUT WHEN THE SUN COMES UP,

87
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,662
THE SWEET AND LOVING
MARY THAT WE KNOW

88
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,292
TAKES A BACKSEAT TO A
VEGETATION-WIELDING SUPERVILLAIN.

89
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,361
I'M GUESSING MARY'S
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ARM.

90
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:52,928
YEAH. SHE MADE
HER POINT VERY CLEAR

91
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:54,886
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT
ME SUITING UP.

92
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,324
SHE ALSO TRIED TO SQUEEZE
THE LIFE OUT OF BATWOMAN.

93
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:58,542
NO ONE'S SEEN HER SINCE.

94
00:03:58,586 --> 00:03:59,935
IS THERE A WAY TO CURE HER?

95
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:03,112
NOT YET, BUT THERE WILL BE.

96
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:07,116
THERE WILL? HOW EXACTLY?

97
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,423
JADA HAS THE BEST MINDS
AT JETURIAN ON IT.

98
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,338
I GAVE THEM A SAMPLE
OF MARY'S BLOOD.

99
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,428
THEY'RE TRYING TO
SYNTHESIZE AN ANTIDOTE.

100
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,386
YOUR MOM DOESN'T REALLY
DO ALTRUISM,

101
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,867
SO WHAT'S IN IT FOR HER?

102
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:33,751
HOW LONG BEFORE WE CAN
BEGIN THE FREEZING PROCESS?

103
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,711
AS SOON AS MY TECHS CAN FLUSH
HIS SYSTEM OF ANY INTOXICANTS

104
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,713
OR OTHER CONTRAINDICATIONS.

105
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:40,889
PLACING A HUMAN
IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION

106
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,152
IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY.

107
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:45,546
WE DON'T WANT TO RUSH THINGS.

108
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,132
THEN THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU
THE TIME TO FOCUS

109
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,984
ON OUR OTHER PROJECT.

110
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:50,855
WHERE ARE WE WITH THAT?

111
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,205
WELL, NO ONE HAS SEEN A
PLANT-BASED INFECTION LIKE THIS

112
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:54,685
SINCE SWAMP THING.

113
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:58,167
BUT YOU CAN ERADICATE IT.

114
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,169
WE'RE SYNTHESIZING
THE ANTIDOTE NOW.

115
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,740
SORRY I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING BEFORE,

116
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:07,413
BUT I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
UNTIL MARQUIS WAS IN CUSTODY.

117
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:08,917
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE.

118
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,310
I COULD HAVE HELPED YOU.

119
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,007
HE IS UNSTABLE AND DANGEROUS.

120
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,226
I COULDN'T RISK PUTTING
ANYBODY ELSE IN JEOPARDY.

121
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,098
- I GET IT.
- WELL, I DON'T.

122
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:18,100
SO YOUR MOM GOT WHAT SHE WANTED,

123
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:19,686
AND YOU REALLY JUST TRUST
THAT SHE'S GOING TO DELIVER

124
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,059
ON A CURE FOR MARY?

125
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,539
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE.

126
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,367
JADA'S PEOPLE TESTED
MARY'S BLOOD.

127
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,953
THEY BELIEVE THE INFECTION'S
DOUBLING EVERY 12 HOURS.

128
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,588
AT THAT RATE,

129
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:29,720
THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST NIGHT
SHE'S STILL MARY.

130
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:31,940
- WHERE IS SHE NOW?
- I RAN FACIAL RECOGNITION SWEEP

131
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:33,463
OF EVERY CAMERA IN GOTHAM,

132
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,335
BUT NO PHONE SIGNAL,
NO CREDIT CARD ACTIVITY.

133
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:36,834
HERE'S TO HOPING THAT
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN

134
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,207
SHE'LL CALL US.

135
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,385
IS THAT A HIT ON MARY?

136
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,344
NO. IT'S ALICE.

137
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,041
HER TRACKER SAYS
THAT SHE BREACHED

138
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,825
HER 15-MILE PERIMETER,

139
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,392
SO SHE'S OFF LEASH
AND HAULING ASS

140
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,046
OUT OF GOTHAM.

141
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,458
YOUR ROOMMATE HAPPEN
TO TELL WHERE SHE WAS

142
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:54,310
GOING THIS MORNING?

143
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,574
I DIDN'T EXACTLY
GO HOME LAST NIGHT.

144
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,885
GREAT. SO... MARY'S IN THE WIND,

145
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:06,322
AND NOW ALICE IS
MAKING A RUN FOR IT.

146
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,108

OH. BECAUSE WE WRECKED
OUR SUPERSEXY SPORTS CAR

154
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:33,218
FLEEING THE GCPD.

155
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:36,047
ALICE, WHAT DID YOU DO?

156
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,962
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT WHAT I DID

157
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,703
BUT, UH, IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER,

158
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,226
IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

159

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,857

ALICE, STOP.

162
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,322
FINE.

163
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,506
BUT WE WERE MAKING
REALLY GOOD TIME.

164
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,246
I NEED TO CALL RYAN AND LUKE.

165
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,770
WHERE'S MY PHONE?

166
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:04,293
OH, YOU THREW IT

167
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:05,903

168
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,949

YOU MIGHT WANT TO LET

169
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:10,647
RY-RY AND HER LITTLE SIDEKICK
COOL OFF A LITTLE BIT.

170
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,170
THEY'RE BOUND TO BE SORE

171
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:16,392
FIGURATIVELY
AND, UM, THE OTHER WAY.

172
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,525
IS THIS LUKE'S BATWING AI?

173
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:21,266
OH, YEAH. APPARENTLY, YOU
JUST RIPPED IT RIGHT OFF

174
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,051
AND ALMOST TOOK
HIS ARM ALONG WITH IT.

175
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:25,314
I SINCERELY HOPE HE'S
NOT LEFT-HANDED.

176
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,146
BUT DON'T WORRY.

177
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,061
IT'S NOT NEARLY AS BAD
AS WHAT YOU DID TO RYAN.

178
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:36,064
OH, GOD. I'M GONNA BE SICK.

179
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:37,718
OH. WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

180
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:39,415
OUR NEW RIDE HAS A TOILET.

181
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,333
TRUST ME, SISTER.

182
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,074
IT'S NICER THAN THE ONE
IN ARKHAM.

183
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:56,084
RYAN AND LUKE WOULD NEVER
PUT ME IN THERE.

184
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,260
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
GAVE THEM MUCH OF A CHOICE.

185
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,392
I MEAN, YOU DID TRY
TO KILL THEM,

186
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:02,699
AND AS FOR RENEE MONTOYA
FINDING OUT ABOUT YOU,

187
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:06,311
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY THAT
CACTUS IS OUT OF THE BAG.

188
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:13,275
I'M GONNA BE A FUGITIVE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

189
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,976
NO.

190
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,198
JUST UNTIL YOU LEARN
TO CONTROL YOUR POWERS,

191
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,374
AND I'M HAPPY TO KEEP
YOU SAFE UNTIL THEN.

192
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:29,160
UHH. JUST OUT OF THE
KINDNESS OF YOUR HEART?

193
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:34,818
IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD
MENTION MY HEART ACTUALLY.

194
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:37,038
CURRENTLY, I HAVE THOUSANDS

195
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:39,170
OF CREEPY NANOBOTS RUNNING
THROUGH MY BLOODSTREAM,

196
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:43,131
SENDING OUT ANNOYING
LITTLE TRACKING SIGNALS,

197
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:47,744
AND IF THEY CAN FIND ME,
WELL... THEY CAN FIND YOU.

198
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:52,314
THOUGH YOU WOULDN'T
HAPPEN TO KNOW A DOCTOR

199
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:56,666
WHO COULD DO A FULL BLOOD
TRANSFUSION, WOULD YOU?

200
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,407
BUT THEN YOU'D GO FREE.

201
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:06,720
SOMETIMES, YOU NEED TO
PICK YOUR POISON, DEAR.

202
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,635
WHO DO YOU TRUST MORE
RIGHT NOW...

203
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:13,161
YOUR FRIENDS, WHO WILL
SURELY LOCK YOU AWAY,

204
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:17,644
OR YOUR SISTER, WHO'S
TRYING TO KEEP YOU FREE?

205
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,475
WHAT'S YOUR TYPE?

206
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:26,740
TALL, DARK, AND BROODING.

207
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,524
YOUR BLOOD TYPE.

208
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,702
O NEGATIVE.

209
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:46,300
LUKE, ON COMMS: YOU'RE ABOUT
HALF A MILE FROM ALICE

210
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,891
WEST ON I-15.

211
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,810
OH, THAT'S WEIRD.
UM, SORRY. SIGNAL'S GLITCHY.

212
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:57,292
LET ME JUST WIDEN OUT,
SEE IF I CAN GET A BETTER LOOK.

213
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,120
UH-OH.

214
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:01,035
NOT LIKING THE SOUND
OF THAT "UH-OH."

215
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:02,993
TALK TO ME, LUKE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

216
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,082
UH, ACTUALLY, I HAVE
ANOTHER TRACKER GOING EAST NOW.

217
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,171
HOW THE HELL IS SHE
GOING EAST AND WEST?

218
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,391
NO, WAIT. UH, NOW I HAVE
ONE GOING NORTH.

219
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:10,977
I'VE GOT ALICES POPPING UP
ALL OVER THE MAP.

220
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:12,699
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

221
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,265
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

222
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:36,505
WHOA. BATWOMAN? WHAT DID I DO?

223
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,116
OH. I'M A BIG FAN.
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

224
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,378
OPEN THE TRUNK.

225
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,906
NO SIGN OF ALICE OR MARY.

226
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,734
OK. WELL, I GOT ABOUT
20 OF THEM HERE,

227
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:49,407
AND THEY'RE SCATTERING
IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

228
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,693
I... I DON'T GET IT.

229
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:56,699
I DO. ALICE KNOWS
WE'RE TRACKING THE NANOBOTS

230
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,483
IN HER BLOOD,
SO SHE'S SPILLING IT

231
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,921
ON VEHICLES HEADING IN
EVERY DIRECTION ON THE MAP,

232
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:03,271
AND I KNOW WHY MARY
HASN'T CALLED US YET.

233
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,708
SHE'S WITH ALICE.

234
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,275
AND HOW WAS THE HOSPITAL?

235
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:10,713
NOT NEARLY AS SECURE
AS IT SHOULD BE.

236
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,976
I GOT IV TUBING,
BUTTERFLY NEEDLES,

237
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,283
BLOOD COLLECTION BAGS
BUT NO BLOOD.

238
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,459
AT LEAST THAT WAS LOCKED AWAY.

239
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,548
AND YET ONLY ONE
ICED CARAMEL LATTEÉ

240
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,289
THAT DOESN'T LOOK
BIG ENOUGH TO SHARE.

241
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:22,986
I NEED THE CAFFEINE, OK?

242
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,641
BEING TWO PEOPLE IS EXHAUSTING.

243
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,688
MMM. BEFORE YOU CALL ME
A SUCKY FUGITIVE,

244
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:31,081
I PAID IN CASH, AND I
DIDN'T USE MY REAL NAME.

245
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:36,739
OH. OK. WELL, GOOD WORK...
DAPHNE.

246
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,785
NOW I JUST NEED TO FIND A DONOR.

247
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:41,265
HONESTLY, I'M NOT PICKY.

248
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:44,138
ACTUALLY, PICKY IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU NEED TO BE.

249
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:47,358
YOU'RE O NEGATIVE, WHICH MEANS
YOU'RE A UNIVERSAL DONOR,

250
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:50,405
BUT YOU CAN ONLY
RECEIVE O NEG BLOOD.

251
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:56,150
HMM. SO HOW DO WE FIND
THIS, UM, SPECIAL SOMEONE?

252
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:04,549
HEY.

253
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:10,773
YOU KNOW WHAT WOMEN FIND
SO ATTRACTIVE IN A GUY?

254
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:13,558
IT'S NOT MUSCLES
OR A BIG BANK ACCOUNT.

255
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:17,824
IT'S... O NEGATIVE BLOOD.

256
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,608
- BIG TURN-ON.
- MMM.

257
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,088
SHOULD WE DO A LITTLE CHECKSIES?

258
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,524
UH, I'M GOOD.

259
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,573
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE,

260
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:30,445
BUT YOU TWO ARE FREAKING OUT
OUR CUSTOMERS

261
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:33,317
WITH YOUR VAMPIRE KINK
OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE INTO.

262
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,406
YOU GOT TO TAKE IT
OUT OF HERE NOW!

263
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:41,673
UHH. SORRY. YOU'RE KICKING
US OUT OF THIS PLACE

264
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:44,807
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE
TRYING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE

265
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:47,679
ON THE IMPORTANCE OF
KNOWING THEIR BLOOD TYPE?

266
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,466
YOU KNOW WHAT, MISS?
YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT.

267
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,730
I AM SO SORRY.
STAY AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

268
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:58,778
THAT WAS WEIRD.

269
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:02,912
OH, MARE-BEAR.

270
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,175
IT'S ABOUT TO GET A LOT WEIDER.

271
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:09,310
I THINK SOMEONE'S MIND CONTROL
PHEROMONES JUST KICKED IN.

272
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,834
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

273
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:15,229
IT'S NIGHT, AND I'M
DEFINITELY STILL MYSELF.

274
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:17,318
WELL, GET READY FOR THE
MAKEOVER OF A LIFETIME

275
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:19,842
BECAUSE THIS MAY JUST
BE STEP ONE

276
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:22,497
IN YOUR BLEND
TO FULL POISON MARY.

277
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,630
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

278
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:26,980
TAKE ANOTHER STAB AT IT.

279
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,593
HEY.

280
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:34,901
CAN WE GET A BUNCH
OF SHOTS ON THE HOUSE?

281
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:37,773
YOU GOT IT.

282
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,211
SEE? PEOPLE ACTUALLY
LISTEN TO THIS MARY,

283
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,604
AND SHE GETS FREE STUFF.

284
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:45,563
I THINK I'M GONNA LIKE HER.

285
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,957
I JUST STOLE
FROM A SMALL BUSINESS,

286
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:51,134
AND I DON'T EVEN
FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.

287
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:52,396
YEAH.

288
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:58,446
WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE.

289
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,364
AHH.

290
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:06,106
LUKE, WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
LONGER MARY'S GONNA BE MARY.

291
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:08,388
YOU'VE GOT TO GET A LINE ON
WHICH TRACKER'S THE RIGHT ONE.

292
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:10,390
BLOOD CELLS CAN LIVE OUTSIDE OF
THE BODY FOR UP TO 4-6 HOURS.

293
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:13,026
WHEN THE BLOOD CELLS DIE OFF,
THE NANOBOTS WILL SHUT DOWN.

294
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:16,333
THAT'S THE PLAN? LITERALLY
WAIT FOR BLOOD TO DRY?

295
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,031
HOPEFULLY IT'LL BE BY SUN-UP

296
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,704
SO WE CAN GET TO MARY
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

297
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:21,643
HEY. NOT TO ADD TO OUR PROBLEMS,

298
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:24,951
BUT IF SHE GOES
FULL-BLOWN POISON IVY,

299
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:28,171
THE MAYOR HAS AUTHORIZED
EXTREME MEASURES.

300
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:31,000
AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T REALIZE
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MARY.

301
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:33,785
- WHO'S THEY?
- RENEE MONTOYA.

302
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,309
WHEN DID SHE TELL YOU THIS?

303
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,835
SO SHE'S THE REASON YOU
DIDN'T GO HOME LAST NIGHT.

304
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,445
YOU WERE WITH HER.

305
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:42,945
DIDN'T REALIZE I NEEDED
YOUR PERMISSION.

306
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,753
TO SLEEP WITH THE WOMAN
BLACKMAILING ME,

307
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:47,321
THREATENING ME WITH PRISON?

308
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,018
NO. OF COURSE NOT.

309
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:52,195
I AM SO HAPPY YOU TWO
FOUND EACH OTHER.

310
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,544
UH, JUST GOT WORD FROM JETURIAN.

311
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:55,895
- THE CURE'S READY.
- COPY.

312
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,113
LET'S GO.

313
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:28,710
MAMA...

314
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:31,060
MY HANDS STING.

315
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:33,019
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

316
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,673
YOU KNOW WHY, BABY.

317
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,241
EVER SINCE THE JOKER PRESSED
THAT BUZZER TO YOUR HEAD,

318
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,678
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THE SAME.

319
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,506
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

320
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,639
I KNOW...

321
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,423
AND I NEED TO FIX YOU

322
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:48,010
BEFORE SOMEONE THAT
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT

323
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:51,820
TRIES TO PUT YOU AWAY FOR GOOD.

324
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:56,390
MAMA... I'M SORRY...

325
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59,784
FOR EVERYTHING.

326
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:01,134
I LOVE YOU.

327
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,627
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

328
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:24,026
JUST TRUST ME ON THIS.

329
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,855
HAVEN'T I ALWAYS
TAKEN CARE OF YOU?

330
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:30,815
WHEN YOU WAKE UP...

331
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:36,560
YOU'RE GONNA BE
MY MARQUIS AGAIN.

332
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:45,830
- AAH!
- RAAH!

333
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,484
AAH! UNH!

334
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,834
BACK OFF.

335
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,880
YOU WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR KILLING JADA JET?

336
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,403
I WILL KILL HER.

337
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,057
HUH YAAH!

338
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,885
WHOA!

339
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,626
MARQUIS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

340
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:04,110
DOING WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME.

341
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:05,937
TAKING INITIATIVE.

342
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,607
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

343
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:27,742
MARQUIS. HE ESCAPED.

344
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,265
- OH, MY GOD.
- HEY. TAKE IT EASY.

345
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,180
DON'T TRY TO GET UP.

346
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:33,487
I THOUGHT MARQUIS WAS ON ICE.

347
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,968
WE... WE FAILED.

348
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:38,448
WHERE COULD HE BE NOW?

349
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,363
RYAN...

350
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,148
HE WENT LOOKING FOR YOU.

351
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,290
NICE SLING.

352
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:56,031
MAKES YOU LOOK TOUGH.

353
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,728
IS RYAN AROUND?

354
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:00,253
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

355
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,081
- HOW DID YOU GET IN?
- AH. I TOLD THE STAFF

356
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,561
AT THE FRONT DESK
RYAN AND I WERE BLOOD.

357
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:10,089
HOO. 18-KARAT GOLD NIB,

358
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,307
SATIN LACQUER FINISH.

359
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:13,135
OOH! PRICEY.

360
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,138
- AND HEFTY, TOO.
- CAN YOU PUT THAT DOWN?

361
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,618
THAT WAS A GIFT FROM MY DAD.

362
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,272
AH. SHOULD HAVE FIGURED.

363
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,535
YOU KNOW, LUCIUS FOX
ALWAYS HAD THE BEST TASTE.

364
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,885
YOU KNOW, YOUR OLD MAN USED
TO COME BY OUR PLACE SOMETIMES

365
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,801
FOR MY MOM'S FAMOUS
MOSCOW MULE NIGHTS.

366
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:29,847
YEAH. WE'D SHOOT HOOPS
IN THE DRIVEWAY SOMETIMES.

367
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:33,721
- GOOD MAN.
- DUDE... GIVE ME THE PEN.

368
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:36,158
NO.

369
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,508
THERE A PROBLEM, MR. FOX?

370
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,728
YEAH. IS THERE A PROBLEM,
MR. FOX?

371
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,338
YOU CALLED SECURITY ON ME?

372
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:43,663
YEAH. YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

373
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,036
ALL RIGHT. RELAX.

374
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,299
LUKE AND I WERE JUST CHILLING

375
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:47,735
WHILE I WAIT FOR MY SISTER.

376
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:49,650
YOU MIGHT KNOW HER AS YOUR BOSS.

377
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,347
PLEASE ESCORT MR. JET OUT.

378
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,135
UGH!

379
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:06,188
HERE'S YOUR PEN.

380
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,147
UNH!

381
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,932
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT.
YOU'RE QUICK.

382
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,804
I WASN'T EVEN WARMED UP YET.

383
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,767

YOU WOULDN'T BEAT ME
WITH TWO GOOD HANDS.

388
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:29,646

395
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:50,406
YOU ARE SO AWESOME
TO CHECK MY BLOOD TYPE,

396
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,366
BUT WHY ARE
YOU CHECKING MY BLOOD TYPE?

397
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:58,632
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW.

398
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:02,244
I MEAN, IMAGINE IF YOU WERE
IN A NEAR-FATAL ACCIDENT.

399
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,985
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO
RUN THE RISK

400
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:06,422
OF BEING GIVEN THE WRONG BLOOD.

401
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:10,383
HEH. PLUS HOW ELSE WOULD
I BE ABLE TO FIND OUT

402
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,602
IF WE'RE COMPATIBLE?

403
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:16,171
OH, OK. THAT MAKES SENSE.

404
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,652
HMM.

405
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:21,916
IT'S AB NEGATIVE.
IT'S NOT GONNA CUT IT,

406
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,353
BUT THAT'S A VERY RARE
BLOOD TYPE, HIGH IN DEMAND.

407
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:26,834
YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER
DONATING YOUR PLASMA.

408
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:29,532
I'LL GO FIND A PLACE
TO DONATE NOW. OK.

409
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:33,841
MARY, THIS IS JASON.

410
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:36,626
AHEM. JASON AND I
HAVE JUST BEEN TALKING

411
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,324
ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS
TO MEET PEOPLE

412
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,195
ORGANICALLY NOWADAYS.

413
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,849
JASON HAS NO PIERCINGS,
NO TATTOOS,

414
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,285
AND HE'S NEVER BEEN TO A COUNTRY

415
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,679
WHERE YOU CAN GET MALARIA.

416
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:48,290
PLUS BONUS. HE'S A GEMINI.

417
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,205
YOU SAID THERE WOULD BE WINGS.

418
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,641
OH. TSK, TSK, TSK.

419
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,992
THAT'S BAD FOR YOUR CHOLESTEROL.

420
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,907
PLACE YOUR HAND RIGHT HERE.

421
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,609
OH. NOW I WANT WINGS.

422
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:11,226
OHH! O NEG. WE HAVE A WINNER.

423
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,662
HA HA HA!

424
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,273
WHAT'D I WIN?

425
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:19,103
YOU GET TO DONATE 2... 3 PINTS

426
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:22,019
OF YOUR BLOOD
FOR A VERY GOOD CAUSE.

427
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:24,239
HA! I'M GONNA HAVE TO
CUT YOU OFF NOW.

428
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,199
DR. TUVA DIDN'T HAVE A SUBJECT

429
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:29,810
TO TEST THE ANTIDOTE ON,

430
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,222
BUT SHE'S CONFIDENT
THAT IT WILL WORK.

431
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:32,856
WELL, THAT MAKES ONE OF US.

432
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,945
I JUST HOPE THERE'S
STILL TIME TO SAVE MARY.

433
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,295
I KNOW YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

434
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,557
I'VE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES,

435
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,385
BUT I ALWAYS KEEP MY PROMISES.

436
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:43,258
IT SHOULD BE IN HERE.

437
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:47,915
AAH!

438
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:57,141
MARQUIS...

439
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:58,839
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

440
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:04,584
OH! LUKE! LUKE?

441
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:08,544
CHILL. HE'S ALIVE. I CHECKED.

442
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:10,459
YOUR GUARD'S ANOTHER STORY.

443
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:16,770
YOUR FIGHT... IS WITH ME.

444
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:19,468
I'M THE ONE WHO BETRAYED YOU.

445
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:22,297
I GET WHY YOU'D BE UPSET.

446
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,300
I KNOW HOW AWFUL
THAT MUST HAVE FELT

447
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,346
TO HAVE YOUR SISTER
TURN AGAINST YOU.

448
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:33,003
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

449
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:34,570
HA HA HA!

450
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:37,617
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
- HEH HEH. YOU.

451
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,532
YOU THOUGHT I WAS WOUNDED.

452
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:41,621
YOU THINK I'M ALL
TORN UP INSIDE.

453
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,580
OHH. MMM. SAD FACE BECAUSE

454
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,974
MY LONG LOST SISTER
STABBED ME IN THE BACK.

455
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,933
- MARQUIS.
- HEH HEH.

456
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:52,501
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PRETEND YOU'RE NOT HURT.

457
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:54,982
RYAN, WHAT, YOU DON'T GET IT?

458
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:57,985
THIS IS ME FINALLY
NOT PRETENDING.

459
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:01,510
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BOUGHT INTO
THE WHOLE SIBLING BONDING CRAP.

460
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:05,079
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS FOR
ME TO KEEP A STRAIGHT FACE?

461
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:07,037
ME AND YOU
AGAINST THE WORLD, SIS.

462
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:08,648
HEH HEH HEH.

463
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:10,911
SO DESPERATE TO
CONNECT WITH THE FAMILY

464
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,826
THAT DIDN'T WANT YOU.

465
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:15,045
SEE, I WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT YEARS

466
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:17,265
IN THE GROUP HOME WOULD
HAVE TOUGHENED YOU UP,

467
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:19,398
BUT YOU STILL FELL FOR IT.

468
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:24,359
HA HA HA! WAIT.

469
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,448
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE RIGHT NOW,

470
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:27,971
IT MAKES IT ALL WORTH IT.

471
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:30,365
HOLD ON. LET ME TAKE A PICTURE.

472
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,019
USE THIS AS MY BACKGROUND.

473
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:35,239
- YOU'RE SICK.
- NOT AS SICK AS YOUR FRIEND.

474
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:38,504
YEAH. MOM FILLED ME IN YOUR LITTLE
DEAL BEFORE SHE BLACKED OUT.

475
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:40,636
NOT OFF THE RED WINE THIS TIME.

476
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,902
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THIS STUFF IS,

477
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:48,272
BUT BEING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE
SOLD OUT YOUR OWN BROTHER FOR IT,

478
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:50,603
I'M SURE IT'S IMPORTANT,

479
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:54,955
AND CONSIDERING THAT MOM'S
TEAM HAD A SUNRISE DEADLINE,

480
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:57,348
WELL, I'D SAY IT'S PRETTY
TIME-SENSITIVE, RIGHT?

481
00:23:57,392 --> 00:24:00,134
OHH!

482
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:04,573
OK. HEH. OBVIOUSLY,
YOU HAVE A PRICE,

483
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:07,402
SO LET'S GET TO THE PART
WHERE YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS

484
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,839
SINCE THE CLOCK IS TICKING.

485
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:12,799
ALL BUSINESS. YEAH. ME, TOO,

486
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:15,932
AND WHAT I WANT IS...

487
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,892
YOUR AUTOGRAPH
ON A RESIGNATION LETTER

488
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:20,415
OF YOU STEPPING DOWN AS CEO

489
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,418
OF WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

490
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,117
OH. I ALSO WANT ALL
YOUR STOCK OPTIONS.

491
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:28,641
OHH!

492
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,909
YOU'RE TRYING TO WAGE
A HOSTILE TAKEOVER.

493
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:38,085
YEAH, AND YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME

494
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:39,565
IF YOU WANT TO HELP YOUR FRIEND

495
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,044
IN A TIMELY FASHION,

496
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,698
AND I'D SAY YOU GOT
ABOUT AN HOUR

497
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,483
UNTIL SUNRISE.

498
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:48,748
OH. DO YOU NEED A PEN?

499
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:13,773
I REALLY WISH I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
THE CHANCE TO KNOW THE REAL YOU

500
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:15,905
BEFORE THE JOKER DESTROYED YOU.

501
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,565
SEE? THAT'S THE THING.

502
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,220
IF THE JOKER WAS SO HORRIBLE,

503
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,570
WHY WAS HE THE ONLY ONE
IN THIS DAMN CITY

504
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:30,441
WHO LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
HAVING ANY FUN?

505
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:36,099
THANKS.

506
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:00,733
LUKE, I NEED A DIRECTION.

507
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:03,257
I'M ALL DRESSED UP
WITH NOWHERE TO GO.

508
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,693
UH, GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS?

509
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:07,174
- BAD NEWS FIRST.
- OK.

510
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:08,915
MARY HASN'T USED
HER CREDIT CARDS

511
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,308
AND SHOCKINGLY
HASN'T POSTED ON INSTA,

512
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:12,832
SO I DON'T HAVE
A BEARING TO GIVE YOU,

513
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,747
AND WE ONLY HAVE 42
MINUTES UNTIL SUNRISE.

514
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,400
OK. YOU BETTER HIT ME
WITH THE GOOD NEWS.

515
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:18,577
19 OF OUR TRACKERS ARE OFFLINE,

516
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,293
- SO WE'RE DOWN TO 4.
- THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS?

517
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:21,536
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS THAT GOOD.

518
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,798
SO YOU'VE GOT A 1 IN 4 CHANCE

519
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,583
OF PICKING THE RIGHT ONE.

520
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:27,586
OK. LET ME KNOW IF
ANY OF THE TRACKERS BLINK OUT.

521
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:39,902
LOOK. I'M NOT A DOCTOR,

522
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:41,730
AND AT POINT ROCK,
MY FIELD DRESSINGS

523
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,993
WERE FAMOUSLY TERRIBLE.

524
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,390
I'M JUST TRYING TO CHANNEL
WHAT MARY WOULD SAY HERE.

525
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:53,786
SHE'D TELL ME...

526
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:59,966
SHE'D TELL ME THAT THINGS
CAN'T HEAL UNLESS YOU LET THEM,

527
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,882
AND SHE'D BE RIGHT
JUST LIKE SHE WAS

528
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:04,797
ABOUT ME AND THE SUIT.

529
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,977
AND JUST BECAUSE ARMOR
CAN COVER UP A WOUND

530
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,937
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
IT'S NOT STILL THERE.

531
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:17,070
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID
WHEN SHE TRIED TO HELP ME?

532
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,682
I PUSHED HER AWAY.

533
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:26,557
BECAUSE I JUST ASSUMED
THAT SHE'D ALWAYS BE THERE.

534
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:29,560
WELL, I TOOK MY EYES OFF ALICE

535
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:32,433
TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH RENEE,

536
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:35,131
SO IF YOU'RE HAVING
A GUILT PARTY,

537
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,872
MAKE ROOM FOR ONE MORE.

538
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:39,701
SO THAT'S HOW ALICE GOT OUT?

539
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,398
YOU AND RENEE ARE A THING NOW?

540
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,618
WE'RE NOT A THING.

541
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,055
WE HAD A THING,
WHICH TECHNICALLY

542
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,623
DIDN'T EVEN LAST TILL BREAKFAST,

543
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,758
WHICH SAYS A LOT CONSIDERING
SHE LIVES ABOUT A G.C. JITTERS.

544
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,720
THAT'S IT. COFFEE.

545
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:00,287
THAT'S HOW WE FIND MARY.

546
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,028
HOW? SHE'S NOT USING
HER CREDIT CARDS.

547
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:03,769
YEAH, BUT IF THERE'S
ONE THING THAT

548
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:05,442
A SLEEP-DEPRIVED MARY
HAMILTON CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT,

549
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:08,730
IT IS COFFEE, AND...

550
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,732
YEAH. SHE USED HER REWARDS CARD

551
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:13,300
AT A G.C. JITTERS
OUTSIDE OF METROPOLIS

552
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,650
TWO HOURS AGO.

553
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,740
THAT'S OUR MARY. LEAVE
NO REWARD POINT BEHIND.

554
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:20,829
LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW HER
BETTER THAN YOU THINK.

555
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:25,225
OK. SO THE NEAREST
TRACKER TO THAT

556
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:27,836
G.C. JITTERS LOCATION IS...

557
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,404
BROWNSVILLE PUB?

558
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:37,454
ENOUGH O NEG FOR A WHOLE HUMAN.

559
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:40,022
IT IS AMAZING WHAT TWO PEOPLE

560
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,981
WITH NARY A CONSCIENCE

561
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:44,287
BETWEEN THEM CAN PULL OFF.

562
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:47,160
I HOPE THIS GOES BETTER
THAN MY LAST TRANSFUSION.

563
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:51,033
NOCTURNA.

564
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:53,906
YOU WERE THERE.

565
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:57,300
RIGHT. YOU MEAN WHEN
YOU SAVED YOUR OWN SKIN

566
00:28:57,344 --> 00:29:00,782
BY SICCING THAT OFF-BRAND
VAMPIRE ONTO MOI

567
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,262
BY LURING HER WITH THE FACT

568
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:03,916
THAT I HAD DESERT ROSE
IN MY BLOOD,

569
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:08,485
WHICH WAS ONLY THERE
BECAUSE YOU GAVE MY MOM

570
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:09,965
THE CHOICE BETWEEN HER OR ME

571
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,968
WITH ONLY ONE CURE BETWEEN US?

572
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:16,058
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

573
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:19,235
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY,
HAVEN'T WE?

574
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,892
HMM. YOU KNOW, FOR SO LONG,

575
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:28,505
ALL I WANTED WAS FOR YOU
TO BE OUT OF MY LIFE.

576
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:30,551
I SHOULD JUST STICK
AN EMBOLISM IN YOUR IV

577
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:32,727
AND FINALLY JUST
BE DONE WITH YOU.

578
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,817
AHEM. HEH HEH.

579
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:38,124
OR, UH, OPTION "B,"

580
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,430
YOU COULD FINISH MY OIL CHANGE,

581
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:42,693
AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO
SEE ME AGAIN.

582
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:49,744
ACTUALLY, THAT'S
WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

583
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:55,097
HARD TO BELIEVE, RIGHT?

584
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:56,707
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE.

585
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,407
I KNOW THE FEELING.

586
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,807
BUT YOU WON'T BE.

587
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,506
I'M GONNA STAY WITH YOU THROUGH
THIS WHOLE MARY METAMORPHOSIS.

588
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:18,817
YOU'D BE A LOT EASIER TO TRUST
IF YOU WEREN'T A SERIAL KILLER.

589
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,862
A SERIAL KILLER
WHO HASN'T LEFT YOU,

590
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,952
DOUBTED YOU, OR IGNORED YOU.

591
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,783
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE
ALONE RIGHT NOW,

592
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,047
OR DO YOU WANT HELP FROM THE
ONLY FAMILY YOU HAVE LEFT?

593
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,671
- MARQUIS?
- HI, MOM!

594
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:49,935
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

595
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:53,721
HA! MADE YOU LOOK.

596
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:55,201
WHY ARE YOU CALLING?

597
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,767
TO TELL YOU TURN ON
THE TV TOMORROW,

598
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:59,683
9 A.M. SHARP, ANY CHANNEL.

599
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:02,121
- WHY?
- BECAUSE, MAMA,

600
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:04,558
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU SO PROUD.

601
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:19,573
BYE-BYE, LITTLE ROBO NARCS.

602
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:21,314
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
RID OF THESE LATER.

603
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:23,229
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

604
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:26,101
LIKE MY DONOR SHOULD TAKE
AN UBER HOME.

605
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:28,669
GIRAFFES OR ELEPHANTS?

606
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:31,019
ELEPHANTS. THEY HAVE
LONGER MEMORIES.

607
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:35,154
I KNOW WE WEREN'T
EACH OTHER'S...

608
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:36,807
FIRST CHOICE
IN THE SISTER DEPARTMENT,

609
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:39,071
BUT I'M, UM...

610
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:40,899
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

611
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,944
KATE WOULD HAVE NEVER
DONE THIS FOR ME.

612
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,033
HARD SAME.

613
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:47,949
KATE WOULD HAVE NEVER
LET ME DO ANYTHING.

614
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:50,691
AT LEAST YOU BELIEVED
I WAS CAPABLE

615
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:53,563
OF DOING MORE THAN WHAT
EVERYONE ELSE EXPECTS OF ME.

616
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:56,218
WELL, I'M GLAD THE NEW YOU
FINALLY AGREES

617
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:57,828
THAT EVERYONE SUCKS.

618
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:01,049
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST SIGN
OF SPROUTS,

619
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:04,183
KATE WOULD HAVE LOCKED YOU
AWAY IN ARKHAM.

620
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:10,363
YEAH. THEN SHE WOULD HAVE FELT
REALLY BAD ABOUT IT IN HER JOURNAL.

621
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:11,973
HEH!

622
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,889
POLICE! YOU'RE IN POSSESSION

623
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,282
OF A STOLEN VEHICLE!

624
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:18,153
EXIT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!

625
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:20,001
UH, THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME
TO USE YOUR PHEROMONE POWERS.

626
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:22,070
I CAN'T DO IT THROUGH THE DOOR.

627
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:23,854
YOU WANT TO OPEN UP? I DON'T.

628
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,861
STOP!

629
00:32:30,905 --> 00:32:32,515
OH, MY GOD! STOP!

630
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:36,998
I THINK WE HIT HIM.

631
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:38,522
I THINK THAT'S
A REASON TO KEEP GOING.

632
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,745
OH, THANK GOD. I THINK WE
MISSED HIM WITH THE WHEELS.

633
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,618
HE PROBABLY HAS A CONCUSSION.

634
00:32:48,662 --> 00:32:50,011
HE NEEDS A RIDE TO THE HOSPITAL.

635
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,447
I'M SURE ONE WILL COME ALONG.

636
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:52,840
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
THAT PERSON.

637
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:54,363
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM!

638
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:56,017
THE OLD YOU CAN'T LEAVE HIM.
REMEMBER HER?

639
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,734
THE ONE WHO PUTS EVERYONE'S
NEEDS ABOVE HER OWN

640
00:32:57,758 --> 00:32:59,107
AND NEVER GETS
ANYTHING IN RETURN?

641
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,327
THE NEW YOU PUTS
HERSELF FIRST, HMM,

642
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,329
AND LEAVES BEHIND
ANYONE WHO TRIES TO STOP HER.

643
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:05,026
HOBBIES INCLUDE
LONG WALKS ON THE BEACH

644
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,202
AND NOT BEING INCARCERATED.

645
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:13,426
SORRY, OLD ME.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

646
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:15,210
WE NEED TO DITCH THE NANOBOTS.

647
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:30,486
- PUNCH IT!
- CONSIDER IT PUNCHED!

648
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,053
WHOO-HOO!

649
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:39,669
HOW FAST DOES THIS THING GO?

650
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:43,847
WHY'D YOU STOP?

651
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:45,284
I DIDN'T.

652
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:57,078
SO CLOSE.

653
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:58,471
MARY, YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

654
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,909
- WE HAVE A CURE.
- A CURE? HOW?

655
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,346
IT'S A LONG STORY, BUT
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

656
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,741
IT'S PROBABLY THE LAST NIGHT
YOU'RE YOU, BUT LOOK.

657
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:10,787
THIS WILL STOP THE INFECTION.

658
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:12,354
YOU COULD BE YOU AGAIN.

659
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,269
THE OLD YOU,
THE ONE THEY CAN USE,

660
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:15,966
THE ONE THEY CAN IGNORE

661
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,446
UNTIL THEY NEED TO TROT HER OUT

662
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,621
FOR BATTEAM ASSEMBLE.

663
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,971
YOU KNOW HOW WE FOUND YOU?

664
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,582
LUKE KNEW YOU COULDN'T
RESIST COLLECTING

665
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,802
YOUR DAMN G.C. JITTERS POINTS.

666
00:34:25,846 --> 00:34:29,980
THAT'S WHAT BEST FRIENDS
KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER, MARY.

667
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:32,200
LOOK AT ME!

668
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:34,159
YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON
TO BELIEVE IN ME.

669
00:34:34,202 --> 00:34:35,943
NOW I NEED YOU TO DO IT AGAIN.

670
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:38,685
THERE THEY GO, TELLING
YOU HOW TO THINK.

671
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:40,469
I DON'T WANT TO END UP
IN ARKHAM.

672
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,210
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY.

673
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,477
PROMISE?

674
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,787
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ME
IF I DON'T TAKE THE CURE?

675
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,182
I WOULD HAVE TO KEEP YOU CONFINED
UNTIL WE FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

676
00:34:57,225 --> 00:35:00,315
WE CAN'T JUST LET YOU
HURT PEOPLE.

677
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,882
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

678
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:07,453
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

679
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:09,455
MARY, I AM TRYING TO SAVE YOU.

680
00:35:09,498 --> 00:35:11,109
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T
WANT TO BE SAVED.

681
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,023
THIS ISN'T YOU TALKING.

682
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,025
NO. THIS IS YOU NOT LISTENING.

683
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:17,245
IF YOU THINK THAT
I'M NOT MYSELF,

684
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,813
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL.

685
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,606
HA HA HA!

686
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,873
IT'S TIME I STEP
OUT OF YOUR SHADOW

687
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:40,181

690
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:14,172
SHE'S NOT MARY ANYMORE.

691
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:17,653
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE SAVED.

692
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:20,439

HAS LEFT WAYNE ENTERPRISES
VULNERABLE

699
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,515

HAVE BEEN REVOKED.

709
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:17,365
WE ARE OFFICIALLY SHUT OUT

710
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:19,324
WHAT ABOUT THE BATCAVE?

711
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,215
