1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,720
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,200
Marquis is sick.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,000
There was an incident.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
The Joker pressed

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,800
this godforsaken thing
to my son's head

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,200
and turned him into a monster.

7
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,480
I've been told that
another buzz could kill him.

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,360
I am losing my mind!

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
The hallucinations are back.

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,800
I just need a little edger
until you get me the Joy Buzzer.

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,280
There is only one buzz left.
Ryan needs it for her brother.

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,920
Your dad programmed your suit's AI
to speak with his voice?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,720
- Dad, say hello to Mary.
- <i>Hello, Mary.</i>

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,240
It's like you can talk to him again.

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,840
It seems Batwoman is a no-show.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,080
Oh, my God.
That's why Batwoman didn't show up.

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,640
She was here the whole time.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,800
I'm sorry, Mary.

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,720
What did you do?

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,840
<i>What if I were to give you
something that would make the Joker</i>

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,160
<i>wish he were you?</i>

22
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,440
Let's have some fun.

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Exactly where you said they would be,
funny man.

24
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,240
Oh, my God.

25
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,280
- What are you doing?
- Why isn't this stronger?

26
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,720
Alice, stop this.

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,200
A voltage and conductor.
They said it would work.

28
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,480
Why isn't it working?

29
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,440
- What are you doing?
- Getting Alice out of my head!

30
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,920
Alice, stop!

31
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
- That could kill you.
- Give it back!

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,240
Wait. Wait.

33
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,040
Just wait.

34
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,360
I told you I would help you.

35
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,160
I found a place.

36
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,440
It's in Switzerland.
It's near Geneva.

37
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,240
And it's called
the Weisse Kaninchen Sanatorium.

38
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,520
They specialize in childhood trauma.

39
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,680
They can help you.

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
No.

41
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,560
No more cells.

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,280
No more institutions.

43
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,440
I cannot be in my head anymore!
I want out!

44
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Please, get me out of here.

45
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,400
I can't... Please.

46
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,200
Please.

47
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,320
Please.

48
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,760
All right, Batwoman, what's the plan?

49
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,560
{\an5}How do we best handle
our one wild and precious buzz?

50
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
{\an5}Marquis showed us

51
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
{\an5}he doesn't have access
to a sliver of humanity

52
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,840
{\an5}and, thanks to Alice,
he just got control of the Batcave

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,520
{\an5}so however we get him,
it's gotta be today.

54
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,320
{\an5}And if this thing only has juice
for one buzz

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,480
{\an5}I have to be the one
to make the play.

56
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
{\an5}So we lure him close and I hit him
before he knows what's coming.

57
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,880
{\an5}Or, alternatively,
we give it to Alice.

58
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,280
Sorry I'm late.

59
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,600
{\an5}You know she just gave Marquis
the keys to the bat kingdom, right?

60
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,360
{\an5}I just came from Arkham

61
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,920
{\an5}where I found her playing
DIY electroshock therapy

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,360
with a socket wrench.

63
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,320
{\an5}She's not gonna survive
her next psychological break.

64
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,040
{\an5}We tried to help her.

65
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,960
{\an5}Alice made her bed.

66
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,120
Okay, Mary.

67
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,520
{\an5}We know you feel
a certain whatever for her

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,560
{\an5}but the buzzer created Marquis.

69
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,440
{\an5}The Joker created Marquis.

70
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,400
{\an5}And if we're splitting hairs,
he created Alice too.

71
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,200
Alice killed your mom, Mary.

72
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,520
{\an5}You think I forgot?

73
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,200
{\an5}You think I don't know how badly
Ryan wants her brother back?

74
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,200
{\an5}Or that the first time
Alice ever met Sophie

75
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,240
{\an5}she threw her
off a 30-story building?

76
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,520
I know.

77
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,960
{\an5}It is not like this is some
easy decision for me

78
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,680
or anyone.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,600
{\an5}But I believe
Alice is capable of change.

80
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,360
She just needs a chance.

81
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,080
{\an5}Each one of you looked me
in the eye a few weeks ago

82
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,280
{\an5}apologized for sidelining me

83
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,280
{\an5}and assured me I would have
a voice on this team.

84
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
This is it.

85
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,200
{\an5}This is me using my voice.

86
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,440
This is... This is what I want.

87
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,720
I need to save Alice's life.

88
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,160
I just got a live urgent message
from Marquis Jet.

89
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,360
- Me too.
- I think we all did.

90
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,520
<i>What's up, Gotham City?</i>

91
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,920
<i>We having fun yet?</i>

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,200
<i>Marquis Jet hollering at you
from a top secret location.</i>

93
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,080
<i>The time has come, the day is here,
tonight is the damn night.</i>

94
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,360
<i>I need everyone
to take to the streets.</i>

95
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,440
<i>Get out on your balconies,
jump up on your car</i>

96
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,360
<i>hell, climb to the tippy top
of your corner church steeple</i>

97
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,640
<i>because in five hours on the dot...</i>

98
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,040
<i>I'm gonna be shouting
Batwoman's true identity</i>

99
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,720
<i>from the rooftops.</i>

100
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,960
<i>Spoiler alert.</i>

101
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,680
<i>She's not the hero you think she is.</i>

102
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,080
<i>Ticktock, Gotham.</i>

103
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,800
This is really happening.

104
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,040
Marquis Jet is about to shut
Batwoman down for good.

105
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,240
<i>We are still hours away
from the Batwoman name drop</i>

106
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,040
<i>but curiosity has already pulled
some Gotham residents</i>

107
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
<i>to the streets</i>

108
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,880
<i>reacting to claims made
by Wayne CEO Marquis Jet</i>

109
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
<i>that he knows
the Scarlet Knight's secret identity</i>

110
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,560
<i>and that we should all
brace for disappointment.</i>

111
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,520
<i>No details beyond that were teased</i>

112
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,320
<i>but putting a face to the name</i>

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,880
<i>would certainly be the end
of business as usual</i>

114
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,400
<i>for the caped crusader</i>

115
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,560
<i>whose anonymity
is key to her own safety</i>

116
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,360
<i>and those of her loved ones.</i>

117
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,280
<i>While various theories
surrounding who's behind the mask</i>

118
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,680
<i>has been bouncing around
social media...</i>

119
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,360
- Guys?
- Told you she doesn't knock.

120
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,920
I take it you saw Marquis's threat?

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,200
I believe 10 million people
saw Marquis's threat.

122
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,320
How on earth did he hijack

123
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,000
every phone, TV, and livestream
in this city?

124
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,480
He got into the Batcave.

125
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,800
From there, he found the computer

126
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,000
which led to Wayne's satellite

127
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,160
which he used to override
Gotham's airwaves.

128
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,320
My dad created the tech

129
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,280
in the event that
Batman had to send an SOS

130
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,240
to every person in the city
all at once.

131
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,280
Any chance
you can trace the original feed

132
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
back to its location?

133
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,520
Without access to The Batcave

134
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,720
I was lucky to be able
to get a screen cap.

135
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,120
Well, that's not gonna help us.

136
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
What are you doing?

137
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,080
Do you remember how your father
always repeated himself

138
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,640
- when he got mad?
- Vividly.

139
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,400
- Why?
- I can hear him now.

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,200
"Jada...

141
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,880
You let my boy take on Marquis
with a smartphone and a dial-up?"

142
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,320
I'm sure my tech team can pull
a carrier-grade router

143
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
off Jeturian's server farm.

144
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Thank you?

145
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,840
We don't have a lot of time.

146
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,920
We've got to find Marquis
and buzz him with that Joy Buzzer.

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Where's Ryan?

148
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,760
That is such a good question.

149
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
Where's Ryan?

150
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,000
Right.

151
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,480
Sophie, didn't Ryan tell you
where she was headed?

152
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,400
Yes. I believe she said
she was running an errand.

153
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,880
- An errand.
- Right. That's what I remember.

154
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,560
Duh, she did mention that errand.

155
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Where was it again?

156
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Tell me why you deserve
the Joy Buzzer.

157
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,640
Shouldn't you be out
enjoying your last few hours

158
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,280
of superhero anonymity?

159
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,520
Yeah, I should.

160
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,920
Instead, I'm here
doing my best friend a solid

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,480
while the person
who actually needs it

162
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,480
is out there threatening to destroy
everything I've worked for.

163
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,920
Oh, you mean the brother
you're scared is too good to be true?

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,400
Face it, Ry-Ry.

165
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,080
You can blame Mary all you want

166
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,640
but deep down
in that little orphan heart

167
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,720
you need me to have that thing.

168
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,320
Oh, wow, Mary was right.
You did stop making sense.

169
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Or...

170
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,080
chances are
you've spent the last few months

171
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
daydreaming about what it might
be like to have a nuclear family.

172
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,120
Thanksgiving dinners,
family game nights...

173
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,400
the comfort of a kidney,
should a new one become necessary.

174
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,160
Your desperation is showing.

175
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,080
What if you zap Marquis

176
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,400
and that good little boy
buried beneath that tacky clown suit

177
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,840
turns out to be doing just fine
without his needy little sister?

178
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
Do you really want to risk
getting your hopes up

179
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,640
only to have him leave you
like everybody else?

180
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
I'm your safe bet, Ryan.

181
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,680
Psycho or sane,
you don't need me to love you back.

182
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,040
Our Stingrays
can simulate a cell tower.

183
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,720
And since our supercomputers are
too big to walk through that door

184
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
you'll need this.

185
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
A secure access point

186
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,160
to the quantum computer
at Gotham University.

187
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,720
Did you say "quantum computer"?

188
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,200
Your father had me fund
the computer lab it lives in.

189
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,400
It seems only right you use it.

190
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,920
Greg, tell Hershel to pull
the generator into the alley.

191
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,040
This processor makes the Batcave
look like it runs on a hamster wheel.

192
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
Where were all of these resources

193
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
when Jada didn't think
we had the Joy Buzzer?

194
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,880
Dibs on not being the one
to tell her.

195
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,520
Any update from Ryan?

196
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,720
Not yet.

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,720
So, what's it gonna be, Ry-Ry?

198
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
Well...

199
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,040
This was a waste of my time.

200
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,600
Have a nice life, Alice.

201
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,720
I don't deserve the Joy Buzzer, okay?

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,320
We both know
that's what you wanted to hear.

203
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
But I do have
a little piece of information

204
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,800
you're gonna need
if you wanna live to see tomorrow.

205
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,040
What are you talking about?

206
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,960
Dare I say
it's accurate to assume that

207
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,840
Marquis is harboring a...

208
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
wee little man crush on the Joker?

209
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,320
We got a hit.
Honing in on Marquis's location now.

210
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,520
- How does that make sense?
- Where are all of those?

211
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,680
His singular cell ID is pinging off
ten different shops in Gotham Square.

212
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,040
According to your brother,
when he was 7

213
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,840
the Joker jumped on his bus
and whispered his big evil plan

214
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,800
to destroy Gotham City
once and for all.

215
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,920
Unfortunately for the Joker

216
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,480
Batty stopped him
and dumped him in Arkham

217
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,080
before he could pull it off, but...

218
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,000
Curious Cathy over here

219
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,920
wandered down to the caf

220
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,600
and asked a few of the Arkham lifers
if Mr. Smiley Pants had ever

221
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,800
talked about what he had
planned on doing that day.

222
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,640
Did I ever hear
the most interesting riddle.

223
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,600
He's moving.
Just really, really slow.

224
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,480
Converting coordinates,
adding altitude...

225
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
He's not on the ground.
He's in the air.

226
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,640
So, what, Marquis took the Wayne jet?

227
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,920
Well, if the Wayne jet
moved that slow

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,200
it would fall out of the sky.

229
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,880
- No.
- What?

230
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,040
No, no, no. No.

231
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,280
What was it?

232
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,640
"Tease them with a riddle,
get them all outside.

233
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,880
What's wet and melts and isn't snow

234
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,280
but ends in genocide?"

235
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,520
This isn't about my identity, is it?

236
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,800
That was just the draw.

237
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,280
This is about the Joker's desire
to punish the city

238
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,960
for worshipping the Bat symbol.

239
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,000
It's about killing as many people
as humanly possible

240
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,720
and riddling this city with survivors
that are as ugly as him.

241
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,280
How?

242
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,040
How does one person blow up
an entire city?

243
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
He took it. It's gone.

244
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,360
He... He must've found
the location of the secret airstrip

245
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,480
in the Batcave's records.

246
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,560
What do you mean it's gone?
What's gone?

247
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
The Bat-Blimp.

248
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,560
The game's changed.
This isn't about my identity.

249
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,720
It's about luring 10 million
innocent people to their deaths.

250
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,520
In one hour, Marquis is dropping
acid bombs over the city

251
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,920
and destroying everything
and everyone in its blast radius.

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So we may be in a bar

253
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,280
dealing with the fallout
of Batman's greatest enemy

254
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,080
without a Joy Buzzer
or time to think straight

255
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,200
but we don't get excuses.

256
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
No one dies today, am I clear?

257
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,280
- Crystal.
- Good.

258
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,680
Any chance you can hack into
the controls of the Bat-Blimp?

259
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,160
I've never once seen
the Blimp's interface

260
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,120
but it's possible the coordinates
are vulnerable to an IMSI-catcher.

261
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,600
- Need a yes or no.
- I can't land it

262
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,760
- but I can probably get it close.
- Close is all we need.

263
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,920
I need you to direct it
to the GCPD rooftop.

264
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,800
Why? What are you planning?

265
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,280
So you can stop me?

266
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,800
It's that crazy?

267
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,840
Look at you figuring me out already.

268
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,000
No time for details.

269
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,960
Besides, I need you and Mary
to put your brains together

270
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,840
to get everyone in the city
to take cover

271
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,800
without inciting a chaos mob.

272
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
How? Not to throw shade
on my own sex appeal here

273
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,400
but you know I only have, like,
300 followers on socials, right?

274
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,360
The Batman Trophies.

275
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,600
Chances are Marquis cleaned house
on the Bat weapons

276
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,120
but he doesn't have access
to the wing with the trophy room

277
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,680
- without Batwoman's DNA.
- So?

278
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,240
So, between the Mad Hatter's hat
and the Condiment King's gun

279
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,440
surely there's some kooky tool
in there

280
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,080
that can influence people's behavior.

281
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,560
Okay, let's say there were.

282
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,920
How the hell
do we get into the Batcave?

283
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,720
I'm sure Marquis quadrupled security

284
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,400
since Batwing and I got busted
breaking into Wayne.

285
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,520
Jada's really not happy with me,
but I may have an idea.

286
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,640
When you said
we'd get our family back

288
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,400
I trusted you.

289
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,080
- We will get our family back.
- How?

290
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
That buzzer was the only way
to save Marquis.

291
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You knew that,
and you still gave it away.

292
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,480
Having that buzzer in our possession

293
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,880
wouldn't change the fact that
a blimp hovering over our city

294
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,160
is about to douse our streets
with the Joker's acid bombs.

295
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,040
We need to get people to safety.

296
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,360
I have connections, Ryan

297
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,920
but I highly doubt
the President of the United States

298
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
is going to take my call...

299
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,680
I don't need the President.

300
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,760
I need my mom.

301
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,840
To pick up her phone and get me
Wayne Enterprises back.

302
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,160
Do to him what you did to me.

303
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,880
If it were that simple,
I would have done it weeks ago.

304
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,800
Marquis is smart.
His accounting is bulletproof.

305
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,840
And I'm guessing he's not hiding

306
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,840
a billion-dollar vigilante fund.

307
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
No.

308
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,800
But he is hiding something.

309
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,160
The ugly truth.

310
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,440
Jada, if you do mean
what I think you mean

311
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,120
there could be serious ramifications
for you too.

312
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,160
I've risked everything
to protect my son and failed.

313
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,120
It's time I take a page
from my daughter's handbook.

314
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,160
It's time to put the city first.

315
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,000
It's never good when your CFO
calls you at martini o'clock.

316
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Yeah?

317
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Who said that?

318
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,960
You think you can fire me?

319
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,680
You and who else?

320
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,920
Oh, the DOJ.

321
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,240
That's rich.
Yeah, have fun with that.

322
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,280
<i>Marquis Jet's own mother,
business tycoon Jada Jet</i>

323
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,840
<i>just admitted
to the decades-long family secret.</i>

324
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,640
<i>Three years ago,
Franklin Jet was pronounced dead</i>

325
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,920
<i>after a fall.</i>

326
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
<i>These allegations
now throw that into question.</i>

327
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,480
<i>Meanwhile, the Wayne board has
unanimously reappointed Ryan Wilder</i>

328
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,280
<i>to the CEO position</i>

329
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,280
<i>calling her previous resignation
"coerced".</i>

330
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,560
<i>That position
would be reinstated immediately.</i>

331
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
<i>Ms. W...</i>

332
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,760
You think I care about Wayne?
Or family?

333
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,160
Or any of you idiots?

334
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,800
Don't you get it?

335
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,200
None of you matter anymore.

336
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,040
Luke, we're in. Jada's play worked.

337
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,360
Wayne Tower was post-apocalyptic.

338
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,160
So, ready to teach me how to do this?

339
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,720
Luke? Hello?

340
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,760
- <i>Batcave to Luke.</i>
- Yep, I copy.

341
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,320
Just furiously hacking into a nuclear
Bat-Blimp from a bar stool.

342
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,840
Apologies for the three-second delay.

343
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,040
Okay. I'm at the computer.

344
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,040
Tell me how Marquis
was able to hijack the airwaves.

345
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,880
Okay, are you looking at
the satellite access portal?

346
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,960
The thing with the dots
and the numbers?

347
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Let's assume yes.

348
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,880
<i>So you're going to get a prompt</i>

349
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,240
<i>then you need to claim access
to each of the satellites.</i>

350
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,360
Just click the box
next to the satellite file.

351
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,080
Okay. Clicking boxes...

352
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,600
It's kind of creepy how easy this is.

353
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,840
Well, considering
I just had to remind you

354
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
where the power switch was...

355
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Okay, team doctor, not the techie.

356
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,960
I'd like to see
one of your patient intake reports.

357
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
I missed this.

358
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,520
What, me fumbling over
this electronic paperweight

359
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,720
you call a computer?

360
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Us.

361
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Me too.

362
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,760
Okay, I'm two clicks away
from controlling Gotham's airwaves.

363
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,800
Okay, cool. What did Sophie land on?

364
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,480
The Penguin's umbrella.

365
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,880
Inducing Gotham into a hypnotic state
via eye fascination.

366
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,280
I mean, that... That's brilliant.

367
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,880
Okay. Hey, get your hypno on.
I just got into the blimp.

368
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,040
Bat Bar to Batwoman.

369
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
<i>Just landed.</i>

370
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,480
All right, I'm in.
I'm entering your coordinates now.

371
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,640
Let me know when you see it.

372
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Yeah.

373
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,120
Got eyes.

374
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,920
I love you morons.

375
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,920
What the hell was that?

376
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,400
Hey. Hey!

377
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Why did we drop?

378
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,120
I have no idea, Mr. Jet.

379
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,400
The computer changed coordinates
then locked me out.

380
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,280
- Then put it in auto-pilot.
- I did.

381
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,680
Nothing is working, sir.
It's totally dead.

382
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,440
Guess you two have that in common.

383
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,920
Luke, I need this thing
to be a lot lower.

384
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah, trying. Something happened.

385
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,400
I'm literally staring
at a ticking clock here.

386
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,280
Yeah, I lost access.
Everything just dropped offline.

387
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,480
I need some time to get back in.

388
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,960
We don't have time.

389
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,800
Wish me luck.

390
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,200
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

391
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,040
Taking the scenic route.
Lord, help me.

392
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm in the cargo hold now.

393
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
<i>What do you see?</i>

394
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,040
Please tell me they taught you
how to disarm a bomb at Point Rock.

395
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Give me eyes on it.

396
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,800
Half a dozen drums...

397
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,280
all attached to a timer that tells me
we have less than 15 minutes

398
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,360
before Marquis makes it rain acid
all over Gotham.

399
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,520
Where do I start?

400
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
You don't.

401
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,840
Okay, I was expecting something
more like cut the green or purple.

402
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,000
I count at least four trip wires
that would set this off early.

403
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,280
Not to mention
any other nasty hidden surprises

404
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,760
the Joker might have left behind.

405
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,040
<i>You touch any one of those wires,
the whole damn thing could go.</i>

406
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,800
Where the hell are we
with the evac-ing the city?

407
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,320
Just about to access
the Wayne security mainframe

408
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,600
and drop a hot tip now.

409
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,040
<i>Get underground immediately.</i>

410
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,640
<i>Take cover. Wait for instructions.</i>

411
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,800
<i>Get underground immediately.</i>

412
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,680
<i>Take cover. Wait for instructions.</i>

413
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,760
<i>Get underground immediately.</i>

414
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,560
<i>Take cover. Wait for instructions.</i>

415
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
<i>Get underground immediately.</i>

416
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,920
<i>Take cover. Wait for instructions.</i>

417
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,240
Oh, my God, it's working.

418
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Penguin's umbrella is actually
hypnotizing people to take cover.

419
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,000
<i>You hear that, Batwoman?
We're making progress.</i>

420
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,160
<i>You out of there yet?</i>

421
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,320
I'm gonna try to reroute the blimp
over the ocean.

422
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,240
Okay.

423
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,520
Tell me you learned how to wire
a blimp's controls at Point Rock.

424
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
<i>Pretty sure
"pilot a giant combustible balloon"</i>

425
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
<i>wasn't offered in basic training.</i>

426
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,480
This thing blows, the acid's still
gonna rain down over the city.

427
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,480
Once Marquis realizes
we took away his audience

428
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,240
he could trigger the bomb
at any moment with you still inside.

429
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,800
I can't just walk away from this.

430
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,560
I'm not losing you, Ryan.

431
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,680
You don't get to play
the crazy card with me.

432
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,560
I'm not losing you.

433
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,880
Nobody's ever said that to me before.

434
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,920
And nobody ever will again.

435
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,040
Should've known
you had something to do

436
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,600
with what's going on below.

437
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,640
See, this is why
I never wanted a little sister.

438
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,040
They ruin all the fun.

439
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,280
Your definition of fun
is blowing up half of Gotham?

440
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,560
Oh, why so pessimistic?

441
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,280
That means half the island lives

442
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
to remember the day

443
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,600
that the Bat-Blimp disfigured them
beyond recognition

444
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,560
and Batwoman didn't save them.

445
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,440
Disarm the bomb.

446
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,720
Everyone's taken cover already.

447
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,000
- Your plan failed.
- No, your plan failed.

448
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,800
Your plan to weasel into my life
and steal Mommy away?

449
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,720
- Hard fail, sis.
- Disarm the bomb, Marquis.

450
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,800
What is this,
your last attempt to win Jada's love?

451
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,680
You save her screwed-up son

452
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,360
and then maybe she'll apologize
for leaving you in a drop box?

453
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,160
She doesn't love you, Wilder.
Take the hint.

454
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,680
I'm not doing this for Jada.

455
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,640
Right, the hero's burden. I forgot.
You're doing this for mankind.

456
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,240
I'm doing it for my family.

457
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,200
Give me my brother back!

458
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,760
Give him back!

459
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,000
Please. I want Marquis. Please!

460
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
I'm sorry.

461
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,320
I'm sorry.

462
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,320
I'm sorry
that you're so desperate for a family

463
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,120
that you believed you could save me.

464
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,520
Batwoman?

465
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,680
<i>Ryan?</i>

466
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,240
<i>Ryan, are you there? Check in.</i>

467
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,800
Ryan? Ryan, talk to me.
Please say something. Are you okay?

468
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,440
You think I'm gonna die
before you buy me dinner?

469
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,760
- The bomb.
- We're on it.

470
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,600
It's worse than I thought.

471
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,280
Can you rewire the controls?

472
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,840
Not in two minutes.

473
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,320
I'd need to install
a whole new operating system

474
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,520
to steer this thing out of the city.

475
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
But you're Luke.

476
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,480
There's always
some super genius gigabyte-filled

477
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,960
rabbit in a hat somewhere, right?

478
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Right.

479
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
You're right.

480
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
My helmet's AI.

481
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,600
Okay. It can do that?

482
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,640
Well, my dad designed the Bat-Tech
to talk to each other.

483
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,160
The AI is the only thing that can
override this nav system in time.

484
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
If I can dock it to the mainframe

485
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,240
we might actually have
a fighting chance.

486
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,480
Wait, dock it? As in leave it behind?

487
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,760
Only way this works.

488
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,400
But, Luke, that's your dad.

489
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,360
Sophie.

490
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,200
Give me a direction I can get to
in 2 minutes and 15 seconds.

491
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,680
Copy. I'm on it.

492
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,560
Do bats have nine lives too?

493
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,040
Because I don't think
you can hold us up much longer.

494
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,000
You willing to kill me
or die for me, sis?

495
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,720
I'm not letting go.

496
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Is it just me

497
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,480
or is this evil plan
unfolding exactly as I called it?

498
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,800
Look at me doing something
out of the goodness of my heart.

499
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,960
Surprised you didn't
spontaneously burst into flames.

500
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,520
Must mean I've really changed.

501
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,920
Did this earn me the buzzer or what?

502
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,800
You're really willing
to ditch the bitch.

503
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,720
I watched my mom's head
bobbing down a river.

504
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,720
I endured a life sentence
in a monster's basement

505
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,680
and had my head scrambled
by a woman scorned.

506
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,000
And now,
I'm coming to you of all people

507
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,280
for some magic key
to make the crazy go poof.

508
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,680
That must show you
how desperate I am.

509
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,080
I don't see desperate.

510
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,720
I see a girl who lived a hell of life
capable of change.

511
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,920
I can't do it on my own.

512
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,600
No, you don't want to do it
on your own.

513
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,080
Because it's hard.

514
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,240
But if anyone can survive hard,
Alice, it's you.

515
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,240
This is for Mary

516
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,800
but deep down, Mary knows
and I know and you know

517
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
you are not the one who needs this.

518
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,760
Thank you. I mean it.

519
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,040
To be clear, we still aren't friends.

520
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,600
And I can't help you with that.

521
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,800
Okay. Less than a minute, Batwing.

522
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,560
How much longer
before it's operational?

523
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,080
AI's in. I just need coordinates.

524
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,800
<i>Sophie, now.</i>

525
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
These calculations were made

526
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,040
when we still had two minutes
on the clock.

527
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,760
What do you mean?

528
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,440
We don't have time
to get it out of Gotham?

529
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,400
<i>Batcave, I need a direction ASAP.</i>

530
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Twenty seconds.

531
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
Sophie, coordinates!

532
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Okay, 40 degrees north,
73 degrees west.

533
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,000
If we can't get it to the ocean

534
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,080
we can at least get it
to the city's most desolate area.

535
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,480
It's working. Now get out of there.

536
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,160
You inspired me to be a hero.

537
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Thanks, Dad.

538
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,320
<i>I'm proud of you son.</i>

539
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,000
<i>You and your team
will save a lot of lives tonight.</i>

540
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,480
<i>Now go save yours.</i>

541
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,240
Batcave to Batwing. Do you read?

542
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,120
Batwing, check in. Are you okay?

543
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,760
I'm here.

544
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,000
<i>I got out of there.</i>

545
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,480
Hello?

546
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,280
Hey, what are you doing out here?

547
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,680
I got split up from my mom.
I don't know where she went.

548
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,880
Okay. I'll help you find her.

549
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,760
Who are you anyway?

550
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,040
Call me Batwing.

551
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,960
How is he?

552
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,680
His vitals are stable.

553
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Physically, he's okay.

554
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,160
But until he wakes up,
we won't know if the buzzer worked.

555
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,720
It's going to work.

556
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,800
Thank you for finding a way
to make this happen.

557
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,840
I told you, you can trust me.

558
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Ryan.

559
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,720
Despite my mistakes,
you have exceeded my wildest dreams.

560
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,280
I can't change the past, but...

561
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,240
maybe we can build
a different future.

562
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,120
I'd like that.

563
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Marquis?

564
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,000
Baby, can you hear me?

565
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Hi, Mom.

566
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,280
Hey, sis.

567
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,120
Nice to meet you for real.

568
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,600
You have no idea.

569
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,880
How do you feel?

570
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,440
Like I need my little sister.

571
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,320
Seriously?

572
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,520
Good for you, Beth.

573
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,880
So, what next?

574
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,760
Well, now that we've got Wayne back,
what's next is reclaiming this space

575
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,640
as in what is up
with that tacky ass TV

576
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,200
covering my stained glass?

577
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,160
I mean, what's next for us?

578
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,120
Well, I thought we agreed
you were gonna buy me dinner.

579
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,280
Brought the champ.

580
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,240
And we're interrupting.

581
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,400
This is gonna keep happening,
isn't it?

582
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,760
- Probably.
- Probably.

583
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,440
Well, I for one am not gonna let
a slightly awkward sensation

584
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,000
get in the way of our rare
opportunity to celebrate.

585
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,560
I'm actually glad you're all here.

586
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,000
I need your help
getting this place right again.

587
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,640
Starting with this.

588
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,000
That's better.

589
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,360
So, do I wanna know
what he did to our Batcave?

590
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,320
Doesn't Batwoman take a night of?

591
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,880
This is Gotham.

592
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,840
Home of infectious reptile teeth

593
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,600
dudes in pig masks

594
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,920
a killer vine causing my bestie
to get her baddie on.

595
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,120
If I have learned anything

596
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,960
it is to be prepared for everything
at all times.

597
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,720
- Are y'all with me?
- We're with you, Batwoman.

598
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,760
Where else would we be?

599
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Yup.

600
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,280
Oh, I thought we were drinking.

601
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,160
You know what, you're right.

602
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,640
I'm just... I'll bring it.

603
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
I'll take it with.

604
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,960
Let's get to work.

605
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,560
This is Dana Dewitt,
live from the toxic scene

606
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,960
that could've destroyed Gotham City
without the heroics of Batwoman.

607
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,760
The city has advised citizens
to stay away from the area

608
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,160
as they assess
the hazardous air quality

609
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,960
caused by the Joker's acid bomb
that blanketed the neighbor...

610
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,160
Oh, my God. What is that?

611
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,760
- Oh, my God!
- No...
