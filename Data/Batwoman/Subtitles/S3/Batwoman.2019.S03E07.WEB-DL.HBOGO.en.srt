00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,480
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,920
I'm Poison Ivy.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,600
I nearly killed someone
and I don't know why

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,520
or when this infection
is gonna make me transform again.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,000
Marquis is sick.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,120
There was an incident.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,640
The Joker had this zapper
on his hand.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,440
He pressed it
against my son's forehead

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,040
After that day,
he was different, dark.

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,040
Horrifying.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,680
You figured out
sunlight was my trigger.

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,240
Dad! Help! Help me!

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,560
You dad's gone, Luke.

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,200
I took out your failsafe

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,720
What up, sis?

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,760
You ready to blow up
the Gotham business world?

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,240
Well, we gotta make up for skipping
that rebellious teen phase.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,080
Guess this is what
it would have felt like.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,400
Sneaking out of the house
under Jada's nose.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,520
Yeah, but instead of smoking blunts
in the pool house...

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,840
we're playing in a corporate merger
behind her back.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,560
A true family business.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,120
So, how do you propose
we make this happen

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,600
if you don't think
Jada would ever go for it?

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,920
Come on, the thing that we gotta do
is propose a plan

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,280
that everyone gets knows

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,440
then use the element of surprise.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,280
Whoa... What the hell is this?

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,360
Yo, what are you doing?

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,760
I'm sorry, Marquis.

31
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,680
What... what is going on?

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,200
Mom, I don't understand.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,920
It's for your own good, baby.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
-Take him.
-Yes, Ma'am.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,840
You took care of your family

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,560
and now your family
will take care of you.

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,400
Tell me more
about this favor you need.

38
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720
<i>Leaves of three, stay away from me!</i>

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,360
<i>Gotham's botanical garden</i>

40
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,600
<i>was the sight
of some horticultural hijinks</i>

41
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,840
<i>that sources say
bear a striking resemblance</i>

42
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,360
<i>to those of Gotham supervillain
Poison Ivy.</i>

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,680
<i>The toxic troublemaker
otherwise known as Pamela Isley</i>

44
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,800
<i>hasn't been seen in over a decade.</i>

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,560
<i>But judging by the size of the vines
found at the scene...</i>

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,240
<i>authorities can't help but wonder
if there's some other root cause</i>

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,440
<i>or does Gotham
need to break out its calamine?</i>

48
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,600
Mary is Poison Ivy?

49
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Oh, that depends.

50
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
{\an5}She's kind of got a Jekyll and Hyde
thing going on.

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,440
So nighttime, she's fine.

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,320
But when the sun comes out,
the sweet and loving Mary

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
that we know takes a backseat

54
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,240
to a vegetation-wielding
supervillain.

55
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,360
I'm guessing Mary
is what happened to your arm.

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,320
{\an5}Yeah, she made her point very clear
that she doesn't want me suiting up.

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,000
{\an5}She also tried to squeeze the life
out of Batwoman.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
No one has seen her since.

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,760
Is there a way to cure her?

60
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,880
Not yet. But there will be.

61
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,720
{\an5}There will? How exactly?

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,640
{\an5}Jada has the best minds
at Jeturian on it.

63
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
I gave them a sample of Mary's blood.

64
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,840
They are trying
to synthesize an antidote.

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,680
{\an5}Your mom doesn't really do altruism.

66
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
{\an5}So what's in it for her?

67
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,480
How long before
we can begin the freezing process?

68
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,680
As soon as my techs can flush
his system out of any intoxicants

69
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,440
or other contraindications.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,480
{\an5}Placing a human in suspended
animation is uncharted territory.

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,840
{\an5}We don't want to rush things.

72
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,560
{\an5}Then that should give you time
to focus on our other project.

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,440
{\an5}Where are we with that?

74
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,640
{\an5}Well, no one has seen
a plant-based infection

75
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,360
{\an5}like this since Swamp Thing.

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,560
{\an5}But you can eradicate it.

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,080
We're synthesizing the antidote now.

78
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,240
I'm sorry
I didn't say anything before

79
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,400
but I couldn't say anything
until Marquis was in custody.

80
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,600
You didn't have to do this alone.
I could have helped you.

81
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,400
He's unstable and dangerous.

82
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,760
I couldn't risk put anybody else
in jeopardy.

83
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
I get it.

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,560
Well, I don't.
So your mom got what she wanted.

85
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,240
And you really just trust that she
is going deliver on a cure for Mary?

86
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
We don't have much choice.

87
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,880
{\an5}Jada's people tested Mary's blood.

88
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,760
{\an5}They believe the infection's doubling
every 12 hours.

89
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,440
{\an5}At that rate, this may be
the last night she's still Mary.

90
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,920
Where is she now?

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,240
I've made a facial recognition sweep
of every camera in Gotham

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,480
but no phone signal,
no credit card activity.

93
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,800
{\an5}You're still hoping that when
the sun goes down, she'll call us.

94
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,280
Is that a hit on Mary?

95
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,000
No. It's Alice.

96
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,440
Her tracker says that
she's breached her 15-mile perimeter.

97
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,520
So she is off leash
hauling ass out of Gotham.

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,920
Your roommate happened to tell you
where she was going this morning?

99
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,520
I didn't exactly go home last night.

100
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,640
Great. So Mary is in the wind
and now Alice is making a run for it.

101
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,880
You don't think Mary's with Alice,
do you?

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,400
Why are we in a motor home?

103
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,400
Oh, because we wrecked
our super sexy sports car

104
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,680
fleeing the GCPD.

105
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,760
Alice, what did you do?

106
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,960
Actually, it's not what I did.

107
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,080
But if you don't remember,
it's probably for the best.

108
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,800
What do you want to listen to?
It's your turn to change the station.

109
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,800
Alice, stop.

110
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Fine.

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,400
But we were making really good time.

112
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,200
I need to call Ryan and Luke.
Where is my phone?

113
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,360
You threw it into the Gotham River
on our way out.

114
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,520
Your idea.

115
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,680
Besides, you might want to let Ry Ry
and her little sidekick

116
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,800
cool off a little bit.

117
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,040
They are bound to be sore.

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,360
Figuratively and the other way.

119
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,080
- Is this Luke's Batwing AI?
- Oh, yeah.

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,920
Apparently,
you just ripped it right off

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,760
and almost took his arm
along with it.

122
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
I sincerely hope
he's not left-handed.

123
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
But don't worry.

124
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,560
It's not nearly as bad
as what you did to Ryan.

125
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,720
Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

126
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,040
Well, you're in luck.
Our new ride has a toilet.

127
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,320
Trust me, sister,
it's nicer than the one in Arkham.

128
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Ryan and Luke would never put me
in there.

129
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,400
Well, it's not like you gave them
much of a choice.

130
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,800
I mean, you did try to kill them.

131
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,960
And as for Renee Montoya
finding out about you...

132
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,840
let's just say that cactus
is out of the bag.

133
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm gonna be a fugitive
for the rest of my life.

134
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
No.

135
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,240
Just until you learn
to control your powers.

136
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,200
And I am happy to keep you safe
until then.

137
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,040
Just out of the kindness
of your heart?

138
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,440
Funny you should mention my heart,
actually.

139
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,320
Currently I have thousands
of creepy nanobots

140
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,480
running through my bloodstream

141
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,520
sending out annoying
little tracking signals.

142
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,320
And if they can find me, well...

143
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,880
they can find you.

144
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,640
Though, you wouldn't happen
to know a doctor

145
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,960
who could do a little
blood transfusion, would you?

146
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
But then you go free.

147
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,880
Sometimes you need
to pick your poison, dear.

148
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,360
Who do you trust more right now?

149
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Your friends
who will surely lock you away...

150
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,880
or your sister
who is trying to keep you free?

151
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
What's your type?

152
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,840
Tall, dark, and brooding.

153
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,360
Your blood type?

154
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
O-negative.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,120
<i>You're about half a mile from Alice.</i>

156
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,440
West on I-15.

157
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,840
That's weird.
Sorry. Signal's glitchy.

158
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,840
Let me widen out,
see if I can get a better look.

159
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Uh-oh.

160
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,960
Not liking that sound
of that "Uh-oh."

161
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,440
Talk to me, Luke. What's going on?

162
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,200
Actually, I have another tracker
going east now.

163
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,120
How the hell is she
going east and west?

164
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,240
Oh, wait.
Now, I have one going north.

165
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,880
I've got Alices popping up
all over the map.

166
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,080
What the hell is going on?

167
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,080
Only one way to find out.

168
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,400
Batwoman. What did I do?

169
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,960
I'm a big fan.

170
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,920
- Please don't hurt me.
- Open the trunk.

171
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,880
No sign of Alice or Mary.

172
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,480
Okay, well I got
about 20 of them here.

173
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,760
<i>They're scattering
in all different directions.</i>

174
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,920
<i>I don't get it.</i>

175
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,720
I do.

176
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,440
Alice knows we're tracking
the nanobots in her blood

177
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,960
so she's been spilling it
on vehicles

178
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,000
heading in every direction
on the map.

179
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,960
And I know why Mary
hasn't called us yet.

180
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
She's with Alice.

181
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,840
And how was the hospital?

182
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,800
Not nearly as secure as it should be.

183
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,920
I got IV tubing, butterfly needles,
blood collection bags, but no blood.

184
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,880
At least that was locked away.

185
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
And yet only one iced caramel latte

186
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,360
that doesn't look big enough
to share.

187
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,840
I need the caffeine, okay?

188
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,520
Being two people is exhausting.

189
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,720
Before you call me a sucky fugitive,
I paid in cash

190
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,000
and I didn't use my real name.

191
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,960
Oh, okay. Good work, "Daphne."

192
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,880
Now I just need to find a donor.

193
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,400
Honestly, I'm not picky.

194
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
Actually, picky is exactly
what you need to be.

195
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,400
You're O-negative,
which means you're a universal donor

196
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
but you can only receive O-neg blood.

197
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,960
So how do we find
this special someone?

198
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,560
Hey.

199
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,760
You know what women find
so attractive in a guy?

200
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,160
It's not muscles,
or a big bank account, it's...

201
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,880
O-negative blood.

202
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,680
Big turn-on.

203
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,080
Shall we do a little checksie?

204
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,240
I'm good.

205
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
I don't know
what the hell's going on here

206
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,360
but you two are freaking out
our customers

207
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,360
with your vampire kink
or whatever it is you're into.

208
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,480
You gotta take it out of here now.

209
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,080
You're kicking us out of this place?

211
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,560
Simply because
we're trying to educate people

212
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,120
on the importance
of knowing their blood type?

213
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,440
You know what, miss?
You're completely right.

214
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,040
I am so sorry.

215
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,400
Stay as long as you want.

216
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,600
That was weird.

217
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,360
Oh, Mare-Bear.

218
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,560
It's about to get a lot weirder.

219
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,440
I think someone's mind-control
pheromones just kicked in.

220
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,080
How is that possible?

221
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,160
It's night
and I'm definitely still myself.

222
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,320
Well, get ready for the makeover
of a lifetime.

223
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,560
Because this may just be step one
of your blend

224
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,200
into full Poison Mary.

225
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,600
You don't believe me?

226
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,880
Take another stab at it.

227
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,000
Hey, can we get a bunch of shots
on the house?

228
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,040
You got it.

229
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,640
See?

230
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,400
People actually listen to this Mary
and she gets free stuff.

231
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
I think I'm gonna like her.

232
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,120
I just stole from a small business
and I don't even feel bad about it.

233
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,200
Welcome to the dark side.

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,160
Luke, we don't know how much longer
Mary's gonna be Mary.

235
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,200
You gotta get a line
on which tracker's the right one.

236
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,560
Blood cells can live outside the body
before for up to 4 to 6 hours.

237
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,920
When the blood cells die off,
the nanobots will shut down.

238
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,200
<i>That's the plan?</i>

239
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,240
Literally wait for blood to dry?

240
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,360
Hopefully it'll be by sun-up

241
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,640
so we can get to Mary
before it's too late.

242
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,160
Hey, not to add to our problems

243
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,440
but if she goes
full-blown Poison Ivy...

244
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,400
the mayor has authorized
extreme measures.

245
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,920
At the time, I didn't realize
they were talking about Mary.

246
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Who's "they?"

247
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,800
Renee Montoya.

248
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,160
When did she tell you this?

249
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,960
So she's the reason
you didn't go home last night?

250
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,080
You were with her?

251
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,480
Didn't realize I needed
your permission.

252
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,840
To sleep with a woman
blackmailing me?

253
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,200
Threatening me with prison?

254
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
No, of course not.

255
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,160
I'm so happy you two
found each other.

256
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,200
<i>All right. Just got word
from Jeturian, the cure is ready.</i>

257
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,320
Copy.

258
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,240
Let's go.

259
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,400
Mama...

260
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,080
My hands sting.

261
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,520
Why are you doing this?

262
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,480
You know why, baby.

263
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,920
Ever since the Joker

264
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,920
pressed that buzzer to your head,
you haven't been the same.

265
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,440
That wasn't my fault.

266
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,600
I know.

267
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,120
And I need to fix you

268
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,840
before someone who doesn't understand
that tries to put you away for good.

269
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,520
Mama, I'm sorry.

270
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,640
For everything.

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,280
I love you.

272
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,560
I love you so much.

273
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
Just trust me on this.

274
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,240
Haven't I always taken care of you?

275
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,320
When you wake up...

276
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,080
you're gonna be my Marquis again.

277
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,840
Back off.

278
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,720
Do you want to be responsible
for killing Jada Jett?

279
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,880
I will kill her.

280
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,280
Marquis, what are you doing?

281
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,480
Doing what you taught me.

282
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,440
Taking initiative.

283
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,680
What the hell happened?

284
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,600
Marquis. He escaped.

285
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Oh, my God.

286
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Here, take it easy,
don't try to get up.

287
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,760
I thought Marquis was on ice?

288
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,080
We... we failed.

289
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,400
Where could he be now?

290
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Ryan.

291
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,880
He went looking for you.

292
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,440
Nice sling.

293
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,960
Makes you look tough.

294
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Is Ryan around?

295
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,080
I don't know where she is.

296
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,600
How did you get in?

297
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,240
I told the staff at the front desk
Ryan and I were blood.

298
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,640
Eighteen-karat gold nib.

299
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,560
Satin lacquer finish. Pricey.

300
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
- And hefty too.
- Can you put that down?

301
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,600
That's a gift from my dad.

302
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Should've figured.

303
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,520
Now Lucius Fox always had
the best taste.

304
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,080
You know, your old man
used to come by our place some time

305
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,400
for my mom's famous
Moscow Mule nights.

306
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,600
Yeah. We'd shoot hoops
in the driveway sometimes.

307
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,040
Good man.

308
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,040
Dude, give me the pen.

309
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,960
No.

310
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,840
Is there a problem, Mr. Fox?

311
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,840
Is there a problem, Mr. Fox?
You called security on me?

312
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Yeah, you don't need to be here
right now.

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,080
All right. Relax.

314
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,480
Luke and I were just chilling
while I wait for my sister.

315
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,160
You may know her as your boss.

316
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,280
Please escort Mr. Jet out.

317
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,200
Here's your pen.

318
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,360
Oh, that was a good shot.

319
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,800
You're quick.

320
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,680
I wasn't even warmed up yet.

321
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,360
Don't lie to yourself.

322
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,240
You wouldn't beat me
with two good hands.

323
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,240
You ready to wave the white flag?

324
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
Goodnight.

325
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
You're so awesome
to check my blood type.

326
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,000
But why are you checking
my blood type?

327
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,600
Because it's important to know.

328
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,680
I mean, imagine if you were in
a near-fatal accident.

329
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,840
You wouldn't want to run the risk
of being given the wrong blood.

330
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,880
Plus, how else would I be able
to find out if we're compatible?

331
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,120
Oh, okay. That makes sense.

332
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,440
It's AB negative.
That's not gonna cut it.

333
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,520
But that's a very rare blood type,
high in demand.

334
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,680
You should really consider donating
your plasma.

335
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,600
I'll go find a place to donate now.

336
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,240
Mary, this is Jason.

337
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,960
Jason and I have just been talking
about how hard it is

338
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,440
to meet people "organically"
nowadays.

339
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,120
Jason has no piercings, no tattoos

340
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,240
and he's never been to a country
where you can get Malaria.

341
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,760
Plus bonus, he's a Gemini.

342
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,640
You said there would be wings.

343
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,640
That's bad for your cholesterol.

344
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,000
Place your hand right here.

345
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,240
Now I want wings.

346
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,440
O-neg. We have a winner.

347
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,080
What did I win?

348
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,200
You get to donate two...

349
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,000
three pints of your blood
for a very good cause.

350
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm gonna have to cut you off now.

351
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,800
Dr. Tuva didn't have a subject
to test the antidote on

352
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,240
but she's confident it will work.

353
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,440
Well, that makes one of us.

354
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,240
I just hope there's still time
to save Mary.

355
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,400
I know you don't trust me.
I've made a lot of mistakes.

356
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,960
But I always keep my promises.

357
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,600
It should be in here.

358
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,120
Marquis.

359
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,960
What have you done?

360
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,720
Luke.

361
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,000
Chill.

362
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
He's alive. I checked.

363
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,240
Your guard's another story.

364
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,880
Your fight is with me.

365
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,320
I'm the one who betrayed you.

366
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,360
I get why you'd be upset.

367
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,040
I know how awful that must have felt
to have your sister turn against you.

368
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,040
- What's so funny?
- You.

369
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,200
You thought I was wounded?

370
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,680
You think I'm all torn up inside?

371
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,160
Sad face because my long-lost sister
stabbed me in the back?

372
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,320
Marquis.

373
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,160
You don't have to pretend
you're not hurt.

374
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,120
Ryan, what, you don't get it?

375
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,160
This is me finally not pretending.

376
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,440
I can't believe you bought in
to the whole "sibling bonding" crap.

377
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,160
You know how hard it was for me
to keep a straight face?

378
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,040
Me and you against the world, sis.

379
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,960
So desperate to connect
with the family that didn't want you.

380
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,640
See, I would've thought that years
in the group home

381
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,120
would've toughened you up.

382
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,080
But you still fell for it.

383
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,440
Wait.

384
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,800
The look on your face right now,
it makes it all worth it.

385
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,440
Hold on. I'll take a picture.

386
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,720
- Use this as my background.
- You're sick.

387
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,080
Not as sick as your friend.

388
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,120
Yeah, Mom filled me in
on your little deal

389
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,440
before she blacked out.

390
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,240
Not off the red wine this time.

391
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,320
I don't even know what this stuff is,

392
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,440
but being that would have sold out
your own brother for it,

393
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,960
I'm sure it's important.

394
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,440
And considering that Mom's team

395
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,280
had a sunrise deadline, I'd say
it's pretty time sensitive, right?

396
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,760
Okay. Obviously you have a price.

397
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,320
So let's get to the part
where you tell me what it is

398
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,040
since the clock is ticking.

399
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,400
All business.

400
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,760
Yeah, me too.

401
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,160
And what I want is...

402
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,120
your autograph.

403
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,440
On a resignation letter of you

404
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,840
stepping down as CEO
of Wayne Enterprises.

405
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,240
I also want all your stock options.

406
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,920
You're trying to wage
a hostile takeover.

407
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,280
Yeah, and you're gonna help me.

408
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,880
If you wanna help your friend
in a timely fashion

409
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,200
and I'd say you got about
an hour until sunrise.

410
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,360
Do you need a pen?

411
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,360
I really wish I would've gotten
the chance to know the real you.

412
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,640
Before the Joker destroyed you.

413
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,280
See?

414
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,160
That's the thing.

415
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,680
If the Joker was so horrible...

416
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,400
why was he the only one
in this damn city

417
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,280
who looked like he was having
any fun?

418
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,880
Thanks.

419
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,800
Luke, I need a direction.

420
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
I'm all dressed up
with nowhere to go.

421
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,600
Good news, bad news.

422
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,880
<i>Bad news first.</i>

423
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Okay.

424
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,200
Mary hasn't used her credit cards

425
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,480
and shockingly hasn't posted
on Insta.

426
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,000
So I don't have a bearing
to give you.

427
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,040
And we only have 42 minutes
until sunrise.

428
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,640
Okay. You better hit me
with the good news.

429
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,280
Nineteen of our trackers are offline,
so we're down to four.

430
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,600
That's the good news?

431
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,800
Didn't say it was that good.

432
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,080
So you got a one-in-four chance
of picking the right one.

433
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
Okay.

434
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,520
Let me know if any of the trackers
blink out.

435
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,120
Look, I'm not a doctor.

436
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,560
And at Point Rock, my field dressings
were famously terrible.

437
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,040
I'm just trying to channel
what Mary would say here.

438
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,840
She'd tell me...

439
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,000
She'd tell me that things can't heal
unless you let them.

440
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,640
And she'd be right.

441
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,600
Just like she was about me
and the suit.

442
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,520
And just because armor can cover up
a wound...

443
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,120
doesn't mean that it's not
still there.

444
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,920
You know what I did
when she tried to help me?

445
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,520
I pushed her away.

446
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,280
Because I just assumed
that she'd always be there.

447
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,560
Well, I took my eyes off Alice

448
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,280
to spend the night with Renee.

449
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,400
So if you're having a guilt party...

450
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,800
make room for one more.

451
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,840
So that's how Alice got out?

452
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,080
You and Renee are a thing now?

453
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,960
We're not a thing.

454
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,040
We had a thing, which technically
didn't even last until breakfast

455
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,520
which says a lot, considering
she lives above a GC Jitters.

456
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,480
That's it.

457
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,760
Coffee. That's how we find Mary.

458
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,240
How?
She's not using her credit cards.

459
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,880
Yeah, but if there's one thing
that a sleep-deprived Mary Hamilton

460
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,400
cannot live without, it is coffee.

461
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
And...

462
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,320
Yeah, she used her rewards card
at a GC Jitters

463
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,200
outside the Metropolis two hours ago.

464
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
That's our Mary.

465
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,240
Leave no reward point behind.

466
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
Looks like you know her better
than you think.

467
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,280
Okay, so...

468
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,120
The nearest tracker
to that GC Jitters location is...

469
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Brownsville Pub?

470
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,680
Enough O-neg for a whole human.

471
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,600
It is amazing what two people
with nary conscience

472
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,040
between them can pull off.

473
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,800
I hope this goes better
than my last transfusion.

474
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,240
Nocturna?

475
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,720
You were there?

476
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Right.

477
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,400
You mean when you saved your own skin

478
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,880
by siccing that off-brand vampire
on to <i>moi.</i>

479
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,920
By luring her with the fact
that I had Desert Rose in my blood

480
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,560
which was only there
because you gave my mom

481
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,720
the choice between her or me
with only one cure between us.

482
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Yeah, I remember.

483
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
We've come a long way, haven't we?

484
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,960
Yeah.

485
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,600
For so long, all I wanted is you
to be out of my life.

486
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,800
I should just stick an embolism
in your IV

487
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,360
and finally just be done with you.

488
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,320
Or, option B,
you could finish my oil change

489
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,160
and you will never have
to see me again.

490
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,320
Actually, that's what I'm afraid of.

491
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,040
Hard to believe, right?

492
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,760
You don't want to be alone.

493
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,280
I know the feeling.

494
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,000
But you won't be.

495
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,120
I'm gonna stay with you through
this whole Mary metamorphosis.

496
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,480
You'd be a lot easier to trust
if you weren't a serial killer.

497
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,760
A serial killer who hasn't left you,
doubted you, or ignored you.

498
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,720
Do you really wanna
be alone right now?

499
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,760
Or do you want the help from
the only family you have left?

500
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,800
- Marquis?
<i>- Hi, mom.</i>

501
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,800
- Where are you?
<i>- Right behind you.</i>

502
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,800
<i>Made you look.</i>

503
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
Why are you calling?

504
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,800
<i>To tell you to turn
on the TV tomorrow.</i>

505
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,920
<i>9.00am sharp. Any channel.</i>

506
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,080
Why?

507
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,360
<i>Because, Mama,
I'm gonna make you so proud.</i>

508
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,880
Bye-bye, little robo-narcs.

509
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,000
I got to get out of these later.

510
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,240
How are you feeling?

511
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,440
Like my donor
should take an Uber home.

512
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,800
Giraffes or elephants?

513
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,920
Elephants.
They have longer memories.

514
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
I know we weren't
each other's first choice

515
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
in the sister department,
but I'm...

516
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,560
I'm really glad you're here.

517
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,800
Kate would've never done this
for me.

518
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,320
Hard same.

519
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,600
Kate would've never
let me do anything.

520
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,920
At least,
you believed I was capable

521
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,720
of doing more than
what everyone else expects of me.

522
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,000
Well, I'm glad the new you

523
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,640
finally agrees that everyone sucks.

524
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,120
You know, the first sign of sprouts,
Kate would've locked you away

525
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
in Arkham.

526
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,800
Yeah.

527
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,440
Then. she would've felt
really bad about it

528
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,600
in her journal.

529
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,200
Police. You're in possession
of a stolen vehicle.

530
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,640
Exit with your hands up.

531
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,840
This would be a good time
to use those pheromone powers.

532
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,880
I can't do it through the door.

533
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
You wanna open up?

534
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,080
I don't.

535
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,720
Stop!

536
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
Oh, my God! Stop!

537
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,800
I think we hit him.

538
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,520
I think that's a reason
to keep going.

539
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,520
Thank God.

540
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,200
I think we missed him
with the wheels.

541
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,760
He probably has a concussion.
He needs a ride to the hospital.

542
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,280
I'm sure one will come along.

543
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,480
You don't need to be that person.

544
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,240
I can't just leave him.

545
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,760
Old you can't leave him.
Remember her?

546
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,560
The one who always put everyone
else's needs above her own

547
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,320
and never gets anything in return?

548
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,320
New you puts herself first
and leaves behind anyone

549
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,600
who tries to stop her.

550
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,040
Hobbies include
long walks on the beach

551
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,000
and not being incarcerated.

552
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,320
Sorry, old me. Let's get out of here.

553
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,040
We need to ditch the nano-bots.

554
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,600
- Punch it!
- Consider it punched.

555
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,560
How fast can this thing go?

556
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,920
Why'd you stop?

557
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I didn't.

558
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,080
So close.

559
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,520
Mary, you're gonna be fine.
We have a cure.

560
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,080
A cure? How?

561
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,720
It's a long story,
but we are running out of time.

562
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,320
This is probably
the last night you're you.

563
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,000
But look,
this will stop the infection.

564
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,440
- You can be you again.
- The old you.

565
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,080
The one they can use,
the one they can ignore

566
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,800
until they need to trot her out
for "Bat Team, Assemble."

567
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,160
Do you know how we found you?

568
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,320
Luke knew you couldn't resist

569
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,560
collecting your damn
GC Jitters points.

570
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,240
That's what best friends
know about each other, Mary.

571
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Look at me!

572
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,440
You were the first person
to believe in me.

573
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,960
Now I need you to do it again.

574
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,360
There they go.
Telling you how to think.

575
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,560
I don't want to end up in Arkham.

576
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,080
It doesn't have to be that way.

577
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,520
Promise?

578
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,280
What will you do to me
if I don't take the cure?

579
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,920
I would have to keep you confined
until we figure something out.

580
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,200
We can't just let you
hurt people.

581
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
That's what I thought.

582
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,280
What did you do to me?

583
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,600
Mary, I'm trying to save you.

584
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,280
Well, maybe I don't want to be saved.

585
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,680
This isn't you talking.

586
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,400
No. This is you not listening.

587
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,440
If you think that I'm not myself,
then you don't know me at all.

588
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,560
It's time I step out of your shadow
and into my own sunlight.

589
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Where's Mary?

590
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,040
She's not Mary anymore.

591
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,680
She didn't want to be saved.

592
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,760
Well, we're not giving up on her.

593
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,120
You don't get it.

594
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,000
I think she's given up on us.

595
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,360
All of Gotham is rocked
by this stunning new development.

596
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,680
The surprise resignation
of CEO Ryan Wilder

597
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,360
has left Wayne Enterprises
vulnerable to a hostile takeover.

598
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,680
What this means
for this legendary pillar

599
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,640
of Gotham City is still a mystery.

600
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,480
<i>But we are standing by here
at Wayne Tower</i>

601
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,880
<i>where we are told
the new CEO of Wayne Enterprises</i>

602
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,640
<i>will be making a statement shortly.</i>

603
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,320
Now you know why the Batmobile's
parked at a meter.

604
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,920
News vans
completely blocking the garage.

605
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,800
You wouldn't have been able
to get in anyway.

606
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,200
Our security clearances
have been revoked.

607
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,520
We're completely shut out
of Wayne Tower.

608
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,720
What about the Batcave?

609
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,480
I barely had enough time to initiate
the lockdown but...

610
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,040
Yeah, the Batcave is sealed.

611
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,400
We're not getting back in there.

612
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,880
But we got the Batsuit,
the Batmobile and not much else.

613
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,000
I am so sorry, Luke.

614
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,600
I traded away the Wayne legacy
for nothing.

615
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,920
You did it for Mary.

616
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,520
That's not nothing.

617
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,640
Good morning, citizens of Gotham.

618
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,160
I am honored and proud
to introduce myself

619
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
as the new leader in business.

620
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,360
{\an5}<i>You see, as times are changing,
it is time that we see</i>

621
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,400
{\an5}<i>the big money makers follow suit.</i>

622
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,960
Now, I know this town sees me
as a bit of a serial entrepreneur

623
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,360
but as the new CEO
of Wayne Enterprises...

624
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,520
<i>I promise you a front row seat</i>

625
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,680
<i>to the bleeding edge of the industry.</i>

626
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,720
<i>Where you'll not only see
inspiring innovation</i>

627
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,400
<i>from visionary thought leaders</i>

628
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,000
but you'll see that we're gonna
have a whole lot more fun.

629
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,120
While I was hired to fill the coffers
of my shareholders...

630
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,320
my main mission is to put a smile
on everyone's face.

631
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,600
<i>As many of you know I worked from...</i>

632
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,000
I am so hungover.

633
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,320
Then again, I was practically
turned into the human version

634
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,480
of a Long Island iced tea last night.

635
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,600
I need hash browns
and a coffee, stat.

636
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,040
What could possibly be
taking you so long?

637
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,320
You know, as much
as I make it look effortless

638
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,000
it takes time to make bad
look this good.

639
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,560
My, how you have blossomed.

640
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,520
I think your diabolical debut

641
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,240
deserves more
than a roadside greasy spoon

642
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,160
I don't care what we do
or where we go.

643
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,320
As long as it's fun.

644
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,720
<i>And now I call you to join me
at the peak of greatness.</i>

645
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,400
Well, he certainly looks like fun.
