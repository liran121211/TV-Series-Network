1
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:14,405
WOMAN ON OH, NO!

2
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:15,624
STOP!

3
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,060
THIS IS TERRIFYING.

4
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:19,149
THEY RELEASED THIS
TO THE PUBLIC?

5
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:20,542
KEEP YOUR NASTY FEET
ON YOUR SIDE

6
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,370
OF THE COUCH.

7
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,459
FINE. JEEZ.

8
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:25,851
CALL YOURSELF A ROOMMATE.

9
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,244
NO, I DON'T.

10
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,333
I'M A MILITARY-TRAINED
BABYSITTER

11
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,553
WHO MAKES SURE YOU'RE
RECEIVING YOUR PROPER MEDS.

12
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,472
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,171
SOMEONE'S ON THE BALCONY.

14
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:50,963
YOU DRANK MY PINOT?
I WAS SAVING THAT.

15
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:53,792
I'M SORRY. IT DIDN'T
HAVE YOUR NAME ON IT.

16
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:56,056
IT'S MY DAMN HOUSE.
ASSUME EVERYTHING

17
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:57,840
- HAS MY NAME ON IT.
- SHH!

18
00:00:57,883 --> 00:00:59,363
DO YOU WANT THE
PSYCHOTIC SLASHER

19
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:00,669
OUT THERE TO HEAR US?

20
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:02,236
GO.

21
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:06,153
ON 3.

22
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:09,025
1... 2, 3.

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,722
- UGH.
- AHH.

24
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:16,076
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.

25
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,599
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:20,080
I'M HERE FOR HER. GET DRESSED.

27
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:24,606
OH. ACTUALLY, I'M
SUPERCOMFY HERE

28
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:26,303
IN SOPHIE'S EX-HUSBAND'S

29
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:28,610
REALLY COOL SPORTS TEE.

30
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:30,264
RENEE INTERCEPTED SOME 911 CALL

31
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,570
WITH A LEAD
ON A POSSIBLE ROGUE WEAPON.

32
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,964
GET YOUR ASS DRESSED.

33
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:42,319
WELL, THIS CERTAINLY MAKES
SNUGGLING WITH SOPHIE SEEM TAME.

34
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:43,799
CAN YOU HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT

35
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,583
AND HELP ME GET HIM DOWN?

36
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:48,717
WHY ARE WE RUSHING? I'M
PRETTY SURE HE'S DEAD ALREADY.

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,154
YEAH. WELL, IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

38
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:54,897
BEFORE GCPD SHOWS UP
AND TAKES OUR EVIDENCE.

39
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,726
OH. PLEASE TELL ME WE DON'T
HAVE TO RECOVER HIS UNDIES.

40
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,989
JUST THE BINDINGS.

41
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:04,124
RENEE THINKS THE CULPRIT
USED CATWOMAN'S BULLWHIP.

42
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:07,039
AS IN ONE OF THE BAT TROPHIES?

43
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:10,173
WELL, THIS WAS EASY. FOUND IT.

44
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,349
CAN I PLEASE GO BACK
TO MY MOVIE NIGHT NOW?

45
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:15,265
I DON'T THINK THIS
IS CATWOMAN'S WHIP.

46
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:18,877
I DON'T CARE IF IT
BELONGED TO INDIANA JONES.

47
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,315
IF RENEE THINKS IT IS, LET HER,

48
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,186
SO SHE CAN CROSS
ANOTHER WEAPON OFF HER LIST

49
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,450
AND I CAN BE ONE STEP
CLOSER TO EARNING MY FREEDOM.

50
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:32,630
ACCORDING TO LUKE,

51
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:35,024
CATWOMAN AND BATMAN HAD A THING.

52
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:38,419
A THING? SO MUCH LEATHER.
HOW DID THAT WORK?

53
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:40,377
WELL FOR HER.
SHE APPARENTLY STOLE

54
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:42,399
SOME OF BATMAN'S NANOTECH
AND WOVE IT INTO HER WHIP,

55
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:43,989
MAKING IT INDESTRUCTIBLE.

56
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:46,383
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT WAS
CUT WITH A POCKET KNIFE.

57
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,472
I'LL HAVE SOMEONE FROM MARY'S
CLINIC PICK UP THE BODY

58
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,344
SO SHE CAN DO A THOROUGH EXAM.

59
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:52,824
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHO KILLED THIS GUY.

60
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:55,000
AND YOU... PARTNER?

61
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:56,872
I HAVE DINNER PLANS.

62
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:59,614
RENEE LITERALLY HAS THESE
MISSIONS HANGING OVER OUR HEADS.

63
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,964
WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE
MORE IMPORTANT?

64
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,445
SOMEONE WHO HAS MUCH
MORE HANGING OVER MINE.

65
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:07,839
MY MOTHER.

66
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:23,594
NO, MRS. BAXTER. I DID
NOT USE YOUR INVESTMENTS

67
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,640
TO FUND A LUXURY MUSIC FESTIVAL.

68
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:27,207
WAYNE STOCK IS DOWN 53%,

69
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,034
AND OUR CRISIS MANAGEMENT
TEAM JUST QUIT.

70
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:33,648
AS CEO, I URGE YOU
PLEASE IGNORE THE TABLOIDS.

71
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,432
I TOLD YOU I WILL FIX THIS.

72
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:37,042
YEAH. OK. WHEN?

73
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:38,629
THE COMPANY'S IN THE RED
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,

74
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,108
AND YOU'VE BEEN ON NONSTOP
DAMAGE CONTROL

75
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:41,482
FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS.

76
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:43,266
WHAT IS THIS?

77
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,573
UH, ROOMIE, WHEN YOU
TOOK OUT THE TRASH THIS MORNING,

78
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:49,794
YOU CLEARLY FORGOT TO DUMP OUT
JADA'S DINNER PARTY INVITATION.

79
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:52,275
IT CAME BY COURIER YESTERDAY.

80
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,408
UGH. OF COURSE SHE TURNS
AN EASY E-MAIL

81
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,323
INTO A MASSIVE CARBON FOOTPRINT.

82
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,206
SHE JUST TANKED WAYNE.
WHY WOULD SHE EVER THINK

83
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,196
THAT YOU'D WANT TO GO?

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,199
GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT, WON'T WE?

85
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,940
YOU'RE GOING.

86
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:07,899
ALICE FOUND EVIDENCE LINKING
JETURIAN TO BLACK GLOVE.

87
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:13,122
ALICE, WHO IS LITERALLY
HALLUCINATING SO BADLY

88
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:15,516
THAT WE HAD TO PULL HER
OUT OF AN INSANE ASYLUM.

89
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,474
OK. LOOK. WE NEED
TO FIND SOMETHING

90
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:19,955
TO HANG OVER JADA'S HEAD
LIKE SHE HAS OVER MINE.

91
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:22,827
UNTIL THEN, SHE WILL
ALWAYS HAVE US AT HER MERCY.

92
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:25,656
WE NEED A SMOKING GUN,
SO WE BUG HER OFFICE

93
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,267
AND SEE WHAT WE FIND OUT.

94
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,635
SHE'S NOT INVITING
YOU OVER TOP SHOW YOU

95
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,182
HER SILK LINENS, RYAN.

96
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:31,532
SHE HAS AN AGENDA,

97
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,098
AND IF SHE WAS ABLE TO UNCOVER

98
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:35,144
WAYNE'S HIDDEN ACCOUNTS...

99
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,726
SORRY. WHAT WAS I SAYING?

100
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,250
"IF SHE WAS ABLE TO UNCOVER
WAYNE'S HIDDEN ACCOUNTS"...

101
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,905
EXACTLY. THEN WHO'S
TO SAY SHE CAN'T

102
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,689
UNCOVER YOUR
HIDDEN IDENTITY, TOO?

103
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:02,171
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I NEED TO BE CAREFUL,

104
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:04,391
WHICH IS WHY I'M
BRINGING BACKUP.

105
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,131
SO YOU'RE RYAN'S DATE?

106
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,134
SO SAW THAT COMING.

107
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:11,833
IT'S NOT A DATE. IT'S RECON.

108
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,443
BUT YOU'RE WEARING
A PUSH-UP BRA,

109
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,358
SO IT'S A DATE.

110
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:17,099
YOU KNOW THIS IS
YOUR FAULT, RIGHT?

111
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:19,493
UGH. DON'T BLAME ME FOR
THIS REPULSIVE LOVE AFFAIR.

112
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,364
IF YOU'D NEVER TOLD RYAN THAT

113
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,235
HER BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
WAS STILL ALIVE,

114
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,889
WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS.

115
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:27,544
SOPH, THE GUILT I THINK
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE FEELING

116
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:31,026
IS SERIOUSLY KILLING
MY HALLUCINATION-FREE VIBES.

117
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:34,290
SERIOUSLY, FOR
THE LAST... 3 DAYS,

118
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,859
IT'S JUST BEEN ME,
MYSELF, AND I.

119
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,295
THE MEDS ARE WORKING.

120
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,558
CRAZY ALICE IS CRAZY NO MORE.

121
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:42,864
DON'T POKE THE BEAR.

122
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:47,434
TELL ME THAT YOU HEAR THAT.

123
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:51,351
IT'S YOUR PHONE. IT'S MONTOYA.

124
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:54,658
UGH. SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE.
I AM ON VACATION.

125
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:57,487
OH, NO. YOU'RE A CRIMINAL
WHO'S ON WORK RELEASE,

126
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:01,709
AND SHE SAID TO GET
YOUR ASS TO HER OFFICE NOW.

127
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,936
MAY I OFFER YOU A
BEVERAGE WHILE YOU WAIT?

128
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,852
THE MADAM RECOMMENDS
A 1994 COTE DES BLANCS.

129
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:17,507
- WE'RE GOOD.
- VERY WELL.

130
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:20,858
MADAM JET WILL BE DOWN SHORTLY.

131
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,817
"MADAM JET WILL BE
DOWN SHORTLY."

132
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,819
IS SHE FOR REAL?

133
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:27,648
AS REAL AS THE BLING
IN HER CHANDELIER.

134
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,432
I FEEL LIKE THE FOSTER KID

135
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,303
WHO ISN'T ALLOWED TO
SIT ON ANYTHING.

136
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:32,740
THAT'S THE POINT.

137
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,045
THIS IS AN INTIMIDATION MOVE

138
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,612
TO GET IN YOUR HEAD,
MAKE YOU THINK

139
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:37,353
YOU HAVE NOTHING AND
SHE'S GOT EVERYTHING.

140
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,809
THAT SHOULDN'T BE
TOO HARD CONSIDERING

141
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,183
MY LAST ADDRESS
WAS MY LICENSE PLATE.

142
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,624
RYAN, I'M GLAD YOU COULD COME.

143
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:49,583
AHH. I SEE YOU BROUGHT A FRIEND.

144
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:54,022
GIRLFRIEND ACTUALLY.

145
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:57,199
- SOPHIE. NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YOU, AS WELL.

146
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,375
SORRY TO INTERRUPT, MADAM.

147
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,769
THE CHEF ASSURES ME HE
HAS THINGS COVERED HERE.

148
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,553
GREAT. GOOD NIGHT, DAMIEN.

149
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,468
ON YOUR WAY OUT, WOULD
YOU PLEASE INFORM HIM

150
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:06,991
THAT WE'LL BE HAVING ANOTHER?

151
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,297
YES, MADAM.

152
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,483
- CHEF.
- HMM?

153
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,137
THE MADAM HAS
REQUESTED PREPARATIONS

154
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,617
FOR ANOTHER GUEST.

155
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,532
OH. THE MORE THE MERRIER.

156
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,283
THERE, THERE, LITTLE PIG.

157
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,985
UNH!

158
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:48,468
TIME FOR THE PROFESSOR
TO TEACH THE CLASS

159
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,295
HOW TO SQUEAL.

160
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,951
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

161
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,218
SO HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?

162
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,525
RYAN AND THROUGH FRIENDS.

163
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,353
WAS IT A TUESDAY?

164
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:07,661
DEFINITELY BECAUSE IT WAS, UH...

165
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,706
TACO NIGHT.

166
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,841
AND... YOU OFFERED
TO BUY ME A DRINK

167
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,843
TO WASH DOWN THE CHIPS.

168
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,758
THE CHIPS. HEH.

169
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,455
UH, YOU KNOW...
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE CORNER

170
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,085
OF THE CHIP GETS STUCK
IN THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT.

171
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:23,546
YEAH. JUST THE COUGHING,
CHOKING, WATERY EYES.

172
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,635
I MEAN, I THINK THERE
WAS SWEAT INVOLVED.

173
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,116
- SOUNDS ROMANTIC.
- IT WASN'T CUTE,

174
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,596
BUT THAT'S THE POINT.

175
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,990
I MEAN... SOMEONE SEES YOU
AT YOUR NOT CUTEST

176
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,905
AND STILL ASKS YOU OUT?

177
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,298
I MEAN, AT THE END OF THE DAY,

178
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,561
WE JUST WANT SOMEONE
WHO'S LOYAL.

179
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,998
I KNOW THAT IF I WERE DYING

180
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,739
SOPHIE WOULD SIT BESIDE ME,

181
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,175
PUT HER ARMS AROUND ME,
AND TELL ME

182
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,916
EVERYTHING WOULD BE OK.

183
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:52,009
EXCUSE ME. BATHROOM?

184
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,663
LAST ROOM DOWN THE HALL.

185
00:08:58,146 --> 00:09:00,104
WE SHOULD ALL BE SO LUCKY.

186
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:01,758
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

187
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,368
HMM. YEAH.

188
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:11,333
NOW LET'S GET UGLY.
WHY AM I HERE?

189
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:13,465
IF THIS IS YOUR OLIVE BRANCH

190
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:15,337
FOR DESTROYING MY COMPANY,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED

191
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,600
A DAMN ORCHARD.

192
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:19,471
I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR

193
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:21,430
WHEN I TOLD YOU TO STAY
AWAY FROM MY FAMILY.

194
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,780
AND NOW I'M IN YOUR LIVING ROOM,

195
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:25,608
SO WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

196
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,306
WHATEVER'S GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND MARQUIS

197
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,873
NEEDS TO STOP.

198
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,179
WHO SAYS SOMETHING'S GOING ON?

199
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:33,834
A MOTHER ALWAYS KNOWS.

200
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,749
NOW I NEED YOU TO
ASK YOUR GIRL TO LEAVE

201
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,838
SO I CAN GET REAL WITH YOU.

202
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:40,928
GET REAL? RICH COMING
FROM THE WOMAN

203
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,494
WHO CONVINCED ME SHE WAS DEAD.

204
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:45,846
HMM. DYING WILL BE
THE EASY PART, RYAN,

205
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,848
FOR YOU AND A LOT OF FOLKS

206
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:50,546
IF YOU DON'T DO
EXACTLY WHAT I SAY.

207
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,854
YO! NOBODY AT THE DOOR?

208
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,812
WHERE'S MY MAN DAMIEN?

209
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,553
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT KIND OF PSYCHO

210
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,773
MIGHT COME WALTZING
INTO THIS PLACE.

211
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:03,254
MARQUIS, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

212
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,822
HEARD THERE WAS A FAMILY DINNER.

213
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:12,829
SOPHIE, BATCAVE.

214
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:14,091
COPY. ARE YOU IN?

215
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:18,269
10 BEDROOMS
AND 15 BATHROOMS LATER,

216
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:19,967
I FOUND HER STUDY.

217
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,316
OK. GOOD. FIND SOMEWHERE CENTRAL

218
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,100
AWAY FROM A.C. VENTS, SHREDDERS,

219
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,973
ANYTHING THAT CREATES NOISE.

220
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,931
ALL RIGHT. I'M AT HER DESK.
FIRE IT UP.

221
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,981
TESTING 1, 2, 3.

222
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:37,245
ALL RIGHT. WE ARE UP.
NOW GET OUT OF THERE.

223
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:39,813
I WILL IN TWO SECONDS.

224
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:43,120
SOPHIE, I STRONGLY SUGGEST
THAT YOU GET OUT OF THERE.

225
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:58,614
LOOKS LIKE RYAN WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE

226
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,748
CUT OUT OF THE FAMILY.

227
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,315
I'M GONNA SEND YOU A FACE
TO RUN THROUGH REC.

228
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,491
AH. GO FOR IT. STANDING BY.

229
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:10,974
SOPHIE?

230
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:12,584
LUKE, DO YOU COPY?

231
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,282
HEY. HEY, SOPHIE.

232
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:19,374
LUKE, DO YOU COPY?

233
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:26,816
THE POWDER ROOM'S ON
THE FIRST FLOOR, HONEY.

234
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,690
BIG HOUSE. GOT LOST.

235
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,387
DINNER'S READY.

236
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:44,094
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
A SECRET PARTNERSHIP,

237
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,593
AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE
HAVING SECRET DINNERS WITH HER?

238
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:46,793
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

239
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,708
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU.

240
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,361
SHE ALREADY KNOWS
ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP.

241
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:51,711
HOW?

242
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:59,588
CAN WE PLEASE EAT
BEFORE ANY MORE GUESTS ARRIVE?

243
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,168
SO SHE DOESN'T THINK
IT'S A TROPHY.

244
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:17,780
OH, SOMETHING ABOUT BATMAN AND
CATWOMAN BETWEEN THE SHEETS.

245
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:20,740
PERSONALLY, I DIDN'T THINK
HEROES DID THAT SORT OF THING,

246
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,090
BUT, UH, WHAT DO I KNOW?

247
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,483
I'M A VILLAIN.

248
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,748
THEN PROVE ME WRONG.

249
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,271
OHH. THIS IS A RECORD
OF EVERY ROGUE

250
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:32,099
THAT'S TORMENTED GOTHAM.

251
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:33,840
IF IT'S NOT A CATWOMAN WANNABE,

252
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,320
THEN USE THAT
BEAUTIFULLY DEMENTED MIND

253
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:38,409
AND TELL ME WHO WOULD STRING UP

254
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:41,238
A NAKED MAN IN AN AUTO
SHOP WITH A BULLWHIP.

255
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:56,253
MAGPIE... NOT POSSIBLE. TOO MANY
SHINY PIERCINGS LEFT ON THE VICTIM.

256
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:59,343
SHELLY GAYNOR... AKA THE WHIP.

257
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:00,910
SOUNDS PROMISING.

258
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:03,739
MMM... NO. ANIMAL ADVOCATE.

259
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,655
HER WHIP WAS FAUX LEATHER.

260
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:08,178
HMM.

261
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:11,225
WELL, THIS ONE IS
KINKIER THAN A GARDEN HOSE,

262
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:15,142
BUT, UM, TALIA AL GHUL
IS FAR TOO IMPATIENT

263
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,144
FOR PERFORMATIVE VICTIM STAGING.

264
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:26,066
I THINK WE FOUND OUR GIRL...

265
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:29,809
MANIPULATIVE, OBSESSIVE,
BACKSTABBING.

266
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,288
WHO IS SHE?

267
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,249
YOU.

268
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:40,036
WHAT'S WITH YOUR CREEPY
OBSESSION WITH POISON IVY?

269
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,169
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

270
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:46,869
MMM. HEH. YOUR CASE FILES
ON EVERYONE ELSE ARE... ANEMIC,

271
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,828
BUT THIS ONE ON PAM ISLEY READS

272
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,787
LIKE YOU'RE, UH, PLANNING
ON WRITING A BIOPIC...

273
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,225
JUICY INTERVIEWS,
DETAILED FACT SHEETS.

274
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:59,751
OHH! A CONFIDENTIAL
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION.

275
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,101
TSK, TSK, TSK, TSK.

276
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:04,495
NOW YOU NEED TO PROVE ME WRONG.

277
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:08,499
ARE BATWOMAN AND I LOOKING FOR
THESE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

278
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:10,240
TO STOP CRIMINALS?

279
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,678
BECAUSE I THINK THAT
YOU BROUGHT US TOGETHER

280
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:17,378
TO FIND ONE VINY VIXEN
IN PARTICULAR.

281
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:33,568
ANYBODY ELSE FEEL A LITTLE
SORRY FOR THAT THING?

282
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:37,485
ROASTED SUCKLING IS CONSIDERED
A DELICACY IN MOST OF THE WORLD.

283
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,791
I'M VEGAN, SO IT DOESN'T MATTER

284
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,576
WHAT CONTINENT MY ASS IS ON.

285
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,447
I'M NOT TOUCHING THAT.

286
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:46,146
PERHAPS MORE WINE
WILL ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE.

287
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:48,496
OUR ESTEEMED CHEF FLEW
FROM METROPOLIS

288
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:49,889
TO COOK FOR US.

289
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,281
HE COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

290
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,676
SO IF I MAY,

291
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,156
YOU'RE THE ESTRANGED DAUGHTER

292
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,984
WHO JUST RECENTLY BONDED
WITH YOUR BROTHER,

293
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,049
BUT THAT'S BAD BECAUSE HE HAS
A CODEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP

294
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:02,510
WITH HIS MOTHER, WHO
NOW SEES YOU AS A THREAT

295
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:04,686
TO HER RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER SON.

296
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:07,732
ZOEY'S DISSERTATION IS ON
MODERN FAMILY DYNAMICS.

297
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,909
PARTICULARLY TRIANGULATION
AS IT RELATES

298
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,606
TO BOWEN'S FAMILY
THEORY PARADIGM...

299
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,043
RESCUER, VICTIM, PERSECUTOR.

300
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,872
THAT'S INTERESTING.
DOES BOWEN HAVE A TERM

301
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,179
FOR BACKSTABBING SISTERS?

302
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:24,401
UH, I NEED THE LADIES'.
TANNINS GO RIGHT THROUGH ME.

303
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:26,795
- BACKSTABBING SISTERS?
- MM-HMM.

304
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,232
I WASN'T THE ONE WHO
ORCHESTRATED THIS WHOLE DINNER.

305
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,278
JADA DID.

306
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,019
WAS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?

307
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,673
MARQUIS FINDS OUT I'M
HAVING DINNER WITH HIS MOM,

308
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,501
SO HE STOPS TRUSTING ME.

309
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:39,479
IF WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT TRUST,

310
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,375
LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND THOUGHT

311
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:43,377
SHE WAS GOING TO FIND
IN MY STUDY.

312
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:48,556
EXACTLY. SO DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT HAVING AN AGENDA.

313
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,258
YOU'RE RIGHT, JADA. I DID
COME HERE WITH AN AGENDA.

314
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:58,218
I CAME TO SAY THANK YOU.

315
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,524
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME UP.

316
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:02,309
THANK YOU FOR WALKING AWAY

317
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:03,939
AND LETTING ME BE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM

318
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,530
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET THE BUTLERS

319
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:10,273
OR THE 5-COURSE MEAL
OR THE MANSION.

320
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:14,190
I GOT A HOME. I GOT LOVE.

321
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,149
I GOT A REAL MOTHER.

322
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,857
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, ZOEY.

323
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,251
WINE AND FAMILY DRAMA
DO NOT MIX.

324
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,868
WHY CAN'T I FEEL ANYTHING?

325
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,793
TURN THE FAUCET, ZOEY.

326
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,107
AAH!

327
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:08,003
GOT TO SAY I'M NOT ABOUT TO LET

328
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,465
MY BABY SISTER WIN
BEST SPEECH OF THE NIGHT.

329
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:13,617
MARQUIS, HAVEN'T WE HAD ENOUGH
THEATRICS FOR ONE EVENING?

330
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,077
DON'T WORRY.

331
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,645
I'LL KEEP IT SIMPLE.

332
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:21,127
TO FAMILY AND LOYALTY.

333
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:31,615
- YOU OK?
- WHAT?

334
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,139
I CAN'T MOVE MY ARMS.

335
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,491
RELAX.

336
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,455
JUST A LITTLE PARALYTIC.

337
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:46,978
YOU MON...

338
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:49,024
OK. MAYBE A LOT OF PARALYTIC.

339
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:52,245
GET AWAY FROM US.

340
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:55,117
YOU'RE NOT AN EASY
WOMAN TO GET ALONE.

341
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,684
PRACTICALLY HAD TO CONVINCE YOU

342
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:59,774
I WAS ROYALTY TO GET
THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.

343
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:06,476
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME, MRS. JET?

344
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,043
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE.

345
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,740
DO YOU REALLY FIRE
SO MANY PEOPLE

346
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:11,481
THEY'RE ALL A BLUR?

347
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:14,223
LAZLO VALENTIN. I WAS A CHEF

348
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:16,225
IN THE DINING HALL
AT YOUR OFFICE

349
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:18,271
UNTIL YOU FIRED ME.

350
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,752
VALENTIN. OK.
I REMEMBER THE NAME.

351
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:24,103
GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT I REMEMBER?

352
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,105
TELLING MY FAMILY,

353
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,933
"HEY, GUYS. NO MORE MONEY'S
COMING IN FOR A WHILE.

354
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,674
"BOSS LADY HATES
DADDY'S COOKING,

355
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:33,329
SO NOW NOBODY WANTS
TO HIRE HIM ANYMORE."

356
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:35,331
YEAH, AND I REMEMBER
THE DIVORCE PAPERS,

357
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,551
THE DEBT COLLECTORS,
THE REPO MAN.

358
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:39,292
DO YOU REALLY THINK
SHE REMEMBERS

359
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,120
THE DAMN COOK
FROM THE BUILDING CAF?

360
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,730
- MARQUIS.
- NAW. YOU PROBABLY SAID

361
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:46,125
THE FOOD SUCKED, YOUR
STAFF REPLACED HIS ASS.

362
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,083
IT'S JUST BUSINESS, BRO.

363
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,606
JUST BUSINESS?!

364
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,956
I LOST MY FAMILY BECAUSE OF HER,

365
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,046
SO NOW YOU'LL LOSE YOURS.

366
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,179
YOU TOLD MARQUIS
ABOUT THIS DINNER.

367
00:18:57,223 --> 00:19:01,270
HOW ELSE COULD YOU WATCH ME
CHOP HIM INTO BACON BITS?

368
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:05,883
BUT THE UNEXPECTED
DAUGHTER... HA HA HA!

369
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,929
TALK ABOUT AN AMUSE-BOUCHE.

370
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:10,236
- HUH!
- AGH!

371
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,846
AAH! UGH!

372
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:17,373
MARQUIS, COME ON.

373
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:20,246
I CAN'T... I CAN'T MOVE.

374
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:22,770
ZOEY... SHE'S STILL UPSTAIRS.

375
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:25,076
I GOT HIM. GO.

376
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,253
I'LL FIND ZOEY.

377
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,646
GET OUTSIDE. CALL FOR HELP.

378
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,387
I GOT YOU. COME ON.

379
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,888
ZOEY. ZOEY, WE GOT TO GO.

380
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:02,984
AAH!

381
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:08,076
IT WON'T OPEN.
WHY WON'T IT OPEN?

382
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,209
HE MUST HAVE LOCKED US
IN FROM THE OUTSIDE.

383
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:17,912
MY PHONE HAS NO SERVICE.

384
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:19,870
MINE EITHER.

385
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:22,264
WHICH LITTLE PIGGY
WENT TO MARKET?

386
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:25,572
WHICH LITTLE PIGGY
SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME?

387
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,835
UPSTAIRS. FOLLOW ME.

388
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,796
GO. GO WITHOUT ME.

389
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,582
NO, MARQUIS. COME ON.
YOU CAN DO THIS. LET'S GO.

390
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,149
AHH! UNH!

391
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:46,723
AAH! UNH!

392
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,640
A LESSON FROM PROFESSOR PYG!

393
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:53,600
NOBODY LIKES AN UNINVITED GUEST!

394
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,428
HYAH! UNH!

395
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:56,777
UNH! OHH!

396
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,781
COME ON. COME ON!

397
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,332
ERRR!

398
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,942
HUH!

399
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,814
ERR! HA HA HA!

400
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:39,602
I'LL HUFF, AND I'LL PUFF

401
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:43,389
AND BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN!

402
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:48,045
HE'S GONE... FOR NOW.

403
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:52,876
ZOEY'S DEAD.

404
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,096
OH, MY GOD.

405
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:56,489
AND HE'S NOT LEAVING THIS HOUSE

406
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:58,969
UNTIL WE ARE, TOO.

407
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:04,366
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

408
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,325
IT'S A PANIC ROOM.
I CONVERTED ONE

409
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,762
OF MY CLOSETS A FEW YEARS BACK.

410
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:11,808
YOU MUST HAVE A LOT OF ENEMIES.

411
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:14,724
SECRET CLOSET SPACE AND ALL.

412
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,247
SIGNAL'S DEAD.

413
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,075
I HAD A CALL DROP EARLIER.

414
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,295
HE MUST HAVE ACTIVATED
SOME SORT OF...

415
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,385
SIGNAL BLOCKER.

416
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:25,996
TELL ME YOU HAVE A GUN IN HERE.

417
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,565
UH-UH. I DON'T BELIEVE IN GUNS.

418
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:32,612
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOT TORTUROUS ENOUGH?

419
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:34,091
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

420
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:37,138
EVERYBODY, JUST CHILL, OK?

421
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,966
SOMEONE WILL EVENTUALLY
REALIZE WE'RE MISSING

422
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,402
AND COME LOOKING FOR US.

423
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,622
WE JUST NEED TO HANG UNTIL THEN.

424
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:46,713
MARQUIS?

425
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:55,199
MARQUIS! MARQUIS! MARQUIS!
MARQUIS!

426
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:00,727
PAMELA AND I MET AT GOTHAM U.

427
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,250
I WAS STUDYING CRIMINAL LAW.

428
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:04,557
SHE WAS INTO BOTANY,
COMPLETE OPPOSITES,

429
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,517
BUT COULDN'T SEE A
FUTURE WITHOUT THE OTHER.

430
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:10,519
- LOVE THAT.
- AT THE SAME TIME,

431
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,260
ONE OF HER CLASSMATES
WAS CONDUCTING

432
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:15,306
THESE OBSESSIVE
EXPERIMENTS FOR HIS Ph.D.

433
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,266
HE AND PAM WERE COMPETITIVE,

434
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:20,442
BOTH SUPERSMART, KIND OF NERDY.

435
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,028
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
HARMLESS UNTIL ONE NIGHT

436
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:25,316
HE ABDUCTED PAM AND USED
HER AS HIS GUINEA PIG.

437
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,015
LET ME GUESS...
THAT'D BE MARC LeGRAND.

438
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:30,234
WHATEVER HE INJECTED
HER WITH WAS POISON,

439
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:33,063
SOME AWFUL COMBINATION
OF THINGS AROUND HIS LAB...

440
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:36,415
OLEANDER, NIGHTSHADE,
WATER HEMLOCK.

441
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,373
CHANGED HER ENTIRE PHYSIOLOGY.

442
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,506
TURNED HER INTO
A GREEN-THUMBED PSYCHO.

443
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:41,942
SHE DIDN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

444
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,509
SHE WANTED TO SAVE THE PLANET,

445
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:46,381
AND THAT MEANT PUNISHING
ANYONE DESTROYING IT.

446
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,122
EXCEPT AN UP-AND-COMING COP

447
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:50,472
SHACKING UP WITH A SERIAL KILLER

448
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:54,824
KIND OF PUTS A CRAMP
IN THE OLD CAREER TRAJECTORY.

449
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,696
SHE WENT FROM
COMPASSIONATE AND LOVING

450
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:58,872
TO RECKLESS AND IRRATIONAL
OVERNIGHT.

451
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,482
TOTAL PERSONALITY CHANGE.

452
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:02,397
IT EVENTUALLY JUST
TORE US APART.

453
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,530
SUBTEXT... YOU CHOSE
YOUR CAREER OVER YOUR GIRL.

454
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:07,402
SHE WAS LOST... OK?

455
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,362
GONE. EMOTIONALLY, MENTALLY
A SHELL OF THE PERSON I KNEW,

456
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,886
AND I... I WAS YOUNG.

457
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:14,322
I HAD NO IDEA HOW TO SAVE HER.

458
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,759
OH, RELAX. I'M NOT
ACTUALLY INVESTED

459
00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:18,369
IN YOUR LOVE STORY.

460
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:20,807
SO WHERE'S POISON PAM?

461
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,722
THAT'S A QUESTION FOR BATMAN.

462
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:26,465
WELL, SHE'S NOT
IN ARKHAM... I WOULD KNOW...

463
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,511
AND BORING BATMAN DIDN'T
ACTUALLY KILL ANYONE,

464
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:34,037
SO UNLESS SHE SLITHERED
UP JACK'S BEANSTALK...

465
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:36,475
MY THEORY IS HE HID HER
UNDER THE CITY SOMEWHERE

466
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,954
AWAY FROM WATER AND SUNLIGHT

467
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:39,739
AND ANYONE SHE COULD HURT.

468
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:42,568
WHY WOULD BATMAN BURY
YOUR GIRLFRIEND ALIVE?

469
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,006
BECAUSE I TOLD HIM TO.

470
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:54,623
THIS SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING.

471
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:58,671
WHAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN?

472
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,937
THIS LONG, SAPPY TANGENT,

473
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,984
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A
POTENTIAL SADIST ON THE LOOSE.

474
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:11,422
I'M GOING TO GO SEE
OUR MEDICAL EXPERT

475
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,816
AND SEE IF SHE FOUND
ANYTHING ON THE VIC'S BODY.

476
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:23,304
DRINK THE WATER, MARQUIS.

477
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:26,220
WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE SHE'S OK.

478
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,962
HE DRANK THE MOST,
SO IT'S HITTING HIM FIRST,

479
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:33,532
BUT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE IT'S ALL OF US.

480
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,969
OK, OK.

481
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:37,579
65 OVER 30.

482
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,146
THAT'S BAD.

483
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:40,800
IF IT KEEPS DROPPING,
HE'S GONNA DIE.

484
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:43,063
- HE NEEDS ADRENALINE.
- I KNOW.

485
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:44,847
THERE'S NONE IN HERE.

486
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:46,327
THERE ARE EPIPENS.

487
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,783
MY HUSBAND CARRIED THEM
FOR HIS ALLERGIES.

488
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:50,113
- WHERE?
- WITH OUR CAMPING GEAR.

489
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,593
IN THE BASEMENT.

490
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:58,600
TELL ME THERE'S ANOTHER WAY
TO GET INTO THE BASEMENT.

491
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:00,428
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?

492
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,821
BUILDING A BOMB.

493
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:07,391
I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

494
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,485
OHH.

495
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:15,878
COME ON.

496
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:28,456
LAZLO. LAZLO, WHERE ARE YOU?

497
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,589
LAZLO, I WANT A TRUCE.

498
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:32,286
YOU NEED MONEY? HOW MUCH?

499
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,722
I'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT.

500
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:35,158
LET'S TALK.

501
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:42,339
LAZLO, I'M SORRY.

502
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:43,993
I REALLY AM.

503
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,413
RAH! OHH!

504
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,067
UNH!

505
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:18,985
AGH!

506
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:47,013
IT WASN'T PRETTY,
BUT SHE MADE IT.

507
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:50,625
SO ARE YOU REALLY
RYAN'S GIRLFRIEND,

508
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,062
OR WAS THAT A LIE, TOO?

509
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,195
WANT TO KNOW WHO I REALLY AM?

510
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:01,680
I'M JORDAN MOORE'S SISTER.

511
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:03,203
I'M SORRY. I'M LIGHTHEADED.

512
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:06,162
AM I SUPPOSED TO
KNOW WHO THAT IS?

513
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:08,991
YOUR MEN ABDUCTED HER

514
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:12,778
AND INJECTED HER
WITH FREEZE SERUM,

515
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,910
KILLED 3 OF HER FRIENDS,

516
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:16,477
NEARLY KILLED HER.

517
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,305
WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

518
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,742
STOP!

519
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,309
DON'T TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW

520
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:24,833
ABOUT HUMAN EXPERIMENTS
BEING CONDUCTED

521
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:27,270
BY YOUR OWN EMPLOYEES.

522
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:32,798
SO IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE DOING IN MY STUDY,

523
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,974
LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE?

524
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,802
WHAT'D YOU FIND, SOPHIE,

525
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:39,630
"THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK"?

526
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:43,286
LOOK. I AM SORRY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOUR SISTER,

527
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,942
BUT I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

528
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,902
I'M NOT THE MONSTER
YOU'VE MADE ME OUT TO BE.

529
00:28:57,257 --> 00:29:01,130
STAY WITH ME, SON. MAMA'S HERE.

530
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,361
OHH.

531
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:16,058
OF COURSE.

532
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:19,932
PROFESSOR COME ON!

533
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,713
OK. OK.

534
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:05,107
COME ON, RYAN. MOVE YOUR ARM.

535
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:07,283
MOVE YOUR DAMN... ARM!

536
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:08,676
UNH!

537
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:11,853
COME ON, COME ON.

538
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:16,118
COME... ON.

539
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:35,311
VIC HAD MOTORCYCLE GREASE

540
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:36,747
UNDERNEATH HIS FINGERNAILS.

541
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,576
I FOUND A SIMILAR
BUT NOT EXACT VISCOUS SYNTHETIC

542
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,623
ON THE BULLWHIP.

543
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,973
FASCINATING.

544
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:47,410
WHAT'S WITH
THE BOTANICAL GARDEN?

545
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:50,239
OH, DID THE MEDICAL BOARD
TAKE AWAY YOUR LICENSE

546
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:54,591
AND LEAVE YOU TO THE
WHIMS OF HERBAL MEDICINE.

547
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:57,246
DO YOU KNOW HOW I SAVED
JORDAN MOORE'S LIFE?

548
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,074
- NO.
- I MIMICKED THE ANTIFREEZE

549
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:01,076
SYNTHESIS DONE BY PLANTS
TO SURVIVE

550
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,773
SUBZERO TEMPERATURES.

551
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:04,253
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

552
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,255
BECAUSE PLANTS ARE
SMARTER THAN HUMANS.

553
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,779
THEY'RE RESILIENT,
THEY'RE INTUITIVE,

554
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:10,738
THEY GIVE BACK MORE
THAN THEY TAKE.

555
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:15,308
GOT IT. JEEZ. SORRY I ASKED.

556
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:17,658
ANYWAY, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE BEING

557
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:20,574
ALL HERO COMPLEXY
AND TOLD ME BECAUSE

558
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:23,446
YOU'RE A OFFICIAL DOCTOR
NOW IT IS YOUR DUTY

559
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,709
TO HELP ME WHEN THE TIME COMES?

560
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:29,365
WELL... THAT TIME IS UPON US.

561
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:34,849
THE DELUSIONS ARE BACK.

562
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,724
BETWEEN THE... INMATES
IN ARKHAM,

563
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:44,119
THE EXPERIMENTAL MEDS, THE GENERAL
MISE EN SCEÈNE OF CAPTIVITY,

564
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:48,123
I ASSUMED IT WAS THE ASYLUM
THAT WAS MAKING ME CRAZY.

565
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,434
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I HAVE ENJOYED

566
00:31:54,477 --> 00:31:57,654
MY FAIR SHARE OF DISASSOCIATION.

567
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:59,656
YOU'RE TALKING TO THE
GIRL WHO CONVINCED HERSELF

568
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,268
THAT 12 YEARS
OF SEWING SKIN MASKS

569
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:03,965
WAS A FANCY TEA PARTY.

570
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,882
BUT I WAS IN CONTROL THEN.

571
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,406
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

572
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,106
I'M NOT IN CONTROL ANYMORE.

573
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:18,849
AS IF WHAT'S HAPPENING
ISN'T OBVIOUS?

574
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:21,200
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW, ALICE.

575
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:24,377
ALL OF THE MURDERS,
THE PAIN, THE MISERY

576
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,771
THAT YOU'VE INFLICTED, THEY
WERE THE SEEDS THAT YOU PLANTED

577
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:29,904
FOR THE GARDEN
YOU'LL BE BURIED IN.

578
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:36,780
GOT IT.

579
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:49,837
SPEAKING OF GARDENS,

580
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,926
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN FROLICKING?

581
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,536
GOTHAM PARK.

582
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,149
I THINK I EXPOSED MYSELF
TO WHATEVER THAT THING IS.

583
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,629
OHH. I TOOK A SAMPLE
OF THE VINE,

584
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:03,068
BUT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
IF IT'S POISON OAK,

585
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:05,287
POISON SUMAC, POISON HEMLOCK.

586
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:06,506
POISON IVY.

587
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,813
LET ME IN!

588
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,685
OH, MY GOD.

589
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,034
HE'S GOT RYAN.

590
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:16,168
OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW!

591
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:19,301
BUT HE WANTS YOU.

592
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:24,002
IF I OPEN THIS DOOR,
I'M AS GOOD AS DEAD.

593
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,742
UGH.

594
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,234
YOUR LESSON IS

595
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,063
THAT WHEN SOMEONE SHOWS YOU
WHO THEY ARE BELIEVE THEM

596
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,891
BECAUSE IF I'M HOW SHE
TREATS THE PEOPLE

597
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:45,849
SPENDING THEIR DAYS
TRYING TO IMPRESS HER,

598
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:49,070
GUESS HOW SHE'LL TREAT
SOMEONE SHE SEES AS A THREAT.

599
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:50,941
GET AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER!

600
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:01,474
TAKE ME INSTEAD.
SHE DID NOTHING TO YOU.

601
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:04,216
WELL, WELL, MADAM SWINE.

602
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:07,262
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR LESSON IS?

603
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:10,396
PERFECTION COMES AT A PRICE.

604
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,413
ERR!

605
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:31,765
RRR!

606
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,506
RAAH!

607
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:38,772
- RAH!
- LOOK OUT!

608
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,386
INCOMING!

609
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,127
AAGH!

610
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,049
UNH!

611
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,880
AHH! AHH! AHH!

612
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:01,490
AAH!

613
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,504
AHH. FLAMINGO.

614
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:16,897
EXCUSE ME?

615
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,768
THE BULLWHIP KILLER.

616
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:25,514
IT'S THE FLAMBOYANT, PINK
HARLEY-STRADDLING PSYCHO FLAMINGO.

617
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,299
VICTIM WAS IN A RIVAL GANG,

618
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:33,392
DNA EVIDENCE,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH... SCIENCE,

619
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:37,526
BUT THE POINT IS
IF THE BIKER BOOT FITS...

620
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:42,662
I'LL ALERT THE VICTIM'S
FAMILY AND PUT OUT

621
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:45,055
A WARRANT FOR THIS FLAMINGO,

622
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:48,624
AND I GUESS THAT MEANS CATWOMAN'S
WHIP IS STILL OUT THERE.

623
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:52,541
OHH, AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET TO THAT

624
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:54,326
WHEN I'M BACK FROM TAHITI

625
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:58,373
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT, UM...

626
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:01,463
THIS BUYS ME A WEEK'S VACATION.

627
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:04,031
AND WHAT IS THIS?

628
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,164
YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

629
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:10,385
ALTHOUGH SHE IS LOOKING
A LITTLE FRAIL.

630
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,822
THIS IS A DEAD CUTTING
FROM HER VINE.

631
00:36:12,866 --> 00:36:15,129
- WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
- DOES IT MATTER?

632
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,653
I REUNITED YOU
WITH YOUR LONG, LOST LOVE.

633
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:20,656
TO THINK I WAS CONFUSED
ABOUT BATMAN AND CATWOMAN.

634
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:26,184
IT MATTERS BECAUSE THESE
VINES DON'T DIE UNLESS...

635
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:28,708
UNLESS WHAT?

636
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,884
UNLESS SHE'S
INFECTED SOMEONE ELSE.

637
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:46,769
WHAT YOU THINKING ABOUT?

638
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:49,250
- WHAT WAS FOR DESSERT.
- HEH.

639
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,167
JADA'S HIDING SOMETHING.

640
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,389
I DON'T KNOW WHAT,
BUT I TRUST MY GUT ON THIS.

641
00:36:57,432 --> 00:36:58,955
SHE'S LYING.

642
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:04,613
THEN IT'S TIME FOR HER
TO TELL ME EVERYTHING.

643
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:10,358
CALL YOU TOMORROW,
TELL YOU WHAT I LEARNED?

644
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:15,798
GOOD LUCK.

645
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:19,976
GREAT FIRST DATE, HUH?

646
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:23,980
DEFINITELY MEMORABLE.

647
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,828
AND PEOPLE WONDER WHY I
DON'T THROW DINNER PARTIES.

648
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:47,395
YOU OK?

649
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:53,271
YOUR GIRLFRIEND LEFT THIS.

650
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,490
ONCE A CROW ALWAYS A CROW, HUH?

651
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:01,366
I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT JORDAN MOORE.

652
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:03,846
YOUR WORD IS NOT GOOD
ENOUGH, JADA.

653
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,587
WELL, IT HAS TO BE.

654
00:38:05,631 --> 00:38:08,416
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT JORDAN

655
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,506
OR THE EXPERIMENTS
OR THE DEATHS.

656
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,380
HOW COULD I? I'M A MOTHER.

657
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:18,165
THE WHOLE POINT OF ALL THIS
WAS THAT NO ONE ELSE GET HURT.

658
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,254
THE WHOLE POINT OF WHAT?

659
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:25,215
I'M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING,

660
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:28,175
AND FOR YOUR SAKE, FOR
EVERYONE YOU LOVE'S SAKE,

661
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:29,655
YOU NEED TO KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

662
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:31,874
- YOU NEED TO PROMISE ME THAT.
- I CAN'T,

663
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,050
NOT UNTIL I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

664
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:38,272
MARQUIS IS SICK.

665
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:51,459
WHAT'S GOING ON, MARQUIS?

666
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:53,026
WHAT'D YOU GET
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

667
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:54,723
A BUG COLLECTOR KIT.

668
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,421
HA! THAT'S COOL.

669
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:58,640
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT MAGNIFYING GLASS?

670
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:02,470
MELTING ANTS. SEE?

671
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:05,473
THEY BURN UP IN THE SUN.

672
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,606
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT

673
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:09,303
DURING A SCHOOL FIELD TRIP.

674
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,784
MARQUIS WAS ON THE BUS.

675
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:13,960
IT PULLED UP TO A STOPLIGHT.

676
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:21,924
AND SUDDENLY, A MAN
DRESSED LIKE A CLOWN...

677
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:26,581
GREEN HAIR, PURPLE
SUIT, BIG, UGLY SMILE...

678
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,453
HE JUMPED ON BOARD,
TOOK OVER THE BUS.

679
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:29,976
THE JOKER?

680
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:34,459
THERE WAS AN ENCOUNTER
WITH MY SON.

681
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:37,549
THE JOKER HAD THIS
ZAPPER ON HIS HAND.

682
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:39,725
- THE JOY BUZZER.
- WHATEVER IT'S CALLED.

683
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:41,683
HE PRESSED IT AGAINST
MY SON'S FOREHEAD,

684
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:44,512
AND AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE
WENT THROUGH HIS BRAIN.

685
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:47,559
AFTER THAT DAY,
HE WAS DIFFERENT, DARK,

686
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:49,517
HORRIFYING.

687
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:54,348
MARQUIS? NO. MARQUIS HAS
BEEN NOTHING BUT NICE TO ME.

688
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,657
SOCIOPATHS ARE CHARMING
95% OF THE TIME, RYAN.

689
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,659
MOM, DON'T BE SO LAME.

690
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:02,487
IT'S NOT LAME TO TELL
YOUR DAD HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

691
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,097
I WROTE HIM A CARD!

692
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,664
SWEETHEART, YOUR
FATHER'S OVERSEAS,

693
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:07,448
AND IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH TO HIM

694
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:10,582
- IF HE HEARD IT FROM YOUR...
- I SAID NO!

695
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,019
SPECIALISTS, NEUROLOGISTS,
PSYCHOLOGISTS.

696
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:17,023
I HAVE SPENT MILLIONS TRYING
TO FIX HIM BEHIND HIS BACK

697
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:19,721
SO I COULD HAVE
MY SWEET BOY AGAIN,

698
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:22,420
BUT NO ONE'S BEEN ABLE
TO HELP ME,

699
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:25,118
AND THEN I LEARNED
OF CRYOSTASIS.

700
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:27,033
SO YOU WERE BEHIND
THE FREEZE SERUM.

701
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:28,817
I HAD NO IDEA MY RESEARCH TEAM

702
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:30,906
WAS CONDUCTING
HUMAN EXPERIMENTS.

703
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,693
I JUST THOUGHT IF I COULD
SIDELINE MARQUIS FOR A WHILE

704
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:37,565
IT WOULD BUY ME SOME
TIME TO FIND A SOLUTION.

705
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,703
HE'S GOING IN FOR ANOTHER BITE.

706
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:46,574
HOW'S THE BURGER, DAD?

707
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:49,272
DELICIOUS.

708
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:54,495
WHAT THE HELL?

709
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,149
UH-OH. HE'S ON TO ME.

710
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:58,456
- IS THAT PEANUT BUTTER?
- HA HA HA!

711
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,634
WHAT'S WRONG?

712
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:05,114
PEANUTS. BURGER.

713
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:08,770
FRANKLIN, WHERE'S YOUR PEN?
WHERE'S YOUR PEN?

714
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:24,046
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

715
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,049
BECAUSE EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE

716
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:29,225
SINCE THE DAY WE MET

717
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:31,706
HAS BEEN TO PROTECT YOU, RYAN.

718
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:38,887
AND BECAUSE I NEED YOUR HELP.

719
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,107
ALL I WANT IS TO STOP MARQUIS

720
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,935
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS HURT.

721
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:14,575
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
