1
00:00:01,088 --> 00:00:03,264
PREVIOUSLY ON "BATWOMAN"...

2
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:04,700
MR. FREEZE'S
LIQUID NITROGEN CAN

3
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:05,938
GOT IN THE HANDS OF
A BUNCH OF EIGHTH GRADERS.

4
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:07,137
I NEED TO FIND IT.

5
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,486
EXPOSURE TO
THE FREEZE SERUM

6
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,053
WILL STOP TIME
AND KEEP YOU FROM AGING.

7
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:11,185
GONNA NEED
A LITTLE HELP.

8
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:13,665
BATWOMAN.

9
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,232
RYAN, WAKE UP!

10
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:20,324
NOT MUCH LEFT, BUT
RENEE WAS WILLING

11
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:22,022
TO CROSS IT OFF HER LIST.

12
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,521
GUESS IT'S SAFE TO
SAY YOU'VE FIGURED OUT

13
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:24,763
THE GLITCHES IN
YOUR SUPERSUIT.

14
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:26,287
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

15
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,786
IT'S BECAUSE HE
DISABLED THE FAILSAFE.

16
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,855
I SHOULDN'T HAVE CLEARED
YOU FOR FIELD DUTY.

17
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,727
IF YOU CONTINUE
TO TRY TO HAVE

18
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,424
ANYTHING TO DO
WITH MY FAMILY,

19
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,861
YOU AND WAYNE ENTERPRISES

20
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:37,254
WILL COME TO SEVERELY

21
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:38,734
REGRET THAT DECISION.

22
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,522
DOES THAT HAPPEN A LOT?
THOSE DELUSIONS?

23
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,089
SO, YOU THINK
YOU KNOW MY STORY.

24
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,135
27. RAISED IN THE SYSTEM.

25
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:49,353
STINT AT BLACKGATE.

26
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:51,834
OH, AND YOU'RE MY SISTER.

27
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,667
AAH!

28
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:26,129
SUBJECT FXJ-1.
REANIMATION PROGRESS CHECK.

29
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:27,478
FINAL PHASE.

30
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:30,351
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

31
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:54,853
REANIMATION FAILURE.
24 HOURS TILL CLIENT DEADLINE.

32
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,512
WHAT THE HELL?

33
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:04,706
WHEN DID IT GET HERE?

34
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:05,750
TRAGICALLY EARLY.

35
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,491
DELIVERY DUDE
WOKE ME OUT OF BED.

36
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:14,324
OK. YEAH.
THIS IS BAD.

37
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:15,934
YEAH, BUT THE PICTURE'S
KIND OF CUTE.

38
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:20,025
"30 UNDER 30."
YOURS TRULY.

39
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,418
I MEAN, I NEED
TO HANG THIS UP.

40
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:22,724
- GIVE ME THE NOTE.
- HERE.

41
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,510
"YOU'RE WELCOME, FAM.

42
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,512
SEE YOU AT THE
PRESS JUNKET. MARQUIS."

43
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:31,036
YOUR BROTHER
GOT YOU ON THE LIST?

44
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,213
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M A RISING STAR.

45
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:34,518
BUT ALSO, HE USED
TO HOOK UP

46
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:36,346
WITH THE EDITOR OF
THE "GAZETTE," SO...

47
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,869
SO, YOU NOW HAVE
A PUBLIC DATE

48
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,369
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS
WITH THE BROTHER

49
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:40,698
THAT YOU HAVE TO
STAY AWAY FROM,

50
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,102
OTHERWISE JADA JET
COMES KNIVES OUT

51
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,266
FOR YOU, WAYNE ENTERPRISES,

52
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,330
MAYBE EVEN YOUR
SECRET IDENTITY.

53
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:45,921
I TRIED TO GHOST HIM, OK,

54
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:49,229
BUT THE WORD IS OUT
AND GOTHAM'S CURIOUS.

55
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,380
YOU KNOW
CHARLIE CLARKE, RIGHT?

56
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,753
HEAD OF PR FOR WAYNE?

57
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,116
OF COURSE.
CHARLIE'S BEEN AT WAYNE

58
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:54,538
SINCE MY DAD
WAS STILL THERE.

59
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:55,539
HE'S ONE OF BRUCE'S
INNER CIRCLE GUYS.

60
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,237
OK, WELL, CHARLIE'S GOTTEN

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,325
DOZENS OF REQUESTS

62
00:03:58,368 --> 00:03:59,369
TO INTERVIEW WAYNE'S

63
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,545
HOT, YOUNG CEO...

64
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,025
THEIR WORDS, NOT MINE...

65
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,568
AND HE SAYS THAT IF
I SKIP OUT ON THIS EVENT,

66
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:05,917
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
REPORTERS TRYING TO CLIMB

67
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,552
THE WALLS OF WAYNE TOWER
TO GET ANSWERS.

68
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:11,555
OK. WHAT'S YOUR
PLAN FOR WHEN

69
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,861
YOU RUN INTO MARQUIS?

70
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:17,648
FEEL THIS SHOULDER.

71
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,564
COME ON. FEEL IT. FEEL IT.

72
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,349
- COLD AS THEY COME
- OK.

73
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:24,525
LOOK, IF I NEED
A CONVO BLOCKER,

74
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,004
SOPHIE'S GONNA BE THERE.

75
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,928
HER SIS IS ON THE LIST
FOR THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

76
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:29,878
OH. THAT IS
LEGITIMATELY COOL.

77
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:33,925
GREAT. YOU BOTH
ARE HERE.

78
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:38,278
CAN I RUN SOMETHING
CRAZY BY YOU?

79
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,801
MY SWEET GIRL.

80
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:41,933
DID YOU GO HOME
WITH A BOY LAST NIGHT?

81
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:44,545
NO. SEE,
THAT'S THE THING.

82
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:45,937
I'M PRETTY SURE
I SPENT THE NIGHT

83
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,069
ASLEEP ON A BENCH

84
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,375
IN THE MIDDLE OF
GOTHAM PARK.

85
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,421
WHOO. SO,
BUSY MORNING.

86
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,771
I SHOULD JET.
PUN INTENDED.

87
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:54,816
GOOD LUCK.

88
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,690
WOULD LUKE STILL
BE THIS UPSET

89
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,302
IF NOTHING WAS
ACTUALLY WRONG?

90
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:06,262
LUKE IS JUST FRUSTRATED.

91
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,611
YOU TOLD ME HIS PTSD

92
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,786
MADE HIM A RISK
IN THE FIELD.

93
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,440
HE JUST WANTS US
TO BE ABLE TO

94
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:11,746
KNOW WE CAN DEPEND ON HIM.

95
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:13,400
DEPEND ON HIM?
YOU MEAN LIKE

96
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:14,836
WHEN YOU WALK INTO
A ROOM AND SAY,

97
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,577
"HEY, SOMETHING
REALLY WEIRD

98
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,361
JUST HAPPENED TO ME.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT?"

99
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,537
HE'LL COME AROUND, OK?

100
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:23,453
BUT I'M HERE TO LISTEN.

101
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:26,848
I HAVE A JAM-PACKED DAY,
SO, CAN WE WALK AND TALK?

102
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:30,808
THEN WE SHOULD
JUST TABLE MY DRAMA,

103
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:34,421
BECAUSE I SORT OF NEED
AN ACTIVE LISTENER HERE.

104
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,074
OK. HOW ABOUT THIS?

105
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,424
I'LL BUY DRINKS
FOR HAPPY HOUR.

106
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,469
THEN YOU CAN UNLOAD?

107
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:43,560
SURE. I'LL JUST
JOURNAL UNTIL THEN.

108
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:04,233
BREATHE. JUST BREATHE.

109
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:07,192
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE IN THE
NORMAN BATES OF PSYCH WARDS,

110
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:09,673
WITH A BILLION
NON-CONSENSUAL NANOBOTS

111
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:11,153
SWIMMING THROUGH
YOUR BLOODSTREAM.

112
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,200
OH, WAIT.

113
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:20,510
YOU'VE GOT MAIL.

114
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,558
I HATE THAT I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO KNOW WHAT YOU DID THERE.

115
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,046
THESE ARE FROM DADDY.

116
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,048
THEY ALL ARE.
AN ENTIRE STACK

117
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,181
FROM OLE JAILCROW
JACOB KANE.

118
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,143
THESE MIS-DELIVERIES
ARE FROM

119
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:48,146
THE WEEPY POST OFFICE
INSIDE MY SICK MIND.

120
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,540
NOW, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A "YOU" PROBLEM.

121
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:55,980
OOH!

122
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,463
EXCUSE ME?

123
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,077
HELP?

124
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,818
KANE?

125
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,559
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

126
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:13,084
EVERYTHING LOOKS
NORMAL TO YOU?

127
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:18,002
ROOM INSPECTIONS ARE
TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS.

128
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:34,323
- WHAT?
- I HAVE JUST ONE MORE THING.

129
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,630
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO RENEE MONTOYA.

130
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,380
LET'S KEEP THINGS
MOVING, CHARLIE.

131
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:49,599
I WANT TO MAKE
AN IMPRESSION,

132
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,296
THEN LEAVE 'EM
WANTING MORE.

133
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,796
GREAT NEWS... THE CHAIRMAN
OF APEX BROADCASTING

134
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,188
GOT AN EEL BONE
STUCK IN HIS THROAT,

135
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,519
SO, THERE'S A PHOTO SESSION
SLOT AVAILABLE.

136
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:57,912
LEAD THE WAY.

137
00:07:57,955 --> 00:07:59,522
WAYNE ENTERPRISES
IS SET TO MAKE

138
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:00,760
ITS BIGGEST QUARTERLY
REVENUE GAINS

139
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,133
IN 6 YEARS.

140
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:03,676
I HAD TO BRIBE MR. WAYNE
WITH BLOODY MARYS

141
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,920
TO GET HIM TO MEMORIZE
HIS TALKING POINTS.

142
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,277
RYAN! RYAN! RYAN!

143
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,887
OVER HERE.

144
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:22,502
YOU WANT TO
LET ME WORK?

145
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,721
I CAN BARELY TELL
YOU'RE SMILING.

146
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,506
COME ON!
SHOW GOTHAM

147
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,203
THAT NEW FIRE
THAT'S TAKING OVER.

148
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,511
RYAN, RYAN.

149
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:35,819
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ISN'T SHE WONDERFUL, FOLKS?

150
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,517
THAT'S MARQUIS JET.
I WANT THE CAMERAS

151
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,822
TO GET A SHOT
OF YOU TOGETHER.

152
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:42,260
THE JETS ARE
ICONS IN THIS CITY.

153
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,699
WHY ARE YOU
AVOIDING ME?

154
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,483
I THOUGHT THAT ONCE I
GOT YOU ON THIS LIST,

155
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,484
YOU KNEW THAT
I WANTED...

156
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,529
TO PISS OFF YOUR MOM.

157
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,921
HEY, I'M JUST MAKING UP

158
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,270
FOR THE MISSED TIME
YOU HAD WITH

159
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:53,837
OUR MOM IN
THE REBELLIOUS PHASE.

160
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,536
IT'S MANIPULATIVE.
AND FRANKLY,

161
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,668
IT PUTS MY BUSINESS
AT RISK.

162
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,278
- LOOK, RYAN...
- HEY, GUYS.

163
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:02,411
CAN I GET A SMILE?

164
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:04,979
I'LL BE
REAL WITH YOU.

165
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:06,720
I JUST WANTED TO DO
A NICE THING

166
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,069
AND HOPEFULLY
HAVE A CHANCE

167
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:09,897
TO HANG OUT WITH
MY SISTER, BUT

168
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,942
IF THAT'S TOO
RISKY FOR YOU...

169
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,685
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.

170
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:19,689
I GOTTA TAKE THIS.
YEAH.

171
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,561
THIS IS LIKE
THE PUBLICIST

172
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,823
HUNGER GAMES.

173
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,128
DID YOU SEE THE SIGN
AT THE BAR

174
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,782
THAT SAYS,
"THE FREE CHAMPAGNE

175
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:27,610
IS FOR NOMINEES ONLY"?

176
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:28,916
YOU WANT ME
TO GET YOU A GLASS,

177
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,458
YOU SHOULD'VE BOUGHT ME
THAT BOX OF WINE

178
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:31,614
I WANTED IN COLLEGE.

179
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,007
OK, AS YOUR BIG SISTER,

180
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,531
I STAND BEHIND
THAT DECISION.

181
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,837
IT'S AS ON BRAND
FOR ME AS BEING

182
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,318
HERE TODAY IS
OFF BRAND FOR YOU.

183
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,732
AS AN HONOREE,
I GET A LITTLE

184
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,584
SPEECH AT
THE PARTY LATER.

185
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,586
TWO MINUTES,
ANYTHING I WANT TO SAY.

186
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,370
MY PLAN IS TO SERENADE
THESE MONEYBAGS INTO

187
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,894
QUADRUPLING THE COMMUNITY
CENTER'S BUDGET.

188
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:52,940
IT'S A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
SHOT, RIGHT?

189
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,032
THAT'S MY
"UNDER 30" BESTIE.

190
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:01,470
ALWAYS GOT HER EYE
ON THE PRIZE, AND, UM...

191
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,695
IT MUST RUN
IN THE FAMILY.

192
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,613
UM, I HAVE SOMETHING

193
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,615
EMBARRASSING TO
TELL YOU.

194
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,878
I AM SO IN.

195
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,967
I HAD A DREAM
ABOUT RYAN.

196
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,099
- OK.
- I WAS IN BED.

197
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:25,102
- OK.
- AND I MUST HAVE BEEN SICK, BECAUSE

198
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:27,191
SHE BROUGHT ME
SOME SOUP.

199
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,410
WHAT KIND OF SOUP?

200
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:31,195
I WOKE UP BEFORE I
COULD EVEN TRY IT.

201
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,241
WHAT?

202
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:34,285
YOU WOKE UP EARLY.

203
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,723
IT'S A CLASSIC DREAM
ABOUT LONGING.

204
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:37,941
I KNEW YOU
REALLY LIKED HER.

205
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:39,682
WHY DID I TELL YOU THIS?

206
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:43,947
JORDAN, IT WASN'T A SEXUAL DREAM.
AT ALL.

207
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:46,254
DID RYAN BRING
A FLOWER WITH THE SOUP?

208
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:48,822
TOLD YA.

209
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:50,998
HEY. I'M 31,
I HAVE NO CAREER,

210
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,695
AND I AM SURROUNDED
BY ALL YOU

211
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,741
SICK, LITTLE PRODIGIES,
AND MY BRAIN

212
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:56,699
IS BEGGING ME,
"HEY, LOSER,

213
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,309
CAN YOU AT LEAST
FIND A GIRLFRIEND?"

214
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:01,704
BUT... THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT HAS TO BE RYAN.

215
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:04,098
OR, AND HEAR ME OUT
ON THIS,

216
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:06,535
RYAN WILDER IS
HOT AS HELL,

217
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:09,103
AND YOU'RE
AMAZING TOGETHER.

218
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:14,021
YOU'RE STARING AGAIN.
I JUST...

219
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:15,718
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE TO GO.

220
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,174
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- TO THE BATHROOM?

221
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:18,808
WORRY ABOUT
YOUR SPEECH.

222
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,076
JORDAN MOORE.

223
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,382
I'M FROM THE "GAZETTE."

224
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,036
WE'RE READY TO SIT
FOR YOUR INTERVIEW.

225
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,908
O-OK, SURE. LET ME
JUST GRAB MY PUBLICIST.

226
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:33,301
THAT WON'T
BE NECESSARY.

227
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,494
VESPER FAIRCHILD IS HOLDING.

228
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:59,066
VESPER, IT'S JADA.

229
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,332
I HAPPENED TO GLANCE
AT LAST WEEK'S RATINGS.

230
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:09,032
OUCH. IT'S A CROWDED
LANDSCAPE, MY DEAR,

231
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,731
BUT I WANT TO HELP YOU
MAKE SOME NOISE.

232
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:15,735
YES, I HAVE A SCOOP.

233
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,655
EXPLAIN THIS NEW
HOBBY TO ME.

234
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:25,222
ONLY IF YOU EXPLAIN
WHY MONTOYA

235
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,311
DROPPED YOU OFF
FOR ME TO BABY-SIT.

236
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:35,580
I HAVE
URGENT INFORMATION

237
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:37,017
TO HELP BATWOMAN RECOVER

238
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,237
THE INFAMOUS
"ZERO-G" SNEAKERS

239
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:42,674
USED BY BATMAN'S
LONG-AGO FALLEN

240
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:45,547
AND TRAGICALLY
ARROGANT FOE

241
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,635
THE MIGHTY ICARUS.

242
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:48,071
ICARUS?

243
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,247
SOUNDS LIKE A DEEP CUT.

244
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,901
ACTUALLY,
IT'S FAKE, BUT

245
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,009
SHE'LL BELIEVE
ANYTHING IF YOU

246
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,730
LOWER YOUR VOICE
AN OCTAVE.

247
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,340
IT'S CONVINCING, RIGHT?

248
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,168
CONVINCE ME

249
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,517
NOT TO TELL MONTOYA THAT

250
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:01,432
THERE IS NO MIGHTY ICARUS.

251
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:03,870
WELL, FOR ONE,
YOU'RE LONELY.

252
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:06,089
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
DO EACH OTHER'S NAILS

253
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,439
OR TRY A FEW
ELECTIVE SURGERIES.

254
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:10,920
MM-HMM. THERE HAS TO
BE SOME REASON

255
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:13,227
WHY YOU'RE PLAYING
HOOKY FROM ARKHAM.

256
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:18,275
UHH. WELL, I HATE
TO ADMIT ANYTHING

257
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,887
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
SOUND WEAK,

258
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,803
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

259
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,805
I'M HERE TO DO
BATWOMAN A FAVOR.

260
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:29,112
MM. WELL, KEEP GOING.

261
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,592
SO FAR, THIS STORY'S
BETTER THAN

262
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,072
YOUR NANOBOT COLD.

263
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,336
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

264
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,338
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT TROPHY

265
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,470
THE BAT TEAM IS
HEROICALLY TRACKING DOWN

266
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,037
AT THIS VERY MOMENT
TO KEEP

267
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,386
THE GOTHAM STREETS SAFE

268
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,953
AND APPEASE
THE TYRANT THAT IS

269
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,955
FORCING US
TO WORK TOGETHER?

270
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,478
SOMETHING CAME UP.

271
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:49,916
WE'LL GET BACK TO
RENEE'S TREASURE HUNT TOMORROW.

272
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,875
HMM. NO JUDGMENT
HERE, BUT

273
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,921
I WONDER IF
RENEE WOULD BE AS

274
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,879
GENEROUS TOWARD
THIS WHOLE

275
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,186
WORK-LIFE BALANCE?

276
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:02,058
I GUESS YOU'LL FIND OUT
WHEN YOU CALL HER.

277
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:06,323
FINE. YOU WIN. JUST...

278
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:10,284
DON'T BOTHER ANYONE
WHO COMES IN.

279
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,988
THANK YOU.

280
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:23,142
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE
NEVER HAD MEDIA TRAINING.

281
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,342
JUST HIGHLY MOTIVATED.
WHO'S NEXT?

282
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:27,040
LET ME SHOOT THE
"GAZETTE" A QUICK TEXT

283
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,651
AND SEE IF THEY'RE
READY FOR YOU.

284
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:31,566
FIGURED YOU'D CHILL IF
I BOUGHT A DISGUISE,

285
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:34,351
SO, THEY HAD THIS SICK
COLORWAY AT THE GIFT SHOP.

286
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:37,267
"WHO'S THAN MAN
WITH RYAN WILDER?

287
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,661
IS HE HANDSOME?
I CAN'T TELL."

288
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,378
YEAH, YOU PROBABLY
SHOULDA GOT SOME AVIATORS.

289
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,186
I SHOULD'VE.
THEY'RE TWO-FOR-ONE.

290
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,928
- DO YOU WANT IN?

291
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,974
HEY, RYAN,
HAVE YOU SEEN JORDAN?

292
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:48,975
SHE'S LATE FOR
AN INTERVIEW

293
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,150
AND HER PHONE IS OFF.

294
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:51,151
NEVER LET THE CLIENT

295
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,543
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

296
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,371
I'M MORE PUBLISISTER
THAN PUBLICIST, SO...

297
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,504
I'D HAVE GUESSED PRINT MODEL.

298
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,375
COOL HAT.

299
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,987
MARQUIS JET.
I'M RYAN'S BROTHER.

300
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,597
SOPHIE MOORE. RYAN'S...

301
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,164
VERY GOOD FRIEND
WHO NEEDS HELP

302
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:05,817
FINDING HER
BABY SISTER.

303
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,558
THE "GAZETTE"
SAYS THEY'RE READY FOR YOU.

304
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:09,517
CAN WE PUSH THIS OFF
UNTIL AFTER THE INTERVIEW?

305
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,735
MY GIRL COMES FIRST.

306
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:12,104
SEE IF THAT DUDE GOT
RID OF THE EEL BONE YET.

307
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,390
COME ON.
LET'S GO.

308
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,921
OK. REBOOTING...

309
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,097
VOICE INTERFACE.

310
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,489
REBOOTING SYSTEM LOADER.

311
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:31,147
DAD? IT'S LUKE.
ARE YOU THERE?

312
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,984
THE SILENT TREATMENT'S
GETTING OLD.

313
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,572
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
LEAVE ME HANGING WITH THE MOST

314
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:48,295
SOPHISTICATED PERSONAL
FLIGHT SUIT ON THE PLANET?

315
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:57,957
IS THIS ABOUT
THE FAILSAFE?

316
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,151
YOU'RE MAD BECAUSE
I TURNED IT OFF?

317
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:00,220
BECAUSE THAT'S ON YOU.

318
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:02,048
IT MALFUNCTIONED. SO...

319
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,749
YOU KNOW, IT ALSO
ALMOST GOT ME KILLED,

320
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:10,230
SO, NO, I'M NOT
TURNING IT BACK ON.

321
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:12,884
MY SUIT, MY DECISION.

322
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,974
BATWOMAN TO BATCAVE.
YOU THERE?

323
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:19,979
YEAH, JUST...
TALKING TO MY WARDROBE.

324
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,197
HAVING A NORMAL ONE.

325
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,332
BATWOMAN. HEY.

326
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,029
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TAKING A PERSONAL DAY.

327
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,031
I NEED AN ASSIST.

328
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,728
SOPHIE'S SISTER JORDAN
IS M.I.A.

329
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,339
TOO MANY MAI TAIS
AT THE OPEN BAR?

330
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:34,123
OH, I HOPE NOT.
I CLEANED UP ENOUGH

331
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,559
PUKE IN MY OLD JOB.

332
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:36,908
I GOT A PING
ON HER CELL PHONE.

333
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,388
SO, LET ME JUST NARROW DOWN

334
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,434
THE LOCATION RADIUS
WITH THE HOTEL WI-FI.

335
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,069
NOT TO BE A DOWNER
AT A PARTY,

336
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,355
BUT IT MIGHT BE
TIME TO PANIC.

337
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,921
IS SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH HER?

338
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:51,836
SHE SEEMED NERVOUS
BUT ONLY BECAUSE

339
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,229
SHE HAD A SPEECH LATER.

340
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:54,665
FACIAL RECOGNITION
SAYS NO JORDAN

341
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,711
ON ANY OF THE EXTERIOR
HOTEL CAMS,

342
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:58,626
SO, SHE MUST STILL BE
ON THE PREMISES.

343
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,107
HEY, I JUST
GOT A TIP

344
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,171
THAT YOUR SISTER
WAS SPOTTED

345
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,500
UPSTAIRS
AT THE HOTEL.

346
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:06,068
SOME MAN BROUGHT HER
INTO ROOM 1620.

347
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,417
LET'S GO.

348
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,853
OK, YOU STAY HERE.
KEEP AN EYE OUT.

349
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:10,464
CALL ME IF SHE
COMES BACK DOWN.

350
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,165
JORDAN?

351
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,862
OH, MY GOD.

352
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,908
NO.
DON'T TOUCH HER.

353
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:21,692
NOT TILL WE KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

354
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,564
WHO THE HELL WOULD
DO THIS TO HER?

355
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,395
I'VE SEEN THIS
EQUIPMENT BEFORE.

356
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,440
THIS IS
MR. FREEZE'S DESIGN.

357
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:33,182
FREEZE SERUM
DID THIS?

358
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,097
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU GOT THAT

359
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,403
STUFF OFF THE STREETS.

360
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,100
I GOT THE ORIGINAL
CANISTER BACK,

361
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:41,103
BUT MAYBE SOMEONE
FOUND MORE.

362
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,800
WHY WOULD THEY
DO THIS TO JORDAN?

363
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,194
AND HOW ARE THEY
DOING THIS

364
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:48,197
WITHOUT A CRYOCHAMBER?

365
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:51,548
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL HANDLE IT.

366
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,333
- I HAVE TO MOVE HER.
- YOU CANNOT

367
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:54,334
WARM HER, SOPHIE.

368
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:55,596
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

369
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,206
THE LAST TIME
SOMEONE TRIED THAT,

370
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,208
SHE AGED AT 4 TIMES
THE NORMAL RATE.

371
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:01,123
THIS IS MY SISTER, RYAN.

372
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,559
SHE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

373
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:07,129
I KNOW. WE WILL FIGURE
THIS OUT TOGETHER.

374
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,399
THE CATALYTIC MECHANISM IS

375
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:17,835
BASED ON
VICTOR FRIES' RESEARCH,

376
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:20,751
BUT WHAT USED TO HAPPEN
INSIDE A CHAMBER

377
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:23,189
IS NOW HAPPENING
INSIDE JORDAN'S CELLS.

378
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:25,408
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
HOW TO UNDO IT.

379
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:27,497
TELL ME HOW TO HELP.

380
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,283
THE MAIN
COMPLICATION THAT WE SEE

381
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,546
WITH FRIES' CRYO-STASIS
IS RAPID AGING,

382
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:37,377
BUT THIS IS SO MUCH
MORE INVASIVE.

383
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,682
IF I HAD TO GUESS

384
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:41,120
WHAT THIS COULD DO
TO ORGANIC TISSUE...

385
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,471
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A PIECE OF

386
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,516
PETRIFIED WOOD BEFORE?

387
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,257
WE SHOULD JUST PAUSE
ON THAT ANALOGY

388
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,259
AND JUST FOCUS.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

389
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,305
WANT ME TO GO TO THE STORE
FOR A HAIR DRYER?

390
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,221
WHY THE HELL IS
ALICE EVEN HERE?

391
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,440
IT'S REALLY NOT EVEN
WORTH EXPLAINING.

392
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:00,574
LOOK, IF I CAN GET
A CLEAN SAMPLE

393
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:01,836
OF THIS NEW
FREEZE SERUM,

394
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,185
I THINK I COULD

395
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,186
FIGURE OUT
A SAFE WAY TO

396
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,448
BRING JORDAN OUT OF CRYO.

397
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,189
THEN WE SHOULD
FIND OUT WHO MADE IT

398
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,451
AND SEE IF
THEY HAVE MORE.

399
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:09,800
WERE THEY WORKING
WITH ANYONE

400
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,585
AT THE HOTEL OR
WITH THE EVENT?

401
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,500
WE SHOULD HAVE LUKE
CHECK EVERY CAMERA SYSTEM

402
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:14,631
TO SEE IF
HE CAN PULL...

403
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:18,418
I GOT IT.
IT'S THE BEE GEES.

404
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:20,594
OF COURSE IT'S THEM.

405
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:23,162
DID YOU TAKE
MY SISTER'S PHONE?

406
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,773
OH. YEAH.
AND, UM, YOU'RE WELCOME.

407
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,818
FOR CRITIQUING
HER STATE IN MUSIC?

408
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:31,518
NO. FOR SOLVING
ALL YOUR LITTLE MYSTERIES.

409
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:32,973
WHO KIDNAPPED JORDAN,
WHO'S EXPERIMENTING

410
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,477
WITH THE FREEZE FORMULA.

411
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:37,872
SAME ANSWER.
THE BLACK GLOVE SOCIETY.

412
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:45,227
THE BGS.
THE BEE GEES.

413
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:49,449
THEY RULE THE CITY
FROM THE SHADOWS.

414
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:51,190
THEY WANT TO LIVE FOREVER.
YOU KNOW.

415
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,322
USUAL BIG-MONEY
PERVERT STUFF.

416
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:55,803
SHE'S RIGHT.
JORDAN AND HER FRIENDS

417
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,370
WERE COLLECTING
INFORMATION ON

418
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,720
SOME BLACK
GLOVE SOCIETY.

419
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,332
SHE WAS GOING
TO USE HER SPEECH

420
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:04,855
FROM THE "30 UNDER 30"

421
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,249
TO UNMASK THE SOCIETY
AND SHUT IT DOWN.

422
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,685
NOW THAT IS
A GREAT WAY TO

423
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,339
MAKE YOURSELF
A TARGET OF GOTHAM'S

424
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:12,646
OLDEST SECRET SOCIETY OF
THE RICH AND POWERFUL.

425
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,213
I'LL SEND THIS
INFO TO LUKE

426
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,364
SO HE CAN CHECK
ON THE OTHERS

427
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:16,780
AND SEE IF
THEY'RE OK.

428
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,659
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU WERE DOING?

429
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:31,230
YOU? SPECIAL AGENT PLAY-IT-SAFE?

430
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,279
SHE KNEW YOU'D TRY TO
TALK HER OUT OF IT.

431
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:42,328
UH, MARY?

432
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:43,981
I DON'T THINK HER
TEMPERATURE'S STABLE.

433
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,293
YOU'RE RIGHT.

434
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:52,903
THE FORMULA MUST BE
BREAKING DOWN

435
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,253
INSIDE OF HER BODY.

436
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,384
UGH. IF I COULD JUST

437
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,168
GET A SAMPLE OF THIS FORMULA,

438
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:58,561
I COULD FIGURE ALL OF THIS OUT.

439
00:20:58,605 --> 00:20:59,712
IT'S TOO BAD
WE CAN'T JUST ASK HER

440
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:01,521
HOW TO FIND THE BEE GEES.

441
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,349
SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY
CLOSE ENOUGH TO SOMETHING

442
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:05,655
FOR THEM TO TURN HER
INTO A POPSICLE.

443
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:06,961
ALICE, YOU'RE
COMING WITH ME.

444
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:08,223
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

445
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,311
I CAN'T JUST
WAIT FOR RYAN

446
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:10,747
TO SOLVE THIS FOR ME.

447
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,401
WE'RE GONNA SEARCH
JORDAN'S APARTMENT.

448
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,118
IF SHE'S GOT ANY OTHER
EVIDENCE ON BLACK GLOVE,

449
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:15,448
IT'LL BE HIDDEN THERE.

450
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,470
JUST GOT THE BLACK GLOVE
FILES FROM SOPHIE.

451
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:20,454
GIVE ME ONE SECOND TO SEE
WHAT JORDAN HAD ON HERE.

452
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:27,938
NOTHING THEY DO
IS DIGITAL.

453
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:29,568
MAYBE THAT'S HOW
THEY STAY OFF THE RADAR.

454
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:31,159
NO COMPUTERS.
NOTHING ON THE CLOUD.

455
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:32,203
NOTHING WE
CAN USE TO GET

456
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:34,075
A NAME OR A LOCATION?

457
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,206
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE

458
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,643
JORDAN WAS TEXTING EARLIER?

459
00:21:36,686 --> 00:21:38,558
M.I.A.
THEY ALL MET UP AT THE HOTEL

460
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,299
BUT THEN THEY ALL WENT DARK.

461
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,622
I BET THAT'S WHY
BLACK GLOVE DOES

462
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,302
THEIR FREEZE EXPERIMENTS
AT THE HOTEL.

463
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,323
ONE-STOP SHOPPING FOR EVERYONE
WHO HAS IT OUT FOR THEM.

464
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,436
OH, MY GOD.
THE CORONER IS TAKING

465
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,873
SOMEONE OUT OF
THE HOTEL IN PIECES.

466
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,788
PROBABLY ONE OF
JORDAN'S TEAM.

467
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:56,140
OK. I'M GOING UP
TO THE HOTEL.

468
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:58,142
WE GOTTA FIND
THE OTHER ONE.

469
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,448
DID YOU HAVE EYES ON MARQUIS

470
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:00,991
AROUND THE TIME THAT
JORDAN WENT MISSING?

471
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:02,973
- WHY?
- BGS IS BIG MONEY.

472
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:05,585
FLASHY GUYS DOING WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO STAY POWERFUL.

473
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:07,630
HE WOULD FIT PERFECTLY
INTO THAT CROWD.

474
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:08,979
FIND YOUR FRIEND'S SISTER?

475
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:10,329
YEAH. I DID. THANKS.

476
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,200
RIGHT WHERE YOU
SAID SHE'D BE.

477
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:13,593
GLAD I COULD
BE OF SERVICE.

478
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:14,985
I BET HE IS.

479
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:16,180
HOW'D HE KNOW
WHICH ROOM JORDAN WAS IN

480
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:17,988
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

481
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:19,990
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND HER?

482
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:22,384
I KNOW A GIRL WHO WORKS
AT THE FRONT DESK.

483
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,864
SHE ASKED AROUND FOR ME.

484
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,407
ONE OF THE HOUSEKEEPERS
SAID THAT SHE SAW

485
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,582
SOMEONE WHO LOOKED
LIKE JORDAN

486
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:27,563
BEING LED INTO
A BEDROOM

487
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:28,651
BY SOME OLDER GUY.

488
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:30,871
I'M NOT ACCUSING YOU. OK?

489
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:31,915
BUT LIKE I SAID,

490
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,395
I DON'T REALLY
KNOW YOU, MARQUIS.

491
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:35,005
I ACTUALLY
CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

492
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:36,572
FOR WHAT?

493
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,922
YOU THINK JADA'S
CRAZY, ANGRY,

494
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,316
CONTROL-FREAK THING
IS SOMETHING NEW?

495
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,839
THIS HAS BEEN
MY WHOLE LIFE.

496
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:47,583
ONLY CHILD. I WANTED
TO KNOW YOU SO BAD.

497
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:50,499
I THOUGHT,
FINALLY, MY SISTER.

498
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,153
WE GOT
EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

499
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:53,415
BUT I GUESS NOT.

500
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,679
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

501
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:59,421
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT
AFTER WE HELP JORDAN.

502
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:01,007
IS YOUR PHONE SERIOUSLY
NOT ON RIGHT NOW?

503
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,251
CHARLIE, SORRY.
SHE'S ON SILENT.

504
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:04,557
LOOK, I JUST
RAN INTO SOME

505
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,751
MOVERS AND SHAKERS
AT THE HOTEL,

506
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:07,211
SO, I GOTTA GET BACK
TO IT, OK?

507
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,474
LOOK.

508
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,479
RYAN, WHY IS HE SO PISSED?

509
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:19,895
BUILD YOU UP JUST SO
THEY CAN KNOCK YOU DOWN.

510
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,488
OK. BETTER GIVE ME
THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.

511
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,490
5 MINUTES AGO,
VESPER FAIRCHILD

512
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:25,795
BROKE THE SCOOP
THAT THE CEO

513
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,493
OF WAYNE ENTERPRISES
HAS BEEN DIVERTING

514
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:28,798
TENS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS

515
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:31,235
INTO SECRET ACCOUNTS
FOR HER OWN USE.

516
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,541
JADA.

517
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:34,456
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH OUR CFO.

518
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,820
HE'S STARTED DOING
AN AUDIT OF OUR

519
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,285
ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS
AND HE AGREES

520
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:38,547
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM.

521
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:41,071
WHAT? NO.
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

522
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:42,986
OK, LOOK.
I WILL TALK TO HIM

523
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,598
AND SORT THIS OUT,
BUT JUST NOT RIGHT NOW.

524
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:48,209
OH, DO YOU HAVE A MORE
DESPERATE CRISIS?

525
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,471
THEY SAY MULTITASKING IS

526
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:50,603
THE HARDEST PART
OF THE JOB.

527
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,474
NOT FOR MUCH LONGER.

528
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,258
OK. DON'T WORRY.

529
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,609
I WILL GET A BOX FOR
MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

530
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,088
GIRL, WHEN YOU CATCH
BERNIE MADOFF...

531
00:23:58,132 --> 00:24:00,090
IN THIS CASE, YOU...
STEALING MONEY,

532
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:01,352
YOU DON'T FIRE HER.

533
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:02,745
YOU ARREST HER.

534
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,808
TELL ME SOMETHING
GOOD, LUKE.

535
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:23,766
MAYBE LIKE JADA JET
HACKED OUR SYSTEMS

536
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,420
AND FAKED ALL THAT
HIDDEN MONEY.

537
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,813
RYAN, SHE DIDN'T FAKE THIS.

538
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,510
WHY AM I THE LAST PERSON
TO KNOW THAT

539
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:29,729
I HAVE 8 FIGURES STASHED

540
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,121
UNDER A MATTRESS SOMEWHERE?

541
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:32,949
CAN YOU THINK OF
ANY OPERATIONS THAT

542
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:34,821
ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE,
SECRETIVE,

543
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:35,996
AND CAN ONLY
BE AUTHORIZED BY

544
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,998
THE CEO OF
WAYNE ENTERPRISES?

545
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:41,915
BATMAN. AND NOW BATWOMAN.

546
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,569
THAT MONEY IS OUR
OPERATING BUDGET.

547
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:45,266
LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW JADA GOT ACCESS

548
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:47,964
TO OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS,
SO, THE ONLY GOOD NEWS IS

549
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,464
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
THE MONEY IS FOR,

550
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,534
JUST THAT SHE COULD
PIN IT ON YOU.

551
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,623
LUKE, I GIVE UP.

552
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,972
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

553
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,452
THE COPS COULD
WALK IN ANY SECOND

554
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,193
AND I'M FREEZING
MY ASS OFF.

555
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:02,762
GCPD HAS THERMAL
IMAGING CAMERAS

556
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,154
ALL OVER THE CITY.

557
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:05,654
LET ME TAP IN, SEE IF
ANY OF THE OTHER ROOMS

558
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:06,983
HAVE ABNORMAL TEMPERATURES.

559
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,899
I'M NOT SEEING
ANY ICE BOXES.

560
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,989
LUKE? I'M SEEING A BUNCH
OF HEAT LAMPS HERE.

561
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,208
MAYBE THEY WERE GETTING READY

562
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:15,557
TO TRY THAWING HER.

563
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:16,882
IF THEY DID THAT
IN ANOTHER ROOM...

564
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:18,386
THEN ON THERMAL IMAGING
IT WOULD LOOK

565
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:20,867
MORE LIKE A SAUNA.

566
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,827
OK. BINGO.
GET READY TO SUIT UP.

567
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:27,526
OHH.

568
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,571
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

569
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:31,007
DEAD BODY.

570
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:33,270
THEY TRIED TO UNFREEZE IT.
DIDN'T WORK.

571
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,543
POSITIVE I.D.
SHE'S THE OTHER ONE

572
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,761
IN JORDAN'S GROUP TEXT.

573
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:48,938
NO SIGN OF BLACK GLOVE.

574
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,030
I JUST RAN THE NAME OF THE
OTHER GUY IN THE GROUP TEXT.

575
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:55,684
ACCORDING TO THE GCPD,
HE WAS THE ONE

576
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,512
THEY JUST WHEELED
OUT OF THERE.

577
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,905
JORDAN'S THE ONLY
ONE LEFT.

578
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:07,609
HEY, NO SASS.
YOU LIVED IN A SEWER.

579
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,132
I'LL TAKE THE BEDROOM.
REMEMBER,

580
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:10,699
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
ANYTHING LOW-TECH.

581
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:12,658
ANYTHING CONNECTED
TO BLACK GLOVE.

582
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:13,809
IF JORDAN KNEW
IT WAS DANGEROUS,

583
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,312
IT WON'T BE
OUT IN THE OPEN.

584
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:25,758
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

585
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,722
HOW'S YOUR NECK?

586
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:37,291
THAT'S HURTFUL.

587
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,336
ARE YOU
TALKING TO SOMEONE?

588
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,512
OH, NO. HEH.

589
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:42,688
NO, I JUST LIKE TO

590
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:43,950
SAY THE DETAILS OUT LOUD.

591
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,647
PLEASE RESPECT
MY PROCESS AND

592
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:46,953
GO BACK TO
PICKING THROUGH

593
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:48,694
YOUR SISTER'S
UNDERWEAR DRAWER.

594
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:51,000
GO, GO.

595
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,052
YOU WANT MY TWO CENTS?

596
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,447
FIRST OF ALL,
THEY'RE MY TWO CENTS.

597
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,972
SECOND OF ALL, SHUT UP.
I'M WORKING.

598
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,061
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO READ
THOSE POSTCARDS.

599
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:10,890
YOU DON'T LIKE FEELING
THOSE LITTLE MACHINES

600
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,935
SWIM AROUND IN YOU
LIKE GUPPIES.

601
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:15,895
YOU BROKE MY DAMN NECK.

602
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,768
I'M SORRY.
DO I SEEM

603
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,683
A TEENSY BIT ON EDGE?

604
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:23,642
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
THE FABRIC OF MY REALITY

605
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,382
IS COLLAPSING AROUND ME!

606
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:27,863
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
KEEPING IT TOGETHER IN THERE?

607
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:30,213
OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW,

608
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:31,911
JUST OVERCOMING
THE MOLD OF YOUR

609
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:35,175
SISTER'S DUSTY
MANIFESTOS.

610
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:37,719
MAYBE IF YOU KNEW
WHAT WAS REAL ABOUT

611
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:39,005
YOURSELF, BETH...

612
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:43,792
THE REST OF THE WORLD
WOULD FALL BACK INTO PLACE.

613
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:09,862
SHE UNMASKED THE BEE GEES.

614
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:13,517
OH, WOW.

615
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:15,041
THAT DOESN'T
BELONG TO YOU.

616
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,697
THANKS FOR THE WARNING.

617
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:25,007
JUST TAKING A SHOT HERE.

618
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:26,443
ARE YOU MAKE-BELIEVE?

619
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:29,205
I'M HERE FOR
EVERYTHING THAT WAS

620
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:30,839
SCANNED INTO
THE GIRL'S PHONE.

621
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,933
PRO TIP...

622
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:40,762
BUY A DOCUMENT SHREDDER.

623
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:49,336
AAH!

624
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:26,982
WHAT'S UP, LUKE?

625
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:28,114
YOU DIDN'T GIVE US
AN UPDATE

626
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:30,812
ON YOUR PROGRESS
WITH JORDAN.

627
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,118
I'M TRYING TO
KEEP HER STABLE

628
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,225
UNTIL SOMEONE
COMES THROUGH WITH

629
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:34,685
A SAMPLE OF
THE FORMULA.

630
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:35,837
YOU'VE HAD HER
LONG ENOUGH TO ANALYZE

631
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:36,925
EVERY ANGLE,
RUN EVERY TEST,

632
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:38,080
AND YOU'VE STILL
GOT NOTHING?

633
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:40,256
WOW. NO PRESSURE, HUH?

634
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,104
IF YOU GET TO JUDGE ME FOR HOW
I'M PERFORMING IN THE CLUTCH,

635
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,782
WHY CAN'T I DO
THE SAME FOR YOU?

636
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:44,913
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU,

637
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:46,306
NOT SCORE POINTS IN SOME

638
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,134
"WHO'S THE BEST HERO"
COMPETITION.

639
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:49,613
LOOK, I'M NOT
DUNKING ON YOU.

640
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:50,919
I'M JUST REMINDING YOU
THAT YOU

641
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,616
DECLARED YOURSELF
TEAM DOCTOR.

642
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,792
YEAH. I'M TRYING.

643
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,228
BUT I CAN BARELY
SEE STRAIGHT

644
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:57,056
BECAUSE I SPENT
THE NIGHT IN THE PARK,

645
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,146
WHICH NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT
BECAUSE NOBODY ACTUALLY CARES.

646
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,367
WHAT IS IT?

647
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:06,282
I CAN HEAR IT.
YOU JUST GOT AN IDEA, RIGHT?

648
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:09,285
ANIMALS NEVER EVOLVED
TO WITHSTAND FREEZING,

649
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:11,766
BUT PLANTS HAVE
ORGANIC MATERIAL

650
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,811
THAT'S PERFECTLY ADAPTED

651
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,247
TO FREEZING AND THAWING.

652
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,727
AND THEY SURVIVE WINTER
BY SYNTHESIZING

653
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,120
A TYPE OF ANTIFREEZE

654
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:20,253
INSIDE THEIR
VASCULAR TISSUE.

655
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:25,693
THE KEY IS TO THAW
FROM THE INSIDE,

656
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:27,260
NOT THE OUTSIDE.

657
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:28,672
AND YOU THINK THIS
COULD BE A WAY TO

658
00:30:28,696 --> 00:30:30,002
SAFELY UNFREEZE JORDAN?

659
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,788
NO. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS

660
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,485
A FUN FACT ABOUT PLANTS.

661
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:46,018
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

662
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,497
GASOLINE.

663
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:52,546
ALICE. ALICE!

664
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,861
THAT'S A LITTLE
ON THE NOSE, BUT

665
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:05,211
THE BOOKS ARE
A NICE TOUCH.

666
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:06,865
HEY, WHERE'S YOUR KNIFE?

667
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,431
THE BEE GEES TOOK IT,

668
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:09,868
ALONG WITH ALL
THE EVIDENCE I FOUND

669
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,173
IN JORDAN'S HIDEY HOLE.

670
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:12,542
STOP TRYING TO MAKE
"BEE GEES" HAPPEN!

671
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:14,873
JEEZ. MISDIRECTED
ANGER, MUCH?

672
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,222
MISDIRECTED?

673
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:18,354
THIS IS COMPLETELY
YOUR FAULT.

674
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:20,052
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE ALICE,

675
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:21,531
A LEGIT SUPER VILLAIN.

676
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:23,490
THE ONLY REASON
THESE GUYS JUMPED YOU

677
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,946
IS BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE TALKING TO

678
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,841
SOME GUY WHO
WASN'T EVEN THERE.

679
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,277
YEAH, I NOTICED.

680
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:32,412
SOMETIMES, I...

681
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,022
I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S
REAL AND WHAT'S NOT,

682
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:35,086
AND IT USED TO ONLY
HAPPEN AT ARKHAM,

683
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,198
BUT IT'S GETTING WORSE

684
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:38,374
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

685
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:40,507
AND I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
WHO WANTS TO HELP ME.

686
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,426
OH, THAT'S ONE WAY
TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM.

687
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:47,688
SORRY, JORDAN.

688
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,722
HEY. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

689
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:27,989
I WISH YOU HAD
TOLD ME.

690
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,295
I COULD'VE HELPED.

691
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:35,954
I WILL ALWAYS
SUPPORT YOU, JORDAN.

692
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,216
ALWAYS.

693
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:41,785
SHE'LL NEED
SOME MORE TIME

694
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,874
BEFORE SHE CAN TALK AGAIN.

695
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:46,790
HER ENTIRE BODY IS RESETTING.

696
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:49,141
AND I'M NOT GONNA LIE,
SHE MIGHT SMELL LIKE

697
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:51,012
CILANTRO FOR THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS,

698
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:53,319
BUT SHE'S GONNA MAKE
A FULL RECOVERY.

699
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:55,016
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

700
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,409
CAN WE EAT NOW?

701
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:02,806
I AM SO SORRY, SOPH.

702
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,634
I SAID I'D HANDLE THIS.

703
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,264
AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE

704
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:08,508
OR WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WITH THE FREEZE SERUM.

705
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:09,726
JORDAN'S OK.

706
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,815
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

707
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:13,489
SO, HOW DID YOU KNOW
TO COME TO THE APARTMENT?

708
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,123
LUKE FIGURED OUT
THEY WERE AFTER

709
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:18,213
THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS
JORDAN HAD ON HER PHONE.

710
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:19,998
I'M NOT GOING TO LET
BLACK GLOVE

711
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,303
GET ANOTHER SHOT
AT HER.

712
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:22,348
YEAH, WELL, THEY ALMOST

713
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:23,740
BURNED ME AT THE STAKE,

714
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:25,786
SO, YOU'RE GETTING
MY HELP ON THIS.

715
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:27,222
AND ALICE'S, TOO,

716
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:29,094
WHETHER WE WANT IT
OR NOT.

717
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,141
MARY.

718
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:35,448
SO, ALICE TOLD ME

719
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,363
HER PSYCHOSIS
IS GETTING WORSE

720
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:39,843
AND SHE SUSPECTS
THE DOCTORS DON'T CARE.

721
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:41,541
HONESTLY?

722
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:42,846
IT'S ARKHAM.

723
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,302
WHATEVER MEDS
THEY'RE GIVING HER IN THERE

724
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:45,936
COULD BE CAUSING
A PSYCHOTIC BREAK

725
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,155
INSTEAD OF CURING IT.

726
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:49,375
IT'S GOING TO BE
EVERYONE'S PROBLEM

727
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:51,029
IF ALICE FULLY
LOSES HER MIND

728
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:53,118
BEFORE WE FINISH
THE JOB FOR MONTOYA.

729
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:54,206
BUT

730
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:55,685
HYPOTHETICALLY,

731
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:58,166
I COULD GET A SUPERVISED

732
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,950
WORK RELEASE FROM ARKHAM

733
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:02,127
AND SWEET MARY COULD MAKE SURE

734
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,606
I WAS TAKING MY PROPER MEDS.

735
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,435
I'M SURE THAT RY-RY
COULD CONVINCE RENEE-NAY

736
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,046
IT WAS FOR THE BEST.

737
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,658
YOU KNOW, ALL FOR THE
SAKE OF FIGHTING CRIME.

738
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:13,964
RIGHT. AND WHO'S
GONNA PUT UP WITH

739
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:15,401
THAT BABY-SITTING JOB?

740
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,796
SOMEONE WHO SLEEPS WITH
A GUN UNDER HER PILLOW.

741
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:24,714
WHAT DO YOU
SAY? ROOMIES!

742
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,811
HOW'S THE
OTHER CRISIS?

743
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:36,117
RESOLVED.

744
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:37,727
SO, YOU'LL BE
ONE-FOR-TWO TODAY.

745
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,227
YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU'RE HERE TO GIVE ME

746
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:41,122
BEST PRACTICES
FOR A PERP WALK,

747
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,081
BUT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

748
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,083
I DID NOTHING WRONG.

749
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,520
OH, I BELIEVE YOU.

750
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:48,932
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ON
THE JOB LONG ENOUGH

751
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:50,000
TO EMBEZZLE
A STAPLER,

752
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:52,394
LET ALONE
$30 MILLION.

753
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:54,396
I THINK YOU MADE THE
WRONG PERSON YOUR ENEMY

754
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,181
AND NOW YOU ARE
THE FALL GAL

755
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:57,704
FOR BRUCE WAYNE'S
MISDEEDS.

756
00:34:58,835 --> 00:34:59,923
YOU THINK BRUCE WAYNE

757
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,882
STOLE FROM
HIS OWN COMPANY?

758
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,405
MR. WAYNE'S LEGACY

759
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:04,928
HAS BEEN
COMPLICATED SINCE

760
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,278
HE TOOK OVER
THE COMPANY.

761
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:09,150
WITH HIS ADDICTIONS,
MISBEHAVIORS,

762
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,021
AND DISAPPEARANCES,

763
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,240
LET'S JUST SAY

764
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:14,112
I'M USED TO
THE CHALLENGE OF

765
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:15,635
PUTTING LIPSTICK
ON A PIG.

766
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,552
WHAT'S THIS?

767
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:20,770
PRESS RELEASE
THAT WILL GO OUT

768
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:21,815
IN THE MORNING.

769
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:23,251
AFTER A THOROUGH REVIEW,

770
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:24,750
IT WAS DETERMINED
THAT THE MISSING MONEY

771
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:26,472
WAS PART OF A TOP-SECRET
DEFENSE CONTRACT

772
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:28,648
THAT YOU NEGOTIATED
WITH ARGUS.

773
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:30,650
CEO WILDER THOUGHT NO ONE
COULD KNOW ABOUT THIS

774
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:32,173
FOR NATIONAL
SECURITY REASONS,

775
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,436
AND DEEPLY REGRETS
NOT ALERTING

776
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,872
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

777
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:38,310
ARGUS IS GONNA
GO ALONG WITH THIS STORY?

778
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:39,441
I HAVE
AN OLD FRIEND THERE.

779
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:40,747
HE'S DOING ME A FAVOR.

780
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:45,317
OK. THAT'S IT?
CRISIS AVERTED?

781
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,753
UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

782
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:49,886
THE STOCK PRICE
IS STILL CRATERING

783
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,540
BECAUSE SOMEONE

784
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:52,976
IS COORDINATING A CAMPAIGN

785
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,891
TO UNDERMINE
SHAREHOLDER CONFIDENCE.

786
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,284
IF WE DON'T
DO SOMETHING

787
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:57,938
TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE,
WE ARE AT RISK

788
00:35:57,981 --> 00:35:59,896
OF A HOSTILE TAKEOVER.

789
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,246
THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS IS

790
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,769
DEMANDING YOUR RESIGNATION.

791
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,640
IT IS THE BEST SHOT
WE HAVE

792
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:06,294
AT CONTAINING THE CRISIS.

793
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:09,863
OK, CHARLIE.

794
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:12,822
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO?

795
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:16,304
THAT'S UP TO YOU,
MS. WILDER.

796
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,094
BUT IN MY OPINION,

797
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:25,270
IF YOU REMAIN AS CEO,

798
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:26,749
WE WILL LOSE
THE COMPANY.

799
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:35,671
WELL, WE KNEW SHE WAS
CAPABLE OF THIS.

800
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:39,849
DID WE? BECAUSE
I'M NOT EVEN CLEAR

801
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:43,070
WHY THE WOMAN HATES ME SO DAMN MUCH.
I'M HER DAUGHTER!

802
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:45,507
AND I TOLD YOU THAT
DOES NOT MATTER TO HER.

803
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,686
OK, LOOK.

804
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:56,039
BRUCE WAS THE FACE
OF WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

805
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,693
BUT MY DAD
WAS HIS PARTNER.

806
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:59,217
AND BRUCE WOULD
ALWAYS SAY THAT

807
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,218
THE COMPANY
BELONGED TO LUCIUS

808
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:01,610
AS MUCH AS IT DID HIM.

809
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,223
RYAN, I CANNOT
LOSE THIS PLACE.

810
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,572
YOU THINK I CAN?

811
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:11,098
WHAT HAPPENS TO BATWOMAN
IF THERE'S NO CASH

812
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:12,752
TO PUT GAS
IN THE BATMOBILE?

813
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:17,278
I AM NOT LETTING
JADA TAKE MY CALLING.

814
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:18,758
SO, WHAT?
SO, EVEN THOUGH

815
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,063
NOBODY THINKS THAT
YOU'LL WIN,

816
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:21,326
YOU'RE JUST GONNA...

817
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:23,850
STAY AND FIGHT?

818
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,592
HAVE YOU MET ME?

819
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,640
OK.

820
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:36,428
FAILSAFE SUBROUTINE...
REACTIVATED.

821
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:39,039
NOW LET'S POWER CYCLE
THE BOOT LOADER.

822
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:42,260
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, SON.

823
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:43,478
DAD?

824
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,438
OH, MY GOD. UM...

825
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:50,093
I REALLY NEEDED
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

826
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:51,704
SO, THE COMPANY'S
UNDER ATTACK

827
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:54,315
AND I FEEL LIKE IF
WE LOSE WAYNE ENTERPRISES,

828
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:55,379
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER
PIECE OF YOU THAT'S

829
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:56,448
GONE FROM MY LIFE.

830
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:57,666
HELPING WAYNE ENTERPRISES

831
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,972
IS BEYOND THE SCOPE

832
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:00,234
OF WHAT I CAN HELP WITH.

833
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,496
YEAH. I KNOW.

834
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,106
WE'RE ALREADY
MAKING A PLAN.

835
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,282
I JUST... I NEEDED TO KNOW

836
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,389
WHY YOU STOPPED
TALKING TO ME.

837
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:06,936
YOU REPAIRED THE SYSTEM

838
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,286
FAULT IN THE O.S.

839
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,939
THAT HAD BEEN
BLOCKING THIS A.I.

840
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:11,376
FROM NORMAL OPERATION.

841
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:12,614
I DIDN'T REPAIR ANYTHING.
I JUST

842
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:13,813
TURNED THE FAILSAFE
BACK ON.

843
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,336
LUCAS, THIS A.I.

844
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,598
IS NOT DESIGNED TO RUN

845
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:18,426
INDEPENDENT OF
THE FAILSAFE.

846
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,601
IT HAS NO PURPOSE

847
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,255
IF IT'S NOT
EMPOWERED TO ACT

848
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,778
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.

849
00:38:22,822 --> 00:38:24,737
RIGHT. OK, SO,

850
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,782
ONCE A DAD, ALWAYS A DAD.

851
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:29,959
WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO ASK ME?

852
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,918
WELL, A FRIEND OF MINE

853
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,442
KIND OF ALREADY
GAVE ME THE ANSWER, BUT...

854
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:38,707
I NEED TO HEAR IT
FROM THE MAN HIMSELF.

855
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,797
UM...

856
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:52,286
I'M NOT READY TO WEAR
THE SUIT, AM I?

857
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,594
NO, SON.
YOU'RE NOT.

858
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:06,996
SO, WHY'D YOU HAVE ME
MEET YOU HERE?

859
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,476
NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE?

860
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:13,351
JADA WANTS WAYNE
ENTERPRISES, DOESN'T SHE?

861
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,657
LOOK... I'M SORRY

862
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:17,050
YOU HAD TO FACE
JADA'S WRATH,

863
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:19,531
AND THAT I HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT,

864
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:21,489
BUT SHE'S HAD ME SIGN

865
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,230
A THOUSAND NDAs OVER THE YEARS,

866
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:24,666
SO, CAN'T REALLY
TALK ABOUT

867
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,102
COMPANY BUSINESS.

868
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,190
WHAT HAPPENED
TO SIBLINGS

869
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,627
HAVING EACH
OTHER'S BACKS?

870
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:32,674
WHAT HAPPENED WAS YOU
WEREN'T INTERESTED.

871
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:34,763
I AM NOT LETTING OUR MOM

872
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:41,379
TAKE OVER
WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

873
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,597
DO YOU THINK
THE TWO OF US

874
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,904
COULD STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST JADA?

875
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,906
IF WE PLEDGED
TO WORK TOGETHER.

876
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:54,043
IT'S DEADLINE DAY,
MY FRIEND.

877
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:55,088
WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

878
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,874
I HAVE THE ANSWER
YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR.

879
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:12,540
AND IT WORKS
THE WAY I ASKED?

880
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:15,064
IT WASN'T AN EASY PROCESS,
BUT YES.

881
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,676
WE WERE ABLE TO ADAPT
VICTOR FRIES' RESEARCH

882
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,547
INTO A NEW FORMULA

883
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:22,289
THAT CAN SAFELY
FREEZE AND UNFREEZE

884
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:24,465
ORGANIC MATERIAL.

885
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,598
WHAT MADE THE PROCESS
SO DIFFICULT?

886
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:31,211
OUR ARRANGEMENT IS
THE BLACK GLOVE SOCIETY

887
00:40:31,254 --> 00:40:33,561
COMMISSIONS US TO
ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE.

888
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:35,345
BUT OUR TERMS
WERE NON-NEGOTIABLE.

889
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,739
YOU DO NOT INQUIRE
ABOUT OUR METHODS,

890
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:39,611
NOR OUR IDENTITIES.

891
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,788
YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT LINES YOU CROSS

892
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:44,616
TO "ACHIEVE
THE IMPOSSIBLE."

893
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,576
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT LINE I CROSSED?

894
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:51,492
THE FINAL BREAKTHROUGH
CAME FROM

895
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:53,233
A RIVAL RESEARCH TEAM.

896
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:55,757
I STOLE THEIR IDEA.

897
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,500
AS LONG AS THAT'S
THE EXTENT OF IT,

898
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,763
I'M A VERY
HAPPY CUSTOMER.

899
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:02,764
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH A LITTLE

900
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:04,592
CORPORATE ESPIONAGE.

901
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:07,465
SO. NOW THAT YOU
HAVE THE ABILITY

902
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:11,512
TO PUT ANYONE'S LIFE
ON PAUSE INDEFINITELY,

903
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:12,644
YOU JUST GIVE ME
THE WORD

904
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:15,037
AND I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

905
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:16,125
OH, I WILL.

906
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:18,693
AND IT WON'T BE
A LONG WAIT.

907
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:22,871
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR MY SON MARQUIS

908
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:24,873
TO TAKE HIS
LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

909
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:53,336
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
