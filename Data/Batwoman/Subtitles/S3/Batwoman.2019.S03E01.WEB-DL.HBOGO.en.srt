00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,360
<i>Last season on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,600
- New look!
- New Batwoman.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,120
- What is this place?
- It was where Bruce

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
kept the weapons he confiscated

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,840
from all the villains
he took down.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,040
When I was a kid,
I drew pictures of how I imagined

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,520
a black Batman would look.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,520
Turns out my dad was secretly

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,760
turning those pictures
into reality.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,680
Your mother didn't die
in childbirth, Ry-Ry.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,160
Mommy dearest
is still very much alive.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,960
So, what's next, Batwoman?

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,080
We're gonna find
that case of Batman's trophies

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,560
before anyone else does.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,240
<i>It didn't take long
for the psychiatric unit</i>

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,920
<i>at Gotham University Hospital</i>

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,840
<i>to make their recommendation
to the courts.</i>

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>Wonderland Gang leader Alice</i>

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>aka the missing
and presumed dead Beth Kane</i>

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,800
<i>will not stand trial but instead
will continue her residency</i>

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,480
<i>at Arkham Asylum
for the Criminally Insane.</i>

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,400
Curiouser and curiouser.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,040
I will show them exactly
how wrong they are about you.

24
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,040
And I will have so much fun
doing it.

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,640
Just as you would want,
my dear, sweet Alice.

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,480
Where were we?
Oh, yeah, side-kick names.

27
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,400
Just FYI,
no sidekick actually likes

28
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,280
to be referred to as a sidekick.

29
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,800
- Copy that, my number two dude.
- Nope. Not that either.

30
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
{\an5}"All the more reason
for me to find a way

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
{\an5}to get you out of there.

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,400
{\an5}I promise you, I'm not giving up
on you this time.

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,440
More to come.

34
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,360
Your father."

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,680
Kane.

36
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,440
Visitor.

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,520
{\an5}So I have an idea for a name.

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,720
Just please don't say
Black Batman.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,880
Seriously, Black Batman?

40
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Coming from the girl
who inherited her code name.

41
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,640
You know what, I got one.
The Dork Knight.

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,080
Just look for
the damn poison ivy.

43
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,640
{\an5}Yeah, you sure
they shipped it here?

44
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
{\an5}Believe it or not

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,560
poison ivy doesn't get
a lot of action on the dark web.

46
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,120
{\an5}So I got creative, honed in on
people who could actually benefit

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,840
{\an5}from a mystical,
fast-growing vine

48
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,400
{\an5}and found these guys
looking for a way

49
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,880
to expand their marijuana crop.

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,120
Shipment was supposed
to come in today.

51
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,000
{\an5}Of all the artifacts that fell
into the river

52
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,960
a poison ivy sprig doesn't
exactly scream money maker.

53
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,680
Bingo.

54
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,840
{\an5}Is it just me or has this
quadrupled since Circe took it?

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,320
{\an5}Someone probably just got it wet.
Keep it away from the light.

56
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
Hey. You copy?

57
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,640
What the hell was that?

58
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,720
{\an5}So, what, we're sisters now?

59
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,120
Far from it.

60
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,080
I graduate med school tomorrow.

61
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,480
{\an5}And Dad's one wish
was for me to check on you

62
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,880
{\an5}and keep you from going off
the deep-end.

63
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,520
{\an5}So this is me, pretending to care
so I don't have to lie to him

64
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,000
{\an5}when he calls me tomorrow
to congratulate me.

65
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,160
That is so sweet.

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,080
But I'm good.

67
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,240
{\an5}I can smell you
through this partition

68
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,400
so I beg to differ.

69
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,080
{\an5}See that's the thing.

70
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,560
{\an5}None of these matters.

71
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,440
{\an5}Because Daddy's going to find
a way to get me out of here.

72
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,600
{\an5}Really? From the top bunk
of his cell in Metropolis?

73
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Even incarcerated

74
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,320
{\an5}Daddy's one of the most
connected men in Gotham City.

75
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,600
What makes you believe that?

76
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,560
{\an5}Oh, he didn't tell you.

77
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,880
{\an5}Yeah, we've been writing.

78
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,000
{\an5}So I know you came to make sure
that I was miserable,

79
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,720
{\an5}but I'm sorry to inform you,
I'm not.

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Fine.

81
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,600
{\an5}Then this is me punching in
and promptly punching out.

82
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,040
See you, Alice.

83
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,640
One quick question
while I have you.

84
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,240
It's about your little pal Ryan.

85
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,000
Four down.
How many still out there?

86
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
A lot.

87
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,640
But at least in the meantime

88
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,040
we prevented Gotham
from a cortisone shortage.

89
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,080
So you wanna tell me
why you froze up back there?

90
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,480
I didn't freeze up. The suit did.
It just glitches out sometimes.

91
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
Because I can't be watching
both of our asses.

92
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,840
Yeah, I know that.
And I'll fix it.

93
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
Graduation tickets!

94
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,240
I go on at 7, which means your
butt needs to be in your seat

95
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,200
at 6:30, sharp.

96
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,920
So if there's
a bomber threatening

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
to take out half the city

98
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,560
just remember that I only become
an official MD once

99
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,560
and people bomb Gotham
every other day.

100
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,920
Now if you'll excuse me

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,520
I have to go shower off
my encounter with Alice.

102
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,000
Apparently, she and my dad
are pen pals now.

103
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,600
That's uncomfortable.

104
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,320
I've barely even heard from him
since he was put away

105
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,640
but sure,
reconnect with the chick

106
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,880
who killed your second wife.

107
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,240
I'll just be graduating tomorrow

108
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,920
you know, valedictorian,
top of my class

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,760
but as long as Alice knows
that you're thinking of her...

110
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,720
Hey, hey, hey.

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,720
I know your family
can't be there tomorrow.

112
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,360
But this family can.
And we won't miss it.

113
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, that reminds me

114
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,160
Alice told me to ask you
about your birth mom.

115
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,320
She was like,
"Ryan will know what I mean."

116
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,600
And then she smiled
like a total creep.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Your mom died in childbirth.
That's dark even for Alice.

118
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,600
So you don't know
what she's referring to?

119
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,520
Since when does Alice
ever make sense?

120
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,120
I can relate to Alice
on a deeply personal level

121
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,160
which is why I'm here
at her last known hideout

122
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,760
where society shoved her
back into the sewers.

123
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,240
At the tender age of 13,
she was lost

124
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,680
forgotten, held captive,
tortured.

125
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,480
Who wouldn't break
under all that?

126
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,960
Locking her away in Arkham

127
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,640
is just victimizing her
all over again.

128
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,240
You know you drank too much
when you're seeing leprechauns.

129
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,280
Free Alice? That woman
is a full-blown lunatic.

130
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,880
Alice is a survivor.
Pay her some respect.

131
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,200
Alice is just another victim
of a flawed bureaucratic system.

132
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,480
She deserves her day in court.

133
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,200
Dude, why did...
Why did you just say that?

134
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,760
No idea why I just said that.

135
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,800
What the hell was that?

136
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,440
What's happening
with your hat, huh?

137
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,680
Let go of me.

138
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,680
Curiouser and curiouser.

139
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,600
What the hell is going on?

140
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,720
Let's just get out of here, dude.

141
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
Stand still.

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,240
- Why can't I move?
- Kill him.

143
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,520
I'm not killing my friend, freak.

144
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,280
Dude, what are you doing?

145
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,680
No, no, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,640
Oh, my. What the hell is that?

147
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,080
What did you make me do?
You psycho!

148
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,800
You're a freaking psycho!

149
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,560
Mad as a hatter.

150
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,880
Yo! Hey, I got something for you.

151
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,560
I'm sleeping, go away.

152
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,760
I think you're gonna
wanna see this.

153
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,440
Isn't that the Batman guy?

154
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,720
The Mad Hatter? I remember him
from when I was a kid.

155
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,760
Move!

156
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,480
I swear I would
never kill anybody.

157
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,200
It was like one second

158
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,160
I'm laughing at some loser
in dress-up

159
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,440
and the next thing I know I'm
slicing open my buddy's throat.

160
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,840
It was completely
out of my control.

161
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,360
What makes you think
it was the Mad Hatter?

162
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, Montoya, last I checked
you traded that big shiny pin

163
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,120
for a basement desk
in the City Hall.

164
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,360
What's it again, The Freak Squad?

165
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,560
Rogues Unit.

166
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,880
- Was he short, old, what?
- No, younger.

167
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,040
Lanky. Dork-like.

168
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,400
He's a Mad Hatter imposter.
Which means he found the hat.

169
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,000
<i>No, no, what are you doing?</i>

170
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,200
<i>No, no, no!</i>

171
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,880
<i>Oh, my... What the hell
did you just do?</i>

172
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,480
I don't know
what's more disturbing

173
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,400
that, that he posted it

174
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,840
or that Alice
actually has a fanboy.

175
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,480
Sorry, how does a top hat

176
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,360
make someone kill
their drinking buddy?

177
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Right.

178
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,440
Meet Jervis Tetch,
aka, the original Mad Hatter.

179
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,840
Now, according to my dad

180
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,280
Jervis Tetch was a tiny, insecure
and annoying neuroscientist.

181
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,960
He felt like the world
wasn't listening to him

182
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,840
so he developed
mind-control technology

183
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,400
to force them to listen.

184
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
He built it directly
into his hat.

185
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,800
Okay, this says Bruce
had the hat deprogrammed

186
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,160
before he put it
in the trophy case.

187
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,360
My guess is that
the technology latches

188
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,720
to the brain activity of the
first person who puts it on.

189
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,520
But if the hat is technology,
can't we hack it or whatever?

190
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,720
It's not exactly uploaded
to the Cloud.

191
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
We, first, need to get the hat
off his head.

192
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,840
Well, how, without falling victim
to it in the process?

193
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
One hundred and twenty-eight
hertz of frequency.

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,320
Your dad figured out how to
disrupt the hat's radio waves.

195
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,680
Okay, so we know the how
and the what.

196
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,880
We just need to know the where.

197
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,880
So if I were an Alice-obsessed
Mad Hatter wannabe

198
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,080
where would I go?

199
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,440
I was wondering when
you'd come crawling back.

200
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,800
You stormed out of here
in such a huff last time

201
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,520
I was worried it was something
I said.

202
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Tell me what you're planning
with your Mad Hatter superfan.

203
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,520
I told you, I don't know him.

204
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,040
Well, he certainly knows
a lot about you.

205
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,720
Have you watched the news?
My identity's been outed.

206
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,280
And some people
actually appreciate

207
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,080
that I'm just a girl standing
in front of a psychiatric ward

208
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,960
asking them not to fry her brain.

209
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,480
Oh, come on.

210
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,400
We both know I'm utterly helpless
behind these walls.

211
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,520
You came because you want
all the dirty deets on mommy D.

212
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,240
I saw my birth mother's
death certificate.

213
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,680
Nia A. Wilder.
Died the day I was born.

214
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,320
If you say so, dear.

215
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,320
What is this?

216
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
Are you lonely?

217
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,960
You need to keep somebody
on a leash

218
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,520
to stop you from slipping
into total isolation?

219
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,080
Am I lonely?

220
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,920
Look at your life.

221
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,640
Your closest emotional connection
is an ex in witness protection.

222
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,920
You have no one.

223
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,080
I gave you someone to fill the
hole in your little empty heart.

224
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,600
- I have my friends.
- Luke and Mary?

225
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
Right. Who you're so close to
you can't even tell

226
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,600
your birth mother lied to you
all these years.

227
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
We're done here.

228
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,360
Sounds like your Mad Hatter's
planning a tea party.

229
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,320
Do you know what he's planning,
Alice?

230
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,240
- I just know what I would do.
- Which is?

231
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,640
It would be so refreshing

232
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,760
if a supervillain actually said
what they meant for once.

233
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,680
What tea party?

234
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Not to kill the mood,
but the last tea party Alice had

235
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,280
she poisoned your mom.

236
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,440
So what, he's making it personal?
More public?

237
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,400
You know what?
I should ask my dad

238
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,600
maybe he's chatted about it with
Alice in their correspondence.

239
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,320
Okay.

240
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,760
You, my dear, are graduating
top of your class

241
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,880
looking fine as hell,
might I add.

242
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,080
And we are standing here
talking about Alice.

243
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,440
Can we not let that bitch
ruin the best thing

244
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
we have going on right now,
please?

245
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,680
Fine. Subject change.

246
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,320
Who's this Deja girl
you ditched me for last night?

247
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,080
- I thought her name was Riley.
- Oh, no, Riley was last week.

248
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,600
Excuse me, I am allowed
to date multiple women at once.

249
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,600
So I take it you and Kate
are not happening?

250
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,360
Oh, no, they're good.

251
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,960
They're friends.

252
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,560
But it's too complicated
for anything more right now.

253
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,320
Thank you, Mary.

254
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,240
Yes, all of that.

255
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Ryan Wilder,

256
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,560
I think this is the most interest

257
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,280
you've ever shown
in my love life.

258
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,000
At least somebody's getting
some around here.

259
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,920
You know, the more I think
about this tea party thing

260
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,040
if there's one person who can
predict a lunatic's next move,

261
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,240
it's another certifiable lunatic.

262
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,720
That's what I can't shake.

263
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,120
She has no reason
to make this up.

264
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,800
She has every reason. Because
this is all a game to her.

265
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,520
She's trying to feel relevant

266
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,160
because she doesn't
matter anymore.

267
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,520
Now seriously drop it
before y'all both kill my buzz.

268
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,920
You all know this wasn't
a cheap ass bottle of champagne.

269
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,600
- I'm gonna go check on her.
- I should go practice my speech.

270
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,560
Wanna tell me what happened
at Arkham?

271
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,720
Nothing.

272
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,760
Because Alice
was unhelpful and petulant

273
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,520
and everything
one would expect Alice to be.

274
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,800
Then if she was everything
you expected,

275
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,160
how'd she get under your skin?

276
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,160
Ryan, what happened?

277
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,400
She said my biological mother,
who died giving birth to me

278
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
was actually still alive,

279
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,120
and that she covered it all up
with a fake name

280
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,560
so I'd never find her.

281
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,120
Damn.

282
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,960
And as much as I don't believe
a word Alice says...

283
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,200
There's still a part of you
that can't help but wonder

284
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,800
is my mom still alive?

285
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,920
I take it Mary and Luke
don't know.

286
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,240
I don't know if I want to know.

287
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,560
I was told my whole life that my
dad was out of the picture

288
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,360
and my mom died in the hospital.

289
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,760
What if I have a family out there?

290
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,960
Want me to look into it,
on the DL?

291
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,320
Thank you.

292
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,560
Testing one, two, three.

293
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,800
Hey, you're not supposed
to be up here.

294
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,720
I got a guy matching
the top hat looney from the news.

295
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,160
I'm just testing the microphone

296
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,080
making sure
that my voice projects

297
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,880
all the way to the back.

298
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,160
Perfect, you're all here.

299
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,000
Gather around, friends.
It's a lovely afternoon...

300
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,680
for tea.

301
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,720
<i>Gotham City Vital Records.</i>

302
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,920
Hi, I was hoping you could
e-mail me a birth certificate.

303
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,120
<i>Mail only. Four to six weeks.</i>

304
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
Okay. Thanks anyway.

305
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,560
I will just hack into your system
and find it myself.

306
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,880
Let's see.
Who was the attending physician?

307
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,560
Doctor Quadaracci.

308
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,720
Shady doctor. Here we go.

309
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,040
Mayor Hartley.

310
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,200
See this sandwich, Montoya?
I haven't eaten since 9:30.

311
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,800
The Mad Hatter's a copycat.

312
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,240
I think he somehow gotten ahold
of the original hat

313
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,360
which doesn't make sense,

314
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,640
because Batman took it off
the streets

315
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,520
and locked it down 20 years ago.

316
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Am I special or did you torture
Mayor Akins, too?

317
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,760
He hired me, ma'am.
To run the Rogues Unit.

318
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,520
I convinced him
that it's only a matter of time

319
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,680
before Batman's enemies

320
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,160
come crawling out of the sewer
looking for their toys.

321
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
And here we are.

322
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,520
And it's not just
the Mad Hatter's hat.

323
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,640
Of course, it's not.

324
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,160
Apparently
a cutting of poison ivy

325
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,680
was bouncing around the dark web
for the past three days.

326
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
If someone's leaking these back
onto the streets,

327
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,160
I need to see
what else is out there.

328
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,160
Look, I am 30 days
into this whole Mayor gig

329
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,720
and I'm not putting the words

330
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,080
"Rogues" or "Toys"
onto my budget.

331
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,000
What about the words
"mass casualty" and "preventable"

332
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,680
on your resignation letter?

333
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,960
Mayor, I love this city
in my bones.

334
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,520
And I need you to hear me

335
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,880
before this becomes Jim Gordon's
Gotham all over again.

336
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,680
It's a two drink limit,
so sip slowly.

337
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,680
Okay, what?

338
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,560
Alice was right.

339
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,240
- Nia A. Wilder doesn't exist.
- I saw her death certificate.

340
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,400
The doctor who signed
her death certificate

341
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,520
also signed
your birth certificate.

342
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,440
Two months later,
he lost his license

343
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,080
for an unrelated wire fraud,

344
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,520
so I honed in on him.

345
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,000
He had 25 patients in the days
surrounding your birth.

346
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,640
I looked into all of them.

347
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,120
And one came into the hospital
a day before you were born.

348
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,640
According to her medical file

349
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,840
she was suffering from a cyst
on her ovary.

350
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,400
So I followed the money.

351
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,080
She paid him two million dollars

352
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,560
after her "so-called"
emergency surgery.

353
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,920
Two million dollars to cover up
her pregnancy with me.

354
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,680
- Why?
- I have no idea.

355
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,640
But your mom's still alive, Ryan.

356
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,360
My dad?

357
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,240
Nothing. Just her.

358
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,760
Here. If you want to know
her name.

359
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,520
And if you don't, I get that too.

360
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,920
Two drink limit?

361
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,720
What are we talking about?

362
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,040
Let's find our seats.

363
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,040
Ready for your big speech?

364
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,840
Dr. Hall. Sorry,
I was just having a moment.

365
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,960
I'm sure your family
would be proud. They better be.

366
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,560
You're one of the best students

367
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,360
that's ever come
through this school.

368
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,760
Thank you, Dr. Hall.

369
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,120
Dr. Hamilton. You are the
spitting image of your mother.

370
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,640
"Do no harm."

371
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,200
Today we take
the Hippocratic Oath.

372
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,480
But shouldn't it be called
the Hypocrite Oath...

373
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,360
I mean,
doctors are supposed to uphold

374
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,280
the highest ethical
medical standards, right?

375
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,440
Instead it's "How many patients
can I see in a day? "

376
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,440
And, "Sorry,
we don't take that insurance,"

377
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,600
and "That bandage costs $300."

378
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,080
What happened
to the Gotham medical community?

379
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,880
- Did she change her speech?
- This is not her speech.

380
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,440
And don't even get me started
on mental health care.

381
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,200
Do you know the process
of institutionalizing someone?

382
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,160
It took our alma mater Gotham U

383
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,800
under the oversight
of our chair Dr. Hall

384
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,200
a measly 10 minutes to decide

385
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,480
that Alice would be
an Arkham lifer.

386
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,920
So what, we just give up on her?

387
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,720
This is not Mary talking.

388
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,520
He got to her. He's here.

389
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,560
What about the fact that she was
victimized for over a decade?

390
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,320
That her own family
gave up on her?

391
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,920
That she was replaced...

392
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
by me?

393
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,800
This is what Alice meant.
This is his tea party.

394
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,040
If you have earbuds, put them on.

395
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,440
I'm texting you
a disrupter frequency

396
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,640
to block his mind-control.

397
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Everybody,
shut up and take your seats

398
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,440
until I instruct you otherwise.

399
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,880
The show is about to begin.

400
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,600
Now, if you are going to wield
the power of a god,

401
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,600
prove you're worthy.

402
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,000
Remove this man's organs
one at a time until he dies.

403
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,720
- You need help.
- You sound like all my doctors.

404
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,320
- Okay, we need to take him out.
- No, no, we can't do that.

405
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,960
He's already brain-jacked
everyone here.

406
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,240
We need to get him to reverse it
before Mary kills that guy.

407
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,000
How? Ask nicely?

408
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,000
There is one person
he'll listen to.

409
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,920
- No.
- Ryan

410
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,920
Mary is about to de-organ
the chair of her university.

411
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,680
- Absolutely not.
- Okay, what am I missing?

412
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,680
We can get Liam
to undo the mind-control.

413
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,120
But we have to break Alice
out of Arkham first.

414
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,680
It may have taken him 15 years
and several dead wives

415
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,560
but Daddy finally understands
that I'm still his little girl.

416
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,960
And he's going to use every
last resource that he has left

417
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,000
to get me out of this hellhole

418
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,320
and as far away from Gotham
as possible.

419
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,840
Alice, we've been over this.

420
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,840
Your father
is incarcerated himself.

421
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,160
No one is coming to rescue you.

422
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,440
- Oh, okay, everyone, stay calm.
- Daddy?

423
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,040
- What? No.
- Alice, we're going. Let's go.

424
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,600
- Get off of me!
- I need you to come with me!

425
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,320
Help! Help! Help! Help me!

426
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,240
I see she's found the appendix.

427
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,680
Starting with the
unnecessary organs first

428
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,480
prolonging the inevitable.

429
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,400
Appendix is out.
Luke, where are you?

430
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
Headed to the roof as we speak.

431
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,000
I can't stop any of Liam's
previous commands

432
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,120
only he can do that

433
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,640
but this should protect everyone
from any of his future commands.

434
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,960
Get ready to rock.

435
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,440
What are you doing?
Put your phones away.

436
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,120
Stop! Stop!

437
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,080
Alice, I need you.

438
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,320
Mary needs you.

439
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Open!

440
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,760
My dad's going to take me away
from Gotham! From all of you!

441
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,120
- Leave me alone!
- Your dad's not coming, Alice.

442
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,640
He is! He told me. He promised.
In his postcards. He promised.

443
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,160
What? These?

444
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,040
This is an add from a magazine,
Alice. It's for soap.

445
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,440
This is a page
from the Arkham directory.

446
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,400
A napkin from the cafeteria.

447
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,960
- This is a coloring book page.
- What?

448
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,840
- Your dad is not writing to you.
- He sent me these.

449
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,120
I read them with my own eyes.

450
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,640
Your mind is
playing tricks on you.

451
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,240
Look, I get it.
You lost Ocean, your dad, Kate.

452
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,280
Now you're back in here,
it's too much.

453
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
He's coming.
Because he promised me. He's coming!

454
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,120
It's garbage! Alice!

455
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,120
Help us.

456
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,320
If you help us

457
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,680
you can run.

458
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,480
And I won't stop you.

459
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,440
I'm sure that was a lot.
You wanna talk about it?

460
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,600
There's no point.

461
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,560
Did you just say something?

462
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Alice?

463
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Alice, did you say something?

464
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,520
Well, I can't exactly meet my
future boyfriend in this, can I?

465
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,760
Mary.

466
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,640
I'm here. What do we do?
How do we save him?

467
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,120
We can't.

468
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,160
I took his appendix,
his gallbladder

469
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,400
a kidney, his spleen.

470
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,480
I'm down to vitals.

471
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,240
I have to keep removing
his organs until he dies.

472
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,160
- Then kill him.
- What?

473
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,880
Kill him. He's got no chance
if you remove anything else.

474
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,600
We shock his heart. He goes
into cardiac arrest and dies

475
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,240
just like the Mad Hatter guy
wanted.

476
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,520
- It'll break his mind-control.
- And then what?

477
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,840
Then we pray like hell you can
bring Dr. Hall back to life.

478
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,520
Graduates wearing
those pretentious stethoscopes.

479
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,600
Make them useful.
Tie them around your throats.

480
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,360
- What the hell happened?
- The damn suit fritzed out again.

481
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,080
Okay. No pulse. He's dead.
How do you feel?

482
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,760
Like I have my brain back.

483
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,040
It worked. It broke his control.

484
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,760
Good. Hopefully this does, too.

485
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,880
Charge.

486
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,480
Clear.

487
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,320
Charge.

488
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,640
Clear.

489
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,080
Such wasted potential.

490
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,680
The old strangle yourself
to death gag. It's classic.

491
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,280
You're supposed to be in Arkham.

492
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
Well, I had to meet
my number one fan.

493
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,360
What did I miss?

494
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Do you remember when you forced
Catherine Hamilton

495
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,360
to reveal
what a garbage human she is

496
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,640
in front of all her peers?

497
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,280
I just did the same thing
to her daughter.

498
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,120
Clever boy.

499
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,480
It's true. Doctors are all the same.

500
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,520
They think they're gods amongst men.

501
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,240
Why should I be institutionalized?

502
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,880
Because you think I'm crazy?

503
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,560
Because I see the world
a little differently than you?

504
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,240
Sorry for being my own person.

505
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,360
I heard you filmed yourself
throwing a kitten off a rooftop.

506
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,800
- You heard about that?
- Yeah.

507
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,840
Did you see it?
Five thousand seventy views.

508
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,880
Tell all these people to stop.

509
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Alice...

510
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,520
They have too much power.

511
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,600
Think about it, all they have to do
is sign a piece of paper

512
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,000
and surprise, you're bankrupt.

513
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,800
Surprise, you're addicted
to medication.

514
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,720
Surprise, you're labeled crazy.
Forever. And ever.

515
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,680
I am not crazy, Alice.

516
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,640
If any of these people die,

517
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,000
they will have a reason
to lock you away forever.

518
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
Do you think I'm crazy?

519
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,080
The truth.

520
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
No.

521
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,560
I don't think you're crazy.

522
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
If it wasn't for you,

523
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
guys like me wouldn't have heroes.

524
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,480
Stop killing yourselves.
Get out of here.

525
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,480
There.

526
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,440
Did that earn me a hug?

527
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,920
Yeah.

528
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,080
Frequency jammers.

529
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,440
You are as crazy as they come, dear.

530
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,800
Word of advice,
don't ever meet your heroes.

531
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,520
Oh, you really are the monster
they say you are.

532
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,920
That's me.

533
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,280
What the hell are you?

534
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,280
I didn't kill him. He is fine.

535
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,880
You didn't think I was actually
going to let you go.

536
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,560
You two-faced bitch.

537
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,560
I saved all those people.

538
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,000
- For you.
- No, for you.

539
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,560
Because in that warped mind,
you somehow thought today

540
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,040
would undo the hundreds
of horrific things you've done.

541
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,880
Please, this is about payback.

542
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,600
Because you can't handle the truth.

543
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,760
Don't hate me because your family
might be more screwed up than mine.

544
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,920
Get her out of here!

545
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,040
In conclusion, my fellow graduates

546
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,480
I challenge each and every one of you

547
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,800
to wake up every morning
and ask yourself,

548
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,200
"How can I end this day better
than how it started?"

549
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,000
With one more saved life,

550
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,120
one more cancer-free scan,
one more smile.

551
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,480
Because if we can do that every day

552
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,640
together we can leave this world
a better place than how we found it.

553
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,840
A happy ending to the worst
commencement ceremony in history.

554
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,360
Thanks. Look, today was awful

555
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,200
and Liam is obviously sick

556
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,160
but he did make some good points
about the medical community.

557
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,040
Like for one,

558
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,160
maybe we should stop referring
to troubled people

559
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,640
as crazy lunatics.

560
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,200
- Even Alice?
- Yeah. Even Alice.

561
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,880
Then I get to say something.

562
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,400
Toast time.

563
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,320
Mary, you have probably saved
more people than anyone in this city.

564
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,840
You are the person
that I go to for advice

565
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,480
for a shoulder to cry on

566
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,000
for, let's face it, pain meds.

567
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,440
You didn't need an MD

568
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,880
for the people who love you
to know that you are a true hero.

569
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
And it's really dope
we get to call you Dr. Hamilton.

570
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,760
Congrats, roomie.
We are so proud of you.

571
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
- We love you, Mary.
- Cheers.

572
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,480
Okay, not to bail early

573
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,920
but I need to figure out
why my suit is crashing

574
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,200
or Ryan will never let me be
her wingman again, so...

575
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,240
Wait a minute.

576
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,360
Wingman.

577
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,360
Bat wing. Batwing.

578
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,720
Oh, that's good.

579
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,680
I'll take that under consideration.
Good night.

580
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,240
Actually, can I show you something
downstairs?

581
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,440
Yeah, sure.

582
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,680
Okay, okay, cool. I'll just be...

583
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,560
I'll keep the champagne cold.

584
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,960
Mary, Luke, the Bat.
That's my family.

585
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,200
I finally have everything I want.

586
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,680
Why risk losing it
just to get to know a woman

587
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,480
who had no desire to know me?

588
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,800
My opinion?
Because she's still your mom.

589
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,080
My whole life I wanted a family.
I wanted answers.

590
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,560
I wanted to belong to someone
and for someone to belong to me.

591
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,520
But that look on Liam's face today

592
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,280
when Alice wasn't
who he needed her to be

593
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,360
it's not worth it.

594
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
I'm good.

595
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,760
Then consider it out of your life.

596
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,400
Dubai loved it.

597
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,680
Have the lawyers write up a contract

598
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,480
and get them a prototype
they can play with.

599
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,600
Ma'am.

600
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,560
Tell me you're not bringing me drama
before I've had my red wine.

601
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,320
Just got word of a security breach.

602
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,520
Then have the cyber team
do their thing,

603
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,760
why are you bothering me with this?

604
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,520
Because I don't think you want
the cyber team looking into it.

605
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,080
Somebody's been fishing
for very specific data.

606
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,800
Not on the company. On you, ma'am.

607
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,240
<i>Lucas Fox.</i>

608
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,960
<i>If you're hearing this message,
it means you found the suit.</i>

609
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,760
Dad?

610
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,560
Dad, how am I hearing your voice
right now?

611
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,440
<i>Because I'm your dad.
And I always know when you need me.</i>

612
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,160
I have never seen you before.
You a cop?

613
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,600
Fortunately for you, no.

614
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,440
How do you have this list?

615
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,360
Over a dozen weapons
of mass destruction

616
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,360
are belly up
in the Gotham River somewhere

617
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,640
and your main concern is how I know?

618
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
I'm cleaning it up.

619
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,480
I'm sure that warms
the parents of the kid

620
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,720
whose buddy slit open his throat
the other night.

621
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,800
- Where'd you get this list?
- From me.

622
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,640
In exchange for my freedom.

623
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,960
I don't know who you are,

624
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,200
but teaming up with Gotham's
most prolific criminal

625
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,440
is going to blow up in your face.

626
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,760
It worked out well for you today.

627
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,920
You and Alice stopped a madman.
And he's just the beginning.

628
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,200
Why did you call me here?

629
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,920
You're strong and you have access.

630
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,440
She's got the mind of a psychopath.

631
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,360
So together, you two are gonna find

632
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,000
and stop every freak
who gets his hands

633
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,440
on one of these weapons
until each of the items on that list

634
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,000
are found and accounted for.

635
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,040
Hard pass.

636
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,720
It's just as easy for me to shut down
your illegal vigilante operation...

637
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,840
Ryan Wilder.

638
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Well...

639
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,640
all that time my boyfriend,
father, sister

640
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,520
spent trying to break through
to my good side...

641
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,160
Silly them. It's so much more fun
on my bad side.

642
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,680
So do we have a deal or what?

643
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,840
Oh, yes, I for one am in. Yeah.

644
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,080
Batwoman? Answer the question.

645
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,880
You in

646
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,960
or you hanging up the cape?

647
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,520
Sounds like I don't have a choice.
