1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,640
Any other dormice
want to come out to play?

2
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,880
Hello, little friend.

3
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,240
Oh, my God.

4
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,640
You're Alice.

5
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,880
Correction.

6
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,920
I was Alice.

7
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,640
What is happening?

8
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,560
Oh, my God.

9
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,480
You're awake.

10
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,240
How am I here?

11
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,720
The Bat Team got wind
of your break-in.

12
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,440
Found you unconscious
underneath Marquis's pool table.

13
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,600
Beat the GCPD by a few seconds
and dumped you here.

14
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,840
You were...
You were out for a few hours.

15
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,920
I didn't know that you'd wake up.

16
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,760
Oh, Alice, are you okay?

17
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,920
Alice?

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,840
How do you feel?

19
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,320
I feel like Beth again.

20
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,880
We've gathered this morning
to discuss

21
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,560
the psychological evaluation
of Elizabeth Marie Kane.

22
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,560
{\an5}This is the case
of a 13-year-old child

23
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,280
{\an5}who after witnessing the grisly
decapitation of her mother

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,440
was abducted

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,600
and held against her will
by a madman.

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,000
After enduring 11 years

27
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,480
{\an5}of his psychological
and physical torture

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,120
{\an5}Beth escaped where she eventually
encountered a corrupt hypnotist

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,800
who compelled her
to fully break from her humanity.

30
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,040
As a result

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,320
{\an5}Ms. Kane disassociated from reality
to become a character named Alice.

32
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,080
Well, when you put it like that...

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
For the past three weeks

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
the Gotham City
Psychological Association...

35
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,800
Is it just me or did they make Alice
sound like a victim?

36
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm listening.

37
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,640
Our findings indicate
that after exposure

38
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,800
to a single electrical charge

39
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,600
{\an5}Ms. Kane's brain
essentially rewired itself.

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,840
The area that had been cut off
from love and empathy

41
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,360
{\an5}has been restored.

42
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,840
It is our recommendation to the court

43
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,440
that the criminal charges are dropped
and Ms. Kane be relieved of her trial

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,320
as we can no longer deem her
clinically insane.

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,320
Ms. Kane, where did you get
this magical buzzer?

46
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Ryan. Ryan, I'm sorry.

47
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,320
Apologies.

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,280
You knew I needed that buzzer
for Marquis.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,480
You knew I needed it for me.

50
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,280
{\an5}The court of public opinion
may have changed their mind about you

51
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,000
{\an5}but that doesn't change the truth.

52
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,920
Take it.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,760
Maybe Luke can figure out a way
to make it work again.

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,440
{\an5}It's fried, Alice. It's dead.

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,160
You won.

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,760
{\an5}Ms. Kane,
how are you feeling about today?

57
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,240
Ms. Kane, what's next for you?

58
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,840
As much as I'd convinced myself
you were dead...

59
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,520
you were always there.

60
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
You just needed to be found.

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
{\an5}I've always been a sucker
for a happy ending.

62
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,320
Ocean?

63
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,400
{\an5}How are you...

64
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,200
{\an5}You can't be here.

65
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,360
{\an5}You mean because I'm dead?

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,080
Because of you?

67
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,520
That's the thing, Alice.

68
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,920
{\an5}I don't think
you deserve a happy ending.

69
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,280
No, no, no.

70
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
What... What are you doing?

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,440
No. I'm sorry.

72
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,920
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,920
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,840
{\an5}It wasn't my fault.

75
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,480
I swear.

76
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,400
{\an5}What is happening to me?

77
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,760
No...

78
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,440
{\an5}Where is it?

79
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,920
{\an5}Leave me alone!

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,080
{\an5}Leave me alone!
Get away from me, Alice!

81
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
Get away!

82
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
What the...

83
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,840
Holy crap. You're Batwoman.

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,600
And you're Marquis Jet's
loyal number two.

85
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,760
In every morning before sunrise.

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
Never takes a sick day.

87
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Keeper of Marquis's schedule
and, shall I presume, his secrets?

88
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Hey.

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So if you leave me alone in bed

90
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,320
you better have coffee.

91
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,480
Cream and sugar, dear?

92
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,280
Alice?

93
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,480
What are you doing here?
I have patients coming in.

94
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,480
Alice!

95
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,640
Where's the haloperidol?
The chlorpromazine?

96
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,800
The antipsychotics, Mar-Bear.
Cough them up.

97
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,800
I thought you were leaving.

98
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,800
I packed you a bag.

99
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,760
I gave you enough cash
to get halfway across this country.

100
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,200
Alice, there's an APB on your head.
You can't be here!

101
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,640
I am losing my mind!

102
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,360
I'm... I'm losing my mind.

103
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,480
The... The hallucinations are back,
but worse, I...

104
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,600
I just need a little edger
until you get me the Joy Buzzer.

105
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,880
But Kiki, she said that
there's only one buzz left.

106
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,880
Exactly,
so why are we still standing here?

107
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,240
Because Ryan needs it
for her brother.

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,640
But you need it for your sister.

109
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,920
Except you're not my sister.

110
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,480
Why didn't you stop me?

111
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,560
A real sister would've stopped me
before I killed someone!

112
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,640
You think this is my fault?

113
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,080
That was all you.

114
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,520
Poison Mary.

115
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,000
I was there for you,
making sure no one got in your way.

116
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,400
You weren't there for me,
you took advantage of me.

117
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,880
You needed me,
so you encouraged me.

118
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,280
And... and now a wife
is without her husband

119
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,120
and there are two boys
without their dad

120
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,880
and their life is ruined
and my life is ruined!

121
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,920
Got it.

122
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,400
I am so sorry that you gutted a man
with a tree branch.

123
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
My bad!

124
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,880
Would you just get the hell
out of here?

125
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,680
What is this, Gilmore Girls?

126
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,000
Ryan and I have some family matters
to discuss.

127
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,040
You mean you need her protection
from Marquis.

128
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,840
Now that the evidence of him
killing his father has been destroyed

129
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,800
you don't have anything
to hold over his head.

130
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,680
Ryan's life is complicated enough

131
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,280
without you playing Mom
all of a sudden.

132
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,320
The only one who's playing here
is Marquis

133
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,440
and if we don't get our hands
on that Joy Buzzer

134
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,960
and use it on him soon

135
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,600
all of Gotham City
could become his sandbox.

136
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,200
You know, maybe if you had
treated him like a criminal

137
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,720
and not your precious baby boy

138
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,440
we wouldn't be in this situation
to begin with.

139
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,000
- Maybe we wouldn't be...
- Do you really think...

140
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,320
Tell me
that is not vegan puff pastry.

141
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,840
Hey, you could've warned me
your mom was coming over.

142
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
At least when I lived with Alice,
she knocked.

143
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
Your mama almost saw me naked.

144
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,760
I am sorry. I...

145
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,160
I should've said something.

146
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,080
She wanted to huddle so we can
game-plan a way to stop Marquis.

147
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,480
- What's all this?
- This is Marquis's calendar.

148
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,920
Step one, we get a sense of his day,
so step two, we can ambush his ass.

149
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,360
- What's wrong?
- There's nothing on his schedule.

150
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,120
Yeah, but look at tomorrow
and every day last week.

151
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,840
He's booked solid 9 to 6,
meetings, lunches, calls, drinks.

152
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,280
Is there something special
about today?

153
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,600
Not that I know of.

154
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,600
Wait.

155
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,960
- Who's Barbara Kean?
- Why?

156
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,960
He emailed Miles,
asking him to find her home address.

157
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,400
Okay, Barbara Kean is the owner
of an art gallery in the Bowery

158
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,200
and Jim Gordon's ex-wife.

159
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,360
As in Commissioner Gordon?

160
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,240
Yeah, apparently, they used to dine
with Gotham's upper crust

161
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,200
but divorced after their son JJ was
found with body parts in his closet.

162
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,960
Barbara's reputation never recovered.

163
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,520
Probably for the best.

164
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,640
I'm actually late for my 8.00,
so I'll get going.

165
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,760
Wait, what happened
to finding Marquis?

166
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,400
Well, I will keep an ear
to the ground

167
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
and you'll do the same.

168
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,920
And whatever you need...

169
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,640
resources, money, manpower,
you got it, it's yours.

170
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,560
That was weird, right?

171
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,480
What?

172
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,920
Stay here.

173
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,160
- Where you going?
- Just give me two minutes.

174
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,560
I don't know how he knows
or what he's doing

175
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,960
but if it involves Barbara

176
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,640
it could very well involve you,
me, Mario, all of us.

177
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,000
Let your security teams know
we're not safe.

178
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,120
From whom?

179
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,720
BGS?

180
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,960
How'd you get down here so fast?

181
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,360
It's a lesbian bar. Know your exits.

182
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,600
Why didn't you tell Ryan

183
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
that Barbara Kean is part
of the Black Glove Society?

184
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,520
This doesn't need to involve Ryan.

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,920
Worried her knowing you're still
affiliated with a murderous cabal

186
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
might screw up
mother-daughter bonding time?

187
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,920
Despite appearances, Sophie,
I'm trying to do what's right.

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,240
Now excuse me
before people get hurt.

189
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,040
Ryan wants to trust you.
You're not even giving her a chance.

190
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,040
If you care about Ryan,
you'll keep this to yourself.

191
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,320
Hi. Can I ask who you're here
to pick up?

192
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,440
Who are you?

193
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,120
Is it Jada Jet?

194
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,240
Why are you asking me that?

195
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,480
Call 911.
Your boss was just kidnapped.

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
Oh, my God.

197
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,200
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

198
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,080
Is your mom home?

199
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,200
Mom, door!

200
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,760
Noah, you're gonna wake up
your little brother.

201
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,560
Sorry, if you're here to sell
something, it's not a good time.

202
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,920
Oh, no, I'm not selling anything.

203
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,320
I'm Mary Hamilton.

204
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,160
I'm sorry to stop by unannounced

205
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,600
when your family is going through
such a difficult time.

206
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Yes?

207
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,360
I believe I have information
pertaining to your husband's death.

208
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Come in.

209
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,600
Look who's losing her grip.

210
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Figuratively and literally.

211
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,400
My sweet Mouse.

212
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
No.

213
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,440
Did you think this was over?

214
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,240
I am not listening to you.

215
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,440
You're not here, and you're not real.

216
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,440
What are you doing here?

217
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,160
Trying to get yourself
a little Joy Buzzer?

218
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,600
An undo switch?

219
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,840
Wouldn't that be nice?

220
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,560
Get out of my head...

221
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,760
You didn't really think
you've seen the last of me, did you?

222
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,120
Okay.

223
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,000
The good news is black Rolls-Royce
with cranberry leather interior

224
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,840
are rare even for rich people.

225
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,640
This was targeted.

226
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,440
I mean, how else would someone know

227
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,440
the identical make and model
of Jada's car?

228
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,320
Speaking of identical,
weren't you wearing that yesterday?

229
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
Actually, I...

230
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,680
Helped me track down
Marquis' assistant all night.

231
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,040
She didn't have time to go home.

232
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,960
Okay. Got a hit.

233
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,840
Partial plate belongs to a car
purchased two days ago

234
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,080
by Wayne Enterprises.

235
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,880
Marquis. He made his move.

236
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,880
Call me crazy
but I think this has something to do

237
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,400
with Barbara Kean
and the Black Glove Society.

238
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,840
Explain to me on the road.

239
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,880
Luke, give me a trace on that car.

240
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,320
We need to know where the hell
he's taking her ASAP.

241
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,520
On it.

242
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,320
Make me a Joy Buzzer

243
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,000
and this could be an exciting tale
to tell the grandkids

244
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
around the campfire.

245
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,640
Nice try

246
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,400
but nothing beats the one
about the time

247
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,600
I helped the Joker
beat Robin to death with a crowbar.

248
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,720
Holiday family classic.

249
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,120
See, the thing is, sweetie...

250
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,480
I only have the patience
to work for one psychopath

251
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,920
and unfortunately for you,
Marquis Jet signs my W2s.

252
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,840
A little tip
about managing psychopaths.

253
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,920
It's best to appease the one
who has the knife at your throat.

254
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,800
I've worked for the Joker
since I was 16.

255
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,320
You think you're the first
crazy blonde woman

256
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,800
I've ever dealt with?

257
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,560
Sorry about that.

258
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,360
Way too many crazy people
in this room.

259
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,400
Of course, it's in her pocket.

260
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,600
She was making
some last-minute tweaks for me.

261
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,800
Alice of freaking Wonderland.

262
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,760
May I just say, it is an honor.

263
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,720
Marquis Jet, I presume.

264
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,880
In the flesh. Don't steal it.

265
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,400
So, Alice of freaking Wonderland,
what could you possibly want

266
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,640
with my Joy Buzzer?

267
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,080
Here's the thing. That's...

268
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,560
That's one more buzz in it.

269
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,560
And if you play
your razor-sharp cards right

270
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,760
it doesn't have to be used on you.

271
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,680
Pretty please, tell me you didn't
wanna use it on yourself.

272
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,000
I mean, you're a legend.

273
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,040
You're the Menace of Gotham.

274
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,680
The Ring Leader of Rabbits.

275
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,440
The Queen of Heartlessness.

276
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,040
Like you said, too many crazies,
too small a space.

277
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,160
Now give me...

278
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,520
The thing is, Alice...

279
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,240
you know, I might be new to this
whole world of public psychos

280
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,520
but I'm not about to start my reign
by losing one of the legends.

281
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
Let's see
if I can't change your mind.

282
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,840
What in the cult from hell?

283
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,440
Ladies and gentlemen
of the Black Glove Society

284
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,440
thank you for joining me
this evening.

285
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Now in honor of tradition,
let us commence with roll call.

286
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
Barbara Kean?

287
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Here.

288
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,920
Then we have Burton Crowne.

289
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,200
Nice stache, bro.

290
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,320
Next.

291
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,800
One of the biggest profiteers
of crazy...

292
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,120
Mr. Jeremiah Arkham himself.

293
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,440
Mario Falcone, welcome.

294
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,480
And last but certainly not least

295
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,840
the lady who was responsible
for this fine evening.

296
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,840
Ms. Jada Jet.

297
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,880
Now allow me to welcome you

298
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,760
to the Black Glove Society's
final ceremony.

299
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,880
Go on, look around.

300
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,680
The person to your right
and the person to your left

301
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,920
are going to die tonight.

302
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,240
We having fun yet?

303
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
So as I've recently come to discover

304
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,080
the Black Glove Society
was founded by Marla Elliot in 1984.

305
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,720
Her son Tommy
had this deeply creepy need

306
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,560
to be just like
his bestie Bruce Wayne.

307
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,680
Even wanted to be an orphan
like Bruce.

308
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,520
Which meant he went at Mommy
with her sewing scissors.

309
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,080
"Uh-oh!" said Marla Elliot...

310
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,640
hiding her stab wounds
behind her plastic surgery.

311
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,040
"I'm Gotham's high society.

312
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,680
I can't have a freak show for a son.

313
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,640
What if somebody stops inviting me
to lunches at the polo club?

314
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,040
Guess we got to do something
about that, right?"

315
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,360
And thus...

316
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,800
the Black Glove Society was born.

317
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,360
Am I getting this right so far?

318
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,760
Nod if I'm close.

319
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,800
- Yeah.
- Good.

320
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,120
Barbara Kean.

321
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,880
Now you're the mother
of JJ Gordon, right?

322
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,760
If I'm remembering this correctly,
when JJ was 15

323
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,360
he tied a labradoodle
to train tracks?

324
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,520
That's... That's rough, you know?

325
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,920
Because what happens
when you run for philanthropic chair

326
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,720
and somebody's like...

327
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,760
"Hey, didn't your kid murder
a freaking labradoodle?"

328
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,800
So to hide an unsightly scene,
you hired some off-the-books doctors

329
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,360
to fill JJ
with experimental medication

330
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,280
so you could try to fix him.

331
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,320
Problem is, shocker, it didn't work.

332
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,160
Now he's just a drooling husk
in Arkham.

333
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,840
Jada, what the hell is happening?

334
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,200
You... You need to do something.

335
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,440
- Oh, come on.
- Please.

336
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
Don't fight it, Babs.

337
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,760
I mean, you did use this
on your own son.

338
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,200
So how dangerous could it be, right?

339
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,360
Seven clinical trials in all.

340
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,880
This dose contains
every single ingredient

341
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,320
of every single medicine
you've given him.

342
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,520
I'm sorry.

343
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,440
Say hi to Marla for us, would you?

344
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,520
Who's next?

345
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,040
You know, I bet he would let you
kill a few of them.

346
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,320
- Mario Falcone.
- He seems to really like you.

347
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,040
I'm good. Thanks.

348
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,400
You sure?

349
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,160
Isn't this sort of thing
kind of like your Super Bowl?

350
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,800
Revenge. Flair.

351
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,360
A fun little wheel to make it a game.

352
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,160
Why are you here?

353
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,600
The Joy Buzzer, Alice.

354
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,080
You don't deserve that.

355
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,040
Plain and simple.

356
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,440
See, that's confusing.

357
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,080
Because you are a figment
of my delirium

358
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,680
and I know in my bones

359
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,600
that I not only deserve it,
I need it.

360
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,640
So be gone, sweet Mouse.

361
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,000
Your logic doesn't fit
into my working narrative.

362
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,360
You poisoned me...

363
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,080
at our tea party.

364
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,320
You taped a live rat to my chest

365
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,120
to lure bats to my flesh...

366
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,480
my blood.

367
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,960
That's what you did

368
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,640
to your best friend.

369
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,200
Do you think you could just
walk away from that?

370
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,960
Erase it? Move on?

371
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,160
Get away from me!

372
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,120
So you said you had information
about my husband's murder?

373
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,360
Right.

374
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,040
So...

375
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,120
This is difficult.

376
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
But...

377
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,640
I know your husband's killer.

378
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
- So do we.
- You do?

379
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,760
It's very brave of you, Mary,
to come here

380
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,160
considering your stepsister
took his life.

381
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,160
I'm sorry, what?

382
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,720
I figured that's why you came here.

383
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Yesterday, the police informed us

384
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,240
they received a call from a woman
claiming to be Alice.

385
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,120
She owned up to the murder.

386
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,400
They're still confirming
all the facts

387
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,000
but it adds up.

388
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,680
She knew the exact location,
the cause.

389
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,440
And the description matches
what my youngest told us.

390
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,360
That he saw a woman with blonde hair
attack my husband.

391
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,400
I... I assume
that's what you were here to tell us?

392
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,920
Yes.

393
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,200
That.

394
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,880
I'm so sorry.

395
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm sorry.
For how I responded with Luke.

396
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,960
I froze.

397
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,840
Not a big deal.

398
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,480
Maybe a little bit of a deal though.

399
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,840
I'm not saying we need to shout
anything from rooftops

400
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,240
but you have to admit
there's a difference

401
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,880
between keeping something private
and hiding something.

402
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,640
I wasn't hiding anything.
It was none of his business.

403
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,240
<i>Batwing to Batmobile.</i>

404
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,000
Batwing, we're here. Status update?

405
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,280
<i>Had a match on our car.</i>

406
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,840
<i>It's parked on the edge of a cemetery
on the other side of Gotham U.</i>

407
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,040
<i>Just sent you the coordinates.</i>

408
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Okay, thanks.

409
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,440
I wonder who we got next.

410
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,400
Marquis. Marquis. Stop.

411
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Does that look familiar?

412
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,480
Just...

413
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,880
You... You don't have
to do this, son.

414
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,440
I'm gonna freeze you
like you tried to freeze me, Mom.

415
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,920
It's gonna be just like
you always used to say.

416
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,520
Go stand in a corner
and think about what you've done.

417
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,560
You're gonna have decades
to do exactly that.

418
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,840
Except they're not gonna be
pleasant thoughts.

419
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,120
They're gonna be
the thoughts of a woman

420
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,200
who is more like her crazy son
than she'd ever like to admit.

421
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Marquis...

422
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,240
- Welcome to the club, Jada Jet.
- Marquis. Marquis, don't.

423
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,840
- We're all mad here.
- Don't.

424
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,400
Damn. I throw you a party,
and this is how you thank me?

425
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,200
Give it to me.

426
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,080
Or, or...

427
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,040
we rule Gotham together.

428
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,600
You could be the Harley to my Joker.

429
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,480
I think you have that backwards.

430
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,600
Besides, we come from
different schools of loony tune.

431
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,600
Is that what you really think?

432
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,080
You have no idea, do you?

433
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,000
2003.

434
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,440
My second grade class
was on a field trip.

435
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,640
And all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
someone bangs on the door

436
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,400
and lo and behold,
it's the freaking Joker.

437
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,520
He blows the bus driver's head off.

438
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,000
Now I realized nobody
was gonna do anything to help.

439
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,080
So I thought, you know,
maybe it should be me.

440
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,840
So I walked up to him, terrified,
but acting all brave.

441
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,400
And he looks down at me
with his deformed smile

442
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,440
and then he just starts
laughing and laughing.

443
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,080
Then the Joker leans in,
and he says...

444
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,600
"I'm taking you kids to
Amusement Mile

445
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,400
where I'm hiding the biggest
acid bomb you've ever seen.

446
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,800
And Gotham City
is gonna rain chemicals

447
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,800
until everybody looks like the Joker."

448
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,080
Next thing I know...

449
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,440
somebody yells
that Batman's following us.

450
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,040
And there was this...

451
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,040
there was this car in front of us
driving hella slow.

452
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,320
I just heard the Joker
revving his engine.

453
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,320
You were on the bus that drove
my mom's car off the bridge.

454
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,520
Alice,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

455
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,920
It's fate.

456
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,280
You and I were born on the same day.

457
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,240
You hear that, Mom?

458
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,880
I guess that means
today is your birthday.

459
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,400
Buckle up.

460
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,720
What if I were to give you something
that would make the Joker

461
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,480
wish he were you?

462
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,040
That's not yours.

463
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,280
Thank God.

464
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,400
- Where is he?
- I don't know. He just left.

465
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,440
You should've told me
about Black Glove.

466
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,680
I could've helped.

467
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,840
And risk losing you all over again?

468
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,720
You need to get out of here now.

469
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,680
- I'm not leaving you with him.
- Go.

470
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,400
Give me the buzzer, Alice.

471
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,040
Why are you here?

472
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,960
We need it for Marquis.

473
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,360
Says who? Jada?

474
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,560
The woman who turned your sister
into Olaf?

475
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,240
I'm not doing it for Jada.

476
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,440
I'm doing it to stop Marquis
from wreaking hell across this city.

477
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,520
Well, if it's hell that you want...

478
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,520
you've come to the right girl.

479
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,720
I'm sorry, I know you said
to never touch your gun

480
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,920
but it's so alluring.

481
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,000
That is so unfair.

482
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,560
What are you doing? Let go of me!

483
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,600
No. No, no, no. No.

484
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,040
That's mine!

485
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,320
He didn't...

486
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,200
Just help me, please.

487
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,640
Don't make me go back there.

488
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,560
Don't make me go back to Arkham.

489
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,160
Barbara? Barbara Kean. Wake up.

490
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,920
I'm gonna get you help, okay?
Just stay with me.

491
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,200
- I don't wanna hurt you.
- Hurt me?

492
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,440
But you wore a super suit here
because it's cute?

493
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,240
Look at you,
just a coward hiding her face.

494
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,160
Otherwise, everyone'll know
she's just a punk-ass street rat

495
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,920
whose own mommy didn't want her.

496
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,440
- That better?
- Oh, look at you, tough girl.

497
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,680
I'm not competing with you, Marquis.

498
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Oh, is this the part
where you tell me it's not my fault?

499
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,880
That I'm a victim,
that you feel sorry for me?

500
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,400
I don't feel sorry for you.

501
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,120
When I first learned about you,
I was jealous of you.

502
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,840
You had everything.
Security, love, family, a future.

503
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,880
Oh, yeah, my brain was scrambled eggs

504
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,440
but hey, Disneyland FastPass,
am I right?

505
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,720
You grew up believing
you could be anyone

506
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,040
that you could do anything.

507
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,840
I was jealous I didn't get that.

508
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,920
Till I realized
I had something you didn't have.

509
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,560
- Hope.
- I have hope.

510
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,800
I got hope coming out of my ears,
Wilder.

511
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,040
For example.

512
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,560
I was hoping that didn't kill you.

513
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,120
So I can freeze your ass
alongside Mom.

514
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,280
That's enough.

515
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
Don't make me do this, Marquis.

516
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,400
What are you gonna do?
Shoot your own son?

517
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,680
You're not my son.

518
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,160
Not anymore.

519
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,440
Thought I told you to run.

520
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,080
Nice try, baby girl...

521
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,720
but I'm not making
that mistake again.

522
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,280
So I've never been in an "out"
relationship with a girl.

523
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,840
Okay.

524
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,520
So we're doing this.

525
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,760
Just hear me out.

526
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,960
I've never introduced a girl
to my friends

527
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,360
or had to get Jordan's approval

528
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,800
or, God help us all,
had a girl meet my mom.

529
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,400
So that's what today triggered
for me.

530
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,080
What if I finally find the courage
to be out

531
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,920
but the person I'm interested in
doesn't want the same thing?

532
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,400
One, I'm pretty sure Jordan loves me.

533
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
And two...

534
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,280
you're right.

535
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,720
I was hiding.

536
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,680
Not from Luke, from myself.

537
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,200
Because every time
I get something good

538
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,440
I end up losing it.

539
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
Well, that's not gonna
happen this time.

540
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,800
You're gonna make me
meet your mom, aren't you?

541
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,560
Do I need to remind you what happened
the night I met your mom?

542
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,880
You owe me big time.

543
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,120
Okay.

544
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,240
Can I wear the Batsuit at least?

545
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,120
I'm the one she's gonna
try to kill, not you.

546
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,120
She's gonna be trying to tell me
that do all this other stuff that...

547
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,320
Well, Marquis ditched the Rolls.

548
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,640
So we lost eyes on him.

549
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,040
Knowing him, he won't stay
off the radar very long.

550
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,040
So we call the police, smoke him out
before he makes his next move?

551
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,600
I'm not letting him rot in Arkham
for the rest of his life.

552
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,400
Look, we have the buzzer.

553
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,160
Alice can't take it from us.

554
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
Give me 24 hours.

555
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,480
If I can't stop Marquis, then fine,
take it out of my hand.

556
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,360
But I deserve one shot.

557
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,320
Sorry, weren't you wearing that
yesterday?

558
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,040
Oh, my God, you too?

559
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,280
What is with the fashion police
today?

560
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,800
Are... Are you two...

561
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,640
Wait. No.

562
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,240
Hang on.

563
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,120
Wait.

564
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,480
No... My God. You are, aren't you?

565
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,480
Sorry, what is happening?

566
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,960
Ryan and Sophie are totally a thing.

567
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,520
Seriously?

568
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,760
Yeah.

569
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,640
We're officially a thing.

570
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,640
This is...

571
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,880
Okay. Yay!

572
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,800
I actually can't remember
the last time I heard good news

573
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
so...

574
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Are you okay right now?

575
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,280
Why are we still here?
We're leaving. Okay?

576
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,480
So you two can have
the whole place to yourselves

577
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,280
to be all cute and coupley.

578
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,520
Oh, my God.

579
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,080
How did I not know?

580
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,240
Okay. Come on.

581
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,560
You figured it out yet?

582
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,480
We're never gonna leave you.

583
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,840
Should have buzzed yourself
when you had the chance, Alice.

584
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,800
You're the one who stopped me?

585
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,800
Exactly.

586
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,280
So that every second of every day

587
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,880
we can be here to remind you
what you did to us.

588
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,600
Please go away.

589
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,200
Just go away!

590
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,840
I said get away from me!

591
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,200
Are you real?

592
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,920
Yes. Yes, Alice, I'm real.

593
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,920
Yeah, I told the facility that
I was your personal physician.

594
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,480
You have to get me out of here.

595
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,200
I had to come

596
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,520
and say thank you.

597
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,680
What you did for me...

598
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,840
it was above and beyond anything
that anyone's ever done for me.

599
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,760
Thank you.

600
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
That's one more on the resume.

601
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,920
Consider it a parting gift.

602
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,520
Hey.

603
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,360
You don't have to deflect.

604
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,280
I know you're trying.

605
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,920
I'm sorry, Mary.

606
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,000
It's okay.

607
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,200
No.

608
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,920
I'm really...

609
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,560
I'm really sorry.

610
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,000
What did you do?

611
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,880
Let's have some fun.
