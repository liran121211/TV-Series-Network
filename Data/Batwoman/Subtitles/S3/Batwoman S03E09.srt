1
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,511
- AAH!
- OHH!

2
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:34,860
AAH!

3
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:39,169
HELP! AAH!

4
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,086
OHH! AAH!

5
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,348
UGH!

6
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,287
PAM!

7
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:13,029
PAM?

8
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,206
OHH! OHH!

9
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,860
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:22,343
I THOUGHT THE WATER
WOULD REVIVE ME.

11
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:25,476
I WAS WRONG.

12
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:29,437
I NEED TO GET MY STRENGTH BACK.

13
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,004
OH!

14
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,194
HOW'D YOU DO IT, MAMA?

15
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:50,110
3 JOBS, VOLUNTEERING AT CHURCH,

16
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:51,720
RAISING ME.

17
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:54,810
YOU WERE LITERALLY
EVERYTHING TO EVERYONE,

18
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,594
AND YOU DIDN'T BREAK A SWEAT.

19
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:04,254
I JUST...

20
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,430
I CAN'T GET OUT OF MY DAMN HEAD.

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,131
WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?

22
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,969
PRETTY SURE IN THE REAL WORLD

23
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,884
THIS WOULD BE AN HR VIOLATION

24
00:02:25,928 --> 00:02:28,452
OF APPROPRIATE
WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR.

25
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,019
GOOD THING IT'S NOT
THE REAL WORLD.

26
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:31,760
YEAH. WELL, HURRY UP

27
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,303
BECAUSE YOU'RE BREATHING
LIKE DARTH VADER

28
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:35,067
AND MAKING ME FEEL BAD
ABOUT THAT BAGEL

29
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:36,721
I HAD FOR BREAKFAST.

30
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:39,028
GREAT. THEN YOU CAN HELP.

31
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:49,256
- YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
- NOPE.

32
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,345
DOES RYAN KNOW?

33
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:52,781
NOPE.

34
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,872
DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH MARQUIS JET?

35
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:02,878
NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD SEE THE JADA JET

36
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,489
LOOK SO DEFEATED.

37
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,163
WHEN I GOT YOUR MESSAGE,
IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU'D BEEN PUT

38
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,362
THROUGH A WRINGER OR TWO.

39
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,668
JOHN DIGGLE...

40
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,628
IT'S GOOD TO SEE
YOU, OLD FRIEND.

41
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,977
SO...

42
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:20,287
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME

43
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,289
HOW AN OLD FRIEND CAN HELP?

44
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:26,771
SUNLIGHT'S NOT WORKING.

45
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:30,079
IT'S BEEN 10 YEARS, PAM.

46
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,037
GIVE YOURSELF SOME TIME.

47
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:36,216
TIME? I'VE HAD NOTHING BUT TIME.

48
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,913
NO. SOMETHING'S WRONG.

49
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:40,872
MY ENERGY'S DEPLETING
SO QUICKLY.

50
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,309
DIDN'T STOP YOU FROM ATTACKING

51
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,049
TWO INNOCENT FISHERMEN.

52
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,445
THE LAKE'S CATCH AND RELEASE.

53
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:49,794
THEY WERE CREATING AN IMBALANCE

54
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,492
IN AN ALREADY
VULNERABLE SPECIES.

55
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:54,016
OH. 10 YEARS, AND SUDDENLY,

56
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:55,670
IT'S LIKE YESTERDAY.

57
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,598
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
WOULD HAPPEN

58
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,458
WHEN YOU FREED ME?

59
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,286
I WASN'T.

60
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,809
I GOT WRAPPED UP IN THE MOMENT,

61
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,507
SEEING YOU, THE WHITE TULIP,

62
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,248
THE MEMORIES, THE GUILT.

63
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:13,296
AH. I'M SO SORRY THAT YOU
HAD TO FEEL GUILT, RENEE,

64
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,993
WHILE I ROTTED FOR A DECADE

65
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,431
WITH NO WATER, NO SUNLIGHT,

66
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,781
NO SOUL MATE.

67
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:22,914
MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY AWFUL FOR YOU.

68
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,525
I AM SORRY, PAM.

69
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,744
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THAT?

70
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,313
I NEEDED YOU...

71
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,620
MORE THAN ANYTHING,

72
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,535
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT PUT ME THERE.

73
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,148
I KNOW HOW TO GET
YOUR STRENGTH BACK.

74
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:49,201
I COME BEARING SUSTENANCE.

75
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,300
VERY MATURE.

76
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:01,712
I WAS ABLE TO KEEP JADA
OFF OUR BACKS

77
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,955
WHILE WE HUNT PAM ISLEY.

78
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,827
"DEAD FISHERMAN AT LOEB LAKE"?

79
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,133
FOUND WITH WEEDS
TANGLED AROUND HIS LEGS.

80
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:09,787
SO THIS IS HAPPENING?

81
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:11,243
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
THE SILENT TREATMENT

82
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,921
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES?

83
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,488
UH, A LITTLE BUSY, SOPH.

84
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:15,813
UH, YOUR GIRLFRIEND RENEE
IS ON THE LOOSE

85
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,229
WITH AN ECOTERRORIST.

86
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,796
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

87
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,687
OK. UH, SO CAN WE ASSUME
THAT THE DEAD FISHERMAN

88
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,931
IS THE O.G. IVY AND NOT MARY

89
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:25,847
CONSIDERING, HE'S,
YOU KNOW, DEAD?

90
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,284
THERE WAS ALSO
AN UNNATURAL HORNET ATTACK

91
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,870
REPORTED AT A PESTICIDE
FACTORY LAST NIGHT.

92
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:31,069
INJURED 6 EMPLOYEES.

93
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,680
MATCHES WHAT I FOUND.

94
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,377
A NEARBY DRILLING
OPERATION GOT SHUT DOWN

95
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,248
BECAUSE OF A TIPPED OIL RIG.

96
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,425
OK. ALL THESE ATTACKS
ARE ENVIRONMENT-BASED.

97
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:39,904
THAT'S PAM ISLEY'S M.O.

98
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:41,906
I'LL TRIANGULATE THESE SITES.

99
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,561
EVEN IF WE DO FIND HER,
THEN WHAT?

100
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:47,259
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
WORKING ON THAT.

101
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:50,741
SO THE DARTS ARE FILLED WITH A
PARALYTIC DRUG AND A HERBICIDE.

102
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,656
SO IT WON'T KILL HER.

103
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,789
IT'LL JUST SLOW DOWN
HER SYSTEM LONG ENOUGH

104
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:57,748
FOR US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
RE-CREATE THE DESICCATION SERUM.

105
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,750
GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS.

106
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:08,498
ALL OF THESE ATTACKS ARE
WITHIN A TWO-MILE RADIUS

107
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,152
OF A GENERAL LOCATION.

108
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,719
SUPPOSED TO START
WITH THE BAD NEWS.

109
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:13,155
BAD NEWS IS...

110
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:14,983
THIS IS THE LOCATION.

111
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,463
THE NATIONAL PARK?

112
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:17,942
WE'RE GONNA BE HUNTING
MOTHER NATURE

113
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:20,423
IN THE MIDDLE OF MOTHER NATURE?

114
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,120
I'M DOWN IF YOU ARE.

115
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,296
HEH. EVER WATCH A HORROR MOVIE?

116
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,950
WHEN BLACK PEOPLE GO
INTO THE WOODS,

117
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,430
THEY USUALLY DON'T COME OUT.

118
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:30,694
BLACK PEOPLE NEVER
WRITE THOSE MOVIES.

119
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,175
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
FLIP THE SCRIPT?

120
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,054
I HAD NO IDEA THINGS
HAD GOTTEN THIS BAD.

121
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,665
WHEN MARQUIS WAKES UP,

122
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,754
THERE'S NO DOUBT HE'LL
GO AFTER HIS SISTER.

123
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,538
THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU.

124
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,154
I WANT TO OFFER YOU
A JOB AS HEAD

125
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:57,765
OF MY SECURITY DETAIL.

126
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:00,289
YOU'D BE PROTECTING
RYAN, ME, THE COMPANY

127
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,291
LIKE OLD TIMES EXCEPT
FRANKLIN'S NOT IN CHARGE.

128
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,727
I AM.

129
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,294
WELL, THEN IT'S EXACTLY
LIKE OLD TIMES.

130
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:13,302
I KNOW THERE'S A WAY
TO FIX MY BOY.

131
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,391
CALL IT HUBRIS OR NAIVETEÉ

132
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,611
OR A MOTHER'S WILL,
BUT I WILL NOT

133
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:19,177
LOCK HIM UP IN AN ARKHAM CELL

134
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,875
FOR SOMETHING THAT
WASN'T HIS FAULT.

135
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:24,618
JADA, I APPRECIATE
YOU THINKING OF ME.

136
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:27,447
THANK YOU, BUT I CAN'T ACCEPT.

137
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,453
WHEN YOU OFFERED TO COME BY
IN PERSON, I GOT MY HOPES UP.

138
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:36,586
WELL, I JUST SO HAPPENED TO
BE IN GOTHAM ON OTHER MATTERS.

139
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,477
YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
HELPING YOUR SON'S PSYCHOSIS

140
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:39,894
BY GOING BACK TO THE SOURCE?

141
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:41,983
THE JOKER'S JOY BUZZER?

142
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:43,985
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

143
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:47,118
EVERY NEUROLOGIST
I'VE TALKED TO SAYS

144
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,512
THAT ANOTHER JOLT WOULD
REAWAKEN HIS EMPATHY,

145
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:51,601
BUT I HAVE SPENT MILLIONS
LOOKING FOR THE BUZZER,

146
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:54,386
BUT NO ONE'S SEEN IT SINCE THE
JOKER DISAPPEARED YEARS AGO.

147
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,651
- IT'S GONE.
- MAYBE IT'S NOT.

148
00:07:57,694 --> 00:08:01,219
BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR NEWS.

149
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:04,614
THE MAD HATTER,
KILLER CROC, MR. FREEZE,

150
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:06,486
ALL BATMAN'S ENEMIES,

151
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,923
AND NOW THEIR WEAPONS
JUST SHOW UP OUT OF NOWHERE?

152
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,881
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
PART OF SOME COLLECTION?

153
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,449
I THINK THEY WERE, YEAH,

154
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,296
AND SOMEHOW, THEY MADE
THEIR WAY ONTO THE STREET.

155
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,061
AND CONSIDERING THE JOKER WAS

156
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,499
BATMAN'S GREATEST ENEMY,

157
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,979
MAYBE THE BUZZER'S
OUT THERE NOW, TOO.

158
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:24,808
I HAD SOME FOLKS OVER AT A.R.G.U.S.
LOOK INTO THIS.

159
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:27,507
A FORMER POLICE OFFICER,
A RENEE MONTOYA,

160
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,771
NOW WORKS FOR THE MAYOR'S
OFF-BOOKS ROGUES UNIT,

161
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,600
LOOKING INTO ALL
OF THESE EVENTS.

162
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:35,993
MAYBE IT'S WORTH
THE TWO OF US POPPING BY

163
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,473
TO SAY HELLO.

164
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:42,783
I READ ABOUT THIS PHENOMENON

165
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:44,567
WHERE PLANTS COMMUNICATE

166
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:47,309
THROUGH ACOUSTICS IN THE GROUND.

167
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:49,964
WIND BLOWS
AT A CERTAIN FREQUENCY,

168
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,357
FUNGI SEND DISTRESS SIGNALS.

169
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,185
IT'S CALLED NATURAL NETWORKING.

170
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,665
THAT'S KIND OF HOT.

171
00:08:57,145 --> 00:09:01,366
YOU... READING GLASSES ON,

172
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,890
HEAD IN A BOOK,

173
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,153
THINKING ABOUT FUNGI.

174
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,592
I FIGURED THE CUTTING
BATMAN SAVED

175
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,463
INFECTED MARY HAMILTON
FOR A REASON.

176
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:14,379
HMM. MY SPORELING.

177
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,033
YOUR WHAT?

178
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:20,298
A PIECE OF ME CREATED HER
TO BRING ME BACK TO HEALTH

179
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:23,737
LIKE A BATTERY WITHOUT A PLUG.

180
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,479
IF I CAN DRAW HER HERE,
SHE'LL REVIVE ME.

181
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:30,918
WELL... LET'S HOPE
THIS WORKS THEN.

182
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,952
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

183
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:07,084
ONE TRIPLE-SHOT FRAPPE,

184
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,999
EXTRA SWEET CREAM

185
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:13,221
AND CONVENIENTLY
FREE OF CHARGE. HEE!

186
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,745
OH, AND I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU.

187
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:22,012
HOW ABOUT AN ALL-INCLUSIVE
VACATION TO SANTORINI?

188
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,666
WHY SANTORINI?

189
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,627
UH, CUTE BIKINIS,
NONSTOP SUNSHINE,

190
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,237
FAR, FAR AWAY FROM GOTHAM.

191
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,500
NEED I GO ON?

192
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,676
TCH! NOPE.

193
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,417
AHH. BUT I'M IN CHARGE
OF THE MUSIC.

194
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,288
I REFUSE TO LISTEN
TO A BOY BAND SING

195
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,160
ABOUT CONDIMENTS FOR TWO HOURS.

196
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:42,511
BRAIN FREEZE.

197
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,950
AGH. NOT A BRAIN FREEZE.

198
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,518
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

199
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:50,954
I HAVE NO IDEA.

200
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:58,483
LOOK. I ADMIT I ROYALLY
SCREWED UP WITH RENEE...

201
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,791
SLEEPING WITH HER, TRUSTING HER,

202
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:04,054
DEFENDING HER, EVERYTHING.

203
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,013
SERIOUSLY, MY BAD, ALL RIGHT?

204
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,450
YEP.

205
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:12,584
THAT'S IT? "YEP"?

206
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,674
I'M TRYING TO BE REAL WITH YOU.

207
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,637
I APPRECIATE THAT,

208
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,508
BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY
FROM THE FACT

209
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:26,294
THAT WE ARE DRIVING INTO THE
WOODS TO FIGHT POISON IVY,

210
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:29,689
WHO RENEE FREED AND
PROBABLY TOLD EVERYTHING TO,

211
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,692
MY IDENTITY, OUR PLAN,
OUR VULNERABILITIES.

212
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,171
WHOA! LOOK OUT!

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,089
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME! PLEASE!

214
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,570
OH, MY GOD!

215
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:42,876
YOU'RE OK. WE GOT YOU.

216
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,747
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!

217
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,333
- WE'RE NOT SAFE.
- WAIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

218
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:47,750
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

219
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,587
SOPHIE!

220
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,154
CRAP!

221
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:18,563
RUN!

222
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,669
UGH!

223
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:38,932
I C... I CAN'T.

224
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:40,585
NO. WE HAVE TO KEEP MOVING.

225
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,546
COME ON, COME ON.

226
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,287
LUKE, GUN!

227
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,854
GUN, GUN!

228
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,340
OK. LUKE, WE GOT TO GO.
WE GOT TO GO!

229
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,689
LUKE, WE GOT TO GO!

230
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,387
GUYS, THE CABIN. LET'S GO!

231
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,622
NOW WHAT?

232
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,679
LUKE.

233
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,814
LUKE!

234
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,862
YOU WANT TO TELL US
WHAT'S GOING ON?

235
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,342
WELL, WE JUST SAW
AN INNOCENT MAN

236
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:44,693
GET IMPALED WITH A ROOT,
SO 3 GUESSES.

237
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,434
THAT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

238
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,436
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

239
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,090
HOW DO YOU NOT GET THAT?

240
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,658
OK. WHAT IS
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR

241
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:56,879
OF ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS?

242
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:58,576
THE BATWING SUIT
BREAKS HALF THE TIME

243
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,143
BECAUSE OF ME.

244
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,102
WE COULDN'T SAVE MARY
FROM POISON IVY

245
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:04,582
BECAUSE OF ME.

246
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,846
A FREAKING VINE SNAGGED
THE DART GUN AWAY

247
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,499
BECAUSE OF ME.

248
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,416
MY DAD KNEW ALL ALONG.

249
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,595
THERE WAS ONE REASON
HE DIDN'T GIVE ME THE SUIT

250
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,467
AND ONE REASON ONLY.

251
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,819
I AM NOT A HERO.

252
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:33,742
YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ON THE
JOURNEY TO BEING A HERO?

253
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:38,094
YOU FAIL.

254
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,096
I MEAN, LOOK AT SOPHIE.

255
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,229
ALICE AND PAM BOTH
ESCAPED ON HER WATCH,

256
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:45,362
AND SHE WORKED SECURITY
FOR 5 YEARS.

257
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:50,890
TRUE... AND RYAN, THE
SUPPOSED TEAM DETECTIVE,

258
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,935
DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE
THAT HER ROOMMATE

259
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,197
WAS INFECTED WITH POISON IVY

260
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:55,633
UNTIL IT WAS WAY TOO LATE.

261
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:58,245
TALK ABOUT SCREWING UP BIG TIME.

262
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:01,335
- SEE? NO ONE'S PERFECT.
- HMM.

263
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,858
YOU CAN'T SPIRAL ON US.

264
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,773
WE NEED YOUR OBNOXIOUSLY
SUPERIOR BRAIN

265
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,167
TO GET US OUT OF HERE.

266
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,734
ALL RIGHT. WELL, SHOTGUN,

267
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:12,955
HANDFUL OF SHELLS,
VINEGAR, BAKING SODA,

268
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,740
A SAW, AND A WHOLE BUNCH
OF OTHER CRAP FROM THIS CABIN.

269
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:18,613
YOU THINK YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
ANOTHER WAY TO TAKE HER DOWN?

270
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,753
I CAN TRY.

271
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:42,332
I TAKE IT YOU DIDN'T FIND MARY.

272
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,683
I HAD OTHER COMPANY.

273
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:48,425
WHAT DID YOU DO?

274
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:51,254
HOW DID BATWOMAN KNOW
WHERE I'D BE?

275
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:52,952
PAM...

276
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,130
ANSWER ME RIGHT NOW.

277
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,132
WHAT DID YOU DO?

278
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:02,048
THEY'RE FINE,

279
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,484
BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT ME
WONDERING WHY

280
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,007
YOU'RE SO CONCERNED.

281
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,400
THEY'RE NOT BAD PEOPLE.

282
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,054
BATMAN BURIED ME ALIVE.

283
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:10,186
I TOLD YOU RYAN IS NOT BATMAN.

284
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,232
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'S GONNA DO TO ME?

285
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,016
- LET ME TALK TO HER.
- AND TELL HER WHAT?

286
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,496
THAT YOU CAN CHANGE.

287
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,457
I'M SORRY, PAM, FOR HURTING YOU.

288
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:24,331
I WILL REGRET WHAT I DID
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

289
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:27,595
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP
GOING DOWN THIS PATH.

290
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,597
I WANT YOU TO BE
HEALTHY AND SAFE.

291
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,729
I WANT US TO BE ABLE TO HEAL

292
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:35,037
AND LEAVE THIS CITY BEHIND.

293
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,083
CAN I ALONE BE WORTH IT?

294
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:43,045
OF COURSE YOU'RE WORTH IT.

295
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:56,015
AND ONE DAY, WE WILL
LEAVE THIS CITY BEHIND US...

296
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,452
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I NEED TO MAKE SURE

297
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:00,454
NO ONE'S STANDING IN MY WAY.

298
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,200
STAY PUT.

299
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:08,940
DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

300
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,215
I'M GOING TO KILL BATWOMAN,

301
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,478
AND THEN WE CAN WORK ON US.

302
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,920
LOOKS LIKE THE CITY
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH HOPE

303
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:33,661
FOR THE ROGUES UNIT.

304
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,621
SHE'S NOT HERE.

305
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,846
YOU GOT A HAIRPIN
IN THAT FANCY THING?

306
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,070
THANK YOU.

307
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,728
GIVE ME.

308
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:04,126
YOU CAN TAKE THE GIRL
OUT OF THE STREETS,

309
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,085
BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE THE
STREETS OUT OF THE GIRL.

310
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,784
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED
ONE BIT, HAVE YOU, JADA?

311
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,046
HEH.

312
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,007
I GOT BACK WITH MY WIFE.

313
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,357
LUCKY HER.

314
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,979
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

315
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,331
LIKE YOU SAID,

316
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,028
THESE BELONGED TO BATMAN,

317
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,900
THEN SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO FALL INTO THE RIVER

318
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:42,686
AND INTO THE HANDS
OF WOULD-BE KILLERS.

319
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,081
I THINK A CERTAIN HERO HAS
SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.

320
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,697
GREAT.

321
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,830
I FEEL BETTER SINCE WE TURNED.

322
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:58,267
OK. GOOD. YEAH.

323
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:00,748
SANTORINI, HERE WE COME.

324
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:06,014
UGH! AGH!

325
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:08,669
OK. ATTACK. TURN BACK.

326
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,975
COME ON. DO YOU WANT
TO RUN OUT OF GAS?

327
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:14,414
ALICE... I'M SERIOUS.
STOP THE CAR.

328
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:16,155
NO.

329
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:19,984
- I SAID STOP!
- OH! UGH!

330
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,987
UNH!

331
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:26,513
STOP! I AM SUPPOSED
TO BE THE CRAZY ONE!

332
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,273
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE WITH
A BITCH OF A MIGRAINE

333
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:31,126
THAT ONLY SEEMS TO STOP
BITCHING WHEN I GO...

334
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,084
THIS WAY!

335
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:36,740
IF YOU GO THAT WAY,
YOU'LL PROBABLY DIE!

336
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,398
THE O.G.'s BACK?

337
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,835
SHE'S TRYING TO DRAW YOU TO HER.

338
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:48,012
- WHY?
- UH, DO I LOOK LIKE

339
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,642
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE POISON IVY FAN CLUB?

340
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,712
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DO KNOW

341
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:55,237
THAT A WORLD WITH TWO OF
A KIND NEVER ENDS WELL.

342
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,805
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
POOR, BORING BETH KANE?

343
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:00,329
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU
CAN'T BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD!

344
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:04,203
OK. THEN THAT'S WHY I'VE
BEEN FEELING THIS WAY?

345
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:12,428
CLEARLY... W-W-WE HAVE
SOME SORT OF BOND,

346
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:16,432
AND SHE'S CALLING OUT TO ME.

347
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,391
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

348
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:21,089
WERE YOU NOT LISTENING
TO ANYTHING I SAID?

349
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,309
I'M GOING, ALICE.

350
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:25,485
THIS IS THE WOMAN WHO
UNLOCKED MY PROWESS

351
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:28,270
AND THE REASON WHY
I'M FINALLY HAPPY.

352
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:31,708
THE LEAST I CAN DO IS GO
AND SEE WHAT SHE WANTS.

353
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:32,927
PLEASE.

354
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,368
FINE. LET'S GO MEET YOUR MAKER.

355
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:45,592
TEQUILA?

356
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:47,035
IS THIS THE PART
WHERE I SAY, "YES,"

357
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:48,638
AND YOU PASS IT TO LUKE?

358
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,339
IT'S WHERE I THANK YOU
FOR GRABBING MY BATSUIT

359
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:57,038
WHILE YOUR CAR WAS
BEING SUCKED INTO THE ABYSS.

360
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:58,518
YOU'RE A BADASS.

361
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:04,437
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

362
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,308
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH ME?

363
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:09,529
HEY. I HAVEN'T BROUGHT UP
RENEE ONCE SINCE WE GOT HERE.

364
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,707
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT RENEE,

365
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,796
AND YOU CAN PRETEND ALL YOU WANT

366
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,861
THAT OUR PROBLEMS STARTED
WHEN SHE CAME INTO OUR LIVES,

367
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:21,018
BUT IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

368
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,934
OH, YOU MEAN BACK WHEN YOU
THOUGHT I WAS A COMMON CRIMINAL?

369
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,719
IS THAT WHY YOU DON'T LIKE ME?

370
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:30,071
I HAVE APOLOGIZED, I'VE CHANGED.

371
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:33,335
RYAN, I LITERALLY
QUIT MY JOB IN PART

372
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:34,728
BECAUSE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP

373
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:37,339
AND WHAT I LEARNED FROM YOU.

374
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:39,646
I'M TRYING, OK,

375
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:41,188
BUT I'M NOT GETTING
ANYTHING IN RETURN.

376
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:42,388
WHAT DO YOU WANT IN RETURN?

377
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,085
WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

378
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:48,219
- OHH.
- LOOK. NO OFFENSE,

379
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:51,005
BUT, SOPHIE, I HAVE
SO MUCH GOING ON

380
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:53,355
IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT.

381
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:54,835
YOU THINK?

382
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:56,358
HALF THE TIME, I DON'T KNOW

383
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:58,578
IF YOU LIKE ME OR HATE ME,

384
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:00,449
AND HONESTLY, I THINK
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID.

385
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,973
- AFRAID OF WHAT?
- OF FEELING SOMETHING REAL

386
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:04,975
AND BLOWING IT.

387
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:07,108
SO WHAT IS IT?

388
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,718
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

389
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:15,029
- SOPH!
- AAH! OHH!

390
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:29,435
- MOVE.
- WHAT?!

391
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:30,784
MOVE!

392
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,404
SALT AND VINEGAR.

393
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,798
WHY ARE WE WHISPERING?

394
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,800
IMAGINE EACH
OF THE TRILLION SPORES

395
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:49,629
IN THESE WOODS AS ONE OF
POISON IVY'S SENSORY GLANDS.

396
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,631
SHE CAN SENSE SOUND VIBRATIONS.

397
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,850
YEAH. SO BETWEEN THE HAMMERING

398
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:55,635
AND... THE ARGUING...

399
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,376
WE DREW HER RIGHT TO US.

400
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:00,727
WELL, GAME ON, BITCH.

401
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,206
LOAD UP TWO MORE OF THOSE.

402
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,773
WE'RE GOING
ON A POISON IVY HUNT.

403
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,137
I WISH I COULD,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

404
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,516
THAT WAS THE LAST OF THE SALT.

405
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,605
WAIT. ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

406
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:11,520
I SAW A BAG OF ICE
MELT IN THE TRUCK

407
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,827
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

408
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,483
THE TRUCK IN THE DRIVEWAY
OUTSIDE, OUT THERE

409
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:19,093
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THESE WALLS?

410
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,008
OR WE CAN JUST
STAY COOPED UP IN HERE

411
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:22,749
AND SECOND-GUESS
EACH OTHER TO DEATH,

412
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,315
SAVE PAM THE EFFORT.

413
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,753
OK. UM, WE COULD DRAW
STRAWS TO SEE WHO GOES.

414
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,759
I'LL SAVE US THE TROUBLE.
I'M BATWOMAN.

415
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:34,195
I'LL GO.

416
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:47,295
SHE'S CLOSE.

417
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:49,515
I CAN FEEL HER WARM PULL.

418
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,435
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

419
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,741
WELL, SHE NAMED HERSELF
POISON IVY.

420
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:02,223
WHY NOT DELICATE LILAC
OR DAINTY LILY?

421
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:03,920
MAYBE BECAUSE SHE'S
A MASS MURDERER!

422
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:06,183
ALICE, WE ARE NOT TIRE IRONING

423
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:09,012
THE WOMAN RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY AWAKENING.

424
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,407
LOOK. AHEM.

425
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,062
I GET THIS WHOLE BONE OF MY
BONE, FLESH OF MY FLESH THING

426
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:17,978
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW,
BUT, UH, THIS ISN'T ENDING

427
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,589
WITH THE TWO OF YOU WINDING
YOUR LITTLE VINES TOGETHER

428
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,373
AND MAKING A PEACE WREATH.

429
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:26,682
ARE YOU JEALOUS? WHAT... WHAT
IS HAPPENING HERE?

430
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,162
WHAT ARE YOU SO WORRIED ABOUT?

431
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:30,033
YOU ENDING UP DEAD!

432
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:38,999
BECAUSE THE, UM,
TICKETS TO SANTORINI

433
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,915
ARE... IN YOUR NAME,
AND IF YOU DIE,

434
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,265
I WILL MISS OUT
ON THE SPA RETREAT, SO...

435
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:57,321
WHY DO WE WORK, ALICE?

436
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:59,106
YOU KILLED MY MOM,

437
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:02,196
I REPLACED YOU IN OUR FAMILY,

438
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,415
BUT...

439
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:07,375
HERE WE ARE ON THIS
CRAZY ADVENTURE TOGETHER.

440
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:11,248
HMM? WHY?

441
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:14,774
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU MADE ME DRIVE
OUT TO "DELIVERANCE" COUNTRY.

442
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:20,736
IT'S BECAUSE DESPITE
ALL OF OUR BAGGAGE,

443
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,522
WE BOTH FOUND THE
SISTER WE ALWAYS WANTED.

444
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:29,615
I SEE THE GIRL WHO...

445
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:32,879
JUST CRAVES HER FREEDOM,

446
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:34,881
AND I LOVE THAT YOU SUPPORT ME

447
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:36,926
TO DO WHAT I WANT...

448
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,670
AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT.

449
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:47,110
OK.

450
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,594
I HATE TO HAVE TO PULL
THIS CARD, SIS,

451
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:56,032
BUT, UM... TOUGH BEANS.
I'M OLDER.

452
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:59,383
ALICE... STOP.

453
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:00,907
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

454
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,865
YOU'RE STAYING RIGHT HERE.

455
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:05,564
I'M GOING ALONE.

456
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:08,044
YOU'RE NOT GONNA STOP ME.

457
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:09,568
NIGHTY NIGHT.

458
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,580
FINALLY MAKING YOURSELF USEFUL.

459
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,016
WELL, THEY HAD NO BORDEAUX

460
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:25,148
IN THAT MINI FRIDGE OVER THERE.

461
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:27,760
LET'S SEE IF SHE HAS
AN OPENER ROUND HERE.

462
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,594
SO HOW'D SHE FIND YOU?

463
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,555
YOUR DAUGHTER.

464
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:45,778
DAUGHTER?

465
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:48,694
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY HEARD
HER DESCRIBED TO ME THAT WAY.

466
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,652
WELL, IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME ASKING,

467
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,456
WHAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM
TREATING HER THAT WAY?

468
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:57,703
LOOK AT ME, JOHN.

469
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,705
I JUST BROKE INTO CITY HALL

470
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,794
TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP
MY SON FROM BECOMING

471
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:04,492
ANOTHER MONSTER ON A CORK BOARD.

472
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,407
THE CLOSER I GET TO RYAN,

473
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,975
THE FASTER SHE BECOMES
A POTENTIAL VICTIM.

474
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,716
AND YET YOU SMILED JUST NOW

475
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,239
WHEN I BROUGHT UP HER NAME.

476
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:24,643
I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE FOUND ME, BUT...

477
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:30,605
MAYBE THERE'S A PART OF ME
THAT'S HAPPY THAT SHE DID.

478
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,477
WELL, MAYBE... HEAR ME OUT HERE...

479
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:36,393
JUST MAYBE IF YOU
DROPPED YOUR GUARD

480
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:38,700
FOR A MINUTE
AND OPENED YOURSELF UP

481
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:40,702
TO OTHER POSSIBILITIES,

482
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,878
THAT THING YOU THOUGHT WOULD
BE YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE

483
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:45,925
MIGHT JUST BE THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU, JADA.

484
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:17,652
FORGET THAT BEER, JOHN.

485
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,220
WE'RE GONNA NEED
THAT BORDEAUX AFTER ALL.

486
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,791
WE'RE CELEBRATING.

487
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:53,601
HEY. WHERE'S PAM?

488
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:55,821
I CAN'T LET YOU FIND HER.

489
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:31,857
GOOD LUCK.

490
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,064
HERE I AM TRYING TO TEACH
YOU AN IMPORTANT LIFE SKILL,

491
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:06,848
AND YOU'RE MORE
INTERESTED IN MY PHONE.

492
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:09,677
MOMMY SAID WE HAVE TO
MAKE MEM-OH-WEES.

493
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,593
MEMORIES, BUD, BUT
YOUR MOTHER IS RIGHT...

494
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:15,726
AHH... AS ALWAYS. HEH.

495
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,859
HEY.

496
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,556
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

497
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,739
OH.

498
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:32,178
HEY. HEY. HELLO?

499
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,701
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO YOU, GIRL?

500
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,964
- GET AWAY FROM ME!
- WHOA, WHOA!

501
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:37,270
AAH!

502
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:41,100
DAD!

503
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:00,510
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

504
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:02,382
HER DAMN ARMS
AREN'T LONG ENOUGH.

505
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,079
RYAN, ON COMMS: I CAN HEAR YOU.

506
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,103
I CAN'T WATCH.

507
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,118
IF YOU COULD GRAB BOTH,

508
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:44,163
THAT'D BE EVEN BETTER.

509
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:45,338
YOU GRAB BOTH.

510
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,948
OK. ONE IT IS.

511
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,432
WHAT IN THE ACTUAL HELL?

512
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,134
BATWOMAN, HELP!

513
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:00,788
OH, MY GOD.

514
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:05,706
RUN!

515
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,753
OHH!

516
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:18,893
LUKE, GET READY TO RUN.

517
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,721
- SOPHIE, I NEED YOU!
- TALK TO ME.

518
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:22,288
- BLOW UP THE TRUCK.
- WHAT?!

519
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:24,116
YOU ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED.

520
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,466
BLOW UP THE TRUCK.
THE SUIT WILL PROTECT ME.

521
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:27,728
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

522
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:29,121
BLOW UP THE DAMN TRUCK!

523
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:30,426
HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO...

524
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,037
SHOOT IT, HOTSHOT!

525
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,444
HEY. HEY. YOU GOOD?

526
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,055
YOU SAVED ME.

527
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:02,981
HERE YOU GO.

528
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:07,202
HEY. THE PARK RANGERS
ARE LOOKING FOR YOUR DAD,

529
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:09,944
AND THEY'RE GONNA FIND HIM, OK?

530
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:18,997
SOPHIE, CHECKING IN.
ANY SIGN OF HER?

531
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,174
RYAN. RYAN!

532
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:27,135
LUKE, I FOUND HER. SHE'S ALIVE.

533
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:30,269
UGH. I'M OK. UGH. I'M FINE.

534
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:36,449
FINE? THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY?

535
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:38,538
YOU ALMOST DIED.

536
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:40,192
SHE'S TOO STRONG FOR US.

537
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,889
WE NEED TO MAKE IT HOME,

538
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:43,369
MAKE A REPLICA OF LUKE'S GUN,

539
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:45,066
AND... AND FIND SOME MORE
OF THAT SERUM.

540
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,589
RYAN, LOOK AT ME.

541
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,287
NEVER PUT ME IN THAT
POSITION AGAIN.

542
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,984
IT STOPPED HER, DIDN'T IT?

543
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,768
- YOU COULD HAVE DIED!
- YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T.

544
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:53,074
BUT YOU COULD HAVE.

545
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,597
OH, WELL!

546
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:57,209
WHAT?! RYAN, NO.

547
00:33:57,252 --> 00:34:00,081
YOU DON'T GET TO "OH,
WELL" ME AND WALK AWAY.

548
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,257
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

549
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:05,565
I'M FREAKING EXHAUSTED, SOPHIE.

550
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,610
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I WANT?

551
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:10,309
I WANT TO SLEEP.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

552
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,180
I HAVE A FAMILY I DIDN'T ASK FOR

553
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:14,008
TRYING TO DESTROY MY CITY,

554
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,228
MY... MY BEST FRIEND
IS OFF THE GRID

555
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:18,012
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SO PREOCCUPIED

556
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,928
I DIDN'T NOTICE SHE WAS
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSON,

557
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:25,150
AND NOW A BATMAN SUPERVILLAIN
JUST KICKED ALL OF OUR ASSES,

558
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:27,239
SO, YEAH, THE THOUGHT
OF BLOWING UP

559
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:30,894
IN A FIERY EXPLOSION HONESTLY
SOUNDS LIKE A VACATION TO ME...

560
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,380
MAYBE THAT'LL GET YOU
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

561
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:42,602
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

562
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:44,952
TO LOOK FOR MY DAMN CAR.

563
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:52,090

564
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,092
OK. THEN.

♪ YEAH, THAT'S MY LOVE

566
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,812
A FRIEND OF MINE
TOLD ME THIS WORKED FOR HER,

567
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:04,014
SO I FIGURED WHAT THE HELL?

568
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:06,452
LOOK, DAD.

569
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:10,064
I GET WHY YOU DON'T THINK
I'M READY TO BE BATWING

570
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,241
BECAUSE YOU AND I
AND A WHOLE LOT

571
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:14,895
OF O.R. DOCTORS KNOW
THAT I'M NOT

572
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:17,811
EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

573
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:20,596
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE GROUND NEXT TO YOU

574
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,729
WITH A SEVERED VEIN
AND 3 RUPTURED ORGANS,

575
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:27,560
BUT... THANKS TO SOME LUCKY,
IMPOSSIBLE, FREAK MIRACLE,

576
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:30,432
I'M NOT.

577
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:32,565
I'M STILL HERE.

578
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,353
BUT WHAT IF...

579
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:44,011
WHAT IF IT WASN'T
A FREAK MIRACLE?

580
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:47,493
WHAT IF YOUR DEATH WASN'T
A TRAGEDY?

581
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,843
WHAT IF ALL
THESE HORRIBLE THINGS

582
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:53,499
THAT HAPPENED TO ME
HAPPENED FOR A REASON?

583
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:57,155
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
I'M STARTING TO THINK,

584
00:35:57,198 --> 00:36:00,332
AND...

585
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:04,031
AS HARD AS IT IS TO SAY,

586
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:05,989
I CAN'T KEEP CARING
ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD THINK

587
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:10,037
BECAUSE... DAD, I'M READY,

588
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,387
AND I LOVE YOU, AND I MISS YOU,

589
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:13,606
BUT...

590
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:17,740
I CAN'T LET YOU
HOLD ME BACK ANYMORE.

591
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,354

HEY. SORRY, MAN.

593
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,013
I TRIED, BUT I CAN'T
GET IT OPEN.

594
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:31,798
AW, DAMN IT.

595
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,017
GOT THAT SAME LINE
FROM A.R.G.U.S.

596
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:36,672
FIGURED I HAD A FIGHTING
CHANCE WITH YOUR BATTECH.

597
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:38,152
TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE

598
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,869
ACCESS TO OUR BEST
RESOURCES AT THE MOMENT,

599
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:42,678
BUT FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,
THE TECHNOLOGY USED

600
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:45,290
ON A TRANSMATTER CUBE
PROBABLY ISN'T

601
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,161
FROM AROUND HERE, IS IT?

602
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,078
WHICH IS WHY I'D APPRECIATE
YOU KEEPING THIS BETWEEN US.

603
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,732
HOW'D YOU GET IT OPEN LAST TIME?

604
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:54,908
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

605
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:57,127
IT JUST OPENED FOR ME.

606
00:36:57,171 --> 00:36:58,999
SO MAYBE THE KEY
TO OPENING THAT BOX

607
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:02,263
ISN'T BASED ON SCIENCE,
HUMAN OR OTHERWISE.

608
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:04,134
MAYBE IT'S...

609
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:06,485
SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.

610
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,401
YEAH.

611
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,840
YEAH.

612
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:15,624
NEED YOU TO DO
ONE MORE FAVOR FOR ME.

613
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:18,236
- OK. WHAT'S THAT?
- GET A MESSAGE TO BATWOMAN.

614
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,368
LET HER KNOW THAT JADA JET
FOUND A FIX.

615
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,240
SHE'S READY TO SAVE HER SON.

616
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,386
SINCE WHEN IS IT DAY?

617
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:04,954
HELLO. WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO YOU, GIRL?

618
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:07,241
- GET AWAY FROM ME!
- WHOA, WHOA!

619
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,158
DAD!

620
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:27,609
OH, LITTLE SISTER...

621
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:29,307
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

622
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:45,845
LET'S JUST CALL THIS WHAT IT IS.

623
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,372
A TOXIC RELATIONSHIP.

624
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:55,115
HOW ARE YOU HERE? I... I...

625
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:57,857
PHEROMONED MY ASS? I KNOW.

626
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,598
I WAS THERE.

627
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:01,489
WHEN I THOUGHT THERE WAS
A CHANCE I'D SEE YOU AGAIN,

628
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:02,992
I CREATED A TOXIN,

629
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:04,559
STARTED INGESTING A DROP A DAY,

630
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:06,431
HOPING I COULD BUILD UP
A TOLERANCE

631
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:08,650
TO YOUR MIND CONTROL.

632
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:10,367
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D DO

633
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,480
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ENDED UP DOING.

634
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:13,699
YOU DON'T LOVE ME.

635
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:15,570
I DO LOVE YOU, PAM.

636
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:18,660
I JUST DON'T LOVE YOU THE
WAY YOU WANT ME TO LOVE YOU.

637
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:20,836
THEN THAT'S NOT LOVE.

638
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,143
IT'S JUDGMENT,

639
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:25,754
AND MAYBE THIS IS
A TOXIC RELATIONSHIP.

640
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:28,104
I'VE SEEN ADDICTS WEEN
THEMSELVES OFF OF HEROIN

641
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:30,280
FASTER THAN WHAT WE'RE
DOING TO EACH OTHER.

642
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:32,021
WHAT DO YOU THINK KEPT ME ALIVE

643
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:34,850
FOR 10 YEARS, RENEE?

644
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:37,418
I HAD NO WATER,

645
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,420
NO SUNLIGHT,

646
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:42,380
NO HUMAN CONTACT.

647
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:45,426
I THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO DIE THERE,

648
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,689
SO WHAT SINGLE THOUGHT
DO YOU THINK

649
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:50,518
I HELD ONTO FOR
EVERY WAKING MOMENT

650
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:52,912

YOU.

652
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:03,792
SO... IF LOVING YOU THROUGH
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

653
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:06,360
IS TOXIC, THEN FINE.

654
