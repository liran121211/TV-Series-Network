1
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,769
SHE'S NOT HERE.

2
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:32,684
YOU STAY SHARP, MONTOYA.

3
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:40,649
PAMELA ISLEY...

4
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:41,998
SHOW YOURSELF!

5
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,089
SURRENDER, OR WE WILL USE FORCE!

6
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,181
I'M RIGHT HERE.

7
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:54,402
STOP! PLEASE.

8
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,534
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS.

9
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:04,803
TAKE THE SHOT, MONTOYA.

10
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,900
NO!

11
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:19,644
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! NO!

12
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:23,387
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

13
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:26,129
BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS TO CARE.

14
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:51,111
FLORA & FAWNA:

15
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:04,385
VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN PULL
OFF GREEN WITH ANY SWAGGER,

16
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:05,948
BUT I ACTUALLY DON'T
HATE THIS FOR YOU.

17
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:11,087
AHH. YEAH. IT'S INTERESTING.

18
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,655
I, UM... I'M SORRY.

19
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:16,179
I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A POSITION BEFORE

20
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:18,616
WHERE I COULDN'T
BE HONEST BECAUSE I WAS

21
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,854
WORRIED ABOUT HURTING SOMEONE'S
FEELINGS, SO I'M STALLING.

22
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,360
AW! I THINK THAT'S
THE SWEETEST THING

23
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:24,404
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

24
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:28,191
- DID YOU ORDER MORE FOOD?
- NO.

25
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:33,327
- DID YOU ORDER MORE STRIPPERS?
- UM...

26
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,112
MS. HAMILTON,
IT'S TIME TO ASK YOU

27
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,027
TO PACK YOUR THINGS
AND PART WAYS WITH US.

28
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,464
UM, RUDE.

29
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,292
YOU'VE RACKED UP AN $8,000 BILL

30
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:46,383
WITHOUT SHOWING
ANY ABILITY TO PAY FOR IT.

31
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,037
OH! I TOLD THE LADY
AT THE DESK 10 TIMES

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,606
TRY ALL MY OTHER CARDS.

33
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,869
THEY'VE ALL BEEN DECLINED,
MS. HAMILTON.

34
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:56,045
OH, ACTUALLY, IT'S DR. HAMILTON.

35
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,525
IT'S NOT MS.

36
00:02:57,568 --> 00:03:02,269
I'M AFRAID I NEED
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE,

37
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:04,793
OR THE METROPOLIS PD
WILL BE ESCORTING YOU OUT.

38
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:14,803
THIS IS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING.

39
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:18,459
GIVE ME SOME TIME
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

40
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:21,505
PLEASE TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED.

41
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,594
WE'LL ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY

42
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:26,206
AND A COMPLIMENTARY BOTTLE
OF DOM

43
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:26,945
FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

44
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,252
YOU'RE VERY KIND, MA'AM.

45
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,341
HA! I KNOW.

46
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:39,654
DID THE BAT BITCHES CUT ME OFF?

47
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:42,265
ALL YOUR FANCY DEGREES, AND
YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING?

48
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,267
I THOUGHT WE WERE PAST THIS.

49
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,071
I MEAN, ONE WOULD THINK
THAT NEARLY VINE-SQUEEZING

50
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:50,317
THE LIFE OUT OF YOUR BESTIE
AND THEN CRUSHING

51
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,144
THE ONLY CURE
FOR YOU IN EXISTENCE

52
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:53,581
WAS A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR

53
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:56,801
THAT IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON
FROM THE FRIENDSHIP.

54
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,890
ANYONE ELSE FIND IT IRONIC
THAT WHEN I BEG

55
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,415
RYAN AND LUKE
FOR THEIR ATTENTION

56
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,199
THEY'RE TOO BUSY
WITH THEIR OWN DRAMA,

57
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,069
BUT THEN WHEN I FINALLY
STEP AWAY

58
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:06,463
FOR SOME MUCH-NEEDED ME TIME,

59
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:09,771
MARY HAMILTON IS THE COVETED
BATMISSION OF THE WEEK?

60
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:13,253
IF THIS IS A LECTURE ON
BEING BATWOMAN'S MOST WANTED,

61
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,255
TRUST ME, I ALREADY
TOOK THE EXAM.

62
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:18,649
WELL, WHAT DO I DO?

63
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:19,215
UH, YOU KILL THEM IMMEDIATELY.

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,259
ALICE.

65
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:27,441
FINE. AS SOMEONE WHO HAD A
SO-CALLED FAMILY MEMBER OBSESSED

66
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,269
WITH THE IDEA THAT
I COULD CHANGE,

67
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,315
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

68
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:35,579
YOU MAKE YOUR FRIENDS
HATE YOU SO MUCH

69
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:36,903
THAT THEY WANT TO
GIVE UP ON YOU.

70
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:16,185
FLOWERS AREN'T A FIX-ALL, PAM.

71
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:19,841
MY PARTNER LOST A KIDNEY.

72
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,408
BUT THEY'RE WHITE TULIPS.

73
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:24,106
TECHNICALLY FROM
THE LILIACEAE FAMILY.

74
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:28,632
THEY SYMBOLIZE FORGIVENESS.

75
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:29,870
WOULD YOU RATHER IT BE A KIDNEY?

76
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:33,158
HA!

77
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:33,811
I'M TRYING HERE, RENEE.

78
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,944
HE COULD HAVE DIED.

79
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:36,597
HE WAS GOING TO SHOOT ME.

80
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,425
BECAUSE I COULDN'T.

81
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:40,775
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE HIS BACK.

82
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:41,882
NO. YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE MY BACK.

83
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:45,867
OHH. DON'T YOU SEE
HOW UNFAIR THAT IS?

84
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,390
I TOOK AN OATH
TO UPHOLD THE LAW,

85
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:48,846
AND YOU'RE OUT THERE
BREAKING IT CONSTANTLY

86
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,263
FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT...
MOTHER NATURE?

87
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:58,967
I KNOW GLOBAL WARMING,
WATER SHORTAGE,

88
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,292
EXTINCTION OF SPECIES IS
AN INCONVENIENT THOUGHT FOR YOU,

89
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:04,799
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THIS REUSABLE COFFEE MUG

90
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:05,842
ISN'T THE SOLUTION.

91
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,631
WHAT IS THE SOLUTION THEN?

92
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:13,590
QUITTING YOUR JOB,
OSTRACIZING OUR FRIENDS,

93
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:15,418
BECOMING SO OBSESSED
TO THE POINT

94
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,464
WHERE I DON'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE YOU?

95
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:19,814
ARE YOU COMING WITH ME OR NOT?

96
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,603
NOT IF YOU GO WHERE
I CAN'T FOLLOW YOU.

97
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:30,128
STAY HERE. STAY THE...

98
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:32,783
QUIRKY, BRILLIANT SCIENTIST
WHO LOVES READING AND BASEBALL

99
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,195
THAT I FELL IN LOVE
WITH A DECADE AGO.

100
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:38,006
SHE'S GONE.

101
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:40,288
SHE'S BLOSSOMED INTO SOMEONE
WHO CAN STAND UP FOR HERSELF

102
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:43,751
AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
FOR THOSE THINGS THAT CAN'T.

103
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:01,812
I FROZE MARY'S BANK ACCOUNTS.
I THINK.

104
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:05,599
INTERNET'S CUT OUT 10 TIMES.

105
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:06,208
AND NOW I HAVE
THE SPINNING WHEEL OF DEATH.

106
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:09,385
THAT'S... AWESOME.

107
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,648
DOES ASBESTOS HAVE A SMELL?

108
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,606
ANYONE SMELL THAT?

109
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,477
DEAD RAT IN THE WALL.

110
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:15,347
GIVE IT 3 DAYS. IT'LL PASS.

111
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,871
WE DON'T HAVE 3 DAYS.

112
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:19,177
YOU SAW HER CLINIC.

113
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,484
IT'S COMPLETELY
OVERRUN BY PLANT LIFE.

114
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,181
YOU DON'T FIND THAT SYMBOLIC?

115
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,052
WE WON'T LET HER FORGET
WHO SHE IS.

116
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,967
OH, HOPE. THAT'S SWEET.

117
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,405
HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

118
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,408
I'M SORRY. I LEFT
MY SARCASM METER

119
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,497
IN THE BATCAVE I NO LONGER
HAVE ACCESS TO.

120
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,368
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU
WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO ME?

121
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:38,153
TAKE OFF THE KID GLOVES, RYAN.

122
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,242
- KID GLOVES?
- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE MARQUIS

123
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:42,026
ARRESTED BECAUSE HE'S FAMILY.

124
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,743
YOU UNDERESTIMATED MARY
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,

125
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,856
AND NOW YOU'RE LOCKED
OUT OF YOUR BATCAVE

126
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,379
AND YOUR BESTIE'S ON THE LAM

127
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:49,512
WITH A SERIAL KILLER.

128
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,663
JUMP IN IF I'M MISSING ANYTHING.

129
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:51,471
OK. WHAT THE HELL
WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,

130
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,908
PUMMEL MARY WITH BATARANGS,

131
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:55,320
LET THEM THROW MARQUIS
IN ARKHAM FOR A BRAIN INJURY

132
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:57,607
THAT ISN'T HIS FAULT?

133
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,783
IT'S CALLED MAKING HARD CHOICES.

134
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:00,697
WHY ARE WE EVEN HERE?
THERE WASN'T A TOXIC SEWER

135
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,960
WITH WI-FI ACCESS?

136
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:05,920
RENEE'S NOT WRONG, RYAN.

137
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:07,922
WE NEED A HARDER STANCE.

138
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:08,662
BY AGREEING WITH THE WOMAN

139
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,925
WHO'S BLACKMAILING ME

140
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:12,796
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SLEEPING WITH HER?

141
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,059
AHEM. WOW. UM, I THINK
I SMELL THAT ASBESTOS.

142
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,341
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO GET SOME AIR.

143
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:19,150
LOOK. I GET IT.
MARY'S YOUR FRIEND.

144
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:20,345
I THOUGHT I COULD PLEAD AND HOPE

145
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,675
AND RATIONALIZE WITH PAM, TOO.

146
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:24,460
IT DIDN'T WORK.
EVENTUALLY, IT GOT TO THE POINT

147
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,548
WHERE SHE MADE ME CHOOSE...

148
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,872
MY OBLIGATION
TO THE CITY OR HER.

149
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:29,117
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

150
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:34,383
SOMETHING PAM WILL NEVER
FORGIVE ME FOR.

151
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:35,732
I SOLD MY SOUL TO BATMAN.

152
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:37,952
HE KNEW HE COULDN'T
TRUST ARKHAM TO CONTAIN HER,

153
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,562
SO HE DEVELOPED
A DESICCATION SERUM

154
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,738
THAT MIMICKED THE PROCESS
A PLANT GOES THROUGH

155
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,479
WHEN IT'S DENIED
WATER OR SUNLIGHT.

156
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,699
THE DEVICE USED TO INJECT IT

157
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:46,850
IS CODED TO THE SERUM,
MEANING IT'S ALSO

158
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,353
THE ONLY WAY
TO EXTRACT IT FROM HER.

159
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:50,791
SO IF WE GOT MORE OF THE SERUM,

160
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:51,443
WE COULD USE IT ON MARY?

161
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,402
I HAVE THE DEVICE,

162
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,622
BUT HE ONLY MADE
ONE DOSE OF SERUM.

163
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:56,361
IT'S CURRENTLY PUMPING THROUGH

164
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:58,015
PAMELA'S BLOODSTREAM.

165
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,340
- SO WHERE IS SHE?
- NO ONE KNOWS.

166
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:00,888
OK, BUT IF WE FIND HER,

167
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,039
THEN PRESUMABLY
WE COULD SIPHON THE SERUM

168
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:05,240
AND USE IT TO STOP MARY, RIGHT?

169
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:07,068
WRONG! FIRST OF ALL,
ACCIDENTALLY UNLEASHING

170
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:10,854
AN ECOTERRORIST WOULD NOT
BE A GOOD LOOK FOR US.

171
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,397
SECOND, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT DESICCATION MEANS?

172
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,076
WE WOULD BE DEHYDRATING
MARY TO THE BRINK OF DEATH.

173
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:17,078
NO. THE SERUM
WAS JUST TO PUT PAM DOWN,

174
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:19,646
AND THAT WAS 10 YEARS AGO.

175
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,865
IF WE REMOVE IT,
MY GUESS IS SHE STAYS DORMANT

176
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,277
UNLESS SHE COMES INTO CONTACT
WITH SUNLIGHT OR WATER.

177
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:27,218
AS FOR POINT NUMBER TWO,
KID GLOVES, RYAN.

178
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,525
DID YOU HEAR WHAT
RENEE JUST SAID?

179
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,198
PAM WILL NEVER FORGIVE HER
FOR WHAT SHE DID TO HER.

180
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:33,070
WE ARE NOT PUTTING MARY
THROUGH THAT SAME TORTURE

181
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:34,704
SO SHE CAN HATE US, TOO.

182
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:36,663
THIS COULD BE
OUR ONLY CHANCE TO SAVE MARY.

183
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,539
THE TRUE MARY WOULD WANT
US TO STOP HER

184
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,125
BEFORE SHE CAN DO SOMETHING
THAT SHE CAN'T TAKE BACK.

185
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:46,629
WE CANNOT HELP HER
UNLESS WE STOP HER.

186
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,724
FINE.

187
00:09:58,728 --> 00:09:59,947
IF I WERE BATMAN,

188
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,820
WHERE WOULD I STASH POISON IVY?

189
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:05,406
OUR BEST BET IS THAT
BRUCE WROTE ABOUT PAM ISLEY

190
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,432
IN HIS JOURNALS,
WHICH ARE IN THE BATCAVE HERE,

191
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:09,652
BUT MARQUIS'
STATE-OF-THE-ART INTERIOR

192
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:10,716
AND EXTERIOR CAMERAS MEANS

193
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,090
NO ROOF, BALCONY,
OR GARAGE ACCESS.

194
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,004
CAN YOU HACK INTO THE FEED
AND BUY ME SOME TIME?

195
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:16,441
- NOT WITH DIALUP.
- MANPOWER?

196
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,008
THERE'S 5 SECURITY
GUARDS PER FLOOR.

197
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,638
- DIGITAL UPGRADES?
- ACCORDING TO OUR FORMER STAFF,

198
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:22,534
EVERY EXECUTIVE ELEVATOR
REQUIRES A THUMB SCAN,

199
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:24,121
AND HIS OFFICE IS LOCKED
WITH A RETINAL SCAN.

200
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:25,825
GUYS, WE'RE NOT
GETTING INTO THIS BUILDING.

201
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:30,281
WHY IS MARQUIS CALLING ME?
AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIS?

202
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,066
WHAT THE HELL DOES HE WANT?

203
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:35,243
GUESS I'M ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

204
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:38,594
I'M SORRY. I WAS
A DETECTIVE FOR 8 YEARS,

205
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,727
AND I'M JUST LEARNING NOW
THAT...

206
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,556
BRUCE WAYNE WAS... BATMAN?

207
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,081
WHAT UP, SIS?
QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU.

208
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:48,909
IS THIS THING LEGIT?

209
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:49,866
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I CAN HAWK IT FOR,

210
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,042
A BUCK 50, TWO?

211
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,131
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MARQUIS?

212
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,873
I'M REDECORATING MY OFFICE.

213
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,329
YOU DO KNOW YOU HAD
A CHESS SET, RIGHT?

214
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,355
YOU SHOULD BE IN JAIL.

215
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:01,878
OH! SAMESIES, SIS.

216
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,488
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
HAD ME KIDNAPPED?

217
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,708
THAT'S ILLEGAL! TSK, TSK, TSK.

218
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,928
YOU WANT TO CALL IT SIXES
AND MOVE ON?

219
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:09,712
YOU NEED HELP.
YOU NEED A DOCTOR.

220
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,453
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

221
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,716
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
- SIR.

222
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,911
THE PLANNER'S UPSTAIRS
READY TO TAKE YOU

223
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,303
THROUGH THE STAGING
FOR THE PARTY TONIGHT,

224
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,478
AND YOUR MASK IS HERE
FOR A FITTING.

225
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,417
YEAH. TWO SECONDS.

226
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,027
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
YOU WERE CALLING ME

227
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,290
A MENTAL CASE.

228
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,292
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE CALLED ME

229
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:25,356
IF A TINY PART OF YOU WASN'T
REACHING OUT FOR HELP.

230
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,599
JUST LIKE THERE'S
A TINY PART OF YOU

231
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:28,339
THAT LOVES ME, RIGHT,
OR ELSE YOU WOULD HAVE HAD

232
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,079
MY ASS THROWN IN ARKHAM,

233
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:30,907
AND BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME,

234
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:33,344
YOU TRIED TO TURN ME
INTO AN ICE CUBE.

235
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,738
ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED TO
SAY THANK YOU.

236
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:39,394
THE COLD,
THE NEAR DEATH OF IT ALL,

237
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:41,004
GOT TO SAY,
IT AWOKE SOMETHING IN ME

238
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:44,181
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER FELT
THIS ALIVE.

239
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:47,010
MARQUIS JET IS COMING
FOR YOU, GOTHAM!

240
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,387
YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM ME SOON.

241
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:03,113
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

242
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:05,725
I THINK MARQUIS IS THROWING
A PARTY AT WAYNE TONIGHT,

243
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:06,856
AND WE'RE GONNA CRASH IT.

244
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,460
SO WE SHOULD RUN
OUR IDENTITIES. GO.

245
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,679
AHEM. HELLO. I'M SPENCER GLAD,

246
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:50,291
FORMER OLYMPIC ATHLETE,
RUMORED TO BE

247
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,467
THE NEXT OWNER
OF THE GOTHAM KNIGHTS.

248
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,296
I'LL HIT YOU UP
FOR FLOOR SEATS, SPENCE.

249
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,601
THE NAME'S CECELIA LANGLEY,

250
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,517
HEIRESS TO A WHISKEY FORTUNE
AND WORLD TRAVELER.

251
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:04,827
PENELOPE DEVEREAUX,
WHO FOR SOME REASON

252
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,482
RUNS A BOARD GAME EMPIRE?

253
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:08,439
- HONESTLY, DREAM JOB.
- JUST GONNA SAY IT.

254
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:10,137
MY GIRL SOUNDS HOT.

255
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,443
ALSO, HOW ARE WE NOT GONNA
RUN INTO THESE PEOPLE TONIGHT?

256
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,837
YEAH. I SENT SOME E-MAILS.
THEY THINK THEY'RE UNINVITED,

257
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,492
AND, YES, SHE IS.

258
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,165
I FITTED YOUR MASK
WITH OCULAR MESH SCANNERS

259
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,800
FROM THE BATSUIT.

260
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,323
BE CAREFUL. SOPHIE, YOURS IS

261
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,498
FROM THE DOLLAR STORE.

262
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,630
- GO NUTS.
- OK. SO WE GET IN,

263
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:26,825
GET PAST SECURITY,
GET TO THE BATCAVE,

264
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,591
FIND BRUCE'S JOURNALS,
AND FIND PAM.

265
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,901
OH, AND, PENELOPE,
YOU'RE FRENCH.

266
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:35,944
WAIT. WHAT?

267
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:55,008
8 OF CLUBS? WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

268
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,966
HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE LONG
GONE BEFORE IT MATTERS.

269
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,690
MARQUIS, ON P.A.:
WHO WANTS TO PLAY A GAME?

270
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:10,284
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE IN LIFE
THAN A FAKE SMILE.

271
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,424
A COUPLE DAYS AGO, I SAT DOWN

272
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:22,687
AT THE TABLE
OF MY BRAND-NEW BOARD ROOM,

273
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:25,299
SURROUNDED BY MEN AND WOMEN
WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

274
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:26,604
MY SOLDIERS,

275
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:30,260
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT
I WASN'T THE RIGHT MAN

276
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,740
TO LEAD WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

277
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,350
ON YOUR RIGHT.

278
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:34,874
OH, OH, MAN. OH. I'M SO SORRY.

279
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,354
HI. I'LL TAKE THIS FOR YOU.

280
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:38,418
BUT IT WAS THE WAY
THAT THEY SAID IT.

281
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:39,922
NO CRACK OR ANYTHING.
THAT'S CRAZY.

282
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:44,057
SO CONDESCENDING,
LIKE THEY WERE MAD ABOUT IT,

283
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,188
LIKE THIS.

284
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,584
SO I FIRED THEIR ASSES!

285
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,591
EACH OF YOU HAS PROVEN
TO BE OF SAVAGE MIND.

286
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:59,942
THAT'S WHO I WANT
AT MY WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

287
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,083
JACK OF HEARTS.

288
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,234
DID WE JUST CRASH A DERANGED
GROUP JOB INTERVIEW?

289
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:12,955
I'M AFRAID SO.

290
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,049
HANDS ON THE TABLE,
JACK OF HEARTS.

291
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:23,661
TRUE OR FALSE...

292
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:26,273
WHEN WE CLIMB TO THE TOP,

293
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,014
WE GOT TO BE WILLING
TO GET A LITTLE CRAZY.

294
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:29,972
TRUE.

295
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,933
HOW'S THIS? CLOSE ENOUGH?

296
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,736
NO. WE NEED A FULL RETINAL
MAP TO FOOL THE SCANNERS.

297
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,414
YOU NEED TO BE A LOT CLOSER.

298
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,522
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT

299
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,635
WHILE HE'S PLAYING
GAME SHOW HOST?

300
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:41,786
LOOK. ALL I KNOW IS
I SWITCHED THE SIM CARD

301
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,420
ON HIS ASSISTANT'S TABLET,
AND NOW I HAVE

302
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:44,484
FULL ACCESS
TO TOWER SECURITY CAMS.

303
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:47,337
OK. AHEM.
IT'S NOT A COMPETITION.

304
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:52,603
YEAH. SURE THING,
BUT, UH, SOPHIE JUST GOT

305
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:55,041
MARQUIS' THUMBPRINT, SO KIND
OF JUST WAITING ON YOU HERE.

306
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:58,740
COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

307
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:01,569
THE SICK AMONG US DESERVE OUR...

308
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,702
PITY?

309
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:08,357
HA HA HA!

310
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:15,235
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

311
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,064
THE ANSWER WE WERE
LOOKING FOR WAS FEAR.

312
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:20,980
TOUGH LUCK.

313
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,023
WHO'S NEXT?

314
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,116
COME ON. DON'T BE SHY.

315
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,553
LOOK. I PROMISE THIS IS
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME.

316
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,992
3 OF DIAMONDS.

317
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,961
OUI. C'EST MOI.

318
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,095
OH. MISS PENELOPE DEVEREAUX

319
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:51,749
I PRESUME.

320
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:52,968
OK. HERE WE GO.

321
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,970
THE ONLY PARISIAN
ON MY GUEST LIST.

322
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,494
YOU CREATED THE GAME
3 MURDERS AT THE BOWERY.

323
00:16:57,538 --> 00:17:02,064
MAY I SAY YOUR WORK IS MOST...

324
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:02,586
THOUGHTFULLY DERANGED.

325
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,632
MERCI.

326
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:08,157
JUST... JUST A FEW MORE SECONDS.

327
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:09,115
TRUE OR FALSE...

328
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:11,639
AN ARTIST ALWAYS PUTS HERSELF,

329
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:15,077
NO MATTER HOW DARK,
INTO HER WORK.

330
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:16,339
OUI.

331
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:22,084
WHENEVER WE REVEAL
OUR DARKNESS INTO THE LIGHT.

332
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:22,650
WE ARE NO LONGER SCARED.

333
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:24,086
NON.

334
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,262
HEH.

335
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:29,135
FINISH THIS SENTENCE.

336
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,311
A MOTHER'S LOVE IS...

337
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:32,573
SCAN COMPLETE. GOOD TO GO.

338
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:37,404
EH, NOT MY PROBLEM.

339
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,248
YOU KNOW, IF MY
THERAPIST WERE HERE,

340
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,424
SHE'D SAY IT'S NEVER A GOOD IDEA

341
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:59,643
TO HUNT A DESICCATED BODY
WHILE ANGRY.

342
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,186
JUST TELL ME WHY SHE WANTS
TO BE HERE ALL OF A SUDDEN.

343
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,343
IT'S NOT ALL OF A SUDDEN.

344
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:04,494
WE WERE PLANNING TO SPEND
OUR ENTIRE LIVES TOGETHER.

345
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,998
BRUCE MENTIONED
ANYTHING ABOUT PAM,

346
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:10,089
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
I'LL UNDERSTAND IT.

347
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,178
JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
KISS AND MAKE UP WITH HER

348
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:13,048
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GOOD.

349
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,571
I GET WHY YOU'RE PISSED,

350
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,617
BUT REMEMBER SOMETHING.

351
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,228
POISON IVY COST ME
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

352
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:20,272
TRYING TO HELP.

353
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,712
I'LL TAKE YOUR HELP.

354
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,931
THEN I WANT MY NAME...

355
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,325
BATWOMAN'S NAME...
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

356
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:31,545
WE'VE PRETTY MUCH CLEANED
UP EVERYTHING ON YOUR LIST.

357
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,677
THAT'S A FUN WAY OF SAYING
THE JOKER'S JOY BUZZER'S

358
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:34,591
STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR.

359
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:36,332
OK. WE NEED ALICE TO FIND IT.

360
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,118
WAIT. ALICE WAS YOUR JOB, RIGHT?

361
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,486
AND YOU WERE HOOKING UP
WITH HER AT HER PLACE,

362
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,991
WHICH... PHEW... I HOPE
IT'S NICER THAN HER OFFICE.

363
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:43,731
MY PLACE IS RENT CONTROLLED.

364
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:46,821
WHO CARES IF IT'S NICE?

365
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:47,972
REALLY THOUGHT WAYNE TOWER
WAS TALL ENOUGH

366
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,396
FOR US TO GET
TO HANDSHAKES, LADIES.

367
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,758
HI. HEY. I THOUGHT I TOLD
YOU TO LOCK THE DOOR.

368
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:14,543
EHH.

369
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,636
UHH!

370
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:27,596
WE'RE THE CLEANING LADIES.

371
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,130
LET'S GO.

372
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:58,457
SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.

373
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,772
CAN YOU FACE THE OTHER WAY?

374
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:11,340
WE KIND OF GOT A HIDDEN
ENTRY SITUATION GOING HERE.

375
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:47,158
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

376
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,645
GUYS, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU FIGURED OUT

377
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,125
WHERE POISON IVY'S BURIED.

378
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,082
- WE JUST GOT TO THE JOURNALS.
- BE QUICK ABOUT IT

379
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,780
BECAUSE MARY JUST GOT HERE.

380
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:02,565
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

381
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,306
MARY CAME HOME.
IS SHE LOOKING FOR US?

382
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,631
UH, JUST JUDGING
A BOOK BY ITS COVER HERE,

383
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:06,806
BUT I THINK IT'S MORE
LIKELY THAT SHE'S LOOKING

384
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,788
FOR FREAK FERTILIZER.

385
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:10,356
ANY SIGN OF ALICE WITH HER?

386
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:11,357
NO, NOT YET, BUT I'LL KEEP
MY EYE ON THE SECURITY CAMS.

387
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,750
DON'T LET HER
LEAVE THIS BUILDING.

388
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:14,490
GREAT. I MEAN, SHE'S
BEEN SO COOPERATIVE LATELY,

389
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,275
I SEE NO PROBLEMS THERE.

390
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,364
OK. CALL IF YOU NEED BACKUP.

391
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:19,558
IF MARY'S HERE,
IT'S FOR A REASON,

392
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,933
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU
IT'S NOT TO DANCE.

393
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,108
LET'S JUST GET TO THESE.

394
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,858
OK. I PROMISE I JUST
WANT TO TALK.

395
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:37,165
OK. I'LL JUST GRAB
A NUMBER AND STAY RIGHT HERE.

396
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:42,692
MARY HAMILTON.

397
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,694
WELL, WELL. I SHOULD PROBABLY

398
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:47,741
FIRE MY PUBLICIST,
MARY HAMILTON,

399
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:51,397
BECAUSE YOU SHOULD KNOW YOUR
FRIENDS NO LONGER LIVE HERE.

400
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,095
WELL, I'M NO PR REP,
BUT IF SHE'S THE ONE

401
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:56,445
WHO CAME UP WITH YOUR
DECK OF CARDS THEME,

402
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,289
IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER.

403
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,929
HEH. I'M NOT FEELING THE
VIBES YOU'RE PUTTING OUT,

404
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:05,411
AND THAT'S A SHAME
BECAUSE YOU...

405
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:08,370
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'D
BE A LOT OF FUN.

406
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:12,331
DON'T GIVE UP ON ME
SO FAST, MR. C-E-BRO.

407
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,551
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD THE REASON
I CAME ALL THIS WAY TO FIND YOU.

408
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:18,206
DANCE?

409
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,824
OK. OK. OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

410
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:30,000
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

411
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,570
NEW PLAN. BRUCE ARCHIVED
THESE CHRONOLOGICALLY,

412
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:38,095
SO LET'S START THERE.

413
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:38,879
WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU
CONTACTED BATMAN FOR HELP?

414
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:39,488
IT WAS EARLY JUNE 2011.

415
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:41,229
OK.

416
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,932
DOES ANY OF THIS LOOK FAMILIAR?

417
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:52,980
THIS. THIS IS
THE GOTHAM CITY DAM.

418
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:54,610
BRUCE WOULDN'T HAVE DESICCATED
PAM AROUND THAT MUCH WATER.

419
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:57,811
HE DIDN'T. HE NEEDED TO
STOP HER FROM DESTROYING IT.

420
00:22:57,854 --> 00:22:59,116
THE DAM WAS HER NEXT TARGET.

421
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,902
OK, OK. I'M... I'M SORRY.

422
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:04,339
WHY DID YOU LOVE THIS WOMAN?

423
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,211
BECAUSE THROUGH IT ALL
I KNEW IT REALLY WASN'T HER.

424
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:11,302
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MARY,
WHAT HAPPENED TO PAM

425
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:12,347
WASN'T A FAIR FIGHT.

426
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:28,407
I APPRECIATE THE SYMBOLISM,

427
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,279
BUT TECHNICALLY,
YOU JUST KILLED A TULIP.

428
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:32,236
YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

429
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,978
YES, I AM.

430
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:37,416
THE QUESTION IS DO I PACK

431
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:41,594
ONE TOOTHBRUSH OR TWO?

432
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:42,832
GUYS AT THE PRECINCT
MENTIONED SOMETHING

433
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:46,816
ABOUT A BREAK-IN AT
GOTHAM DAM LAST NIGHT.

434
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,740
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT, WOULD YOU?

435
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:52,561
I HAVEN'T BEEN
STUDYING MY ASS OFF

436
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:56,043
FOR MY DETECTIVE'S EXAM
FOR NOTHING.

437
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:57,406
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
TO DO THERE?

438
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,982
YOU WANT THE TRUTH SO YOU
HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH ME

439
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:04,486
OR A LIE SO WE CAN
STAY TOGETHER?

440
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,923
DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T PUT THIS ON ME.

441
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:09,709
WHY NOT? YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

442
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:12,668
I WANT TO SAVE GOTHAM
FROM BECOMING

443
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:14,254
A TOXIC WASTE DUMP, AND
I'D LIKE YOU TO SUPPORT ME

444
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:15,410
WHILE I DO IT,

445
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,977
SO...

446
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,894
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

447
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,856
FOR YOU TO CHOOSE ONE...

448
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,554
YOUR CAUSE, FLOODING THE CITY,

449
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:32,688
WIPING FULL NEIGHBORHOODS
OFF THE MAP, OR ME.

450
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,699
ABOVE ALL ELSE, I WANT YOU.

451
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:48,835
BUT I NEED YOU TO TRUST THAT
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

452
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,640
WHAT IS THIS FOR?

453
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,163
FORGIVENESS.

454
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:20,169
OHH!

455
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:43,628
YOU THINK OF SOMETHING?

456
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:48,503
YOU GOOD?

457
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,465
HEY. GOT SOMETHING.

458
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,642
BRUCE WROTE THAT POISON
IVY WOULD HAVE TO BE KEPT

459
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:57,947
WHERE NO ONE WOULD LOOK FOR HER

460
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,621
BUT SOMEWHERE HE COULD
GET TO HER IF HE NEEDED.

461
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:02,038
SO CLOSE. HE WOULDN'T
HAVE BURIED HER ANYWHERE

462
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:03,431
NEAR THEIR USUAL HOT SPOTS...

463
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:06,303
DOCKS, SHIPYARDS, BACK ALLEYS.

464
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,454
NO. IT'D HAVE TO BE
DARK AND DRY,

465
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:08,630
NO WATER, NO LIGHT,
NO OTHER PLANT LIFE.

466
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,438
WATER WAS HIS BIGGEST CONCERN.

467
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:13,093
A SINGLE DROP COULD BE
ENOUGH TO REANIMATE HER.

468
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:14,703
GOTHAM CITY IS A DAMN ISLAND,

469
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:17,924
WHERE IT RAINS 300 DAYS A YEAR.

470
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:19,292
ARE YOU SURE HE DIDN'T
MAKE A DEAL WITH GCPD

471
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:20,946
FOR SOME KIND OF SPECIAL
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY?

472
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,625
WELL, SHE'S NOT AT BLACKGATE,

473
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:24,863
AND I CHECKED THE OFF-BOOKS
WING AT ARKHAM, TOO.

474
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:26,567
THERE HAS TO BE AN ANSWER
WE'RE NOT SEEING.

475
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:34,462
OH, MY GOD.

476
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
WHAT IF SHE'S HERE?

477
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,580
YOU SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE
IN SERVICE

478
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,974
TO LOGIC AND FORENSIC EVIDENCE,

479
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:10,672
AND THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT LOVE DOES.

480
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,370
IT MAKES YOU WANT TO SAY
THINGS LIKE,

481
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:15,677
"I KNOW SHE'S DOWN HERE.

482
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,852
I CAN FEEL HER."

483
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:23,467
IF SHE'S IN THERE, ARE YOU SURE

484
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:26,427
YOU WANT TO SEE HER LIKE THIS?

485
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,691
RYAN AND I CAN HANDLE IT.

486
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:33,216
THANKS, BUT I OWE IT TO HER
NOT TO RUN AWAY AND HIDE.

487
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,218
THIS HAS THE SCHEMATICS
FOR THE TUNNEL SYSTEM

488
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:37,220
BELOW THE BATCAVE.

489
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:38,807
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE
GONNA END UP,

490
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:41,529
SO MAKE SURE WE FIND
OUR WAY BACK.

491
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:45,054
HOW FAR DOWN DOES THIS GO?

492
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:46,336
EVEN CLOSER TO HELL
THAN YOUR OFFICE.

493
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
OK. I NEED TOTAL QUIET.

494
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:58,827
SORRY, GUYS. DAMN FRAUD
ALERT ON MY CREDIT CARD.

495
00:27:58,851 --> 00:28:01,331
Y... SILENCING.

496
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:22,831
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING.

497
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,006
TRYING TO ISOLATE IT.

498
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:34,060
OK. I'M LOCKED IN.

499
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:37,019
I CAN HEAR IT CLEAR ENOUGH
TO TRACK THE SOURCE.

500
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:38,804
HEAR WHAT?

501
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:42,024
- PAM'S HEARTBEAT.
- OH, MY GOD.

502
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:43,243
- YOU HAVE THE DEVICE?
- YEAH.

503
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:45,549
THEN WE NEED TO MOVE.
WHATEVER MARY'S UP TO,

504
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:47,508
SHE DOESN'T STAY
IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG.

505
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:48,901
LUKE, WE THINK PAM'S SOMEWHERE

506
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,164
IN THE LOWER TUNNELS.

507
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,557
AH. THAT IS ACTUALLY BRILLIANT.

508
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:54,341
A LOT OF SOLID ROCK DOWN THERE,

509
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:55,516
SO WE MIGHT LOSE CONTACT.

510
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,605
KEEP MARY THERE.
HELP IS ON THE WAY.

511
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:58,648
LET'S GO.

512
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:10,096
SO I KEEP WONDERING TWO THINGS.

513
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:13,795
WHY ARE YOU HERE,
AND WHERE'S WILDER?

514
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,929
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY THINKING
ABOUT YOUR SISTER RIGHT NOW?

515
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:21,281
SO YOU EXPECT ME TO THINK THAT
I COULD STEAL HER COMPANY...

516
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:23,500
AND SHE'S JUST COOL WITH IT?

517
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:25,415
HMM. IT'S HONESTLY
KIND OF ANNOYING

518
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:28,679
HOW MUCH CLINGINESS RUNS
IN YOUR FAMILY.

519
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:31,334
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY RYAN
ISN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU?

520
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:33,989
IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S TOO
OBSESSED WITH FIXING ME.

521
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,560
YOU DON'T LOOK BROKEN TO ME.

522
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:41,083
LOOK.

523
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:43,172
LONG STORY SHORT,

524
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,653
I JUST WANT TO MOVE ON
WITH MY LIFE

525
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:46,804
WITH THE ONE PERSON LEFT
WHO UNDERSTANDS ME.

526
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:49,091
UNH.

527
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,702
BUT THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF

528
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:55,837
THIS MARQUIS GUY HAS
A LOT OF WEIRD BAGGAGE.

529
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:59,449
MAYBE HE WANTS TO TAKE
REVENGE ON RYAN ON MY BEHALF.

530
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:00,581
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

531
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:18,294
OOP. WELL, LOOK
WHO STOPPED TALKING.

532
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:22,429
UM, A LITTLE BONUS FOR YOU.

533
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:27,651
IT MIGHT HELP OPEN UP SOME
DOORS FOR YOU IN THE FUTURE.

534
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:28,827
HEH HEH HEH.

535
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,229
RYAN, ARE WE HOT OR COLD?

536
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:42,841
TELL ME WE'RE SCALDING

537
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,886
BECAUSE WE'RE ALMOST
AT THE END OF THE MAP.

538
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,330
WELL, IT'S GETTING LOUDER. I
JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FURTHER.

539
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,890
- AGH!
- BATWOMAN...

540
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,370
- MARY AND MARQUIS...
- LUKE?

541
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:53,503
LUKE, YOU COPY? DAMN.

542
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:54,916
OK. THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH MARY UPSTAIRS.

543
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,636
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

544
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,679
GUYS!

545
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:29,626
TELL ME SHE HAD
A CHARMING PERSONALITY.

546
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,758
THAT'S THE DESICCATION.

547
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,214
THE SERUM LEECHES WATER
FROM THE CELLS.

548
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:33,238
INCLUDES SKIN AND TISSUE.

549
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,766
YOU WANT TO DO THIS TO MARY?

550
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,222
I'M TRYING TO PREVENT
A POISON IVY OUTBREAK

551
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:42,050
FROM WIPING OUT GOTHAM'S
BEST AND BRIGHTEST UPSTAIRS.

552
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:45,947
LOOK, RYAN. I WAS YOU ONCE.

553
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:48,341
I WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT THERE
WAS SOME MAGICAL SOLUTION

554
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:49,255
WHERE I SAVED
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE

555
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:51,344
WITHOUT HER HATING ME FOREVER.

556
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:53,041
THERE ISN'T.
MARY IS AT THE PARTY.

557
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:55,391
THE SERUM IS HERE.

558
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:57,305
IT'S TIME TO STEP UP.

559
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,720
ALL RIGHT. GOT IT.

560
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:21,263
HEY, LUKE. IF YOU CAN
HEAR ME, I'M HEADED UP.

561
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:22,438
- WE'RE COMING WITH YOU.
- STAY AND MAKE SURE

562
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:24,464
PAM DOESN'T WAKE UP.

563
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:25,291
I'LL CHECK IN ONCE MARY'S DOWN.

564
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:28,511
REMEMBER, NO WATER BREAKS,

565
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:30,275
AND IF YOU SO MUCH AS
HAVE TO SNEEZE, DON'T.

566
00:32:35,127 --> 00:32:37,129
JUST IN CASE.

567
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,243
HEY. BATWOMAN, IF YOU COPY,
I LOST EYES ON MARY.

568
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:48,531
WHERE ARE YOU?

569
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:50,422
- DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE COMING.
- GET THE HELL OFF ME, MAN.

570
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:52,076
OH, I DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD BE TALKING LIKE THAT.

571
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,251
YOU'RE NOT WEARING
THE RIGHT COSTUME.

572
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:55,495
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

573
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:56,452
SEE, I JUST WONDER
WHERE YOU KEEP IT.

574
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:58,367
PLUG IT IN LIKE A TESLA CHARGER?

575
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,413
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

576
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:08,456
BUT I THINK YOU DO, BATWING.

577
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:12,729
SHE'D FORGIVE YOU.

578
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:15,906
YOU HAVE NO CLUE HOW MUCH
OF A FIGHTER SHE WAS.

579
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,171
I'M TALKING ABOUT PAM,

580
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:19,910
THE WOMAN YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH,

581
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:22,304
NOT POISON IVY.

582
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:31,270
FOR THE RECORD,
I TAKE HALF THE BLAME

583
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:34,099
FOR ALICE GOING FREE.

584
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:35,926
NOT THE WISEST MOVE ON MY PART.

585
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,320
WE'LL FIND HER. SHE'LL
SCREW UP EVENTUALLY,

586
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:40,061
PING A TRAFFIC CAM, ROB A BANK.

587
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:43,673
ALICE? MORE LIKE HOLD UP
A DOUGHNUT SHOP.

588
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,376
OH, MY GOD. THE FRAUD ALERT.

589
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:53,398
WHOEVER STOLE MY CARD,
THEY PURCHASED

590
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:55,859
A 3-TIER STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE

591
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:56,923
AND A GRAPE SODA,
THEN HAD IT SENT

592
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:58,949
TO HER HOTEL ROOM.

593
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:00,168
AND YOU THINK IT WAS ALICE?

594
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:02,692
KNOWING HER, SHE WON'T
BE THERE MUCH LONGER.

595
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:04,781
I NEED TO GET HER BACK.
ARE YOU GOOD HERE?

596
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:06,745
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE'S REANIMATING.
I'LL BE FINE.

597
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:10,525
BE CAREFUL.

598
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,885
SORRY, MA'AM. ELEVATORS
ARE TEMPORARILY DOWN.

599
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,974
ALL OF THEM? WHY?

600
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:27,195
JUST SOME HICCUP WITH THE
BUILDING COMPUTER SYSTEM.

601
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,936
WE'LL GET YOU
ON YOUR WAY SHORTLY.

602
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:32,113
OH, RYAN, WHEN WILL YOU GIVE UP?

603
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:33,837
THE STAIRS ARE BETTER
FOR MY CALVES ANYWAY.

604
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:43,429
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

605
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:45,474
CAKE?

606
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:48,042
I BELIEVE YOU GET 5% CASH BACK.

607
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,435
- YOU LURED ME HERE?
- LURED YOU?

608
00:34:49,478 --> 00:34:51,828
LET'S NOT GET KINKY.

609
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:52,992
ALICE, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

610
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,531
I MADE A JUICY DISCOVERY,

611
00:34:58,574 --> 00:34:59,769
AND I'VE BEEN DYING TO TELL YOU,

612
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:01,292
BUT YOU'VE BEEN SO HARD
TO GET ALONE LATELY.

613
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:02,337
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO OUR FRIENDSHIP.

614
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:05,146
WE DON'T HAVE ONE, FOR STARTERS.

615
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,368
BESIDES THE POINT.
YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND

616
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:12,153
TO HOUSE ME ON THAT PRISON
COT YOU CALL A PULL-OUT COUCH.

617
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,547
I JUST WANTED TO RETURN
THE FAVOR.

618
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,767
YOUR LITTLE LOVER
HAS BEEN PLAYING US.

619
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:18,942
- RENEE?
- SURE,

620
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:20,224
OR WHATEVER YOU CALL HER
UNDER THE SHEETS.

621
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:24,383
SINCE WHEN DO YOU DO ME FAVORS?

622
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:26,689
BECAUSE RE-NAY-NAY IS A LIAR,

623
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:29,388
AND SHE NEEDS TO PAY
FOR BEING A BAD ONE.

624
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:30,452
SAYS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST LIAR.

625
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:33,566
YOU KNOW, RENEE'S HUGE MISTAKE

626
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,045
WAS LEAVING ME ALONE
IN HER OFFICE.

627
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:38,136
DID SHE NOT THINK I WOULD
SNOOP EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY?

628
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,312
LEFT CABINET,
SECOND DRAWER DOWN.

629
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:41,356
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

630
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:55,787
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU, MARY.

631
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:02,464
THERE'S ANOTHER PROMISE BROKEN.

632
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:07,252
OH! WHAT IS THAT?
DO YOU EVEN KNOW?

633
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:08,644
BATMAN MADE IT
TO STOP POISON IVY.

634
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:11,517
WHEN, A DECADE AGO? DO YOU
EVEN KNOW THE HALF-LIFE

635
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,301
OF ITS CHEMICAL COMPOUND?

636
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,912
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
THAT'LL DO TO ME, DO YOU?

637
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:18,132
YOU GAVE ME NO CHOICE.

638
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,743
HEY, BATWOMAN. HOLD UP.

639
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:22,919
YOU READY FOR ME
TO BLOW YOUR MIND?

640
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:26,488
HOW ABOUT WE KILL YOUR
TWO LITTLE SIDEKICKS

641
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:27,707
AT THE SAME TIME, HMM?

642
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,119
A LITTLE BROTHER-SISTER
BONDING ACTION?

643
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:30,143
COME ON!

644
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:38,631
IT WAS ME. I TOLD HIM

645
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:39,999
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT
US ALL THROUGH THAT

646
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,566
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT" PHASE.

647
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,550
MARY... HOW COULD YOU?

648
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:47,379
YOU GAVE ME NO CHOICE.

649
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:49,119
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHY I WAS THE KID

650
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:51,296
THAT GOT CHOSE
ON THAT BUS THAT DAY.

651
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:55,952
A COUPLE DOZEN KIDS, SO WHY
WAS I THE ONE THAT GOT BUZZED?

652
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:58,955
EVERYONE SAYS
THE WORLD'S GONE MAD,

653
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:00,566
BUT I GET IT.

654
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:04,134
BATMAN HAD THE JOKER,

655
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:08,443
AND, BATWOMAN, YOU GOT ME.

656
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:09,401
TRUE OR FALSE, SIS...

657
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:12,447
YOU GOTTA TRUST DESTINY.

658
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:15,755
FALSE. WE MAKE
OUR OWN DESTINIES.

659
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:17,147
YOU WISH.

660
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:18,845
UNH!

661
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,910
I'VE BEEN IN THE BEDROOM TRYING

662
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:43,130
TO FINAGLE MY WAY
OUT OF SOPHIE'S HANDCUFFS,

663
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:45,175
AND YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE
DRINKING ALL THE DOM?

664
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:52,705
RYAN HAD ME BEAT.

665
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:54,335
SHE WAS ABOUT TO INJECT
ME WITH SOMETHING,

666
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,099
AND THEN SHE HESITATED.

667
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:59,451
WHATEVER SHE WAS ABOUT
TO DO TO ME SCARED HER.

668
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:02,454
DON'T TELL YOU'RE GETTING
THE CONSCIENCE TINGLES.

669
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:05,413
BEFORE I EVEN KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

670
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:08,373
SHE USED THE SYRINGE ON MARQUIS.

671
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:11,419
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS
TO SAVE LUKE

672
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:13,595
OR PROTECT HER SECRET.

673
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:22,387
BUT ALL I KNOW IS
IN THAT MOMENT,

674
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,999
I WAS THE LEAST OF HER PROBLEMS.

675
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,827
SHE STILL UNDERESTIMATES YOU.

676
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:33,789
I KNOW IT'S SILLY,
BUT A PART OF ME

677
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,836
JUST WANTED HER TO
SEE ME AS POWERFUL.

678
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:43,364
DO YOU KNOW ALL THOSE LOONEY
TUNE DELUSIONS I'VE BEEN HAVING,

679
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:46,498
POSTCARDS FROM DAD,
IMAGINARY FRIENDS,

680
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,369
WALKING IN ON SOPHIE
IN THE SHOWER?

681
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:51,851
THAT LAST ONE HAPPENED.

682
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:53,809
OH.

683
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:58,074
ANYWAY, SINCE YOUR WHOLE
POISON MARY METAMORPHOSIS,

684
00:38:58,118 --> 00:39:01,121
I HAVE YET TO HAVE
A SINGLE DELUSIONAL THOUGHT,

685
00:39:01,164 --> 00:39:03,166
WHICH MEANS BABY-SITTING
YOU, MY DEAR,

686
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,039
HAS MADE ME LESS
OF A CRAZY PERSON,

687
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:08,998
AND IF THAT'S NOT POWERFUL,

688
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,131
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

689
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:25,014
I KNOW YOU CAN'T HEAR ME.

690
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:26,058
I KNOW YOU HATE ME...

691
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:32,761
BUT I AM SORRY.

692
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:33,956
I'VE BEEN SORRY
EVERY DAY I WAKE UP

693
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,198
TO A BADGE AND NOT TO YOU.

694
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:50,475
OH, MY GOD.

695
00:39:57,046 --> 00:40:02,269
PAM.

696
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:05,577
PAM, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

697
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,451
PAM?

698
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:50,142
OH, MY GOD.

699
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,756
DESICCATION IS NOT PRETTY.

700
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,498
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
HOOK HIM UP TO FLUIDS?

701
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:59,457
NOT UNLESS YOU WANT HIM
TO WAKE UP.

702
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,502
HE KNOWS WHO WE ARE.
THE SECOND HE WAKES UP,

703
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:02,547
THE WHOLE WORLD WILL, TOO.

704
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,870
THAT'S A BIG, FAT IF
HE WAKES UP.

705
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,211
JADA JET, THIS IS BATWOMAN.

706
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:16,928
I HAVE YOUR SON.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A WAY

707
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:19,259
TO FIX HIS BRAIN,
I SUGGEST YOU FIND IT QUICK.

708
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:25,918
SOPHIE, HOW DO YOU HAVE
RECEPTION IN THE TUNNELS?

709
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:27,635
I'M NOT IN THE TUNNELS,
BUT YOU NEED TO GET THERE ASAP.

710
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:30,183
SOPHIE, WHERE'S RENEE?

711
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,377
YOU KNOW WHY YOU AND ALICE
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

712
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,665
TO CROSS THE JOY BUZZER
OFF HER LIST?

713
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,537
RENEE HAS HAD IT
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

714
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:37,843
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE HAD IT?

715
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:41,107
I MEAN, SHE WAS NEVER
GONNA LET ALICE FREE.

716
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:46,112
SHE LIED, RYAN,
TO ALICE, TO YOU, TO ME.

717
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:47,393
SHE WAS HOLDING IT
OVER YOUR HEADS

718
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,419
TILL ONE OF YOU FOUND
WHAT SHE WANTED...

719
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:52,901
HER SOUL MATE PAMELA ISLEY.

720
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:22,017
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
