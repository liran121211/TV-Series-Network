1
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:06,423
I just want to find my friends.

2
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:08,195
I found Kennedy Chapman.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,101
She's going to tell me
where everyone's hiding.

4
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:13,860
I know you think I'm paranoid,
but they have found us.

5
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:15,735
There's no proof that they've found us.

6
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:17,333
So where in the fuck is Logan?

7
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:18,817
Where's Mason? Where's Garrett?

8
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:21,047
They're all fucking gone, Ryder.

9
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:23,087
How are you guys feeling?

10
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:27,198
- Does Garrett work here?
- Yeah, Garrett, that's my guy.

11
00:00:27,223 --> 00:00:28,512
I know Garrett.

12
00:00:28,537 --> 00:00:30,526
It'd be great if you could help me.

13
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:33,672
Where have you been? You
can't just run away like that.

14
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:38,254
I was looking for
Garrett. Just doing my job.

15
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:57,222
- How is she?
- Under control.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,317
Keep me posted.

17
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,361
How are you guys feeling?

18
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,928
Is there anything I can do
to make you more comfortable?

19
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:08,381
I don't know if I can help you.

20
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:10,168
I mean, the main reason I'm here

21
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:12,998
is you want me to lead you
to everyone else, right?

22
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,248
That's your big plan?

23
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:17,482
Find everyone and bring them back?

24
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,009
Some more than others, yes.

25
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:22,728
What are you afraid of?

26
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:24,128
What are you so fucking afraid of?

27
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:25,427
What am I afraid of?

28
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,154
I'm not afraid of anything.

29
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:28,663
I'm concerned about what
happened to you guys.

30
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,390
I'm just trying to help.

31
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,965
Well, what are you gonna
do if you find everybody?

32
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:35,037
Hunt them down? Kidnap them?

33
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,949
I mean, what the fuck are you doing?

34
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:42,423
What happened to you guys was a mistake.

35
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:45,308
So when you ask me what I'm
going to do to the others

36
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,323
after you help me find them,

37
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:49,662
I don't know what you're asking.

38
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,912
I'm going to give them
back what Logan took away.

39
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,470
- And what's that?
- Their freedom.

40
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:04,549
Have I mistreated you at all?

41
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:07,967
Have you been mistreated at
all since you've been here?

42
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,587
Because if you feel you have...

43
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,540
then you can leave,
the door's right there.

44
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,215
I won't stop you.

45
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,976
Yeah, we can go whenever, right?

46
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,758
Agatha. Agatha!

47
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,776
Agatha, wake up.

48
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:42,498
Who did this to you?

49
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:43,898
Who did this to you, Agatha?

50
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:46,043
Did you go out looking for people again?

51
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,135
It's them. They were here.

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,200
Babe, who?

53
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:52,605
- They're looking for you.
- Who?

54
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,002
I think they're from the institute.

55
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:01,832
- Did you recognize them?
- Mmm-mm.

56
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,665
No.

57
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,282
Where were you?

58
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:10,775
I was studying and... and...

59
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,491
and looking for Garrett, and then...

60
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:14,184
- Did you find him?
- ... and...

61
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,623
No. I-I...

62
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,059
It's not my fault.

63
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:23,513
You were supposed to be watching her.

64
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,116
She was still here an hour
ago when I checked in on her.

65
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,559
She took the van.

66
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,011
She'll be back. She always...

67
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,474
I know she'll be back.

68
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:35,584
The problem is what she
does when she's gone.

69
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:43,146
Do you believe me now? They've found us.

70
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:54,807
- What are you doing?
- We've got to get out of here.

71
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:40,846
Do you know where Agatha is?

72
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,505
No.

73
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:46,970
But you two were together, right?

74
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:50,319
Look, I can send someone
else to go find her

75
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:51,382
and bring her back to me,

76
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,326
but it'd be easier if it were you.

77
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:04,413
Feels so good.

78
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,551
We'll all be okay, right?

79
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:18,749
Like we used to be?

80
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:22,830
We'll all be okay if I tell you?

81
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:24,878
Yeah, Garrett.

82
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,815
Of course, dude.

83
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,799
I've got to take this.

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,568
Wait. Don't go.

85
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,839
Logan, you're scaring me.

86
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:49,764
It's okay. It's okay. Just...

87
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,382
it's just a nightmare.

88
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:57,253
Do you have any... p...

89
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:58,825
do you have any pills or anything?

90
00:05:58,826 --> 00:05:59,891
Pills?

91
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,934
Yeah, benzos,
painkillers, just anything.

92
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,640
- I don't think I have any...
- I'm in pain, Kylie. Please!

93
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,332
Maybe. Hold on.

94
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,690
Fuck!

95
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,196
Where are you?

96
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:13,730
You can't lock me up like that, Parker.

97
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:15,291
You know that doesn't work for me.

98
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:17,084
You know that from the
test at the institute.

99
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:19,674
Breeda, will you please
get back here now?

100
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,455
I found Kennedy Chapman.

101
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,320
Wait, how did you find her?

102
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:25,160
That doesn't matter.

103
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,039
They're setting up a network out here.

104
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:29,027
Housing them, helping them.

105
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:31,171
Well, can you bring her here?

106
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:34,915
She's not being cooperative.

107
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:38,049
I have these.

108
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,226
They're left over from when
I sprained my ankle on set.

109
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:44,126
I took a couple, but they
made me feel really sick.

110
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:47,768
- Do you want water for...
- Yeah.

111
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:50,609
Well, I feel sick when
I don't take them, Kylie.

112
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,495
Your phone was blowing
up when you were asleep.

113
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:00,272
I'm sorry. Thank you.

114
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:01,899
Guess you're pretty popular, huh?

115
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,016
Yeah. Yeah.

116
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:07,190
Everyone's chasing me,

117
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:09,117
and I'm laying low.

118
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,768
What day is it?

119
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:14,735
It's Saturday.

120
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,702
You've been out for almost two days.

121
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:18,601
Who is that?

122
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:22,217
Just a person that I
didn't think needed me.

123
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,805
Oh, fuck.

124
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:27,538
Breeda, our only concern
is finding the others.

125
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,096
She's going to tell me
where everyone's hiding.

126
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:33,061
Breeda, Breeda, please do not hurt her.

127
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:34,213
I don't want you to hurt her.

128
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:36,356
I just want you to bring her back
here so we can talk to her. That's all.

129
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:38,318
You don't care about the others.

130
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:40,284
You only care about one thing,

131
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:41,820
- and that's not the others.
- Breeda...

132
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:45,556
Breeda, I'm just doing a
job, and I care about you.

133
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:47,975
Please do not hurt this girl.

134
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:49,825
We are not at the institute anymore.

135
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,780
We need to do things differently here.

136
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,448
I know we're not at the institute

137
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,147
'cause you can't tell
me what to do anymore.

138
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,255
Breeda! Breeda, will you p...

139
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:32,097
We have hourly rates too, you know.

140
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:35,398
What is that supposed to mean?

141
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,878
Where are the others from
the institute, Kennedy?

142
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,621
- No! No!
- Breeda?

143
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,510
Hey, hey, come on, focus.

144
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:23,892
Breeda, look at me. Breeda?

145
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,918
I don't like the question.

146
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,650
Well, you're not supposed to
like or not like the question.

147
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:30,397
I mean, do you understand that?

148
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:32,905
Ask me again.

149
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:37,209
Do you ever think about what
you want to be when you grow up?

150
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,614
Yes.

151
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,594
Well, when you see
yourself in the future,

152
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:43,150
what are you doing?

153
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm in control of everything.
