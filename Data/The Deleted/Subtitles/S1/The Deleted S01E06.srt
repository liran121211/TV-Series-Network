1
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:26,954
Who are you?

2
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:28,513
What do you want?

3
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:30,479
I was looking for someone.

4
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:33,346
The door was open. Is everything okay?

5
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:39,114
My girlfriend's gone missing.

6
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:40,574
She left. I...

7
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:42,738
I don't know.

8
00:00:42,763 --> 00:00:44,746
Do you know where she went?

9
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,247
No.

10
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:48,832
I don't.

11
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,331
Do you want me to help you find her?

12
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,979
You know where she is.

13
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:02,804
You know where she is, don't you?

14
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:22,850
You're home now, Agatha.

15
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:25,072
You're safe.

16
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:27,996
Do you have any? I need it.

17
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:30,554
I need it. Do you have any?

18
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:32,250
Why do you need it so badly?

19
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,003
Why do you need the Guidance?

20
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:37,800
Guidance is the only thing
that makes the pain go away.

21
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:43,152
It's the only thing that makes me feel.

22
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,904
Agatha, why did you leave the compound?

23
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:51,542
Please?

24
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,675
Why did you... why did
you... Agatha, look at me.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,439
- Why did you get on that bus?
- Please?

26
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:59,282
Did Logan... did he say anything
to you to influence your decision?

27
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:03,303
Please? I'll tell you everything
you need to know. Just help me.

28
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:05,630
Please?

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,693
Please?

30
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,669
Why would you think I know
where your girlfriend is?

31
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,028
That's weird.

32
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,256
Why have I never seen you?

33
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:42,700
Maybe you weren't looking.

34
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:48,125
They taught you how to do that,

35
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,336
didn't they, at the institute?

36
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,839
Taught me what? What institute?

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,551
How to... act normal,

38
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,846
fake everything.

39
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:03,612
You're the Genesis patient.

40
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:09,483
You never even knew how to be natural.

41
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,165
That was their goal.
You never had limits.

42
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,838
You don't know anything about me.

43
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,157
I know that you were... made...

44
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,491
by a committee in a lab.

45
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,111
Where is she?

46
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:37,114
- Yeah?
- Hey.

47
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:41,468
Do you want to come out
and meet some of my friends?

48
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,525
Just casual.

49
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,308
Um, not really.

50
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,475
Just for a second?

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,519
Please? They think you're hot!

52
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,321
Yeah. If they only knew...

53
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,659
Yeah.

54
00:03:58,684 --> 00:04:00,644
That's what I said.

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,832
Um, let me clean up, okay?

56
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,146
Okay.

57
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,087
So none of you...

58
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,215
called the police or
anything like that, right?

59
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,698
No. No, nothing like that.

60
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,680
Not even Ryder?

61
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:27,131
Ryder isn't like that, Parker.

62
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:29,360
Why isn't he like that?

63
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:33,175
Because he's afraid of
what you're capable of.

64
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:35,627
He shouldn't be afraid.

65
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,008
I hate that he's afraid.

66
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,417
I hate it too.

67
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,052
And that's why we need
to get him back, right?

68
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,045
Yeah.

69
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:59,323
We never should've left.

70
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:01,783
It wasn't your fault.

71
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:04,137
It wasn't your fault. It was Logan.

72
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,826
How would I know where
your girlfriend is...

73
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,041
if I don't even know you?

74
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:14,374
No, we haven't met,
but I know what you...

75
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,194
Fuck!

76
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,537
Fuck!

77
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,087
Hey. What's up?

78
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,812
Hey. You're Kylie's cousin, right?

79
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:06,105
Yeah. Hey.

80
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,821
And I'm Jessica. I'm her friend.

81
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:16,221
Jessica.

82
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,561
Okay.

83
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:20,207
I'm on the show with Kylie.
We just wrapped season two.

84
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,797
"Show"?

85
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:25,128
What show? You guys are
on a show together or...

86
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,173
You didn't know Kylie stars on a show?

87
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:31,741
Actually, no, I actually do. Um...

88
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,009
Th-the... what's it called again?

89
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,806
I think I've seen it before. It's...

90
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,016
It's called Band Together.

91
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,186
- Just a group of girls.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That show.

92
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,442
For some reason, I thought that...

93
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:47,191
you were talking about
something else, so I... yeah.

94
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,699
Is this, like, a...

95
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:50,961
is this, like, a joke? Are you serious?

96
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,740
Um...

97
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,478
I've just been...

98
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:58,224
I've been gone for a while, and, uh...

99
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:01,165
I've actually been out of the
country for a long time, and...

100
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,259
I'm just trying to acclimate myself.

101
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:06,003
A little piece of advice?

102
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,027
You should make sure
you're completely acclimated

103
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,425
before you start
conversations like this.

104
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:15,944
It's super awkward, and it'll
save you a ton of embarrassment.

105
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,635
I'm all right.

106
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:02,553
We should get out of here.

107
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,819
I got a couple friends,
they're throwing a party.

108
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,716
It'll be fun.

109
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,312
Yeah.

110
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,422
Come on.

111
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,060
You'll dig this place, I think.

112
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:14,461
It's on the beach, in Malibu.

113
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,550
Malibu? Really?

114
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,527
That's right.

115
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,348
It'll be fun.

116
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,809
Yeah.

117
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,854
I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun.
