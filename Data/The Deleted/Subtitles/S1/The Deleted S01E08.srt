1
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,300
So we finally get to
record your brother.

2
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:14,953
You've, um, finally allowed
us to do this, Parker.

3
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:19,045
Yes, yes. This is Ryder,
my younger brother.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,968
Half brother. We have different dads.

5
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:23,764
And how did you come to be with us...

6
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,750
here at the institute, Ryder?

7
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:29,212
Uh...

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,544
Frankly, the women are extremely hot.

9
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:35,403
Meaning? What does this mean?

10
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:37,621
Meaning, I introduced
him to a few girls online,

11
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:41,322
and, uh... he never really
got the entire vibe of...

12
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:43,910
of what really happened
here at the institute,

13
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:46,161
but I introduced him to
Sandy and Ebra after that.

14
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:48,162
- Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
- And, yeah...

15
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:50,996
and that was six months ago,
and he hopped on a plane, and...

16
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:52,790
now we're together again.

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,917
It's cool.

18
00:00:53,942 --> 00:00:56,248
How long have you been
here at the institute?

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,717
Like three years.
Maybe three and a half.

20
00:00:59,742 --> 00:01:03,209
I met this guy online.
Well, he reached out to me.

21
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:04,502
And who was that?

22
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:06,005
Uh, Jeff Calloway.

23
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,698
He reached out to me, and
then he left a year later.

24
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:13,004
Uh, do you know why Jeff
Calloway left the institute?

25
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:16,108
No, actually. Uh, I have no idea.

26
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:19,052
But... he's who got me here.

27
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:21,009
And how did he do that?

28
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:26,132
He made me fall in love with him.

29
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:29,339
When did you get here?

30
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:31,740
About two and a half years ago.

31
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:33,977
And how did you find yourself here?

32
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:36,162
- I was invited.
- By who?

33
00:01:36,187 --> 00:01:38,889
- Agatha.
- Oh, right. Um...

34
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:40,603
And how did you meet Agatha?

35
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:43,932
She reached out to me online randomly,

36
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:46,464
and she had seen my Instagram

37
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:49,831
and thought I was cute, I guess.

38
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,501
And then what happened?

39
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:54,045
Then I kind of liked her,

40
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:56,491
from, you know, what I could see,

41
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,694
and as we talked,

42
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,417
I really started liking her.

43
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:03,568
And then she actually invited me...

44
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:05,242
to meet her in Olympia.

45
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:07,879
So, um, how are you
feeling today, Mason?

46
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:10,053
Uh, I'm a little tired.

47
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:13,565
- Yeah? Why?
- That party. The gathering.

48
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,734
Last night got kind of crazy.

49
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,643
I did some things that I've
never done before but...

50
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,400
always wanted to try, I guess.

51
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:28,033
It was fun. I... really got off.

52
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:30,642
We are updating our video
files with everyone here

53
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:34,395
and just want to confirm how
you arrived at the institute,

54
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,977
which was, um, five years ago, right?

55
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:39,559
Yeah. I met a member here online.

56
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:41,273
And that member was?

57
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:42,985
Logan Conrad.

58
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,924
I, uh, reached out to
him on his Instagram.

59
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:49,180
I thought he was really hot, and, um...

60
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:52,455
I mean, I never knew this place
existed when he got back to me.

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,940
You're looking a little
scruffy there, Logan.

62
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:56,862
How are you doing?

63
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,500
Good. I'm doing good.

64
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:03,633
So I hear you're doing a
final update on everyone.

65
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:05,949
Did Ted freak out about something?

66
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,846
Why don't you just tell them
what you're really looking for?

67
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,584
Why don't you just tell them?

68
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,988
I mean, why are you so concerned
if they made it this far?

69
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:17,973
Well, we do tell them ultimately.

70
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,483
I mean, we just look for
any deviations, any cracks.

71
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:22,832
I mean, it's just a way
of monitoring things.

72
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:26,235
Well, I remember...

73
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,878
when I first got here.

74
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,071
You know, living in
an alternative world,

75
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:32,255
saying "fuck you" to the status quo,

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,753
all the drugs paid for...

77
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,400
I mean, who doesn't like that?

78
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,542
And it doesn't hurt that
everyone here is fucking hot.

79
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:41,003
Ryder, do you miss your home?

80
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:42,987
Um...

81
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:44,549
I'd probably say no.

82
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:46,011
Yeah, no, the answer's no.

83
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:49,560
Um... are you beginning
to understand fully

84
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:53,265
what is expected of you here,
and are you okay with it?

85
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,218
Has it been okay so far?

86
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:57,744
Yeah. I mean, you guys
give me a place to live...

87
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:00,762
here at the institute, and...

88
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:03,228
in return, I give you my commitment

89
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:06,399
to explore my personal freedom and,

90
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:09,979
um, maximize my natural potential.

91
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,599
Uh, do you understand
what it means exactly by...

92
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:17,553
"exploring your personal freedom"?

93
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:18,895
Yeah.

94
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:22,152
Yeah, I think I'm beginning to.

95
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:24,947
Would you say you're happy here, Logan?

96
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:28,328
Really? You're really asking me that?

97
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,133
Well, yeah, I mean...

98
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:31,462
Look, you had that scene

99
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:33,852
at the "Come Into Spring"
party two months ago,

100
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:37,171
- and people...
- I took too much Guidance.

101
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,782
I freaked out. It happens.

102
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,757
Well, we're only asking
because, as a senior member,

103
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:46,951
you've been here, what,
almost ten years now,

104
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:50,437
um, that a certain amount of trust

105
00:04:50,462 --> 00:04:53,798
needs to be maintained on both sides,

106
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:55,958
and we don't want anyone to...

107
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,228
What, are you...

108
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,064
... be antagonistic or have problems...

109
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:01,894
or, you know...

110
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,468
Are you suggesting that I have
a grudge against the institute?

111
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:07,735
That's crazy.

112
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,044
No, dude, no. Like,
you're overthinking it.

113
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:13,796
I feel at home at the institute,

114
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:16,223
'cause... I feel like

115
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:19,939
there are no labels to
a person's sexuality.

116
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:22,754
So you don't feel uncomfortable
that you have been,

117
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,028
now after five years,

118
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:29,243
with both men and women, both
genders, here at the institute?

119
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,887
I feel more comfortable.

120
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:34,039
Would you say you've
excelled in these sessions?

121
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,242
Definitely, yeah.

122
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:39,102
These are samples of a
new version of Guidance

123
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:42,390
that we have been developing here
at the institute in the last year.

124
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:43,675
We've been doing test studies

125
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,264
with subjects not affiliated
with the institute,

126
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,440
and now we want to try
it on a group of members

127
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:50,841
who have been selected at random.

128
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,650
We would never do anything
to put you at risk,

129
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:55,797
and if you're uncomfortable
continuing with any of this,

130
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,779
please tell me.

131
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,322
What do I do with it?

132
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,313
Well, unlike the original Guidance,

133
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:02,418
this can be inhaled by spray

134
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,719
or applied topically on
or near mucous membranes,

135
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:07,066
or you can drink it.

136
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:10,615
Um, you choose how to administer it.

137
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,432
Can-can I do more?

138
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:25,276
Mason?

139
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:27,858
Mason?

140
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:32,594
You didn't want Ryder
in the room anymore.

141
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:34,453
Why?

142
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,651
I just feel that...

143
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:39,534
using the Guidance this
early in his teaching

144
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,644
could be damaging for long-term.

145
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,323
'Cause when I first
got to the institute,

146
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,750
I took Guidance almost
immediately, and...

147
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:47,307
I was not prepared for it.

148
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:49,167
I just think that at the beginning,

149
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:53,100
there's so much information
that you're taking in.

150
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,548
I think that should be
enough at the beginning,

151
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:57,060
and I think later,

152
00:06:57,085 --> 00:07:00,681
if he wants to expand his
potential for feeling and thought,

153
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:02,818
then he should take the
Guidance, because it does do that,

154
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:04,861
but I think he needs
to be more mature first.

155
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:06,567
Look, in just two years,

156
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,052
you've really proved yourself to be
one of the most loyal members here,

157
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:12,310
and your commitment to the
institute has been really remarkable,

158
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:15,212
and especially for
someone so young. Um...

159
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:19,019
- Thank you.
- But there is just the faint idea

160
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:22,664
that there are things
about the institute

161
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:26,316
that you, uh, you would
like to see changed,

162
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,666
and that's why, I don't know,

163
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:30,405
it makes me a little bit ambivalent

164
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,385
when you discuss how
the Guidance should be...

165
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,766
- administered to your brother.
- No. That is not my intention at all.

166
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,714
- I'm very sorry.
- I want you to calm down.

167
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:40,523
- This is not... it's not a big deal.
- Okay.

168
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:42,049
I feel that you're really tense.

169
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:43,795
Just calm down about it.

170
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,353
Garrett?

171
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:46,731
Garrett.

172
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,274
Yeah?

173
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:49,691
Go ahead.

174
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:51,167
It's okay.

175
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:53,860
You can do it.

176
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:56,926
What would happen to you
when you took the Guidance?

177
00:07:56,951 --> 00:08:00,620
I would just freak out, and it
was a really terrifying experience,

178
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,882
and it didn't do anything that
my teachers told me that it would.

179
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:05,043
It was affecting my work here.

180
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,242
- I was anxious all the time.
- Uh, uh... Parker,

181
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,425
would you like to see Breeda again?

182
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,189
What-what do you mean see her again?

183
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:13,812
I'm one of the main
members taking care of her.

184
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:18,267
Uh, yeah, but how would you
feel if you never saw her again?

185
00:08:19,272 --> 00:08:22,076
How would I feel? I...
What are you saying?

186
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,393
Well, this is just a test, Parker.

187
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:27,963
We want to see how Guidance affects
certain members of the community, and...

188
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:30,774
Actually we did choose you to
be one of the test subjects.

189
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:31,872
It wasn't random at all.

190
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,302
I'm just... I don't know what
this has to do with Breeda.

191
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:37,412
Well, if you test the Guidance,
we'll let you see her again.

192
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:40,648
And if you don't, uh,
we've talked about it,

193
00:08:40,673 --> 00:08:44,356
and we might just take you
off the Genesis project.

194
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:47,960
Is this for real?

195
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:50,004
How does that feel, Garrett?

196
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:56,585
It feels fucking great.

197
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,079
Agatha?

198
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:05,087
Could you, um, pour yourself
a large glass of the vodka?

199
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,450
Uh, no. Can you pour
yourself a little bit more?

200
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,173
Uh, can you put it up to... to the brim?

201
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:26,615
That's good. That's good.

202
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,981
Um, now can you please
drink the entire glass?

203
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:55,157
Could you please pour
yourself another glass?

204
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:56,825
I feel scared.

205
00:09:56,974 --> 00:09:58,933
Take the Guidance, and you won't.

206
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,632
I just... I really want
to see Breeda again.

207
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,960
Take the Guidance.

208
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:13,857
You should be feeling it immediately.

209
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,913
I, uh... okay.

210
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:19,227
How long does this last?

211
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:21,556
Well, are you feeling it yet?

212
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:22,971
I think so.

213
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,401
If I do more, can I see Breeda?

214
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:28,282
Agatha, can you hear us?

215
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:30,980
Yeah.

216
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:32,784
- You can?
- Yeah.

217
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,299
Are you okay?

218
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,839
I'm feeling good.

219
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:39,807
You don't feel sick or
anything from the vodka?

220
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:42,511
No.

221
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:46,170
You drank a very large
quantity of vodka very quickly.

222
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:49,553
I feel fine.

223
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:52,740
Logan, can you, um,

224
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:55,804
lift Agatha up and
place her on the desk?

225
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:02,593
Garrett? Come on. Garrett?

226
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:03,835
Yeah?

227
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,267
Um...

228
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:06,627
Can you, um,

229
00:11:06,652 --> 00:11:11,342
make an incision just
below your left nipple?

230
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,112
There you go.

231
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:21,805
Lift Agatha's face up by her chin.

232
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,466
With your other hand,

233
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:27,026
I want you to slap her
hard across the face.

234
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,557
Agatha, how did that feel?

235
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:32,313
I want him to fuck me.

236
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:34,067
But what if he doesn't?
What would you do?

237
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,279
If he rejects you, what would you do?

238
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,091
Don't let go, Agatha.

239
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,032
Keep choking him. Don't let go.

240
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:42,762
- What are you feeling?
- Powerful. Feel in control.

241
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,260
Do you feel like you're hurting him?

242
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:46,378
Do you feel like it's too much?

243
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:48,098
No.

244
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:50,661
Parker...

245
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:52,341
- Why did you make me do this?
- Parker, come on.

246
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,004
Parker, come on.

247
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:55,430
- I knew it wouldn't work!
- Parker.

248
00:11:55,455 --> 00:11:57,970
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Deep breaths. Deep breaths!

249
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:00,328
Parker? Parker?

250
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,965
Hold him down. Bring
her in. Bring her in now.

251
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:06,283
Breeda! Breeda!

252
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:10,011
What should I do?

253
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,579
Well, what you always do:

254
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,095
whatever you want.
