1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:01,944
I just really need to talk to somebody.

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,412
Can you meet me, please?

3
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,646
Logan said that we shouldn't
even be texting each other,

4
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:07,539
let alone meeting in person.

5
00:00:07,816 --> 00:00:09,318
Mason?

6
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:12,787
Kennedy, I really
need someone to talk...

7
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:13,838
Agatha, I told you,

8
00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:16,273
you can only call this number
in case of an emergency.

9
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:17,366
There's someone here.

10
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:19,277
I know it was my idea to bring Breeda.

11
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:22,317
Out of her environment, yes, I
know that she's more aggressive.

12
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:25,982
Logan? Logan?

13
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,223
Logan.

14
00:01:17,386 --> 00:01:19,282
Did you sleep well last night?

15
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:24,814
I think we should get out of here.

16
00:01:25,394 --> 00:01:27,395
You mean, like, for breakfast?

17
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:31,357
No. I mean out of this
fucking place. Out of L.A.

18
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,456
And why would we do that?

19
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,196
I know you think I'm paranoid,

20
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,191
but they have found us.

21
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:43,119
So say we leave, Agatha.
Say we go somewhere.

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,686
You're just gonna get paranoid again,

23
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:48,684
and then we'll move again and
again, and it'll never stop.

24
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,061
They will never fucking stop.

25
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,921
There's no proof that they've found us.

26
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:56,584
Okay. So where in the fuck is Logan?

27
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,287
Where's Mason? Where's Garrett?

28
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:00,219
They're all fucking gone, Ryder.

29
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,097
Logan hasn't responded
to a soul in months.

30
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:05,739
Mason's probably off on a bender, and...

31
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:09,834
yeah, I guess it's pretty fucking
weird Garrett hasn't responded...

32
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:11,595
especially to you.

33
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,109
Are you listening to
me? He's fucking gone.

34
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,372
Probably didn't want to deal with you.

35
00:02:15,397 --> 00:02:16,706
Oh, fuck you.

36
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:19,447
He went to go meet up with Mason,

37
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:21,513
and now he's just... he's fucking gone.

38
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:23,951
Wait. Why was he with Mason?

39
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:25,429
Mason texted Garrett.

40
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:27,973
He was all fucked up, he was on drugs,

41
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:30,521
and Garrett went to meet up with him,

42
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:33,180
and I haven't heard from
either of them, so...

43
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:36,665
I don't know. I'm worried.

44
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:42,705
Will, uh... will you
go check on Garrett?

45
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:44,842
Me?

46
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,187
- Yeah.
- Jesus, Agatha, why?

47
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:48,327
Why can't you go check on him?

48
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:50,088
I-I don't know if he
doesn't want to talk to me.

49
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:51,351
I don't know what's going on.

50
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:55,369
Can you please, please,
just go check on him for me?

51
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,110
Please? I'm freaking out!

52
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,887
I don't know what's going on! Help me!

53
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:25,688
Hello?

54
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:38,659
Garrett?

55
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,165
Hey, I'm a friend of
Garrett's. My name's Ryder.

56
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,311
He said he was gonna go meet a friend.

57
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,803
- Was it Mason?
- No.

58
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:49,722
It wasn't Mason.

59
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,857
But I know it was that bitch...

60
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:53,478
Agatha.

61
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,644
Well, why would he be with Agatha?

62
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,998
Because he's fucking her.

63
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:02,936
I came home yesterday,
and they were both here...

64
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:04,361
naked...

65
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,947
and they pulled me into this
fucked-up thing, and I...

66
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:09,901
So you guys were, like, all together.

67
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:12,123
That's what I fucking said.

68
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,575
I know he's with her right now.

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,290
I know it. I know he's with that slut.

70
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,459
I mean, it... it might not be...

71
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,920
- it could be anyone.
- I fucking love him.

72
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,929
Don't you get that?

73
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:25,810
And he's fucking her.

74
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:42,650
Hey, uh, can I help you with something?

75
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:45,277
Uh, does Garrett work here?

76
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,780
Uh, not today. He called in sick.

77
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,184
- I'm here though.
- Are you a friend of Garrett?

78
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,993
Yeah, yeah, Garrett. That's
my guy. I know Garrett.

79
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:55,727
- Why?
- I'm from Washington.

80
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:57,957
He told me to hit him
up when I'm in L.A.,

81
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,001
but he hasn't been returning my texts.

82
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:03,482
- I'm lost.
- Oh, wow.

83
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:07,174
Uh, well, I get off of
here in, like, an hour.

84
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:10,010
We could hang out. You know,
maybe go get something to eat.

85
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,965
We can probably find out why
Garrett's not texting you back.

86
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,963
It'd be great if you could help me.

87
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:20,240
Hit me.

88
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:22,202
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:12,790
What the fuck?

90
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:15,951
Fucking crazy bitch! Fuck!

91
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:20,389
I'm fucking her, about to come,

92
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:22,206
and she fucking scratches
the shit out of me.

93
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,352
I just threw her off.

94
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,338
Just get your shit. Let's go.

95
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:26,780
Oh, fuck.

96
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,061
Yeah, my roommates are
gone. They're not home.

97
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,759
It's like I never see them.

98
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,166
You smoke?

99
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:47,249
Cigarettes? No.

100
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:49,155
I meant weed.

101
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,664
Who is that?

102
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:55,822
Who?

103
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,251
Is that your girlfriend?

104
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:00,454
Who?

105
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:02,703
Her. That girl.

106
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:06,460
Rihanna?

107
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:07,877
Is she your friend?

108
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:09,630
Does Garrett know her?

109
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,840
Look, Garrett doesn't...
She's not... Wait...

110
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,634
Wait, where are you from again?

111
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:16,565
Washington, just outside of Olympia.

112
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:19,478
And you don't know who Rihanna is?

113
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:23,375
Do you have the same number
for Garrett that I have?

114
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,482
I have to let you know,

115
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:30,317
I don't have his number.

116
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:32,177
I don't even know Garrett.

117
00:08:32,202 --> 00:08:34,673
- I'm sorry.
- You don't know who Garrett is?

118
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,393
I don't.

119
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,492
But I think you're really cute,

120
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:40,778
and I would love to help you.

121
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:42,329
I just don't know Garrett.

122
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,896
I know we work at the shop together,

123
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:45,991
but he has different shifts from me.

124
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,694
You think I'm cute?

125
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:52,265
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

126
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:56,907
Would you want to have sex with me?

127
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:00,140
Definitely.

128
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:10,730
What time do your,
uh, roommates get home?

129
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:13,477
We've got some time.

130
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:21,526
Where have you been?

131
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,934
Breeda?

132
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,513
Breeda.

133
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,725
Please answer me. Where have you been?

134
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,706
You can't just run away like that.

135
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:38,570
Walking along the beach.

136
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,453
Well, where were you?

137
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:42,950
Took the Metro downtown.

138
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:46,021
What were you doing down there?

139
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:49,798
Just doing what we came here to do.

140
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,585
I was... I was just... I
was so worried about you.

141
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,687
You're my responsibility. You
can't just disappear like that.

142
00:10:57,377 --> 00:10:59,174
I was looking for Garrett.

143
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,278
Just doing my job.

144
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:06,927
Breeda, Garrett and Mason are here.

145
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,041
They're here. They're safe.
