1
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:21,004
It looks deserted.

2
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,049
I don't think they're there anymore.

3
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:18,338
You said this place was empty.

4
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:22,023
I thought it was.

5
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:23,652
Who are you?

6
00:01:23,677 --> 00:01:25,610
What are you doing here?

7
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:28,369
Just... hanging.

8
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,611
The house was just empty, dude,

9
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:33,396
and we were just hanging out, so...

10
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:37,054
Look, this house belongs to us.

11
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,164
Oh.

12
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,747
Why do you have so many beds?

13
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,393
So when friends stay over,
they have somewhere to sleep.

14
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,750
Can we join you?

15
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:10,925
All right, I'm about to go to school.

16
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,387
Are you okay?

17
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,327
- I'm fine.

18
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,717
I'll be back around
5:00. Maybe we could...

19
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:20,790
you know, get some
food or watch something.

20
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,783
Yeah, maybe.

21
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,312
This isn't forever, Agatha, I promise.

22
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,468
Wh-what's... what is that?

23
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:33,887
A-are you texting? Who are you texting?

24
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,540
- Mason.
- What?

25
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:37,148
Not Garrett?

26
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:38,266
No.

27
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:40,327
- You promise you're not...
- No, I'm not texting Garrett.

28
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:42,885
Can we just not do this again?
I don't want to play this scene.

29
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,437
You're not supposed
to be texting anybody.

30
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:46,326
What are you... what are
you doing contacting people?

31
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:49,124
- That's how they'll find us.
- Maybe I want to be found.

32
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:54,036
You don't mean that, right?

33
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:56,935
I was looking right at you.

34
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:59,440
What were you thinking?

35
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:03,681
I was thinking we could come
to some sort of an agreement.

36
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,107
Yeah?

37
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:07,369
What kind of agreement?

38
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:12,482
You can't take the bottles, okay?
I'm not gonna press any charges...

39
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:28,454
- Where have you been?
- For a run.

40
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,039
I don't believe you.

41
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,041
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Stop.

42
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,937
What, Sophie?

43
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,647
- Take off your shorts.
- No.

44
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:39,507
- Take off your shorts now, Garrett!
- I'm not in the mood.

45
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:41,016
You've been cutting again, haven't you?

46
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,105
- You've been fucking cutting...
- Just leave me alone!

47
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,684
Do I make you unhappy?

48
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,163
Are you unhappy here?

49
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,056
Let me in.

50
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:55,857
Just tell me what happened to you.

51
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:57,595
What happened to me?

52
00:06:57,898 --> 00:06:59,975
You want to know what happened to me?

53
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,709
I don't think you could handle it.

54
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,431
Breeda?

55
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,224
Breeda?

56
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:53,784
Breeda?

57
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,611
Breeda?

58
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,550
Hey.

59
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:06,761
Ow!

60
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:32,551
No! Agatha, you need to
learn how to control it!

61
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:35,016
God, you have to learn
how to control it, Agatha.

62
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:36,752
Where do you think we are?

63
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,470
We're not there anymore.

64
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:44,149
That was really intense.

65
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:46,181
Can we get together again?

66
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:48,657
I don't do repeats.

67
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,958
Yeah, it's definitely him.

68
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,348
The front door's unlocked.

69
00:10:19,422 --> 00:10:20,882
Three bucks.

70
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,081
- Excuse me.
- Uh, sorry.

71
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:41,958
I've got to use the restroom.

72
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:36,400
Get off me.

73
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:40,514
Get off me.

74
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,826
He's here. We got him.

75
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,250
Okay. I'll be right up.

76
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,850
I have been here, what,
almost ten years now.

77
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,332
Trust needs to be
maintained on both sides,

78
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:07,493
- and we don't want anyone to...
- Leave?

79
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:10,478
... be antagonistic or have problems,

80
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:12,439
or, you know...

81
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,984
Are you suggesting that I have
a grudge against the institute?

82
00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:17,986
That's crazy.

83
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:21,531
No, dude, no. Like, you're overthinking.
