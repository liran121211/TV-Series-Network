1
00:00:04,495 --> 00:00:06,498
Agatha. Agatha!

2
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:07,916
They're looking for you.

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,568
I think they're from the institute.

4
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,561
What are you gonna do
if you find everybody?

5
00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:17,123
I'm going to give them back what
Logan took away... their freedom.

6
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:19,238
You can't lock me up like that, Parker.

7
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:20,476
You were supposed to be watching her.

8
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,095
She was still here an hour
ago when I checked in on her.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,201
She'll be back.

10
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:26,272
The problem is what she
does when she's gone.

11
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:27,856
Who is that?

12
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:29,599
Just a person that I
didn't think needed me.

13
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:31,376
We need to do things differently here.

14
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:33,702
You can't tell me what to do anymore.

15
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,440
- You talked to Logan?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:46,520
Are you... are you gonna see him?

17
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:48,722
I think so. I... But...

18
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:50,057
But what?

19
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:54,228
What if it's a trap?

20
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,511
- Hey.
- Hey.

21
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,221
Um,

22
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:31,059
I'm going out for a bit.

23
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,484
Where are you going?

24
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:34,856
I'm just gonna go meet
a friend, you know,

25
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:36,881
one of those people that called me.

26
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:40,273
Are you gonna come back?

27
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:42,844
Yeah. Yeah. Um...

28
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,169
But if I don't, just...

29
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:47,823
don't get anyone else
involved, all right?

30
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:49,849
Can you promise me that?

31
00:02:49,874 --> 00:02:51,598
If I don't come back, just let it go.

32
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:53,518
Don't call the police, okay?

33
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,872
I'm gonna need a little more than that.

34
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:01,002
Did your parents ever...

35
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:03,343
mention anything about me?

36
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:05,215
Like, what happened to me

37
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,417
or where I was for ten years?

38
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:10,196
No. I mean,

39
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:13,547
it was something that
wasn't really mentioned.

40
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:16,747
We all knew you were gone, but...

41
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:23,260
So... so then there's
no mention at all...

42
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:25,750
of the Lonergan Institute?

43
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:29,687
I was just 15, all right?

44
00:03:29,712 --> 00:03:31,870
I was fucked up, and...

45
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:36,096
I met these really
interesting people, and, um...

46
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:39,416
and I lived with them
for ten years, and now...

47
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,394
now I'm back.

48
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,985
I was surprised to hear back from you.

49
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:51,288
Yeah. Everybody's been reaching out.

50
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:54,991
I... I need to explain... everything.

51
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,602
Yeah. What happened, man?

52
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:57,863
Why did you abandon us?

53
00:04:57,888 --> 00:04:59,867
First off, it was part
of the arrangement.

54
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:02,061
I get everybody out of Lonergan,

55
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,048
you guys disappear in LA,

56
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:06,318
and there's people out here
who are willing to help you out,

57
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:07,587
but you take it from there.

58
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:09,393
- Yeah, and that's fine...
- And that's part of the arrangement,

59
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:11,883
all right? I wouldn't
be in touch with you.

60
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,219
I want to explain to you what happened.

61
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,710
What did you think would happen?

62
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,337
You abandoned us!

63
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:20,240
Agatha and I are hiding
out in a shitty hotel.

64
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,493
Hey.

65
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:45,455
Where's Mason? Did you find him?

66
00:05:45,797 --> 00:05:48,227
- Where was he? Is he okay?
- He's fine.

67
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:49,619
He's better now.

68
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:50,755
- He's fine?
- Calm down.

69
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:51,761
He's fucking fine?

70
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:53,501
He was breaking down and wasted...

71
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:54,995
- Look, you've got to calm down, okay?
- ... two days ago.

72
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,496
It's gonna be okay.

73
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:57,815
- Everything is gonna be okay.
- Oh, my God.

74
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,964
Fuck you, Garrett.

75
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:01,358
I'm hiding out in a fucking motel,

76
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:02,876
and everything is gonna be okay?

77
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:05,243
You disappeared! We're
all fucking doomed!

78
00:06:05,268 --> 00:06:07,349
Look, you found me, Agatha.

79
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:08,993
You brought me in to the institute.

80
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:11,067
If I'm trying to help
you, why are you so angry?

81
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:12,902
I was just doing what I was told.

82
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:15,947
- But you picked me.
- No, I didn't pick you.

83
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:17,433
The institute picked you.

84
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,200
They have a type, and you fit the type.

85
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,841
You were living in some shit town,

86
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:22,507
with some fucking shit family

87
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:23,740
- who does not give a fuck...
- Really? Really?

88
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:25,524
- ... where you end up.
- You brought me to Olympia

89
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:27,813
because I fit a fucking type? Really?

90
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:31,037
No, I picked you because
I'd fallen in love with you.

91
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:36,376
Well, this is not about
the institute anymore.

92
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:38,510
I'm not here because of the institute,

93
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:40,221
I'm here because of us.

94
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:42,599
- Our connection.
- Our connection?

95
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:45,102
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what fucking connection?

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,564
We don't have a connection.
You're with that little girl,

97
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:51,649
and I'm with Ryder, and we
have no fucking connection.

98
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,651
Ryder is a boy. He's all about control.

99
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:56,154
He doesn't care about sex.
He doesn't care about love.

100
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:59,449
Yes, he does care about
love, because he loves me.

101
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,102
And I need him. I need that.

102
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:08,760
Don't you want to be touched again?

103
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,051
Don't you want to be worshipped?

104
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:20,987
Don't you want to surrender again?

105
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:38,351
Where did you get that?

106
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:52,891
You're so beautiful.

107
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:32,417
Yeah, I understand that man, but...

108
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:36,358
half the people on that bus
had no idea what you were doing.

109
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:37,623
There's people on there that thought

110
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:38,887
they were going to a
fucking supermarket,

111
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:40,492
and we all ended up on a beach...

112
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:42,349
- in Los Angeles.
- Everybody on that bus...

113
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:43,853
... had been warned.

114
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,555
You knew what was happening.

115
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:47,300
You knew what was happening,

116
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,045
Garrett knew what was happening,

117
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,031
all of them knew what was happening.

118
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:55,356
But they didn't.

119
00:08:55,357 --> 00:08:56,819
You didn't tell everyone, man.

120
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:58,443
You needed to tell everyone.

121
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:01,654
There's people on that bus that don't
have any memories of the outside world.

122
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:05,061
I risked my life to save you guys.

123
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:08,183
Do you understand that I
risked my life for that?

124
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,162
Gwen Douglas killed herself.

125
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,122
Did you hear that?

126
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:55,083
Yeah, I heard.

127
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:58,360
A week after we got here,
she took her own life.

128
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,424
Maybe the arrangement
wasn't working out for her.

129
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:05,599
No, Ryder.

130
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,178
Gwen just couldn't take
the idea of going back.

131
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,823
Why did you avoid everybody's calls?

132
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:17,634
Because, man. Because I lost control.

133
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,798
You mean you got caught up.
You got strung the fuck out.

134
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,071
I don't think you fully knew

135
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:27,416
what was going on in the institute.

136
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:30,301
I knew what I saw. I
know what you told me.

137
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:33,246
Yeah, but you don't know what
was going on in House Seven,

138
00:10:33,247 --> 00:10:36,332
or what was happening
on Tier Four in Seattle.

139
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:39,831
They were fucking disappearing people.

140
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,084
Do you understand?

141
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:42,307
Yeah, I understand, man.

142
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:44,149
People are disappearing
every fucking day out here.

143
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:45,610
Garrett's gone, Mason's gone...

144
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:48,625
The only thing that I
can do to help anyone...

145
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,058
is just go away.

146
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,764
Go away. All right?

147
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:55,653
Go as far away as you can,
where no one will find you.

148
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:57,501
- Just go?
- Yeah.

149
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:00,022
Has that always been your
plan? Just to run away?

150
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,397
Until what?

151
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:03,317
They find us?

152
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:05,211
Bring us back and put us in Tier Four?

153
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:06,672
Or give us to the Russians?

154
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:08,521
Or do whatever the fuck they want?

155
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:12,375
Tell me. Has this always
been your fucking plan?

156
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,621
There's people out here that
don't know what the fuck to do.

157
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,378
That's on you, man.

158
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:24,255
Maybe-maybe we can take them down.

159
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:26,591
Yeah, maybe-maybe if-if...

160
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:30,419
if we get a lawyer,
and we go to the press,

161
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:32,098
they'll go over there
and fucking take them out.

162
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:34,759
Look, man, you abducted
us and you abandoned us,

163
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:37,665
and now we're in the most terrible
situation I could even think of...

164
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,817
there's people out here
trying to kill us...

165
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,488
and they're probably going to.

166
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:15,974
Hello?

167
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:19,298
We're gonna be checking out.

168
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:28,487
God!

169
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:34,839
Agatha!

170
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,355
Agatha!

171
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:39,180
Agatha!

172
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,793
Fuck.
