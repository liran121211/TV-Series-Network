I've come a long way.

101
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,907
There was a time when I wouldn't even

102
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,376
-sleep out for one night.
-Think about it. Mm-hmm.

103
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,848
Because it's a new relationship
where I'm not ready to mix the two worlds,

104
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,753
going on a trip and going out of town
is, like, the easiest way

105
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,856
to keep my two worlds separate right now.

106
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,526
[Khloé] Me and Mase will have,
you know, older kid time.

-Okay.
-[Khloé] What's wrong with you?

115
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:39,479
-You're just a nitpicker. What?
-There's a lot. A lot wrong with me.

116
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,181

next to these big couches?

went off on Rob in our group text?

Listen, there's a plus and a minus.

One of the plus of all this,

132
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,660
there's no way Rob and Chyna
could get back together after this, right?

133
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,661
[Kim] Totally.

134
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,964
-Let's focus on the positive.
-[Kim] Yeah.

135
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:36,936
The negative is
all of this other [bleep] right now.

136
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:42,041
The negative is just that, like,
as Rob having sisters,

137
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,042
he should just know better

138
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,444
-and he could've just, like...
-Totally.

139
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,312
...he should've, just, like,
controlled himself.

140
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,282
So, Rob and Chyna
have officially broken up,

141
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,218
but they obviously still have
to communicate

142
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,220
for the custody of Dream.

143
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,290
But, you know what, they're still having
a hard time getting along.

144
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,859
The legal battle that has been going on
between the two of them

145
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,260
has been super frustrating.

00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,160
What?

170
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,095
[tense music]

171
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,230
[Kris] I really feel bad for Kylie

172
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:15,701
because there's always somebody that's
trying to exploit a certain situation.

173
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:21,073
And to have somebody in her own home
trying to snap pictures

174
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,778
they shouldn't be snapping,
is really, really stressful.

175
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,681
[Kris] Do... Should we have her arrested?

176
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,716
Where's your security?

177
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,918
Where... where is she?

178
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,089
[Kris] You want to be able to trust
the people that you're surrounded by,

179
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:43,196
but you really... I mean, we have
to really be on alert at all times.

180
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,965
And that's extremely upsetting

181
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,867
-when you can't feel like...
-It's so crazy.

182
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,936
...you can be in your own bathroom
or your own bedroom.

183
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,406
I just... This day.

184
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,774
[laughs]

185
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,509
Uh...
[sighs]

186
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,577
Um...

00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,682
{\an8}[upbeat music]

188
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,723
{\an8}[Kourtney] I don't think it's good for me
to be out in the sun.

189
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:12,825
-[Khloé] Why?
-So...

190
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,293
-Do you wanna sit under there?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

191
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,362
I just can't sit out here and melt away.

192
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,966
[Khloé] Do you know what's going on
with Rob with custody?

193
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,200
[Kourtney] I don't know.

194
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,402
[Khloé] Me neither.
I should call and ask him.

195
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,606
Um, I like these little... pots.

196
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,040
-Thank you.
-[line ringing]

197
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,742
{\an8}-[Rob] <i>Yo.</i>
-[Khloé] Hey, Bob.

198
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,310
{\an8}I'm with Kourt. What are you doing?

199
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,412
<i>Just at my house, about to shower.</i>

200
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,413
Hey, Bob.

201
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,415
Is Dream coming over today?

202
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,383
[Rob] <i>Hey, Kourt.</i>

203
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,918
<i>Yeah, she's going to Kourtney's house,</i>

204
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,654
<i>and then after,
she's going to stop by your house.</i>

205
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,588
Okay.

206
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,994
Um... What's going on with, like,
your custody with her?

207
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,829
[Rob] <i>Nothing's going on.</i>

208
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,731
[Khloé] Nothing happened from that day?

209
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,967
[Rob] <i>No. After, like,
an eight-hour mediation day</i>

210
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,836
<i>of nothing being resolved.</i>

211
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,605
Well, that's crazy,
and I'm sorry you have to go through that.

212
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,874
[dramatic music]

213
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:07,079
I know this is super hard for Rob
because he was so in love with that girl,

214
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:11,717
and this is definitely not the way
he thought his relationship was gonna end.

215
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:15,254
Unfortunately, this has been really hard
on my mom as well.

216
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,424
You know, she loves her kids
with everything that she has.

217
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,960
So, any stress or burden
that any of us have,

218
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,461
she carries it on times ten.

219
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,231
-I'm sorry, Rob.
-[Rob] <i>It's okay.</i>

220
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,267
[Khloé] Well, as long as Dream's okay.

221
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,269
[Rob] <i>Hold on. Hrush is calling me.</i>

222
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,305
<i>I gotta go to the Armenian deli.
I'll call you back.</i>

223
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,472
-[Kourtney] Okay, bye.
-Bye.

224
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,775
All right, you know what?

225
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,910
What, Kourt?

226
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,912
You with the furry slide?

227
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,648
-[Kourtney] I never could've dreamt it.
-[Khloé laughs]

Listen. You with the [bleep]...

Body outfit on?

230
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,689
[Khloé] Yeah, like, where the [bleep]
are you going?

[upbeat music]

232
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,498
{\an8}Here, Reign, go under the tunnel.

233
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,634
[Penelope] Reign, go under the tunnel!

234
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:03,869
[Khloé] Turn it around.

235
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,872
Reign, go. Go in there.

236
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,275
[scoffs]
Show him.

[Khloé] Reign, look!

238
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,312
Like that. Come.

239
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,247
[Khloé] All right.

240
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,284
[Kourtney] I'm having second thoughts
about going now.

241
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,852
-[Khloé] Why?
-Come on down.

242
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,754
[Kourtney] I want to put the kids to bed.

243
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,423
-Reignoosh!
-Yeah, but they're just gonna go to bed.

244
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,325
-Thank you.
-[Khloé] Ah, she went through on her own.

245
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,728
Yeah, but bedtime
is one of my favorite times.

246
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,895

00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,197
-doing lullabies.
-[Khloé] Kourt.

-Putting on the night light.
-It's one night.

249
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,300
[Khloé] I think you need
to enjoy yourself.

250
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,234
It's just church.

251
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,435
[Khloé] The kids are with me.

252
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,770
It's not that big of a deal.

253
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,942
I try to go to church once a week,

254
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,945
and that's one of the things
that I do for myself,

255
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,081
but I don't like missing, you know,

256
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,184
bedtime and bath time
and all the special moments.

257
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,387
Like, I try to be there as much as I can.

258
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,657
I just feel like,
because I'm leaving town,

259
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,926
I really just don't know
if I should be going tonight.

260
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,763
[Khloé] Cut the cord, Kourt. Right, Mase?

261
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,131
Tell her to cut the cord.

262
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,933
-Are you gonna be okay?
-[Khloé] He's like, "Duh."

-[Khloé] Yeah.

-It's either that, or my... Oh.
-It's an antique mirror.

You're just stressed out.

295
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,283
It's stressful
because at the end of the day,

you know, I'm trying
to help him navigate this

297

because he's never gone through
anything like this before.

298
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,893
I mean, I totally get that
it feels like it's pouring,

299

and all this [bleep] is happening,
but you can't let it consume you,

smile and still enjoy life.

Like, you can't let these things
just ruin your day

00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,439
or make you feel this overwhelmed
and stressed out.

303
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,540
Yeah.

304
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,075

No, you don't have to think some...
You don't think that's funny.

there's so much on her plate.

cracking and crumbling.

to filter through all this bull[bleep].

she's all about business.

What does she have to do?
She's in, she's out.

and a little more dark,

00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,754
and I just want her to get back
to her old awesome self.

336
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,190
-[Kourtney] Honey Bun Buns.
-[Khloé] You're free!

337
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,027
I know you don't watch a lot of TV,
but do you ever watch, like, prank shows?

338
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,296
Prank shows? No.

339
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,199
-Just, like...
-You know I don't watch television at all.

340
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,068
-Well, anyway.
-I don't.

341
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,370
I watched this show. It's a prank show.

342
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,405
It's called <i>Impractical Jokers</i>,

343
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:37,243
and it's, like, these four guys
who've been, like, best friends forever.

344
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,646
The premise of the show is, they basically
have to, like, humiliate each other.

345
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,249
-So, anyway, one of the punishments was...
-[Kourtney] Honey?

346
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,887
...that this guy had to be handcuffed
to a mime for 24 hours,

347
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:53,592
and I just thought, what an obnoxious,
fabulous prank is this to do to Mom.

348
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,960
-[Kourtney] Get a mime?
-[mumbles]

349
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,028
The mime.

350
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,363
I want this...

351
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,697
I've never seen a mime...

352
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:02,101
-You want the same mime from the show?
-...be this legendary. Yes.

353
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,673
I've already reached out to his manager,
and he's so down for this.

354
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,175
He doesn't speak on the phone,
only through management.

355
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,477
Love him even more.

356
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,346
And he's so excited
to have a fun day with my mom.

357
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,383
And hopefully, he could break her
out of her stiff funk.

358
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,451
Don't tell her the plan.

359
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:22,021
No, you moron,
we're showing up with the mime.

360
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,658
Oh, what... I think you should just, like,
say we're having dinner

361
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,294
and we have a special guest
that we want her to meet.

362
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,895
And then just handcuff them?

363
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,665
But what? Is she gonna...
Why would she agree to have a mime...

364
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,433
She's not gonna agree. We just do it.

365
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,901
When would she agree to any of this?

366
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,037
-She takes herself too seriously.
-So, what, do we say

367
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,772
there's a guest at the door?

368
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,040
We got to figure that part out.

369
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,209
We're just gonna be like,
"Yo, you take yourself so seriously,

370
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,744
and, like, let's have fun."

371
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,380
I think this is just...
I mean, she'll definitely kill us.

372
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,581
Well, whoever's affiliated.

373
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,983
Me, most likely.

374
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,152
[Khloé] It's just, like, fun
to [bleep] with her.

375
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,055
Oh, yeah.

376
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,490
-[Kourtney] My guard dog.
-[barking]

377
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,059
[Khloé] Get it, Honey.

378
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,161
[upbeat music]

379
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,029
[high-pitched]
Love you, Mom.

380
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,497
Love you, too, Kimmy.

381
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,865
I don't know.

382
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,170
{\an8}[Khloé] Oh, my gosh.

383
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,939
You just wanna be free!

384
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,642
[Khloé] Oh, she's such a cute dog.

385
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,477
[phone chiming]

386
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,212
[Kourtney] Chonch.

387
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,515
{\an8}-[Cici] <i>Hi! How are you?</i>
-[Kourtney] Hi!

388
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,886
{\an8}-<i>Hi! What are you doing?</i>
-[Kourtney] I'm sitting here with Khloé.

389
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,990
-<i>How are you?</i>
-[Khloé] I'm good. How are you?

390
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,658
[Kourtney] How are you feeling?

391
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,526
<i>Mm, better, thank you.</i>

392
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,594
[Kourtney] Good.

393
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,496
<i>So, what's new?</i>

394
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,599
[Kourtney] I'm going on a trip.

395
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,800
<i>Okay. Where?</i>

396
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:42,835
[Kourtney] To Egypt.

397
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,804
<i>Okay. Would the kids go on the trip?</i>

398
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,175
No, I was just gonna go
with Simon and my friends.

399
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,748
-<i>Well, for how long?</i>
-For, like, seven days.

400
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,083
<i>That's a long time.</i>

401
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,918
Yeah. It is.

402
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,322
<i>You don't want them to always think
you're getting up and going.</i>

403
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,493
No. Especially since I didn't
for so long, you know?

404
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,030
<i>Right. But that's probably what,</i>

405
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:14,566
<i>you know, helps them keep grounded,
is that you are there.</i>

406
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,236
<i>And even though you work
and they know that,</i>

407
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,370
<i>you know, you're there.</i>

408
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,773
<i>But when you're not there, it's a void.</i>

409
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,276
<i>And you don't want them,
at a young age, to feel a void.</i>

410
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,311
Yeah.

411
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,681
<i>You know, our greatest gift</i>

412
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:35,487
<i>is our stability from our family
is our togetherness and the presence</i>

413
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,990
-<i>that gives us our strength.</i>
-And I think it's frustrating to me

414
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,392
to have my co-parenting partner

415
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,863
who's not, like, you know, fully reliable.

416
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,600
<i>Yeah, no, of course, it is,
'cause your children,</i>

417
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,103
<i>you know, are the most important things
in your life.</i>

418
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,241
<i>Uh, I think you should stay at home.</i>

419
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,647
I already feel like
I'm having separation anxiety

420
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,849
when it comes to leaving my kids,

421
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,787
and Cici is making the situation worse.

422
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,057
All right. Well...

423
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,859
[Cici] <i>Keep me posted.</i>

424
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,029
Okay. I'll call you later.

425
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,098
-<i>Okay. Love you.</i>
-[Kourtney] Love you, bye.

426
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,966
-<i>Bye, Khlo. Love you.</i>
-Bye. Love you.

427
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,071
[upbeat music]

428
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,413
{\an8}-[Kourtney] Hi!
-[Kendall] Hi!

429
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,049
[Kourtney] Here, let me just show.
Look, for my lip kit.

430
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,285
The package would be this little box.

431
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,355
And it has... one of our colors
is, like, a true, true red,

432
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,891
not orangy red, like, a good fall red.

433
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,094
And it's red kisses all over it,
but they're wet-looking.

434
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,329
-Is that cute?
-Yeah.

435
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,731
It's really the only option
for right now if I want to do it.

436
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,366
-Listen, listen, listen!
-What?

437
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,070
So, I need you to stay here,
and you can't leave the kitchen.

438
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,539
-[Khloé] Stay with Kylie and Kourtney.
-[Kris] Why?

439
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,841
-'Cause I said. You got to do me a favor.
-[Kris] Okay.

440
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,114
[quirky music]

441
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,721
[Khloé gasps]
Pierre, come here.

442
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,790
{\an8}I'm so excited.

443
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,527
I know you can't talk to me.

444
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,928
Ooh, thank you.

445
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,596
[Khloé laughs]

446
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:30,102
Being handcuffed to this mime
is exactly what my mom needs to get going.

447
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,237
I think this is a pretty genius idea.

448
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,677
Mommy, this is your friend, Pierre.

449
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,979
[Kris] Oh! Hi...
[laughs]

450
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,282
-What? What?
-[Khloé] Come here, Pierre.

451
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,185
[Kris] Hi, Pierre. How are you?

452
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,519
-This is Pierre.
-Who's Pierre?

453
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,054
What's this?

454
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,124
[Khloé] This is a fun little bracelet
that I got you.

455
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,961
-Do not take it off for now. No, no.
-I don't like how it is starting to feel.

456
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,963
What's going on, Pierre?

457
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,265
Oh, so cute.

458
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,468
Wait, what's up? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

459
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,070
I don't want to be chained to anybody.

460
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,039
-Mom, it's just for a second.
-Okay.

461
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,575
-It's just for fun. Enjoy your life.
-[Khloé] It's little Pierre.

462
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,344
-Okay, I'm starting to sweat.
-Live in the moment.

463
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,213
-Okay.
-[Khloé] Ooh!

464
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,181
Don't you feel good, Pierre?

465
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,616
What's going...

466
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:21,420
So, I met Pierre on a TV show
called <i>Impractical Jokers</i>,

467
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,990
and he was chained to someone
for 24 hours.

468
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:27,993
Yeah.

469
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,363
So, Pierre doesn't talk or anything.
He's fine.

470
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,332
[Khloé] Look, he's talking to you.

471
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,100
Here, it's... it's his friend.

472
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,202
Hello. I'll call you back later.

473
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,571
-Yeah. Just really busy.
-[line ringing]

474
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,506
{\an8}Look at our friend, Pierre.

475
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,242
{\an8}[Kim] <i>Oh, hi!</i>

476
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,010
<i>You're talking to the clown guy!</i>

477
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,645
He's not a clown.

478
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:47,980
Look how mad he is!

479
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,983
[Kim] <i>Oh, he's mad at me, Northie.
I think he's called a meme.</i>

480
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,951
A mime, not a meme!

481
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,586
<i>Oh, my gosh, Northie!</i>

482
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,788
-<i>It's a mi... a mime?</i>
-[Khloé] A mime.

483
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,724
-We wish you were here.
-[Kim] <i>Yeah.</i>

484
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,360
-Stop it.
-[Khloé] Okay. Love you. Bye.

485
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,861
Let's go make a martini.

486
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,029
Come to the bar.

487
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,030
Mom, come on.

488
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,833
-I don't want any alcohol.
-Yes, you do.

489
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,269
Matthew.
[laughing]

490
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,238
-What is Matthew gonna do to you?
-[Kris] I don't know.

491
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,040
And I have the only key.

492
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,042
Oh, my god.

493
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,279
-You guys, I'm gonna kill you.
-Hey, Mom, make a martini for Pierre.

494
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,615
-No, I don't want to make a martini.
-Yes, I need to see you do things.

495
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,117
-[Kris] Khloé.
-[Khloé] Okay.

496
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,320
What... No, thank you. I'm trying to quit.

497
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,155
Let's open the vodka.

498
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,724
[indistinct chatter]

499
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,726
-[laughing]
-[Kris] Oh, my god, help me.

500
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,996
-[Khloé] Take him to the party tonight.
-[Kourtney] What party are you going to?

501
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,198
Victoria Jackson's birthday party.

502
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,199
-Oh...
-[Khloé] Mom, he's...

503
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,068
Oh, look at him. He's so excited.

504
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,604
All right, Pierre.
You could shake this up.

505
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,572
You shake it. He's not your assistant.

506
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,207
[laughing]

507
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,343
-[Kris] There we go.
-[Khloé] Only one?

508
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,477
[Kris] We're sharing.

509
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:53,912
Oh, look at us.

510
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,614
Aw!

511
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,483
-[Khloé] You guys are so cute.
-[Kourtney] So, cute.

512
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,419
[Khloé laughing]

513
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,255
-[Kris] I really have to pee.
-[Khloé] Okay.

514
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,823
[Kris] Come on, Pierre.

515
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,191
-I love you.
-[Kris] Mm-hmm.

516
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,392
You have to come with me.

517
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,728
[Khloé] Okay. Wait, you're afraid
to have him alone?

518
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,229
-[Kris] All right.
-[laughs]

519
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,931
Okay. Okay.

520
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,199
Come over here.

521
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,903
-[Kris] Okay.
-[Khloé] You're fine right there.

522
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,772
-[knocking on door]
-[Kris] Okay, no.

523
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,074
He's not coming in.

524
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:24,743
[laughs]

525
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,978
[Khloé] Mom, are you taking
a deuce in there?

526
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,780
[Kris] I'm just peeing.

527
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,916
I can't even get the toilet paper.

528
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,552
That's not toilet paper.

529
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,089
-[Kris] Oh, man.
-[Khloé] What's happening in there?

530
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,990
[Kris] It's just all over the place.

531
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:42,828
[Khloé] I don't think my mom knows
what is going on at all.

532
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,663
My mom's frustrated,
but she'll get over it.

533
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,399
You can't help
but fall in love with Pierre.

534
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,900
I mean, I love Pierre.

535
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,236
-[toilet flushes]
-[Khloé] Yay!

536
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,338
[Kris] Okay. All right. Let's go.

537
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,573
I'm so sorry, Pierre.

538
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,607
[Kris laughs]

539
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,344
[Khloé] I'm probably gonna leave
'cause I have a few things to do.

540
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,913
[Kris] Wait, leave? Where's the key?

541
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,482
[Khloé] The key I flushed down the toilet.

542
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,783
-Yeah, Mom.
-[Kris] No.

543
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,884
-[Khloé] I just feel like sometimes...
-No.

544
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,018
...you're so uptight.

545
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,720
Let's just have fun.

546
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,790
Remember, this is all the beauty of life.

547
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:12,991
[Khloé] Right?

548
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,126
-[laughing]
-What is that?

549
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,394
-Okay.
-[Khloé] Bye, Mom.

550
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,795
-Oh, my god.
-[Khloé] Have fun.

551
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,530
-All right. Where's the key?
-[door closes]

552
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,567
I know Khloé wants me to lighten up
and I get what she's trying to do,

553
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:27,539
but I don't think she understands
how packed my day is.

554
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,642
You're a good sport.
I would not have done that.

555
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,346
No.

556
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,182
[upbeat music]

557
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,021
[Kris] Here we go.

558
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,389
Off to the market.

559
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:47,993
[music stops]

560
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,233
No.
[laughs]

561
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,536
You're, like, mischievous.

562
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,838
[upbeat music]

563
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,139
[groans]

564
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,643
I don't have time
to play with the mime today.

565
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,012
Yeah, I don't know
where she came up with this idea.

566
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,614
[Kris] We're here. Yay!

567
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,783
Hi, P.

568
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,986
Let's go find some snacks.

569
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,055
[playful music]

570
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,258
[Kris] Nope, nope, no. Don't you dare.

571
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,727
Don't you dare.

572
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,162
Don't you dare.

573
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,363
Don't you...
[laughs]

574
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,933
[Kourtney] Have you ever talked this much
with someone

575
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,334
-who doesn't talk back?
-[Kris] No, I'm exhausted.

576
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,436
[Kourtney] Do you want to get this?

577
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,872
[Kris] Oh, no, that's good. We're good.

578
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,607
We're good. Did you break that?

579
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,677
No. No. No. Stop that.

580
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,012
Ooh! I almost got my head taken off.

581
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,082
Oh, thank you.

582
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,951
Thank you so much.

583
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,088
-[Penelope] Lovey.
-[Kris chuckles]

584
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,758
[laughing]

585
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,028
Kourtney, will you go put this back?

586
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,196
[Kris laughs]

587
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,333
Stop it.

588
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,435
[line ringing]

589
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,538
Khloé, answer the phone.

590
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,207
Oh, my god.

591
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,243
We're gonna get kicked out of the market.

592
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,678
-[Kourtney] Who are you calling?
-[Kris] Khloé. I want my key.

593
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,347
-[Kourtney] She has it?
-[Kris] Yeah, but...

594
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,049
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

595
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,084
[Kris] No, no, no.

596
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,987
No, no, that's not for sale.

597
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,688
[Kris] It's called a ladder.

598
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,092
[laughing]

599
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,261
Oh, my god.

600
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,629
[Kourtney]
He's balancing that on his head.

601
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,397
P, help me.

602
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,699
[Kris laughing]

603
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,434
[Kourtney] How does he know
how to do that?

604
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,103
[Kris] That was very good.
[claps]

605
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,739
Very good. No, we don't want to take it.

606
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:45,410
Please, just behave for 15 minutes
until we can get out of here.

607
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,746
Fifteen. Give me fifteen minutes
of good behavior,

608
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,180
and I will buy you a Popsicle.

609
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:50,916
Come on.

610
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,218
[upbeat music]

611
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,520
-[Penelope] Lovey!
-Oh. What?

612
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,655
[Penelope] He opened those!

613
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,857
I know. He likes white gloves.

614
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,258
It's his thing.

615
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,294
[Kris] I just had to surrender.

616
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,297
Pierre was never going to give up.

617
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,898
He has more energy

618
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,567
than you can ever imagine,

619
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,536
and he wasn't getting tired anytime soon.

620
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,538
-[Kris] Hi.
-[clerk] Hi, how are you?

621
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,041
[Kris] Good, how are you?
Okay, we... we have that.

622
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,042
We have...

623
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,077
You know, we don't want that.

624
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,280
Okay, you have to get off
the basket for a second.

625
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,750
-[Kris] Take those.
-[Kourtney] Mom, do you need this?

626
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,653
[Kris] Yeah. Do we have one of those,
uh, blue collagen tubs?

627
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,890
-[clerk] Yeah, we do.
-Okay, no, no, no, no.

628
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,326
[Kris] No. No. Get down right now.

629
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:37,729
This is... You are gonna be
in so much trouble. Get down.

630
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:41,099
[Kris] Kourtney, tell him to get down.
Okay, come on.

631
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,667
Get off the counter.

632
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,204
Okay, no, no, no, no.

633
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,405
No, get down.

634
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,407
Get down right now. I...

635
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,976
Where's Khloé with my key?

636
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,944
[Kris] Thank you so much.
Here's your gloves.

637
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,013
Put your gloves on. Let's go. Come on.

638
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,615
-Have a good day, guys.
-[Kris] Thank you.

639
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,984
[line ringing]

640
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,319
[Kris] Khloé. I want my key.

641
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,155
I'm exhausted.

642
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:05,256
Thank you.

643
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,392
[Kris groans]

644
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,361
Wild!

645
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,230
Put your... Stop it.

646
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,765
[Kris] Put your seat belt on.

647
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,768
I literally need to take a shower
after that.

648
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,774
[laughing]

649
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,843
[Kris laughs]

650
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,781
{\an8}-[Kris] Jenna.
-[Jenna] Yes?

651
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,416
[Kris] Can you bring me some scissors?

652
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,385
[quirky music]

653
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,721
{\an8}-Can you see if you can cut this?
-There is no way.

654
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,390
{\an8}Cut this.
[soft chuckle]

655
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,457
How about...

656
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:40,759
No. He's gonna steal.

657
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,395
You cannot steal the scissors.
What are you doing?

658
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:46,898
[Jenna] Oh.

659
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,733
[Kris laughing]

660
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,736
[laughing continues]

661
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,805
Now, I feel kind of bad.

662
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,875
It's okay.
[laughing]

663
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,110
[somber music]

664
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,345
It's...

665
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,813
Okay, here's your...

666
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,081
Here's your little thing.

667
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,183
Okay.

668
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,886
I don't... I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

669
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,988
It's just that I have to go.

670
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,357
Okay?

671
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,963
[Kris] By the end of the day,
I... I've got to say,

672
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,132
it was really fun.

673
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,535
It was the best remedy for stress?

674
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,004
I've never laughed so hard
in my whole life.

675
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,772
It was nice to meet you.

676
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,974
Okay? I wanna... Oh.

677
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,044
Oh.
[laughing]

678
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,480
[laughing continues]

679
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,249
[upbeat music]

680
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:52,664
So, I think we're done with the thing.

681
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,668
She's gonna sign whatever
the family law agreement,

682
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,770
so for custody and...

683
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,972
-Good. What's the...
-...payments and stuff like that.

684
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,141
So I'll just be glad
when this is behind him.

685
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,711
Him and I had a really good talk,

686
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,780
I mean, just in general about everything,

687
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:13,084
and just where he wants to,
like, see his life.

688
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,253
[Khloé] With Rob, when he loves,
he loves hard.

689
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,588
Yeah.

690
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,556
He would kind of do anything for her.

691
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,391
A hundred percent.

692
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,460
A lot of us are impulsive
when we do things,

693
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,196
and especially out of, like,
love and jealousy.

694
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,531
[Khloé] We've all been there.

695
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,501
He knows it was wrong, what he's done.

696
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,337
I think he's learned
a lot of lessons from this.

697
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,506
Even though this has been a rollercoaster,

698
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:38,443
I'm really proud of Rob for being able
to handle all of this really maturely.

699
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:43,448
[Khloé] Now that the custody is settled,
Rob can start fresh and move on from this.

700
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:47,152
Rob is definitely an awesome dad to Dream,

701
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,687
and I hope he just takes
these life experiences

702
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,657
and becomes better and better
as he gets older.

703
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,160
I'm sure this will be a weight lifted off
of his shoulders

704
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,528
once these papers are signed.

705
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,965
Um, just the end to a really bad chapter.

706
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,435
Well, it could only get better
from here, right?

707
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:05,937
[Kris] That's right. Yay.

708
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:12,076
-So, Pierre... he's really funny.
-You didn't love him?

709
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,879
Oh, I'm to... I am kind of
have a crush on Pierre.

710
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,548
Is he not amazing?

711
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:17,649
He's life.

712
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,051
No, seriously,
you'll never forget that day.

713
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,920
-Uh, no, I won't.
-[Khloé] No.

714
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,723
And I'll never, ever find something

715
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,360
that's enough to repay you,
or thank you for that.

716
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,229
I could only imagine.

717
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,530
[laughs]

718
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,902
[upbeat music]

719
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,240
{\an8}[Kourtney] Penelope!

720
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,241
Yeah.

721
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,110
-[Kourtney] There she is.
-[Larsa] Hey.

722
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,413
-[Kourtney] Is there money in here?
-Yeah.

723
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,881
Oh, am I gonna be rich?

724
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,082
{\an8}It's heavy.

725
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,284
{\an8}[Kourtney] Ooh, my goodness!

726
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,720
-This is all your money?
-[Penelope] Mm-hmm.

727
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,788
Wow.

728
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,656
[Larsa] Well, P, you've been saving up.

729
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,325
You've been saving.

730
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,492
[Penelope] Mm-hmm.

731
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,597
Um... So, I think I'm gonna flake
on dinner tonight.

732
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,498
You flaked on dinner last night.

733
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,301
-I flaked on you all week, but...
-[Larsa] I know.

734
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,637
[Kourtney]
I just want to hang out with the kids.

735
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,505
Why... Wait, why are you changing your mind?

736
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,041
I'm tired, but I also get,
like, mom guilt.

737
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,410
Like, I was talking to Cici,

738
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,046
and I was telling her,
like, I might leave town.

739
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:26,251
She was like, "You can't go away again.

740
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:30,555
Like, when you're a parent, you have to be
a parent, and that's your first priority."

741
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,192
But I feel like your kids are good.
You're with them all day.

742
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,493
And your kids don't go to camp.

743
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,629
Like, you're the camp counselor all day.

744
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,298
[Kourtney] Yeah. But after talking to her,

745
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,101
she was, like, re-instilling,
like, the mom guilt.

746
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,370
[Larsa] I think every mom feels guilt
at some point.

747
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,572
Of course, there are gonna be
some bumps along the road,

748
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:48,606
like you're feeling now.

749
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:53,278
It's, like, a lot to balance, like, work,
being a mom, and being social.

750
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,914
[Larsa] It is.
But I feel like you have to, like...

751
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,516
You have to live and be present,
you know what I mean?

752
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,453
[Kourtney] I have realized in life
that I need the balance.

753
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,956
-That's what it is managing your time.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

754
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,525
Spend quality time with them
and be present when you're with them,

755
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,694
and then you won't feel guilty
when you're not.

756
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:17,268
It is hard to balance being
in a relationship, work, and my children.

757
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,072
I just think that it's really important
for me to be there for them,

758
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:25,276
and... even though, like, I want to go away

759
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:29,847
and travel and do things for myself,
it's hard to find the balance

760
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:33,217
of allowing myself to do that
and not feel guilty.

761
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,021
[Larsa] You can't listen to Cici.
You got to listen to someone like me,

762
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,957
who's got four kids
and everything going on.

763
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,158
[Kourtney] Yeah.

764
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,330
{\an8}[upbeat music]

765
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,171
{\an8}Why are you gonna have
your shirt on today?

766
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,872
It's more motivating for me
when you don't.

767
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,775
{\an8}We could start with the shirt on.
And when we get a little hot, you know...

768
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:58,710
[Khloé] Take it off.

769
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,877
I like it off.

770

Be like your personal, like,

00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,147

00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,684
[Tristan] What up? What's up?

774
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,087
-Yo, you knocked out early.
-[Rob] I know.

775
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,555
[Tristan] You went to sleep early.

776
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,857
[Rob] I left the house at, like, 5:30.

777
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,525
[Tristan] What time was the appointment?

778
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,527
[Rob] Uh, 7:30, I had to be there,

779
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,796
-but... it's fine.
-[Tristan] Yeah.

780
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,331
[Rob] It's just annoying.

781
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,333
[Khloé] What is that appointment for?

782
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,103
[Rob] Uh, just a checkup
to do blood work and stuff.

783
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,771
I'm happy you're doing that.

784
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,172
That's really positive.

785
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,943
[Rob] Yeah. If you don't see the doctor,
you can't get medicine.

786
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,877
Insulin?

787
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,747
[Rob] And then I start to feel [bleep].

788
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,715
But one day, you could stop taking it?

789
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,020
[Rob] Yeah, I just got to be on it,
work out, eat well,

790
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,254
and that [bleep] will go away.

791
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,823
I am so proud of Rob,

792
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,859
and I really hope
he can just take our talk

793
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,794
and put everything into action

794
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,829
and just focus on bettering himself.

795
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,532
[Khloé] And, hopefully,
everything else will just fall into place.

796
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,702
Rob has always been super sensitive
and emotional,

797
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,638
and I know this entire experience
has been really hard on him.

798
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,609
But just, like, seeing him with Dream
and seeing him be such a great dad,

799
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,911
I really just hope he stays
on this path right now.

837
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,162
'cause I love me a double dose
of Kris Jenner.

838
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,796
[Khloé] Hold on. Let's show Tristan.

839
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,899
Babe, look at this.

840
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,635
-Oh, my god.
-[Khloé laughing]

841
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,503
[Tristan laughs]

842
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,040
Oh, my gosh.

843
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,542
What?

844
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,745
[knocking on door]

845
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:21,812
Hold on.

846
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,448
That's your mom?

847
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,650
-Oh.
-[Khloé] This is my mom.

848
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,552
Oh, sh... I... Oh, my god. I thought it was...

849
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,520
-[Tristan] I thought it... I kept looking.
-Who'd you... think this was?

850
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,122
I was like, "Hold on. Looks familiar."

851
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,357
And then you saw her ass
and knew it was her?

852
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,127
I mean, it runs in the family.

853
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,228
[Kris laughs]

854
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,429
You can't laugh.

855
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,931
[laughs]
That was epic.

856
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:40,965
Oh, my gosh.

857
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,303
[Khloé] Why didn't you get me
long handcuffs, like I got you?

858
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,139
There you go.

859
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,142
Mom, this is really your look.

860
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,077
I think you should do this all the time.

861
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,378
Oh, where are you going?

862
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,013
You have to pee?

863
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,984
[quirky music]

864
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,354
Oh, [bleep].

865
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,622
Are you okay?

866
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,591
[Khloé] It fell.

867
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,592
It broke.

868
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:12,196
I am so happy to see my mom
as this light, fun Kris Jenner.

869
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,298
This is the Kris Jenner that I know.

870
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,334
So, the next time things get crazy,

871
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,769
pull out that face paint
and your mime costume.

872
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,937
You're good to go.

873
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,775
[Khloé laughs]

874
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,278
Mom, what are you doing?

875
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,913
[Khloé] It looks like you're having sex.

876
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,214
I can't figure it out.

877
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,017
Oh, okay.

878
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,421
Thank you.

879
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,058
I'm gonna go.

880
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,895
[Khloé] Anyways, this was fun.

881
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,165
[upbeat music]

882
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,571
{\an8}[Kris] Hello.

883
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,006
[Reign] Hi, Lovey.

884
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,475
[Kris] Hi. Oh, it's so dark in here.

885
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,145
Hey! Jeez.

886
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,513
[indistinct chatter]

887
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,616
-[Kris] This is such a great room.
-[Scott] Yeah, it's really cool.

888
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,352
Hi, Reigny. Where's P?

889
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,088
[Scott] Playing with her dolls
in the other room.

890
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,990
Kourtney decided to go to Egypt,

891
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,794
so our entire family is rotating turns
taking care of the kids.

892
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:19,463
[Kris] Today is Scott's day,
and the kids are with him.

893
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,666
So I'm just gonna check in
and see how they're doing.

894
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,501
[line ringing]

895
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,705
{\an8}-[Kourtney] <i>Hey, Mom?</i>
-Hi! How are you?

896
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,107
{\an8}<i>I'm good. How are you?</i>

897
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:34,312
Good. It must be very late
over there in Egypt.

898
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:36,580
<i>It's very late.</i>

899
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,082
Oh. I don't even...

900
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,917
I can't even keep up with you.

901
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,920
I just wanted to make sure you were okay
and you're having a good time.

902
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,556
<i>I am having the best time.</i>

903
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,559
Everything,
the pictures look so beautiful.

904
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:52,096
I can't even imagine what it would be like
to be inside of a pyramid.

905
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,232
<i>So insane.</i>

906
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,334
Right?

907
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:01,872
I've definitely learned from,
you know, my past relationship,

908
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,942
where I really wouldn't travel
without the kids.

909
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,878
And I think it is important to take time,

910
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:11,816
especially because my relationship
is important to me,

911
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,885
and just because those worlds
aren't colliding right now,

912
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:19,590
just making sure
that I make time for both.

913
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,728
And I think going on a trip,
once in a while,

914
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:29,667
reminds me the importance of being present
and in the moment when I'm home.

915
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:33,938
And I think it makes me the best mom
that I can be.

916
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,241
[Kourtney] <i>Reigny-Reignoosh.</i>

917
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,076
[gasps]
<i>Yummy.</i>

918
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,511
[Kris] Wait!

919
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,880
P! Here's this one.

920
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,248
Hi, Mom.

921
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,916
[Kourtney] <i>You look so beautiful.</i>

922
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,685
{\an8}[Penelope] Love you.

923
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:49,820
{\an8}<i>I love you guys.</i>

924
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,222
Love you, Kourt.

925
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,493
{\an8}[Kim] <i>On the next episode...</i>

926
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,928
{\an8}'Cause I have the biggest earlobes
in the universe.

927
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:02,433
{\an8}I have made a decision
to do something about my ears.

928
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,201
{\an8}[Kris] Oh, my gosh.

929
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,505
{\an8}Corey was doing anything in his power
to avoid me.

930
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,108
{\an8}If that energy is out there,
it's not okay with me.

931
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,544
{\an8}I'm a young dude dating your mom.

932
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,446
{\an8}Y'all are not my [bleep] kids.

933
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,848
{\an8}[Tristan] Thank you guys for all coming.

934
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,817
{\an8}We have an announcement. KoKo?

935
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,753
