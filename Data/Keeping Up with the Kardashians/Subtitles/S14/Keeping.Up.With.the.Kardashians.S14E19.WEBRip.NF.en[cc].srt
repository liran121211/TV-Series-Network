{\an8}[Kim] <i>Previously on</i>
Keeping Up with the Kardashians...

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,076
{\an8}Oh, my God,
TMZ just got a tip that you're pregnant.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,311
{\an8}This is not fun.

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,546
{\an8}[Khloé] As soon as I get
to my second trimester,

5
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,248
{\an8}I will have such relief

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,616
{\an8}and that's all I'm waiting for.

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,818
{\an8}When I'm ready,
when there's a healthy point

8
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:20,420
{\an8}where I can say something, I will.

9
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,255
{\an8}What's going on?

10
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,691
{\an8}I'm so sick of people,
like, not saying anything.

11
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:29,262
{\an8}I really just don't want to jeopardize
my relationship with Kourtney as a friend

12
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,463
{\an8}because of our children.

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,631
{\an8}Love you, partner.

14
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,267
{\an8}I'll see you
on the business side of things.

15
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,738
{\an8}They literally have information
about the surrogate that I don't know.

16
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,006
{\an8}[attorney] <i>This [bleep] has to stop.</i>

17
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:44,644
{\an8}It's just so invasive and we'll try to do
whatever we can to stop this.

18
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,813
{\an8}Literally, sue the [bleep] out of them.

19
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,650
[theme music]

20
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,139
{\an8}Oh, hey, <i>madre</i>.

21
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,407
{\an8}-Hey.
-Hey.

22
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,743
{\an8}-Black velvet.
-Hi.

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,512
{\an8}[Kourtney] Kim, you need to invite me
next time to Chappelle's show.

24
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,713
[Kim] That was so funny.

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,148
But why didn't you invite me?

26
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,716
I told you last time to invite me.

27
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,485
'Cause Kanye said,
"I'm taking you on a date tonight."

28
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,887
-It was her date night...
-[Kim] Then we went to Nobu...

29
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,522
This is exhausting being a member

30
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,690
-of this family.
-Got it. That's cute.

31
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,692
But Eddie Murphy was sitting next to us.

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,527
It was like a whole thing.
Like, it was like a real comedy show.

33
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,830
Well, don't brag about it
if we all wanted to be there.

34
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,565
I'm just saying it was so fun.

35
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,300
[Kim] And then John Mayer came out

36
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,769
and was doing the music
for, like, all of his jokes.

37
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:43,870
And then they just, like,

38
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,271
-had this thing going...
-[Kris] Ah, wait.

39
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,408
Here.

40
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,478
You dropped another name.
[laughs]

41
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,914
I was just giving it back to you.

42
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,850
[Kourtney laughing]

43
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,751
That was a good one.

44
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,153
[chuckles]

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,755
-God, I love myself.
-[Kim] Okay. That was pretty silly.

46
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,390
Someone obviously did that to her

47
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,625
-because, you know...
-[Kim] Totally.

48
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,993
-...she's literally the queen...
-You did not make that up.

49
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,761
...of dropping names.

50
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,865
[Kris laughing]

51
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:15,935
So some magazine is publishing
a photo of my surrogate.

52
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,637
-[Khloé] Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

53
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,805
This is...

54
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,773
-It is not an easy process.
-No.

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,244
[Kim] So, now,
it's like all these security issues.

56
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,479
[Khloé] So, where is this baby being born?

57
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,915
Or you can't predict that
'cause if they just go into labor?

58
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,483
-You can't predict it.
-[Khloé] Obviously.

59
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,452
But I'm hoping to move her out here,

60
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,220
like, three weeks before.

61
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,389
But he said she might need a C-section.

62
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,092
She most likely will
'cause her placenta thing.

63
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,061
[Kim] It's been such a crazy year.

64
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,098
Our surrogate has been amazing,
but it has been challenging

65
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,967
with all of the media leaks
and on top of that,

66
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:52,605
she's having some health issues
'cause there is a placenta condition.

67
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,708
It's so crazy that we both have
these placenta issues.

68
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,611
It hurts so bad.
[crying]

69
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,848
Just to breathe, to do anything, it kills.

70
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,817
But it just feels weird
that my family really has no idea

71
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,187
what my experience has been like.

72
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,455
[Kris] This'll be the first grandchild

73
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,324
-I haven't been in the room for.
-[Kim] Well, you can come with me.

74
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,127
[Kourtney] Kim, are you going
to our cousin's birthday party?

75
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,562
Kourtney, shut up.

76
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,231
Come here for a second.
Let me smack you across the face.

77
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,066
You know, people really talk...

78
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,040
I have rings that will [bleep] throw you
to the next century.

79
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,608
No playing in the house.

80
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,646
[upbeat music]

81
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,621
-[Kourtney] Younes says hi.
-[Kim] Hi.

82
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,057
We're going to dinner. Um...

83
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,259
I love that the voice changes
when you talk to him.

84
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,795
Oh, my God,
do you want me to talk super loud?

85
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,264
No, but you just have a...
You're so nice to him.

86
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,633
You're literally the biggest bitch to us.

87
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,901
[imitates Kourtney's voice]
"Hey, guys,

88
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,504
so we're gonna go to dinner now."

89
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,773
[Kourtney] Okay, have a good night.

90
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,475
Sleep good, baby.

91
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,012
[Khloé] Look at those legs.

92
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,249
-Hi. How are you?
-[man] How are you?

93
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,385
[Kourtney] That dinner was fun at Mom's.

94
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,087
-Oh, my God, how was it?
-Oh, you weren't there.

95
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,355
I heard about it.

96
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,490
-She texts me every single day.
-I heard she... No.

97
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,758
-Jennifer Lawrence?
-I will brag.

98
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,193
I heard she loves you guys.

99
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,861
But no, she was so funny.

100
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,397
So, what do you guys want to do tonight?

101
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,566
-Mm, what are we doing tonight?
-[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

102
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,767
Is this, like, a wild night?

103
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,669
I'm gonna put my kids to bed.

104
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,970
It was just a question, Kourtney.

105
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,039
You don't have to be
so defensive about it.

106
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,276
[Khloé] I'd rather talk to you guys
than be on my phone the whole time.

107
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,577
-You know?
-Mm...

108
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,480
[Kourtney] You guys.

109
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,048
[Khloé] Yes, Kourtney?

110
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,517
Are we excited for San Francisco?

111
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,753
[Kim] I'm so excited.

112
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,057
I am excited for Alcatraz
and to sleep in a bed by myself.

113
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,126
[Kim] I have so many amazing things
that I love there

114
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,494
'cause I go there all the time.

115
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,964
Since Kim and Khloé
are both going to have babies soon,

116
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,800
we decided to plan a trip
to San Francisco.

117
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,170
I feel like there's so much
to explore there that we've never done,

118
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,705
like going to Alcatraz.

119
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,976
And it's just going to be
a fun sister trip.

120
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,211
We come back Friday.
I have to be back by 5:00.

121
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,314
What are you doing that evening?

122
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,349
My boyfriend lands at the airport.

123
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,717
I'd like to pick him up.

124
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,720
-Friday?
-[Kourtney] At LAX. Yup.

125
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,322
You are a good girlfriend.

126
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,258
I would send a driver
with a box of cookies.

127
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,459
Nope.

128
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,363
All right. Well, that's fun.

129
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,101
<i>I've never done this nose theme.</i>

130
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,671
[high-pitched squealing]

131
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,508
{\an8}Tristan's supposed to be finding me
a trainer in Cleveland

132
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,478
{\an8}and I don't think he's asked anyone yet.

133
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,146
{\an8}[Kim] You are gonna want to chill though.

134
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,881
{\an8}You could work out and it's all good,

135
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:53,052
but there is those times when you're gonna
just be like, "I can't even see my feet."

136
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,889
[Kim] Hopefully, you won't get like that,
but I'm just saying.

137
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,558
Can't you just look to the side?

138
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,993
There'll be a point
you can't put your shoe on

139
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,695
so you only have to wear slides

140
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,831
or UGGs, depending on the weather.

141
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,166
You know we're having the baby
in Cleveland.

142
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,501
-I'm gonna fly the doctor.
-[Kim] Trust me. I booked my ticket.

143
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,702
We're on our way.

144
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,703
Isn't that scary?

145
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,905
Like going to a hospital
I've never been to, like, Cedars...

146
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,240
[Tristan]
Oh, no, you're going there before,

147
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,475
it's not gonna be
your first time going there.

148
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,577
-No, but, like, Cedars, I can...
-Ah! Like, your leg up in the air.

149
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,778
Yeah, that's usually what happens.

150
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,480
Yeah, what am I gonna do?
Visit the hospital prior?

151
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,749
Yeah, visit it. Gonna see what room
y'all gonna put me in.

152
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,584
[Khloé] Yeah, we're gonna need a tour.

153
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,685
Okay, anyway...

154
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,220
[whispers]
When are we getting the phone call?

155
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:31,090
[Kim] I know. We're waiting anxiously
for the news of the sex.

156
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,658
[Khloé] Is Kylie doing that or not?

157
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,428
Like, did the doctor call her?
Like, what's happening?

158
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,631
[Khloé]
I am finally over my first trimester.

159
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,066
I'm onto my second.

160
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,735
So, I'm kind of out of that danger zone,
as they say.

161
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,670
And I just feel really good right now.

162
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,440
I am at the place where I'm able
to take a blood test

163
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,375
to find out the sex of our baby.

164
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:54,614
So, Kylie wants Doctor A to call her
to give her the gender

165
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,750
and then Kylie's gonna call me
and reveal the gender to me.

166
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,887
Isn't that scary? We're going
to a whole other state to have a baby.

167
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,755
And you guys don't all have to come.
That's like...

168
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,756
-This isn't...
-Why? Of course, we will.

169
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,124
No, you're gonna leave...

170
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,959
-It's your first baby. Yeah.
-...your families and kids?

171
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,528
-No, that's so stupid.
-[Kim] It'll be a good break.

172
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,062
Maybe I'll just bring the little baby.

173
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,998
Do you want a December... What's...

174
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,232
So it's either December 5th.

175
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,568
It would be easy to think
of, like, my kids

176
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,503
'cause all their luggage is numbered.

177
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,573
So, like, North is 15
'cause she's June 15th,

178
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,875
and Saint's is 5 'cause he's December 5th.

179
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,777
So my kids are 5, 15

180
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,680
and it would be kind of cute, 5, 15, 25.

181
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,449
But it doesn't really matter.

182
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,517
It's a lug... It's a luggage tag.

183
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,619
Oh, my...

184
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,522
[upbeat music]

185
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,135
[Kourtney] Okay, what do you need?

186
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,337
I really don't need a thing.

187
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,640
Okay, well, yes, you do.

188
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,577
-[sighs]
-I'm so over that.

189
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,613
Okay, so, you're not pumping.
You don't need any pump stuff.

190
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,714
[Kim gasps]

191
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,883
[Kim] Oh, my gosh,
I'm gonna get North this. Look.

192
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,652
Kourt, sky, or a pink crayon?

193
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,155
I don't know. You need to buy stuff
for the new baby.

194
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,158
That's why we're here. We're not here
to buy stuff for North and Saint.

195
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,961
I mean, if I have to get something,
this is what I would get.

196
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,729
But shouldn't I save this stuff for...

197
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,599
-I mean, I'm not doing a registry, but...
-You're not?

198
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,334
Why would I?

199
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,970
You don't want to have
a baby shower at all?

200
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,205
I mean, what's the point?
Like, I don't know.

201
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,877
No, just to have a celebration
to welcome a new child into our family.

202
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,846
Kourtney really wanted
to take me baby shopping,

203
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,949
and it's something that I loved to do
with my last two kids,

204
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,119
but, you know, this time,
I think it's definitely different.

205
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,256
I don't know if it's 'cause, physically,
I'm not carrying the baby

206
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,124
so I feel like there's so much more time.

207
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,428
And it's just, like, makes it harder
for me to get into it.

208
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,331
[Kourtney] All right, so did we get
anything for the baby?

209
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,300
Washcloths?

210
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,006
[upbeat music]

211
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,718
-We're going to San Francisco!
-San Francisco, here we come.

212
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,555
-Oh.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

213
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,657
[airplane engine droning]

214
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,662
-Oh, my golly. Whoa.
-Holy [bleep], that's a fast plane. Oh.

215
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,866
Well, I'm excited, and I'm so thankful
you guys are doing this.

216
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,401
[Kim] Oh, my God, of course.

217
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,436
We're here to celebrate you.

218
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,704
-[Khloé] Us?
-You.

219
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,540
-All of us, it's sister time.
-This is just you.

220
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,975
Sister time.

221
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,312
[Khloé] Did you like your therapy?

222
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,047
-Loved it, yeah.
-[Khloé] Good.

223
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:45,484
I just was like, "Scott just roams
into my house like it's his house."

224
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,686
He walks in my bedroom.

225
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,422
I was like, "I don't think he should come
in my bedroom anymore."

226
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:53,859
I mean, he came inside and goes,
"Can I look through your glasses?

227
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,861
I think you might have some of mine."

228
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,799
And I'm like, "It's my closet."
Why is he looking through my sunglasses?

229
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:05,404
I just said to the therapist, like,
"I want to keep things comfortable, I do."

230
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,841
It's, like, nice for the kids
that it's, like, pretty normal.

231
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,944
But I'm in a relationship now
and it has to make sense

232
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,679
for my relationship too.

233
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,451
[Kourtney] I want Scott to see the kids,
but I feel like he's been coming

234
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,653
sometimes just, like, unannounced.

235
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,722
And there needs to be
some sort of boundaries,

236
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,626
so I have to figure out how to talk to him
about this kind of stuff.

237
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,128
[tense music]

238
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,133
[Khloé] Hello.

239
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,635
[man] We're gonna be going up
to the penthouse.

240
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,037
-[Khloé] Oh, how fancy!
-[elevator door dings]

241
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,538
[Kourtney] Look at the ceiling.

242
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,474
It's so cool.

243
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,043
-[Khloé] This is one room?
-[Kim] Oh, it looks so cute.

244
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,177
I love The Fairmont.

245
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,180
Kourt, this is where you be like,
"Oh, my God, we're in the penthouse!"

246
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:52,585
-Oh, my God, we're in San Francisco!
-[Khloé] Oh, my God!

247
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,988
-[Thomas] This place was built in 19...
-Oh, look up there.

248
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,757
-[Thomas] Yeah, isn't that beautiful?
-[Kourtney] Oh, my gosh.

249
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,293
[Thomas] That's all hand-done.
Here's the big secret in this room.

250
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,431
{\an8}Up here, in the center,
there's a secret door.

251
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,733
-Oh, yes. I see the handle.
-You see the little handle there?

252
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,803
And if you like, I'll open it for you.
You can run up the stairs.

253
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,272
[Thomas] So, here we are.

254
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,775
And behind that, it leads to the roof.

255
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,476
[Kourtney] That's crazy.

256
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,545
[Thomas]
There was a very famous blonde lady

257
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,980
who came through that door

258
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,182
when a certain president was staying here.

259
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,051
Marilyn Monroe.

260
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,120
[Thomas] If you have any questions,
I'll be happy to answer them.

261
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,256
Otherwise, I hope you have
a wonderful stay here.

262
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,358
-Thank you.
-Oh, it's my pleasure.

263
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,594
-[Khloé] You want to go eat?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

264
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,202
I'm so excited for you
to get the news from Kylie.

265
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,570
[Kourtney] What news?

266
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,938
Don't tell her.

267
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,107
-[Kourtney] Oh, the sex of Khloé's?
-Mm-hmm.

268
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,843
Why, Kylie's the only one that knows?

269
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,411
No, no one knows yet.

270
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,847
And if Kylie doesn't answer the phone,
the doctor will call me.

271
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,615
So, when will Tristan know?

272
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,184
[Khloé] When I get to Cleveland.

273
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,320
But I'm not having everyone find out
before Tristan.

274
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:07,660
'Cause somehow, all my [bleep] keeps
getting places, which is [bleep] up.

275
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,295
[Khloé] Everyone is suspecting
that I'm pregnant,

276
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,063
and when that rumor came out,

277
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,900
it really took away the opportunity
that I got to tell a lot of my friends.

278
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:18,304
So me being able to know the gender
before anybody else,

279
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,072
and that I get to share it
with Tristan on my own,

280
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,174
like, that's really special to us.

281
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,276
[Kim] You know what we should do
once a year?

282
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:28,047
Have each family member
take care of all the kids at once.

283
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:28,981
Oh, no.

284
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:33,219
It was so satisfying when I had,
like, Mason, Penelope, North, Saint,

285
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,354
and I was, like, "Get up, get up, get up.

286
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,089
Did you brush your teeth? You brush
your teeth? You brush your teeth?"

287
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,125
And that used to, like,
freak me out, thinking like,

288
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,526
"Oh, my God, I can't do it."

289
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,095
I literally, like, love it.

290
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,965
I, like, crave it.

291
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,366
That's like suicide.

292
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,701
[laughs]

293
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,971
[upbeat music]

294
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,676
[Kim] Hey, hey, now.

295
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,112
-[Khloé] So, what are we waiting on?
-Kourt.

296
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,616
-Thank you.
-Did you know, this hotel is haunted?

297
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,318
-Come on, my soul can't handle that.
-Listen. Let me tell you.

298
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:10,890
The Fair sisters, they started this hotel,
they died in the earthquake in 1906.

299
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,226
And they are known to caress people
and, like, whisper to them.

300
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,995
That's not cool. Please, Fair sisters,

301
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,764
I love you, I respect you.
Please do not caress me.

302
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,399
Wait, is that what you're wearing?

303
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,333
Yeah.

304
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,669
-Come on. We're going to dinner.
-[Khloé] No, I can't...

305
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,205
I don't have loose clothes like that.

306
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,807
-Let me tell you...
-Mm-hmm.

307
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,176
...right now should be your time to shine.

308
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,611
I would run around practically naked.

309
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,515
I'm not cute enough where you're, like,
showing, where you want to show it off.

310
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,817
I'm just, like, at that phase
where you're like,

311
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,085
"Did she gain a few pounds?"
You can't tell.

312
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,656
Like, I would rather be my skinny self
or a little bigger.

313
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,957
Like, right now, I'm just like...

314
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,959
Trust me, when you get a little bigger,
you're gonna be like,

315
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,029
"Why wasn't I showing it all off then?"

316
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,198
-But I mean, you look...
-Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

317
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,732
-I get it.
-You look phenomenal.

318
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,601
-And if I was you, I'd be wearing...
-Oh, my God, thanks.

319
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,403
-...stuff like that all the time.
-Should I have had longer bike shorts?

320
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,538
Like, does that look
cellulite-y right there?

321
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,842
-No. You don't look cellulite-y.
-[Kim] Okay. Thank you.

322
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,178
[light music]

323
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,054
[Khloé sighs]

324
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,622
What is she doing?

325
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,059
[line ringing]

326
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,296
-[automated voice] <i>I'm sorry...</i>
-Like, you're on your phone.

327
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,798
You don't see me calling you?

328
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,899
[Kourtney] Khlo?

329
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,035
-Kourt. I'm being serious.
-Yeah?

330
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,705
-You need to figure out your life.
-I'm on the phone with Larsa.

331
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,139
But I'm saying,
so then you shouldn't be on the phone.

332
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,407
We've been waiting for you for 30 minutes.

333
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,576
-I was getting ready.
-But you're always like this.

334
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,612
And we're just waiting for you
and waiting for you.

335
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,347
-It's crazy.
-I don't have time to listen to you yell.

336
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,648
[Khloé] I don't have time to wait for you.

337
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,883
-I don't want to go on trips...
-So don't wait.

338
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,151
...if this is how you are
every [bleep] time.

339
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,387
You don't care how selfish that is?

340
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,190
I'll call you when I get back
from the thing. Bye.

341
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,959
[tense music]

342
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,829
[Kourtney] Shall we?

343
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,564
[Khloé] No, let's just wait longer.

344
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,940
[camera shutter clicks]

345
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,444
-[Khloé] Smells so good.
-[Kourtney] It does.

346
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,080
So excited.

347
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:19,318
Oh, the traditional egg-lemon soup
with chicken and rice is so yummy.

348
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,754
[Kim] I'm gonna get baked feta.

349
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,489
So, do you ever wonder, like,

350
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,325
what the new baby's personality
is gonna be like?

351
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,363
Do you think how someone is pregnant,

352
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,600
do you really think that takes an effect
on how the baby is?

353
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,868
The temperament?

354
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:40,406
I don't know, I was...
I was pretty, like, amped-up with North.

355
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,608
And then pretty calm with Saint.

356
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,112
I wonder about the new baby, just it all.
It's so interesting to me.

357
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,216
-What?
-Your new baby, like, it's so interesting.

358
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,320
A surrogate thing.

359
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,124
[Khloé] I know that Kim isn't having
a baby in the traditional way,

360
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:03,162
but I really hope that she will start
to open up more about the process.

361
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:07,433
I mean, I'm super excited for her
and I want her to feel just as excited.

362
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,769
And I think the more she talks about it,
the more she'll get excited.

363
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:14,373
This magazine just said that I'm pregnant
with a baby bump,

364
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,409
-that I was flaunting it last night.
-Flaunting.

365
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,379
So many people have written me today.

366
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,615
-And what do you say?
-Saying anything you want to tell me.

367
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,818
I say, "Nope, not true."

368
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,022
[electronic music]

369
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,195
[Khloé] Kourt.

370
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,333
-[Kim] Kourt, you ready?
-[Kourtney] God, what the [bleep]?

371
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,803
-She's mad at us?
-[Kim] Yeah.

372
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,675
-Kourt?
-[knocking on door]

373
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,244
-[Kourtney] Come in. Hey.
-Hey.

374
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,546
We're ready. I just am gonna fall asleep.

375
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,683
[Kourtney] Oh, okay.
Just taking this [bleep] tape off.

376
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,652
-How long do you think? Like, five, ten?
-[Kourtney] I can be ready in five.

377
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,820
Okay.

378
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,994
[Khloé] Like, I'm tired, [bleep].
Pick up the pace and let's go.

379
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,763
[Kim] Yeah.

380
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,799
Do you have a... a wipe, anyone?

381
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,401
I would look in the glam room
if I were you...

382
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,037
I have so much [bleep] makeup
on my sweater.

383
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:22,307
Well, you've got to be careful
when you put your shirt on.

384
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,777
-[Kim] Maybe get off the phone and focus.
-Right.

385
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,120
[Kim] Oh, I'm cold already.

386
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,156
[Khloé] Those are big boats.

387
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,328
Cool.

388
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,465
Oh, blankies. It smells good on here.

389
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,802
Is this hot chocolate with whipped creamy?

390
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,637
Oh, that's so cute. It's like a little...

391
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,705
-[phone ringing]
-...thing.

392
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,641
[Kourtney] Hi.

393
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,645
{\an8}We're on a boat going to Alcatraz.

394
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:05,284
Yeah, no, he went today
and then was supposed to leave tomorrow.

395
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,887
Um, hold on.

396
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,722
Can we not film me while I'm on the phone?

397
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,491
Thank you.

398
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,560
She's a waste.

399
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,367
[Kim]
Kourtney's on this deep conversation.

400
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,504
She's literally never present.
She's always on the phone.

401
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,608
She can't even live in the moment
'cause she has whatever drama's going on.

402
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:33,645
I assume that it has something to do
with Scott and Younes.

403
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,648
I think she just needs to really
figure out what these boundaries are

404
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,218
'cause it's getting messy,
and it's getting annoying.

405
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,921
And it's taking away time
from our, like, sister time.

406
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,558
[Kourtney] Guys, there's
the chocolate sign, from the place...

407
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,560
[Khloé] What the [bleep] are you here for?

408
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,395
Don't chime in if you're not gonna...

409
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,698
-Get on your [bleep] phone call...
-Have fun tonight.

410
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,700
Okay, bye.

411
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:58,504
[Khloé] You're, like, a waste of space
in my meter right now.

412
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,539
[Kourtney] I'm looking at everything.

413
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,975
You're annoying as [bleep] now that,
when we're together.

414
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,744
Like, this is what you do,
you're on your phone the whole time.

415
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,312
You're just not present.

416
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,949
[Kourtney] I had
a ten-minute conversation with Sarah,

417
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,384
and that's offensive?

418
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,386
-[Kim] Yeah.
-Yes, because we're only here once.

419
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,088
When are we ever
gonna go back to Alcatraz?

420
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,456
But we were sitting down...

421
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,725
-You know what? Actually...
-...in a cafeteria on a bench.

422
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,094
I'm not doing this today
because last time in Costa Rica...

423
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,495
-Let's throw her over...
-...I looked crazy.

424
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,031
'Cause I'm always the one complaining
to get you guys to have fun.

425
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,500
[Khloé] I'm not gonna be crazy, okay?

426
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,936
You'll be the [bleep] bitch
that you need to be shown that you are.

427
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,205
[Kourtney]
Good. [bleep] you, you [bleep] whore.

428
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,840
-[bleep] you, you [bleep].
-You [bleep] pregnant whore.

429
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,409
What's what say? Ghirardelli Chocolate?

430
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,212
[Kourtney] That's what I told you before,
you [bleep].

431
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,848
[tense music]

432
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,453
[Kim] What sucks is that they would escape
probably in the middle of the night,

433
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,622
so they'd have to swim in this water.

434
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,525
[Khloé] I would never, ever swim at night.

435
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,993
I barely swim in the day.

436
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,029
{\an8}-Hi, there. Hi, nice to meet you.
-Hi. How are you?

437
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,397
{\an8}-Hi, nice to meet you.
-You too, I'm Kim.

438
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,665
{\an8}-Nice to meet you, Kim. Hi.
-Hi.

439
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,500
[Michael]
So we're gonna go in this door here.

440
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,002
This place was created
for the worst of the worst.

441
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,104
It was considered
the cream of the criminal crop.

442
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,906
[Khloé]
"Break the rules and you go to prison.

443
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,042
Break the prison rules
and you go to Alcatraz."

444
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,345
-[Kim] Oh, yes.
-[Khloé] Whoa.

445
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,514
-[Michael] So this is Alcatraz.
-[Khloé] Wow.

446
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,050
-[Michael] And this is Broadway.
-[Kim] Wait, Kourt, your hand.

447
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,518
[Khloé] Kourt, stop being a bitch.

448
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,553
[Kourtney] I hate you both.

449
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,057
I feel like I was a little bit distracted.

450
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,327
I've been distracted about
this boundary issue with Scott,

451
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,396
and maybe I just need to deal with this
when I get back to LA.

452
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:37,469
So from now on, I'm going to just be
totally present in this trip,

453
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,138
and just, like, have an amazing time
with my sisters.

454
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,573
Excuse me.

455
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,609
[chuckles]

456
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,345
We've got a felon on the loose.

457
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,214
[Kourtney] She's beating me up.

458
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,883
She needs to be put back in her cell,
please.

459
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,285
[Khloé] That's a good one.

460
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,053
-They're on the way.
-Okay.

461
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,356
[Kourtney] You're so jealous
you didn't come up with that on your own.

462
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,358
[Khloé laughs]

463
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,928
[Khloé] Look how small their cell...
Is this how big current cells are now?

464
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,997
[Michael] No, I think a lot of them
are a lot bigger than this,

465
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,032
but this is a five-by-nine cell.

466
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,533
Wow.

467
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,902
Yeah, and these are some of the convicts
that were here.

468
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,170
[Khloé] Huh.

469
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,372
[Michael] And then, over here,

470
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,240
-this was actually...
-I would hook up with the second one.

471
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,609
[soft laughter]

472
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,012
[Michael] And then, 181,
this cell right here,

473
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,747
that is Al Capone's cell.

474
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,316
-[Kourtney] Oh, wow.
-That's where Al Capone lived on Alcatraz.

475
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,786
-Do you even know who Al Capone is?
-Yeah, I do, you [bleep] whore.

476
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,789
-Guess what?
-[shutter clicks]

477
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,491
I've seen <i>Scarface.</i>

478
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,825
[sighs]

479
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,561
[upbeat music]

480
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,035
[Michael] This is the surgical suite.

481
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,171
And this is where several inmates died,
in this room.

482
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,641
[Kim] This is so gross
that this is their hospital.

483
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,911
[Michael]
This is actually the creepy place.

484
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,413
So they used to have

485
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,648
-a dungeon in the 1930s.
-[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

486
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,117
So inmates that were,
you know, really incorrigible,

487
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,185
that they had trouble with,

488
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,154
they would actually bring 'em down here.

489
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,823
-We can take a look if you want.
-[Kim] The dungeon? Sure.

490
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,558
[tense spooky music]

491
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,627
[Michael]
The inmates would come down here,

492
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,296
and they would actually keep them
for several days.

493
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,298
One person at a time?

494
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,234
One person at a time,
and they would be here in pitch black.

495
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,569
If you'd like to see it dark,

496
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,204
I don't know, John, if you're out there,

497
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,840
do you want to turn off the lights
for a second? Just to get a sense?

498
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,076
-Yeah, look at...
-[Khloé] John... John heard us.

499
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,378
-[Kim] All right, guys.
-So this is how dark it would be.

500
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,380
Could you imagine having to stay
down here for several days?

501
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,748
We're in the dungeon.

502
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,950
[Khloé] We now look like <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

503
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,188
[Kourtney] Can you turn your phone off
so we can really see?

504
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,058
[Khloé] Well, I would not like that.

505
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,060
[Kourtney] And wait, would...

506
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,230
-So, the whole day, is it pitch dark too?
-[Michael] Yep.

507
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,966
[Khloé] If you guys have any bad kids,
you got to take them here.

508
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,434
Scare the [bleep] out of them.

509
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,703
-Who wants to live like this?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

510
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,607
I'm just gonna copy everything you do,
just to annoy you.

511
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,542
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[Kourtney] Oops.

512
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,245
I'm like, turn your [bleep] volume off.
How old are you?

513
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,982
-How old do you think I am?
-90.

514
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,451
[upbeat music]

515
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,325
[alarm blaring]

516
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,327
[Kim] Like a test or an emergency?

517
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,329
No, it's a test, so we're fine.

518
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,897
I'm like, "I'm ready to roll."

519
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,133
-[waitress] Enjoy your lunch.
-[Kim] Thank you.

520
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:25,103
[man] <i>Please go to the nearest fire exit
and leave the building.</i>

521
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,005
[alarm blaring]

522
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,242
-I don't smell fire yet, so...
-I know. I was gonna say.

523
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,545
{\an8}<i>My sister's night into the restaurant,
and this is what happens.</i>

524
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,783
{\an8}[blaring continues]

525
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,652
{\an8}<i>What can I say? It's a test.</i>

526
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:41,887
{\an8}-[chuckles]
-[man] <i>Attention.</i>

527
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,955
{\an8}<i>An emergency has been reported.</i>

528
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,092
[Kim] I don't think
I've ever laughed so hard.

529
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,196
So I wanted to say thank you guys so much
for the San Fran trip.

530
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,065
Even though we had, you know,
our ups and our downs...

531
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,067
I've never had a better time with you.

532
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,803
...I feel like we still always have fun.

533
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,606
What is life without a little feuding
with her sisters, you know?

534
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,241
Fighting with you, bitches.

535
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,777
-Oh, Kourt, do you know how to do that?
-Mm. What?

536
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,479
-Remember, you used to do the string?
-Yeah, I could try,

537
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,414
but I need a strand of hair.

538
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,415
And my hair's in a bun.

539
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,184
Well, Kim has the hair.

540
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,319
Kim, take out a piece of hair, please.

541
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,189
[Kourtney] It could be a fake one.

542
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,293
[Khloé] So, a circle means what?

543
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,627
-We'll see.
-A girl, I think.

544
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,030
[Khloé] Circle means girl.

545
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,631
[Kourtney] A line is a boy.

546
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,068
Don't move it.

547
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,536
[Kim] That's a girl.

548
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,572
[Kourtney] Whoa, that's a strong one.

549
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,508
What does that mean?
It's gonna be, like, two twins?

550
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,945
-It's gonna be extra girly.
-[Khloé] Extra girly.

551
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,713
[Kourtney] It's gonna come out
with a tutu on.

552
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,885
-That's a line.
-That's Tristan Jr.

553
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,087
-[Khloé laughs]
-Okay.

554
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,856
[Khloé] I want you to do Kim's.

555
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,091
She'll see, does it count her surrogate?

556
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,693
[Kourtney] Okay, put your hand out.

557
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,264
-Okay, what is that?
-[Kourtney] Hold on.

558
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,833
It's getting started. That's a circle.

559
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,235
-Kourtney, you're moving it.
-Yeah.

560
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,936
You guys, I'm not moving it.

561
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,905
Do it one more time, and what if it...

562
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:10,208
-It will stop... when it's time.
-[Khloé] Yeah, what are you dipping it in?

563
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,543
I'm clearing it.

564
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,146
-No.
-This is a circle.

565
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,448
So one more girl.

566
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,016
Well, that's not true
'cause I don't have anymore.

567
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,484
No, that's a full circle.

568
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,520
-That's a crazy circle.
-Whoa, that's a crazy circle.

569
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,755
I think that's a natural pregnancy.

570
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,056
Okay, will you do it to me?

571
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,160
[Khloé] Flatten out your hand.

572
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,698
Oh, look, this one stopped.

573
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,034
Legit, it stopped.

574
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,703
-[Khloé] Kourt, it stopped.
-No.

575
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,771
[Kim] It stopped.

576
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,007
You're not having any more kids.

577
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,308
That's crazy.

578
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,013
[lively music]

579
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,984
[Khloé] Is this the <i>Mrs. Doubtfire</i> house?

580
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,220
[Kim] Oh, yeah.

581
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:02,193
[Khloé] The doctor said,
"Your baby genetics results are normal.

582
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,297
Will text Kylie with the gender info."
Smiley face.

583
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:09,267
And I just hit, "Oh, my God!"
With, like, five exclamation points.

584
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,702
Oh!

585
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,305
How did you just hear from her?

586
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,806
Because she wants to tell me,

587
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,841
so I'm trying to, like,
give Kylie a little.

588
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,711
I have such anxiety, okay?

589
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,813
-It's okay, whatever is meant to be.
-I know.

590
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,082
-Why do I have such anxiety?
-Even if it's a girl, just know

591
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,084
-that's what your path is...
-I know, and I'll love...

592
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,552
-...and that's fine.
-Of course, I want a girl eventually.

593
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,754
I just wanted, like,
older brothers to, like...

594
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,690
-We've never had older brothers.
-I know.

595
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,794
[Khloé] I am pretty much convinced
that I am having a boy.

596
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,128
I kind of am too.

597
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:40,532
I have such anxiety and nerves
to find out what I'm having,

598
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,202
but, like, oh, I just need Kylie
to [bleep] call me.

599
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,206
Like, what is she doing?

600
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,078
-[phone ringing]
-Oh, God!

601
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:59,284
{\an8}The doctor said she was calling you
with my results 35 minutes ago.

602
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,853
-[Kylie] <i>Okay, did she call you?</i>
-No!

603
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,622
-What?
-[Kylie] <i>Are you ready?</i>

604
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,990
<i>Who's there? Who's there?</i>

605
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,124
Say it!

606
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,527
{\an8}-[Kylie] <i>Who's there?</i>
-[Khloé] Me and Kim.

607
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,898
{\an8}-[Kylie] <i>Okay, are you sitting?</i>
-Kylie, say it!

608
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,800
[Kylie] <i>You're having a girl.</i>

609
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,135
You're lying.

610
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,603
[Kylie] <i>I'm not lying.</i>
[chuckles]

611
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,838
Shut up.

612
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,774
-[Kylie] <i>I'm so excited for you, Khloé!</i>
-Is she lying or serious?

613
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,142
Kylie, are you serious?

614
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,177
[Kylie] <i>Why would I lie about this?</i>

615
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,748
-I don't feel like I'm having a girl.
-That's so exciting.

616
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,250
[Kylie] <i>I'm, like, so excited.</i>

617
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,653
This is so exciting.

618
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:37,689
It's okay. I cried when I found out
North was gonna be a girl too.

619
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,392
I don't feel like
I'm having a girl at all.

620
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,961
I'm, like, in a state of shock.

621
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,296
[Kylie] <i>Oh, my God. It's like...</i>

622
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,599
-<i>This was...</i>
-What?

623
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,000
It's a girl?

624
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,135
{\an8}It is?

625
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,037
What? I'm shocked.

626
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,406
I'm shocked.

627
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:57,876
When you have your mind made up
as to, like, what you're having.

628
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,245
Like, everyone told me,
"You're gonna feel what you're having,

629
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,713
and you'll just kind of know."

630
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,715
[Khloé] And then when you find out
it's the complete opposite,

631
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,116
it's just a shock.

632
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:09,020
I just was convinced
that I was having a boy,

633
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,922
so to be having a girl, it's just like,

634
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,591
"Okay, that wasn't what I thought
was going on."

635
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,660
-[Khloé] They do think that I'm gonna cry.
-[line ringing]

636
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,029
[Kim]
Tell mom not to tell Tristan, though.

637
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,131
-[Kris] <i>Hi.</i>
-[Khloé] Hi, Mom.

638
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,168
{\an8}Do you want to know what I'm having?

639
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,402
{\an8}[Kris] <i>Yes!</i>

640
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,905
I'm having a girl.

641
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,208
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
[laughing]

642
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,043
<i>That is so amazing!</i>

643
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,448
I'm really hoping... I'm really hoping
Kylie's gonna say she's lying

644
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,450
and, like, I'm really having a boy.

645
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,220
[Kris]
<i>Khloé, the only thing I wanted in life,</i>

646
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,656
<i>the only thing, was a boy.</i>

647
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,859
<i>Three times, and I got the three of you.</i>

648
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:51,896
<i>But a man is much more attached to a girl.</i>

649
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,365
Totally, and I know Tristan
will be in love,

650
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:57,869
and I'll be in love,
and she'll be so cute and whatever, but...

651
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,605
[Kris] <i>This will be the love of his life,
no offense to you,</i>

652
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,841
<i>but this will be the love of his life.</i>

653
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,144
Well, then, I'm gonna get jealous,
and I'm jealous.

654
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,746
[Kris] <i>You probably will.</i>

655
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,548
Well, then, I don't like that,
I don't like her.

656
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,850
[chuckles]

657
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,853
[Kris] <i>Oh, don't be a bitch.</i>

658
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,323
[upbeat music]

659
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,034
{\an8}-[Scott] Hey.
-[Kourtney] Hey.

660
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,137
{\an8}I went and hang out with your mom
last night for a little bit.

661
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,438
-You did?
-Yeah.

662
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,106
-Where, at her house?
-At her house.

663
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,275
I went and sat in her room.
She was, like, in bed, but like...

664
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,843
She said she wasn't feeling well.

665
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,446
Yeah, I'm sure that's what she tells you.

666
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,480
-She said...
-No, she was fine.

667
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,516
I went and sat with her, like,
sat on her bed for a little bit.

668
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,751
She was, like, fully dressed in bed
like this.

669
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,688
Oh, 'cause she was keeping her glam
in case something, in case Kendall...

670
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,724
No, she said she was gonna
maybe come out with you,

671
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,325
-unless Kendall went.
-Yeah.

672
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,127
Um...

673
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,298
Anyways, I just felt like we should...

674
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,002
discuss some of the boundaries
in the house.

675
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:11,109
Scott and I get along,
but I do always get a little bit nervous

676
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:15,013
to have these kind of conversations
with him and, like, set boundaries

677
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:19,284
because it's, like, awkward to have to say
something that he may not like,

678
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,252
or that he may take the wrong way.

679
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,454
Like, we both just want to get along,

680
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,991
but then there's also things
that need to be said.

681
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:36,968
{\an8}I just felt like we should discuss
some of the boundaries in the house.

682
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,874
I feel like, sometimes,
because this was your house,

683
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,877
sometimes, I feel like you walk in
like it still is.

684
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:47,278
Yeah, I understand.

685
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:51,349
And so I feel like it has to make sense
for my relationship too,

686
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,419
and just, like, if you just, like,
wander into my bedroom and go,

687
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,121
"Hey, can I see all your sunglasses, and..."

688
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,791
Well, I was getting my sunglasses,
but okay.

689
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,993
No, you said,
"Hey, can I look at all your sunglasses?

690
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,128
-I think you have some of mine."
-Yeah, cause... And you did.

691
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,465
But you, like,
look through them all, just to...

692
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,100
I wasn't looking through your panties.

693
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,470
I understand the boundary
of not going into your bedroom

694
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,874
-'cause that's a private place for you.
-But then, the day after I said it,

695
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,175
you went right in.

696
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,376
[coughs]
Really?

697
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,978
You said, "Hey, can I come in?"

698
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,413
And the kids were there,
I wasn't gonna be like, "No."

699
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,617
Okay. There's obviously some boundaries
that we both need to respect,

700
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,552
and I don't want you to be uncomfortable.

701
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,654
No, I'm not uncomfortable.
I'm just saying...

702
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,656
Oh, so then, the next time,
I'll be up there naked.

703
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,424
Great. I'll call the police.

704
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,226
[laughs]

705
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,394
I get it.

706
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,030
All things that are understandable
in this co-parenting life.

707
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,300
-I was also thinking I have a boundary.
-Mm-hmm.

708
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,302
I don't really want to, like, hug anymore.

709
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,404
I think we should shake hands
when we see each other.

710
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,172
-Okay. We could do a high five.
-Is that cool?

711
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,641
Nah, that's too young.

712
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,142
Or we could do a...
[clicks tongue]

713
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,744
-Ooh, a fist pump?
-Mm-hmm.

714
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,245
-I'll meet you in the middle.
-Okay.

715
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:56,481
So if you're cool with that,
I'm cool with your stuff.

716
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,783
-Okay.
-Yo. Pleasure.

717
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,485
Pleasure.

718
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:02,787
[Scott] You be good now.

719
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,355
[Khloé] <i>Do your dance, North.</i>

720
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,557
-<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
-[laughter]

721
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,226
<i>Hold on... 20.</i>

722
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,761
<i>Kylie, you're like a chameleon.</i>

723
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,663
-<i>Ooh!
-You look just like Kim when you want to,</i>

724
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:12,864
<i>and then like me when you smile.</i>

725
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,668
{\an8}-[Kim] Okay, should we call Khloé?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

726
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,604
[toy yodeling]

727
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,909
{\an8}-[Khloé] <i>Hello.</i>
-Hey. What are you doing?

728
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:28,413
<i>I have a Bloomingdale's appearance.
What is happening over there?</i>

729
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,282
He's playing this bird, like, it yodels.

730
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,750
-And I'm like...
-[Kourtney] Khloé got it for them.

731
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:33,785
And they love it.

732
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:37,956
Well, now we can pay you back,
and get your daughter a full drum set,

733
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,558
and, like, electric guitar.

734
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,128
[Khloé] <i>Oh, lovely. Can't wait for that.</i>

735
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:48,299
Wait, so tell me everything
about Tristan's reaction.

736
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,500
[Khloé] <i>We were at the game,</i>

737
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,603
<i>and I was having the room, like,
decorated and everything.</i>

738
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,341
So did he know that when he was gonna
come home, he was gonna see something?

739
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,376
-[Khloé] <i>No.</i>
-Oh, he didn't?

740
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,411
[Khloé] <i>No, he had no idea.</i>

741
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,815
Tristan kept asking me,
"So I wonder how you're gonna tell me,

742
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,750
uh, the gender of the baby."

743
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,086
I'm thinking, "I wonder how I'm gonna
tell you... What does that mean?"

744
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,322
Like, so, he kind of wanted it
to be a big deal on his end,

745
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,125
which I think is the cutest thing ever.

746
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:18,262
[Khloé] <i>I had everyone come
after he left to go to work,</i>

747
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,098
<i>and then, we did the room.</i>

748
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,502
<i>But he was in such a bad mood
because of the game,</i>

749
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,104
<i>on the car ride home, I was just like,</i>

750
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,406
<i>"Oh, no, this is, like,
maybe not the best time,"</i>

751
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,075
<i>but I was like, "There's nothing I can do.
I can't clean it all up."</i>

752
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,244
<i>So when we came home,
I sped in front of him</i>

753
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,380
<i>and, like, ran upstairs
so I could shut the door,</i>

754
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,549
<i>and I was like, "Will he think it's weird
I, like, slammed the door in his face?</i>

755
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,284
<i>And he was just, he did it.</i>

756
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,920
<i>And he opened the door,
and he was so excited.</i>

757
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,890
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

758
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,459
<i>Oh!</i>

759
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,695
<i>My vision was right, I knew it.</i>

760
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,964
[Khloé] <i>Now, he'll be like,
"How's my princess doing?"</i>

761
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,099
<i>"I just want to check on my two girls,"</i>

762
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,068
<i>like, he's so cute about everything.</i>

763
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,003
Are you, like, more excited now?

764
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,174
[Khloé] <i>I still feel so bad, how I felt,
but that's just how I felt.</i>

765
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:08,079
<i>And I, like, think about North, or P,
like, "Okay, like, it's gonna be so cute."</i>

766
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,081
-<i>And I am getting more excited.</i>
-[Kim] Yeah.

767
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,051
It's fun. It's, like, girl's time,
and then we get to do it again.

768
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,152
[Khloé] <i>Totally.</i>

769
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,222
[Khloé]
I was looking at nurseries for boys,

770
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:22,293
and I just think you need, like,
a day or two to just let it sink in.

771
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,128
Then you get over it.
I mean, and honestly,

772
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,731
girl stuff is so much cuter anyway.

773
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,666
And it'll be so cute to have

774
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,035
just a little girl in the stands,

775
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,270
like, rooting for her dad.

776
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:36,207
Like, I know girls think their dads
are everything and then some.

777
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,844
Yeah, I'm honestly so excited
that Khloé's having a girl.

778
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:44,182
I've been, like, getting, like, me
and Khloé things for, like, our girls.

779
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,917
-And it's probably gonna be so annoying...
-Yeah.

780
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,418
...but they're all gonna, like,
have the same things,

781
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,921
-do the same things, be in the same class.
-I think that's so cute.

782
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,757
-So cute. See, that makes me excited.
-Yeah.

783
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:53,791
[Khloé sneezes]

784
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,494
-[Reign] Bless you, KoKo.
-[Khloé laughs]

785
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,129
[Khloé] <i>Thank you, Ree-jun.</i>

786
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,497
All right, I love you.

787
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,400
[Khloé] <i>Not as much as I love you.</i>

788
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,902
-Oh.
-Khloé, I love you the most.

789
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,671
[Khloé] <i>Oh, there she is.</i>

790
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,140
<i>She's finally in this conversation.</i>

791
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,741
Miss you much.

793
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,817
Tonight is the launch
of my PrettyLittleThing collaboration,

794
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,253
and we are throwing a huge party.

795
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,255
I have all my girlfriends coming,

796
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:27,725

with all my friends.

802
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,113
What are you doing here?

803
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,985
-You thought I would not come?
-No!

804
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,553
-So, you knew you were coming?
-Yeah.

805
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,222
I was like, "I have to support you."

806
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,724
Thank you.

807
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,362
You guys are really cute together.

808
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,230
Oh, yeah? You just realize that now?

809
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,466
I realize it every time.

811
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:27,018
So my surrogate is in town
for a doctor's appointment,

812
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:30,321
so I thought it would be an amazing time
for her to meet my family,

813
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,558
but still not expose
who she is to the world.

814
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,959
Just for her safety.

815
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,128
[Kim] Okay, let's go inside.
All righty.

816
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,730
[Kim] This has been
such a long journey for us,

817
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,366
and something that I've wanted
for so long,

818
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,802
and I share, like,
everything with my family.

819
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,075
{\an8}[Kim] Guys...

820
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,511
I want you to meet La'Reina.

821
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:54,979
-Hi, La'Reina!
-Hi.

822
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,749
-Oh, so good to meet you.
-[La'Reina] You too.

823
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,151
-Hi.
-You're so big today.

824
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,220
-That's Khloé.
-Hi. How are you?

825
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,754
Kendall was here somewhere.

826
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,089
-Kylie.
-Oh, my God.

827
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,457
-[La'Reina giggles]
-And her friend, Jordyn.

828
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,758
Hi, Jordyn.

829
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,227
[Khloé] So, you have two other kids?

830
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,494
-[La'Reina] Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

831
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,529
You have two boys, right?

832
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,431
[La'Reina] Yes, I do. Three and five.

833
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,199
[Kendall] Do you mind being pregnant?
I guess you obviously don't.

834
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,235
I don't. I've always had easy pregnancies.

835
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,137
Um, this one had a couple of things
here or there,

836
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,873
but I like being pregnant,
and I know that sounds really weird.

837
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,610
The pregnancy itself, you know,
it just feels natural,

838
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,144
like I'm supposed to do it.

839
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,813
[Kylie] So, you have a placenta issue too?

840
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,047
[La'Reina] Yes. Yeah.

841
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,950
But I spoke to the doctor today,
and he said the baby looks fantastic.

842
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,518
-So he doesn't see any worries.
-[Kylie] Oh, good.

843
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,420
-Oh, that's good.
-[La'Reina] Yeah.

844
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,823
[Kim] It definitely makes me feel good
that my surrogate

845
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,459
does not need to have a C-section,

846
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,327
and the placenta moved out of the way.

847
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,363
[Kim] Now it's, like, back to normal.

848
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,032
So the baby will just come whenever
she's ready,

849
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,634
and we are on standby.

850
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,136
So what happens when the baby comes out,

851
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,939
-they clean the baby up...
-[Kylie] Should we sit outside? My legs...

852
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,275
Do you want to sit in here?
Is it too cold outside?

853
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,144
Why don't we get her a plate?
You want a plate with some food?

854
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,680
-[La'Reina] I'll take some fruit actually.
-[Kris] Whatever you want.

855
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,115
-[La'Reina] How are you feeling?
-[Kylie] I'm good.

856
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,517
-Oh, good, good.
-[Kylie] I know we're, like...

857
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,352
-[Khloé] A month apart.
-[La'Reina] Really?

858
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,820
Oh, my God, congratulations!

859
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,756
-No, you two are a month apart.
-Are we?

860
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,090
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

861
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,426
-We're three months apart, me and her.
-Oh, really?

862
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,962
-Oh, how exciting.
-Yeah. Yeah.

863
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,563
-Yeah.
-Are you guys excited?

864
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,931
-Yeah.
-That's so amazing.

865
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:23,701
We both have never
been through this before.

866
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,102
[Khloé] And it's your first girl?

867
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,370
-[La'Reina] Huh? Second girl.
-[Khloé] Okay.

868
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,673
[La'Reina] So I've had two boys,
God gave me two boys,

869
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,075
and then for the surrogate babies,
it was two girls.

870
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:36,314
But emotionally, for you,
is it, like, super, like, depressing,

871
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,516
-or something after the fact?
-[La'Reina] No.

872
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:42,353
No. Because I know from the very beginning
this is not my baby,

873
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,623
at the end, my joy and my satisfaction

874
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,125
is with whoever I'm having the baby for.

875
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,795
So when the baby comes out,
they're just like,

876
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,464
"Okay, well, do you want skin on skin?"
I'm like, "No.

877
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,733
-Let her go to her mom."
-[Kendall] What does "skin on skin" mean?

878
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,835
[Kris] When they put the baby
on your chest.

879
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,404
When... If you gave birth,
then the baby would come up,

880
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,674
and you would go right on your chest
to feel your heart on heart,

881
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,343
and just the whole bonding thing.

882
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:08,479
That's really amazing
in the first few minutes of birth.

883
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,915
-Did you want to hold her?
-[La'Reina] Um, not...

884
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:14,185
I didn't feel the need to,
but, I mean, I love babies,

885
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,587
so it was nice for me to hold her.
I would... I love...

886
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,423
-You're very matter-of-fact about it.
-[La'Reina] Yeah, I really am.

887
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,493
It's... 'Cause I know what my job is
in all of it, you know what I'm saying,

888
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,829
and it's, like,
it makes me feel important,

889
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,932
'cause I'm like,
"Wow, I did something so good.

890
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:31,802
This is beautiful, like, I would do
this again a thousand more times."

891
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,005
This experience, going into it,
I really didn't know what to expect

892
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,642
'cause I don't really know anyone
that's gone through this.

893
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,980
It was definitely not as easy
as I thought it would be, emotionally,

894
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:47,318
but it's so worth it,
and our surrogate is such a nice person.

895
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,987
My family absolutely loves her.

896
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,655
And I'm just so grateful.

897
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,124
This is so beautiful.

-[La'Reina] Thank you!

who do have pregnancy issues

902
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,136

Without you,
this wouldn't have been possible, so...

906

we can't say thank you enough.

907

-[Kris] Really.
