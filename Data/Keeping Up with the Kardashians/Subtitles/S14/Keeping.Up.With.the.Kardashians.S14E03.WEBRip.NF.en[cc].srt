like a MILF gone wild.

-No.

[Kendall] The Met Gala is a ball

that Anna Wintour and <i>Vogue</i>
put on every year, um, and it's for...

18
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,265
-The Costume Institute.
-[Kendall] At the Metropolitan Museum.

19
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,801
[Kim] You get partnered up
with different designers.

20
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,037
Every designer does their own take
on the theme,

21
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:16,176
and then there's a whole exhibit inside
showcasing pieces that are in that theme.

22
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,412
I don't know how we're gonna do it,
but should we cover my butt more?

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,682
[Khloé] You have the cutest little butt
I've ever seen in my life.

24
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,119
If I had your body,
I'm walking around in that.

25
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,722
No [bleep] to give. I don't give
a [bleep]. I'm just perfect.

26
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:33,526
I'm just worried about that.
If I'm not cautious...

27
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,864
I remember sitting at home,
just, like, on the night of the Met,

28
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,402
on my computer every year, just, like,
waiting to see what people are gonna wear.

29
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,270
Definitely, like, the biggest thing.

30
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,206
[Kylie] Like, I need to kind of suffocate.

31
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,007
We'll guide it.
We're really good at doing that.

32
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,644
It needs to be like this, like,
where my body looks crazy.

33
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,346
Like, I need to not be able
to breathe for, like...

34
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,548
Mm-hm. We can definitely make that happen.

35
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,151
-...the whole time.
-I want to be cellulite-proof.

36
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,519
-I want, like, a barrier.
-Right.

37
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:03,022
-Not, like, white.
-No, of course, that dress is paper-thin.

38
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,858
That's, like, worse than a bathing suit,
it's so thin.

39
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:08,461
To show less cellulite.
So I was just thinking, like, my pose,

40
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,663
I literally can't be like this,
with too much of a hip.

41
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,065
I have to be like this...

42
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,234
-Right.
-...to where I look skinnier.

43
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,903
Wait, is this just straight up
my underwear?

44
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,305
Can we make this way more...

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,710
[Kendall] This is gonna need
to be fully lined, like, fully lined.

46
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,512
[Khloé] Rock out with your cock out.

these heels and this dress.

52
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,925
I need to take it really slow.
But that's how it was the year before.

53
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,593
I just need to be extra careful.

54
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,863

and literally have no friends?

00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,973
-They won't see it.
-Yeah, they will.

162
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,407
[Mario] We'll pull it down
when we get out.

163
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,610
It is. Maybe we blow-dry it out.

164
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,412
[man] It's really the driver's call
in case it blows a fuse.

165
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,382
Yeah, let's just try. Who cares...
Who cares if it blows out?

166
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,253
Wayne, will you put the thing down?
Don't open the door yet.

167
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,689
Just don't open the door yet,
but knock when it's...

168
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,324
-Or you can leave it open.
-[man] Okay.

169
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,160
Just so we know when we're there,
'cause I can't really see.

170
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,297
-[man] We just blew that fuse.
-[Michael] Stop.

171
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,065
-We're stopping.
-[man] We need to pull over.

172
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,101
[Kim] Is there anything to reset the fuse?

173
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,270
[crowd cheering outside]

174
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,405
Oh, my God.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

175
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,943
[man] We just blew that fuse.

176
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,045
[Michael] We're ready
to pull up in a second.

177
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,080
[Kim] I'm literally going
to [bleep] my [bleep] pants.

178
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,949
[Mario] Are you excited
with the red bottom place?

179
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,085
-Lord, have mercy.
-Okay.

180
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,556
-Mario, yeah?
-Yeah, but Mario needs to get in too.

181
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,157
All right, let me out.

182
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,359
[man] Let me know when you're ready
'cause we're ready to get out.

183
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,527
-[Mario] Yeah.
-[Kim] Okay.

184
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,095
Open it. Let's go.

185
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,697
-[man] Just say when you're ready.
-[knocking]

186
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,932
Yes, yes.

187
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,606
[crowd shouting, screaming]

188
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,513
-[Michael] Yeah.
-[Mario] Thank you.

189
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,352
[crowd shouting, screaming]

190
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,987
I was about to throw up.

191
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,822
[Kendall] I totally know the freak-out.

192
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,891
Every year it's kind of scary.

193
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,329
-[cameras clicking]
-[photographers clamoring]

194
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,431
[upbeat music]

195
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,470
[Kendall] When I get on the carpet,
sometimes I'm like,

196
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,974
"Okay, just, like, focus for a second
and really work it."

197
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,109
-Yeah.
-Like, take the moment and whatever.

198
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,510
So then, you kind of do that.

199
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,181
Like, I'll say things to myself, like,

200
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:20,353
"Suck my stomach in. Stick my butt out.
Chin down. Arms down this way."

201
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,724
-Why do we freak out?
-'Cause you want to look good.

202
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,298
No makeup, no filter.

203
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,567
See you soon.

204
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,803
{\an8}Wait, can we wait one second?

205
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,438
[Kourtney] Is that Syd? I think so.

206
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,840
-Hey, Syd.
-[Sydney] Hi.

207
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,510
{\an8}-Okay, thank you.
-You're welcome. Is there, like, a wallet?

208
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,379
{\an8}-[Kourtney] I have a bag for you.
-Okay.

209
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,481
It doesn't say what...

210
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,416
Oh.

211
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,852
...thing it is.

212
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,221
-It should say that stuff.
-Oh, here, here, here.

213
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,589
-Right.
-Okay.

214
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,224
Oh, this is so shady.

215
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,128
I know Kourt has been out
on the dating scene recently.

216
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:05,197
[Khloé] She is planning
a little birthday surprise tonight.

217
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,366
I don't really know
the details of tonight.

218
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,068
But she's, like,
doing this whole exchange.

219
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,772
Like, she's putting,
like, a hotel key into this wallet.

220
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,775
Never known Kourtney
to be this giddy ever in my life.

221
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,010
I've never known Kourtney
to plan anything.

222
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,513
It's so cute, though,
to see her this giddy.

223
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,682
Just be fun.
You're, like, so [bleep] weird about it.

224
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,017
-Okay, okay. Okay, okay.
-Just like that.

225
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,153
[Khloé]
I know a little bit about this guy.

226
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,523
But I'm not gonna ask a lot of questions,
'cause she's super awkward.

227
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,059
-Don't, yeah.
-No, and she, like, will shut down...

228
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,660
Right, don't-ask-don't-tell policy.

229
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,264
Or do I put it all in the middle part?

230
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,434
-No, you want him to see it.
-I'm not even putting it in the box.

231
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,070
-You just gonna hand it.
-Put it in the box. What's wrong with you?

232
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,105
-Okay.
-Now it looks like you got it for free.

233
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,106
[chuckles]

234
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,642
And, like... Okay.

235
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,078
She's handing him what, just that thing?

236
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,546
He'll be like,
"What [bleep] are you doing?"

237
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,083
-Okay, no bow on the box, right?
-Come on, with the bow. Nobody does bows.

238
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,751
-Okay.
-Okay.

239
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,220
-All right, I'll text you the address.
-[Sydney] Okay.

240
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,655
Okay, thanks, Syd.

241
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,924
Watch, disaster, that you don't find him.

242
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,860
-Right?
-The whole thing's a [bleep] mess.

243
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,496
Or she gives it to somebody else
by accident.

244
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,266
Kourtney's like, "Hey!"
[laughs]

245
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,735
-Right.
-Okay, let's go.

246
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,039
I'm trying to think of what I could eat

247
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,875
that's not gonna make
my stomach stick out.

248
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,777
I have this really tight dress
to wear tonight.

249
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,446
-Hey! Happy Cinco de Mayo, guys!
-Oh, my God.

250
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,048
[Jonathan trills]

251
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,051
That's all you got?
It's not necessary to be late in life.

252
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,519
Will you read that?

253
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,620
You're gonna die.

254
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,523
[Kim] What do I say?

255
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,693
You should laugh, at this point.

256
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,394
-[Kim] Should I just write, "LOL"?
-Yeah.

257
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,799
-Perfect or cool?
-"LOL, I'm Kim [bleep] K."

258
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,200
Like, why can't you just be normal?

259
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,503
She's got
a real insecurity problem lately,

260
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,204
and you should have
a major conversation with her.

261
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,007
Here, Kim,
I'm gonna freaking kick you, like, stop.

262
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,611
You should have seen me at the Met.
If you think this is bad, Jonathan.

263
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,946
I was in the car, on the way there, going,

264
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,615
"I'm gonna [bleep] my pants.
I'm gonna die."

265
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,916
[Khloé] Like, what happened to you?

266
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:08,053
You know what it was, honestly?
That Mexico trip really [bleep] me up.

267
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,855
-The cellulite?
-[Kim] Yeah.

268
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,458
To say that you're not gonna know
anyone in the Met...

269
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,727
I know.

270
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,097
[Khloé] Kim looked absolutely amazing
at the Met Ball,

271
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,066
and even though I would hope
those pictures would give her, like,

272
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,768
another surge of confidence

273
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,771
and maybe make her realize,
"Okay, it was just bad photos in Mexico,"

274
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,908
it seems like the Mexico pictures
are never-ending

275
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,077
and I think it's just making her
think about Paris again

276
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,146
and that response to her being robbed.

277
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:38,450
She was being mocked and made fun of
for this really traumatic thing

278
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,520
that happened to her and I feel like
that only was more traumatic.

279
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,322
And now her having
these pictures come out,

280
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,927
now everyone has another reason
to kind of ridicule her and mock her.

281
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,229
It's one of the few times
she's been seen back out

282
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:54,900
and this is how she gets treated,
and it's not fair and it's really cruel.

283
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,907
[Kourtney] Do you want kids to be showered
and in pajamas when they come to you?

284
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,242
-Sure.
-Okay.

285
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,379
And then should... is six good for dinner?

286
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,647
-Or later?
-Yeah.

287
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,718
-[Kris] So you're babysitting tonight?
-Mm-hm.

288
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,356
-Just that?
-[Jonathan] A little more exciting.

289
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,463
I'm super secretive when it comes to me,
like, newly dating someone.

290
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,266
But I'm also not sitting at, like,
a family table,

291
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,134
planning little surprise gestures.

292
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,402
Kourtney's basically saying,

293
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,705
"Let me dangle this carrot
right in front of your face

294
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,673
and hope you don't ask me
any questions." Like...

295
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,243
It's a... Uh, it's very passive-aggressive.

296
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,612
Like, I feel, like,
"Does she want us to ask her?"

297
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,647
'Cause she's doing this right
in front of our face.

298
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,884
But then it's Kourt, so we can't ask her,
'cause she's so socially awkward.

299
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,455
[upbeat music]

300
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,996
{\an8}[yells]
Yeah!

301
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,498
-Dunk on 'em!
-[Gabbana whimpers]

302
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,967
[exhales sharply]
We got a win!

303
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,403
I want Khloé to hear herself

304
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,738
-screaming like an animal.
-Oh, my God!

305
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,707
-Don't film me!
-[all laugh]

306
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,343
-[Khloé] <i>We got a win!</i>
-Wait...

307
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,179
[Khloé] Don't film me!

308
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:19,084
[Kourtney] Oh, the slumber
party people are here!

309
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,021
-Yeah.
-Oh, I got to see this hair of yours.

310
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,289
If you're wearing a hat...

311
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,357
-I gotta see the haircut.
-I got to see what's happening.

312
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,227
-[Kourtney] Let's see it. Oh!
-What?

313
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,263
Oh, my God, you look so handsome.

314
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,632
Look at the big... Oh, you're wet.

315
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,867
-[Jonathan] It's so much better.
-[Khloé] What happened here?

316
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,904
-[Kourtney] Mason, you look so handsome.
-[Khloé] Let me see the big reveal.

317
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,172
[Jonathan] Oh, now, there goes the...

318
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,075
-Oh, now this one.
-Oh, I have two?

319
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,243
-And Reigny!
-Mase...

320
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,978
-Oh, three?
-Oh!

321
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,314
Oh... Ooh!

322
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,582
-You look so handsome.
-Wait!

323
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,617
What?

324
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,055
-That's heavy.
-Yeah, what's going on with your backpack?

325
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,023
What do you think
we're doing here tonight?

326
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,024
Having a sleepover.

327
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,760
-Oh, he's got a sweatshirt.
-A real sleepover?

328
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,630
-He's got cookies.
-You brought cookies?

329
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,433
-Those are good cookies, too.
-Oh, my goodness.

330
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,667
[Penelope] It's a party.

331
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,570
[Jonathan] Oh, my God.
I can't look... I can't...

332
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,572
[Khloé] Oh, there... with your ponytail.

333
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,074
[Kourtney] Yeah!

334
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,943
Is this not an angel straight from heaven?

335
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,812
-Like...
-No, I'm not.

336
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,080
He's a toy.

337
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,281
-He is.
-[Jonathan] He's a toy.

338
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,517
[Khloé] This is the first time
I've ever babysat the kids

339
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,219
so Kourtney could go on, like, a date.

340
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:31,323
And I am planning to do anything
that will entertain all these kids

341
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,094
in a safe way, where I could still
go to sleep at a normal hour.

342
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,365
Oh, that smells... delicious.

343
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,101
-Oh, is that from your friend?
-Want some?

344
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,803
-[Kourtney] She told me about it.
-[Penelope] Who?

345
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,439
[Kourtney] Her mommy.
Did you guys have fun?

346
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,408
Here, give me a kiss.

347
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,178
See you in the morning, okay?

348
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,716
Okay, we'll FaceTime in a little.
Okay, bye, Khlo, love you.

349
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,952
-[Khloé] Love you, Kourt. Have fun.
-[Kourtney] I'll call you in a little.

350
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,821
[hip-hop music]

351
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,028
{\an8}-[North] Hey, KoKo.
-[Khloé] Okay.

352
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,498
This is my cupcake,
then it's gonna be yours.

353
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,400
-Are you gonna make one for Mom?
-Yeah.

354
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,901
-Okay.
-[North] Pink.

355
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,471
-[Khloé] You should make one for Gabbana.
-[North] Dogs don't eat cupcakes.

356
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,242
[Khloé] Good, I was just tricking you
to see if you knew and you do.

357
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,243
[North blabbers]

358
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,445
[Kim] Mine's just gonna be
pink on pink on pink.

359
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,081
-Yeah.
-[Khloé] Where's Kourt?

360
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,583
[Kim] I don't know.
She said we can start without her.

361
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,818
[Khloé] Of course, she did.

362
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,654
North, if you want to work out,
you'll come and find us, okay?

363
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,523
[Kim] You want to work out, North?

364
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,358
She actually does like to.

365
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,127
-[Khloé] She does?
-She picks up the one pound and...

366
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,364
-All right, we'll be in the garage, okay?
-[North] This is my cupcake.

367
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,032
[Kim] Oh, it's gorgeous.

368
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:51,437
-[Khloé] Hey, Joe.
-[Joe] Girls, someone is missing, no?

369
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,773
You know, we only have control
over ourselves.

370
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,009
{\an8}-I can't tell you where Kourtney is.
-[Kim] So, I think we will leave her

371
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,177
{\an8}out of this one.

372
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,479
We can't wait any longer.

373
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,588
Oh, yeah! The walk of shame, right there.

374
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,258
-Kourtney. Did you wash your face today?
-What?

375
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,060
-No.
-[Khloé] I can tell!

376
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,664
[Joe] You can grab the weight
in front of you, ladies.

377
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,702
Overhead, lunges.
Three, two, one, and breathe.

378
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,171
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

379
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,673
So, what did you do last night?

380
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,245
We went to... um, see the swans.

381
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,881
That's where my blind date was,
with Tristan. How I met him.

382
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,982
-[Kim] No way. How funny...
-Oh, really?

383
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,817
Yeah, was it nice?

384
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,590
-Yeah.
-[Khloé] Good. I like it there.

385
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,427
I feel like Kourtney's always coy
about what she does, don't you?

386
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,529
Always. Like, doesn't say a word.

387
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:54,066
Doesn't divulge anything.
Is always just super chill.

388
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,102
It's really good.
I wish we were more like that.

389
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,538
But she just, like, giggles.
She'll look at her phone and she's like...

390
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,675
-Like, she's smiling from ear to ear.
-She won't pay attention to anything else.

391
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,177
'Cause she's just laughing on her phone.

392
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,614
How was last night? Did Mason go to bed?

393
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,183
Mason is great.

394
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,353
-But P...
-Mason is actually... Reign.

395
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,624
He was like a caged animal
that we let out for the night.

396
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,960
Kourtney, he rips my carpet,
'cause he was like, "Party!"

397
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,629
Just ripping, like, the fur.

398
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,865
He ripped a patch out of it.
He's literally like an animal.

399
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,600
-[Kourtney] He is.
-Like an Amazonian king.

400
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,336
[upbeat music playing]

401
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,444
I know that whenever I'm in town,
our schedules kind of conflict

402
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,015
and like, we don't get to see each other,
so I'm gonna clear my schedule

403
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,184
and spend the full week with you,
and we can bond

404
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,220
and then have... mommy-daughter time, and...

405
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,088
-I would love that.
-Okay.

406
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,258
{\an8}-[Khloé] Mom.
-I'm in the kitchen making brownies.

407
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:57,095
-Do you need me to help you in here?
-Uh. No, I'm gonna bring the stuff out.

408
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,865
[Kris] But I'm in a hurry.
I have a meeting to get to.

409
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,000
[Khloé] I wanted to have,
like, you and me time.

410
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,103
-I could help you with whatever you like.
-All right, plug this in.

411
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,041
I want you to get four eggs,

412
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,744
and put 'em in the blender.

413
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,084
You're gonna have to move, honey.
Got ten minutes.

414
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,588
[Khloé] Bonding time on a crunch.

415
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,991
You talk the talk and when it's time
to get down and dirty

416
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,726
and let's actually spend
the quality time, you're like,

417
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,294
-"Oh, no. I'm busy."
-Yeah.

418
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:33,932
All right, so, we're gonna take this.
They're called Mini Morsels.

419
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,369
-Smells yummy.
-Okay. Put your finger in there.

420
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,238
There you go. Good girl.

421
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,076
-Isn't that good batter?
-Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm!

422
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,077
No!

423
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,181
All right. So, the oven's on
and I like to do it in the...

424
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,983
-In the middle?
-...middle rack.

425
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,686
[Kris] Okay, 22 minutes on the clock.

426
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,622
Okay, Khloé.

427
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,292
I hate to be a buzz kill, but I got to go.

428
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,329
-We still, like, 18 minutes left.
-I know, so you'll stay here.

429
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,698
When the timer goes off,
just whip 'em out of the oven,

430
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,167
let them cool, cut 'em up
and put 'em on a cute plate.

431
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,237
I have to wait for the brownies
to be ready 'cause you have to run out.

432
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,106
Sometimes things just pop up.

433
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,308
[Kris] That's just what happens
when you're a mom,

434
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,543
and you have six kids
and six grandchildren.

435
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,878
But you can't bring me.

436
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,414
You could come, but then
who was gonna watch the brownies?

437
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,849
Humph. Okay.

438
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,484
Love you. Mwah.

439
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,821
[squeaky indistinct chatter]

440
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,757
-This is almost like a workout.
-[Penelope laughs]

441
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,393
-[Kourtney] Let's see it, Mase.
-[Kim] Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

442
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,694
[Joe] Push, push, push, push.

443
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:36,828
-[Kourtney] Yeah!
-[Kim] Kourt,

444
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,398
-do you think I look a little skinnier?
-Yeah, you do.

445
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,767
I've done, like, three days in a row,
an hour and a half.

446
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,869
-[Jonathan] Kim, let's go.
-[Kourtney] Where are you going?

447
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,270
-[Jonathan] Lunch.
-[Joe] Ready for the next one?

448
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,040
[Jonathan] Hi, Reign.
Do you remember my name?

449
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,441
Commercial.

450
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,077
-Commercial?
-What's his name?

451
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,514
-Commercial.
-His name is Commercial?

452
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,382
-Yes.
-What's his name? Jonathan.

453
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,118
-[Kim] Okay, Let's go.
-[Joe] Yes, that's it.

454
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,454
[ringtone playing]

455
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,223
[Kim] Hey, babe. What are you doing?

456
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,728
I know. They...

457
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,698
They posted it a while ago
and they just picked up on it.

458
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,167
So I said to Jonathan, "Why are they..."

459
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:19,304
And he's like, "Honestly, anything
that they find just for a minute,

460
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,572
they're just gonna harass you."

461
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,175
He's like, "You just have to, like,
cover it up and cover it up."

462
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,943
And I was like, "With the Met?

463
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,180
"Like, I thought that covered it up."
But I was, like, so annoyed.

464
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,816
Like, when will they stop with this story?

465
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:35,153
I guess it got so much attention for them,
they just won't let it down.

466
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:40,759
You definitely get a thick skin
once you have been through it a lot,

467
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:45,097
but pictures just keep coming out
every day and they won't let it go.

468
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:56,475
{\an8}I know I can handle anything
and everything and if I can't handle it...

469
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,876
Who can?

470
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,113
[Kim] I don't want to talk about this.
I'll see you when I get home.

471
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,914
-Okay. Bye.
-[Kanye] <i>All right. Okay.</i>

472
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,525
-[line rings]
-Why do I even buy half these things?

473
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,560
{\an8}-I get suckered into things.
-[Kris] <i>Hi.</i>

474
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,895
{\an8}Hi, Mom.

475
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,530
[Kris] <i>What are you doing?</i>

476
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,801
Well, I'm trying to clean out my closet.
I feel like I do this all the time,

477
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,804
but I feel like I have so much crap
that I don't really wear.

478
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,973
Like, what are you doing?
Do you wanna come over and help me?

479
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,475
This is so fun to do closet time.

480
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,311
[Kris] <i>I love closet time,
but to be honest,</i>

481
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,381
<i>I'm on my way to a meeting...</i>

482
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,786
<i>so I really can't do closet time today.</i>

483
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,189
<i>-Sorry, Khlo.</i>
-What about, like, tomorrow?

484
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,626
Would you want to do a workout with me?

485
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:48,794
We could work out.

486
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,564
Like, you say you want to, like,
get your summer '17 body right.

487
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,200
[Kris] <i>Yeah. I get really stressed out</i>

488
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,436
<i>because you're so much more
advanced than I am.</i>

489
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,871
-Stressed out?
-[Kris] <i>I just can't keep up with that.</i>

490
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,441
<i>And I also work out at, like, 5:00 am.</i>

491
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,910
I worked out today at 6:30.

492
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,447
[Kris] <i>I kind of like to do 5:00 am.</i>

493
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,650
-Okay.
-[Kris] <i>And get on the treadmill.</i>

494
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:15,086
<i>I'll tell you what. I got to go.
Somebody's here trying to talk to me.</i>

495
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,789
<i>So, I'll call you back
as soon as we make a plan, okay?</i>

496
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,659
But I'm trying to talk to you too.
I'm trying to make a plan.

497
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,563
[Kris] <i>I know, I know. I'll be right
back to you, okay, sweetheart?</i>

498
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,865
<i>I'll call you back.
I got to go take this other call.</i>

499
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,500
Okay. I'll hold my breath.

500
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,268
-[Kris] <i>Okay.</i>
-Great.

501
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,603
[line beeps]

502
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,638
[upbeat music playing]

503
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,541
[woman] You're so cute, Reigny!

504
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,948
[Kourtney] Which arm would you like to do?

505
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,316
This is like a lab here.

506
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,917
-[Kourtney] It is.
-This is not a house.

507
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,986
[Jonathan] See, I can't watch
the needle going in,

508
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,120
or the blood when I get it.

509
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,089
For the whole process,
from when they put this on,

510
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,525
my eyes stay closed until it's taken out.

511
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,528
You've been all over the press today.

512
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,363
-[Kourtney]I have?
-[Jonathan] Don't play stupid.

513
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,599
[Kourtney] I escaped the paps.
I thought I was free.

514
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,367
What do you mean? You're walking
in the middle of the street.

515
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,135
[Kourtney] No, I escaped them, though.

516
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,004
Well, it was inevitable at this point.

517
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,374
-Yeah.
-It's all done.

518
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,377
-Thank you very much.
-That's it. Oh, my God.

519
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,981
-Can't wait to get these results, guys.
-Oh, boy.

520
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,583
We'll see you here next week,
same time, same channel?

521
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,552
Yup, another test.
Another day, another test.

522
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,154
[Kourtney] I'm gonna eat my protein shake.

523
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,689
[Jonathan] And my salad is here.

524
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,358
We could eat at the same time.

525
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,960
-Can you do your hard-core shake?
-[Kourtney] Oh, yeah.

526
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:31,830
[Jonathan] Here we go.

527
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,968
You should do a salad workout video.

528
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,871
All right, there's gonna be nothing left.

529
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,973
{\an8}-[Kourtney] Do you want a real fork?
-Uh, yes.

530
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,410
I told Kanye about my dinner
and he was like, "I want to go."

531
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,779
And so, you think it's fine?

532
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,514
[Jonathan] Yeah. I don't know
why you're so worried about.

533
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,716
[Kim] I just am in the house so much

534
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,986
that I get so freaked out
if anyone, like, looks at me.

535
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,154
[Kim] Like, I'm nervous.

536
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,423
[Jonathan] I know but it's terrible now.

537
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,158
-Now you're getting a phobia about it.
-Oh, my god.

538
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,560
-[Jonathan] Like, stop.
-No, I have a full phobia.

539
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,128
I freak out about everything.

540
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:07,232
[Kourtney] But you know what?
It's your life and none of it matters

541
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,502
-what one person thinks about you.
-I go to Chrissy's house yesterday.

542
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,804
There's one photo of me
realizing paparazzi's there.

543
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,574
So I'm like this,
the worst photo of my face.

544
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,641
[Kourtney] That's funny.

545
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,811
No, no, no. I looked, like, 500 years old.

546
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,681
Like, my face was so ugly
and then it's on the media.

547
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,116
"Kim's aging.
Her face is so [bleep] ugly."

548
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,052
-Like, the worst story.
-[Kourtney] Don't look online.

549
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,823
[Kourtney] Why do you look on <i>Daily Mail,
TMZ, Us Weekly?</i>

550
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,191
'Cause that's like my life.

551
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,995
But I'm like, why do I subject myself
to be out and being seen?

552
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,531
-Why don't I just sit at home?
-[Kourtney] Why do you look online?

553
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,099
[Jonathan] Are you crazy?
You can't live in the house.

554
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,267
You're insane.

555
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,436
-What are you even saying?
-Yeah, but I just don't want any pictures.

556
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,440
Kim is really not over
these Mexico pictures.

557
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,242
-And I feel like this just set her back.
-Right.

558
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,580
{\an8}[lively music]

559
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,422
{\an8}[Kourtney] Oh, my God.
Wikipedia changed my height!

560
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,725
It's a big day.

561
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,426
-[Jonathan] Five-one you are.
-It is.

562
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,528
-I am five-one.
-[Jonathan] What was it before?

563
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:11,496
Five feet.

564
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,631
[Khloé snickers]

565
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,066
-Okay.
-[Kourtney] Grew a whole inch.

566
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,670
-Working out, green tea.
-[Khloé] Got stretched.

567
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:22,574
-You think from eating vegetables?
-[Kourtney] I think from just working out.

568
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,543
You got taller. Your posture,
you had horrible posture.

569
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,580
-That's really... what it is.
-Yeah. I still do, but it's better.

570
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,850
I just feel bad
that Kim is now so insecure.

571
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,885
[Khloé] Do you know what she wanted me
to do when we went to lunch?

572
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,087
Kim asked me if I could cover her back.
I said, "Why?"

573
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,189
She goes,
"'Cause it's so fat and so wide."

574
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,557
I was like, "Are you kidding?"

575
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,826
She literally has the body
of, like, a Barbie doll.

576
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,061
[Jonathan] She's been like this
in New York.

577
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,963
She doesn't want to go anywhere,
she doesn't want to do anything.

578
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,531
-I'm like, "What are you, sick?"
-[Khloé] But I get like that too

579
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:47,932
when I feel fatter, so I feel bad.

580
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,335
But I don't think anyone
should live life like that, and I get it.

581
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,738
Like, sometimes I... We all have our days
where we feel, like, ugly...

582
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,441
But she's Kim K.
She's like the baddest bitch in town.

583
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,443
-She's forgotten it.
-[Khloé] Still we all have those moments.

584
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,713
All she sees on her phone that comes up,
<i>Daily Mail, TMZ.</i>

585
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,049
[Jonathan] Guys, we need to disconnect her
from all social media

586
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,116
-for, like, four days...
-Yeah.

587
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,386
...so she, like, remembers how hot she is.

588
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,389
You can pick certain sites
that are not approved.

589
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,292
Right, so let's do, like,
all the "I Love Kim" sites.

590
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,795
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-[Khloé] How do you delete, like, Safari?

591
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,730
-[Kourtney] You can't.
-You can't?

592
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,699
-I'm sure you can.
-Why don't...

593
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:24,035
What if we could block a word?
I wonder if we could block anything

594
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,470
that has "Kim Kardashian."

595
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:29,674
Let's just delete stuff for, like, a day
so she could be like her again and forget.

596
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,310
-She'll get pissed and yell at someone.
-Well, we don't care.

597
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,945
I think it'll recalibrate her.

598
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,547
-I don't care what she says.
-[Khloé] Whoever taught you this word

599
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,915
-that you're just using...
-I love it.

600
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,116
...is absolutely amazing.

601
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:41,653
That was me. I taught myself these words.
That's what I do. Remember "dodo"?

602
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,987
[Khloé laughs]
I don't.

603
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,925
Ooh, I act... Does cellulite...
'Cause you know what I got?

604
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,427
A FasciaBlaster. Fascia, Fa...

605
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,963
-How do you say it, Alexa? FasciaBlaster?
-[Alexa] Yeah.

606
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,867
It gets rid of cellulite. I'm telling you.
You rub it on your body.

607
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,368
It's literally the most painful...

608
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,237
It's upstairs.
I could show you and do it to you.

609
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,639
-[Jonathan] Let's see it.
-[Khloé] Will you grab it for me?

610
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,309
-Oh, thank you. Oh, wow. I just need one.
-Whoa.

611
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:08,146
[Khloé] You rub this on your body, like,
really hard but you got to be naked.

612
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,514
And it breaks down the stuff

613
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,450
and you should see me naked
in my bed doing this.

614
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,687
-It looks like a very weird sexual thing.
-But has it helped?

615
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,822
I've only done it a few times
'cause it kinda hurts.

616
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,824
Will you take your jeans off
and I'll do this to you?

617
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,094
-[Jonathan] That'll be really fun.
-Got a thong on just for you, Khlo.

618
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:27,098
Oh, good! Lucky for us!
No, take your jeans off! I'm not...

619
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,968
What do you want me to do,
put this up your ass?

620
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,104
Okay, well, normally, I need oil.
Can you just like...

621
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:36,608
Don't do it to me with no oil
if you're supposed to put oil.

622
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:37,942
[chuckles]

623
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,078
-Rub her up.
-I thought you said oil.

624
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,314
Okay, it doesn't work.
It's whatever was accessible to me.

625
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:44,816
[Jonathan] I got Fascia...

626
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:49,254
[Khloé] Look, there's someone's
gonna think you have the softest body.

627
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,224
-It does not hurt whatsoever, by the way.
-'Cause I'm not doing it hard.

628
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,028
When you do it to yourself...
You really have no dimples, Kourt.

629
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,464
-You have no... no cellulite at all.
-[Khloé] Wow.

630
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,366
-You're like a smooth cappuccino.
-[Khloé] Look at this.

631
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,170
[upbeat music playing]

632
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,914
{\an8}-[Khloé] Mother?
-[Kris] Hi.

633
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:21,853
[in an accent] Hello, Mother.
It is our day to celebrate together.

634
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,557
-[normal voice] What's that face for?
-You're gonna die.

635
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,826
-I don't want to die.
-I feel so bad.

636
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,127
You're never gonna believe what happened.

637
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,530
So I have to leave
and go look at locations

638
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,098
for pop-up shops right now.

639
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,238
We planned to hang out together all day
and you always complain

640
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,908
that I'm always in Cleveland
and, like, I'm here just for you

641
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:48,146
'cause I can't hear that,
like, the guilt trips anymore.

642
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,648
[tense music]

643
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,920
The point was for us to be together.

644
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,191
I'm more like, you give me so much
[bleep] when I'm in Cleveland.

645
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,927
Like, literally, you make me feel so bad
and so guilty.

646
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,063
Like, I'm already away from the family.
I feel guilty.

647
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:09,033
Like, and I love being with you guys
but you give me so much [bleep].

648
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,069
I don't mean to make you feel guilty.

649
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,539
Sometimes I just miss you so much
and you're so far away.

650
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:18,176
I talk to you more in Cleveland
than I do in LA. Hope you know that.

651
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,379
I know. I'm so sorry.

652
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:26,351
I really am.
And I apologize, apologize, apologize.

653
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,552
I'm so sorry.

654
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,923
I do feel really guilty
about not spending time with you.

655
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,759
-I'm sorry, bunny.
<i>-Pobrecita.</i>

656
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,261
But it was a lesson learned.

657
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,631
I really want to do
something special with you.

658
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,267
-Can we hang out tomorrow?
-Yeah, I'm all yours.

659
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:46,004
-I'm in town just for you.
-You're just as cute as a button.

660
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,173
-I love you.
-I love looking like a butt'n.

661
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,843
It's not a butt'n. It's a button.

662
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,878
{\an8}-A but... No.
-A butt'n. I don't know.

663
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,480
{\an8}You were supposed
to leave five minutes ago.

664
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:01,286
For... Yikes. Okay. I really got...
Thank you, Matthew.

665
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,155
All right, I love you. You're adorable.

666
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:09,594
I got to go and I will see you.
Come on. Give me a little kiss.

667
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,762
Okay.

668
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,697
See? You can't do that on FaceTime.

669
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,900
[upbeat music playing]

670
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,543
{\an8}-[Khloé] Oh, you look gorgeous.
-Thank you.

671
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,613
-Wow. Look at that bod.
-Oh, my God.

672
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,716
-Hot and naughty.
-Did you do your makeup today?

673
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,786
-Yes, I did, I did it quickly.
-[Kourtney] Looks good.

674
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,756
-[Khloé] Why?
-There's just too much going on.

675
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:42,794
Will you come to my closet and help me,
like, filter a few things?

676
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:44,963
Yeah.

677
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,565
[Kourtney] Can I use your phone, though,
to call the kids?

678
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,534
Because no one was answering me.

679
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,601
Yeah.

680
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,670
[Kourtney] Kim is normally not
this insecure.

681
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,640
If she just didn't have access
to social media

682
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,976
or, you know,
stopped looking at the blogs,

683
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,945
I think that she would start
to feel better.

684
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:06,084
I feel like one of the best things she did
for herself after her Paris incident

685
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,988
was she really detached herself
from the internet and social media.

686
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:14,158
I think we kind of need to step in
and do something like that,

687
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,827
so she realizes this does not matter

688
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,063
and we need to take
just that bull[bleep] out of her life.

689
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:28,806
-What are you doing? Are you cleaning out?
-Just trying to get rid of some [bleep].

690
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,341
-Get rid of this stuff?
-[Khloé] Mm-hm.

691
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:33,911
Oh, I think those red thermals are
the coolest thing you have in this closet.

692
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,481
-I mean, I...
-You're keeping this?

693
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,483
-I like sequins.
-But you're not...

694
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,985
Why did I even offer this?

695
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,087
[Khloé] It's probably the worst idea
I've ever had,

696
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,455
because now I'm being tortured.

697
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,191
This is Jersey Shore on another level.

698
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,861
-This I've already worn.
-Everyone has.

699
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:52,130
I'm like, what the [bleep]
is taking you so long?

700
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,932
I mean, I'm not, like, a phone genius.

701
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,234
Like, I can't handle being alone

702
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,169
-with her in the closet.
-You should've told me that.

703
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,905
Kourt? I need to get my phone.

704
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,641
-Do you have my phone?
-Hold on. Yeah, I'm not done.

705
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,043
What are you doing?

706
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,815
{\an8}[Kim] Kourt? I need to get my phone.

707
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,651
-Do you have my phone?
-Hold on. Yeah, I'm not done.

708
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,621
What are you doing?
I thought you were calling the kids.

709
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:21,592
What is this? <i>TMZ? The Daily Mail?</i>
Blocking them?

710
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,328
[Kourtney] You can never go on these now.

711
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,463
Why?

712
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,001
Because you it consumes you
and it affects you.

713
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,237
-You deleted my apps?
-Oh, did I?

714
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,575
So, she tried to block me.

715
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,113
Yeah, but it's, like,
the healthiest thing for you.

716
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,116
She's doing it not from a malicious place.
She's trying to help you.

717
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,517
I'm not, like, a lunatic.

718
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,254
Yeah, but you have been letting
these things get into your soul.

719
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,823
Like, I don't want
to see things every day.

720
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,624
Like, Kendall even says
when she has, like, a problem,

721
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,194
she, like, erases the whole Twitter app
from her phone.

722
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,162
You just need to live your life

723
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,931
-and be happy.
-Don't you think it's good to be aware

724
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,032
-and in the know?
-No.

725
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,901
Why do you need to see this nonsense?

726
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,672
You can see your tagged photos
on Instagram, that's it.

727
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:11,109
-That's all you need to see.
-I look at them for news, too.

728
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,211
News about what?
What news are you learning?

729
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,413
[Kim] On <i>The Daily Mail</i>
is how I learn all my news.

730
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,215
-[Kourtney] No. No.
-Of what's going on in the world.

731
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,518
I don't read any news
and I'm fine and I'm happy.

732
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,887
I totally get,

733
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,656
like, how hurtful the comments are,
and it could get to you and it,

734
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,892
like, stays with you all day.

735
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,461
But out of anyone,
you've always been the one that, like,

736
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,330
that stuff doesn't bother you,
and you're like, "Who cares?"

737
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:36,601
Like, It's so small
in the grand scheme of life,

738
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,002
and these people, who are they?

739
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,139
And, like, today's news, like,
no one thinks about tomorrow.

740
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,608
I mean, you guys are right.

741
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,910
I do need to just, like,
let this not bother me

742
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,247
and just, like, not be a thing.

743
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:55,419
We were just trying to eliminate
any extra negativity from your life.

744
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,288
That's all we were trying to do.

745
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,124
I mean, I do understand that you guys
were just trying to help me.

746
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,125
Like, I get that.

747
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,695
-I don't need this negativity in my life.
-I agree.

748
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,831
So let Kourtney block your phone.

749
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:10,101
I'll live like this for, like, two days
and see how I feel.

750
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,602
And then I'll unblock you.

751
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,671
I'm sure you'll still weasel
your way somewhere.

752
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:22,914
Oh, my God.

753
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,584
-[Brittni] Hello! Welcome.
-Hi, how are you?

754
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,519
{\an8}-Good. How are you guys?
-Good. Thank you.

755
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,221
{\an8}-This is so nice.
-Isn't it cute?

756
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,156
{\an8}This is so pretty.

757
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,592
I think it's amazing
that Khloé has come home

758
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,596
to spend some time with me
and I'm feeling guilty as [bleep].

759
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,800
-Khloé, this is so exciting.
-We're having a little date.

760
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,404
-Look at that little car back there.
-Yeah, you like these little cars.

761
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,541
[Kris] Khloé and I, we like to do
really silly things together.

762
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,977
-<i>Es la verdad.</i>
-I think it means you're horny.

763
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,048
Oh, my God, Khloé, stop.

764
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,250
[gibbers]
A walkie-talkie?

765
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:03,421
So how better to make up
than to surprise her with a wine tasting?

766
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,625
This is our Saddlerock Rosé and Zinfandel.

767
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,127
-[Kris] Nice.
-You're gonna get strawberry on the nose,

768
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,463
watermelon on the palate,
with a cranberry finish.

769
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,465
-[Khloé] Looks so good.
-Cheers.

770
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,901
What was she saying,
"strawberries on the nose"?

771
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,470
I have no idea
what that [bleep] language was.

772
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,607
And a "cranberry finish."
What the [bleep] are you talking about?

773
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,245
Mmm. Oh.

774
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,349
Could we also get a glass of Chardonnay?

775
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,252
-A wine of a different color.
-Yeah.

776
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,758
-Cheers to you.
-Cheers to that. I love you!

777
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,229
-We're having fun!
-Oh, this is so fun!

778
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,969
We're drinking a lot of wine.

779
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,973
I'm getting confused
because that's your side of the table.

780
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,376
[Kris] We should do prank calls.

781
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,444
-What?
-We should do prank calls.

782
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,580
[sniffles]
Hey, Siri.

783
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,514
No, no. Here.

784
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,183
-Siri! Siri!
-Hold on. Give me your...

785
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,452
-You got to... you can't just talk to them.
-[phone beeps]

786
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,322
-Siri, could you please call the hotel?
-[line rings]

787
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,028
[Cara] <i>Good afternoon. This is Cara.
How can I direct your call?</i>

788
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:20,631
Hello. Can I please
have Khloé Kardashian's room?

789
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,869
<i>I don't see that I have her registered
as a guest here at the hotel.</i>

790
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:30,908
Oh, that's wild! I think she's under a...
I don't know, like, another name.

791
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:35,913
I think it's something like Funny Bunny...
or Fred Flintstone.

792
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,050
That's the two that I know
she normally goes under.

793
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:43,954
Oh, my God, your prank calls,
honestly, are the best.

794
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,189
You have me crying.

795
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:49,527
Hi. I'm calling
from London's Daily Pastry and Cake.

796
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:55,366
I was just trying to follow up
on a story that you provided

797
00:38:55,433 --> 00:39:01,272
all of Khloé Kardashian's pastries
for Thanksgiving a couple of years back.

798
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,007
[man] <i>Okay.</i>

799
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,210
I heard that it was
the delicious pumpkin pie.

800
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:10,514
[man] <i>The pumpkin pie, yeah,
it's our... it's our seasonal, um,</i>

801
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:13,150
<i>pie that we have
at Thanksgiving and Christmas.</i>

802
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,819
What else is seasonal?

803
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:18,356
[man] <i>We also have a strawberry
rhubarb pie hat's only, uh, in stock...</i>

804
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,592
<i>it's only in season
during the summer for some reason.</i>

805
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,196
I buy strawberries all year round.
Is it just the rhubarb,

806
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,164
-or, like...
-[man] <i>I think it's just the rhubarb.</i>

807
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,633
Okay, can I just ask you
a personal question?

808
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,103
-Oh, my God.
-So, how do you spell rhubarb?

809
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,474
[man] <i>It's all mixed within the batter
for the pie.</i>

810
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,243
-Do you happen to know of a toe-ologist?
-[laughs]

811
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,612
My foot is killing me.

812
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,448
[man] <i>No, I've never heard of that.</i>
[chuckles]

813
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,817
-Are you sure?
-[man] <i>Yeah.</i>

814
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,653
-Okay, well, maybe I'll ask the concierge.
-[bleep]

815
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,156
-[man] <i>No problem.</i>
-Okay, well, thank you so much.

816
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,492
-You've been delightful.
-[man] <i>No problem, ma'am.</i>

817
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,560
-<i>I hope you have a good day.</i>
-Okay. Thanks.

818
00:39:56,627 --> 00:40:00,131
He gets an A
for customer service, seriously.

819
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,033
-He is literally needs a raise.
-The guy's delightful.

820
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,802
-The next time you come into town...
-Mm-hm.

821
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,538
...I'm gonna make a much better effort
to try to see you much more

822
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,173
-and clear my schedule completely.
-Mom!

823
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,708
I'm not tripping, boo.

824
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,577
I'm good,
but I get it, you're a boss lady.

825
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,147
-Mom.
-[Kris clears throat]

826
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,216
-Mom?
-Yeah?

827
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,484
It's two o'clock.

828
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,788
-Cheers to that.
-Cheers.

829
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,756
-[clinks]
-Cheers to that.

830
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,792
That's what this episode's
gonna be called.

831
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,326
"Cheers to That."

832
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:30,728
Oh, my God.

833
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:31,929
[line ringing]

834
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,764
-[Farnaz] <i>Hello?</i>
-Hello.

835
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,434
{\an8}-[Farnaz] <i>Hello.</i>
-Same voice?

836
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,071
{\an8}-[Farnaz] <i>Who's this?</i>
-Bonnie.

837
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,240
[Farnaz] <i>Who?</i>

838
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,876
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Bonnie.

839
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,181
{\an8}[Farnaz] <i>Ha, ha, ha...</i>

840
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,450
[Farnaz] <i>I... got to go.</i>

841
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,553
<i>Hello?</i>

842
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,789
{\an8}[Kourtney] <i>On the next episode...</i>

843
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:02,927
{\an8}-What are Kendall and I gonna do alone?
-Kourt thinks Kendall doesn't like her.

844
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,895
{\an8}I've never gotten this drunk off of wine.

845
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,567
{\an8}I'm gonna go to Khloé's house,
totally pack for her.

846
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,169
{\an8}This is like five animals in one,
a zebra, a pelican.

847
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,004
{\an8}Cheesy as [bleep].

848
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,873
{\an8}This is not the suitcase I packed.

849
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,443
{\an8}-Everyone's worried about you.
-I definitely am out of control.

850
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,012
{\an8}This cycle is not beneficial to anybody.

851
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,548
{\an8}No, I don't want the kids
to see him like this.
