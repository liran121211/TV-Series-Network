00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:11,745
-[piano keys playing]
-Oh, wow. You're so good.

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,547
[Khloé] Good job.

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:16,850
-No.
-Does your...

5
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,785
Does your mom believe
in air conditioning or no?

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,187
-Uh-uh. I'm super sweaty on my neck.
-No.

7
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,355
[laughs]

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,791
-[Jonathan] What's sweaty on her neck?
-[Penelope] I'm hot.

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,126
[Khloé] I'm always hot here.

10
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,262
-[low melody playing on piano]
-[Penelope] A violin.

11
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,098
This is Mom's theme music

12
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,034
-when she comes down the stairs.
-Play this song.

13
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,704
[Kourtney] That was cute though.

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:42,008
Jonathan, you guys, if anyone
ever needs advice, Jonathan's the one.

15
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,343
[Kim] Why do you think I torture him?

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,211
Why do you think he's, like,
number one on my speed dial?

17
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,014
[Khloé] You know what I love about you?
I remember when you hated Jonathan.

18
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,084
-I hated Steph and Jonathan.
-[Khloé] Hated Steph and now look at you.

19
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,419
-[Kim] Yeah.
-[Khloé sneezes]

20
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,220
-[Kourtney] Bless you.
-[Kim] Bless you. <i>Gesundheit.</i>

21
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,990
-Who says <i>gesundheit?</i>
-[Jonathan] Bless you.

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,958
-[quirky music]
-A lot of people.

23
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,694
-<i>Gesundheit.</i>
-[Jonathan] <i>Gesundheit</i> from Yiddish.

24
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:02,996
-[Kim] Yiddish?
-[Jonathan] Yeah.

25
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,697
[Kim] What the [bleep] is Yiddish?

26
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,534
Yiddish. Like a different version

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,735
-of Hebrew. No...
-It's like British.

28
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:09,803
[laughter]

29
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,238
-[Jonathan] It is absolutely not.
-[Khloé] Yiddish is British?

30
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,442
Wait, Yiddish is a real thing?
It's not, like, gibberish?

31
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,311
-[Jonathan] No, Yiddish is real.
-[Kim] That's funny.

32
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,479
[Khloé laughs]

33
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,548
[theme music]

34
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,370
{\an8}[Kourtney]
Today, we're speaking in French.

35
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,072
{\an8}[Joel] In French? Just in French?

36
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:46,973
{\an8}[Kourtney] So I can see

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,708
{\an8}-how my French skills are.
-It's up to you.

38
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,643
{\an8}[Khloé] But why are you learning French?

39
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,113
{\an8}Why all of a sudden...

40
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:56,382
{\an8}-at the ripe old age of...
-Why did you want to learn Spanish, Khloé?

41
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,151
{\an8}Well, we've always taken Spanish classes.

42
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,254
I've always taken French too.
I took French in the eighth grade.

43
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,656
[quirky music]

44
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,759
-[Khloé] Why the resurgence of it now?
-Because I have a French trainer.

45
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:10,964
Or could it be...
that your boyfriend is French?

46
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,934
[Joel] <i>Donc, on va sauter la corde
pendant deux minutes.</i>

47
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,770
-[Khloé] Jump rope for two minutes.
-Yeah. That's it.

48
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,572
<i>Pendant deux minutes. C'est parti.</i>

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,874
[gadget beeps]

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,375
We start now.

51
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,677
Okay, what can you say in French?

52
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,280
So far, he's speaking,
but what are you doing?

53
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,483
-[Kourtney] So far, I read French.
-[Joel] Okay. <i>Deux, un.</i>

54
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,852
-Here. <i>Vingt</i> squats.
-[gadget beeping]

55
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,156
<i>Un, deux, trois.</i>

56
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,492
-Copy his counting. What's wrong with you?
-[Joel] <i>Cinq, six, sept.</i>

57
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,261
-[Khloé] Say it!
-Shut up.

58
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,665
What's wrong with you though?
You have a trainer, a teacher right here.

59
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,735
-[Joel] Let's go.
-I don't understand.

60
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,236
You wouldn't, Khloé.

61
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,039
[quirky music continues]

62
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,009
-[Khloé] You freak.
-<i>Et c'est la dernière série.</i>

63
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,478
-This is the last set.
-Me arse...

64
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,347
-[Joel] <i>Dernière série.</i>
-[Khloé] <i>Dernière série.</i>

65
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,316
[Joel] <i>Dernière série.</i> Yeah.

66
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,319
[upbeat music]

67
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,060
{\an8}[Kourtney] So I do like this. I tried it
on today for Patrick. He liked it.

68
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,763
{\an8}But so when Kylie and I
were speaking the other day,

69
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,832
she was like, "I really think you need
something that's different.

70
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,401
Like, people want to buy."

71
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,638
We're trying to make some metals
that are... that are vamp but not black.

72
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,208
-[Kris] Hi.
-What if we did our red a metal?

73
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,142
[woman] Ooh.

74
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,844
-[Kris] Are you done with this food?
-I'm done.

75
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,514
You're done? You don't want the pasta?

76
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,683
-No, thank you.
-Kourt.

77
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:37,750
[Kourtney] Oh.

78
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,321
[Kim] Hey.

79
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,858
So, Saint, last night, at, like,
5:00 in the morning, I heard him talking

80
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,361
and I'm like, "What is he saying?"

81
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:54,467
And he was like, "Dada. Dada.
Shoes. Shoes, Dada."

82
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,004
And I'm like, "What is he dreaming about?
Like, Yeezys?"

83
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,038
[Khloé] Yeezys.

84
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,708
Like, it's his favorite thing, is shoes.
He'll see someone's shoes

85
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,977
-and just be like, "Shoes."
-[Khloé] He's so cute.

86
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,112
All right, guys,
I gotta go sit in with Kylie.

87
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,348
[Khloé] What? You've never been
to one of my...

88
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,384
Literally, I don't think you've been
to one of my Good American meetings ever.

89
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,119
[Kris]
I have been to a Good American meeting.

90
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,420
You never come to my makeup meetings.

91
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,357
-Yes, I do. I get you off and running.
-[Khloé] Off and running?

92
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,525
Kylie's not off and running?
It's been 18 months.

93
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,762
-[Kim] She's just your favorite.
-[Khloé] Yeah, and Kim's not anymore.

94
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,398
-[Kim] It's fine. Kylie makes...
-More money.

95
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,866
-Yeah. She makes more money right now.
-No. You guys.

96
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,568
That's a horrible thing to say.

97
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:32,405
This is the perfect example
of why Kylie's so much nicer to me

98
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,107
and why I spend more time with her.

99
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,708
-Right.
-You give me such [bleep]

100
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,245
and she's so sweet to me all the time
and does such nice things and cares.

101
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,314
[quirky music]

102
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,550
Kim has been my mom's favorite since...

103
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,153
-A decade strong.
-I would say longer than that.

104
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,988
-Really?
-Like, literally since you were born.

105
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,025
But now she kind of has been, like,

106
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,227
weaning herself off of you a little bit

107
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,663
-and she's been latching onto Kylie now.
-Totally.

108
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,099
I love a good colander
'cause you can get a facial, look. Facial.

109
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,567
{\an8}-Facial.
-I do the same thing!

110
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,536
-Are we the same person?
-I think we are.

111
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,673
-Look what I brought you.
-You're so cute!

112
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,907
[laughter]

113
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,843
We're stuck together forever.

114
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,545
[Khloé]
Why is it fun to be Mom's favorite?

115
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,213
I don't know what that's like, so...

116
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,616
I don't know.
She just puts in a lot of attention.

117
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,119
She always builds you up,
makes you feel confident.

118
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,654
I don't know any of these things.

119
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,890
[Khloé] I just want to see what it takes
to be the favorite.

120
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:24,924
[Kim] Good luck.

121
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,194
Kylie's just so nice to me all the time.

122
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,265
She'll buy me little fun things
to let me know she's thinking about me.

123
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,434
[Kim] So we have to buy you
to get you to like us more.

124
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,736
-[Kris] No, but you know what I mean.
-[Kim] Wait a minute,

125
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,805
we threw you your 60th birthday party.

126
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,073
[Khloé] Yes, we did.

127
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,210
I wouldn't say Kendall or Kylie
even had a thought about that party.

128
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:48,648
We threw your 60th birthday and we busted
our ass to do it, the three older girls.

129
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,184
And we were dealing with other crises
at the same time

130
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,386
and we still managed to do it.
We bought you

131
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,154
-your [bleep] memories.
-[Kim] Your memories.

132
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,990
Yes, we're on the same page. Memories.

133
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:02,295
It sounds like you two are a little jelly.
That's all I'm saying.

134
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,063
[Kris] All right,
I have to go to my meeting.

135
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,798
It's right over here if you need me

136
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,401
and right now,
you guys are tied for my least favorite.

137
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,904
-How about that?
-"How about that? How about that?"

138
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,474
[Khloé] I really do think Mom likes me
the best though, out of us.

139
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,008
[Kim] Really? I don't think so.

140
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,878
I think that you're in Cleveland
all the time, so...

141
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,413
[Khloé]
So she doesn't like me 'cause of that?

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,915
No, it's just like, you know,
I spend more time with her.

143
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,184
I just think
that I'm, like, always with her.

144
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,719
-[Kim] So...
-Well...

145
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,155
[Kim] Go back to Cleveland, honey.

146
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,757
[chuckles]
Don't you worry.

147
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,459
<i>Do I look scary?</i>

148
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,828
[Kim] <i>Does anybody know where North is?
I can't find her.</i>

149
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,531
-[North] <i>Hello!</i>
-[Kim] <i>Oh, wait, the blanket talks?</i>

150
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,700
{\an8}<i>-Look at my little pretty kitty.
-Meow.</i>

151
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,636
{\an8}[Reign] Uh-oh!

152
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,204
{\an8}-Reigny.
-[Reign babbles]

153
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,707
-Who is this cute boy?
-[Kim] Reigny.

154
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,675
[Kourtney cackles]

155
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,615
You're never gonna get in trouble
'cause of that dimple right there.

156
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:01,354
Do you think you feel like one is left out
because there's an odd number of kids?

157
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,622
This guy.

158
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:03,923
[Reign babbles]

159
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,392
But him and P
spend a lot of time together.

160
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,228
I think I should have three more kids.

161
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,329
[Kourtney chuckles]

162
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,864
-Three more?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

163
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,233
-Like, you would carry them yourself?
-Yeah.

164
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,336
That's wild.
I think I would do just one more.

165
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,374
But I need to decide, like, ASAP
if we're gonna have another one.

166
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,076
[Kim] Or we're gonna lose our surrogate.

167
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,344
-Really?
-[Kim] Mm-hmm.

168
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,514
Kanye and I have always talked
about having more kids,

169
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,851
but I've gone through so much
with really bad deliveries

170
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,788
that the doctors don't feel like it's safe
for me to carry my own baby.

171
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,658
[doctor] You had toxemia.
You had a retained placenta.

172
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,559
Very traumatic.

173
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,729
The doctor is like, "For sure now,
you should not carry another baby."

174
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,432
Kanye and I are just gonna,
like, look into other options

175
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,234
and see what we're comfortable with.

176
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,205
But getting a surrogate
and finding someone that you really trust

177
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,975
really is so much more difficult
of a situation

178
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,077
than you could really imagine.

179
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,481
You have to, like, make sure
that their lifestyle is healthy

180
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,550
and they have to go through
psychological testing.

181
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,453
And it was, like, maybe a year
before we actually

182
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,555
finalized our current situation.

183
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,891
But I think
everything happens for a reason

184
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,261
because the surrogate that I really love
got approved.

185
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,265
And she's such a nice person.
Like, she's so easy to talk to,

186
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,567
and she's the perfect fit for us.

187
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,837
But we have to decide quickly,
are we really gonna go through with this

188
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,708
or are we gonna wait
until we feel more prepared?

189
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:33,179
So, Reign, you want to take a nap?
I'll take one with you.

190
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,682
Reigny, you want a nap-nap?
You want to go night-night?

191
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,485
-[Reign] Um, no.
-[Kim] I'll go night-night.

192
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,087
Should I go night-night in your bed?

193
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,923
Um, no. I need the bed.

194
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,361
[upbeat music]

195
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,671
{\an8}I know my mom has been complaining
about this pantry,

196
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:02,074
{\an8}and she loves mine, so we're gonna try
to emulate this as much as possible.

197
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,409
{\an8}She's just a hoarder.

198
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,545
{\an8}[Jenna] She wants it exactly like yours.

199
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,146
{\an8}[Khloé] She's so funny.

200
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,181
So what I did, like, I planned out.

201
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,951
Like, I was like, "Okay, I have
this many cookies that I like in here,

202
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,621
this many nuts." And I put
everything together in one shelf.

203
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,623
Then I was like,
"This is a great spice shelf.

204
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,326
-This is a great cookie shelf."
-[Jenna] Okay.

205
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,129
My mom loves organizing, just like I do

206
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,264
and she always comes to my house

207
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,733
and says, "Oh, my God, Khloé,
you're so good at this."

208
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,402
[Khloé] Raw almonds, roasted almonds,

209
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,503
-candy pecans.
-Yeah.

210
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,172
So I decide,
as a very nice, sweet gesture,

211
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,242
let me go into her kitchen,
into her pantry,

212
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,911
reorganize it, KhloCD it up.

213
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,514
It's just the gift that keeps on giving.

214
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,683
This is, like, ridiculous,
how much [bleep] this woman has.

215
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,985
Like, this is crazy.
And I have a lot of [bleep].

216
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,653
What the [bleep] is this?

217
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,956
[Khloé] What is that, a cock ring?
Like, come on.

218
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,057
[Kris] Uh...

219
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,625
[Khloé] Oh, hi!

220
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,360
What's going on?

221
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,930
-What are you doing here?
-[Khloé] Organizing your pantry.

222
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,365
What did I do to deserve this?

223
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,034
-This is my dream come true.
-I know!

224
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,603
-[Kris] No, this is seriously...
-[Khloé] No, wait, look.

225
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,439
This is gonna be a display here,
like how mine is out.

226
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,673
[Kris] Yes.

227
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,408
'Cause this is
where all of your [bleep] is.

228
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,676
-Okay.
-So...

229
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,579
That's your coffee,
and then you make your tea here.

230
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,081
-[Khloé] So we're gonna get dividers.
-[Kim] Hello.

231
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,316
And you're gonna keep
your tea and everything here.

232
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,885
-That is so smart.
-[Kim] Special delivery.

233
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,987
[Kris] What?

234
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,956
-Hansen's.
-[Kris] You brought a Hansen's cake?

235
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,324
Wait, I'm not done showing you.

236
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,226
-[Kim] Oh, yeah.
-Wait a second.

237
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,328
[Kris] Oh, my God, it's the basketweave.

238
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,365
-[Kim] It's your fave. I know you.
-[Kris and Khloé] What does it say?

239
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,033
It says, "I love you, Mom."

240
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,901
-Why?
-Oh, my God. Thank you.

241
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,571
-What do you mean, why?
-You're such a kiss-ass.

242
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,340
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, and it's black and white.

243
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,476
Okay, wait, but let me just show you
over here real quick.

244
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,944
I love that cake.

245
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,146
So instead of putting
all the sugars over there

246
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,181
on that bottom drawer,
we're gonna get you dividers,

247
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,651
-and put all your sugar packets here.
-[Kim] What are you guys doing?

248
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,453
-It's gonna save so much space.
-She redid my entire pantry for me,

249
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,690
which has been, like, my dream come true
for as long as I've lived here.

250
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,058
It's her dream come true.

251
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:04,697
Who knew that me mentioning
that Kylie was being so nice to me

252
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,100
would result in them being
even nicer to me?

253
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,872
This is seriously the nicest thing
and the cake's the nicest thing.

254
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,707
[whispers]
[bleep]

255
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,543
This is actually working out in my favor.

256
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,714
[Kris] Is this Be Sweet to Mommy Day
or something?

257
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:26,519
First, Kylie shows up out of the blue
and got me a massage.

258
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,421
-That was nice.
-[Kris] I'm one lucky mom.

259
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,524
-I really am. You guys are the best.
-[Khloé] Kylie knows how to live.

260
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,960
You really are,
and I'm so excited about my pantry.

261
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,329
Love it, love it, love it.

262
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,465
It really means a lot to me.
It really does.

263
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,334
And the fact
that the plastic bags are over there

264
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,737
and that kind of stuff is over there,
that you found

265
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,906
-little nooks and crannies for this stuff...
-I know!

266
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,574
...is genius.

267
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,409
-So genius?
-Is it? It is.

268
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:54,280
[Kim] All right, have fun organizing
this disgusting mess.

269
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,115
[Kris laughs]

270
00:11:56,182 --> 00:12:00,119
Thanks for leaving your Hansen's box
on the floor. [bleep] cake.

271
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:03,923
Oh.

272
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,192
[laughter]

273
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,394
<i>This is legit how I feel inside, okay?</i>

274
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,832
{\an8}I'm trying to pick eight nudes
but I don't know...

275
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,400
But why do you put them on her?

276
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,836
-Where else are we gonna put them?
-Yeah, where else are we...

277
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,637
Amazing.

278
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,339
-[Kim] Do you like them?
-[Stephanie] I do.

279
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:22,742
[Khloé] What is all this?

280
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,877
Just mini earrings.

281
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,913
[Khloé] They're so little.
Where do these go? In your ear?

282
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,216
-These are little hoops?
-Yeah, I like little, tiny hoops.

283
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,685
Holy cow. Well,
we are completely two different girls,

284
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,454
-with my hoops and your hoops.
-Why did they order all of these?

285
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,123
I'm so confused.

286
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,926
Anyways, Kourtney's... shh...
secretly learning French.

287
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,962
All of a sudden,
at the ripe old age of 38,

288
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,997
she wants to venture out
to a new language.

289
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,500
-She's not learning French, you guys.
-[Khloé] She's learning French.

290
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:48,567
She made Joel start doing...

291
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,669
[Kim] Joel do the whole workout in French.

292
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,471
-You're lying.
-[Khloé] Obviously, we all know

293
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,673
that this is for her little friend.

294
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,042
Why else would she
all of a sudden think to do this?

295
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,880
-Okay. This is all very new to me.
-So she hasn't said any of this to you?

296
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,782
-She has not told me.
-[Khloé] She's like a vault.

297
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,451
She doesn't say anything about it.
She really doesn't.

298
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:09,355
-She's so not like that normally.
-And now it's, like, a vacation and, uh...

299
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,090
[Khloé] And another vacation
and another vacation.

300
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,024
And another one.

301
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,126
-She's getting very invested.
-[Stephanie] I know.

302
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,261
I know.

303
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:19,865
Why, when it's me, when you guys find
paparazzi pictures of me with Tristan,

304
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,702
you guys, literally, like,
stone me until I answer you?

305
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,005
But when it's Kourtney,
we're like, I'm doing it too,

306
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,140
we're like, "Ooh, her friend."

307
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,477
She won't even say his name,
which blows my mind. Like...

308
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,213
"Let's say his name now.
We don't have to be quiet about it."

309
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,916
[Stephanie] I mean, maybe we just want
to keep it, so that it's like,

310
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,851
"Oh, it's just a little thing.
It doesn't matter,

311
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,085
it doesn't matter. Let's not..."

312
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,453
Well, you weren't around
when Scott started.

313
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,689
-[Khloé] She's doing the same thing.
-Right.

314
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,191
Ten and a half years later.

315
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,361
What is wrong with us? We enable her.

316
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,163
-Let's catch Kourtney.
-[Khloé] Huh?

317
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,567
-[Kim] Let's catch Kourt.
-Okay. Buckle up, kids.

318
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,004
{\an8}[rhythmic music]

319
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,007
{\an8}Oh, I love the gifts you guys got me.

320
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,809
-Hey.
-Hi!

321
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,979
[Kourtney] Did you see my snaps yesterday?

322
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,682
-No. Come on in, Kim.
-[Kourtney] What? You didn't?

323
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,717
[Khloé] I know you want it, Kim.

324
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,186
You better watch them now
before they go away.

325
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,355
[Khloé] Oh, my God, I didn't know.

326
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,824
-[Kourtney] It's gone.
-[Khloé] 22 hours ago?

327
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:19,892
You missed it.

328
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,429
-[Kourtney] You missed it all.
-What was it?

329
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,831
I was hanging out in your closet.

330
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,235
<i>I think I'm just going to hang out
in Khloé's closet all day.</i>

331
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:33,405
<i>Wouldn't this be fun? Closet goals.</i>

332
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,474
<i>You're lucky we're not the same size shoe,</i>

333
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,912
<i>but if you happen to be missing any bags,
it wasn't me.</i>

334
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:45,351
Kylie's wearing my Dolce & Gabbana
runway boots that have never been worn.

335
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,820
[Khloé] I'm like, this is what happens
when I'm out of town?

336
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,089
-You guys go through my closets?
-She went to your house?

337
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:53,125
I mean, it's fine.
She gave me a Lip Kit deal.

338
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,695
Like, what am I supposed to do?
I'm, like, indebted.

339
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,897
[Kim] Not really.

340
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,865
So, I, um...

341
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,070
Top secret, but I, uh,
my surrogate passed all of her tests,

342
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,375
so she starts the pill tomorrow.

343
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,243
-[Kourtney] What pill?
-[Kim] Birth control.

344
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:16,315
When you do fertility, they need you
to be on the pill for one week

345
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,985
and then get off and then you get
your period, implant the embryo.

346
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,021
So are you doing this for sure?

347
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:23,555
[Kim] Yeah.

348
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,291
-[Kourtney] This is so exciting.
-Oh, my God.

349
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,558
It's so wild.

350
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,530
[Kim] I definitely had a hard time
making this decision.

351
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,466
Should I do it? Shouldn't I do it?
What do we really want?

352
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,637
This particular surrogate,
she was the best fit for our family,

353
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,707
so we just had to go with it
and try one embryo.

354
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,976
Should we start this workout, guys?

355
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,814
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

356
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,216
[thrilling music]

357
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,353
[Kim] <i>Look at them, snapchatting.
We're trying to work out.</i>

358
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,389
-<i>I'm trying to play the music.</i>
-[Kim] <i>No, you're snapchatting.</i>

359
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,025
[barking softly]

360
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:04,663
Khloé, we have Saks Fifth Avenue
to ourselves!

361
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,833
Well, if you keep screaming,
they're gonna kick you out.

362
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,036
I figure I got to step it up
to be my mom's favorite.

363
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,304
I'm going full throttle.

364
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,041
So yesterday, I got her the best gift,
this hyperbaric chamber.

365
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,978
{\an8}[salesman] So you got to turn this on,
right down here.

366
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,380
I can do this so far.

367
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,583
[Khloé] You lay in it for a little bit
and you better just have some Zen time.

368
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,620
-[Kris] Hello, hello, hello! Oh.
-[Khloé] No, we can just talk normal.

369
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,889
I can hear you fine.

370
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,625
And today,
I'm taking my mom to Saks Fifth Avenue,

371
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,295
and I cleared the entire place out.

372
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,098
[Khloé] So Saks is shut down
just for my mom and I.

373
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,368
Let's start at sunglasses.

374
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,103
-Those are great on you.
-[Kris] They feel crooked.

375
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,371
-Wait, but do they...
-[salesman] They feel crooked?

376
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,605
-I can get a fresh pair.
-Open.

377
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,173
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my God.

378
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,442
-[Khloé] They open.
-These are my new favorite thing ever.

379
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,410
[salesman laughs]

380
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,480
-[Khloé] How cute are these?
-[Kris] Those are great.

381
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,316
-[Khloé] They're so cute.
-[Kris] We need these.

382
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,051
[Khloé]
I have matching sunglasses with mom?

383
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,319
[Kris] Yeah, it's mother-daughter.

384
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,821
[Khloé] Mom, do you like that Gucci bag?

385
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,824
[Kris] I have red, but I really like
the one with the little...

386
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:06,792
-[Khloé] Bow?
-...bow.

387
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:11,764
I really appreciate you, like,
spending time with me and doing this.

388
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:16,769
This would be so good on you, Khloé,
because of your height.

389
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,904
[Khloé] Oh, it is kind of cute.
You should get that.

390
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,272
[Kris] There's two of them.

391
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,676
[salesman] Hey, guys.
You guys look like twins. Perfect.

392
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,677
We are twins.

393
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,246
-[salesman] Look how beautiful.
-I know.

394
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,682
We look so cute, we could go out
on, like, a mother-daughter date.

395
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,384
-In the same outfit?
-Yes.

396
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,586
-Those are must-haves for both of you.
-[Kris] Yes.

397
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,456
My mom's other kids are dead to her
after this Saks trip.

398
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:42,528
I mean, this is...
Who could get this? Ever? Only me.

399
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,630
So you're welcome, Mom. I love you.

400
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,232
[Kris] Best day ever.

401
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,235
[Khloé] Yeah, you're lucky 'cause shopping
with Kim would be the worst.

402
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:51,904
I'm way nicer.

403
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,775
[upbeat music]

404
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,050
{\an8}[Joel] Step up on the bench and press.

405
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,453
-[exhales deeply]
-[Joel] Switch.

406
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,622
Let's see if this one could do the same.

407
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,428
One. Yeah. One. Drop the weight.

408
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,165
Yeah, let's go. One more.

409
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,304
[Khloé] Hey. Hold on. Can't hug you.

410
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,339
[Kourtney] You're, like,
dripping with sweat.

411
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,476
-[Khloé] We're working out.
-Okay, I'm gonna just rest.

412
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,477
[Khloé] What?

413
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,312
On this bench.

414
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,248
I literally have in my notes section
on my phone...

415
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,283
-[Kourtney] Yeah?
-...a list of questions to ask you.

416
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,421
-Other leg, right?
-Yeah. Opposite one. Right arm.

417
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,356
[Khloé] So...

418
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:48,127
I see you online going out every night.
You've been out two nights in a row.

419
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,295
[Joel] Keep your weight here. Last leg.

420
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,798
So who were you with?

421
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,802
I know who...
you were with your little boy... friend.

422
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,672
I mean, I'm not saying that.
Like, a boy that's a friend.

423
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:01,907
Um...

424
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,543
Why is it so hard for you to say?

425
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,413
Do you guys talk about, like,
where you guys stand?

426
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,483
'Cause I feel like you guys go on,
like, these fairy-tale trips together,

427
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,418
and then, do you guys just go back

428
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,455
to your regular
scheduled programs afterwards?

429
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,823
What does that mean?

430
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,724
Oh, my God.

431
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:23,328
Is he your out-of-the-country boyfriend?
Do you guys speak every single day?

432
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,332
This is too much information
to share with my sister.

433
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,370
Really? We normally tell each other
everything but more so her.

434
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,306
She'll call me and talk to me
all the time about all this stuff.

435
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,009
[Khloé] But with this,
she's just [bleep] weird.

436
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,811
Like, get over yourself.
Like, this is crazy.

437
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,213
-[Khloé] So then...
-Khloé.

438
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,718

-[Khloé] Hey.

440
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,699
{\an8}-<i>Hey. What's going on?</i>
-Um... Nothing.

441
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,902
I want to know, have you heard anything
about the surrogate?

442

-<i>No, not yet.</i>
-[Khloé] What?

443
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:11,877
<i>We implanted a few days ago
and we have to wait until, like, ten days.</i>

444
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,178
Well, that's crazy.

00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,480
<i>I know, right?</i>

00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,083
-[sighs]
-<i>It's, like, the craziest waiting game.</i>

-<i>It's so frustrating.</i>
-It is.

448
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,688
<i>This is the time that's the most annoying.</i>

449
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,190
And you just wait it out,
there's nothing you can do?

450
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,093
<i>Yeah, there's nothing you can do,
you just have to wait</i>

451
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,028
<i>until it's, like, far enough along</i>

452
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,464
<i>where we can see if she's pregnant or not.</i>

453
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,133
<i>I mean, it's really nerve-racking</i>

454
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,438
<i>because, you know, it's only
a 60 percent chance that it'll take.</i>

455
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,039
[pensive music]

456
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,941
-[Khloé] That's crazy.
-<i>One didn't work with me.</i>

457
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,543
<i>I tried it and I lost one of them.</i>

458
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,779
Oh, my God, I forgot about that.
That's so scary.

459
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,983
<i>Yeah, so it's hard, like,
it's just a chance.</i>

460
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,651
[Khloé] So scary.

461
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,153
Before Kimberly got pregnant with Saint,

462
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,458
she had an embryo implanted into her
and that embryo did not take.

463
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:04,363
So Kim is super nervous and anxious
during this waiting period.

464
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,834
I mean, of course, she wants to know,
is she or is she not having another baby?

465
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,336
Well, okay,
I don't want to stress you out,

466
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,305
but keep me posted
as soon as you find out.

467
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,775
<i>Okay, I'll call you
as soon as the doctor calls me.</i>

468
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,310
Okay, thank you.

469
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,911
-<i>Okay, love you.</i>
-I love you too.

470
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:20,946
-<i>Bye.</i>
-Bye.

-[Kim] Good.

Look, Kylie bought me this toaster.
She is so sweet.

Obviously, the toaster doesn't compare
to me closing down Saks,

481
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,318
so I feel like the one
who's really shaking in her boots is Kim

482
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,653
because I'm doing a damn good job

483
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,258
of winning my mom's affection and love
and Kim isn't.

484
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,362
I'm so excited.
I really wanted this, you guys.

485
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,064
[Kris squeals]

486
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:17,135
I can't believe how my kids spoil me.
And it's white and it matches the kitchen.

487
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,939
-It's eggshell.
-It goes with your old-school car.

488
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,709
It does. I love when my kids spoil me.

489
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,811
So we have to buy your love?

490
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,779
-No, but this is pretty fun.
-Oh.

491
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,914
Basically.

492
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,851
This is crazy
how much my mom loves this toaster.

493
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,619
Ugh! She is the cutest kid.

494
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,924
I guess I have to step it up.
I'm not gonna surrender.

495
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,395
Out with the old,
in with the new, mamacita.

496
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,164
[Khloé] Doesn't it bother you
that the name is Smeg?

497
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,699
[Kris] I kind of like it.

498
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,470
The only other thing
that would be better is just K-R-I-S.

499
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,571
-[Kris chuckles]
-What?

500
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,240
-What's that supposed...
-Yeah, I could have my own toaster line.

501
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,241
[chuckles]

502
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,510
[upbeat music]

503
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,885
{\an8}[Khloé] Can I vent about Kourtney?

504
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,887
-Yes.
-So it pisses me off

505
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,455
that she won't even say his name.

506
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,391
-I don't get that whole thing.
-[Kim] Yeah.

507
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,693
[Khloé]
I don't get what kind of thing this is.

508
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,660
It's all like...

509
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,831
It blows my mind that she thinks
we're, like, blind or something.

510
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,700
-Yeah.
-And it's hard for me to watch,

511
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:22,901
and I'm like, "Dude."

512
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,836
Hard for you to watch,
like, her, just personality.

513
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,407
Yeah, 'cause I'm just, like...
We're all different and that's fine.

514
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:32,511
We should... Since she won't admit
that that's her boyfriend,

515
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,479
you know what we should do?

516
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,849
We should be like, "Oh, my God,
we have to set you up with this guy,

517
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,217
he's so cool."

518
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,419
We can make up anyone, you know?

519
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,888
[quirky music]

520
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,656
Chris Hemsworth.

521
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:45,757
Who's that?

522
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,459
Thor.

523
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,927
-[Khloé] You don't know who Thor is?
-I don't know who Thor is.

524
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:50,996
Oh, my God.

525
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,999
We are totally testing Kourt,
we do not even know this guy,

526
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,767
by the way, he's probably married,

527
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:59,471
but we're totally just using a hot guy
to, like, bait her.

528
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,543
To see, like... If she won't go with him,
then she definitely has a boyfriend.

529
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,378
-Yeah.
-[line ringing]

530
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,013
-[Kourtney] <i>Hello?</i>
-[Kim] Hey.

531
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,115
{\an8}[Khloé] Heya, Kourt.

532
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:11,917
<i>Hello, governors.</i>

533
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:16,621
[Kim] Oh, my God, we have
the most perfect guy for you.

534
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:17,756
<i>Who?</i>

535
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,660
Okay, he's tall. He has the best body.

536
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:22,961
[Kim] Like, the best body.

537
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,463
-He has blonde hair.
-[Khloé] He has two kids.

538
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:29,367
-He has, like, a 12-pack and big muscles.
-He's ripped. A scruffy beard.

539
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,872
He's, like, a really good actor.
And he's gluten-free.

540
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,611
<i>Where did you find this person?</i>

541
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,746
[Khloé]
Do you know who we're talking about?

542
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,981
<i>Um...</i>

543
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,983
-Thor.
-<i>Thor.</i>

544
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,386
<i>Did you ask Thor
if he wanted to go on a date with me?</i>

545
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,956
[mouthing]

546
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,024
[quirky music]

547
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,160
-Not yet.
-Not yet.

548
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,896
<i>I don't go on dates.</i>

549
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,432
-Why don't you go on dates?
-Why don't you go on dates?

550
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,268
<i>I don't want to sit there
and go, "How old are you?"</i>

551
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,670
Well, I'll go on a group thing.
It'll just be, like,

552
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,139
a chill barbecue at, like, my house.

553
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:15,080
<i>Um, I'm really busy this week,
I have a lot going on.</i>

554
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,481
-But...
-But we noticed

555
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,316
you were out with a certain someone.

556
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,684
[Khloé] So that's your boyfriend?

557
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,753
<i>Um...</i>

558
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,822
[quirky music]

559
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:29,694
So you just hang out with this guy,
but you won't validate anything to us?

560
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,997
That's weird.

561
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:35,233
She fully does not go for it.

562
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,302
-[chuckles]
-So she definitely has a boyfriend.

563
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,104
She's so weird.

564
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,507
<i>This is your best angle, Kim.</i>

565
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,609
Look at that chin.

566
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,613
[Khloé] <i>Ew, why the tongue thing though?</i>

567
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,017
[Kim]
<i>Can't really see with this light. My girl.</i>

568
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,285
[camera shutter clicks]

569
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,987
[laughing hysterically]

570
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,859
{\an8}-[Kylie] Oh, my goodness. Hot tamale.
-[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

571
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,994
It's like 106. I don't get it.

572
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,663
This is, like, not a good outfit.

573
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,931
[Khloé exhales deeply]

574
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,800
You and me both, sister.
[groans]

575
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,338
Hello? Ooh. Air conditioning.

576
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,439
[Kylie] Mm.

577
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,609
-And marble floors.
-[Kylie] Hello?

578
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,244
[Khloé] Keekaleek.

579
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,813
-[Kim] Hi, guys.
-[Kylie] Is this for me?

580
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,349
-Are you hungry?
-[Khloé] Oh, kiss-ass.

581
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,720
-[Kylie] Which one's mine?
-You want the larger one? I don't know...

582
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,723
Do you leave this out to taunt me?
Look at this [bleep].

583
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,491
-It's a blender. She said she wanted it.
-Right, you're a kiss-ass

584
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,827
'cause she said
this is her favorite thing.

585
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,896
You little sneaky snake.

586
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,965
Now you're gonna do a blender.

587
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,700
-You're trying to...
-I just saw it,

588
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,635
and so I was like,
"Fine, I'll just get it."

589
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,403
Oh, when you just see
some diamond earrings,

590
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,072
you should just get them for me too?

591
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,507
Okay. I'll remember that.

592
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,809
[whispers]
Bitch.

593
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,243
-I see what you're doing.
-[Kylie] What is this?

594
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,879
She's buying Mom's affection.
After the toaster you got her,

595
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,048
she's now buying her the matching blender.

596
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,350
What toaster?

597
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,651
[Khloé] The toaster you got her.

598
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,955
That toaster that she's been dying for
and you're like her favorite daughter

599
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,790
'cause you got her that toaster.

600
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,892
[laughs]
I didn't get her a toaster.

601
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,162
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you guys are talking about.

602
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,198
She also said that you took her
to get a massage.

603
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,600
-[Kylie] No. I don't even get massages.
-[tense music]

604
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,137
She's a pathological liar.

605
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,873
-[Kim] Why would she care to lie?
-Why would you lie about that?

606
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,608
I think just to get us
to buy her other stuff.

607
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,477
No, there's no way someone would do that.

608
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,479
-[Khloé] That's, like, crooked...
-[Kylie] She's, like, manipulating

609
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,380
you guys, I think.

610
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:29,714
[Kim] She really is.

611
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,349
She's really a snake.

612
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,020
I feel pissed
that I didn't see this before,

613
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:39,758
like, Kim and I were so consumed
in one-upping each other

614
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,427
that we didn't even see
that my mom is the one that is, like,

615
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,396
manipulating us the entire time.

616
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,531
We should, like, somehow get her back.

617
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,700
Yeah, how dare she lie to us?

618
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:50,902
That's [bleep] up.

619
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,673
[upbeat music]

620
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,813
This is so [bleep] good.

621
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,049
[Khloé] Don't try to eat the other one.

622
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,685
Where is Mom?

623
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,287
Mom!

624
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,455
[Kris] Yup?

625
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,824
Put the sticks both in the other one.

626
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,062
-Yeah?
-[Khloé] How are you?

627
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,297
I'm good. Is that cake?

628
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,599
Mm-hmm. Hold on, it's coming.

629
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,835
We wanted

630
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,737
to truly thank you.

631
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:27,272
For what?

632
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,441
For just being you.

633
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,409
-Aw.
-[Khloé] Yeah.

634
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,944
That's my favorite cake.

635
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,379
I know.

636
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,514
-I love that cake.
-[Kim] Give me a hug.

637
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,885
Okay. What's wrong?
Why do you want to hug me?

638
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,654
Huh? What?

639
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,089
[Kim laughing]

640
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:48,927
What are you doing? Khloé, what is wrong...
What is wrong with you?

641
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:52,497
-What the hell are you doing?
-Read this sweet message.

642
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,635
"How does payback taste? Sweet revenge."
What did I do to...

643
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:00,138
You've been manipulating all of us

644
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,674
and using your daughters
to buy you [bleep]!

645
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,642
-Yes!
-Are you crazy?

646
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,111
Are <i>you</i> crazy?

647
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,913
[Kim] I talked to Kylie
and she did not get you that toaster,

648
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,515
so you fully scammed us.

649
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,419
If that's what it takes for me
to get you guys to be nice to me,

650
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,288
at least I'm smart enough
to figure that out.

651
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,959
[Kim] And you're teaching us
bribing, lying, scamming.

652
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,727
They're life lessons.

653
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:26,131
-Don't ever forget.
-No, now you can buy a mop.

654
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,802
Buy your [bleep] self a Hansen's cake.
You don't even deserve this one.

655
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:34,572
What? Khloé! Oh, my God!

656
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,009
This will show her
not to mess with us again.

657
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,645
Or you're gonna get two cakes
to the face, Kris.

658
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,514
This is bad behavior.

659
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,748
We're big and we're bad.

660
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:45,517
And we're hungry.

661
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,521
[Kim] This is the best part,
if you want a piece.

662
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,122
No. I don't want a piece.

663
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:55,927
I have [bleep] cake up my nostrils.
You guys are both grounded.

664
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,228
You're a scam artist.

665
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:58,696
And we...

666
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:00,832
are satisfied.

667
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,500
-[Kim] This is delish.
-[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

668
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,203
Come give me a hug. Come...

669
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,173
Come give me a hug.

670
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,975
[North] <i>Hi, Snapchat.</i>

671
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:17,482
{\an8}Okay, let me call Khloé
and my mom and Kourtney

672
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,284
real quick.

673
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,187
[Kim] Who should be the lucky one
for me to tell them first?

674
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,190
Kourtney doesn't get very excited
about anything.

675
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,858
Okay, so we'll call Khloé.

676
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,660
Khloé, yeah.

677
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,662
[line ringing]

678
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,264
-[Khloé] <i>Hello?</i>
-[Kim] Hey, what are you doing?

679
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,335
{\an8}<i>Um, about to have Taco Tuesday
with the whole team here.</i>

680
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,638
No way. So fun. So, are you by yourself?

681
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:41,606
<i>I'm by myself.</i>

682
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,874
[Kim] So guess what?

683
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,677
<i>I'm afraid. What?</i>

684
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,548
{\an8}[Kim] So guess what?

685
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,350
<i>I'm afraid. What?</i>

686
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,254
[Kim] What happens every time I say,
"Guess what?"

687
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,689
<i>The person's pregnant.</i>

688
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,524
[Kim] We're having a baby.

689
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,992
[Khloé squeals]

690
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,194
-<i>What kind?</i>
-A girl.

691
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:06,097
<i>Shut up. So you know what it is already?</i>

692
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,600
-Yeah.
-<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

693
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,435
<i>I mean, it's so exciting either way.</i>

694
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,637
<i>I can't believe
you're gonna have three kids.</i>

695
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,940
Telling my family about this news, I mean,

696
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,443
it is that exciting feeling,
like, you're pregnant.

697
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:22,113
It's the exact same feeling,
especially right at the beginning.

698
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,217
{\an8}-<i>Oh, Kim, I'm so happy for you.</i>
-[Kim] Don't cry. Don't cry.

699
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,586
<i>I know, I just...</i>

700
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:32,090
<i>To be able to do that is really great.
I'm really happy for you.</i>

701
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,524
[Kim] It's so crazy, right?

702
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,860
You know, it's really exciting,
but it's also like,

703
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,362
"Oh, my God, this is happening."

704
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:42,600
{\an8}[Kourtney] <i>No way. How exciting.
We're gonna have a baby number seven.</i>

705
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,937
I know, isn't that crazy?
Mom's gonna have, like, 30 grandkids.

706
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,906
-[Stephanie] Oh, my God.
-<i>Are you excited?</i>

707
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,674
[Kim] I'm so excited.

708
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,810
I mean, you know what?
It's kind of weird when it's not you.

709
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,013
<i>Yeah, like, it's just weird.</i>

710
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,550
So I'm like, I don't know whether
to just start eating donuts and celebrate

711
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,755
like I would, like old times,
or just go to the gym.

712
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,990
<i>I think you can do both.</i>

713
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,961
[Kim] Kanye and I were like, "What do
we do? We do nothing for nine months."

714
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,263
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-I'm totally gonna forget, seriously.

715
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,232
And then like a month before,
we're gonna be like,

716
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,501
"Holy [bleep]. We need to get a nursery."

717
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,469
-[Kim] Just kidding.
-[Stephanie laughs]

718
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:19,404
[chuckles]

719
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,040
<i>Do we look like deers?</i>

720
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,675
[Kourtney] <i>Ooh.</i>

721
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,543
<i>You're so cute, Reigny.</i>

722
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,647
{\an8}-[Khloé] Hello.
-[Larsa] Hey, guys.

723
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,050
{\an8}-[Kourtney] Should we sit and eat?
-Are we sharing salads?

724
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,685
{\an8}-[Kourtney] Yours is in the fridge.
-[phone chimes]

725
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,521
[Khloé] Why are you smiling like that?

726
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,525
-Hello, obviously, you're talking to some...
-[chuckles]

727
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,926
Oh, come on.

728
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:43,828
[Khloé] What?

729
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,966
Kourt, you're grinning from ear to ear.

730
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,369
Khloé, you don't get to know
all my secrets.

731
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,206
Kourt's actually getting on
my [bleep] nerve.

732
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:59,911
Just like, the stupid smile, like, smack
the stupid smile off your [bleep] face.

733
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,748
I'm fed up with this whole,
like, silence game.

734
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,485
[Khloé] What were you just doing?

735
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,723
I'm going on a trip.
He's planning everything.

736
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,358
-[Khloé] Okay.
-It's a surprise,

737
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,226
so you're not gonna
get to know the location,

738
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,729
but I have been told what to pack.

739
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:18,997
Well, that will be fun.

740
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:20,999
[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.

741
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,901
Yup.

742
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,170
Why are you giving me a look?

743
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,705
[Khloé] How secretive she is?

744
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:32,310
It's just so frustrating.
Like, we share everything else.

745
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,679
Are you comfortable, like,
talking about him or no?

746
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:38,583
Not really, like, I don't feel like
sitting and like, airing my business.

747
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,386
[Khloé] I am the queen of secrecy as well,

748
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,721
but you won't even say his name.

749
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,189
Like, that's crazy.

750
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,725
Okay, but I'm not using it on the show.
I'm not.

751
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,460
[Khloé] His name? It's all in the press.

752
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,498
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
I don't feel like I need to, like...

753
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,100
expose.

754
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,569
If no one ever knew about something,
that's fine.

755
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,872
But then you're sitting here,
going on these trips,

756
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,574
doing things, it's, like,
people could piece things together.

757
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,878
No one's saying to film your trip,
I'm saying, [bleep], just say the name.

758
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,080
What are we talking about,
this invisible man,

759
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,515
that has, like, some code word?

760
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:13,084
That's so crazy.
Like, how old are you? Three?

761
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,287
It's so weird
that everyone's tiptoeing around it.

762
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,623
Like, okay, the guy Kourtney's dating.

763
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,160
Cool. Younes, Y, whatever the [bleep]
you want to call him.

764
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,228
I don't need to expose
every aspect of my life.

765
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,997
[Khloé]
No one is saying you need to do that.

766
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,266
I'm not saying
to expose your relationship.

767
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,401
-And I don't need to.
-I don't get it.

768
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,869
Stop talking about these trips then.

769
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,172
If you don't want to say
who you're going on the trip with,

770
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,540
then stop being seen with...

771
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,076
It's like, you're living now
two separate lives.

772
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,912
And you're not [bleep] saying the name,
that's so [bleep] stupid.

773
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:44,282
Okay, so say the [bleep] name,
but shut the [bleep] up.

774
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,688
{\an8}You're not [bleep] saying the name,
that's so [bleep] stupid.

775
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,958
Okay, so say the [bleep] name,
but shut the [bleep] up.

776
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,896
[Larsa] I feel like she's doing
what you did in the beginning.

777
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,798
Like, you don't know
where your relationship is,

778
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,733
-so you don't wanna...
-And I get that.

779
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,403
I'm not saying that,
but don't [bleep], it's the name.

780
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,271
-I'm not telling her to tell me...
-You should tell her about the name.

781
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,774
...his dick size, and what the [bleep]
she's doing in the bedroom.

782
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,043
I feel like everybody at this point
knows the dude's name.

783
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,512
Everyone does,
but that's what's so [bleep] weird to me.

784
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,715
Like, get over yourself. It's so strange.

785
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,552
I mean, I don't know, like,
what the balance should be

786
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,588
with, like, showing and not showing

787
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,691
but, like, you can't, like, yell at me

788
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,927
for, like, how I want to handle it
and don't.

789
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,563
[soft music]

790
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,032
Before we started the show

791
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,101
is when,

792
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,937
like, Scott and I
first started being together...

793
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:40,905
[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

794
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,673
I haven't, like,

795
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,209
been dating somebody since.

796
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,246
Like, I haven't had a boyfriend
since that, you know?

797
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,681
-So I'm not gonna, like...
-Do you have a boyfriend now?

798
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:51,782
Sure, Khloé.

799
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,785
-[Kourtney] But I'm not gonna...
-You do?

800
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:57,121
-Yeah.
-So you guys have had, like, the talk?

801
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,724
[Khloé] Like are you guys really official?
Like, you guys... Like, I know that...

802
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,992
-Yes.
-[Larsa] She's definitely

803
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:01,926
in a relationship.

804
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:06,264
I cannot believe Kourt actually says
that she has a boyfriend.

805
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,966
Boyfriend. Kourtney has a boyfriend.

806
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:12,336
I'm just happy she's [bleep]
talking about it.

807
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,873
That's news to me, Kim and Steph.
You've never said this.

808
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,241
[Khloé] And look at you laughing.

809
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,378
Like, you definitely are so awkward
at times.

810
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,847
-[Khloé] I mean...
-No, she's like a teenager right now.

811
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,016
-[Khloé] Yeah.
-It's a teenage phase.

812
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,319
[Larsa laughs]

813
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,590
Oh, my God.

814
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,992
[chill upbeat music]

815
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,569
{\an8}Wait. <i>The Daily Mail</i> posted,
"Kim Kardashian reminisces

816
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,371
as she visits old house
she shared with Kris Humphries."

817
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,140
[Kim] He literally spent one night.

818
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,541
Can I retweet it and be like,

819
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:54,111
"Boo, didn't even have
a toothbrush there, honey. Stop reaching"?

820
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,380
-[Khloé laughs]
-[Kourtney] I'll call you back.

821
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,348
[Khloé] So...

822
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,619
how is everything going
with your surrogate?

823
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,455
Like, I feel like
I don't even know what's happening.

824
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:08,693
I mean, it definitely is,
like, a different process. Like, it is...

825
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,394
I don't even feel like this is real.

826
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,362
[Kim] Same.

827
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:15,766
The fact that this is just what we can do
these days, I'm, like, really thankful.

828
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,703
Like, I'm seriously so grateful for her

829
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:24,375
and that someone is just so, like,
selfless and kind to do this.

830
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,245
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-And I definitely want to keep it private.

831
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,014
Like, I don't want people
to find my surrogate.

832
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,316
Like, I don't want them to harass her.

833
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,819
Like, she doesn't know
how to handle stuff like that.

834
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,288
This isn't her world.

835
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,924
I don't want people following her
and chasing her.

836
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,193
It can be dangerous.
I know how dangerous it was.

837
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,296
I almost got into the craziest
car accident when I was pregnant

838
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:49,433
'cause the paparazzi was chasing me,
so it's just, like, a safety thing.

839
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,470
That's a lot on, like, just her.

840
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:56,807
Like, it's a lot to take on that role,
and just even for you.

841
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,509
Like, do you have peace of mind ever?

842
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,511
-Just, like, it's a lot.
-[Kim] Yeah.

843
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,046
It is frustrating, like...

844
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:07,251
Like, to not be able to do it on your own.

845
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,489
[Kim] It is a weird dynamic.

846
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,190
Like, I go
to all the doctor's appointments

847
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:17,028
and I try to be really present,
but when you're not carrying it yourself,

848
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:21,866
it is such a fine balance of how much
you're gonna be in their lives.

849
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:25,803
Of course I want to know every last detail
that's going on with my baby

850
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,538
and that's super frustrating.

851
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,707
[Kim] But I really trust my surrogate

852
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:33,644
and I don't want to be that person
that's trying to control her every move.

853
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:38,182
It's gonna be a long, hard process,
but I'm gonna take it one day at a time

854
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,352
and hopefully, it just gets easier.

855
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,824
{\an8}[upbeat music]

856
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,698
{\an8}[Khloé] I drank one gallon of water
just in my workout yesterday.

857
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,100
I peed at least 700 times.

858
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,103
-I had three bottles of water today.
-[Kourtney] How much is a gallon?

859
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,838
[Khloé] A gallon is a gallon.

860
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,210
Um, Kourt and I kind of got into a fight
the other day.

861
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,046
-Like, we were at the kitchen table.
-You guys never get into fights.

862
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,748
I know.
We definitely got into an argument.

863
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,817
-We did.
-We did and Larsa was there.

864
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,719
And Larsa was, like, sitting, like...

865
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,722
I was just like,
"What the [bleep] is up your ass?

866
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,858
Like, you won't even say
your boyfriend's name."

867
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:25,463
That lunch with Larsa was the first time
you ever said you had a boyfriend.

868
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,065
-Yeah.
-[Khloé] You just downplay it a lot.

869
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,100
Like, you like to...

870
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,802
I think that's, like, your deflecting,
or, like, downplaying.

871
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,070
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.
-And then

872
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,873
somehow just gets
into this 10-year relationship.

873
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,909
There are some people
that just really casually,

874
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,645
just, like, have new people
in their lives all the time.

875
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,114
Like, that's just not me.

876
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,616
Yeah. So how serious are you and...

877
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:47,985
Y?

878
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,187
[whispers]
Wouldn't you like to know?

879
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,355
Y.

880
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,324
How serious?

881
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,993
What kind of question is that even?

882
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,162
-[Kourtney] Is there a level?
-Do you say, "I love you"?

883
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,930
Khloé...

884
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,633
{\an8}Does he work out with you and Joel?

885
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,902
{\an8}-He is going to.
-[gasps]

886
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,704
-[chuckles]
-[Khloé] Ooh.

887
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,139
That's when you know it's real.

888
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,307
[Khloé and Kourtney chuckle]

889
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,643
{\an8}[Khloé] <i>On the next episode...</i>

890
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,912
{\an8}We need to do a fitness tutorial video.

891
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,614
{\an8}That's hopscotch.

892
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,951
{\an8}You don't really follow through.
I just want you to take it seriously.

893
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,523
{\an8}You guys, so I went
to this media training.

894
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,057
{\an8}I don't want to do media.

895
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:31,162
{\an8}Kris, were there signs that Bruce,
at the time, wanted to become a woman?

896
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,165
{\an8}[Kendall]
It's just [bleep] one thing after another.

897
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,000
{\an8}I'm literally going home.
