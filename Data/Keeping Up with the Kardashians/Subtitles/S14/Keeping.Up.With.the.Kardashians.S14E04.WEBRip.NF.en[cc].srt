167
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,786
What sister are you trying
to morph me into?

168
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,188
It's like you're not like
how Kendall dresses.

169
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,091
No. Kendall's a [bleep] gazelle.

170
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,761
And then you and Kylie are, like,
the sexpots of the world.

171
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,930
[Khloé] I don't dress like that either.

172
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,800
Yeah, that's why
it's gonna be a challenge.

173
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,203
-[Khloé] You think you're so hot.
-No, I don't.

174
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,972
I'm not saying yes.

175
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,241
I just got to get rid of some things.

176
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:32,044
Archive it, put it away. You know?

177
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,914
Oh, my God.

178
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,884
[tranquil music]

179
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,054
I love my look tonight.

180
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,557
My body.

181
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,961
Are you sure you don't want
that leftover lettuce?

182
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,298
-Lettuce?
<i>-Lechuga.</i>

183
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,699
[chuckles]

184
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,067
En español.

185
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,004
How was your night? Good?

186
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,908
I actually woke up to a text
with this link of Scott.

187
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,776
What about it?

188
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,747
Saying that he needs to go to rehab
and that he's in a...

189
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:13,152
downward spiral
and blah-blah-blah and blaming it on me.

190
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,890
It's just, I was, like,
woke up, like, in a panic, you know?

191
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:21,360
Like, just feeling like,
"Am I supposed to stand by his side?"

192
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,729
But, like, what are you supposed to do?

193
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,900
That's just the thing.
He needs to help himself.

194
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:33,039
I think people don't bother me
with any information about Scott,

195
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:37,543
unless it's to the point where they
really think that I need to know.

196
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,512
[Kourtney] And so...
[sighs]

197
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,482
{\an8}I don't know. It's kind of, like,
the same scenario, like, once again.

198
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:48,020
{\an8}Like, I feel helpless,
because I don't always know what to do.

199
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,323
Because it's been so many years of trying.

200
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,759
It's just stressful,
because he is my kids' father.

201
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,029
I just want him to be,
like, healthy and happy.

202
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,535
But, yeah, I don't think I need
to sacrifice my own happiness.

203
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,770
No. Because he's not even trying.

204
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,140
But what if something happens to him?

205
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,980

-[Joe] Good morning, ladies.

207

-We're early, aren't we?
-[Joe] As usual, but I'm okay with that.

There's a black bug right here.

[Khloé scoffs, chuckles]

211
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,263
[Kourtney] Excuse me.

212
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,264
Look at it.

213
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:33,766
[Khloé] Okay.

[Khloé] I believe you.

216
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,806
[Kourtney] Wait, so you know...

217
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:44,176
Did I ever tell you
that I invited Kendall to Santa Barbara?

218
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,411
[Khloé] No.

219
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:50,249
I want you to come, because I feel, like,
what are Kendall and I gonna do alone?

220
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,417
Like...

221
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,319
Is it gonna be awkward?

222
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,820
-Are we not gonna have anything...
-It's your sister!

223
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,555
-No, I know.
-What'd you mean it's gonna be awkward?

224
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,990
And I'm obsessed with her.

225
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,893
But I'm just saying, like,
we don't hang out one-on-one.

226
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,261
I mean, I think it should be you two.

227
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,996
But, like, if you're uncomfortable,
I'll go.

228
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,666
But I think you two should just...

229
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,100
And there's alcohol involved.

230
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,369
-[Khloé] If it gets awkward...
-Some people get in fights.

231
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,839
You... What are you two gonna fight about?

232
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,576
-Sure we could come up with something.
-[Khloé] This isn't <i>Jerry Springer</i>.

233
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,879
You're not gonna,
like, beat up your sister.

234
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:20,813
It's not?

235
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,649
I totally don't mind going
to Santa Barbara with you,

236
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,885
but you cannot use me as your crutch,

237
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,720
-your support system.
-I thought you were there as my crutch.

238
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,890
Yes. I'm your sister. You can lean on me.
But Kendall's your sister, too.

239
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,259
Like, I feel like
this is more in your head.

240
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:37,496
So if I go, you have to still be outgoing
and, like, try to bond with her.

00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,497
You got it.

-Stay like that.
-[Khloé] For what reason?

and my ass gets bigger.

-Hence, why we're wearing camo.
-I understand.

and I always joke that I should style her.

-Or, like, dress her.

so when she gets there, it'll be my bag.

-Right. You just want Khloé to look good.
-And then she has her choice.

totally pack for her everything
that I would use from her closet,

and I'll just send that bag instead.

-And take out her packed bag?
-[Kim] Yeah.

-No. Don't tell her.

-Right. So can you pick one?

-Like, a black one or something?
-I really, honestly,

-can't pick one of these.
-[Jonathan] What about...

00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,943
Okay, okay. Hold on. This is a look.

329
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,911
This, open...

330
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,614
with this.

331
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,083
And just a simple bodysuit.

332
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,052
[Jonathan] That's beautiful,
for a funeral.

333
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,087
-It's pitch black.
-[Kim] We got to...

334
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,789
They don't wear like this
in Santa Barbara.

335
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,358
-'Cause it's a happy city.
-We got to be chic. We got to be chic.

336
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,160
[Jonathan] Okay, let's go.

337
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,828
-Hold on.
-[camera whirs]

338
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,129
Don't rush me.

339
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,332
You're not, like, a real stylist. Come on.

340
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,766
[Kim] Yes, I am, actually.

341
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,536
[upbeat music]

342
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,037
[camera shutter clicking]

343
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,807
[Kim] I think she can wear
the blazer to dinner.

344
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,310
-[Jonathan] All right, let's get packing.
-[Kim] Okay. Hold on.

345
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,913
[Kim] She's not gonna want
to wine taste in all white.

346
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,048
This is taking so long.

347
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,883
Okay. I literally can't take this anymore.

348
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,486
I think she'll really appreciate this.

349
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,789
But, like, wouldn't you be pissed
if someone took your bag

350
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,393
and put whatever their style was
that they want you to have?

351
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,796
Whatever's gonna happen,
I won't be there to have to deal.

352
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,198
[chuckles]

353
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,299
That's funny?

354
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,169
-There you have it.
-[Jonathan] I think we're good.

355

{\an8}[upbeat music]

356
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,609
[Khloé] So, guys, how are you two feeling?

357
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,679
I haven't been to Santa Barbara
in so long.

358
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,648
-When? Like, since Kim's wedding?
-[Kendall] Yeah.

359
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,718
-Honestly, I think so.
-That's amazing.

360
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,720
[phone dinging]

00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,224
[phone whooshing]

362
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,528
So, I feel like this trip,
we should all be very present.

363
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,630
-Okay?
-[Kendall] I'm always down for present.

364
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,731
-I agree.
-I feel like

365
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,767
-I cannot tell you...
-[phone dinging continuously]

366
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,136
-...when the three of us...
-I'm turning my phone down.

367
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,371
-...have gone on a road trip.
-We never have.

368
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,974
-If we ever have. Right.
-Why would we have?

369
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,044
Okay. With that attitude,
you're not getting anywhere.

370
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:30,682
-But I'm saying, why would we have?
-Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

371
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,287
So this is what I would love to suggest.

372
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,824
Let's just enjoy. Let's have a nice time.

373
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,194
-Let's try to be as present as possible.
-[Kourtney] Yes!

374
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,230
Is the weather supposed to be nice?

375
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,766
Yeah, but it's always cool
in Santa Barbara,

376
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,101
'cause it's by the water.

377
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,071
Who's this girl with Scott?

378
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,175
I don't know who she is,
but she's not really concerning to me.

379
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,012
I'm actually just concerned, though,
about, like, his health.

380
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,614
Uh, why? What's happening?

381
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,951
I just, like, keep hearing
that he's, like, out of control.

382
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,619
And people have called me, like,

383
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:12,224
"He's not gonna make it to his birthday
if he keeps going like this."

384
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:17,162
Last week, I was out interviewing people
for our tenth anniversary special,

385
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:22,868
so I was in full prosthetics
and I got a phone call from a good friend.

386
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,971
{\an8}[friend] <i>Hi, Kourt.
Scott just told me to get out.</i>

387
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,040
<i>I told him I can't go, and he said,</i>

388
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,975
<i>"You're the only one
that's always there for me."</i>

389
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,443
Yeah.

390
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,981
I feel like he feels like I give him
more attention when he's [bleep] up.

391
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,984
So I'm just, like, not gonna call him.

392
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,122
[Kourtney] I'm trying to break
the cycle of always being there.

393
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:48,393
I just feel like I need to change it up
and see if that makes any difference.

Whoa. You think I'm a bad driver?

396
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,433
Are you... This is me?

397
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,136

What do you want me to do?

-Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.

-Hi. How are you?

You guys, I have a really big suitcase.

00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,681
[Khloé] No, I don't think this is mine.

Did you know about this?

-No.

and Kim fully repacked a bag

for Khloé with their own outfits
that they want her to wear.

-Wait, what?
-I was like, whose suit...

433
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,464
That's why I was like,
"Whose suitcase is this?"

434
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,801
I don't know if I'm necessarily annoyed
that Kim and Jonathan did this,

about how you have terrible outfits.

-Apparently, you guys do.
-No, we don't.

-This is for wine tasting."
-[Khloé] Yes, I'm just...

I picked stuff all from your closet.</i>

454

'cause it's already been tailored.</i>

to be so simple.

-Thank you. Bye.

<i>Oh, mi amor.</i> I love it so much.

I love Kim, and I appreciate her
wanting to, like, style me,

465
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,755
but, like, styling means you're going to,
like, get me a new style.

466
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,525
[Khloé] She just went in my closet
and, like, put it together... This is hard?

467
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,227
[Kourtney] Yeah, but you wouldn't
have brought that here, I will say.

468
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,495
No, I wouldn't have brought this here.

469
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,831
You would have worn
workout clothes, and you...

470
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:17,035
Half the clothes in your closet,
you never, ever wear.

471
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,672

the... the dope clothes in your closet.

-Work.
-Work. Work.

-Can we leave now?
-[Khloé] You guys ready for din?

You look very cute, Kendall.

476

[Khloé] Do you think Kim
is really buying me clothes?

477
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,157
-Maybe.
-[Khloé] I wish.

478
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,626
If that's the case, I would've let Kim
style me a long time ago

479
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,261
if she was buying me clothes.

480
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,130
But Kim is kind of, like, a hater,

481
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,433
so, like, I don't know
if she's really styling me to look good

482
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,001
unless it's out of my own clothes.

483
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:54,072
-[Khloé] Do you know what I mean?
-She wants you to step up her level,

484
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,341
-but then she doesn't want you...
-[Kendall] Kourt's been on...

485
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,843
-[Khloé] Kourt is on...

00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,978
Did you, like, take something?

487

-No.
-[overlapping chatter]

she's definitely got something.

00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,253
-[Kendall] There's a bug.
-[Khloé] Okay, keep walking, kids.

490
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,823
[Kourtney] I just had a vision
of me tumbling down all the stairs.

491
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,960
[laughing]
Wait. Wait for me. Wait, wait.

492
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,429
-[Khloé] What did they give Kourtney?
-[Kendall] Seriously.

493
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:21,366
Okay, I'll be the one,
since you guys are not feeling my vibe.

494
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,303
I'm gonna ask if they have any
gluten-free bread, 'cause I'm starving.

495
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,939
Like, you can't cheat
every once in a while?

496

-[Kourtney] No, I do.
-Oh.

00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,777
-[server] Hi. Welcome to Angel Oak.
-Hi.

498
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,447
I'm gonna get the gnocchi,
but is it possible to just do no lobster?

499
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,649
-Sure, I'll see what we can figure out.
-[Kendall] Thank you.

500
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,885
[Khloé] And, then,
can I get your lettuce wedge?

501
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,020
And then, I'll have the mac and cheese,
as well.

502
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,055
-[Khloé] Okay, thanks.

508
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,172
Kourt seems really distracted at dinner,

509
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,909
and I can tell that everything going on
with Scott is really affecting her.

510
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:08,180
But Kourt, Kendall and I are here
in Santa Barbara for one night to bond,

511
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,916
but I feel like Kourt kind of has
to just put her foot down

512
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,553
and put her phone down and say, you know,
this is gonna be her family time.

513
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,621
[tense music]

514
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,859
Let me tell you,
we are a wild group of girls.

[phone keys clacking]

516

[Kendall] I'm realizing
that Kourtney's on her phone a lot.

517
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,567
But I'm definitely pretty sensitive
towards the fact that

518
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,336
anyone would be dealing with something
with a relationship or whatever,

519
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,371
'cause I've definitely had my moments.

520
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,506
So I can kind of understand.

{\an8}[Khloé] So what's going on
with everything?

524
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,989
With, like, Scott.
I keep seeing all these things online.

525
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,693
I mean, we're not talking,
which normally we talk.

526
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,562
Like, he said himself, when he's bad,

527
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,264
that's when you pay him
the most attention.

528
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,565
-Mm-hmm.
-So I think a lot of it,

529
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,300
he does to get attention from you.

530
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:06,071
Right and I just haven't been writing him,
because I'm trying to, like...

531
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,207
-Set a different pattern and you should.
-Yeah, the pattern.

532
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,477
This cycle is not beneficial to anybody,

533
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,379
-but especially, and I don't even know...
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

534
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,114
-[Khloé] Listen. I'm not the parent.
-No.

535
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,183
I don't want the kids
to see him like this.

536
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,418
[tense music]

537
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,153
We've been in the same pattern,

538
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,790
even though we're not together
for ten years, plus.

539
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:30,595
And if there was something
I could do to help Scott, you know,

540
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:34,866
help his situation or his addiction,
I would do it in a heartbeat.

541
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:40,138
But I've learned that it's beyond
my control and I've accepted that.

542
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,806
Like, there's consequences

543
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,075
and they need
to be accountable and responsible.

544
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:48,613
'Cause they do affect you
at the end of the day, and your kids.

545
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,416
[Khloé] I mean, it's tough love.

don't think it has to do with her anymore.</i>

556
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,987

557
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,857
she's gonna always be involved with him,
'cause he's, like, the father of her kids.

to enjoy, like, a weekend with Kendall.

I totally get that. Terrible.

I just feel like we're always here
to, like, support you,

but I don't think,
like, everyone has to call her.

and be, like, "Okay, he's fine."

651
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:47,946
She's just gonna think
she went to the bathroom in her pants.

652
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,948
[wheezing laughter]

653
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,418
She's gonna think she was so drunk.

654
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,453
-Let me tell you, Twitter is really...
-We ask...

655
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,022
It's a great tool.
It's almost better than Google,

656
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,727
because they give you,
like, in real time responses.

657
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,362
And they're really crafty.

658
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,098
-[Khloé] It's just a little.
-She'll just have a little [bleep] stain.

659
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,900
[Khloé] A little shart.
[laughs]

660
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,736
At the sleepover, whoever...
Yeah, whoever falls asleep...

661
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,973
-You're [bleep].
-...you're asking for it.

662
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,974
[laughs]

663
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,909
[tense music]

664
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,279
[Khloé whispers]
Oh, shh, shh.

665
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,680
{\an8}She rolled over.

666
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,582
{\an8}She's on her back.

667
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:34,826
[Kendrall mumbling]

668
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,196
-What? What's on my face?
-[Kourtney and Khloé laughing]

669
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,697
[Kendall] What?

670
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,633
[laughter continues]

671
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,069
-[Khloé] What's on you?
-[Kendall] What is it?

672
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,105
[Khloé] We wanted you to shart yourself.

673
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,406
[Kourtney and Khloé laughing]

674
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,141
Did you look it up or something?

675
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,811
[Khloé] We tweeted, "What can we do
to a sleeping person?" And everyone...

676
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:57,382
[Kourtney] Everyone said
to put chocolate in their butt crack.

677
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,518
[Khloé] We wanted to see if you
would tell us...

678
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,721
-[laughter]
-...if you [bleep] yourself.

679
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:06,591
[Khloé and Kourtney laughing]

680
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:11,362
-[Kendall] You guys are, like, 12.
-[Khloé] If only you knew.

681
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,497
[laughing continues]

682
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,165
-[Khloé] Let's let her sleep.
-Okay.

683
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,267
Kendall, you're safe.

684
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,403
[Khloé] What do you want to say
to the camera

685
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:22,206
-before I sign off?
-"Me and Khloé... up to no good."

686
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,643
[upbeat music]

687
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,512
Hey, Kendall.

688
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,851
[Kendall] Okay, let's go, guys.

689
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,053
Hi. Welcome.

690
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:36,487
Hi.

691
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,024
[sommelier] We'll commence
with a Firestone cab... Whoa.

692
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:43,027
Have you do the honors.
There we go. For you.

693
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:46,798
-Still processing what just happened.
-Khloé, I've never seen you ever, ever...

694
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,232
-What?
-...wear a blazer.

695
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,601
[Khloé] Kimberly decided to give me.
Thank you.

696
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,171
You actually look really cute.

697
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,273
[Kourtney] This is a cute
wine tasting outfit.

698
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,942
Yeah, but... Which is fine.
I mean, she had heels, I think.

699
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,446
But it's crazy,
the extent that she goes to...

700
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,114
-style me.
-[sommelier] Are you all right?

701
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,783
Kourt's compliments, she can shove
up her ass, I don't really care.

702
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,920
I look like a [bleep] like,
secretary at a winery.

703
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:09,954
[Khloé] It's just not me.

704
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,589
It's not my jam, this outfit.

705
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:15,493
-[Kourtney] There's one long, black hair...
-Ow!

706
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,894
[laughs]

707
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,196
Hold on, hold on.

708
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,964
No, you're not pulling it
with your finger.

709
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,866
-I have tweezers in the car.
-Let me just see.

710
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:22,767
No.

711
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,371
[Kourtney] All right, let's get on
our bikes and hit the road.

712
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,572
[Kendall] Let's do this.

713
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,841
[upbeat music]

714
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,644
This is so cute.

715
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,516
[Khloé laughs]

716
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,718
-Oh, my God.
-Are you okay?

717
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,387
[Kendall] I just ate [bleep].
[laughs]

718
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,224
-Oh, my God.
-[Khloé] Are you okay?

719
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,861
-[Kendall] I fully, like, skidded...
-Oh, my God. Where?

720
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,095
-Right here.
-Right here?

721
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,064
-Oh, my God.
-How on earth did that happen?

722
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,799
Don't go on those rocks.

723
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:59,537
I don't know if, like,
electric bike riding and alcohol is smart.

724
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,774
I mean, Kendall's fall
definitely made the day.

725
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,976
I mean, it's only good
'cause she didn't get hurt,

726
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,045
but her being so tall
and, like, statuesque

727
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,748
and with this lavender, like, fur jacket.

728
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,986
Like she couldn't have been in a more
obnoxious outfit to fall off the bike in.

729
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,688
-Word.
-Word.

730
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,757
[upbeat music]

731
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,029
Oh, I love these.

732
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,634
So this one's gonna be a little bit more
indicative of a French-style Chardonnay

733
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,369
as opposed to California.

734
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,838
I swear, I've never gotten
this drunk this quickly off of wine.

735
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,239
[Khloé] Are you drunk already?

736
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,176
You guys are drinking all the glasses,
I'm drinking sips.

737
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:42,113
How many glasses
is the three test... tastings together?

738
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,482
-Ten.
-What... No.

739
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,918
-I'm saying how many glasses...
-Ten glasses.

740
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,353
[sommelier 2] There's probably
about two ounces in each glass.

741
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,255
[Kourtney] But how many ounces is that?

742
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,892
-[Khloé] They're not making any sense.
-[Kourtney] I just wanna know.

743
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,796
We tried three testers.
Is that like one glass?

744
00:34:58,863 --> 00:34:59,864
I'm crying.

745
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,799
-I'm so happy Kourtney is on my level.
-[sommelier 2] We're not...

746
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:02,934
Okay.

747
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,871
'Cause I was starting to get scared
with, like, 14 ounces. Whatever.

748
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,041
[shrieks]
Kendall. Oh, my God. Are you okay?

749
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,576
[laughter]

750
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,411
You both are wasted and I'm not.

751
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,946
-Yeah, why aren't you?
-I don't know.

752
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,982
I'm so not on your level,
but I'm willing to take one for the team.

753
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,350
You guys are having the best time

754
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,419
and I love watching you guys
having so much fun.

755
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,653
Okay.

756
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,057
[laughter]

757
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,059
Hold on.
I need to drink the rest of your red wine.

758
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,427
No! Just half, half.

759
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,364
I'll do the rest. So unfair...
Oh, Khloé's is left. No, I...

760
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,532
-Yes, drink it.
-[Kendall] Okay, fine.

761
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,467
What do you think,
you're gonna get a disease?

762
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,237
[laughter]

763
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:44,675
[squeaky, indistinct chatter]

764
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,744
[upbeat music]

765
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,648
I mean, this is the longest
car ride of my [bleep] life,

766
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,350
and why are we at 84 degrees?

767
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,553
-[Kourtney] I'm sweating...
-[Kendall] I have to pee so bad.

768
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,688
...like a sausage. And I have to pee.

769
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,192
-Okay. We keep saying five minutes...
-Here, there's a porta-potty right there.

770
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,660
-Do you want to go?
-Not really.

771
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,062
-[Kourtney] What's that place?
-[Khloé] Thrift store.

772
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,264
Oh, it's... I'll go in.

773
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,667
I want you to know, though, Khlo,
I'm not buying you anything.

774
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,337
Vintage shopping was not my thing.
You guys were my thing.

775
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,039
-But we did it all.
-Yeah.

776
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:19,143
Now, I know you and I call each other, uh,
Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger,

777
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,978
but you and Kendall really are.

778
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,380
[Khloé in Australian accent]
Kourtney and Kendall

779
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,149
in their natural habitat of shopping.

780
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,551
Oh, there they are.

781
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,287
Oh, Kourtney
in the natural habitat of shopping.

782
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,355
[upbeat music]

783
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:36,093
[in natural accent]
You guys were so drunk, but it's so cute.

784
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,230
Oh, good times, Santa Barbara, good times.

785
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,237
Welcome to the spa at Bacara.

786
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,539
-[Kourtney] Are we putting mud on?
-[attendant] Yes.

787
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,542
Once you put it on, you want it on there
for about 20 minutes.

788
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,611
Putting in there like swimwear.

789
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,947
-[Kourtney] What does that even mean?
-I don't even know.

790
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,616
Swimwear, when you walk,
it goes up your butt.

791
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,184
[Kourtney] Yeah, baby.

792
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,519
[laughter]

793
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,521
[Kourtney] Khloé, you're not doing this?

794
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,790
[Kendall] Yeah, what are you doing? Lame.

795
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,959
-[Khloé] You know what?
-[Kourtney] What?

796
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:10,928
I did this intentionally
to let you guys bond.

797
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:14,999
[Khloé] 'Cause you guys now have
to sit for 20 minutes, solo, together.

798
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,467
You guys good?

799
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,202
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

800
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,303
Okay.

801
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,475
Kendall and Kourt have been having
a blast in Santa Barbara,

802
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,044
but I still feel like they have to get
to the root of the problem,

803
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:30,481
and figure out why are they so awkward
around one another?

804
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,253
{\an8}[Kendall] I'm so happy we did this.

805
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,255
{\an8}-I'm, like, enjoying myself.
-You are?

806
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,289
[Kendall] Yeah.

807
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,991
I'm so glad you said that,

808
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,261
because I feel like
I always think you hate me.

809
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,528
Why?
[laughs]

810
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,266
'Cause you go out of town,
and I never talk to you when you're gone.

811
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,035
Like, everyone will be like,
"Oh, I talked to Kendall, I did this..."

812
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,471
But you also, like, takes two to tango.

813
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:56,607
Like, you come to the city,
and like, don't call me,

814
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:57,908
to, like, come and hang out.

815
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,043
-True.
-[Kendall] So...

816
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,178
[Kourtney] Yeah,
I need to just call you more.

817
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:04,382
[Kourtney] There's no reason
why Kendall would hate me.

818
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,119
I just feel like some of it
is just my imagination,

819
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:12,823
but now, we really connected,
and it's strengthened our relationship.

820
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,693
When I'm in town,
you're gonna be my first phone call.

821
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,628
Holding you to that, girl.

822
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,065
I think Kourt and I
have an amazing relationship.

823
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,734
Except for when she doesn't want
to hang out with me.

824
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,069
[Kendall] One time, we were at church.

825
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,038
She came up to me,
she was like, "How are you?"

826
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,506
As if, like, I didn't know you.

827
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,574
And I was like, "Oh, my God,
I have, like, two seats next to me,

828
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,176
why don't you and your friend
come sit with us?"

829
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,211
She goes, "No."

830
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:35,413
[laughs]

831
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,782
It was so awkward.
We have awkward moments together,

832
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:38,883
-but I think it's 'cause...
-Yeah.

833
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,451
-...we love each other too much.
-It is.

834
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,753
-What are you doing this weekend?
-I have no plans.

835
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,089
-Let's hang out.
-[Kourtney] You got it.

836
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,693
What if, like, you stay in it,
like, 21 minutes,

837
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,895
and it doesn't come off anymore?

838
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,030
[Kourtney] Oh, my gosh. I would die.

839
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,499
Got to make sure it's really on my butt.

840
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,803
[Kendall] This is insane.

841
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,471
[inaudible]

842
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,240
[Kourtney] Hi.

843
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,576
[upbeat music]

844
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,211
[Kendall] Okay, I think I'm done.

845
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,513
[upbeat music]

846
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,619
-Are you wearing your bathing suit?
-[Kourtney] No.

847
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,589
-How did you get in?
-[Kourtney] I just snuck in.

848
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,225
Like a slithering snake.

849
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,396
[Kendall] Is Scott going to Cannes?

850
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,530
[Kourtney] I don't know.

851
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:31,469
But I'm not telling him
that I'm going, so that...

852
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,373
-[Kendall] He doesn't, like...
-...book it, yeah, just because.

853
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,808
-Remember last year?
-[Kourtney] Yes.

854
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,111
I remember texting you, being like,
"Yeah, he was all good.

855
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,746
Like, nothing weird, nothing crazy."

856
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,081
-And that night, like, after I left to go...
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

857
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,517
-...all those crazy photos came out.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

858
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,486
[exhales]

859
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,355
[Kourtney] Ken, if it's nice tomorrow,
we should lay out at my pool.

860
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,124
[Kendall] Yeah, I'm down.

861
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:56,260
[upbeat music]

862
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,504
{\an8}[Kim] So how was Santa Barbara?

863
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,240
It was so good, but how funny is this?

864
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:13,411
So we're in our rooms
and, like, I saw this camo bag.

865
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,180
So I was like, "Is this... did...
This is Kim's bag."

866
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,982
That's what I thought. I was like [bleep]!

867
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,384
My assistants must've put
the wrong suitcase in my car.

868
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:23,788
[Khloé] When I opened the bag,
I see a picture of you and Jonathan.

869
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:27,491
And I'm like, "This bitch."
I was like, "These little ass[bleep]."

870
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,562
I'm looking at the Polaroids. And I'm
like, "She thinks I dress like [bleep]."

871
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:35,833
But then it was, no,
also, actually, I needed it,

872
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,036
and you packed me like
a great Céline dress, and this nice stuff,

873
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,772
so I was actually like, "Okay, well, look,
this came in handy. Okay."

874
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,574
It was so cute.

875
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,342
[Khloé] I was very Kim K.

876
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,878
You're welcome to come over
and pack for me anytime.

877
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,880
-[Kim] I'm welcome in your closet?
-[Khloé] Yeah.

878
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:53,818
Because you did such a good job,
I want you to now style me, literally.

879
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,253
[Kim] I love you,
but it's super overwhelming.

880
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,621
Just too much going on.

881
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,661
-Sherlock, I'm hiring you as my stylist.
-I don't have time.

882
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,764
I'm not running around and doing all that.
That's like, those days are over.

883
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,666
So you don't take the position?

884
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,435
No. I don't take the position. I resign.

885
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:12,703
[Khloé laughs]

886
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,472
-I don't understand.
-I resign already.

887
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,574
[Khloé] You've been begging for the job.

888
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,911
I finally say "Let's go,"
and you resign before you even start?

889
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,981
-You always want what you can't have.
-[laughs]

890
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,115
That... that's the moral.

891
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,387
{\an8}[Khloé] I feel like, tit for tat, so now,
I get to style you for dinner one day.

892
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,092
-No. My reputation's on the line.
-Now, if your bags ever get switched...

893
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,427
Mm-hmm.

894
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,098
{\an8}-[Kim] On the next episode...
-Hey, Kourt.

895
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,000
{\an8}-[Younes] <i>Hi.</i>
-Hi, Younes.

896
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,535
{\an8}[Younes] <i>Nice to see you.</i>

897
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,404
{\an8}I haven't seen Kourt
with another guy in like ten years.

898
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,139
{\an8}It's just intense.

899
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:53,477
{\an8}If you're gonna be in Cannes
with, like, another guy, like, have fun.

900
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,346
{\an8}Scott's threatening me now.

901
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,816
{\an8}He's like,
"Your little friend is gonna get beat up."

902
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:02,319
{\an8}It's not a good look for Scott.
This is not gonna end well.

903
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,588
{\an8}[Scott] <i>It got just, like,
way too out of hand.</i>
