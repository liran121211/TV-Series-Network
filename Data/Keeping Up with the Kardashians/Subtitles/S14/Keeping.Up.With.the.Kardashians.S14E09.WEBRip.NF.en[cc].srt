[hair dryer whirring]

3
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:15,482
[Kim] Jonathan will be so happy
that I'm getting my hair back in.

4
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,554
{\an8}I'm getting the long hair put back in.

5
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,758
<i>Thank God. It's gonna be life-changing.</i>

6
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,828
-Life-changing, guys.
-<i>No more MILF.</i>

7
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:30,797
[Mario] MILF.
[laughs]

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,265
All right, I'll see you when you get here.

9
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,566
<i>I'll see you in, like, 30 minutes. Bye.</i>

10
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:34,501
Okay, bye.

00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,903
[upbeat music]

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,777
Oh, my God.

13
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,012
-[Jonathan] Thank you, guys.
-[Mario] Hey.

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,716
Thank you, everyone,
for making it look this amazing.

15
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,018
-She's back.
-I'm back.

16
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,587
[Jonathan] I didn't even recognize you
without your PTA uniform.

17
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:58,258
This is so fantastic.
Don't you feel so much better?

18
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,061
Did it have to go, like, schoolteacher?

19
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,897
-[Jonathan] Could have stayed, like...
-It was cute. The Met was so fab.

20
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,665
Schoolteacher would have been
more layered.

21
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,700
-She did it pretty, like, blunt.
-[Jonathan] Oh, so rabbi's wife.

22
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,303
You know how they wear like the...
Yeah, bro.

23
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,939
We're brutal here
until it's back to perfect.

24
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,842
It's okay. A little, little situation.
We just had a mishap.

25
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,544
[bleep] happens.

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,913
[Kim] <i>Guys, I am back.</i>

27
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,948
<i>Had to get the long hair again.</i>

28
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,684
[theme music]

29
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,975
{\an8}-[Kendall] Hi.
-[Khloé] Are you buying pants, Ken?

30
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,712
{\an8}-Yeah, I want to, but I don't...
-That's the only thing I need help with.

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,948
{\an8}Pick your color, pick your size.

32
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,853
Here. Do you want a large for your ass?
'Cause I like these ones for you.

33
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,155
I don't need a large for my ass,
you [bleep] ass[bleep].

34
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,858
-How big do you think I am?
-You have a big ass.

35
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,427
Just get one pair. Those ones are nice.

36
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:12,132
Oh, my God. This little jacket. Kendall.

37
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,000
-[Kendall] Huh?
-How cute is this little thing?

38
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,969
Oh! Oh, my God.

39
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,972
That is so cute.

40
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,608
[whispers]
This place makes me really happy.

41
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,611
So, I literally, once a week,
have a stalker.

42
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,979
Maybe more, like twice a week.

43
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,082
Someone shows up at my house
every single day.

44
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,217
Not even paps, like let... Like, paps,

45
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,585
-but then also...
-What do they do?

46
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,420
They just, like,
wait outside my house for me,

47
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,556
and my security guards don't let me leave.

48
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,459
They'll be like, "You shouldn't leave
'cause these people are weird."

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,962
My house was robbed
maybe eight months ago,

50
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,932
and I was home
with a couple of my friends.

51
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,668
[Kendall] Every single piece of my jewelry
was stolen.

52
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,104
There were, like, a lot
of sentimental things that I had that...

53
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,439
it sucks you can't get those things back.

54
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,644
I feel like we're so targeted, and people
are now breaking into our homes.

55
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,946
Yeah, I bet it would be smart
to just at least...

56
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,682
Just to be knowledgeable to know
how to protect ourselves.

57
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,950
I agree.

58
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,887
I think in the last year, the conversation
of safety has really changed in my family.

59
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,891
Ever since Kim's situation in Paris,
my robbery, my stalkers,

60
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,494
like, I think
that a lot's been happening to all of us.

61
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,629
[Kendall] It's just... It's a scary world.

62
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,798
What the hell is this?

63
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,934
{\an8}-[clerk] It's an anti-friction powder.
-Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,603
For, like, your private area?
So you don't get...

65
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,272
-[clerk] Like, anti-chafing. Yeah.
-Oh.

66
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,107
[Kendall] That's hilarious.
That makes sense though.

67
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:32,145
I, um, did spinning for the first time,
and the next day,

68
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,314
I was like,
"I swear to God I have an STD."

69
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,582
I was like,
"I've never felt like this before."

70
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,183
And so, the doctor was like,

71
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,485
"What have you done?"
I was like, "Nothing. I don't even know."

72
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,621
"I haven't even had sex."
And he was like...

73
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,257
I said, "I just went to SoulCycle.
Can I get something from there?"

74
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:48,595
He was like, "Honey, you're just bruised.
It's not an STD, you freak."

75
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,197
I was just... I'd never had a bruised puss.
Who knew that could happen?

76
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,467
[upbeat music]

77
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,374
{\an8}-[Kim] Where's the pups?
-[Khloé] Oh, my God, they're here?

78
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,810
{\an8}-I forgot you got the dogs.
-Yeah.

79
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,913
{\an8}[Kris] The little twins?
Which one is that? Is that yours?

80
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,117
{\an8}-[Kim] That's Kourtney's. That's Honey.
-Well, Honey's eating. Sorry, Honey.

81
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,988
-[Kim] I mean, they just don't...
-Oh, my God!

82
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:15,955
[Kris] It's like a child.

83
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,658
-[Khloé] Hello! Whose is whose?
-So cute.

84
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,059
Or do you not know yet?

85
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,729
[Kim] The littler one is Kourt's.

86
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,763
[Khloé] Oh, my goodness!

87
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,499
She's, like, six weeks old
or seven weeks old,

88
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,935
and then mine is, like, 12 weeks old.

89
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,504
[Khloé] I can't handle this.
North probably...

90
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,573
[Kris] Do you have to brush it
every single day?

91
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,074
No, I haven't brushed it once.

92
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,044
How are the kids with them?
These are so cute!

93
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,445
-[Khloé] Why are you...
-[Sushi barking]

94
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,780
-Oh, my goodness.
-[Kris] Hey.

95
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,415
[Khloé] Oh, you're...
you're a little barker.

96
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,686
[Kim] I finally decided to cave
and get North a dog.

97
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,122
And I just think that, you know,
if I'm gonna do it for North,

98
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,057
Kourtney should do it for Penelope.

99
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,294
So we give Penelope and North
their dogs together

100
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,897
on North's birthday,
and it was the cutest thing ever.

101
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,167
[Kim] It was so priceless
seeing the look on their face

102
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,803
and how excited they were
to get these dogs.

103
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,939
So it just makes everything,
like, so worth it.

104
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,875
[Kris] What did the girls do
when they saw them?

105
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,611
North was like, "Mom, can I keep her?"

106
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,348
And I go, "Yeah, it's your birthday.
It's a doggy for you."

107
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,450
-So, every night, she sleeps with the dog.
-[Sushi barking]

108
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,519
Kim, yours really makes a lot of noise.

109
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,154
[Kim] Like, this is the color I wanted.

110
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,656
I always kept showing her pictures
going, I need... I want this,

111
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,526
like, brown color, and I wanted it
to look like a little bear.

112
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,594
But when we got them, mine was sick,

113
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,064
so mine slept the entire time
and was so chill.

114
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,167
Everyone's like, "The smaller one's
way more rambunctious."

115
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,602
And I was like,
"Oh, I need the calm one." You know?

116
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,304
So they tricked you,
is what you're saying.

117
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:42,442
The dogs tricked me,
and now ours will be the barker.

118
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,312
But, like, when you have kids
and they want something so badly,

119
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,082
I just was like,
"I've got to do it for her."

120
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,517
Yeah. That's how you are
when you're a mom.

121
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,721
She loves this dog. Like...

122
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,424
Ah, don't swallow the necklace.
At least you have good taste.

123
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,226
-[barking]
-[Kris] Oh.

124
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,494
[Kim] No. Come on.
[shushes]

125
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,962
Her face is so cute though.

126
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,798
-[Kim] But come on. Come on.
-[barking continues]

127
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,435
[Kim] <i>You look like me
before I lasered off my baby hairs.</i>

128
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,838
[Kris] Hey, Mom.
Come up and see the place.

129
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,974
Come on in to your new house.

130
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,743
Oh, my goodness.

131
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,214
[MJ] Oh, my gosh.

132
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,684
{\an8}-Oh, my goodness, it's gorgeous.
-This is beautiful.

133
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:30,990
{\an8}I'm so excited because I was able
to buy my mom a home this year.

134
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,626
[woman] Is there any more words
than "Oh, my gosh"?

135
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,862
[Kris]
That's the fireplace that you wanted.

136
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,331
I've been trying to convince my mom
to move up here

137
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,968
for as long as I can remember.
It's been decades.

138
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:47,006
And I think I felt like I just needed
to take action and surprise her.

139
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,876
[MJ] "Welcome to your new home.
We love you, Kendall and Kylie."

140
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,778
-[Kris] Aw.
-That's so sweet.

141
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,981
Those are
some really sweet granddaughters.

142
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,016
-[MJ] I have some good ones.
-[woman] They sure are.

143
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,518
-Wow.
-[woman chuckles]

144
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,887
I can't get over those chairs,
how beautiful they are.

145
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,155
And the fireplace.
[gasps]

146
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,524
They said you can make it
be different colors,

147
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,492
and I said, "Oh, no.
We'll take the blue, please."

148
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:11,063
But there's a button you can do
like a reddish for the holidays.

149
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:16,803
I spent a lot of time thinking about
how I would accessorize my mom's place.

150
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,239
And so everything kind of had,
you know, a rhyme and a reason.

151
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:24,410
We could either do, like, a black
or, like, a dark brown.

152
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,880
Yeah, that looks cool.

153
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,119
I just want it to be the perfect place
that she loves.

154
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,755
[Kris] A smooth transition.

155
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,358
The perfect place so she feels at home.

156
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,295
Well, we have to have
a little, um, glass of champagne.

157
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,830
-[MJ] Oh, please.
-[bottle cork pops]

158
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,833
-[screams]
-[laughter]

159
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,938
I... All right, ladies.
Congratulations, Mom, on your new place.

160
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,040
-Thank you so much.
-Cheers to a wonderful life

161
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,176
-in your new house, Mom.
-[MJ] Thank you so much.

162
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,245
I feel like a queen.

163
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,247

164

{\an8}[Sushi barking]

165
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,187
{\an8}[Kim] Did you see that email
for the contour line?

166
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,056
[Stephanie] Yeah.

167
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,092
I'm just reading
that everyone loves the formula.

168
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,594
-Yeah.
-So I feel like that's, like,

169
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,828
the most important thing.

170
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,431
But the majority of people
don't like the sponge end,

171
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,932
-but they like the kabuki end.
-Yeah.

172
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,135
Can we just make a kabuki brush
and take the sponge off?

173
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,136
[Stephanie] Totally.

174
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,539
[barking continues]

175
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,276
[cheeky comical music]

176
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,012
Didn't you have the dog
up in your room though?

177
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,549
I did, but I moved her down here
because she was so noisy,

178
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,384
and at night, I just...

179
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,454
I mean, Kanye is like,
"Dude, what are we gonna do?"

180
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,557
And everyone
that has dogs and puppies is like,

181
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,326
-"You have to just let him bark it out."
-[Stephanie] Yeah.

182
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,862
But it just makes no sense.
Kourtney's does not bark,

183
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,400
does not make a peep.
I'm exhausted from my sleepless nights.

184
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,372
I am being so attentive to Sushi.

185
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,742
I'm, like, going above and beyond
what I ever thought I would do,

186
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,978
and she's just being so yappy, so loud.

187
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:10,616
And Kourtney's dog is quiet as a mouse,
does not make a peep,

188
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,519
literally sits there
like a stuffed animal.

189
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,757
Honey is so cute. Your mom bought me
a dog for my birthday.

190
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,492
[Reign] <i>That's our dog.</i>

191
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,896
[Kim] It's wild how in one day,
they fully tricked me and had

192
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,198
complete opposite personalities.

193
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,200
I just, like, of course, this is my luck.

194
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,237
[Sushi barking]

195
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,371
[Kim] I want to go swap.

196
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,774
Dog swap.

197
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,742
[barking continues]

198
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,178
I mean, they look a lot alike.
But how're you gonna do that?

199
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,715
You're just gonna, like,
swing over there and just steal her dog,

200
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,116
and just put yours in its place?

201
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,751
I don't know.

202
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,822
I mean, if the dogs aren't together,
no one would ever know

203
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,524
which is which. Like, no one knows.

204
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,293
-I can't tell the difference.
-[Kim] No one would ever know.

205
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,896
[pensive music]

206
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,398
What if I brought the other one here,
and then it was so yappy,

207
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,567
-and it was just, like, me?
-Mm.

208
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,603
That would be so sad for me.

209
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,304
[laughs]

210
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,942
[upbeat music]

211
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,881
{\an8}Oh, this baby elephant
fell into this pool,

212
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,817
{\an8}and these two big elephants
went to save it.

213
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,120
[Khloé] Oh, the daddy's, like, running.

214
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,858
-That is so cute.
-[Kendall] Oh, my God. That's so cute.

215
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:26,993
I love animals.

216
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,696
[Khloé hums]

217
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,600
So, have you ever shot a gun before?

218
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,169
No... Oh, yeah, I have.
We went to a range a while ago,

219
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,337
with, like, Scott and stuff.

220
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,239
Do you know what kind of gun you like?

221
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,942
No.

222
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,877
You have to go and hold them
and test them,

223
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,813
{\an8}and see what feels the most comfortable
in your hand, and, like, your grip.

224
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,182
[Khloé] There's a little bit of kickback
to certain guns,

225
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,485
so it just depends
what you're comfortable with.

226
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,420
Hi, guys.

227
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,388
[Khloé] Hey, girl.

228
00:10:55,454 --> 00:11:00,426
What a lively bunch. We all put on
one of these bodysuits and get naked?

229
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,129
We were actually looking up, um...
[chuckles]

230
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:04,764
We were looking up different guns.

231
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,565
I'm just trying to play
with different photos.

232
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,601
-Looking up what?
-Different guns.

233
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,669
[Kim] Why?

234
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,104
'Cause Kendall and I were talking earlier

235
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:16,208
and, um, she just feels,
like, really unsafe.

236
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,211
Like, she says
she has, literally, a different stalker

237
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,614
outside of her house every few days,
and like,

238
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,450
she's a single girl who lives alone,
and she just wants a way...

239
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,253
Like, someone's already broken
into her home, and what if she was there?

240
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,121
Well, that's what you have security for.

241
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,124
But I want to know, like,
about these things,

242
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,195
so I could be knowledgeable of it,
and know how to, either protect myself,

243
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,064
or how to handle a gun.

244
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,233
Not to bring anything up,
but in your situation.

245
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,737
Say that gun,
you were able to get access to it,

246
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,907
-would you know what to do?
-I would not shoot these...

247
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,410
It was three against one,
or, you know, six or seven.

248
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,712
You know, they... I didn't know about...

249
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,946
There's no way
I was gonna get out of there.

250
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,548
I'm not, like, Lara Croft.

251
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,117
{\an8}I couldn't have gotten away
to go get the gun.

252
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,953
I'm saying, if the gun fell or slipped
and you happened to...

253
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,688
I'm just saying, in any circumstance,

254
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,358
don't you just want to know
how to use something?

255
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,395
I'm not comfortable with it.
I wouldn't want my kids around it.

256
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,432
I wouldn't want, like, sleepovers
going on here with the kids here,

257
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,834
and I know there's a gun.

258
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,069
[tense music]

259
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,672
I... I personally don't feel comfortable
with that.

260
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,808
I just... I don't.

261
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,947
I personally am not a fan of owning guns

262
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,181
and having guns in the home,

263
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,418
especially with everything we've learned.

264
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,453
[Lucy] I'm the mother of Jordan Davis,

265
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,222
{\an8}the young man who was shot
and killed in Jacksonville.

266
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,424
{\an8}All over the country, he's deemed
the "loud music" case.

267
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,993
My mom, Dawn, was the principal
that was killed

268
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,762
in the Sandy Hook school shooting.

269
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,831
[woman]
I lost a close friend to gun violence

270
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,767
when, um, I was in high school.

271
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,969
Gun violence is just ravaging
our community.

272
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,872
Owning guns just has never been my thing,

273
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,708
and I think with kids in the house,
I just don't think that,

274
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,676
you know, it's something
that I'm comfortable with.

275
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,015
[upbeat music]

276
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,156
{\an8}[Kris] MJ!

277
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,560
-I have a present for you.
-Oh, I love presents.

278
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,996
-Do you want me to open it for you?
-Well, yeah.

279
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,498
-Okay. It's big and it's heavy.
-Oh, it's so pretty.

280
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,467
-And you're gonna love it.
-What is it?

281
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,236
-Dig in.
-I can't wait.

282
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,472
Oh, my goodness.
[gasps]

283
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,907
Oh, a motor.

284
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,743
No. It's a blender.

285
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,344
A blender?

286
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,814
-Yeah.
-A giant blender.

287
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,518
I bought Mary Jo this gorgeous Mixmaster.

288
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:44,557
Beautiful, stunning, chic.
The prize in every kitchen.

289
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,226
-This is a cool thing.
-In this house, that has no purpose.

290
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,894
[Kris] It makes you look
like a professional chef.

291
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:52,631
Oh, I love your idea of a gift,
but it really should be something that...

292
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,799
[Kris] Okay, look.

293
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:58,237
I think a Mixmaster is kind of
the hero product in every kitchen.

294
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,773
I mean, it's such a great piece.

295
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,644
I'm not sure what's going on.
She doesn't appreciate my vision.

296
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,147
[Kris] It's a little cluttered here.

297
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,515
No, no, no, no, no, no.

298
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,318
-Maybe in front of the plug.
-You can't move my stuff.

299
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,186
-Yes, I can. Look at me.
-No, no. No.

300
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,223
-[Kris] Right there. This'll go there.
-[MJ] Okay. Well, now I need a ladder

301
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,591
-to get that down.
-No, you don't.

302
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,626
You don't need to use a pitcher every day.

303
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,695
-I do, every single day...
-And this can go like that.

304
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,930
-...I use a pitcher.
-This should maybe go...

305
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,465
-Are you listening?
-[Kris] Uh-uh.

306
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,267
-This we really don't need here.
-[MJ gasps]

307
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,835
-No, no, no.
-This can go in the pantry.

308
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,136
No, you can't take that away.

309
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,138
Mom, it's too much crap.

310
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,274
-Put that down there.
-[MJ] This is my tea.

311
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,977
-Put it down there.
-[MJ] No, it has to be here.

312
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,879
What? What do you like about this thing?

313
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,680
[Kris] It's so cool.

314
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,282
-You think that's cool?
-It's iconic.

315
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,418
It's been around since the dawn of time.

316
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,687
-[Kris] Longer than you.
-Bruce Springsteen is iconic.

317
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,222
That's not iconic.

318
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,825
-[MJ laughs]
-Well, that can't sing.

319
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,060

[Sushi barking]

321
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,139
[Kim] Sushi.

322
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,844
Okay, so I was kind of joking
about this whole plan,

323
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,813
but the more I, like,
say it out loud and talk it through,

324
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,982
the more it sounds like a genius idea.

325
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:23,022
{\an8}[Kim] And I'm gonna accidentally get
the wrong dog and see if anyone notices.

326
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,456
[Kim] Kourt?

327

[dogs barking]

328
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,393
[Kourtney] Yeah? I'm in the office.

329
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,963
[Kim] How was our doggy play date?
I came to pick up the dog.

330
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,532
[Kourtney] Good. They're just barking.

331
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,068
-[barking continues]
-That's good.

332
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,069
Yeah.

333
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,473
I'm looking at summer houses
for my travels.

[barking continues]

336
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,248
All right, I have to run to a meeting.
I'm just gonna grab the dog.

337
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,683
[Kourtney] Okay.

338
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:51,650
[Kim] All right.

339
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:53,752
See ya.

She's gonna know if you don't stop.

{\an8}-Hey.
-[Kourtney] Hey.

348
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,052
{\an8}-Want a donut?
-[Scott] Okay.

[barking continues]

350
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,322
[Scott] What is this?

351
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,258
-[Kourtney] Just eat it. Don't break it.
-Ew!

352
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,494
-Is it, like, a dog donut?
-It's soap.

353
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,130
-It's soap.
-[Scott] It's disgusting.

[Sushi barking]

355
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,469
[Kourtney] Why do you bark so much?
Stop it!

356
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,805
[Scott] This dog's a pain in the ass.
Like, I've never seen it act like this.

357
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,475
Mm, I think she peed.

358
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,576
[Scott] Ew.

360
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,815
[Reign] I don't like her.

361

[Kourtney] You don't like Honey?

362
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,252
No. It's North's!

00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,321
[tense comical music]

364
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,022
[Scott] I don't think this is your dog.

365
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,492
Kim just picked up the dog
from a playdate.

366
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,293
Okay, so she took the wrong dog then.

367
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,828
[Kourtney]
Yeah. Our dog does not make that noise.

00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,800
-[Scott] The other dog is darker, no?
-[Kourtney] Yeah, this one looks lighter

370
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,302
-and fluffier and bigger.
-[Scott] A little fluffier and bigger.

371
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,470
[Kourtney]
And ours does not lay like that.

372
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,039
I was gonna say,
the laying is a little weird.

[Sushi barking]

374
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,777
[Kourtney]
These dogs do look very, very similar,

375
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,180
but Reign is noticing
that this is not even our dog.

376
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,583
And I don't care
if Kim's dog never stops barking,

377
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,620
but it is not gonna be staying overnight
at my house.

378
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,922
[Scott] Call Kim and get our dog back.

-She was just here.

There's no way she's not answering.

383
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,865
Yeah, she's probably not answering
'cause she stole a damn dog,

384
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,601
and she's on the run.
You don't just go taking somebody's dog.

-Oh, hello. How are you?

{\an8}-[Kris] Good. You look pretty.
-Welcome to my new nest.

389
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,289
Oh, wow. Look at what you've done
with the place.

390
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,192
-Added a little touch of yellow.
-A little touch of yellow here and there.

391
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,628
-You just have a lot going on.
-[MJ] Yeah, isn't that nice?

392
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,299

It's a little crazy.

393
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,668
-Well, I love it.
-It's just a little cluttered over there.

394
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:26,205
-Oh, yeah.
-But, like, I spend a lot of time

395
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,374
picking things out and putting them
in special places, so...

396
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,944
Mom, where's the blue Mixmaster
I gave you?

398
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,983
Oh, uh, well, it was kind of in the way.

399
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,319
Where's the Mixmaster? I gave that to you.

400
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,521
-[MJ] It's in the bathroom.
-[Kris] Where?

401
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,958
Straight ahead. Just keep going
straight ahead. There it is.

402
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,628
[Kris] Mom, you can't put the Mixmaster
in the bathroom.

403
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:50,863
[MJ chuckles]

404
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,599
-It fits perfect.
-[Kris] This is ridiculous.

405
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,068
-You got to have it out.
-[MJ] Why? I'd rather have flowers.

406
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,270
-'Cause it's so cute.
-[MJ] No, no, no.

407
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,672
-That's an eyesore.
-[Kris] No, it's not.

408
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,674
[laughs]
This is an eyesore.

409
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,645
You didn't want me
to be cluttered, remember?

410
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,649
Well, cluttered
is all that little goofy stuff you have.

411
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,851
-[Kris] Once in a while...
-Like the sugar and a creamer is goofy?

412
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,320
Put it in the cupboard.
There's just a lot of crap there.

413
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,822
No. I use it.

414
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,091
I'm an extremely organized person,

415
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:24,229
and when stuff becomes a little scattered,

416
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,933
I get really anxious. But this is wild.

417
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,472
I feel like the whole feng shui
of this condo is completely tilting,

418
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,874
and I'm not sure what to do about it.

419
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,043
Wait. Did you change to that piece of art?

420
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,545
It's so pretty with the yellow.

421
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,447
I mean, I think with all the blue
and white, we have to have yellow.

422
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,249
[MJ] In fact, I might paint another bunny.

423
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,019
-[Kris] Mom, you didn't paint that bunny.
-[MJ] I could.

424
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,822
Okay, you're gonna try and copy
one of the most famous bunny artists

425
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,692
-in the world?
-No, I copied Van Gogh in the bathroom,

426
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,294
-in the blue room.
-[Kris] Oh, my God.

427
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,764
-So I go famous.
-Okay. Don't mess with MJ.

{\an8}No, I didn't. What are you talking about?

and, like, it's lighter, it's bigger.</i>

<i>It's not Honey. I think you took Honey.</i>

-No, I didn't.

Trust me, I know.</i>

<i>Honey does not make a peep.
This dog won't stop barking.</i>

and he can tell, and he's two.</i>

Ugh! Okay, whatever. I...

444
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,251
I'm not coming back that way,
so can we just swap tomorrow?

445
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,387
<i>No. I will have someone come
and swap the dogs.</i>

446
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,523
You can handle it for one night, it's...
She's fine.

447
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,859
Kourtney figured it out,
like, really fast,

448
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,830
but I'm still hopeful that maybe
Penelope will bond with Sushi,

449
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:09,434
and that she won't want to give her back,
but I don't know if that's gonna happen.

-[Kourtney] <i>So you did this on purpose?</i>
-No, I didn't, honestly.

00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,341
-<i>No, honestly.</i>
-[laughs]

452

-<i>Okay.</i>
-[Kim] Okay.

{\an8}[distant gun firing]

457

It's, like, such a real place.

-[Kendall] Super real.
-[Khloé] Yeah.

-[Kendall] Kendall.

461

{\an8}-Nice to meet you.
-[Khloé] Hi. I'm Khloé.

462
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,068
[Taran] So you guys,
what's your guys' thoughts

463
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,269
on why you want to do this?

464
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,406
[Khloé] We want to learn
how to be comfortable with a gun.

465
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:52,678
Kendall's been robbed before,
and we just want to protect ourselves.

466
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,915
I know Kim is so against us getting guns,

467
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,285
but for Kendall and I, it's something
that we feel like we need to do

468
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,022
in order for us to sleep better at night.
And I think Kim will respect it more

469
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,959
if she sees later how much work
and effort and responsibility

470
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:08,960
we put into this.

471
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,496
[Taran] So, let me show you
some of the main things.

472
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,832
I think it's great that you guys
want to know how to handle this stuff

473
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,034
because, you know,
even if you're totally not into guns,

474
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,103
you hate guns,
you're at some party and someone's,

475
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,139
"I found my dad's gun. Cool, dude."

476
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,875
It's like, "Well, it's empty."
You take the mag out.

477
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:25,477
It's not empty.

478
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:29,614
[Taran] The way these guns work is,
take the mag out, it will fire right now.

479
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,751
So, there could still be one
in the chamber of the gun.

480
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,554
And you can save a life.
A lot of people have been killed

481
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,556
from not knowing
there's still one in the chamber.

482
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,758
So, we get past that part,
I want to show you, like,

483
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,327
the proper grip and stance.
As long as you got as much skin

484
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,329
on the gun as possible,
you're controlling the gun.

if they're going through
the proper channels

636
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,495
and being responsible and owning guns
and how they feel about that.

637

They said they're not...
They're all for the Second Amendment.

They're not against people owning guns.

639
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,302
They also told us
the risks in having a gun.

00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,501
[Khloé] Yeah. And mass shooting
after mass shooting

649
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:07,872
after mass shooting is happening,
and it's so terrifying and so depressing.

650
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,843
And I think the answer
is not to add more guns into the world.

651
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,046
And I know we're only two people,
you and I, but, I mean,

652
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,916
anything makes a difference at this point.

653
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,319
After our phone call with Everytown

654
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,955
and us actually going
to the shooting range

655
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:24,889
and just realizing that,

656
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:29,727
no matter what, no matter how informed
or how much practice we've had,

657
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,796
accidents could happen. They're accidents.

658
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:35,500
And I know that we don't even want
that possibility to be around us.

659
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:40,271
So I would rather avoid all of this
and leave the guns

660
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,673
to our security team.

661
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,076
It's, like, really good
just to be responsible

662
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:49,681
and to know all the risks and, like,
how to protect yourself, for sure.

663
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,884
That's, like, super important.
But it's, I think, really important

664
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,354
to like, leave it up to the professionals.
That's why we have all the security.

665
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,824
It's just really sad
that this is what we have to think about.

666
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,662
[upbeat music]

667
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:10,668
{\an8}[Sushi barking]

668
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,937
{\an8}[Stephanie] Are these the vitamins
you were talking about?

669
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,441
Here, I started a pile for you.
This is Women's Super-Foods.

670
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:20,278
Beauty. Sleep. Flawless Complexion.

671
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,281
-I'm gonna eat the whole bottle.
-These taste like gummy bears.

672
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,650
[Stephanie] You think that they work,
even though they're in gummy form?

673
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,019
-[Kim] I sure hope so.
-[barking continues]

674
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,255
{\an8}What happened here? This is your dog.

675
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,725
[Kim] I know. I took the other one back.
Reign noticed.

676
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,126
Stop. How?
[chuckles]

677
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,962
-Yeah. He's like, "This is Northie's dog."
-[Stephanie] Oh, my God.

678
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,764
-[Sushi barks]
-Oh, stop.

679
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,033
[Stephanie] But it's, like,
the sweetest bark.

680
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,702
Yeah, but you hear it in the morning,
let me tell you.

681
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:49,340
I rolled over at 6:00 a.m. and I was like,
"Someone put the dog out."

682
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,109
[Stephanie laughs]

683
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,810
I don't know what to do.

684
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,380
You know that guy who's the Dog Whisperer?
You should call him.

685
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,116
-Cesar Millan?
-[Stephanie] Yes.

686
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:02,787
Sushi is back with us,
and she is not any quieter.

687
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,623
So I'm gonna have to seek
professional help

688
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,359
because I know
how much Sushi means to North.

689
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,862
There's got to be something he can do.

690
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,164
[Kim] I am desperate at this point.

691
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,866
I mean, I literally kidnapped a dog.

692
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,534
-[Kim] So...
-Yeah, that's really dark.

693
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,670
-[Sushi barks]
-Oh.

694
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,906
-[Kim] <i>Sush.</i>
-[North] <i>Her real name is Diamond.</i>

695
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,675
-[Kim] <i>It is?</i>
-[North] <i>Yeah.</i>

696
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,343
[Kim] <i>I thought it was Sushi.</i>

697
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,714
{\an8}[Kourtney] What are you doing, Mom?

698
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,017
I'm trying to place all these plants
up on the hillside,

699
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,688
because we just started planting them.
If I get you your own shovel,

700
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,690
would you want to come out here
and garden with me?

701
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,326
And I'll get you a hat
that's as cute as this one.

702
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,061
-No.
-Huh? What?

703
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,530
-You don't want to learn how to garden?
-I don't blame you.

704
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:49,467
-[Kris] With Lovey?
-So, I spoke to MJ the other day.

705
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,836
-[Kris] Yeah.
-[Kourtney] I know how it is.

706
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:56,240
Like, we like to get things in order
and make them a certain way.

707
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:00,078
And, like, you decorated her whole place,
and it's amazing what you did.

708
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:04,148
But I feel like you won't even let her,
you know, move,

709
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,784
like, a bowl to the... an inch to the right.

710
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,855
It's just that I wanted to declutter
what she cluttered it with.

711
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,624
And I feel like it would give her
more of a Zen,

712
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,227
-peaceful feeling, and she could relax.
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.

713
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,864
I get dizzy walking in her kitchen,
and it was so pretty.

714
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,566
Mom, you're saying
that it's too cluttered,

715
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,201
but then you're adding clutter.

716
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,670
Like, you just want the things
that you think are cool,

717
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,673
and she wants the things
that she thinks are cool.

718
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,542
She didn't even want the Mixmaster
that I got for her,

719
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,345
which is, like, such a chic staple
in every kitchen.

720
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,082
But it's not about, like, you,
it's her place.

721
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,119
{\an8}[upbeat music]

722

{\an8}-[MJ] Who is it?
-[Kris] Hello.

723
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,767
-[MJ] Well, hello.
-Well, today is your lucky day.

724
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,101
-Why?
-[Kris] Well...

725
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:00,138
-What's happening?
-I came to pick up the Mixmaster.

726
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,239
[MJ] Oh, really?

727
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,709
Yes, I am not gonna torture you
or make you suffer

728
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,513
for one more day, missy.
Kourtney told me that you talked to her.

729
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,580
-Yes.
-[Kris] Yeah.

730
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,984
Listen, I spent a lot of time
decorating this,

731
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,421
and so I think I just got
a little excited and territorial...

732
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,289
-[MJ] Possessive.
-...about it.

733
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,192
-[MJ] I know.
-But you need to make this your home

734
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,328
and feel comfortable and happy,
and have things

735
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,830
-the way that you want them.
-[MJ] That I want it?

736
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,331
-Yeah. It's your home.
-I kind of do.

737
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:32,570
And I get that, so I apologize
for getting a little too excited

738
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,939
-about where you should put your stuff.
-Aw.

739
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:39,777
But I'm gonna take your little friend,
and I'll find a home for her.

740
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,046
Aw. It was such a nice gesture, but...

741
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,816
-[Kris] Yeah.
-I'm just not the baker I used to be.

742
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,019
I really wanted
to make everything perfect,

743
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,421
but Kourtney's probably right.

744
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:56,360
So I'm going to back off
and, as they say, grin and bear it,

745
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:01,132
and just let her have her clutter
wherever she wants it.

746
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,535
If you don't want a little chicness
in your kitchen,

747
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,370
then I will take this chicness
somewhere else.

748
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,872
Well, I got another little tchotchke.

749
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,808
I got this, I thought,
"Kris might not let me have this."

750
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,443
I got this little guy, isn't that cute?

751
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,012
[Kris] All right,
you really are losing control.

752
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,014
-The H word.
-[MJ] The H word?

-[whispers] Hoarder. You're a hoarder.
-Hoarder.

00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,219
Mm. Thought you were gonna say
something else.

{\an8}-This is your Pomeranian?
-This is Sushi.

764

[Cesar] Great name. Hi.

765
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:47,578
Guess who this is. He's the Dog Whisperer.

766
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,949
So guess what we're gonna try
to teach Sushi to do today.

767
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,351
-No.
-Not bark.

768
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,553
[Kim] She bites a lot.

769
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,523
Like, I can't even walk, like,
she just, like, attacks my feet.

770
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,926
And for my sanity,
all I wanted was, like, a really...

771

-Calm dog.
-...calm dog.

772
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,362
I'm sure
that's what everyone wants, right?

773
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,330
Yeah, well, that has to do with structure.

Yeah, I'm gonna show you a little bit,

-just very basic stuff.
-Show us a little bit.

00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,041
I am so excited to meet Cesar.

780
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,010
He obviously knows what he's doing,

781
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,847
and I'm so excited for him
to just meet our dog,

782
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,951
and see, you know,
tricks and tips that we can learn

783
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,819
to really help train Sushi.

784
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,455
I have to show you this.
I'll put on these shoes,

785
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,625
and you'll see what she does to me.
I get it, they're fur.

786
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,928
[Cesar] Mm-hmm. Mm.

787
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,363
[Kim] Like, I literally,
they're my most comfy slippers,

788
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,732
so if I have to get rid of them,
I will, but it's...

789
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:42,833
[Sushi barking, growling]

790
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,002
-[Kim] Okay, come on.
-Oh, that's bad.

791
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,471
{\an8}[Sushi barking]

792
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,440
{\an8}That's... that's too far. Yeah, that's...

793
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,742
-Look, Northie.
-That eventually can be bad.

794
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,010
[Kim] There you go.

795
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,881
[Cesar] You just rewarded it.
Yeah, this is pretty bad.

796
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,517
It's chasing right now, see?
It looks cute in the beginning,

797
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,652
but, eventually, it's painful,
so we have to make sure

798
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,654
that she does this,
or he does the same thing,

799
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:07,558
but to something that is more his own,
like toys, but that's not a toy.

800
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,728
[North] I gave my dog the dog toy, and...

801
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,096
Oh, she likes it.

802
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,364
[growling]

803
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,399
[Cesar] She likes it,
but she's guarding it.

804
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:18,069
So, one thing is retrieving,
meaning they bring it to you.

805
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,871
When they go grab it
and they take it away,

806
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,506
what they're saying, "This is mine."

807
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,309
So if you go get it,
that's when the growl begins.

808
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,812
Yeah, she's not, like,
a "fetch" kind of dog, so...

809
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,447
-[Cesar] You have to trigger that.
-Yeah.

810
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,083
In some breeds, it's natural. Labradors.

811
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,885
In other breeds,
you have to trigger bringing things back.

812
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,320
Can you go get my phone, Sushi?

813
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,090
-Can I kind of teach her that?
-[Cesar chuckles] Kind of.

814
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,524
[Kim laughs]

815
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,393
[Cesar] And then we can work on that.

816
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:46,030
What you have done is,
she's getting a reward for chasing it.

817
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,466
So she's not understanding
to leave the shoe alone.

818
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,702
So before you actually wear them,
teach them to leave them alone.

819
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,770
Shh.

820
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,707
-There.
-Wow, she's not interested.

821
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,776
-You want to try it? Yeah.
-[Kim] Sure.

822
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,612
-[Kim] So...
-[Cesar clicks tongue]

823
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,080
[Cesar] There you go. Shh.

824
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,117
So it's learning now with the... Shh.

825
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,819
With the shoes on. If she's not doing it,
we don't use the sound.

826
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:09,820
Shh.

827
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,189
-Right there.
-Shh!

828
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,527
Don't move away, she has to move. Shh.

829
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:18,996
[Cesar] There you go.

830
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,933
Ooh, that was a good one.

831
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,739
-There you go. You get it?
-Mm-hmm.

832
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,608
What you're gonna see,
by her having more rules

833
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,510
and boundaries, she's gonna calm down.

834
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,779
[Sushi barking]

835
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,415
[Cesar] You need to work on
the proper way to drain energy.

836
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,050
Right now,
the energy is all over the place,

837
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,318
so your house becomes
like Chuck E. Cheese.

838
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,719
I think even just going on walks

839
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,187
-with the kids...
-Oh, totally.

840
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,523
-...would be, like, key.
-Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna put a leash

841
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,058
-so you can see the shift.
-[Kim] Okay.

842
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,859
-[Sushi barking]
-Okay, so right now, this is, uh,

843
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,462
she is going through a very playful state.

844
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:56,100
So watch how a foreign object
changes the state of mind.

845
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,601
Sushi bushi.

846
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,506
All right, so what we're looking for
is... is for her...

847
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:06,811
that once she wears this object,
for the mind to calm down.

848
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:11,816
[Cesar] As soon as she settles, we take
the leash off, and the lesson stops.

849
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,384
{\an8}-[Sushi barks, whimpers]
-Shh.

850
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,155
[Cesar] There you go.
That's what I was looking for.

851
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:21,058
Always release them
when they're in a calm state.

852
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,561
-[Kim] Okay.
-[Cesar] So what did you learn today, Kim?

853
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,764
I definitely learned to be,
like, more... Hey!

854
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,167
-There you go.
-No. More of, like, the authority,

855
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:33,637
instead of just running along with it
and letting her bite it,

856
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,607
and just giving her my shoe.
She's like a kid.

857
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:41,145
You really do have to spend the time,
like, going out on the walks.

858
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,313
[Sushi barks]

859
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,950
It's really exciting to know
that Sushi's, you know,

860
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:49,920
issues are fixable,
and she's just a part of the family now,

861
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,555
so we just... we got to work on it.

862
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,257
{\an8}Dogs can eat chicken.

863
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,059
{\an8}That's one of their favorites.

864
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,795
{\an8}[Kim] You know what she just doesn't eat?
Sushi doesn't eat sushi.

865
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,697
-Isn't that silly?
-[Cesar chuckles]

866
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,798
-[Sushi barks]
-[Kim] Shh!

867
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,501
{\an8}[Kim] <i>On the next episode...</i>

868
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,504
{\an8}Top secret,
my surrogate passed all of her tests.

869
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,539
{\an8}We'll just try one embryo.

870
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,876
{\an8}[Kim] <i>You know, it's only
a 60 percent chance that it'll take.</i>

871
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,611
{\an8}-That's so scary.
-[Kim] <i>Yeah.</i>

872
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,847
{\an8}I see you online going out every night.
Who were you with?

873
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,316
{\an8}[Khloé] She won't even say his name.

874
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,085
{\an8}Like, let's say his name now.

875
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,853
{\an8}She doesn't say anything about it.

876
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,389
{\an8}You're not [bleep] saying the name,
that's so [bleep] stupid.

877
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,992
{\an8}So say the [bleep] name,
but shut the [bleep] up.
