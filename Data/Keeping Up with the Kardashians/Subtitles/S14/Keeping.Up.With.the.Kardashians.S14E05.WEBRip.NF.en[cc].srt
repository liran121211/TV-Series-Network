00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,672
{\an8}Bye, Khlo. Love you.

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,508
{\an8}Kourt has been out
on the dating scene recently.

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,810
{\an8}[Khloé] I know a little bit
about this guy.

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,078
{\an8}Was it nice?

5
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,947
{\an8}-Yeah.
-[Khloé] Good.

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,484
{\an8}I keep seeing all these things online
with Scott.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,519
{\an8}He's said himself, when he's bad,

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,254
{\an8}that's when you pay him
the most attention.

9
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,090
{\an8}So I think a lot of it he does
to get attention from you.

10
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:27,494
{\an8}Right, and I just haven't been writing him
because I'm trying to, like...

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,697
{\an8}-Set a different pattern and you should.
-...switch up the... yeah, the pattern.

12
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:31,798
{\an8}What's the problem?

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,000
{\an8}Everyone's like calling Kourtney,
worried about you.

14
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,169
{\an8}[upbeat music]

15
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,206
{\an8}[Khloé] We're here.

16
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,910
{\an8}Mason, he wanted to know
what the DMV was and look.

17
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,045
{\an8}This is it!

18
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,515
-[Landon] So exciting.
-Is it as exciting as you thought here?

19
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:49,916
[Mason] Yep.

20
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,885
So now, guess what,
I want to take a picture,

21
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,721
'cause when you drive a car,
you need a license.

22
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:55,688
Okay.

23
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,457
[Mason] Can I get a driver's license?

24
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:01,027
[Khloé] No. You need a driver's license
when you're 16.

25
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,164
[Khloé] I finally get to change
my last name back to Kardashian.

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,466
This is much better than,
like, a divorce party.

27
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,934
{\an8}So, Landon, what do you think we do?

28
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,071
{\an8}I think you stay right there.
I'll throw the ring around the lens.

29
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,008
[Malika] Okay, are we ready?
Are we focused here?

30
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,945
-You have to smile.
-Yeah, look like Tyra Banks.

31
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,680
-[Malika] Yes.
-[Khloé] Yeah, got it.

32
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,749
-Okay.
-[Mason] KoKo, look what I can do.

33
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,784
Wait, I'm focused right now,
so I love you. Hold on.

34
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,920
[Malika] We'll talk to you
in five seconds, Mase.

35
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:27,954
[Mason] You're weird.

36
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,757
Oh, my God. You guys are making me laugh.

37
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,325
[Malika] It's a lot of pressure.

38
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,793
[Mason] Let it rip.
[laughing]

39
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,195
[indistinct chatter]

40
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,831
-[Malika] I think that's gonna do it.
-I think that's it, guys.

41
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,899
Did you say, "Let it rip"?

42
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,835
[Malika] Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a good ID.

43
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,136
[Khloé] Yeah! We did it.

44
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,405
-Yeah!
-[whooping]

45
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,339
[Khloé gasps]

46
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,341
Yay! Look, Mase.

47
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,643
-This is my temporary. Thank you.
-[whoops]

48
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,612
-[Landon] You're welcome, bro.
-[Khloé] We did it.

49
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,681
-[Khloé] What do you say to everyone?
-Thank you.

50
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,049
[laughter]

51
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,118
Thank you in his language.

-[Kourtney] Steph.
-[Stephanie] Yeah.

59
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,029
They just said, "Can we add two more
onto the dinner reservation tonight?"

60
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,632
-Oh, my, thank you.
-Guess.

61
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,468
No. I don't want to guess. No!

62
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,270
-Who?
-[Stephanie] I know who it is.

63

-We'll all go together.
-[Kim] Like, who?

64
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,175
You know who. We're going with her friend.

65
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,677
I really didn't like Stephanie for years.

66
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,879
Like, did not. It was so crazy.

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,183
And then I don't know. Was it...

68
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,717
-We started traveling.
-I think it just...

69
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,853
[Kim] She was single, you were single.

70
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,188
And, like, you just loved to hang out

71
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,323
and have a partner-in-crime
to go out with.

72
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,492
[Kourtney] It's more like
she'll borrow clothes,

73
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,594
and we'll talk on the phone and work out.

74
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,131
I kind of, like, looked up
and they were BFF or wifies.

75
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,899
We're gonna Snapchat.

76

[Stephanie laughs]

77
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,572
Kourt, do you remember these boots?
I was obsessed with them in, like, 1999.

78
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,876
All I would do in 1999, you guys,
is watch <i>Forensic Files</i>

79
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,213
and scare the [bleep] out of myself
and lock myself upstairs,

80
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,281
and order on eBay all day long.

00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,973

You want nothing?
Okay. I'll order you nothing.

00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,112

I love that thing.

-[background chatter]
-Um...

92
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,618
Scott was photographed last night
with Bella.

93
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,420
-[Kendall] Uh-huh. I saw.
-Oh, you saw?

94
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,689
And then he's been writing me all morning.

95
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:21,728
He's like, "I sold my house
and I think that I should move in."

96
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,229
He wants to move in with you?

97
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,633
-Yeah. "I think that I should move in."
-What?

98
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,168
He's like, "Then we could just raise
the kids together,

99
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,172
and have, like, an open relationship."
Like, it's insane.

100
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,743
[Kourtney] Scott and I are not
in a good place.

101
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:42,348
{\an8}He's been partying and I've been trying
to just, like, distance myself.

102
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,251
So I'm, like, is he serious that he thinks

103
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,821
that there's any sort of chance
of moving back into the house?

104
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,423
Because that's just wild.

105
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,459
-Wait, he said you could have an open...
-[Kourtney] Relationship.

106
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:58,364
And I'm like, could you imagine
if I went out one night and slept out,

107
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,835
like, what would the debauchery
that would go down?

108
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,605
[Kourtney] He doesn't know
that I'm going to Cannes.

109
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,309
I'm going to Cannes
for the Cannes Film Festival.

110
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,946
Kendall is going to be staying with me
on my friend's boat.

111
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:18,851
I'm really excited,
but I'd rather Scott not know

112
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,888
so that he doesn't come
just because I'm there.

113
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,725
-I want to see it. This is this morning?
-Yeah.

114
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,363
-[Kendall] Wait, what?
-"Crazy I marry you and you say no,

115
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,032
but I still don't give up."
He means crazy I asked...

116
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,434
-Proposed.
-...to marry, yeah.

117
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,302
Is he writing you now?

118
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,670
-No, no, she's looking.
-Yeah. He's texting me,

119
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,205
-telling me he wants to marry me.
-Yeah.

120
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,774
Weirdest family ever.

121
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,009

[upbeat music]

123
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,153
{\an8}There's a picture of me
with very long hair,

124
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,455
and I want to caption it and just say,

125
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,024
"Should I be original
and say 'long hair, don't care'?"

126
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:58,925
[Kourtney] No.

127
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,961
"Long hair don't care,
dot, dot, dot, original."

128
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,331
-Mm-mm.
-Well, I already wrote one of those.

129
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,265
Okay.

130
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,772
Um, so what is all of this,
like, Planned Parenthood talk,

131
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,175
where everyone's, like, wanting to, like,
protest for Planned Parenthood?

132
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:20,613
You know, I don't watch TV.
I don't look online really.

133
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,584
There's been a lot of controversy
over Planned Parenthood lately,

134
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,720
because they're trying to take away
the government funding.

135
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,157
'Cause some people are pro-choice
and some are pro-life.

136
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,193
-So people are going wild?
-Yeah.

137
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,398
I want to have an opinion about this,
but I just don't know enough.

138
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,867
There's nothing worse than, like,
wanting to, like, support people,

139
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,835
-and then, but not know anything.
-Or speak up on a cause.

140
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,770
[both] Yeah.

141
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,606
'Cause I do like to speak up
on social media about topics

142
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,443
that mean something to me
and I want to be more informed.

143
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,578
Let's call Khloé.

144
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,514

145
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,482
{\an8}-[Khloé] <i>Hello.</i>
-[Kim] Hi.

146
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,186
{\an8}-<i>Hi.</i>
-Are you pro-choice or pro-life?

147
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,358
<i>I'm pro-choice, but that doesn't mean
I'm, like, for abortion,</i>

148
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,562
<i>but I think there's certain circumstances
where people should be given the choice.</i>

149
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,265
-Totally.
-<i>Where is this coming from?</i>

150
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,935
-<i>Do you need to tell me something?</i>
-[Kim] No. I was just curious.

151
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:20,506
The government is now not going
to fund Planned Parenthood anymore.

152
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,809
<i>I think it's a really big misconception.</i>

153
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,112
<i>I think people think Planned Parenthood
is an abortion center.</i>

154
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,749
[Kim] I think that we should go there
and educate ourselves.

155
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:33,453
-Yeah.
-So I can have a stance on it.

156
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,822
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-All right, cool. We'll call you back.

157
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,024
-<i>Okay.</i>
-Bye.

-Kanye had a dog growing up named Genius.
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.

159
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,433

she's like...

"Ruff, ruff. My name is Genius."

162
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,406
[in normal voice]
And she just, like, goes around.

163
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,309
[Kim] That's my cute doggy. Look.

164
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,910
Ruff, ruff!

165
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,979
[upbeat music]

166
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,652
{\an8}-You know Mom copies all of my cookies?
-[Kourtney] <i>Yeah.</i>

167
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,755
{\an8}And now I'm sitting here and there's
a bowl full of baby watermelons,

168
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:14,327
like I have at my house. Like, can...
Is there no originality ever from anybody?

169
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,295
<i>There's not, but that's okay.</i>

170
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:20,833
<i>She does give us a lot of our ideas
that we have our whole life.</i>

171
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,470
Ooh! That positive twist,
I respect it. Thank you.

172
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,673
<i>So, you know what,
Scott said he's going to Cannes.</i>

173
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,876
Oh, my God.

174
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:33,346
<i>I truly didn't know that he was going.</i>

175
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,515
<i>He was writing Kendall,
"Are you going to Cannes?"</i>

176
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,683
<i>Then he started writing me,
"Are you going to Cannes?"</i>

177
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,154
-And he wrote Kim too.
-<i>Yeah. So I'm sure he assumes...</i>

178
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,257
-He definitely assumes you're going.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

179
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:49,195
<i>And then he said, "I don't want, like,
a Daily Mail situation there."</i>

180
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,965
<i>Like, I'm the only one
who's somewhat incognito,</i>

181
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,134
<i>like, as much as I can be.</i>

182
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,205
Yeah. It's just selfish, 'cause he doesn't
care how he embarrasses you.

183
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,974
[Khloé] He's running around town
with Bella and all these other people.

184
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,511
<i>Exactly. All right,
I'm gonna write him back now.</i>

185
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,080
I would just say, "Listen, I am gonna go.

186
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,483
And if it's hard for you
or awkward for you,

187
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,253
then, you know, I would..."
Like, "I leave this date You should come..."

188
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,489
He doesn't need... When's his appearance?

189
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,625
<i>I mean, who knows
if he even has an appearance?</i>

190
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,993
Right.

191
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,797
It is crazy that, you know,
Scott won't leave Kourt alone.

192
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,033
We just went through all that [bleep]
in Santa Barbara

193
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,602
and then, all of a sudden,
now Scott is going to Cannes.

194
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,938
Like, it's just super suspicious.

195
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,841
[upbeat music]

196
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,579
{\an8}[Khloé] Hello!

197
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,348
Excuse me, Gabbs.

198
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,017
[Kourtney chuckles]

199
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,752
[Khloé] How was your morning?

200
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,455
You know, one thing after another.

201
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:54,060
I got up at seven, took Mase to school,
went to the dermatologist,

202
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,396
and then, when Scott found out
that I'm going to Cannes,

203
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,066
we got into, like, a full war.

204
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,801
-After you told him that?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

205
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,737
He's like, "Oh, well,
I tried to give you a chance."

206
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,107
I'm like, "A chance for what, to not go?"

207
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,209
He's like,
"You're gonna have a great time."

208
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,811
And then he's threatening me now.

209
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,248
He's like, "Your little friend is gonna
get beat up every single day

210
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,216
when we're there."

211
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,953
He goes, "Enjoy yourself. Walking around,
you better watch your back."

212
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,623
And I'm like, "Oh, are you gonna have
people attack me?"

213
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,259
He's like, "You're the love of my life.
Why would I have anyone attack you?"

214
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,595
I'm like, "Hold on, I'm so confused."

215
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,897
-[Khloé] This over the phone or in text?
-[Kourtney] Both.

216
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,733
-[Kim] Hi, guys.
-Hi.

217
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,269
[Kourtney] And he's like, "Just don't
expect anywhere you go will be easy now."

218
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,040
And I said, "I will never speak
to you again with your threats,

219
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,174
you psychopath."

220
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,275
Yeah.

221
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,378
"If you threaten me and my friends,
it's over.

222
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:50,116
That's not how I will be treated.
You've treated me horribly for years."

223
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,752
And he's like, "I'm sorry.
Anyone who gets in the middle

224
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,021
will not be pleased with the outcome."

225
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,089
[suspenseful music]

226
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,158
-[Kim] He's crazy.
-[Kourtney] You know how he is.

227
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:03,496
-And when he's not in a rational place...
-He's dark and twisted.

228
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,797
[Kourtney] Yeah.

229
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,067
I just can't believe that he would stoop
this low and speak to her like this.

230
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,736
Like, at the end of the day,
she's still the mother of his children.

231
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:15,708
So to say that he's gonna have people
get beat up, like, that's disgusting.

232
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,778
So I really hope
he was out of his right mind.

233
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,279
Or just, like, angrily talking,

234
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,415
thinking he's gonna scare her
but he would do nothing.

235
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,051
-Yeah. It's just so childish.
-Just to like... Yeah.

236
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,453
Do you want me to call him and say,
"What is wrong with you?"

237
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,888
Yeah, sure. I say you call him.

238
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,956
[Khloé] Don't you ever speak
to my sister like that.

239
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,224
[line ringing]

240
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,528
He's not gonna answer.

241
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,830
[phone operator] <i>I'm sorry,
but the person you called...</i>

242
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,398
I'm gonna call back.

243
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,101
[line ringing]

244
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,437
[suspenseful music]

245
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,972
-[phone operator] <i>I'm sorry, but the p...</i>
-[Khloé exclaims]

246
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,908
He so is avoiding you.

247
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,977
Like, when Scott does something
and he knows it, he avoids you.

248
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,547
-[Khloé] Yeah.
-He avoids all of us. It's so funny.

249
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,682
-It's so obvious too.
-So obvious.

250
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,451
-Like, he's not even good at it.
-Yeah.

251
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,220
[phone operator] <i>I'm sorry,
but the person you called...</i>

252
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,455
[Khloé] I'll keep calling.

253
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,623
You think I have shame in my game?

254
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,625
[line ringing]

255
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,295
[upbeat music]

256
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,938
You know, when Kourtney was telling me
that she was going,

257
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,407
she was kind of being
a drop condescending.

258
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:26,846
And I think I got defensive
and just said, like, "Okay, great, like,

259
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:33,085
if you're gonna be in Cannes with, like,
another guy, like, have fun, but...

260
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:38,290
just know that
it's probably not gonna be that fun

261
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,426
if, like, you run into me and my friends."

262
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,263
But the fact of the matter is
she's allowed to live her life.

263
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,000
She's a single girl and, obviously,
we all know that I do what I want,

264
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,002
so she should be able to do
what she wants.

265
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,738
It's just there's a lot of anger.

266
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:56,542
Like, "Wow, it's really real,
us not being together."

267
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,880
[upbeat music]

268
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,915
[laughter]

269
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,351
{\an8}We're just cruising in the garage, guys.

270
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,089
{\an8}I'm not sure where the security
put my bag.

271
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,657
[Kim] Oh, it's downstairs.

272
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,261
He's kind of weird. He like stood outside
the car, and then I was like, "Hi."

273
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,963
I just have to tell him, like,
obviously, my sisters are always fine.

274
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,666
No, he was like, "Oh, okay, I was just
making sure who it was."

275
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,767
So that's fine.

276
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,271
I'd rather safe than sorry
if he didn't know who I was, pulling up.

277
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:29,041
Yeah. How was last night?
I heard you went out with Steph.

278
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,678
It was fun. We had a good, fun night.

279
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,482
But, just a heads-up, we were talking,

280
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,820
and she was just saying that she didn't
know what she wanted to do in life

281
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,656
and, like,
she feels like maybe she's in a place

282
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,892
-where, like, she's unfulfilled job-wise.
-[gasps]

283
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,594
-[Kim] Really?
-Yeah.

284
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,730
So, I don't know, I feel like she's just
looking to, like, evolve.

285
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,466
Does she still help you, like,
when you're packing for trips?

286
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,570
-[Kourtney] Or is that all Michael?
-No. That's all my stylist.

287
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,206
-So that's not, like, her thing anymore.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

288
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:04,210
I mean, she does have, like,
a bigger role in designing Kimoji

289
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,412
-and doing stuff like that.
-Yeah.

290
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:11,250
But I do think it's, like, inappropriate
for her to talk to you and not to me.

291
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,920
I mean, don't you think that's just like
a little bit unprofessional?

292
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,590
[Kourtney] I think we were talking about,
like, life in general.

293
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:21,026
And then, because we were talking
about it, then she brought it up.

294
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,396
But that's, like, a convo
she should have with me.

295
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,432
Well, now you have the insider info.

296
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,235
-You can have your answer all prepared.
-Yeah.

297
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,172
I'm just giving you a heads-up,
'cause she's probably gonna say something.

298
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,173
Yeah.

299
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:40,212
Do you find it weird that you're like
"wifey" with my assistant?

300
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,882
I mean, do you?
[chuckles]

301
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:43,883
Kind of.

302
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,819
[Kim] Like, what if, all of a sudden,
I became, like, BFF with Megan?

303
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,588
I think you would definitely be like,
that's weird.

304
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,757
-Yeah.
-[Kim] You know?

305
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,393
Posting every two seconds with Megan.
Megan, Megan, Megan...

306
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,663
-"Oh, my God, my wife, my wife, my wife."
-[chuckles]

307
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,665
-[Kim] It's just, like, funny.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

308
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,035
[upbeat music]

309
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:08,874
Thank you.

310
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,944
-Hey, Khlo.
-Hello.

311
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,179
[laughter]

312
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:18,884
Look at you! You look so... good.

313
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,819
-Hi. Kourtney.
-I'm Sue.

314
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,788
{\an8}-Nice to meet you.
-Hi, I'm Sue.

315
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,291
{\an8}-I'm Khloé.
-Nice to meet you. Thanks for being here.

316
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,759
-It's a pleasure.
-Kim. Nice to meet you.

317
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,360
So, before we get started,
I want to make sure you guys

318
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,062
know a few things
about Planned Parenthood.

319
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,332
We've been around for 100 years.
We just celebrated our 100th anniversary.

320
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,534
-Happy birthday.
-[Sue] Thank you. Thank you.

321
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,403
[Sue] So, one in five women
of reproductive age

322
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,004
will go to a Planned Parenthood.

323
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:43,709
We primarily provide lifesaving cancer
screenings, STD treatments, birth control.

324
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,412
Ninety percent of the work that we do
is preventive care.

325
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,547
-So, let me show you around. All right.
-[Khloé] Yeah.

326
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,517
[Sue] This is a pretty normal exam room.

327
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,521
We operate our own lab so that we can do
tests in real time. So that if you...

328
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,924
How many Planned Parenthoods
are in, like, California?

329
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,026
[Sue] There are many, many clinics.

330
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,396
California sees about one and a half
million patient visits each year.

331
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,598
These are thank-you letters
from our patients.

332
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:10,569
[Khloé] Aw. "I literally have no one else
to help me."

333
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,870
That's so sad.

334
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,639
-[knock on door]
-[Sue] Come on in, you guys.

335
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,474
-[Khloé] Hello.
-[Sue] Melissa and Jackie...

336
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,877
{\an8}They are health educators. They work
with high school students and teachers.

337
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:22,014
[Sue] If there's a question
that anyone has, they've gotten it.

338
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,683
[Kim] What is the weirdest question
you guys have gotten?

339
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,920
Well, we did get, "Can you use
a Snickers wrapper as a condom?"

340
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,388
-Stop.
-[Kim chuckles]

341
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,656
[Sue] Well, can you?

342
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,325
-You shouldn't.
-[Khloé] Oh, my gosh.

343
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:38,030
So we focus on preventing STDs,
birth control, abstinence.

344
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,432
But we also focus a lot on healthy
relationships.

345
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,368
[Melissa] Each of us has rights
in a relationship

346
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,237
and it's really important to be able
to exercise those rights.

347
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,940
You'll see here
we have relationship declarations.

348
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,809
So, there are statements
on each of these that

349
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,444
we would invite each of you to fill out

350
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,413
that you want to hold true
for yourselves, right?

351
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,749
So, "I deserve..."
and then you put whatever you want.

352
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,519
So, for example, someone could say, like,
"I can communicate respectfully."

353
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,455
Or "I can listen to my partner."

354
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,923
[Kim] Yeah. I can...

355
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,594
be myself.

356
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:13,632
I have the right to do whatever
the [bleep] I want to do at all times.

357
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,566
[Melissa] Okay.

358
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,168
[Kourtney] I don't know
if I can even do this.

359
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,837
Kourtney, you can't do this? Just do it.

360
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,240
[tense music]

361
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,712
[Khloé] Kourtney, no one's judging you.

362
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,881
"I deserve..." What do you deserve?

363
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,316
Kourtney just doesn't like
to be put on the spot,

364
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,452
but I also think that it's, like,
a little bit deeper.

365
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,622
She's been in
an unhealthy relationship for so long

366
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,690
that she didn't know what to write.

367
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:43,095
I think it's time she should figure out
what she deserves in a relationship.

368
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,566
{\an8}[dramatic music]

369
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,838
Kourtney. "I deserve..."
What do you deserve? To be happy?

370
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,673
-[Kourtney] Yeah. Okay.
-Okay.

371
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,443
-Do you deserve to smile?
-[Kourtney] Yes.

372
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,582
-I can be myself in my relationships now.
-I'll just say, "To live my life," okay?

373
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,986
-Live that life, girl. Live that life.
-Do it.

374
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,855
[Khloé] There you go. Good job, K.

375
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,826
Amazing. Thank you. So, do you all want
to share one out loud, or...

376
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:18,430
Um, I... have the right to live my life.

377
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,967
Because that's what I'm doing right now,
and it's really exciting.

378
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,637
I deserve to have peace and communication.

379
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,206
You do.

380
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,209
I can be myself in my relationships.

381
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,378
So, how did it feel to assert these rights
for yourselves?

382
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,683
-Good. Kourtney, how did it feel for you?
-It was a little bit difficult.

383
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,252
She's not good at expressing her feelings.

384
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,286
[Kourtney] Mm-mm.

385
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:45,491
I had no idea this is what they do
at Planned Parenthood.

386
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,025
Nice to meet you guys.

387
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:52,264
So far, I love the services they offer.
I think it's so educational. I'm into it.

388
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,666
[Sue] All right, you're gonna meet
with some of our patients.

389
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,703
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-If you guys want to sit down...

390
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,807
-How was your tour? Was it good?
-Yeah, it was really nice.

391
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,809
[Kim] Are you guys all patients here?

392
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:08,113
{\an8}-[woman] Um, yes.
-I'm Novelyn. I'm 44 years old.

393
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,649
[Novelyn] I've been going
to Planned Parenthood since I was 16.

394
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,886
Last year, um,
I found a lump in my right armpit.

395
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,121
[Novelyn] I said, "You know what,
I'll go to Planned Parenthood."

396
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:21,360
The nurse practitioner gave me an exam
and as soon as she touched it, I knew.

397
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,029
[somber music]

398
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:24,997
[Novelyn] And she knew.

399
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:30,169
And she just let me have my moment,
my tears coming down my face,

400
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:35,174
and, you know, she quickly sent me
to get a mammogram and an ultrasound

401
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,510
and then, less than a week later,
I was diagnosed with breast cancer.

402
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,949
The compassion that they gave to me
set the tone

403
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,018
for how I was gonna end up fighting

404
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:50,722
and, you know, 360,000 women
get breast exams here, so...

405
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,558
And I happen to be one of 'em.

406
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,493
[Khloé] Thank you for sharing
your story with us.

407
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,761
Yeah.

408
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:59,698
{\an8}Um, I'll go next. I, uh...
I'm Adeline. I'm 30.

409
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:03,936
Four years ago, I found myself pregnant
and I had missed one pill,

410
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,638
as so many women often do and...

411
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,507
That's how she got pregnant
with her first son.

412
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,175
[Adeline] Yeah, see? It happens.

413
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,211
I was in a very new relationship.

414
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,581
We hardly knew each other
and I was at the peak of my career.

415
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,951
[Adeline] I was traveling a whole lot
and so it just wasn't gonna work for me.

416
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,254
I scheduled an appointment
at Planned Parenthood to get an abortion,

417
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,556
and I started to have second thoughts,

418
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:28,293
and when I went in, the doctor
sensed my hesitation and she's like,

419
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,664
"You are so early in your pregnancy.
Go home. Take the night to sleep on it."

420
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,801
I actually insisted. I was like,
"I'm already here. I'm just nervous."

421
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:39,204
And she didn't budge.
She said, "It's not happening today.

422
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,873
My conscience isn't gonna let me do this,
so go home."

423
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,209
Uh, eight months later, I had my son.

424
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,246
[Adeline] And he's incredible.

425
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,782
He's the coolest little dude.
And I can't imagine my life without him.

426
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,385
So, had I gone anywhere else other than
Planned Parenthood,

427
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,486
he wouldn't be here today.

428
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,558
The perception of Planned Parenthood
is that it's this, like, abortion clinic.

429
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,927
That's nothing like what it's like.

430
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,764
Hearing that firsthand
really made it real for me.

431
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,201
Hearing the stories for sure
was eye-opening.

432
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,502
{\an8}[Kim] Mm-hmm.

433
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:14,673
{\an8}Uh, I started, um,
dating my best guy friend when I was 23.

434
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,311
And he and I stopped using protection
without getting tested first.

435
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,848
And I was like, "That was a silly
decision, like, we should go get tested

436
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,750
and just make sure everything is okay."

437
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,485
[Kelly] We didn't have an appointment.
We just walked in.

438
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,154
And he got pulled to the back first.

439
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,957
And, it was, like, a 15-minute test,
where they prick your finger.

440
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,425
And then,
it takes 15 minutes to get results.

441
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:34,526
Well, they could tell that fast?

442
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,994
-Yeah.
-Oh, wow.

443
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:41,033
And so he came back out 15 minutes later
with pieces of paper in his hands. Um...

444
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,903
And he was like, he said,
"I tested positive for HIV."

445
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,776
And I was, like, on my phone.
I was like... "Yeah, okay. Whatever."

446
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:55,314
And he didn't say anything
and I grabbed the pieces of paper from him

447
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,417
and I saw
that there was information about HIV.

448
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:03,622
In my mind, I was like, "There is no way
that I don't have this.

449
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,524
Like, I have this."

450
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,027
[Kelly] Um, they took me back
and they pricked my finger.

451
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,597
At the moment, I was like, "This is
the longest 15 minutes of my life."

452
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,068
[Kelly] Fifteen minutes later,
they took us both back

453
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,737
and told us that we both
had tested positive.

454
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,208
Whoa.

455
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:27,245
Planned Parenthood, like, they were
compassionate and understanding,

456
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,048
and they told me,
"You know, your life isn't over.

457
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,518
This is manageable.
You can live a normal life with this."

458
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,855
Planned Parenthood
basically kept me alive.

459
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,559
I'm a big fan of Planned Parenthood now.

460
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,694
Meeting all the girls
and hearing their stories,

461
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,496
and seeing how many women have been helped

462
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,466
by some of the services
they have to offer, I...

463
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:51,670
I mean, I think people need to be more
educated before they form opinions,

464
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:55,407
and that's what I'm grateful
that I had the opportunity to do today.

465
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,810
Well, we just want to say thank you
so much for, like, being so vulnerable

466
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,045
and sharing your stories.

467
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,849
And, you know, we definitely
wanted to be educated on this,

468
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:08,653
but also just thank you guys
for everything and for all that you do.

469
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,688
Thank you.

470
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,059
{\an8}[upbeat music]

471
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,467
Before we go on any trip,

472
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,971
my sisters and I love to do a fitting
and get outfits together.

473
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,506
[indistinct chatter]

474
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,676
I think Cannes is a fun time
to just, like, dress up

475
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,980
and not wear things
that I would just wear in LA.

476

-Ooh. Hi, Kourt.
-Hi.

{\an8}[Kourtney] So I'm not gonna wear
these red heels to the airport.

478
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,924
-Why not?
-[Kourtney] For a 12 billion hour flight?

479
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,660
But you take them off.
I always wear heels to a plane.

480
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,729
I mean... and then,
on the plane, you bring slides,

481
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,365
like in your roller bag,
so if you go to the bathroom or something.

482
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,467
I don't even need slides. I have socks.

483
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,670
Right, but if you'd want to go
to the bathroom without shoes on?

484
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,206
-[Kourtney] I have done it many times.
-Oh. Okay.

485
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,909
-[Kourtney] Wait. Do you guys like this?
-I'm not mad at this at all.

486
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,077
-[Kim] Hi. How are you?
-[Stephanie] Good, thanks.

487
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,480
-[Kim] What are you doing?
-[Kourtney] We're doing a fitting.

488
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,583
-You can see the looks.
-[Stephanie] Is this, like, an LAX vibe?

489
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,619
Or is this like she lands in Cannes
and gets off the plane there?

490
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:20,325
I know that Steph has gone to Kourtney
about how she feels and not me.

491
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,661
And, now we're at Kourt's house,
and, obviously,

492
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:25,163
I don't want to talk to her
in front of everyone else.

493
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,099
It's just so weird
that she would go to Kourt.

494
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,002
And, like, she obviously knows
you're Kourt's gonna tell you.

495
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,538
Yeah. I just feel, like, awkward.

496
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,673
I love this.

497
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:39,311
[Kourtney] That is pajamas
for the morning, went to have breakfast.

498
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:42,013
There's three pajama looks
that are just for the morning.

499
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,916
She's gonna be in her pajamas,
drinking champagne.

500
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,384

{\an8}[phone dings]

503
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:04,302
{\an8}Reminder, I have to pack those sunglasses
for that post I have to do.

504
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,572
[line ringing]

505
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,343
{\an8}-[Scott] <i>Hi.</i>
-Oh, hi.

506
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,578
It's, like, shocking you answered
my phone call.

507
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,746
<i>Why?</i>

508
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,249
[Khloé]
'Cause I've been calling you non-stop.

509
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,286
<i>Yeah, my phone broke, though.
That was the problem.</i>

510
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,889
-The good old "phone broke."
-<i>Yeah.</i>

511
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:29,194
So, Kourt told me you were being,
like, aggressive towards her.

512
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,129
<i>Obviously, Kourt's being a [bleep] idiot.</i>

513
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,198
[tense music]

514
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,334
Like, I get whatever you guys
are going through,

515
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,204
but she's still gonna be
the mother of your kids, no matter what,

516
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:43,308
and we, I think, always have
to keep that into perspective.

517
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,743
<i>It's just hard, you know.</i>

518
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,045
<i>I never thought I'd ever go through
anything like this.</i>

519
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,816
No matter how mad or upset,
or, like, [bleep] up the situation is,

520
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,754
we can't say certain things,
'cause it's really hard to take it back.

521
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,757
<i>Yeah. I mean, I agree with you.</i>

522
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:02,160
<i>I really was just acting like a, you know,
kind of a hothead,</i>

523
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,530
<i>but, like, it got just, like, way too out
of hand. You know what I mean?</i>

524
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,831
Yeah.

525
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,568
Long story short,
I was acting a bit immature,

526
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,003
and I said a few things
that weren't appropriate.

527
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,240
And I'm not, like, gonna regret that,

528
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,076
because it was, like,
that's how I felt at the time.

529
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,211
[Scott] You can understand,
we have a lot of history.

530
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,846
Yup, I get it.

531
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,848
-So it's hard.
-[Khloé] I feel you.

532
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,285
So now you're going to Cannes?

533
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,754
[Scott] <i>Yeah, like, an appearance
at a party there.</i>

534
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,623
<i>I probably should stay home,</i>

535
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,793
<i>but I'm sure I won't get out
of the desperation that I have.</i>

536
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,194
[chuckles]

537
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,131
-<i>All right, I love you, Khlo Mom.</i>
-Love you too. Be good.

538
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,000
-<i>Okay, bye.</i>
-[Khloé] Bye.

{\an8}[sighs]

542
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,418
[Khadijah] My lower back hurts so bad.

543
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,687
{\an8}I should actually wear hoods more often.

544
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,090
{\an8}-[Khloé] You like hoods?
-[Malika] Yeah.

545
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,559
-I look, like, cooler.
-[Khadijah] I prefer, like, hats.

546
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,563
[Khloé] So Kim and Steph
are having issues.

547
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,298
-[Malika] Wait. What?
-Um...

548
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,101
[Khloé] And it's awkward, 'cause,
you know, now they're friends.

549
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,070
Once you cross those lines,
it's hard to get them back.

550
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,339
-Yeah.
-It's completely different,

551
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:25,910
but, like, I know we worked together,
and it was hard.

552
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,546
I felt like I couldn't ask you
to do things,

553
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,349
'cause I felt weird, like,
bossing you around.

554
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,086
Right. The line can easily get blurred,

555
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,356
but Kim does have to communicate
to Stephanie.

556
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,791
[Khloé] Totally.

557
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:43,461
You also know how Kim is.
She's not the most confrontational.

558
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,132
But that's where the problem comes in,
'cause things just boil over,

559
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,902
and all of a sudden, it'll be like, "Oh,
I can't have her work for me anymore."

560
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,305
[Malika] She doesn't want it
to get to that point.

561
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,507
Maybe you should help her.

562
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,876
I mean, if anybody knows,
you've been here before.

563
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,878
Malika and I used to work together,

564
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:05,116
and I do think it's really hard
to separate business and personal.

565
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,551
[Malika] I don't want to work for you.

566
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,987
Maybe I just need a break,
like, from you, period.

567
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,355
I had no idea.

568

[sobbing]

569
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,560
Kim needs to be really honest with Steph
so it doesn't get out of control,

570
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:19,264
because Kim may end up losing
both her employee and her friend.

571
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,467
[upbeat music]

572
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,981
-[Virginie] Hi. How are you?
-Hi. How are you?

573
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,352
{\an8}Before this trip really gets started,
I am meeting one of my fans.

574
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:46,391
Her name is @Queen_KourtneyK,
and I follow her on Instagram and Twitter,

575
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,193
and I've been following her for years.

576
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,628
I'm Kendall. Nice to meet you.

577
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,631
-Oh, my God. No. Oh, my God.
-I know. I said don't cry.

578
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,267
She lives in France. I wrote her and said,

579
00:28:56,334 --> 00:29:00,605
"You know, I'm in Cannes. Do you want
to meet me and Kendall for ice cream?"

580
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,475
-Kenny, will you sign her <i>Vogue?</i>
-[Kendall] Of course.

581
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:08,213
[Kourtney] I feel like we've just had,
you know, a good time together,

582
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,648
and we really were excited
to just meet her.

583
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,484
-I'm sorry.
-[Kendall] Aw.

584
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,286
-Don't cry. Don't cry.
-[Virginie] I love you so much.

00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,521
Aw.

587
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,862
-[Simon] I think he's ready to meet.
-He would just meet us at the bar, right?

588
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,231
-[Simon] Yeah. I told him.
-[Kourtney] What?

589
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,967
-It's just intense. It's really intense.
-[Kourtney] Guess what.

590
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,970
-It's not as intense as you think.
-[Kendall] I think it is.

591
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,373
{\an8}You're more fun than you've ever been,
and you're, like, happy,

592
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,575
{\an8}and you got a 23-year-old stallion...

593
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,144
-[Kourtney] Twenty-four.
-Twenty-four.

594
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,514
...who, like, is obsessed with you,
and is easy.

595
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,583
My vibe right now is just living life.

596
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,887
It's kind of weird
'cause I haven't seen Kourt

597
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,522
with another guy, like, in ten years,

598
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,824
or however long it's been,
so, it's interesting.

599
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,360
-It's fun. She's free.
-[chuckles]

600
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,563
[Simon] You have to live your life,
and hiding doesn't make it fun at all.

601
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,865
Right, and also,
where am I gonna hide here?

602
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,133
-Right?
-You know...

603
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,301
[Simon] And why would you hide that man?

604
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,569
-I would never hide him.
-Right.

605
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,606
I would literally parade him all day long,
shirt off.

606
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,743
-Where is that man?
-[Kourtney] Waiting for us on the boat.

607
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,111
[Simon] Okay, let's go see him.

609
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,958
{\an8}-[Kim] Feels like it's so spicy.
-[Kris] I love spicy.

610
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,594
I hate spicy.
These are the things I hate in life,

611
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,864
-mustard, cilantro and blue cheese.
-[Kris] Mm-hmm.

612
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,568
-Who hates blue cheese? Nobody.
-[Kim] Everyone.

613
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,437
[phone ringing]

614
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,606
-[Kendall] <i>Hey.</i>
-[Kim] Who is that?

615
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,076
{\an8}-It's Kendall Jenner. At Cannes.
-Oh. Hi.

616
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,079
-[Kris] Are Scott and Bella there?
-[Kendall] <i>They just got in today.</i>

617
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,216
-Scott and Bella are on time?
-They looked so desperate at the airport.

618
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,418
Like, who goes to LAX together?

619
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,453
[Kim] It's not a good look for Scott.

620
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,454
-[Kendall] <i>At all.</i>
-At all.

621
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,889
[Kendall] <i>He talked to me about it.</i>

622
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,092
<i>He thinks it is.
And I said, "Are you nuts?</i>

623
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,027
<i>Are you actually not well?"</i>

624
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,930
<i>He was like,
"Yeah, I'm doing it to make Kourtney mad."</i>

625
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,766
<i>I said, "You're not gonna make her mad
for the right reasons."</i>

626
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,803
I think it's clear to everyone
that Scott is doing this

627
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,072
just to try to one-up Kourtney.

628
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,374
[Kim] And that seems super malicious.

629
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,743
Kourtney's genuinely trying to go away
and have a good time

630
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,181
and he's trying to, like, freak her out
and make Kourtney think

631
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,950
that there's gonna be
some crazy drama run-in.

632
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:30,788
It's just so ridiculous. I could just see
this is not gonna end well.

635
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,535
Kendall and I have been having so much fun
with our friends

636
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,506
since we've arrived in Cannes.
Like, it's just so amazing...

637
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,542
to go jet skiing,
and go to fun dinners, and go out

638
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,379
and get to spend really good time
with my sister.

639
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,881
Like, I just feel like I really need it.

640
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,251
[inaudible]

641
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:09,394
We are definitely living the life
in France,

642
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,431
but my number one thing is that
I'm not flying home alone.

643
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,900
-[Kendall] Same. No, literally same.
-So whatever you do, I do.

644
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,069
-And whatever I do, you do.
-[Kendall] Literally same.

645
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:22,440
-I do not want to fly home alone at all.
-[Kourtney] So we're together.

646
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,475
[Kourtney] This trip is so amazing.

647
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:30,448
We've just had a good time making memories
with no Scott drama and everything.

648
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:34,986
But then I'm like, there's really
only one nightclub that people go to,

649
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:39,190
so I'm just hoping that Scott
and I don't run into each other.

650
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,559
-[Kourtney] Shall we?
-Yeah.

651
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,263
Should we hold hands so I don't fall?

652
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,670
[upbeat music]

653
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,783
{\an8}No chocolate, guys. Come on.
You had pizza and ice cream.

654
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,752
I see your belly button.
[blows raspberry]

655
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,120
[North] No, don't.

656
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,655
[Khloé] Have you talked to Steph yet?

657
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,390
[Kim] I mean, I haven't talked to her yet.

658
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,893
I definitely want to work it out
and just figure out what's going on

659
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,028
'cause I love Steph.

660
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:22,166
I just am more, like, talking behind
my back to Kourt, to my sister,

661
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,168
just about how she should approach me.

662
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:28,506
-Like I just like to know that info first.
-But then you got to tell her that.

663
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,575
[suspenseful music]

664
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,711
It's not her fault
because you've never said anything.

665
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:37,148
At the end of the day,
you are her employer, friend or not.

666
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:41,052
And you just have to set that tone.
There's nothing negative about that.

667
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,022
[Kim] I know that Steph and I
have to talk.

668
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,057
It would make me sad
if we didn't work together,

669
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,993
but if she would be ready
to move on, I mean,

670
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,862
that's just what I'm gonna have to accept.

671
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,732
Grow some balls, Kim.

672
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,236
-I will, after this nap.
-[chuckles]

673
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,738
[upbeat music]

674
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,444
{\an8}[Kris] This is such a beautiful color.

675
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,280
It's almost like butterscotch.

676
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:13,351
-Like you just want to lick it.
-Oh, my God, so there's these two posts.

677
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:17,155
Says, "Kourtney Kardashian
shows off her figure in a black swimsuit

678
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,158
as she canoodles
with new boyfriend, Younes,

679
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,826
and takes a ride on a Jet Ski in Cannes."

680
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,294
Then right above it, it says,

681
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,497
"Shirtless Scott Disick can't keep
his hands off bikini-clad Bella."

682
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,433
[Khloé] It's literally like the battles.

683
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,636
I feel like Kourt is just living her life
on the boat,

684
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,272
like, with her guy, like, chilling.

685
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:39,010
And Scott is, like, trying to one-up Kourt
with every picture. New girl. New thing.

686
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,445
-[Khloé] Lovey-dovey.
-[Kim] Yeah. Kourtney's is not, like...

687
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:42,213
it's just naturally happening.

688
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,216
-Right. Scott...
-[Kim] Scott's, like, making it happen.

689
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,853
-It's all a jealousy thing. Totally.
-Yeah.

690
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,589
-[Khloé] It's just nuts.
-Why don't you call her?

692
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,826
{\an8}-[Kourtney] <i>Yeah?</i>
-Hey, girl.

693
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:58,029
{\an8}Hey, Kourt. How's the south of France?

694
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,598
<i>It's fun.
We went to look for a crepe shop,</i>

695
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,835
<i>walked around for like 30 minutes,
couldn't find it.</i>

696
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:08,239
Who cares? What's up with the guy
rubbing oil all over your body on a yacht?

697
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,541
Like, what the [bleep] are you talking
about crepes for?

698
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,910
<i>Actually, I haven't put on sunscreen once.</i>

699
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,780
-<i>I've been too busy.</i>
-Okay, then it's just rubbing your body.

700
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,716
I mean, you are living your life, girl.

701
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,486
-[Khloé] You guys look so good.
-[Simon] <i>Hi.</i>

702
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,287
[Khloé] Hi, how are you?

703
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,256

-[Simon] <i>Has Khloé met Younes yet?</i>

704
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,391
[Khloé] No, I haven't,
I haven't met Younes yet.

705
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,094
And this is our... this is our mom.

-[Younes] <i>Well, I got to go.</i>
-[Kris] Hi.

-[Younes] <i>Nice to see you.</i>
-Nice to see you too.

00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,334
-[Younes] <i>Yeah.</i>
-[Kourtney] <i>Okay.</i>

Oh, my God.

What is so crazy to me,
it's like picture wars.

713
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,482
So, if a picture of you comes out
with your friend,

714
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,784
then the other one tries to one-up you.

715
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,387
[Kourtney] <i>He's gonna be
on a jet ski tomorrow.</i>

716
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,421
[Khloé] Oh, for sure.

717
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,158
Then he's gonna be at a crepe store,
or wherever you just were.

718
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,528
Like, to me, I feel like I'm watching,
like, a Ping-Pong match. Like...

719
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:07,031
<i>Yeah, but it's weird
'cause I'm, like, not in the tournament.</i>

720
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,901
[Khloé] Well, anyways,
you are a class act.

721
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,936
-<i>Okay. Love you.</i>
-[Khloé] Love you too.

722
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,105
-[Kris] Love you.
-Bye, guys.

723
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,008
Wait, who's Younes?

724
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,177
Her friend. I've never met him
until just now.

725
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:24,248
She's finally doing something for herself.
And I am just proud of her for, like...

726
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,083
-For having fun.
-...having fun.

Actually, Kanye spends
a lot of time in here.

730
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:46,270
-[Kim] And these couches are not comfy.
-Yeah, it's not comfortable.

00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,072
Yeah. Not at all.

dance around

not being confrontational anymore.

00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,716
Like, I want to be up-front.

737
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,285
I want to be able to say
when something's bothering me.

738
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,187
I don't want to be that pushover person.

-Like I hate serious conversations.
-I know.

You're making me nervous.
I'm getting sweaty.

I'm uncomfortable. She's uncomfortable.
Like, I just don't know what to say.

You're making me nervous.

746
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:31,182
I was talking to Kourt,
and she expressed to me that you,

747
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,352
are wanting to figure out
what your next steps were

748
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,288
and how do you grow
from being an assistant?

I feel like Kourtney and I's conversation

754

was, like, more like
of an in-passing thing.

755
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,674
Kourtney was just, like, saying, you know,
that she was feeling unfulfilled.

756
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:57,875
And then, I was like, "No, I can relate.

I'm in like a weird place in my life."

and starting off and 22,

759
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,651
and I'm not, like, 30 and having babies
and being married,

760

so I'm, like, trying to, like, navigate,
like, what is my next step.

don't want to, like, dump stuff on you.

I would've never known she had an issue
if she hadn't spoken to Kourtney about it.

764
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,966
Of course, I wish she came to me
instead of Kourt,

765
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,703
but, like, I'm really glad that she did
speak up so that I can, like, jump in,

766
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,272
and, like, take over
and really have this talk.

767
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,275
I do want you
to feel like you're fulfilled

768

and that you're doing stuff that you love.

769

We're starting all of these companies
together, like, from scratch.

770
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,718
And I just feel like all of those,
maybe you manage all of those,

771
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:43,654
instead of just being my assistant.

772
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,589
I mean, I would love that.
Like, obviously, like,

773

I'm super invested
in everything that you do.

774
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,864
I don't want you to think that,
like, me being friends with Kourtney,

775
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,733
I don't want that to, like,
be a thing or like,

make you feel like
I'm straying or like not loyal

{\an8}[upbeat music]

791
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,478
[background chatter]

00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:46,851
[dance music playing]

793
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,492
[Kourtney] Our trip to Cannes
has been amazing.

794
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:59,397
It was just fun and, like, freeing
to just go to Cannes, have the best trip,

795
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:03,134
have new experiences,
hang out with my friends,

796
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,370
have such an amazing time with Kendall,

797
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,907
and just, like,
not worry about anyone else.

798
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:13,644
[crowd cheering]

799
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,283
[artist] <i>Thank you, y'all.
Everybody get 'round the monitor.</i>

800
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,385
<i>Have responsible safe sex tonight.</i>

801
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:27,024
I think this is one of the first times
when I was really able to separate Scott

802
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,295
and what he was doing, and just, like,
really be able to have an amazing time

803
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,998
and not be worried
about what he was up to.

804
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,902
{\an8}[Kourtney] And I'm not trying to throw
anything in anyone's face,

805
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,604
but I'm also not gonna hide.

806
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,140
[music fades]

807
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,243
{\an8}I'm going to start a really crazy diet.

808
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,746
{\an8}We've got to have a slice of pizza
to say goodbye.

809
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,648
{\an8}-We can have one slice.
-Yeah.

810
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,486
{\an8}-[Kris] We're in Cleveland.
-[Kourtney] Go, Cavs.

811
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,989
{\an8}Corey said,
"100 percent don't go to the game."

812
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,492
{\an8}-You're so cute, Khloé.
-[man] [bleep] the Kardashians!

813
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,594
{\an8}[laughs]
Perfect.

814
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,830
{\an8}It looked like it was some big soap opera.

815
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,998
{\an8}I can't, like, not just live my life.

816
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,334
{\an8}-I think you're not getting it.
-I get it
