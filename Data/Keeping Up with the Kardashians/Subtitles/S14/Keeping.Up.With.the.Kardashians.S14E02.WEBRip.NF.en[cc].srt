[Khloé] Does this hurt?

-You ever been hit by a car?
-[Khloé laughs]

00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,682
-[Khloé] Don't say that.

You are going down. You're going down!

Ow, this hurts so bad!

behind nothing again.

22
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,827
[Kourtney] Turn around.
I'm gonna shoot you in the ass.

-Not from too close.
-Ten feet away.

-Oh.

-I watch in minutes.

-Minutes? It's not movie time.
-[Reign] Minutes.

Yeah. I watch minutes.

00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,509
Moana's in the other room.

-Come on. Come on, Lovey.
-[Kris] Oh, dear.

Oh, okay.

53
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,948
[Kris] So, tell me about your trip.

54
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,652
It's 17 girls as of now.

55
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,588
-[Kris] Seventeen girls? You're brave.
-Yeah.

56
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,092
-And how long are you gone?
-For four nights.

57
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,161
Are you gonna do goodie bags
for the plane?

58
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,095
[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,429
-What are you doing?
-Steph and I,

60
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,299
like, we ordered
these little, like, Mexican-looking bags,

61
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:52,038
and then we put a bathing suit
for everyone that says SPF 1942.

62
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,708
-[Kris] So cute.
-And so, we ordered those for everyone.

63
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,845
We ordered, like, two pairs of sunglasses
for everyone.

64
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,747
-Oh, really?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

65
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,148
We're excited.

66
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,250
-[upbeat music playing]
-That's cool.

67
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:11,791
For my birthday, I decided
to take all my friends to Mexico.

68
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,394
Tristan has a game, so Khloé's not coming.

69
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:19,933
We are gonna have the time of our lives,
just fun girls' weekend.

70
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,936
So, when you're in Mexico,

71
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,572
I'd love to spend some time
with Scott and the kids.

72
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,607
-If you're okay with that.
-Okay. Yeah.

73
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,877
'Cause I think we could think of a couple
really fun things to do with them

74
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,978
and take them to dinner.

75
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,814
I think he was gonna stay here
while I'm gone.

76
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,849
That's even better. I'm excited.

77
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,453
Do you guys want to hang out with Lovey
while I'm gone?

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,690
We could watch <i>Moana</i> at my house.
Do you want to do that?

79
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,925
[Reign] I want to see <i>Moana.</i>

80
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,427
-[Kourtney] You're gonna fall.
-[Penelope laughs]

81
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,928
[Penelope] I want to fall.

82
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,764
-[Penelope laughs]
-What about this kind of pinch?

83
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,768
-[Kourtney] Hey.
-[Kris] Oh, whoa!

84
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,738
-Hey. No.
-This is dangerous.

85
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,709
I just came for a visit, not a...
And it's not a hospital visit.

86
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,444
[Kris] All right, you two have fun.

87
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,779
I got to go.

88
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,048
-[Kourtney] Should I wrestle you?
-[Penelope giggling]

00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,692
{\an8}Hi! Oh, we have a double visitor?

91
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,696
-Hi, Kourt. Hi, gorg.
-[Larsa] I love you. You look so cute.

92
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,032
Oh, my God, you're getting... I can't.

93
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,636
-Hi. Hey.
-[Kim] Hey.

94
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:35,074
-Kimberly, you are so hot.
-[Joyce] What's happening?

95
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,342
Oh, my God, thank you.

96
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,345
-Can we be honest about last night?
-[Kim] What?

97
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,981
Scott wants to go on a trip
with me and the kids

98
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,417
for his birthday after Mexico.

99
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,186
[Khloé] Why the [bleep] are you going out
of town with Scott again?

100
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,421
Aren't we over this?

101
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,857
[tense music]

102
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,026
We are gonna have kids together

103
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,495
-for our whole lives.
-[Khloé] Yeah, but you don't have, like...

104
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,330
Just 'cause you have kids together
doesn't mean you...

105
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,667
I mean, listen, you do your thing,
but you're definitely doing...

106
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,202
mixed messages.

107
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:09,809
Can you believe that after we catch Scott
with a girl in Costa Rica,

108
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,713
-after Scott's now, you know, around...
-No wonder he still does it.

109
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,915
-Yeah, they are now going on another...
-It's never gonna change.

110
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,617
-...vacation together as a family?
-I...

111
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,718
I can't believe her.

112
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,689
I just think that's, like...
You're just playing with fire.

113
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,825
-[Kourtney] How is that playing with fire?
-[Kim] Thank you.

114
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,327
-I feel the same exact way.
-[Kourtney] No, but, like...

115
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,728
Okay, stop being so defensive.

116
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,229
[Kourtney]
No, no, no. I just want to know.

117
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,231
And I'm trying to tell you
but when you're yelling down my throat,

118
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,033
it makes me want to yell back at you.

119
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,134
[Khloé] Roar!

120
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,171
But you're going on vacation, and he asked
if you wanted to share a room and

121
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,673
-there's only one left with a King bed.
-No, we're not sharing a room!

122
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,543
-[Kim] Because that's all that's left.
-[Khloé] You're so full of [bleep].

123
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,245
-We're not sharing a room.
-Yeah, right.

124
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,750
I think Scott and I definitely
have our own way of doing things

125
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,854
when it comes to co-parenting,
but I don't expect anyone to understand,

126
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,222
like, how we do things.

127
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,558
It's just, like, but then he comes to us

128
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:02,095
and talks to us about, like,
the mixed signals and I just...

129
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,965
I think that you do have to be more firm
unless you just like giving mixed signals.

130
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:06,999
No, I don't.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,670
[Khloé] We're walking to set.
Your life is too complicated.

132
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,206
We did Aspen and Cabo and we were fine.

133
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,775
-And then what happened in Costa Rica?
-[Kim] We'll go with Khloé.

134
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,543
What happened in Costa Rica?

135
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,413
[upbeat music]

136
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,255
[Kris] Mason!

137
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,258
-How is my boy?
-Good.

138
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,728
Hi! Oh, and there's Northie.

139
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,963
What?

140
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,232
-[Kris] What? What?
-Wanna say hi to Lovey?

141
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,166
[Kris] Come here!

142
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,902
How happy am I to see you guys?

143
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,872
Remember right over there, P,
when you peed on the floor?

144
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,073
What?

145
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,508
[Scott] On my birthday,
she peed right over there.

146
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,343
Stop. I love that about her.

147
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,745
-[Scott] Yeah, it's a good kid.
-Yeah, she's great.

148
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,147
You gonna do it again today?

149
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,448
-No.
-[Kris] No.

150
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,784
-[Kris laughs]
-I didn't know.

151
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,286
You had a whole, like, team tonight.

152
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,157
You brought the whole cast

153
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,591
-and characters.
-The whole campers.

154
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,528
-Speaking of camping...
-[Northie babbling]

155
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,595
Yeah?

156
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:10,630
[Kris] I was thinking.

157
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,033
-When I was young...
-Okay.

158
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:19,839
My grandmother and my grandfather
used to go on major camping excursions.

159
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,575
-Okay.
-So, I was thinking, maybe we could do

160
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,913
an outdoor camping trip in my backyard,
or your backyard to start with.

161
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,448
Mase, you want to go camping

162
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,683
-in the backyard?
-We could even have an outdoor

163
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,652
-movie experience.
-[Mason] Yeah.

164
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,053
[Scott] You want to sleep in tents?

165
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,922
[Kris] You want to sleep in a tent?

166
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,224
-I am.
-Are you in?

167
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,493
Who's in? Raise your hand if you're in.

168
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,728
Uh, we're all in.

169
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,831
Okay, camping at my house.

170
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,834
While Kourtney's in Mexico,

171
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,203
Scott and I
are going to spend a little bit

172
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,537
of time together with the kids.

173
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,273
And I think that,
since he's on daddy duty,

174
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,709
camping is something really fun
to do together.

175
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,911
Who likes s'mores?

176
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
-[Scott] Oh.
-Raise your hand if you like s'mores!

177
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,316
Whoo! We love s'mores.

178
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,819
-We need big backpacks.
-Yes!

179
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,255
-Can we have music?
-[Kris] We can have music

180
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,424
-if you pick the music.
-[Scott] You gonna have a dance party?

181
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,792
-Uh, yeah.
-[Kris] Okay.

182
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,961
So, what kind of music do you like, Mase?

183
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,863
-Rap.
-[Kris] Uh.

184
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,898
Who's your favorite rapper, Northie?

185
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,936
-Kanye West is my dad!
-[laughs]

186
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,506
But I bet
he's your favorite rapper, right?

187
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,141
[chuckles]

188
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,944
[upbeat music]

189
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,652
{\an8}-[Khloé] <i>It's hot today, Joe.</i>
-[Joe] <i>It is.</i>

190
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,523
-How have you been?
-[Khloé] Good. How about you?

191
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,058
Good, good.
How long since the last workout?

192
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,262
{\an8}-Since the last time I've seen you.
-No way. Okay. We'll see, what...

193
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,397
{\an8}I don't work out in Cleveland. It sucks.

194
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,866
-Why?
-[Khloé] That's a good question.

195
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,903
-No more motivation once you get there?
-Well, I just bought an elliptical.

196
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:00,239
Like, he had a... like, he has a space
for a gym, but it was empty.

197
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,675
But it just came yesterday.
Like, all the equipment.

198
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,910
[Joe] Okay.

199
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,346
[Khloé] I need to bring you there.
You wouldn't go to Cleveland with me?

200
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,415
-If you need to.
-Yeah.

201
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,650
There you go, Joe.

202
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,954
{\an8}-Sorry, guys.
-Thirty minutes late.

203
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,056
-Yet again.
-Sorry, I apologize.

204
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,692
Who the [bleep] are you talking to?

205
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,128
The phone call was not a good idea.

206
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,931
-[tense music]
-Oh, my God.

207
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,067
-[Scott] <i>I'm gonna [bleep] this kid up!</i>
-No...

208
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,043
Last night, I went to dinner with a guy
and was photographed.

209
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,745
And I just felt, you know...

210
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:43,282
I felt like I should give Scott
a heads-up, out of respect,

211
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,953
even though he hasn't done
the same to me in the past.

212
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,222
But the photos never ended up
coming out in the end.

213
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,292
So, it was pretty much all for nothing.

214
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,530
{\an8}What?

215
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,567
[Scott] <i>You don't think
I will [bleep] that kid up!</i>

216
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,305
Okay, I got to go work out.

217
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,641
[whispers]
He's screaming at the top of his lungs.

218
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,509
-[Kourtney] Okay, bye.
-[Khloé] Kourtney, he was screaming.

219
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,846
No, that was not... a good idea.

220
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,582
-That was not a good idea.
-[Kourtney] Okay.

221
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,552
-I don't know what the hell is going on.
-Is he drunk right now?

222
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,888
-He sounds like it.
-That is Belligerent Scott.

223
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,691
[Khloé] Like, what does he think?
He could do whatever?

224
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,527
Exactly.

225
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,596
I go,
"You wouldn't even give me a warning.

226
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,432
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

227
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,403
Should I not do that?
I'm like, "Next time, I won't."

228
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,338
He's like, "There's gonna be a next time?"

229
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,439
Oh, my God.

230
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,742
That's what sent him over, the next time.

231
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,480
I thought it was cool
you were giving him a heads-up

232
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,982
-in case he saw pictures,...
-I said it the next morning, early.

233
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,250
-...or anything of you.
-Right.

234
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,418
Like, I thought that was cool

235
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,220
-'cause you're always sideswiped.
-And I said "I went to dinner with a guy."

236
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:58,691
I'm sure that there will be a next time
that I'm out at dinner with a guy.

237
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,494
Or lunch, or wherever it may be.

238
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,096
Like, I just don't get what he...
It's like, I'm so over that.

239
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,097
-Yeah.
-Like, Scott,

240
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,966
call me a wambulance and move on.

241
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,736
I can't get over it.

242
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:15,107
Honesty is always the best policy,
but maybe for him...

243
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,809
[Kourtney] That's what I said.

244
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:21,781
-Excited to go to Mexico tomorrow?
-Cannot wait to get the hell out of here.

245
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,417
[scoffs]
Do you, baby girl.

246
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,819
[light music]

247
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,094
There is no place like Mexico.

248
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,163
I'm so excited to be here.

249
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:41,434
I've never had all these girls together,
so it'll definitely be interesting.

250
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,335
MILFs gone wild.

251
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,304
-[Veronica] Hi!
-Welcome!

252
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,872
-[Veronica] Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

253
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:47,940
[Veronica laughing]
Oh, my God!

254
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,677
[women screaming, cheering]

255
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,945
[Melissa] Oh, my God!

256
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,315
[laughter, screaming]

257
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,086
-Oh, it's amazing!
-Oh, my God! Best day ever!

258
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,089
-Happy birthday!
-Oh, so warm!

259
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,156
Oh!

260
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,094
-The pool is literally so...
-Whoo! Party!

261
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,362
-You guys are the only people that...
-Come on, guys!

262
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,531
-Oh, come on, Larsa!
-Come on!

263
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,501
You're in a unitard!
You're basically in a swimsuit.

264
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,937
Whoo!

265
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,505
Yeah, Larsa!

266
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,207
[laughter]

267
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,975
Whoo!

268
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,044
[upbeat music playing]

269
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,155
[Scott] Oh, look at this!

270
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,991
-[Kris] I'll get the scooter. Oh, yeah.
-[Scott chuckling]

271
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:39,892
Mason.

272
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,762
-Wait, how do you work this?
-[Scott] You're fine. Just gas it.

273
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,531
-[Kris] This is kind of amazing.
-[Scott] You're killing it.

274
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,635
This is the best Costco trip
I have ever had.

275
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,803
[Kris laughs]

276
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,606
Come on, Mason. Let's go.

277
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,675
Lovey's gonna show you
how it's done, in style.

278
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,579
I wanted to show Scott,
like, what it would be

279
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,415
to find a bunch
of really cool stuff to go camping.

280
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,084
[Kris] I'm prepared.
I'm like a Girl Scout.

281
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,853
Are you planning on setting up
your own tent?

282
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,921
Oh, no.

283
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,357
[Kris] Do they have, like, a portable TV?

284
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,826
We could use a portable TV
for, what, camping?

285
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,094
-For inside the tent.
-No,

286
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,930
this is supposed to be like
a rugged men's campout.

287
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,332
[Kris] Wait, do we need any, like, chairs?

288
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,067
-[Scott] No! We're camping.
-What if we get...

289
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,436
Look, why don't we get
these lounge chairs right there

290
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,105
and you can put the sleeping bag...

291
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,341
-You're supposed to sleep on the floor.
-What? Oh, my God.

292
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,510
Sleeping bags first, people.
I got an agenda here.

293
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,146
Mason, Mason, look at the surfboard.

294
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,248
[Mason] Yeah! That's exactly what I need.

295
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,017
Oy. I can't do this.

296
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,187
Scott might've envisioned
something a little more manly,

297
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,256
but I have something
a little more comfortable in mind.

298
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,492
[Khloé] Yeah, right.
Like, what's he gonna do out there?

299
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,426
Come on.

300
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,961
-I know.
-Like, he wouldn't know what to do.

301
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,063
[Scott] All right,
should we go over the checklist?

302
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,299
-[Kris] Yeah.
-[Scott] We need blankets, pillows,

303
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,168
outdoor fire pit, a fire extinguisher.
We need a barbecue lighter.

304
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,004
Then we need snacks,
soda, chips, cookies, hot dogs...

305
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,273
-[Mason] Video games!
-...hamburgers, s'mores.

306
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,341
[Mason] Video games.

307
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,877
Oh, and then, that's random.
We have video games on here.

308
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,312
-Okay.
-[Mason] Yay!

309
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,813
[Kris] Look it! Here's a tent!

310
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,149
[Scott] Okay, fine.
At least we're getting somewhere.

311
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,350
So, we need this.

312
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,986
-[Scott] What the heck is going on here?
-[Kris] We need lounge chairs.

313
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,455
-This is perfect.
-[Scott] That...Okay, now you're thinking...

314
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,624
-For s'mores.
-Grab four of those.

315
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,826
And then there's, like,
a little table for my coffee.

316
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,863
-[Scott] All right.
-Two-person air bed.

317
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,698
Marty, come on here
and try this mattress, please.

318
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,032
I got the air beds.

319
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,400
[Scott] Oh, that's luxurious.

320
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,569
This is a good cooler.
We're gonna need this.

321
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,538
-[Kris] Scott!
-[Scott] Hold on.

322
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,474
-We got that.
-[Mason] And it's a launching pad.

323
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,209
-[Kris laughing]
-[Scott] Lay down.

324
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,178
All right, should we go on to snacks?

325
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,381
-Hungry, fella?
-[Mason] Yeah!

326
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,183
[Scott] There you go.

for my own peace of mind.

when I'm sleeping.

378
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,458
[Kim] I called Joe, who owns the house.

379
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,795
And he had a really awful situation
where he was kidnapped.

380
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,597
He just, like, really calms me down

381
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,667
and lets me know, like,
it's okay to feel upset and anxious,

382
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,770
and just we have to work through it.

383
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:21,673
And just allow yourself the time
to cry it out for a minute,

384
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,243
and then just, like,
get yourself together.

-Are you feeling okay?
-[Kim] Yeah.

386
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,415

He, like, was like...

00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,719
He's like, "Seriously,
I totally understand how you feel.

and this is my safe place."

00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,759
I just feel like, with all those,
like, officials at the airport,

391
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,561
and they saw all these dumb girls,

392
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,197
and they were thinking we're gonna
just be wasted all night long

-and not care, and, like...
-Yeah.

394
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,735
Then that's the time that they'll come
and get us, when we're all wasted, or...

-You know what I mean?
-Mm-hm.

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,710
And then you take pictures,
and if they're not, like, perfect,

489
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,679
people just, like,
body-shame you and criticize you.

490
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,683
And, like, for people to just think
that's okay is so frustrating.

491
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,684
Ugh!

492
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,721
-Your body doesn't even look like that.
-I need to untag myself in everything.

493
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,290
I'm literally gonna go inside
and just start untagging.

494
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,028
{\an8}[upbeat music]

495
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,911
[Stephanie] Kimberly,
do you want to come Jet Ski with us?

496
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,513
-[Kim] No.
-[Stephanie] You're sure?

497
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,649
I can't have fun after seeing those pics.

498
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,184
Like, uh, it's just wild.

499
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,054
Because, like, there's other pics
where I look so good,

500
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,689
and it's from a different angle.

501
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,224
It's, like, literally giving me,

502
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,925
like, body dysmorphia.

503
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,494
I'm getting crazy.

504
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,330
[Stephanie] If the pictures are flawless,
they would still say something.

505
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,466
[Kim] And I think
people think I'm so confident

506
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,269
and I'm so secure,
and I'm so this, and I'm not!

507
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,239
Like, I'm so insecure.
I just can't take it.

508
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,109
This is so frustrating.
I just came to chill out

509
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,011
and not worry about anything.

510
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,579
And it's just been, like...

511
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,848
Sorry, but, like, the worst trip for me.

512
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,184
Why did I subject myself to come here?

513
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:44,322
-Next time, you won't be invited.
-I won't. I won't.

514
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,991
[Stephanie] Don't search that stuff.

515
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:51,196
Oh, I'm just looking at my feed.
I'm not searching. I'm not trying.

516
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,965
[women laughing]

517
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,968
I seriously think
you should just like it, like, "LOL."

518
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:57,969
[woman] I am not trying...

519
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,404
-[woman 2] Yes!
-[woman 3] Oh, my God!

520
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,240
-Okay, I liked it and I'll comment.
-[woman] Yes. Comment.

521
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,310
Just be like, "LOL," like,
"I don't care. It's hilarious."

522
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,746
[Kim] Do I say LOL with a cry face?

523
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,314
[Stephanie] Yes,
like you're in on the joke.

524
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,750
You don't care
that they made you look like that.

525
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,653
-[Stephanie] Just write, "LOL."
-I just wrote, "Gorg."

526
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,887
[laughter]

527
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,156
[upbeat music]

What do you got, P?

529
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,743
[Scott] Wow. You're really
an outdoorsman, huh?

530
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,312
Hey, Scotty!

531
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,381
Let the camping trip begin!

532
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:46,184
-Are you drinking?
-Uh, is this a camping trip?

533
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,987
Yeah, you drink, like, hot chocolate,
not vodka on the rocks.

534
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,989
Vodka on the rocks is
the way I go camping.

535
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,190
This ain't Saint-Tropez, lady.

536
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,391
[Kris] Ooh.

537
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,227
-[kids babbling]
-[Kris] So, are you ready?

538
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,728
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

539
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,430
[Scott] I'm not the biggest camper,
but I think

540
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,233
-I'm ready to get down and dirty.
-Do you love the tents my boys set up?

541
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,068
{\an8}Yeah. I thought
you were gonna set them up.

542
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,836
{\an8}I set mine up myself.

543
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,671
-It may not be as stable.
-[Kris] You set your own tent up?

544
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:07,706
Yeah.

545
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,976
Okay. So, these are our sleeping bags,
right?

546
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,514
And we had some pillows.
Oh, there they are.

547
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,515
[kids babbling]

548
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,483
Do we have any fur throws?

549
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,118
[suspenseful music playing]

550
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,855
You've got my 100% down sleeping bag
in there, don't you?

551
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,259
And my cashmere blanket.

552
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,630
-You're really roughing it.
-[Kris] Well, I go glamping.

553
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,503
Can someone bring me another cocktail?

554
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,438
{\an8}Guys, can we chill out?

555
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,606
{\an8}-[Mason] No.
-[kids babbling]

556
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,543
And then we can set this foot spa up.

557
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,679
-[Mason] I want to suck your blood.
-And do we have any portable heaters?

558
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,648
-Whoa.
-[Reign laughs]

559
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,784
We have a chef coming to make us dinner.

560
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,120
I thought this was the one-time
we were gonna rough it.

561
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,223
We are roughing it.
We're sleeping outside.

562
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,927
I've been camping plenty of times
the rugged way

563
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:05,330
and if you can do it the other way,
why not?

564
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,033
[Kris] And he wanted to rub
two sticks together, basically.

565
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,469
Scott couldn't rub
two dicks together if he tried to.

566
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,470
Like, come on.

567
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:13,972
Mase.

568
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,909
Let's do it ourselves
instead of Lovey hiring chefs.

569
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:18,810
[Mason] Yeah.

570
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,247
Let's get these wieners right.

571
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,151
[Kris] I just finished my hamburger.

572
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,118
What are you doing?

573
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,020
-[Mason] Making hot sausages.
-[Scott] I'm cooking that dog.

574
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,057
-[Mason] Making wieners.
-Oh, okay.

575
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,893
-[Kris] We could do some-mores on here.
-[Mason] S'mores.

576
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,862
Camping is some-mores.

-"Some-mores"?
-Some-mores, that's about it.

578
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,200
-Just some-mores.
-S'mores.

579
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,335
S'mores.

-Like...

-S'mores.
-S'mores.

-Mm-hm.
-Okay.

-Oh, my. Look at this monstrosity.

-Are you ready for this?
-Yeah.

Are you sure?

586
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,717
Are you sure?

587
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,885
Because this looks ridiculous!

588
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,721
Mm-mm.

everyone to raise their glasses.

Oh, saved by the bell.

-Hey, Mom.
-Hey. What are you doing?

607
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:16,995
<i>We're having the best time.
I threw up last night four times in my bed</i>

608
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,931
<i>and slept in it
because I could not get up.</i>

609
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,734
-That's gross.
-[Kourtney] <i>Are you guys having fun?</i>

610
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,670
We are. We just had a barbecue.

611

[Kourtney] <i>Oh, fun. Are you guys
gonna be up all night?</i>

612
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,309
Who knows? We're just wild.

613
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,945
We just hope
that we don't throw up in our beds.

614
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,781
-[Kourtney] <i>Yeah. You better be careful.</i>
-[Kris laughs]

615
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,184
I think we're gonna go to bed soon,
to be honest.

616
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,151
[Kourtney] <i>Okay.</i>

617
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,220
-We're almost done.
-<i>Is Scott gonna sleep there?</i>

618
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,225
I think so, yeah.

619
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,928
[Kourtney] <i>Thanks for hanging out
while we're here.</i>

620
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,530
-<i>All right, I love you guys.</i>
-Love you. Bye.

621
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,500
How is it she's allowed
to throw up in bed,

622
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,936
and I, like, have to go to rehab
if I do something like that?

623
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:01,306
You know, the last thing I want to do
is really hear exactly what Kourt's doing

624
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,974
on this Mexican getaway.

625
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,644
Obviously, Kourtney having a good time
makes me happy.

626
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,849
Of course, in the back of my heart
and mind, I get a little jealous

627
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,786
because I think that, "I wish we
could have had some of those type of times

628
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:15,954
when we were together."

629
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,289
And now that we're not,
I want her to have fun,

630
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,893
but I want to be able to do my own thing
and not be occupied in what she's doing.

631
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,094
So, I'm just gonna walk away.

632
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,497
[Scott] I'm going to bed.

633
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,165
-[Kris] Why?
-[Scott] Good night.

634

{\an8}[lively music]

635
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,674
{\an8}I can't believe you guys danced all night.

636
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,946
No, we literally stayed up till,
like, 3:30.

637
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,917
I was like,
"I wish I could have a quesadilla."

638
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:49,254
And Sarah was like, "You can.
It's your birthday." Then I had one.

639
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:56,227
Imagine being totally sober, lying in bed,
hearing "Despacito" 35 times in a row.

640
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,564
-Yeah.
-And people breaking things, falling over.

641
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,399
I don't think people were breaking things.

642
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,502
We were just dancing,
having, like, a major dance party.

{\an8}-[Kourtney] <i>Yeah!</i>
-[Kim] <i>To the same song 35 times.</i>

644
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,375
{\an8}Yeah. The dance moves were wild.

I am leaving Mexico early
just because I have work to do,

648
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,954
so I was always planning on leaving
a day earlier than everyone else.

649
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,322
But I'm kind of relieved.

650
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,690
Sorry. I know it's your birthday,

00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,860
but I'm sure you're relieved
to have a "funner" day without me.

652
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,095
I... Is funner a word?

653
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:32,630
More fun.

654
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,900
[Kourtney] I'm shocked
that you even came in the first place,

655
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,702
so you were a good sport.

656
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,270
[upbeat music]

657
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,473
[Kim] <i>Cute.</i>

658
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,646
[Jen] Kim, what did I say? What did I say?

659
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,082
-Jen!
-[laughs]

660
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,853
I don't know how I feel about this.

661
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,157
I'm gonna, I'm gonna filter it,
so it just looks cooler and not so basic.

662
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,325
[Kim] Cute.

663
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,728
<i>-Des... Desperados.
-Desperados.</i>

664
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:07,899
I don't mind the picture and stuff,
but I have such anxiety...

665
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,402
just going places.

666
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:15,506
I think it's, like, becoming a condition,
because it's not like I...

667
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,742
I get it. Like, I'm in the spotlight.

668
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,311
People... If you go out in public,
people can take pics.

669
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,080
It's not that annoying part.

670
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:26,918
It's just that I don't want it
to be said that, "Kim was here.

671
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,654
Kim went to this, you know,
restaurant or Kim went here."

672
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,724
I just don't want to be
in the mix the way that I used to.

673
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,027
How desperate I was, like, going
to every restaurant every night,

674
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,929
-like, only wanting to be seen.
-[woman laughing]

675
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,665
Knowing that all the <i>TMZ</i> cameras
were there.

676
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,167
So, I'd, like, run, flock to those places.

677
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,970
-I would be like, "Oh, Katsuya."
-[indistinct dialogue]

678
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,539
I know there's paparazzi here.
"Oh, I got my makeup done

679
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,874
I'm going out tonight.""

680
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,745
-I was, like, so hungry for that.
-[indistinct dialogue]

681
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,114
And now even Kanye's like,
"Let's go out to dinner."

682
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,782
And I'm like, "I can't. I can't."

683
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,652
Like, I don't... I just...
I can't enjoy myself.

684
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,354
And I feel like
I've got to get out of my shell.

685
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,325
[Kim] But I don't want to.
I like living this more chill life.

686
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,527
[tense music playing]

687
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,666
[Jen] Yeah, but don't you feel,
like, you earned this chill life?

688
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,701
{\an8}For years, you guys have, like,

689
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,504
{\an8}people just constantly expecting
so much from you.

690
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,673
Just, like, wanting,
like, so much from you.

691
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,975
I don't know how you've dealt with it.
Like, it's a lot.

692
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,612
It kind of makes you be,
like, socially, like, awkward.

693
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,181
Like, it makes you,
like, have social anxiety.

694
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,217
I've become socially awkward for sure.

695
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:37,155
I am so afraid of everything.

696
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,725
You know, dealing with anxiety, pressure,

697
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,928
you know, things that I've never
really dealt with before.

698
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:48,967
And I really am not as, like,
open and out there as I used to be.

699
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:54,205
I just don't like to be in the mix,
and that's just so not like me.

700
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,140
But maybe it's good.

701
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,915
{\an8}[Jonathan] Why are you sitting
like you're on a slide?

702
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,517
Because these jeans don't fit me.

703
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:07,885
-Are you serious?
-And I can hardly sit.

704
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,221
You walk around the house
with jeans that don't fit you?

705
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,589
I'm trying to break them in.

706
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,291
-Oh, cause I didn't understand...
-I want to fit them.

707
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,259
...why you were sitting like
you were gonna, like, slide down.

708
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,928
-[Jonathan] Like an amusement park.
-[Kim] I want to fit them.

709
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:17,829
[Kim chuckles]

710
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,697
{\an8}Tell me about Mexico.
What was going on there?

711
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:20,832
{\an8}You guys had, like, a free-for-all.

712
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,368
{\an8}-That was like a sorority rush.
-It was a sorority.

713
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,269
-What the hell possessed you...
-Honestly, I...

714
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,006
-...to go to a trip like that?
-I don't know.

715
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,541
I was waiting for <i>piñatas</i>
to come out, I'm not kidding.

716
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,143
-Like, what the hell was going on there?
-Oh, there was.

717
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,244
There was a <i>piñata</i>?

718
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,880
There was, like, crazy <i>piñatas</i>.

719
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,915
It was a [bleep] show.

720
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,650
With, like, dildos in them.

721
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,387
When you...when you'd hit it,
they would come out. It was crazy.

722
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,589
But this is not an engagement party.
I don't understand.

723
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:48,960
It was like a bachelorette party,
a sorority party, a...

724
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,496
-Sweet 16.
-...hazing party, a sweet 16,

725
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,298
-...a quinceañera all in one.
-[Jonathan] What the... Right. Oh.

726
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,434
I saw the snaps
and that trip looked insane.

727
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,502
Yeah.

728
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,237
I don't want to bring up
the elephant in the room.

729
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,238
[Jonathan chuckles]

730
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,407
Not you.
You're not the elephant in the room.

731
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,176
-But what the hell happened with those...
-I am.

732
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,545
-That's me.
-What was wrong with those pictures?

733
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,514
First of all, I've seen you on the bea...

734
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,949
I've been on the beach with you,
like, a thousand times.

735
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:15,453
-I know your body doesn't look like that.
-I always have cellulite on my thigh,

736
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,755
on my one thigh,
and I always, like, cover it.

737
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,090
No, I know that you have cellulite,

738
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,825
but it doesn't look like it looked
in those pics.

739
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,094
That was like "Rocky Mountain High."

740
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,396
I swear to God,
it was like, I was like, "What is..."

741
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,666
'Cause that's not your ass. I saw...
I think I saw Abe Lincoln on your ass.

742
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,402
-I don't know what was going on.
-It literally didn't make sense.

743
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,337
I was so upset. 'Cause I was like...

744
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,807
"That's just not what I look like."

745
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,842
[tense music]

746
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:43,915
It can really, like, hurt your soul
if you hear enough bad things about you.

747
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,016
-Even if you know...
-People are bullies.

748
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,184
...you don't look like that.

749
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,020
It could just be like,
"Oh, wait a minute, do I?"

750
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,955
And, like, the last thing I want is

751
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,025
to have, like, a complex
because people were so nasty.

752
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,760
And they're so excited to be nasty

753
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,028
-so fast.
-That's what it is.

754
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,098
-They're so excited to bring you down.
-They're waiting for anything bad.

755
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,366
[Jonathan] I think you should,
like, forget about it.

756
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,169
I know you tend to get into, like,
a different mood

757
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,004
and, like, start thinking about it.

758
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,106
-[Kim] Yeah.
-But, like, everybody loves you.

759
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,240
-You look amazing.
-It's just Kanye's not going

760
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,274
to the Met this year,

761
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:14,278
just 'cause he just is
loving chilling out and taking time off.

762
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,814
[Kim] And so I feel like,
"Ugh, should I just chill out, too?

763
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,416
Should I just not go?" Like...

764
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,185
Well, and don't make that decision
based on these pics for you.

765
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,689
Not everybody's working together to, like,
take you down, you know what I mean?

766
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,858
So you need to, like,
just pick your head back up.

767
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,860
[Jonathan]
I think you should go to the Met.

768
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,564
[Kim] The theme is just so over the top.
Like, avant-garde, Comme des Garçons.

769
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,299
And they're just, like, so...

770
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,671
Big. And then it'll be like,
"She's hiding under all that stuff."

771
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:46,911
You become insecure once you start
seeing so many bad things about you.

772
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:51,983
It's like do I even want to put myself
in a situation like going to the Met Ball?

773
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:55,052
Feeling insecure and wondering, like,
"Am I gonna look skinny?"

774
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,855
You know? "Are they gonna like my dress?
What's going on?"

775
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,490
Like, you know, I don't know.

776
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,193
I just don't know
if I want to be put in that position.

777
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,228
[Jonathan] Stop worrying about
what everybody thinks.

778
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,463
It's so crazy.

779
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,534
[upbeat music]

780
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:18,643
{\an8}I wonder where Scott ever put the chair
I got him for Christmas.

781
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,545
-Hi.
-Hi.

782
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,648
-I know, right? How was Mexico?
-This is cool.

783
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,950
Isn't that beautiful?
There's three different covers.

784
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,686
[Kourtney] It was...

785
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:33,357
really, really
the best four days of my life.

786
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:37,595
-Yeah? You had fun?
-Yeah, we really had the best time ever.

787
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:42,433
I don't think you should actually
Instagram or put on social media

788
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,670
that you got so sick that you threw up,
and then went to sleep in it.

789
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,139
-[Kourtney] Why? It was so funny.
-It's not funny.

790
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,674
-[Kourtney] Yes, it is.
-No, it's not.

791
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,145
I feel like, on social media lately,
everyone takes themselves so seriously.

792
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,047
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And I'm over it.

793
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,182
-Well, I'm glad you had fun.
-How was the...

794
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:01,485
-How was the camping day?
-Camping was good.

795
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,255
-I think the kids had fun.
-[Kourtney] How was Scott?

796
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,324
[Kris] I think that he was jealous

797
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,594
because you were having fun,
spending time with other people.

798
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,430
-[Kourtney] Well, that's really not fair.
-[tense music playing]

799
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:16,601
It's just like I can't even live my life.
I can't even go anywhere.

800
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:22,506
{\an8}[Kourtney] He needs to get a [bleep] life
and leave me alone.

801
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:27,378
And he... all he does is try
to make everybody else feel bad for him.

802
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:31,849
And to make... try to make me look
like the bad guy in the situation,

803
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,818
when clearly I'm not,

804
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,288
from, you know,
ten years of this going on.

805
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,157
Wouldn't you be sad
if he truly left you alone?

806
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:44,128
You always want what you can't have,
and when somebody's right there

807
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:48,299
-giving you their heart on a platter...
-He's not. He's not though.

808
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,937
-If he was, that was one thing. He's not.
-[Kris] That's not his story.

809
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:57,308
No, Mom, that's what he makes it seem
to you, to Kim,...

810
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,878
-He does.
-...to Khloé to the world, to everybody.

811
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,649
He sits there and grovels
and feels bad for himself.

812
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:09,120
So, if that was his truth,
why can't he get it together?

813
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,526
I have to handle it
when he's out photographed, you know...

814
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,561
-Yeah.
-...with a different hooker every day.

815
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,365
He's clearly doing his own thing.

816
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,467
Brittni told me yesterday about, like,

817
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,436
five different girls
that he's hooking up with.

818
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,238
-[Kris] What?
-Yeah.

819
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,840
He tricks all of you guys
to think he's do...

820
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,143
-[Kris] Wow.
-...he's sitting at home like a saint,

821
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,611
praying to the Bible.

822
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:38,149
Well, then I think you guys should just
agree to have a different relationship

823
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,217
and both of you move on.

824
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,119
So I think it's actually a good idea

825
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,855
that you don't take
any more family trips right away,

826
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:50,761
because he seems to hold on
to those trips as a way of...

827
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:54,498
Or he thinks you're, perhaps,
gonna get back together with him.

828
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,435
-And he does it every single time.
-But the other thing is, like, I'm like,

829
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,339
"Is he doing the trip
so that most guys in the world,

830
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:02,773
like, think that we're together?"

831
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,843
-[Kris] Maybe.
-'Cause, honestly, like...

832
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,878
-Maybe that's an insurance policy.
-...a lot of people think so.

833
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:12,216
[Kris] Well, I think you got
to figure it out and make it work for you.

834
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,085
And you want to go out and be single.

835
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:18,055
Then, on the other hand, you got to go out
and be single if he's never gonna change.

836
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:22,293
He's showing that he's never gonna change.
Why can't he get his life together?

837
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,696
Oh, man.

838
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:30,835
I feel like, for so many years,
I've been worried about,

839
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:34,105
like, my actions setting off Scott,

840
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:37,708
which I think is not a healthy way
to live my life.

841
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,779
Because at the end of the day, like,
he is doing what he wants

842
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:45,516
and he's not concerned about, you know,
how it might make me feel.

843
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,652
[Kourtney] I'm sick of being, like,
just the stable one who, like,

844
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,222
{\an8}I'm not gonna go do anything crazy.

845
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:55,226
{\an8}I think it just feels good
to not have to worry about...

846
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,731
like, anyone else and just do
whatever I want and live my life.

847
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,536
{\an8}-[Khloé] <i>On the next episode...</i>
-Cheers to that.

848
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,071
{\an8}[Kris] I love you.

849
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,406
{\an8}[Khloé] Oh, this is so fun!

850
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,708
{\an8}-We're having fun.
-[Kris] I'm drinking a lot.

851
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:11,776
{\an8}[Kris laughs]

852
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,645
{\an8}Kourt has been out
on the dating scene recently.

853
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,614
{\an8}-Did you wash your face today?
-No.

854
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,682
{\an8}[Khloé] The walk of shame right there!

855
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,752
{\an8}[Kim] <i>I think just knowing
that all eyes are on you,</i>

856
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:25,256
{\an8}<i>when you're walking up those stairs
is really intimidating.</i>

857
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,325
{\an8}[Kim] Oh, my God,
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
