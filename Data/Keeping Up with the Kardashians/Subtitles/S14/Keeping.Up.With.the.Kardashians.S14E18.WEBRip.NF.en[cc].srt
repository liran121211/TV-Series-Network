Keeping Up with the Kardashians<i>...</i>

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,775
{\an8}[Khloé] Alexa!

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,778
{\an8}-I'm pregnant.
-Oh, my God.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,979
{\an8}[Khloé] I think I'm in a state of shock.

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,582
{\an8}I almost can't believe it.
But a good shock.

6
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,150
{\an8}We have an announcement.

7
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,752
{\an8}KoKo, want to throw the hammer down?

8
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,520
{\an8}We're having a baby!

9
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,089
{\an8}-What? Oh, my God.
-[all exclaiming]

10
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,557
{\an8}No way!

11
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:25,959
{\an8}[Khloé] Yes, we are.

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,462
{\an8}-Khloé! I am so happy for you!
-No wonder you gained a few pounds!

13
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,064
{\an8}Oh, my God!

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,606
{\an8}[Kim] I am so tired.
I cannot get up this early.

15
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:40,707
How early?

16
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,076
Saint was up at, like, 4:30.

17
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,311
What the hell was he doing at 4:30?

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,317
Crying and saying, "Baba, baba.
Downstairs. Go get."

19
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,653
[Khloé] Aw, he's so cute though.

20
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,724
So you know we're having the baby
in Cleveland.

21
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,760
Yeah. How is that gonna happen?
What if you're, like...

22
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,096
-I have my doctor.
-What?

23
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,898
She's flying to Cleveland
to deliver the baby.

24
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,332
What if it's an emergency

25
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,501
-and something happens?
-No, stop saying these things.

26
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,103
You have to be prepared.

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,237
[sighs]
Don't scare me.

28
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,305
I don't have another option.

29
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,441
And then are you gonna,
like, eat your placenta?

30
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,812
I'm gonna eat it in pills.

31
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,513
Yeah, so then,
you need the placenta person

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,782
-to come while it's still fresh.
-That's not just, like, a...

33
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,551
a thing at the hospital?

34
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,554
No. You need to find a placenta company.

35
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,324
And then, like, they knock on the door
when you're, like, just giving birth,

36
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,226
and they're like,
"The placenta pickup's here."

37
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,863
How do I know
that they're giving me back my placenta?

38
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,831
You don't.

39
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,700
But, like, with Saint,
my placenta was double the size.

40
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,435
It was really oddly big.

41
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:45,405
-Ew.
-And so, she gave me two jars.

42
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,575
What are your jars of?

43
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,878
Like purple pills, and it's, like,
you pick a grape flavor or whatever.

44
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,113
No, you're lying now.

45
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,414
Yeah, I swear.

46
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,415
-No.
-Yeah.

47
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,816
Grape-flavored what? Placenta?

48
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,384
Yeah.

49
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,053
What?

50
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,121
[Kim] Mm-hmm.

51
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,189
Ew.

{\an8}[phone ringing]

54
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,183
{\an8}[Kim] Hey.

55
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,321
{\an8}Yeah, I said, I... Well, I started off
saying that this...

56
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,423
{\an8}"I love you a lot like a sister,

57
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,260
{\an8}and this conversation's really hard
for me to have,

58
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,096
but, you know, I just think that

59
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,399
you've outgrown your position here."

[somber music]

61
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,304
She's like, "I totally get it,
and I totally respect you,

62
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,505
and you've taught me everything,

63
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,607
and I'm so grateful I've been with you
for five years."

64
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,414
{\an8}My assistant Stephanie and I
have decided to part ways.

65
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,185
{\an8}She wanted a different role,
and I was moving in a different direction,

66
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,655
{\an8}so I felt like, you know, for both of us,
it just wasn't the right fit anymore.

67
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,057
She's, like,
really been there for me, you know?

68
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,293
And so, I said, "I love you so much."

69
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,894
And I was like,
"Maybe this is good too, like,

70
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,330
push you to figure out
what you want to do."

71
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:21,935
It was, like... It ended, like, really well.
Like, she knew that she needed this time,

72
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,037
and she knew it, like, wasn't working.

73
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,805
Totally. Yeah.

74
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,440
All right.

75
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,775
Love you.

We're getting tips
that Khloé is pregnant as well.

{\an8}<i>He just said,
"We're hearing buzz about it."</i>

88
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,675
[Khloé] So far,
TMZ has not published the article,

89
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,510
but I'm just mad because

90
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,847
there's so many risks involved
when you're newly pregnant.

91
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,549
And if the doctor's telling me

92
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,951
not to announce anything
until a specific time,

93
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,421
I am respecting that, and I just hate
that everyone is prying and so nosy.

94
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,990
It's super frustrating.

95
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,860
[Tracy] <i>If it gets to the point where
they're definitely gonna do something,</i>

96
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,462
-<i>I'll let you know.</i>
-Okay.

97
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,530
<i>But I think for now,
they're just beginning</i>

98
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,698
<i>to sort of hear about it.</i>

99
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,101
<i>And so, I'm sure
they're gonna start poking around.</i>

100
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,871
At the moment, I've only told
my immediate family and friends,

101
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,973
and that's what I'm gonna
keep it to right now.

102
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,210
Can't believe all these rumors...
Like, where do they come from?

103
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,177
And, like...

104
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,581
I just don't understand
how everything happens.

105
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,882
Do you?

106
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,484
Yeah, I think people just talk.

107
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,220
[sighs]
I only have a few hours

108
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,688
to finish this puzzle.

109
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,990
I do not like puzzles like this.
This is a really hard one.

110
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,792
-Yeah, it's like...
-This is, like, for 90-year-olds.

111
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,328
Like, this is what you do
when you're really old.

112
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,433
<i>Is this, like, a rabbit or a cheetah?</i>

113
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,534
[North] <i>Cheetah.</i>

114
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,835
<i>Cheetah. Yes!</i>

115
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:09,842
{\an8}I watch Kim Kardashian West's
<i>The Look Book</i>, and I text Kim.

116
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,778
I go, "You got to watch this."

117
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,714
It was so good. Going through
Kim's whole style evolution...

118
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,149
Yeah, I had no idea they were doing that.

119
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,917
-It was really cute.
-I don't watch TV.

120
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,452
Like, no one cares.

121
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,789
You don't get an award
because you watch less TV.

122
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,591
I do, 'cause I'm winning in life.

123
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,661
-You got to, like, stay relevant.
-[Khloé] You got to stay relevant.

124
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,564
[Kourtney] Um, so I've been thinking
about freezing my eggs.

125
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,700
Are you serious? You want another kid?

126
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,736
What if I do though?
I don't know what I want.

127
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,905
[Kourtney] What if I want a kid
in the next ten years?

128
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,975
Wouldn't you rather have the insurance,
like, sitting... like, sitting there?

129
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,779
Well, if you have a kid
when you're pushing 50, then...

130
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,614
Janet Jackson just did it.

131
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,483
Yeah, but...

132
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,718
[Kim] Who would you have a kid with?

133
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,152
-I don't know.
-[Khloé] She does.

134
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,787
-Look at that smile.
-No, I don't.

135
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,056
Wouldn't you just say,
"Hey, Scott, give me your sperm,"

136
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,126
and they take it in a turkey baster,
and they stick it up you and squishy?

137
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,595
[Kourtney]
I don't need a baby to have a baby.

138
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,963
I have three kids.

139
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,101
I'm saying if I am, like, in love,
and the person wants to have a kid,

140
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,570
-and...
-So you're thinking about a younger guy?

141
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,705
What are you talking about?

142
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:13,840
-[Khloé] I'm just trying to see...
-I get it.

143
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:14,841
...if I can get it out of you.

144
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,609
If I wanted to have it with...

145
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,478
with my situation right this second,

146
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,614
I would take out my IUD,
and I would get to work.

147
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,883
[grunts, whispers]
Get to work.

148
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,652
But I don't need...
That's... Right now, I'm good.

149
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,321
-Good. Got it. Got it.
-[Kourtney] Okay.

150
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,157
This is if you're in love
and want to fulfill

151
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,725
the man's dream of a baby.

152
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,093
-Yup.
-[Kim] Mm-hmm.

153
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,030
What if I want my love
to come into the world?

00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,633
Is that gross to you?

156
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,935

00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,934
-He did?
-Mm-hmm.

168
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,602
I don't know. I'm feeling like,

169
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,906
I wanted to dye my hair blond
my entire life.

170
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,073
What?

171
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,378
[Kris] People have always thought
that Kim and I look a lot alike,

172
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,814
and that's always worked out
really well for me

173
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,383
because I get a lot of my inspiration

174
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,785
from some of the things
that Kim does and wears.

175
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,422
And since the blonde looks so good on her,

176
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,492
I don't know, maybe I can pull it off.

177
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,693
But it would have to be done.

178
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,930
-'Cause I remember he did yours so gentle.
-This took, like, 15 hours.

179
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,332
-But look how long your hair is.
-And your hair is never the same.

180
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,834
Why? What happens when you're blonde?

181
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,902
It's like gummy.

182
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,137
Gummy?

183
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,140
It's like you can feel it,
like, elasticky.

184
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,175
Wow, I had no idea.

185
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,977
But then it looks cute
when your roots grow in,

186
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,078
but your roots are white,

187
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,614
-so they're not gonna be, you know, dark.
-[laughs]

188
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,582
You're right.

189
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,385
[upbeat music]

190
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,592
{\an8}-[Kourtney] Khlo?
-[Khloé] Yeah?

191
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,160
Hi. How are you?

192
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,728
Oh, how's your penis?

193
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,597
How's your penis?

194
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,332
I don't feel well.

195
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,200
Literally, I, like, can't walk.

196
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,568
[Khloé] I told Tristan. He was like,

197
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,304
"You haven't gone anywhere with me
in the last two weeks."

198
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,139
And I was like, "I'm so sorry."

199
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,442
When you did your progesterone,

200
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,178
did anything ever happen
to, like, the outside of you?

201
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,880
[Kim] Like what?

202
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,749
Like, it's so gross.

203
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,051
I was, like,
thought I was, like, spotting,

204
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,220
and I was like, "Okay, that's so weird."

205
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,488
And then the doctor was like,
"Where are you..."

206
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,691
Like, "How much are you spotting?"
I was like, "Not a lot." It's so weird.

207
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,961
So, like, I realized
it wasn't from the inside.

208
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,131
The outside is burned so bad
that it's bleeding.

209
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,367
[tense music]

210
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,371
[Khloé] My doctor realized that I have
really low levels of progesterone,

211
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,241
so I have to take progesterone supplements
two to three times a day,

212
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,143
and it is torture.

213
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,745
[Kourtney] Why are you even doing this?

214
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,281
[Khloé]
Or else the baby is gonna not be here.

215
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,750
-[Kourtney] Why? What...
-[Khloé] Your body naturally produces

216
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,385
progesterone. If you don't...

217
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,820
-My body after... Yeah.
-[Kourtney] And yours doesn't?

218
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,557
And after you conceive,

219
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,192
there's, I guess, a cyst
that's, like, filled with progesterone.

220
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,761
It normally pops, she says.

221
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,630
And that keeps the sac in place.

222
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,732
And if not, that's how you miscarry.

223
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,701
So she said, for sure,
I would have miscarried.

224
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,871
Can you text your doctor right now
and see if you can get the shots?

225
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,905
[Khloé] It's... Yeah.

226
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,141
-They're pills you put inside your vagina.
-Like a suppository thing?

227
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,876
-Yeah.
-[Kim] Yeah. I did that for a while,

228
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,344
and then I was like,
"I can't [bleep] do this."

229
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,581
It comes out like clumpy cottage cheese.

230
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,648
Yeah.

231
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,584
-So, like, I'd have to, like, time it out.
-[Khloé] No, no.

232
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,887
Like, put it in at night,
or, like, have sex.

233
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:48,988
Then put it in.

234
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,157
Can't have sex in the morning. It's, like...

235
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,225
No, but I have to put it
in 3:00 in the morning

236
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,126
and 3:00 at night

237
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,162
'cause my progesterone is so low.

238
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,230
[Khloé] I have to wake up and put it in.

239
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:02,001
I have to, like, literally lay my legs up,
and I have to wait an hour.

240
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,302
This is not fun.

241
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,571
Like, three more weeks of this.

242
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,139
[sighs deeply]

243
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,842
I just feel sick every night,
just feel gross.

244
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,446
But now, like,
my [bleep] vagina hurts like crazy.

245
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,348
I physically, like, can barely walk.

246
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,984
[tense music continues]

247
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,989
[upbeat music]

248
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,696
-After you.
-[Kourtney] Thank you.

249
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:36,302
I'm meeting with Dr. Huang to get
some information about freezing my eggs.

250
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:42,108
I just want to be as educated as I can
about what the process is

251
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:46,445
because I just need to really be sure
if it's something that I want to do.

252
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,481
[Dr. Huang] All right,
let's go over a couple of things.

253
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,251
{\an8}So, these are eggs, okay?
So you've seen this before.

254
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,987
{\an8}So... But it helps us understand
egg quality and egg quantity,

255
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,422
and the difference between the two.

256
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,157
The orange ones are the good ones, okay?

257
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,327
So, not all of a woman's eggs
are always good, okay?

258
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,830
And our goal is to do everything we can
to get these eggs in the freezer.

259
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,601
Because if this is you as a 38-year-old,
watch what happens when you're 39.

260
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,371
Watch what happens when you're 40... 42... 43.

261
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,839
-Mm-hmm.
-See how things are changing?

262
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,775
-Mm-hmm.
-All right, so as you get older,

263
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,678
it's gonna be harder and harder
to find a good one, okay?

264
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,480
Today, if you have
these six or seven eggs,

265
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,382
I'm trying to get these in the freezer.

266
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:27,219
That way, even as you get older,
you'll always have these to fall back on.

267
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,322
To do this, we're gonna start you on shots
for about 8 to 12 days.

268
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,993
These are FSH shots.

269
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,462
Does it make you fat? Does it...

270
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,596
You do get a little bit bloated.

271
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,165
You won't look bloated,
but you'll feel bloated.

272
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,600
[Kourtney]
After hearing about all the steps involved

273
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,737
in just putting all the hormones
in my body

274
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,773
and giving myself shots every day.

275
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,675
Look, I just really have
to think about it.

276
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,379
Is there a way to do it natural,

277
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,114
or, like, a less kind of,

278
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,116
-like, estrogen or is there...
-Yeah. Absolutely.

279
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,252
The most natural way to do this
is to do no medications.

280
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,721
-Okay?
-Okay.

281
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,255
And you're gonna make one egg a month.

282
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,725
Remember, I want to get
10 to 12 to 15 eggs in the freezer.

283
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,860
How long is it gonna take me
to get 10 to 15?

284
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,262
It's gonna take me every month
for the next 10 to 12 months.

285
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,098
-Yeah.
-So, it's not very efficient.

286
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,867
So instead, my hope was that
we can do it once and get,

287
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,969
you know, six to eight eggs, okay?

288
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,172
-Can they last forever?
-We don't know if they can last forever,

289
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,208
-but we know they can last a while, okay?
-Okay.

290
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,212

291
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,385

294
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,761
Hey, Kim.

295
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,664
What is going on?

296
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,768
Do you like it?

297
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,070
-Oh, wow.
-I think it looks really great.

298
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,371
Are you sure?

299
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,739
Yeah.

300
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,609
I've never worn a wig like this before.

301
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,411
[Kris] I've really wanted
to go blonde for so long,

302
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,782
but the process
is really grueling on your hair,

303
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,717
that I thought I would try a wig first.

304
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:11,257
It takes, like, a really strong woman
to pull off this, like, icy blonde.

305
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,691
-It does?
-Yeah.

306
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,661
Have you ever seen the movie
<i>The Devil Wears Prada?</i>

307
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,865
-Yes. I love that movie.
-You kind of look like Miranda Priestly.

308
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,802
-Stop. Really?
-Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,171
-Hmm.
-Don't you think?

310
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,240
I could see it a little bit.

311
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,311
[Kris] Miranda Priestly
represents this amazing chicness,

312
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,413
and a New York attitude,

313
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,416
and now I'm looking in the mirror,
and Kim is right.

314
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,186
I mean, we are the same person.

315
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,354
I could get used to this.

316
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,590
-Welcome to the club.
-[Kris laughs]

317
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,091
It's kind of a good club.

318
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,029
Have you ever seen
the Instagram Dr. Pimple Popper?

319
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,264
Dr. Pimple Popper?

320
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:56,035
Every single post
is about, like, squeezing something.

321
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,139
But it's a doctor, or it's, like,
her name, Dr. Pimple Popper.

-Now?

-I might have one.
-No, Mom, you're fine.

-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

-Yes, Mom.

[Dr. Aliabadi] How are you?

332
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,261
-How are you? Good.
-Good. Come in.

333
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,167
The outside of my vagina...

334
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,602
[Dr. Aliabadi] Oh, let's do a culture.

335
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,238
Yeah, and will you just,
not look at, or whatever,

336
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,240
but it's just, like,
the inside feels fine,

337
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,141
it's the outside
that's still kind of, like...

338
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,376
-Raw?
-Yeah.

339
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,013
{\an8}My doctor brought me in
because I'm so uncomfortable.

340
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,649
You just want to, like, lay
with, like, ice all over.

341
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,017
You're just like, "Oh, my God."

342
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,719
Your poor vagina.

343
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,053
-I know.
-[soft chuckle]

344
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,955
Is that from the progesterone?

345
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,924
[Dr. Aliabadi] It's from pregnancy.

346
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,959
-Perfect.
-Stress and pregnancy.

347
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,995
-It will resolve.
-[Khloé] I know.

348
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,130
-Welcome to pregnancy.
-Thank you.

349
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,499
-[laughs]
-Thank you very much.

350
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,036
So your progesterone level was perfect.

351
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,170
You did well.

352
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,539
It saved your pregnancy.

353
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,343
This is one example
why you don't announce early.

354
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,079
There's a lot of complications.
A lot of things could happen.

355
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,081
I could have had a potential to miscarry.

356
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,251
-Just this first part I see you so often.
-Okay.

357
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,185
I know I keep bringing you back,

358
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,021
-it's because of your progesterone.
-[Khloé] No, it's fine.

359
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,556
As soon as I get to my second trimester,

360
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,927
I will have such relief,
and that's all I'm waiting for.

361
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,629
All right, cutie.
I'll see you whenever you come back.

362
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,365
-[Khloé] Okay, thank you, bye.
-Bye.

363
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,935
{\an8}[upbeat music]

364
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,313
{\an8}I mean, is that bag cute,
or is it just sentimentally cute

365
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,948
{\an8}-'cause we both love it?
-[Kourtney] No, it's both.

366
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,549
I'm gonna take a photo.

367
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,017
[clicks tongue]

368
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,054
You have issues.

369
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,589
You have major issues.
[laughs]

370
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,124
I do.

371
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,626
[Kourtney chuckles]

372
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,828
Hi.

373
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,430
Why are you taking photos?

374
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,099
'Cause, you know, Kourtney, like,
sets everything up with a prop.

375
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,434
[Larsa] It's all OCD.

376
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,768
[Sarah] You're not hot at all?

377
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,170
Sweetheart, I stay hot.

378
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,771
-That's why I just keep it inside me.
-I, um...

379
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,007
went to Dr. Huang.

380
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,977
He said if you want to do it
the natural way

381
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,179
and not have to do
the shots and the estrogen,

382
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,880
they can take out one egg a month.

383
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,316
{\an8}-But you have to be put under still.
-You have to be put under.

384
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,418
{\an8}-Yeah, I've done it. Yeah.
-You've done it?

385
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,920
Oh, that's right, you said that.

386
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,188
-When did you...
-29 out,

387
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,522
and 20 mature enough to freeze.

388
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,693
'Cause I'm deciding on which guy
I want to be the father of my children.

389
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,463
I feel like if you had to choose,
like, out of a lab...

390
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,931
Oh, I'm not choosing from a lab.

391
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,567
-I have real prospects.
-[Sarah] Oh, okay.

392
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,535
[Larsa] Yes, thank you.

393
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,170
Hey.

394
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,405
It is poppin'!

395
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,841
{\an8}-Hi.
-Hi.

396
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:49,808
{\an8}[Kourtney] Scotty.

397
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,210
Hi.

398
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,211
Mwah.

399
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,512
[Sarah] You want some?

400
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,681
No, but I will have some rosé.

401
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,949
I didn't get to talk to you
about this today,

402
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,317
but everyone's always like,

403
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,285
"Oh, what time do you have
to wake up? Is it so early?"

404
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,621
I'm like, "No. Me and Kourtney
are on the best schedule.

405
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,124
She drops off kids, works out,

406
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,259
I work out in the morning,
and we start by noon."

407
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,293
-It's the best.
-[Sarah] Why don't you guys

408
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,262
-have a kid together?
-[laughs]

409
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,630
'Cause I'm not...

410
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,333
No, but I'm not desperate for a kid.

411
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,601
That's what you're not understanding.

412
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,237
I'm doing it if I'm in love

413
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,707
and I want to, like, bring that love
into the world in a human being.

414
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,708
Combo is key.

415
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,942
That's it.

416
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,011
Honey, we all know
the Kourtney shop doesn't close.

417
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,447
-[Larsa] No, it's open 24/7.
-[chortles]

418
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,015
-[Larsa chuckles]
-[Kourtney] But really,

419
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,384
I feel like I should just do it,
so I don't have to think,

420
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,354
"Oh, my God, is this for me?
Is this who I want to have kids with?"

421
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,890
Is this this? Is it that?
It's, like, putting too much pressure.

422
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,692
So, I'd rather just, like, do this
and I don't have to think about it.

423
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,795
I... I know why you're really doing it.

424
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,029
-Why?
-[Larsa] Why?

425
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,365
Tell me. I want to know your thought.

426
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,035
You're doing it
'cause you're dating someone younger

427
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:54,139
-and... and you want him to know...
-[Kourtney] Okay.

428
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,408
...that all the options are open
if he wants to have kids,

429
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,078
{\an8}-then you'll be able to have kids.
-Oh, my God. No.

430
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:02,114
Totally, but you're not sure
about him yet.

431
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,282
That's why you want to do it right now.

432
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,584
She's breaking it down so crazy right now,
but it's all true.

433
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,387
[Sarah] It's true, thank you.
It's so true.

434
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,790
No, but I feel like
I could just make it happen.

435
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,193
That's why I'm like,
"Do I even care to do this?"

436
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,428
[Sarah] Like, for me,
I'm so happy I did it.

437
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,197
-I don't regret doing it.
-Now?

438
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,432
I was so happy I did it
even while I was doing it.

439
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,366
I was like,
"Okay, I'm doing this for a reason.

440
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,768
I'm doing this for a reason."

441
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,803
Because I was so moody
when I was doing the shots.

442
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,140
I mean, like, I couldn't be around anyone.
I wanted to just punch everyone.

443
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,943
And then after, it made me depressed
for, like, two months.

444
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,911
[tense music]

445
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:36,215
Like, I just felt so... I did not
feel myself. I was super down after...

446
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,649
[Larsa] Because your hormones are...

447
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,619
Go, like, here, up to here,
and then they go all the way down

448
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,187
because they take all of it out.

449
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,389
Yeah, I would not want to do it
more than once, ever.

450
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,393
After hearing that the hormones
can really mess with you,

451
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,264
and it's, like, a very common thing,
that just, like, was alarming to me

452
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:56,468
because being, like, depressed, like,
who wants to go through that?

453
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,871
I mean, I understand why people
who actually are trying to get pregnant,

454
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,673
couples, why they, like,
get divorced over IVF.

455
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,076
Okay, well, I don't want to do it anymore.

456
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,082
[lively music]

457
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,189
{\an8}[Khloé] Crazy thing about Mom,
she copies everything I do.

458
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,025
Like, don't you find that
annoying as [bleep]?

459
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,562
I'm asking you a question
but you're not listening, are you?

460
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,098
[Kourtney]
"Don't you find that annoying as [bleep]?"

461
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,267
[laughter]

462
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,403
I can tell you're gonna be in a good mood
for nine months, aren't you?

463
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,405
[Khloé]
Mom, what the [bleep] are you doing?

464
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,875
Seriously, what the [bleep]?

465
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:38,744
[Kourtney] This is how you chill

466
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,812
-in your house?
-[Khloé] Yeah, what are you doing?

467
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,282
Please don't bore me with your questions.

468
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,783
[Khloé] What?

469
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,919
But what the [bleep] is going on
on your head?

470
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,922
Is that your real hair?

471
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,757
[Kris] Of course, darling.

472
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:56,662
And if you don't get the <i>Harry Potter</i> book
for the twins, you're toast.

473
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,729
-What?
-Who's the twins?

474
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,967
Oh, please move at a glacial pace.

475
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,835
You know how that thrills me.

476
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,405
[Khloé] What are you doing?

477
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,340
[laughter]

478
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,877
She's doing Miranda Priestly.

479
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,446
Meryl Streep, we're really sorry.
We're big fans of yours,

480
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:18,016
and this isn't a reflection
of your acting, of course.

481
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,220
By the time I'm done
with this whole new vibe of mine,

482
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,623
I am going to be feeling Miranda.

483
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,160
Let me ask you a question.
How much do you wanna be Kim Kardashian?

484
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,829
I gave birth to Kim Kardashian.

485
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,232
-She's nothing without me.
-[Kris] I was a Kardashian

486
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,967
-before you were a Kardashian.
-[Khloé] Miranda Priestly...

487
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,336
And I don't want to hear
another piece of [bleep]...

488
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,405
Miranda Priestly does not raise her voice.

489
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:41,673
She's that elegant.

490
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,443
And this frantic flickering...

491
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,211
That's more like Cruella de Vil.

492
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,281
Yeah, if you're trying to be
Miranda Priestly, study her.

493
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,484
Like, it's only the best movie ever,

494
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,687
[Kris] Okay. I'm gonna go upstairs
and practice some more.

495
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,856
-[Khloé] Okay.
-Okay.

496
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,725
-[laughing]
-Go upstairs and practice some more.

497
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,595
I'm going to get you a zi... zipper
for your mouth.

498
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,564
[Kris] That's all. Ta-ta.

499
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,133
Kim, hang that up.

500
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,970
Matthew, where's my coffee?
Did you die or something?

501
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,340
-How long is this gonna last for?
-[Kim] I don't know.

502
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,242
[Khloé] She's hysterical.

503
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,814
I made one comment, and she's so extra
that she's channeling Miranda Priestly.

504
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:26,885
I mean, I think it's obviously stupid
but fun to see her having this much fun.

505
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,422
Kourtney said I'm gonna be a bitch
for nine months, but I'm not a bitch.

506
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,858
Okay, good. I hope not.
I hope I was wrong.

507
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,327
-But no one else has said that but you.
-We will see.

508
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,862
Love to love you.

509
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,299
-What are you gonna say, you're sorry?
-[Kourtney] Love to love you.

510
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,735
-And?
-Sorry, not sorry. Sorry, not sorry.

511
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,837
[laughs]
Ow.

512
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,106
-You can't hit my vagina.
-Yes, I can.

513
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,842
-There's no baby up in there.
-Yeah.

514
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,245
[upbeat music]

515
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,887
{\an8}[Kourtney]
We both did ponytail vibes today.

516
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,655
[Khloé] Oh, my God!

517
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,157
There's something brewing.

518
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,059
Look how funny Reign is in baby class.

519
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,595
Everyone's, like, on the floor chilling,
and he, like, thinks he's the king.

520
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,998
He's so, so crazy. Where is this?

521
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,700
[Kourtney] My theater.

522
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,035
So, it's your house.
That's probably why he's also, like,

523
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,670
-roaming around.
-Yeah.

524
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,807
-So, you went to Dr. Huang yesterday?
-Yeah.

525
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,743
And now I feel like I don't know
if I want to do it.

526
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,811
[Khloé] Why?

527
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,346
Sarah did it, you know?

528
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,814
Oh, my God, yeah. She said that.

529
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,684
So, I was... She was telling me
that when you do, when she did the shots,

530
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,821
she was so on edge
that she could barely speak to anyone.

531
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:38,724
She was really depressed
for two months after.

532
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,094
'Cause the hormones.
It's like, they... You go so, so high,

533
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,528
and then it's like a crash.

534
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,498
Hmm. I'm on raging hormones now.

535
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,467
It makes me a lunatic.

536
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,435
Like, hormones suck.

537
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,837
But every person is different.

538
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,473
I mean, he said you could still, like...

539
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,342
Your chances go down, like, every year,

540
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,479
but I'm like,
"Is their information, like, correct?"

541
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,414
Let's be realistic. So, how many more kids

542
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,851
do you genuinely, genuinely want?

543
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,920
-Let's think about it.
-I don't feel like I'm done

544
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,155
having kids in life.

545
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,123
-I just don't.
-Okay.

546
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,224
Okay.

547
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,728
I mean, if you wanna get pregnant at 40,
if you have a partner, whoever,

548
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,598
Mom got pregnant at 40 and 41,
like, 100 years ago.

549
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,932
That's what I was thinking.

550
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,469
So then I'm like,
"Do I just let God's plan happen?"

551
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,539
[Kourtney]
I really don't like to take medication.

552
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,242
I try to do everything
as naturally as possible,

553
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,078
and so,
I just really have to think about it.

554
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,547
Do I want to freeze my eggs?

555
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,182
Because at this point right now,

556
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,117
I really don't know what I want to do.

-Is that her crying?
-[Kourtney] I've never seen you cry.

578
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,242
[Jen] <i>Because I'm just so happy,
and I love you.</i>

I wanted to tell you the other day,
but I just couldn't.

'Cause right, now nobody knows.

So, what's the other option?

We can't let my mom make
a mockery of Miranda,

625
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:30,121
so we're all gonna dress up as Miranda
and put on our best show.

626
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,790
And hopefully, that will inspire my mom.

627
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,458
I don't have anything that's Miranda,

628
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,560

-something of Kourt's.
-Yeah.

00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,631
-[Khloé] How many furs...
-Do you want a leopard trench?

632
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,466

That could work.

Or I have this fur from Cleveland.

-So we're all gonna be Miranda Priestly.

00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,663
[Khloé]
Your voice is a little too loud for me.

659
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,599
No.
[shushing]

660
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:51,469
What do you use those nails for?
Like, can openers?

661
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,807
They're disgusting.

662
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:59,310
Darling, you would do anything
to be me even for a minute.

663
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,649
I took a chance hiring
the smart, fat one as my manager.

664
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,184
I probably shouldn't have done that.

665
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,519
That will be all.

666
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,922
Thank you.

667
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,624
Never thought she'd leave.

668
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,528
They are trying to poke fun at my Miranda,

669
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,763
but this is no contest.

670
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,465
I win, hands down.

671
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,435
[Kris] I mean, I don't know
what's happened to these little fools.

672
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,838
They must have fallen down
on the pavement, hit their head.

673
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,442
You're sitting here eating all this food,
you animals.

674
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,177
You're just gonna get fat.

675
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,145
[Kourtney] Who eats food these days?

676
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,615
-Who decided that you had fashion sense?
-[Kourtney] It's 2017.

677
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,385
Have you noticed
I'm trying to ease out of fur?

678
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,786
-[Khloé] Food?
-[Kim] Fur.

679
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,288
-[Khloé] Hmm.
-[Kris] Kourtney.

680
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,925
My name is Miranda.
I'd like to be addressed that way, please.

681
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,460
My name is Miranda.

682
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,228
My name is Miranda.

683
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,964
Charlie, get the [bleep] over here!

684
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,834
-Mom, stop. What's wrong with you?
-[Kris] I don't know.

685
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,235
It just came out.

686
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:00,038
[Kris] Can I not get a [bleep] martini?

687
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,607
Was it not strong enough? Okay.

688
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,077
Kim, slide me that piece of paper
I had in my hand yesterday morning.

689
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,113
I have no idea what you're talking about.

690
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:12,183
The details of your incompetence
doesn't interest me.

691
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,952
[Khloé] Mom, I don't think you get
how fab you look.

692
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,254
-[Kris] Mm-hmm.
-[Kourtney] You really do look good, Mom.

693
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,989
-Of course I look good.
-You do.

694
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,325
-[Kris] Would you expect anything else?
-[Kourtney] Mm-mm.

695
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,428
We wanted to do this
in honor of Miranda Priestly.

696
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,096
[Khloé] We thought you needed
some improvement,

697
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,198
but you actually are doing
a phenomenal job,

698
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,767
and I think you should emulate this

699
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,602
-more often.
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.

700
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,304
'Cause it's chic and sexy.

701
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,140
Yeah, this is how you need
to handle business.

702
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,243
Let's raise a glass
to Kris [bleep] Jenner.

703
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,011
Kris mother[bleep] Jenner.

704
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,114
-[Kourtney] Whoo!
-Yeah, that's it, ladies.

705
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,752
If you guys will come dressed like this
every single time I have a meeting,

706
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,488
I promise you we will rule the world.

707
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,656
[Kourtney] You got it.

708
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,593
-[Scott] Hey.
-[Kim] Scott's here.

709
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,762
Oh, I had no idea.

710
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,965
-What the [bleep] is going on here?
-[Kris laughing]

711
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,467
This a joke?

712
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,868
[Kourtney] Just having a dinner.

713
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,370
-[laughs]
-[Scott] Is that a wig?

714
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:10,508
Please, darling, bore somebody else
with your questions.

715
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:11,876
What is the vibe here?

716
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,045
[Kris] Uh, it's called a martini vibe.

717
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,548
-What? What?
-[Kim] She's wasted.

718
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,449
You better not be driving home.

719
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,685
[Kris] I don't have to drive home, I'm me.

720
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,521
[chuckles]

721
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:29,160
It's really been fun,
but being somebody else is a lot of work.

722
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,363
And I might just retire the blonde wig.

723
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,364
Okay, we're done.

724
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,401
Oh, it's...

725
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,469
[laughs]

726
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,339
It's clipped in.

727
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,507
I got to go.

728
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,310
[upbeat music]

729
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:55,553
{\an8}Okay, guys, so my dream tutorial of life
has always been

730
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,357
{\an8}to give my grandma, MJ, a little makeover.

731
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,361
But what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna give you that Kylie Jenner lip.

732
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,930
You have to have huge lips.

733
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,099
Don't your lips look amazing?

734
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,968
You did a good job, Kim.

735
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,203
As Khloé would say, DSLs.

736
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,671
Do you know what that means?

737
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:17,842
-Go "F" yourself, or something...
-Something like that. Yeah.

738
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,777
[phone ringing]

739
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,513
-I went to see Kylie's house yesterday.
-[Kim] Hello?

740
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,015
{\an8}Oh, she got a phone call.

741
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,049
[Tracy] <i>They just called me and they said,</i>

742
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,118
<i>"If you don't call us
within the next five minutes</i>

743
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,320
<i>and tell us that it's not true,
then we're running the story."</i>

744
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,522
[tense music]

745
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,992
[Khloé] <i>Tristan said,
"Just don't comment, regardless."</i>

746
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,997
TMZ was texting us that they know
that Khloé is pregnant.

747
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:43,101
[Kim] And it's such a tricky thing
'cause people expect us

748
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,070
to share every last detail of our lives.

749
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,606
It's almost like
we're not entitled to privacy.

750
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:52,343
[Tracy] <i>Should I try to call them
and say, "Listen, it's true,</i>

751
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,645
<i>but will you work with us</i>

752
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,280
<i>and wait till she's at least 12 weeks</i>

753
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,981
<i>to do the announcement?"</i>

754
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,750
<i>Just to buy a little bit of time.</i>

755
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,985
I mean, I think you can't lie about it.

756
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,320
How far along are you?

757
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,355
[Khloé] <i>Ten.</i>

758
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,593
<i>So it's, like, so stupid.</i>

759
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,095
[Tracy] <i>I guess in the grand scheme of it,</i>

760
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,164
<i>it's really if you guys had plans</i>

761
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,199
<i>to, sort of, do the announcement
on your own.</i>

762
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,567
Well, he said he's gonna put it up.

763
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,203
So if he's gonna put it up
within five minutes of us not,

764
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,672
we might not have a choice.

765
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,108
I think it's just really unfortunate
for Khloé

766
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,577
'cause she's not past her first trimester

767
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,447
and she just, you know,
isn't ready to talk about it yet.

768
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,916
But at this point,
there's nothing we can really do.

769
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,117
It's gonna get published.

770
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:37,855
And it's just really unfortunate
that people are so nosy.

771
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,724
[tense music continues]

772
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,598
{\an8}[Khloé] How's your surrogate doing?

773
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,300
[Kim] She's doing good.

774
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,337
We went to the doctor
on Saturday together,

775
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,371
and I brought Kanye.

776
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,939
-That's good.
-Yeah.

777
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,642
-How's the babe?
-Everything's going good.

778
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,811
-Cooking? Just cooking in there?
-Yeah.

779
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,179
Yeah, she's getting big.

780
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:05,550
Even though I will appreciate
not having to gain the weight

781
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,352
and lose the weight, I will say,

782
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:09,954
like, I still would have rather done it
on my own.

783
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,256
-Really? You hated your pregnancy.
-Yeah.

784
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,626
I just would rather feel connected.

785
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,596
Like, I just hope I care as much.

786
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,032
-I think you will. Yeah.
-You know what I mean? That's what, like...

787
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,836
Everyone says it's, like,
no different, you know?

788
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,371
[Khloé] You'll love her.

789
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,641
I appreciate you and Trace,
like, helping me.

790
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:35,513
I always was like, "God, why do people
withhold their pregnancies?

791
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,015
Why don't they just say something?"

792
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,318
Like, in my situation, I'm sure
in so many others, like, they are...

793
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,953
I don't know
if it's high-risk or whatever,

794
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,023
but there are just chances
that, you know, God forbid,

795
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,092
you don't make it past a certain point.

796
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,228
[pensive music]

797
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,897
I'm like,
"Oh, my God, just show some respect."

798
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,766
Obviously, when I'm ready,

799
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,002
when there's a healthy point
where I can say something, I will.

800
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,571
I can totally relate.
Like, we didn't tell anyone.

801
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,508
So for it to get out
that we hired a surrogate,

802
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,209
now they're all writing me.

803
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:08,746
And we didn't want anyone to know yet
until we got to a certain point.

804
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,550
Tristan only told
a very limited amount of people.

805
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:16,120
So you don't want everyone
to find out via the Internet.

806
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,122
You want to tell people yourself.

807
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:21,492
Just, like, people take
all of that away from you.

808
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,030
I've tried really hard
to keep my pregnancy safe,

809
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,865
I guess I would say, and a secret.

810
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,535
And somehow, some way,

811
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,370
TMZ published the article.

812
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,910
There's nothing I can do
about the article. It's out.

813
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,112
But I'm not gonna confirm it yet.

814
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,148
[Khloé] Because I'm still waiting
to be in a safe spot.

815
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,984
And that's my choice to do that.

816
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,653
That's my decision.

817
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,288
At least, I would think.

818
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,356
My first baby book.

819
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,058
Isn't that funny? I saw it and I was like,

820
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,960
"Oh, my God,
I have to get this for Khloé."

821
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,329
I really don't want
to have to deal with that...

822
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,798
belly button and umbilical cord thing.

823
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,101
It's, like, so nasty.

824
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,002
Like, I can't take it.

825
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,872
Listen, with all the stories
you and Kourtney have thrown my way,

826
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,241
-what can you do?
-Pray for the vest.

827
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,045
-Did you say the "vest"?
-I did, by accident.

828
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,113
Pray for the vest.

829
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,515
[upbeat music]

830
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,319
<i>What the [bleep] is wrong with you?
Take the [bleep] photo!</i>

831
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,457
{\an8}[Kris] This is your lucky day
'cause I have a present for you.

832
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,061
Wait, this little frame is yours
from when you were a baby.

833
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,665
-Oh, so cute.
-Isn't it cute?

834
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,601
Do you just not really know whose it is

835
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,370
-but you're taking a guess?
-No, it's yours. I remember it's yours.

836
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,273
There's another one that was yours,
but it got so rusted.

837
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,443
And I'm giving you this
as your present for Friday.

838
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,612
What was Friday?

839
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,080
I feel like I'm over it.

840
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,314
You don't like it?

841
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,916
-Okay, never mind.
-What was Friday?

842
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,318
No, I'm just saying,
it's, like, your Friday gift.

843
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,754
Okay, she doesn't want my gift. It's fine.

844
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,824
[Kourtney]
I was just gonna ask you something.

845
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,964
Um, so, I was deciding about...

846
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,700
-freezing my eggs.
-Yeah.

847
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,871
'Cause I kind of had to...
wrap my head around it.

848
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,042
Well, it's definitely challenging,

849
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,444
but it's really, obviously,
worth it in the end.

850
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,413
But do I leave it in God's hands

851
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,183
and if it's meant to be,
just, like, do it then,

852
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,350
when... if I want to do that?

853
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,520
No. Because the younger you are
when you freeze your eggs,

854
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,689
the better the... your result is gonna be.

855
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:32,723
Mm-hmm.

856
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,726
If I were you, I would really
take advantage of the technology

857
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,962
and give yourself that insurance policy.

858
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,731
And then if you get pregnant
on your own, yay.

859
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:45,870
I mean, I had Kendall at 40.
And Kylie at 41.

860
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:46,904
But I was lucky.

861
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,573
You know, some women don't make,

862
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,709
you know, eggs that are viable
after they're 35.

863
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,646
-Yeah.
-So you're too close to 40

864
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,583
to not take advantage
of this window of opportunity.

865
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,751
Get these eggs warmed up

866
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:04,388
before, you know, it becomes dormant,
if you know what I mean.

867
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:09,026
Yeah, but I just don't think
I'm gonna do it right now.

868
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,429
[sighs]

869
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,198
[Kourtney] I just don't feel ready.

870
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:18,636
Like, I feel like there's a lot going on,
and I just don't feel like I'm ready to...

871
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:22,173
Like, my body's ready to go through that
right this minute.

872
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,977
And I think, in a few months,
I can think about it again.

873
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,646
[Kris] I just...
I feel like it's a huge mistake.

874
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,417
[light music]

875
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,759
-How are you? Good to see you!
-[Khloé] Nice to see you.

876
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,327
{\an8}-You by yourself?
-Yes.

877
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,197
-[Dr. Aliabadi] How are you feeling? Good.
-[Khloé] Good.

878
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,600
So I'm gonna do
your genetic blood test today.

879
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,303
And I'll call you, hopefully,
by the end of this week...

880
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,305
-[Khloé] Okay.
-...and tell you what you're having.

881
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,108
Kylie was like,
"I want to be the first phone call."

882
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,609
And I was like, "Why?"

883
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,177
-Oh, for me to call her?
-Yeah.

884
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,013
Well, if you give me permission, I can.

885
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,449
I wanted just to know
why she wants to know so badly. So...

886
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,219
If I say girl, she'll call you and say,
"You're having a boy."

887
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,087
[both laughing]

888
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,957
-Probably. Probably.
-Let's see.

889
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,626
[Khloé] I don't know why I'm nervous.

890
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,229
[Dr. Aliabadi] Lots of pressure.

891
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,531
[tense music]

892
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,033
Lots of pressure.

893
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,872
[Khloé] I don't know why I'm nervous.

894
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,241
[Dr. Aliabadi] Lots of pressure.

895
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,345
Lots of pressure.

896
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,050
Hello, munchkin.

897
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,486
Look at this baby.

898
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,121
[heart beating over speaker]

899
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,823
Look at that.

900
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,492
[Khloé] Thank God its head is evening out.
[laughs]

901
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,161
Its head was so big at first.

902
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,229
-It was so weird.
-It's normal.

903
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,731
[Khloé] I know.

904
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,534
[Dr. Aliabadi]
Almost five centimeters. Perfect.

905
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,337
-Here you go.
-Tristan loves these things.

906
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,005
You can't even see what this looks like.

907
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:04,041
[Dr. Aliabadi] You can.
So, the head is right here.

908
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,343
-You see it?
-Mm-hmm.

909
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,945
[Dr. Aliabadi]
Look at that arm right next to the head.

910
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,547
-[Khloé] It's moving it?
-[Dr. Aliabadi] It's waving.

911
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:10,748
[Khloé] Oh, my God.

912
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,783
-[Dr. Aliabadi] Hi, baby!
-[Khloé chuckles]

913
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,318
-Cute.
-[Dr. Aliabadi] The cutest.

914
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,687
[Khloé]
At least we know it's not camera shy.

915
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,689
-[Dr. Aliabadi] Can't be.
-No.

916
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:22,593
-This baby's perfect. Measures perfectly.
-Thank God.

917
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,528
[Khloé] I am so relieved.

918
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,099
I am finally over my first trimester.
I'm on to my second.

919
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:31,168
It's so exciting,
so I'm kind of out of that danger zone.

920
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:34,271
I'm off of my progesterone.
I'm feeling really good.

921
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:37,908
You know, I was told
the pregnancy will fly by, so to enjoy it.

922
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,745
And it's... I mean, it's really flying by.

923
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,547
-All right. Anything else?
-No.

924
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,050
So vitamins. Continue exercising.

925
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:50,221
I'll call you, hopefully, on Friday
and tell you what you're having.

926
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,656
-Well, does he care? Does he...
-Yeah.

927
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,225
-He wants a boy?
-Yeah.

928
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,561
I just said, "Don't [bleep] put
that pressure on me. It is... You did...

929
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,864
-You pick the sex, so that's up to you."
-[Dr. Aliabadi] Exactly.

930
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,499
I was like,
"You're gonna love it no matter what.

931
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,535
Trust me,
everyone who has a girl is, like... melts."

932
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,569
{\an8}He'll be fine.

933
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,538
{\an8}[Dr. Aliabadi] I mean, ask your mom.

934
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,939
{\an8}Yeah, no, it's fine.

935
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,009
{\an8}-It will be all right.
-[Dr. Aliabadi] All right, very good.

936
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,179
{\an8}[Kim] <i>On the next episode...</i>

937
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,549
{\an8}-We're going to San Fran!
-San Francisco, here we come.

938
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,683
{\an8}[Khloé] We've been waiting for you

939
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,951
{\an8}-for 30 minutes.
-I was getting ready!

940
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:24,789
{\an8}[Khloé] I don't want to go on trips
if this is how you are every [bleep] time.

941
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,791
{\an8}[Kim] My surrogate is in town,

942
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:30,161
{\an8}so I thought it would be an amazing time
for her to meet my family.

943
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,762
{\an8}Guys?

944
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,632
{\an8}[phone ringing]

945
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,067
{\an8}[Khloé] I'm dying to know
the gender of my baby.

946
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,036
{\an8}[Kylie] Okay, are you sitting?

947
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,638
{\an8}Kylie, say it!
