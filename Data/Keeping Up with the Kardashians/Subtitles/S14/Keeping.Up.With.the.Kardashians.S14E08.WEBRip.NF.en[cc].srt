00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,800
{\an8}-[man] Are you guys excited for ice cream?
-[gasps]

4
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,268
{\an8}-Awesome.
-Are you excited?

5
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,138
The Ice Cream Museum is just super cool.

6
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,973
It's like something different
to do in town.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,510
Yeah. Who wouldn't want to swim
in a bed of sprinkles? Like, come on.

8
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,879
Kim, turn around and stand on the phone.

00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,348
[upbeat music]

10
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,916
[Jonathan] So exciting.

11
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,619
[Kim] Oh, walk on the stars.
Oh, Scoop Dogg?

12
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,155
Kim Carbstashian?

13
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,157
You guys, I finally got a star.

14
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:02,429
-[Kourtney] Ah, you guys are so cute.
-Wait, it's even better.

15
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,799
Here you go, Bo. Cheers.

16
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,903
Remember, guys,
try not to dive or jump into the pool.

17
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:13,339
A pool of sprinkles? Holy Food God!

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,141
Oh, there's a diving board.

19
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,744
[Kim] How fun, guys! Whoo!

20
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,712
[Kim chuckling]

00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,082
[overlapping chatter]

22
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,452
-Ah!
-Hey!

23
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,352
[coughs]

24
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,723
-[Jonathan] This is good.
-Food God dies by choking on sprinkles!

25
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,927
[upbeat music]

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,203
[Kim] Look, a whole store
of sewing machines.

27
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:48,575
Mason loves to sew. He loves it.
He'll go, "Mom, I want to sew."

28
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,378
What the hell does he sew?

29
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,915
They make stuffed animals
and they sell them on a website,

30
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,584
and it goes to, like, a charity.

31
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,654
Remember when we used to come down here
to do all the buying for DASH?

32
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,224
I swear, we, like, parked
in one of these parking lots.

33
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,695
I used to have an apartment
on 7th & Flower. The good old days.

34
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,098
[Kim] You're allowed to just put a tent
on the side of the road?

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,468
There's so many, like...

36
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,938
[Khloé] If you look up all these streets,
there's tons of tents.

37
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,941
Like, up all...
Every street here, I'm seeing tents.

38
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,379
[Kourtney] I should have driven my kids
by here when they were down here.

39
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,047
Dad used to drive us down here.

40
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,251
Yeah, but we were just
at that Ice Cream Museum.

41
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,886
Like, we should have driven by...

42
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,021
with them.

43
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,791
My dad used to drive us to Skid Row
when we were little

44
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,495
to just show us that the rest of the world
doesn't really live

45
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:46,399
like how we live in Beverly Hills
and that always stuck with me.

46
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,369
[somber music]

47
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,238
And then when I had kids, like,
everything kind of opens up,

48
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,041
and you want our world to be
the most perfect place for them,

49
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,044
and your awareness
just becomes so heightened.

50
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,148
Just so much has changed of things
I was just oblivious to before.

51
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,387
[Kim] But it's not enough to witness it.
I really want to do something about it.

52
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,261
[Khloé] It's so sad.

53
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,234
[upbeat music]

54
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,312
{\an8}-[Khloé] Matthew, is my mom in her office?
-[Matthew] Yes.

55
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,580
[Khloé] Thank you.

56
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,551
-Hello, darling. <i>Bonjour.
-Bonjour.</i>

57
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,888
You snuck this one on
just so ever so quickly.

58
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,856
[Kris] I always have your covers here,

59
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:48,261
and all the new covers
get to be on the presidential desk.

60
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,863
-Oh, my goodness.
-[Kris] Isn't it exciting?

61
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,799
I'm so excited for our barbecue.

62
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,369
-What barbecue?
-[Khloé] Mom, you're joking.

63
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,737
-Mom...
-[Kris] When's the barbecue?

64
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,039
-Mom!
-[Kris] Is it today?

65
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,042
Are you okay? Like, do you...
Like, are you losing it?

66
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,145
-Maybe.
-We had a whole conversation.

67
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,448
We're having a barbecue
and you are making a dish.

68
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,750
[Khloé] You're bringing it over
and everyone's coming to the house.

69
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,954
150 percent,
you've never mentioned a barbecue.

70
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,823
-All right.
-[Kris] Okay?

71
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,593
So nothing's ever slipped your mind
in the past, right?

72
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,631
[Khloé] Hold Post-its in your hand
and start sticking things places.

73
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,699
-Okay.
-[Khloé] Like, "brush my teeth."

74
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,470
"Wipe my ass." Like, that should be
in the bathroom, like, when the door,

75
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,839
-when you shut it.
-I've got those little details covered.

76
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,508
-Oh, so those things you remember.
-[Kris] Yeah.

77
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,478
You just forget family barbecues
and the dishes to make.

78
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,547
I am constantly multi-tasking

79
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,784
and trying to take care
of a gazillion things at the same time.

80
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,488
And I'm always working
on my organizational skills

81
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:53,526
and trying to figure out how to become
more organized and more productive.

82
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,196
[Khloé] Well, you've just been holding
this pen for how long?

83
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,798
No, I was gonna write it for the...

84
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,933
[Khloé] Do you keep forgetting
what you have to write?

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,670
-It's like, where is my note cards?
-Do you want me to tell you?

86
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,772
-"Barbecue."
-Here it is. Here it is.

87
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,974
-Barbecue.
-[Khloé] "Bring a dish of your choice."

88
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,744
[Kris] Barbecue. See?
It helps when I write it down.

89
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,479
[Khloé] Kris Kardashian?

90
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,748
Did you forget what your last name is too?

91
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,750
[laughter]

92
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,985
Did you?

93
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,489
[Kim] <i>Oh, my gosh.
Look what Kylie is tempting me with...</i>

94
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,429
{\an8}So I would have to go to Cleveland,
and then go there.

95
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,633
-[Kris] Where are you going?
-[Khloé] Maybe Anguilla. I'm not sure.

96
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,735
[Kris]
Oh, so you can't bring back the doughnuts?

97
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,404
I could bring you doughnuts, Mom.

98
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,408
-[Kris] Hey.
-[Khloé] Penelope.

99
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,777
I just hired a scriber.

100
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,046
-[Tristan] <i>You did?</i>
-Yeah. Do you know what a scriber is?

101
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,249
-<i>Yeah, they write down everything.</i>
-Yeah. Everything I say.

102
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,785
<i>Everything you say, so yeah,
keep it all for, like, memories.</i>

103
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,523
That's right 'cause I, I'm getting older
and I feel like I can't remember anything.

104
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,361
So I need to write it down
because five minutes later...

105
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,263
I called Kendall today. Two minutes later,
I didn't know why I called her.

106
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:09,268
I'm at the doctor and I realize that
there's someone standing right next to him

107
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,206
writing down on a little table
every single thing he says.

108
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,775
[Kris] And I ask him, what is she doing?

109
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,744
And he said, "That's my scribe.

110
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,780
She keeps track
of every single thing I say and do,

111
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,982
because I can refer to it later."

112
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:29,722
And a huge light bulb goes off.
This is genius.

113
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,326
That I can have somebody follow me around
every single day

114
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:38,664
and then repeat back to me
what I said or did. This is everything.

115
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,633
-<i>All right, babe. I'll talk to you later.</i>
-Okay.

116
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,535
-Love you.
-<i>I love you, too.</i>

117
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,006
[Kourtney]
It's crazy that you're getting a scribe.

118
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,610
I want everything I say documented
from now on.

119
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:52,945
[Kris] There's so much I miss.

120
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,615
Do you know how much stuff
is rolling around up here in this head?

121
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,051
Like, just this side alone,
I walk around like this

122
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,820
'cause there's so much stuff over here
and then some days,

123
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,222
-I'll walk around like that over there.
-Isn't Lovely so silly?

124
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,658
-How silly is she?
-So I need somebody to write it all down.

125
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,894
And then, when I can't remember
what I was supposed to do,

126
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,928
or what I meant to say,

127
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,396
or take it to a meeting,

128
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,167
I have somebody right there that...
Chop-chop, we have a scriber.

129
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,469
It's a scribe. Scribe.

130
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,338
Whatever. A scribe for my tribe.

131
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,741
[laughs]

132
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,110
[laughing]
Yeah, oh, yeah.

133
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,013
[upbeat music]

134
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,920
{\an8}-[Khloé] How's your diet been going?
-[Kim] Good.

135
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,255
You know, I had
a few gluten-free pretzels today,

136
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,325
which threw me off,
'cause that's carbs, but it's fine.

137
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,928
Gluten-free, it's like you're eating air.

138
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:42,962
Not really.

139
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,766
I feel like that's gonna be the...
like, the trick, 'cause people think that.

140
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,967
[Khloé] Mm.

141
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,672
After we went downtown,
didn't you feel, like, so bad?

142
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,208
Like, there were so many people.

143
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,044
[Khloé] It's definitely different
than when, like, Dad used to take us.

144
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,747
I think people are blind, and people
kind of like to live in their bubble...

145
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,417
-Yeah.
-...and ignore what's really going on.

146
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,653
[Kim] I just want to work
with, like, some organization.

147
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,256
I don't know what...
which one, or where to go,

148
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,326
but I just feel like there's something
that we can do to help.

149
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:17,263
For sure, I think you would definitely...
I mean, it's easy to find an organization

150
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,400
that would love to have your, uh,
like, help and to bring awareness to it.

151
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,505
I am just at a point in my life
where I don't want to be naive anymore,

152
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,475
and I just want to use my platform
to get other people involved.

153
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,244
And I really do want to learn

154
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,181
and figure out what we can all do
to fix this problem.

155
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,552
[upbeat music]

156
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,560
-[Khloé] I'm working out tonight.
-[Kim] Why?

157
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,029
Just because I'm as fat
as [bleep] fat can be.

158
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:50,963
[Kim] Mm.

159
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,871
-[Kourtney] Hey, Mom.
-[Kris] Hi.

160
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,473
-[Khloé] Hi.
-How are you guys?

161
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,544
-[Khloé] Oh, wow. You look beautiful.
-[Kris] Thank you. This is Madhvi.

162
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,112
-Nice to meet you.
-She is my scribe.

163
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,147
[quirky music]

164
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,353
-Are you being serious?
-Yeah.

165
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,622
Oh.

166
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:21,460
Wait, when you're having a conversation,
does Madhvi also record what I'm saying,

167
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,195
or just what you're saying?

168
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,831
-[Kris] What everybody's saying.
-Okay. Just curious.

169
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,933
Right?

170
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,534
-[Madhvi] Mm-hmm.
-[Kris] Mm-hmm.

171
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,403
[keyboard keys clacking]

172
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,040
I mean, it's kind of amazing.
I can look back and tell you

173
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,675
exactly what I said.

174
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,043
There's no doubt.

175
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,447
Meeting the scribe for the first time
is just strange.

176
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:45,618
Do you really want
everything documented? Everything?

177
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,754
All right,
I'm gonna make a urination sample.

178
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,390
Mom, do you have to pee
or are you good with your diaper?

179
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,926
[keyboard keys clacking]

180
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,995
[quirky music]

181
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:01,100
I just feel like, let's just make
Kris Jenner so uncomfortable, it's fun.

182
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,503
[Khloé] What? She queefed in our workroom
the other day.

183
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,472
-I did not.
-[Khloé] Yes, you did.

184
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,242
She was queefing. She did. Queef.

185
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,012
[laughs]
I did not.

186
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,416
[Kris] You are funny.
You're funny to have around.

187
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,951
[Khloé] Me? Oh, thanks.

188
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,654
But I will say, as a child,
the way you used to talk to me

189
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,956
when I thought my name was [bleep]head.

190
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,328
And all you do is get drunk. It's wild.
Please call Child Services.

191
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,897
You have no idea what I go through
on a nightly basis.

192
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,999
Don't punish me

193
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,834
because somebody's writing
everything down.

194
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,302
It's not funny anymore.

195
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,771
[upbeat music]

196
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:50,282
I was trying to get in touch with my mom,
but she isn't calling me back.

197
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,855
I just know something's up with her,
so why not ask Kim, her favorite child?

198
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,191
-So, question.
-Yeah.

199
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:03,362
When we were at dinner with Mom,
do you think Mom had a nice time?

200
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,598
[Khloé] Or do you think she was angry?

201
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:12,004
I think she was, like, laughing a lot,
nervously laughing.

202
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,374
-Did you think she...
-[Kim] You hurt her feelings?

203
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,611
-[Khloé] Yeah.
-Yeah, just because I know her.

204
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,747
From the moment you started,
I knew she was, like, gonna...

205
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,850
Then why would she say, "You're so funny"?

206
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,154
Because I think she was nervous
at the moment in front of the girl.

207
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,589
Then, why have the scribe?
Like, it's stupid.

208
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,224
Don't just be, "What?"

209
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,462
Like, obviously, you didn't chain me
to a wall, and it's my first time leaving.

210
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,433
Obviously, I didn't think my name
was [bleep]head until I was ten.

211
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,669
-[Khloé] Obviously, like, come on.
-Yeah. I mean, I get it.

212
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,938
-Just, like... This family, I can't handle.
-[Kim] 'Cause I...

213
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,840
[Khloé] You look cute.

214
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,677
-[Kendall] Do I?
-Your belly button is so vertical.

215
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,812
[Khloé] I'm envious.

216
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,780
I literally will get Botox

217
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,216
around my belly button
just so it looks like that.

218
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,052
-What? Who does this for you?
-Well, I don't.

219
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,987
I'm going to, is what I'm saying.

220
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,356
-I'll do anything to tighten the skin.
-No one's offered me that.

221
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,460
[upbeat music]

222
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,568
-Hi, ladies. I'm Andy.
-[Khloé] Hi. How are you?

223
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,737
{\an8}-Hi. Khloé. Nice to meet you.
-Great to see you, Khloé.

224
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,672
{\an8}-[Khloé] This is Kim.
-Hi, Kim. Great to meet you.

225
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,574
{\an8}-Hi, I'm Alexandra.
-Hi. Khloé.

226
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,977
{\an8}[Andy] I wanted to take you
on a little tour if you have time.

227
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,746
-[Khloé] Yeah, we would love that.
-[Kim] Yeah, for sure.

228
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,682
[Kim] As I've been doing my research,

229
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,217
I just feel like
I have to start somewhere,

230
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,220
and this is the perfect place for me
to get some more information,

231
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,223
and to figure out all of the questions
that I really have

232
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,225
as to what we can do to help.

233
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,662
[Kim] I just hope that I can shine a light
on this issue, and that, hopefully,

234
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:47,466
more people will come together,
and we can figure out a solution for this.

235
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,968
Oh, wow.

236
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:54,440
[Andy] This is our beautiful rooftop
with one of the best views of downtown LA.

237
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,550
[Kim] So, like, all these people
that are just roaming the streets,

238
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,685
do they not want to come and stay here?

239
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,989
[Andy] There just aren't enough
shelter beds in LA,

240
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,292
so 47,000 people are on the streets,

241
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,129
and there's only 12,000 shelter beds
to go to.

242
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:23,369
This is the worst man-made disaster
in the United States.

243
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,071
Over 2,000 people living on our sidewalks.

244
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,774
And, you know, people say
they want people to get off the streets.

245
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,942
There's nowhere to go.

246
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,178
[Andy] I can tell you, recently,

247
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,981
what's causing it to skyrocket
is the cost of rent.

248
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:40,486
Rents have gone up 30 percent.
Salaries have gone down 3 percent.

249
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:44,890
It's like a perfect storm of homelessness,
especially in LA.

250
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,727
This year, we have 55 percent more people
under our roof.

251
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,363
-And do you guys have the space for that?
-[Andy] We've made space.

252
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,765
We never turn away a woman,

253
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,734
because there's 800 registered
sex offenders on the streets,

254
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,603
so our hearts won't let us.

255
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,074
The homeless issue is a full epidemic,

256
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:06,445
and I don't know what the answer is
to get people off the streets,

257
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,683
but you know, I'm so willing to help
in any way that I can.

258
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,120
You cannot survive on the streets
without being brutalized

259
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,324
and devastated by the experience.

260
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,293
I just want to bring awareness
to this issue.

261
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,164
Unfortunately, people do live in bubbles,

262
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,601
and people probably think,
like, LA is this glamorous place.

263
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:33,239
[Kim] And it makes me feel really sad
that people are just living like this,

264
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,241
and the problem's just getting worse.

265
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,644
{\an8}[light music]

266
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,914
[Andy] This is the floor
that our families with children stay on.

267
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,583
[Alexandra] You can see everybody's
bags of clothing and everything.

268
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,588
We want to make sure our women feel safe,
so we have separate floors for everybody.

269
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,427
Hi. This is Khloé. This is Kim.
This is Alex Cornejo.

270
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,330
{\an8}-Hi. Kim.
-Hi. Khloé. Nice to see you.

271
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,766
Alex is somebody that came through
our men's program,

272
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,435
and has been working here
a little bit longer than me.

273
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,805
[Khloé] Do you guys want to sit down,
or get comfortable?

274
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,476
Recently, we drove by,

275
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:14,546
and we noticed how much it's escalated,
the homelessness here, and...

276
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,682
-from when we were younger.
-How many tents there are.

277
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,753
And just... we were, like, shocked
by what it looked like.

278
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:24,123
And so for us,
we really wanted to educate ourselves

279
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,860
as to kind of why I think
it's, like, multiplied,

280
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,164
and just kind of hear stories,
and maybe, like, what we can do.

281
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:36,902
So Laquita, uh, I wanted you to share,
because I think Laquita's a great example

282
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,805
of somebody who didn't suffer
from any of those issues

283
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,440
that you usually, typically ask.

284
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,276
{\an8}[Alexandra] Like, is this person addicted?
Is there mental illness?

285
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,312
{\an8}She was just a mom who needed a hand up.

286
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,952
Um, I just didn't have a job that paid
well enough for me to get my own place,

287
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,287
-you know, and to support us.
-Yeah.

288
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,457
We all don't come
from abusive points of view,

289
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,826
or running away
from our husbands or boyfriends,

290
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,429
or we have drug or alcohol...

291
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:08,300
Sometimes you just need a place
to... take a breath and to move on.

292
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,502
-Thank you for sharing.
-[Laquita] Yeah.

293
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,837
The reason I'm here

294
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:16,742
{\an8}is because I don't think
I can afford to pay housing on my own

295
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,010
for my one-bedroom apartment.

296
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,081
I go to my brother's house
and he likes to smoke drugs.

297
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,649
[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

298
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,185
And I can't stand that.
I don't even want to be around.

299
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,554
I don't want to see it. I drove down here,

300
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,158
and I didn't know this program here
at the Union was like it was.

301
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:37,062
It's a good program
if people do what they came here to do.

302
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,665
But if they don't...
[chuckles]

303
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,066
...that's why they end up out there.

304
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,402
[Latanya]
The things that I've seen down here...

305
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,771
nasty things.
[chuckles]

306
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,839
[Khloé] Right.

307
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,175
There are so many circumstances

308
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,812
that can lead to, you know,
this situation for so many people.

309
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,649
[Kim] And I think just having a place
where they take in mothers

310
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,018
and their children,

311
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,122
that is so important,
because they are so vulnerable,

312
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:09,328
when they're on the streets, to rapists
and pedophiles and drug trafficking.

313
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,063
This can happen to anyone.

314
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,832
It's just really sad
to hear that, you know,

315
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,002
so many people are just one paycheck away
from being homeless.

316
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:19,671
[Patrice] My name is Patrice.

317
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:24,610
{\an8}I became homeless probably in 2014
due to financial hardship.

318
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,047
I'd been doing it on my own,
hit financial hardship,

319
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:32,351
lost my income and became homeless,
then went to stay with friends.

320
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,586
And, you know,
staying with friends don't work out a lot,

321
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,388
so end up back on the street.

322
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,558
-[Kim] It's okay.
-But that's where I'm at now.

323
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,528
[Patrice] But they gave me a voucher.
I'm looking for a place now.

324
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,797
And I've been here since Saturday.

325
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,198
-[Khloé] Since Saturday?
-Mm-hmm.

326
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,435
For most of society,
it seems like there's this net or web

327
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,503
{\an8}that kind of catches you when you fall.

328
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,940
{\an8}I think for some, that net or web...
there was never the father,

329
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:58,610
there was never the mother, there was
never aunts and uncles to help facilitate.

330
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,546
And so they just kind of
fell through the cracks,

331
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,247
and all of a sudden, now they end up here,

332
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,749
that it's just completely inundated.

333
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,886
Thank you guys so much
for sharing your stories with us.

334
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,254
Thank you for coming.

335
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,157
-[Khloé] Thank you.
-Thank you.

336
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,358
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

337
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,228
-And thank you.
-Bye.

[pensive music]

339
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,070
[Khloé] Thank you, I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

340
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,573
So crazy.

341
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:33,145
I mean, just these people
are such good people.

342
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,581
[Khloé] You know, I do think,
like, I don't know.

343
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,082
Dad always made us do things,

344
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,519
so like, I have never been scared
of stuff like this.

345
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,721
[Kim] I mean, obviously,
to have awareness.

346
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,856
[Khloé] Totally.

347
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,527
I think it is important
to teach your kids that stuff.

348
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,762
[Kim] Totally. I think it's so important.

349
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,366
From this experience, I've learned
that it's just not that simple.

350
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,337
The city needs to figure out housing,
and it's not gonna be just one person.

351
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:02,274
It has to be a bunch of people
coming together to figure this out.

352
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,611
[pensive music]

353
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,247
Just seeing how many people
don't really have an option

354
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,315
really was so sad.

355
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,283
So sad.

356
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,321
{\an8}[tranquil music]

357
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,423
{\an8}[birds chirping]

358
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,765
{\an8}Oh, my God.
I've never sat in this little chair.

359
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,966
You haven't?

360
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,235
-[Khloé] No.
-It's cozy.

361
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,104
[Kim] Um...

362
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,473
That was pretty intense.

363
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,243
-[Khloé] Yeah.
-Wait. I want to look up some stuff.

364
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,047
-That was really sad.
-So I just want to google,

365
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:45,584
like, other things on Skid Row,
because I feel like...

366
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,252
[sniffles]

367
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,889
...there's just so many more,
like, untold stories.

368
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,692
I wonder how many shelters are downtown.

369
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,964
'Cause when we were driving by that time,
we were naming shelters.

370
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,567
[Kim] Do you want to watch this?

371
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,735
[Nury]
<i>I have real concerns about this. Um...</i>

372
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,672
{\an8}<i>When we talk about all of us sharing</i>

373
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,976
{\an8}<i>the burden of how... and how we deal
with the homeless issue,</i>

374
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,615
{\an8}<i>we have paid the price
of poor land use decisions</i>

375
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,284
{\an8}<i>for people who live
in these sensitive areas.</i>

376
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:23,155
{\an8}<i>And now we're saying it's okay
to have people live in their vehicles,</i>

377
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,958
{\an8}<i>in these very areas
that we're trying to protect people from.</i>

378
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,895
<i>It's going to become a problem</i>

379
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:34,166
<i>in the Northeast San Fernando Valley,
particularly City 7 and City 6.</i>

380
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,235
<i>I brought my father home
from the hospital...</i>

381
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,571
There's a lot that I think can be done
in our community,

382
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,874
and it starts
with just getting the information.

383
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,411
Councilwoman Nury Martinez,
I just feel like

384
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:50,148
she would give me some major insight
on what I can do to help.

385
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:55,320
I mean, it seems like she really cares
and really wants to change the situation.

386
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:00,959
And I feel like that's what,
you know, is most important.

387
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,928
-What do you want to do?
-[Kim] I don't know.

388
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,497
[Khloé] If I'm in town, I'll go with you.

389
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,868
[Kim] But, like, it's crazy that there's
so much, like, in our neighborhood.

390
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,571
So close to us, there's so much going on.

391
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,239
[Khloé] It's so sad.

392
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,041
Yeah.

393
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,779
[upbeat music]

394
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,222
{\an8}[Kris] Oh, look how cute they are!

395
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,157
-Look at my sheepy.
-[Khloé] That's cute.

396
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,560
There's an artist who made these things.

397
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,063
[Khloé] Oh, my God. This is crazy.

398
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,467
[Kris] It took me two years to find her,
but I haven't named her yet.

399
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,671
I don't really take
this scribe thing too seriously.

400
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,107
I think having a person follow you around

401
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,110
and type on a computer all day long
is a little excessive.

402
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:57,616
So... a little birdie told me that
you're upset about dinner the other night?

403
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:02,020
-[Kris] You have no filter.
-Everyone said that dinner was so fun.

404
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,923
Like, Kourtney and Kim were like,
"Thank God you were there." It was fun.

405
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,093
[Kris] You're always fun, but sometimes,
you take it to another level.

406
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,494
-And you have no filter.
-[keyboard keys clacking]

407
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,196
I wonder where I get the other level from?

408
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,099
[Khloé] You have a [bleep] scribe
dictating everything you do.

409
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,468
-I could replay it for you...
-[Kris] Oh, I can ask her

410
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,104
-and she can tell me exactly what we said.
-It's a visual, because...

411
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,674
it caught me off guard that you show up
with a scribe somewhere.

412
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,276
So what am I gonna do?

413
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,579
I'm gonna make a joke out of it
and make it uncomfortable,

414
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,848
because it's uncomfortable
to have someone going...

415
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,651
[keyboard keys clacking]

416
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,287
-Khloé, but that's what her job is.
-That's her job.

417
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:39,191
But it's also my job to show you
how ridiculous some things are.

418
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,927
-I wasn't trying to hurt your feelings.
-Okay.

419
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,862
I was trying to have fun
and be playful with you.

420
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,366
In the moment, you're laughing,
crying so much you're laughing.

421
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,167
I think I was really crying.

422
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,104
But then say, I would never want
to hurt your feelings, ever.

423
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,640
It's obviously all bull[bleep].
But that was the joke of it all.

424
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,176
You have
some ridiculous situation going on

425
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,779
with some person
dictating your every word.

426
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,749
No offense.
But you're a normal human being.

427
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,984
[Khloé]
We're not in the court of law here.

428
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,154
Okay, are we done with this conversation?

429
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,123
Yeah, I think we're done in general.

430
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,292
[upbeat music]

431
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,265
It's been really amazing
having the scribe around,

432
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,368
but I kind of get Khloé's point.

433
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:28,006
So I'm gonna lighten up
and do the same thing to her.

434
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:33,812
I think you're just as insane as she is.
And you wonder where she gets it from.

435
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,247
"Do unto others."

436
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,015
Good for you.

437
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:41,186
And that's not what it means,
"Do unto others."

438
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,889
"As you would have them do unto you."
Oh, yeah. You're right.

439
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,525
{\an8}-I was saying...
-[Kourtney] Hey, you guys.

440
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,693
{\an8}-You guys are matching.
-Khloé inspired me.

441
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,463
{\an8}I said, what are you wearing,
so I can throw something on.

442
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,266
{\an8}-[Khloé] I like your Good American skirt.
-I said, "I gotta represent."

443
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,001
{\an8}It looks so good and it feels so good.

444
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,603
[Kourtney] Do you want to be
the head of the table?

445
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,672
-[Larsa] Is Kylie coming?
-[Khloé] Yeah, right.

446
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,275
-Kylie's the new Rob.
-[Kourtney] The big boss.

447
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,645
-[Kim] Hey, Mom. Hey, Corey.
-Hi!

448
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,549
-[Kris] How are you?
-[Kendall] What is going on?

449
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,385
Oh, this is my scribe. This is Kendall.

450
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,220
[Kris] She writes down everything I say.

451
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,755
[Khloé] This person follows her
around everywhere.

452
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,623
Oh, my God.

453
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,393
-[Kris] Mm-hmm. Thank you.
-[Kourtney] Anybody? Brussels sprouts?

454
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,294
[Kim] Mm-hmm.

455
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,531
Do I need to leave a name at the gate
for a prescription delivery?

456
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,501
[Larsa] What are you getting?
Can we share?

457
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,503
Medication for Khloé's lice.

458
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,605
[Larsa] You have lice?

459
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,974
Kourt, she's trying to do
what I did at the restaurant.

460
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,211
-[Larsa] Khloé, I've been watching you...
-Could you go get the basket, babe?

461
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,513
-[Khloé] By preparation, each...
-So in case...

462
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,949
-[Kim] I love it.
-You've told me about your dryness problem

463
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,684
-in your vagina.
-My dry vagina. Yeah.

464
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,753
-So I got you K-Y Jelly. Yup.
-Thank you!

465
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,255
So she has this fungus.

466
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,091
-[Larsa] That's why she's been limping.
-[Khloé] For jock itch.

467
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,294
Mom, I actually have a dick.
This is perfect.

468
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,129
For your moustache.

469
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,066
-Kim will say I need this the most.
-[Kim] Yes.

470
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,969
-Here's your yeast infection medicine.
-I need that.

471
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:07,172
-This is for your colon health.
-[Khloé] Are you okay?

472
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,108
And I got you
high-waisted diapers this time.

473
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,610
Look at her, she's crying.

474
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,745
[indistinct chatter]

475
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,680
[laughter]

476
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:19,618
Going forward,
I think probably best to do the scribe

477
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:24,122
during meetings and business hours
and not family time maybe.

478
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,223
Okay.

479
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,927
[Kris] Okay. All right, Kourt,
I'll see you later.

480
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,197
[Kris sighs]
Bye, guys.

481
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,535
[chair creaking]

482
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,637
[soft scoff]

483
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,607
[upbeat music]

484
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,813
-Hi. How are you? I'm Kim.
-Hi! I'm Nury.

485
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,282
Nice to meet you. Sit down.

486
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:54,319
Thank you for expressing interest
on this issue that, you know,

487
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,255
quite frankly, has gotten so much worse
over the last,

488
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,924
I would say, five to ten years.

489
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,028
I had no idea. I mean,
my sisters and I had gone downtown.

490
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,329
It's shocking to see

491
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,864
-families and children.
-It really is shocking.

492
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,466
To me, it's infuriating
that we are, you know,

493
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:12,003
the most powerful country in the world
and that we allow people to live this way.

494
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,905
Yeah. That's so intense.

495
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:18,376
[Kim] Councilwoman Nury Martinez
has focused so much of her career

496
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,911
on helping the homeless.

497
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:23,148
What I want to know most
is what is the city doing to help.

498
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:28,119
'Cause that is what
will ultimately cure this issue.

499
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,323
So what we're trying to do is
not only address the housing needs,

500
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,526
but also the issue
of these large encampments

501
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,995
where you have, you know,
more than 50, 100 people.

502
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:41,366
But I want to show you a sort of a...
a glimpse of what my district looks like.

503
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,702
[Nury]
So this is what we call Cabrito Road

504
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,472
and it's literally a tent community.
You have all kinds of elements.

505
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,942
You have people who have, of course,
have serious drug addiction problems

506
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:51,943
that need treatment.

507
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,146
You have people who need medication
for their mental health issues.

508
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,583
But you also have a criminal element here
that nobody wants to talk about.

509
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,521
Sometimes you have pimps hiding, um,
young kids, as young as 11 year olds,

510
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:07,092
being trafficked in our country
every single day.

511
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,327
-[Nury] And, um, we do nothing.
-That's crazy.

512
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,063
Yeah, we do nothing to address this issue.
It's an epidemic.

513
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,600
It's hard to deal with it if you have
all the resources in the world.

514
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,569
[Nury] Right. In the city of Los Angeles,

515
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,839
we have to be very careful about
how we clean these encampments up.

516
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,608
Here's an indication of what sort of...
we find when we're there.

517
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:28,380
It's just the amount of stuff
that they accumulate over there for months

518
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,282
and they've been out there.
I mean, who can live this way?

519
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,550
[Kim] Yeah.

520
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:36,121
No one should ever live like this
in this country.

521
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,026
[Kim] I think the problem is just
so much bigger than people really realize.

522
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,228
You get, like, a glimpse of it,

523
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,764
but when you drive,
like, 20 minutes further,

524
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,898
you see...

525
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,200
it's, like, just like devastation

526
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:54,372
of like, people just all over the streets.
Like, people just have to see this.

527
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,575
Like, I want to drive down here.
I want to bring our cameras.

528
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,979
I want to show people what it's like
just right down the street.

529
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,448
-Ready?
-Yeah.

530
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,350
I'll follow you.

531
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,186
[upbeat music]

532
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,763
The homeless issue
is now starting to become

533
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,666
such a prevalent thing
all over, across the city.

534
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,235
I can't imagine
that people are not watching

535
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,837
these small encampments

536
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:29,641
kind of creep up in their neighborhood.
It's basically spreading everywhere.

537
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:34,379
I know that this is not something
that I could fix by myself,

538
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,614
but I hope
that everything that I'm learning

539
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,718
will hopefully wake something up
inside of other people,

540
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,920
so that everyone can just come together,

541
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:42,821
and...

542
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:48,860
You know, if me speaking about it
even brings awareness to one person,

543
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,963
then that can help make a difference.

544
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,300
[Nury] So this is all San Fernando Road,
along the railroad tracks.

545
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:02,907
{\an8}And this is probably one of our...
the most difficult encampment to clean up.

546
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,345
[Nury] And look at the trash
and the amount of debris, and...

547
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:15,487
So let's say you get out and you want
to talk to people, what would you say?

548
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,656
{\an8}Oh, I would just ask them if, um,
anybody from the HOPE Team,

549
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,026
{\an8}or from the city has approached them
about finding a place to live.

550
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,231
[Nury] If we see too many people out...

551
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,334
that doesn't seem like
it's gonna be a safe situation,

552
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,602
we can just stay in the car.

553
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,340
Sometimes they're willing
to talk to you, sometimes they're not.

554
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,408
[Kim] I can handle it.

555
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,213
I feel like we have a lot of people
around us, if something got crazy.

556
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,283
[Nury] Yeah, no, it actually gets
a little bit more dicier than that.

557
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,318
I just don't want to put you
in a situation.

558
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,992
[tense music]

559
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,794
-I'll just follow your lead.
-[Nury] All right. Let's go.

560
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,301
Look at this.
It looks like a third-world country.

561
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:05,937
[Nury] This used to be a lot worse camp.

562
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,439
This was all lined up with tents.

563
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,477
We've come out here a couple of times,
and as you can tell,

564
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,412
there's still some folks out here.

565
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,750
We're not trying to arrest anybody.
We're just simply trying to figure out,

566
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,787
how did you get here?
Are you willing to accept services?

567
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,256
[Nury] And then we'll bring in
the team to assess it.

568
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,929
[in Spanish] Hello, how are you?
What is your name?

569
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,197
[indistinct chatter]

570
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,465
-[Manuel] Manuel.
-Manuel, how long have you lived here?

571
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,502
-Two years.
-[Nury] Two years?

572
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,804
-This is my friend, Kim.
-<i>Hola.</i>

573
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,107
[Nury] Before you came here,
what was your job?

574
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,510
Before this, I worked with my brother
in a granite shop.

575
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,413
-Oh, where? Here?
-[Manuel] Around the corner over here.

576
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,414
[Nury] Uh-huh.

577
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,683
-Did you have a place to live before?
-Yes.

578
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,951
[Nury] Yes? What happened?

579
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,186
The company went broke

580
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,189
and we didn't have a chance
to look for other work.

581
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,091
Who lives here with you?

582
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,427
My wife lives here,
but she isn't here right now.

583
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,328
[Nury in English] Oh, okay.

584
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,631
So he's here with his wife
and he actually works around the corner

585
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,801
at a granite, um, crushing facility.
He, uh...

586
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,936
Two years ago, his company lost, um...

587
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,806
basically went bankrupt,
and he lost his job.

588
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,643
[in Spanish]
Has anyone come by to offer you services,

589
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,278
or help you find a place to live?

590
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,412
Honestly, no.

591
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:26,451
-And would you like to find some services?
-Who wouldn't? Because living here is...

592
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,152
-[Nury] It's hard, right?
-A little.

593
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,222
[Nury in English]
He said he's open to receiving services

594
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,790
or help to try to get off the street.

595
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,060
[Nury in Spanish] Thank you, Manuel.

596
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,098
Hello. How long have you lived here?

597
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,933
-Four months.
-[Nury] Four months?

598
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,135
-I'm from the streets.
-[Nury] Oh.

599
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,539
[in English] So the HOPE Team was out here
a couple of... a couple of months ago,

600
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,475
and so they did offer him services,

601
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,144
and he didn't accept it
about four months ago.

602
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,981
So, he doesn't really have a real,
an answer as to why, but this is...

603
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,716
He chose to stay out here.

604
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,785
[somber music]

605
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,057
The whole point is to try to get people
to accept the help.

606
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,293
But if you're not willing to,
it makes it harder.

607
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,094
[Kim] Yeah, for sure.

608
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,196
Walking through the encampment
and seeing the tents,

609
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,565
and just seeing that,
it's like this whole community.

610
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:18,236
It's just, you know, so unsanitary,
so not safe.

611
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,472
I don't know. It's just so...

612
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,709
It was, like, heartbreaking
to see these living conditions.

613
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,681
[Kim] Thank you so much
for taking the time to show it to me,

614
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,916
so it can, like, be really real.

615
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,285
We're gonna dive into it
and start meeting with people

616
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,020
and see what we can do to help.

617
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,889
-Okay. You're welcome.
-Thank you so much.

618
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,724
-[Kim] So nice to meet you.
-Same here.

619
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,793
[upbeat music]

620
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:51,769
{\an8}[indistinct chatter]

621
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,938
{\an8}-[Mason] Mom, can I have an Oreo?
-No.

622
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,508
-[Kourtney] You're very persistent but no.
-[Penelope] What do you want?

623
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,579
Eggies, a hotdog and...

624
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,915
-[Penelope] Pizza?
-Yeah.

625
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:09,821
So when we went downtown the other day,
there was, like, so many single moms.

626
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,858
-Yeah. It didn't seem like it was couples.
-It was so crazy. Yeah.

627
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,862
This one lady, when I was volunteering
at that homeless shelter,

628
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,163
she got injured at work.

629
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,400
And, like, the workers' comp
only covered so much

630
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,870
that, like, she had to like...
she was in the hospital for so long after,

631
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,772
she had to put
all of her money towards it.

632
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,776
And then when she was out of the hospital,
she just couldn't pay her bills.

633
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,277
'Cause she had no more money
and she couldn't work,

634
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,980
'cause she was disabled.
And then... so she had nowhere to go.

635
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,783
[Stephanie] She went to this,
like, transitional housing.

636
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,652
That's, like, where I told you
I was gonna volunteer for Mother's Day.

637
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,989
And they, like,
just give you a place to stay.

638
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,724
-Where is it?
-[Stephanie] Um...

639
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:51,796
It's, like, on the Eastside,
like, by my house. It's off of Alexandria.

640
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,297
I've heard of it, actually.

641
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,833
-[Stephanie] It's really cool. Yeah.
-[Kim] Alexandria House.

642
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,070
-The place is really cute.
-We have to go.

643
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,005
-[Stephanie] You guys should come.
-[Kim] Yeah.

644
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,441
-I'm sure they would be, like, so excited.
-[Kim] Yeah.

645
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,411
Oh, thank you.

646
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,379
[imitates sipping]

647
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,115
[upbeat music]

648
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,728
{\an8}[Kim] Hi. How are you?

649
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,197
{\an8}This is so cute.

650
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,566
{\an8}-Hey, Justine. How are you?
-[Justine] Hey, how are you?

651
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,002
{\an8}-Thank you for doing this.
-Oh, my gosh. Thanks for having me.

652
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,003
{\an8}It's so cool.

653
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:37,141
[Kim] Today, I have an amazing party
planned to support the Alexandria House,

654
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,878
a long-term shelter for women
and single moms.

655
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:45,416
We are partnering with companies
like Priv and Cost Plus World Market

656
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,785
to provide
some great products and services.

657
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,389
And I just want to bring awareness
to this issue

658
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:55,293
because I feel like there's a lot
that can be done in our community,

659
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,763
and it starts
with just getting the information.

660
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,900
{\an8}-Hi. How are you?
-Hi. I'm Caroline. How nice to meet you.

661
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,936
{\an8}-[Kim] Oh, of course. Of course.
-Come on over here.

662
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,039
{\an8}-[Kim] Hi. How are you?
-She's the director.

663
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,740
{\an8}-Nice to meet you.
-[Kim] Nice to meet you.

664
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,375
{\an8}Yeah, so glad that you're here.

665
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,645
Could I get everyone's attention
just for a moment, please?

666
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:21,285
Um, we just want to thank you, Kim,
for bringing your amazing crew here

667
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,620
for Alexandria House.

668
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,089
Alexandria House has been here
for 21 years.

669
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:28,726
As you know, LA is the homeless capital
of the United States.

670
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,796
[Caroline] The rising population
is women and children.

671
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,098
Alexandria House,
we're just a drop in the bucket

672
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,335
of what the good that we can do
to eliminate homelessness.

673
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,505
We really appreciate you being here
and casting some attention

674
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,341
on this incredible issue
that's impacting so many.

675
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:47,311
And what we'd like to offer to you
is a gift of stories.

676
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,980
[Judy] We'd like to start with Madisen.

677
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,682
{\an8}Most people don't understand,
you know, the homeless.

678
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,085
{\an8}They think that, oh,
you had to have been a bad kid.

679
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,755
You had to have run away.
You're doing drugs. I was an athlete.

680
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:03,461
Um, and for whatever reason,
my mom, she just couldn't deal.

681
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:07,165
She was on drugs,
and she kicked me out the house at 17,

682
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:11,002
and I found myself homeless
and I've met so many...

683
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:15,573
In my journey at 17 in the shelter,
I met so many kids who were like me.

684
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,010
So I just kinda wanted
to highlight that part of my story,

685
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,312
'cause most people
here in Alexandria House,

686
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,247
they know about the domestic violence
that I did.

687
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,317
They know that when I came here
at 20 years old with a one-year-old.

688
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,986
You know, they know
about that part of my story.

689
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,923
They don't know
what I went through before.

690
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,457
-[Madisen] So I just want to...
-Oh, wow.

691
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,459
Thank you so much for sharing your story.

692
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,428
[applause]

693
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,633
{\an8}I'm gonna do my signature piece.
It's called <i>Skid Row Sister.</i>

694
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,671
{\an8}It's a piece that I wrote
when I found myself on Skid Row.

695
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:52,877
<i>There's a place in LA
That's been titled obscure</i>

696
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:57,048
<i>It's a place I've embraced
As my gifts become sure</i>

697
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:02,787
<i>And in this space
I erase a lifetime of being demure</i>

698
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,525
<i>On the 17th of December
In the year of 2000</i>

699
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:11,862
<i>At 10:00 a.m.
I checked in to Skid Row Housing</i>

700
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:17,235
<i>Check all egos at the door
Because here humility comes</i>

701
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:21,572
<i>My Skid Row family
In spite of their insanity</i>

702
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,908
<i>Shows me undying support</i>

703
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:29,013
<i>Unlike those lames with my same last names</i>

704
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,949
<i>That said "Your dreams, you should abort"</i>

705
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:36,988
<i>Not to harp on the past
Because my losses are vast</i>

706
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,523
<i>Before you stands one completely broken</i>

707
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,693
<i>I love you, miss, and I love you, mister</i>

708
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,264
<i>Sincerely yours, a Skid Row sister</i>

709
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,632
[applause]

710
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,533
That was so beautiful.

711
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,603
[Angela] Thank you very much.

712
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,340
It's so important to understand

713
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,343
that not everyone on the street
is a drug addict.

714
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,747
People that I've met
are just having hardships.

715
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:06,450
Maybe they lost their job.
Maybe they just had a bad circumstance.

716
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,120
There's so many different stories,

717
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,721
and I think that's just...

718
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,724
the most important thing
is to get people off Skid Row.

719
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,628
Alexandria House is really helping me
with my life.

720
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:21,232
So I'm totally happy, but, you know,

721
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,435
I'm still homeless,
but I'm trying so hard.

722
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,505
And also, when I... Um...

723
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,875
Especially when I had my breast cancer,

724
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,311
I cannot... I cannot know what I'm doing.

725
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,380
-Don't cry.
-Thank you, Ms. Kim.

726
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,015
[Siti sobbing]

727
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,784
Thank you so much.

728
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:41,886
[Siti sniffles]

729
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:48,059
{\an8}We appreciate everything that you did
to make this happen

730
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:53,197
and also, really count on you to spread
the word on this issue of homelessness.

731
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,732
We appreciate you doing that.

732
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,400
I just want to say
thank you for having me.

733
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,537
And I know this is, like, a lot
to share your stories,

734
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:05,343
and I think it'll help so many people
just put a different face on homelessness,

735
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:09,447
'cause I think that so many people
just have such an idea

736
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,316
of what that looks like,
and it's really so different.

737
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,619
And so many people that are
just a paycheck away from being homeless.

738
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,523
So I appreciate you guys
for sharing your stories with us.

739
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,361
And, you know, today,
I just wanted to pamper you guys.

740
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:28,933
We have people inside that are gonna
talk to you about money management

741
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,169
and things that I wish they taught
in high school and in schools

742
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,105
that they just never really teach you,

743
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:38,309
and women in there
to help you write résumés for jobs.

744
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,411
It's just a pampering day

745
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,880
because you guys
really all deserve it so much.

746
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,950
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

747
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,319
There's so many organizations,

748
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,655
but the epidemic
is just growing so much that...

749
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,327
you know, every organization
just needs more resources.

750
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,297
[woman] So what we're gonna end up doing
is moving work experience to the top.

751
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,300
This is our after-school program
and we have a day care

752
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,370
in this building, also,
on this floor in the bottom floor.

753
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:10,708
{\an8}I mean, the problem is just so big
that it's not gonna take, you know,

754
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,144
{\an8}just one person saying
they want to make a difference.

755
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,081
{\an8}It's gonna take, like, the whole city
and the country coming together

756
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,483
to fix this huge issue.

757
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,020
[woman] All right, one, two, three.

758
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:23,954
{\an8}[Kim] <i>Next on...</i>

759
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,991
{\an8}-Oh, my God!
-[dog barks]

760
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:30,194
{\an8}-[Kim] She sleeps with the dogs.
-Kim, yours really makes a lot of noise.

761
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,563
{\an8}Kourtney's does not bark.
I want to go swap.

762
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,798
{\an8}[Kourtney] Give me my dog.

763
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,032
{\an8}[Kim] Guess who this is.

764
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,669
{\an8}I literally, once a week, have a stalker.

765
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,438
{\an8}I want to protect myself.

766
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,974
{\an8}I'm not comfortable with it.
I wouldn't want my kids around it.

767
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,343
{\an8}I wouldn't want the kids here,
and I know there's a gun.

768
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,647
{\an8}I want to feel comfortable around a gun.
