{\an8}[upbeat music]

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,343
{\an8}[Josh] Hey!

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,779
-How are you?
-Good to see you. Mwah.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,847
-So long.
-I know.

5
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,782
{\an8}[Khloé] Tristan and I were just,
like, on Zillow.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,218
We found this. I told Kim.
That's why she wants to see it.

7
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,021
Well, come on in.
I don't have to really give you the tour.

8
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,689
-[Kim] What a good house.
-Cool, huh?

9
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,657
-[Khloé] Gonna buy it?
-[Kim] No.

10
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:29,963
Khloé saw that my house
that I owned years ago is up for sale,

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,665
and I would love to see it.

12
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,601
There are so many memories in this house.

13
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,736
[Kim] My mirror!

14
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,371
[Khloé] Oh, my God.
They really did keep everything.

15
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,773
[Kim] They kept everything.

16
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,141
[Josh] We sold it fully furnished,
remember?

17
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,576
-That bowl wasn't mine.
-[Khloé laughs]

18
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,480
It's just a fun opportunity
to relive all those memories

19
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,150
and see the house
before someone else bought it.

20
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,020
So, this is where Mom and I got into
the food fight with the cupcakes.

21
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,855
[Kris] I am so proud of you.

22
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:59,392
You're showing off your little cupcake,
and I think...

23
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,795
[laughter]

24
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,696
[Kris] Really? Really?

25
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,833
You don't wanna mess with me, bitch!

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,101
The memories, Kokes.

27
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,370
As long as you got your tits in there,
it's a good video.

28
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,274
[Kim] This is my same exact bedding,
you guys.

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,977
Oh, my God, this is where
I dropped Mason once.

30
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,780
[Khloé] What? Don't Snapchat
that you dropped Mason.

31
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,749
-[Josh chuckles]
-It was no big deal. I caught him.

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,152
[Khloé] Kim, you've got to go
see your glam room.

33
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,755
Oh, my God, my logos are still on it.

34
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,091
[Khloé] Tell me that's not amazing.

35
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,160
[Kim] This is where they TP'd my house.
Do you remember?

36
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,696
-[Khloé] Oh, [bleep]. When you got so mad.
-TP'd the whole front.

37
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,800
This is like an art form.

38
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:41,935
[Jonathan gasps]

39
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,537
-[Kim] I am so pissed.
-Now you're gonna be even more pissed.

40
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,207
-[Jonathan] This is, like...
-I don't find this funny. On my roses?

41
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,311
[Khloé] I've never seen someone
get so mad off of a...

42
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,779
Like, that's, like you're not being...

43
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,947
Was I pregnant or something?

44
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,483
-[Khloé] No, you were just a bitch.
-[Josh laughs]

45
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,551
[theme music]

46
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,542
{\an8}[Khloé] Kourtney, you're so tiny,
it makes no sense.

47
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,312
{\an8}-I need to just...
-And that's your skin color from Egypt.

48
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,081
{\an8}Would you lay out less?

49
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,115
What are you doing?

50
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,518
-You have a little black dot.
-[Khloé] Well, she's not done.

51
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,585
Freak.

52
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,753
[Kourtney] So...

53
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,455
Um...

54
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,391
What the [bleep] are you trying to say?
Spit it out.

55
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,261
[Kourtney] I was just gonna tell you
about my conversation with Corey.

56
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,962
[Khloé] Oh, when he said something to you?

57
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,330
[Larsa] But wait, why?
What happened with you, Khlo?

58
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,465
What happened? Like, you guys have...

59
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,668
Nothing happened to me,
and I haven't talked [bleep].

60
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,137
Like, I've never been rude to him.
Like, we were, like, cool.

61
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,107
And then he said something
to Malika at this concert,

62
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,275
and he was like,

63
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,977
"You know, there's that one sister
who hates me."

64
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,046
[tense music]

65
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,316
-Lik was like, "This guy is..."
-Where's this coming from? Yeah.

66
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,619
[Khloé] Right. But he's such a baby,
like, you're making this a bigger scene.

67
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,889
It's like, you talk [bleep] about me
to Malika, who's gonna tell me.

68
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,659
You talk [bleep] about me to Kourtney,
who's gonna tell me.

69
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,627
[Khloé] He makes me very uncomfortable.

70
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,763
When Corey and my mom started dating,

71
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,166
I was definitely skeptical just because

72
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,468
my mom just got out of a 24-year marriage,

73
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,037
and I was just being protective.

74
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,239
[Khloé] But I thought Corey and I
have been fine.

75
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,442
And now I'm hearing that Corey's
been talking [bleep] about me?

76
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,978
Why would you not wanna
get along with your...

77
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,613
-with your girlfriend's daughter?
-Whatever we are.

78
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,648
Yeah. It's so weird.

79
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,952
Like, that attitude is so [bleep] lame.

80
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,187
-Yeah.
-It's like, well, you should care.

81
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,924
If you're dating my mom, you should care
if her kids like you or not.

82
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,262
[upbeat music]

83
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,667
{\an8}-Who wears a short-sleeve fur jacket?
-[Kim] Sell that.

84
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,603
Mom, sell that right away.

85
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,472
Mom, do you like that quinceñera bag?

86
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,540
-This?
-[Khloé] Yeah.

87
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,543
-That is cheeseball.
-[Kris] It is the coolest beach bag.

88
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,745
It's so cute with my black bathing suit

89
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,046
and my little black cover-up

90
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,115
-and my black Chanel sandals.
-Okay.

91
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,718
[Khloé] I get it. I have things
none of you guys like, either.

92
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,786
Oh, ain't that the truth.

93
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,788
-[laughing]
-[Kris] All right, you guys.

94
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,392
So, I need to find something
to wear to this thing Saturday night

95
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,994
where I could wear this.

96
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,028
[Khloé] Why?

97
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,565
Because I have the biggest earlobes
in the universe.

98
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,534
[quirky music]

99
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,236
[Khloé] Mom, you're just being dramatic.

100
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,872
First of all, you don't have big earlobes,
and now you're nitpicking.

101
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,642
-[Kris] I am not nitpicking.
-So wear, like, a headband or something.

102
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,878
[Kim] Maybe you can add some
hair extensions to cover your ears.

103
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,180
-[Kris] Love.
-[Khloé] Mom, are you for real?

104
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,715
I am for real.

105
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,485
[laughs]
I got to cover my ears.

106
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,720
-No, you don't.
-[Kris] I could do this.

107
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,023
You're just not a beanie kind of girl.

108
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,825
You need to be more glam,
which is, like, a turban-y type of thing.

109
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,527
[Kris] Okay, who knows how to do a turban?

110
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,562
[Khloé] Didn't you learn anything
from the prince of India?

111
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,164
[Kris] No, I can't figure it out.

112
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,034
When I used to sit and watch Grandma Lou
do her makeup,

113
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,568
she had these big earlobes,

114
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,071
and I learned that your nose and your ears

115
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,506
keep growing your whole life.

116
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,641
I don't think your ears
are that bad at all,

117
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,476
especially with those
big diamond studs you wear.

118
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,512
Is that why you wear diamonds that big,
to hide your ears?

119
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,782
I can't afford for my diamonds
to get any bigger. Okay?

120
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,250
[Kris] I bought these earrings.

121
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,987
When I put 'em on. I couldn't wear 'em.
They hung like two cow udders.

122
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,889
-They were horrible.
-<i>♪ Do your ears hang low? ♪</i>

123
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,124
-<i>♪ Do they wobble to and fro? ♪
-♪ To and fro? ♪</i>

124
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,026
All I want is just cute ears.

125
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,495
I really like to look my best
at all times,

126
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,399
and ever since Kim made a comment
about my ears,

127
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,500
I've always wondered.

128
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,470
And now I'm looking
in the mirror obsessively.

129
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,339
Like, are they... are they too big?

130
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,207
And what was she talking about?

131
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,777
But I think that the decision
to do something

132
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,147
about my ever-changing ears...

133
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,383
[laughs]
...is suddenly a priority.

134
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,752
I play with them all day, they're so big.

135
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,854
They're, like, flapping.

136
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,389
-[Kourtney] Oh, my God.
-Ew.

137
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,524
I'm so worried about your ears.

138
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,493
[laughs]
My ears.

139
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,595
-Oh, my God.
-[laughs]

140
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,231
-If you just did this.
-I get it.

141
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,500
Is this like a whole new woman?

142
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,402
[Kourtney] Khloé, what do you...

143
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,870
[laughing]

144
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,273
[upbeat music]

145
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,079
It is lit with this choker.

146
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,883
{\an8}[Kourtney] My lower back hurts so much.

147
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,152
My knee kills from [bleep] SoulCycle,

148
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,088
but my left knee,
the knee that's never had surgery.

149
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,390
[sighs]

150
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,625
I'm so tired.

151
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,327
[Khloé] This is gonna be a fun workout.

152
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,063
-[Kourtney] Why?
-[Khloé] Just feel sluggish.

153
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,465
[Kourtney] Did you go out last night?

154
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,200
No. Did not go out.

155
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,969
-[Kourtney] Did you drink?
-[Khloé] Nope.

156
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,505
[Kourtney] Did you eat breakfast?

157
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,206
I don't really eat breakfast.

158
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,808
-Hi, Joe.
-Good morning, girls.

159
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,009
-Hi.
-How you doing?

160
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,210
[Khloé] I did the stairs.

161
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,712
Kourtney just sat here

162
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,647
-and did lazy stretching.
-[Kourtney] Stretching.

163
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,150
[Khloé] But anyway, on to the next.

164
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,718
On to the next.

165
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,453
-[Kourtney] What are we doing?
-[Joe] Crunches.

166
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,956
Stay on the floor, grab your arm,
and lift me everything

167
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,224
by keeping your arm...

168
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,126
That's it. Breathe out.

169
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,662
Is this supposed to hurt my lower stomach?

170
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,997
-Nope.
-No?

171
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,698
No. You feel it like the...

172
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,467
-Like, pulling. Yeah.
-You feel the tension?

173
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,836
-Like, I've never felt that before.
-This one... This one is more.

174
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,371
Well, if you never felt it before,

175
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,040
then it's safe to say
you're not supposed to feel it.

176
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,241
Should I just do regular?

177
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,710
-Like, small crunches.
-[Kourtney] What should I do?

178
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,347
Do the thing you were
supposed to be doing.

179
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,817
[panting]

180
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,885
[upbeat music]

181
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,359
[Khloé] Lately, I have been
so sluggish and bloated

182
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,128
and Tristan keeps teasing me

183
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,696
'cause he keeps saying,
"Oh, I think you're pregnant."

184
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,598
He keeps putting his hand on my tummy.

185
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,934
And it's not far-fetched, it's just...

186
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,303
I'm not pregnant.

187
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,537
There's no way.

188
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,606
[upbeat music]

189
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,512
[upbeat music]

190
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,383
{\an8}[Khloé] Alexa!

191
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,418
[Alexa] Yeah.

192
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,720
{\an8}[Khloé] Um...

193
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,125
Oh, my God.

194
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,661
-[Alexa] Like, there are two lines.
-Yeah.

195
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,163
[Khloé] Clear as day.

196
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,031
I am pregnant.

197
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,835
-[Alexa] No.
-Yeah.

198
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,071
-[Alexa] No, you're not.
-No, I am.

199
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,706
And I felt that I was.

200
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,474
-[Alexa] You've been saying it.
-I know.

201
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,477
And you said you were in the shower
and you had to sit down.

202
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,812
Oh, my God, yes.

203
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,413
After my workout was the first...

204
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,582
I've never felt that tired in my life.

205
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,818
-That's so weird.
-It's so crazy.

206
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,788
I'm pregnant.
[laughs]

207
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,358
I'm super nervous but really excited.

208
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:48,494
There's a million different emotions
that are going on in my brain,

209
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,162
but I think I'm in a state of shock.

210
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,732
I almost can't believe it,
but in good shock.

211
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,768
[Khloé] Tristan and I have always
discussed that in August

212
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,572
we would start trying having kids
and I would get off birth control.

213
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,909
I ended up getting off birth control
a few months before

214
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,343
because I met Dr. Huang.

215
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,779
[Dr. Huang] There's a possibility that you
being on the pills as long as you have

216
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,347
-has kind of suppressed your ovaries...
-[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

217
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,149
...and not let me see
all the other follicles.

218
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,684
-So get off the pills.
-[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

219
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,887
{\an8}And if we do that, and, uh,
things look great, awesome.

220
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,222
{\an8}If things don't look good,

221
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,292
{\an8}definitely consider getting
some of these maybe in the freezer.

222
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:24,297
It's the weirdest, best, craziest
just... [bleep].

223
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,531
[chuckles]

224
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,734
-Did you call Tristan?
-[Khloé] Yeah.

225
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,204
When he answered the phone, I was,
like, holding this, like, just that.

226
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,274
I'm, like, shaking, and he was like,
"What? I can't see anything."

227
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,578
I was like, "[bleep] look at the thing!"
He's like, "It says 'poor connection.'"

228
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,480
I was like, "[bleep],"
'cause he's in Toronto.

229
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,715
-Oh, my God.
-[Khloé] So he has no service.

230
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,016
And I was like, "I'm pregnant."

231
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,953
He was like, "Oh, my God." He's like,
"Wait, are you kidding or serious?"

232
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,488
I was like, "No, I'm serious."
And then I started crying.

233
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,891
He said, "Are you crying?"
And I was like, "I'm crying."

234
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,626
I was like,
"I don't know what's happening."

235
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,494
-Oh, my God.
-Because we've said...

236
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,697
-He's been wanting this.
-I know.

237
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,398
Like, we put it in the universe.

238
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,668
-So, like, this is like a blessing.
-[Khloé] It's crazy.

239
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,904
It's totally a blessing.
It's just really real.

240
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,539
I can't believe you're pregnant.

241
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,008
I know. It's so real.

242
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,977
Can you call your sisters?

243
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,279
-No. I don't want anyone to know.
-Okay.

244
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,681
Because I want to tell them,
like, with Tristan.

245
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,583
-Yeah.
-And then, weirdly,

246
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,685
Tristan's whole family is coming here.

247
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:24,924
So my mom was already planning
on having a barbecue at her house,

248
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,158
-so that's...
-So that's perfect.

249
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,760
Yeah, she was already doing that,

250
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,429
so I just figure,
let's piggyback onto that.

251
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:34,266
I would love to tell everyone at one time
so no one feels, like...

252
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,836
-[Alexa] Yeah.
-...we told one before the other.

253
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:40,272
I think it's just gonna be
so hard not to tell, like, anyone.

254
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,008
I actually can't believe you're pregnant.

255
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,011
-[laughter]
-I can't believe I'm pregnant either.

256
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,014
[both laughing]

257
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,616
[upbeat music]

258
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,988
Don't we look like real sisters right now?

259
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,157
-[Kim] Hi.
-[Jason] Hi, guys.

260
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,525
{\an8}-Great to see you again.
-[Kim] How are you? Good to see you.

261
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,761
{\an8}-How are you? Good to see you.
-Good. How are you?

262
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,263
-I'm Kris. Nice to see you.
-Hi, Kris, it's so nice to meet you.

263
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,631
-Nice to meet you.
-How are you?

264
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,000
-Good. Really good.
-I'm so glad you guys are here.

265
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:12,271
So, I have a practice in Moscow,
and Dubai, and New York,

266
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,907
so I see everybody
from all over the world.

267
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,577
[Jason] I get the requests to look,
you know, people bring pictures.

268
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,980
I mean, I get Angelina
and I get Megan Fox,

269
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,582
-but you are the number one person...
-No way.

270
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,517
[Jason] Number one.

271
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,652
Is she gonna do the picture thing?

272
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,154
[Jason] You wanna put
your face in the camera?

273
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,691
We can put you on the computer
and show you what I see.

274
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,725
[Kris] Yeah.

275
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,896
Dr. Jason Diamond
is a world-renowned surgeon

276
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,566
who specializes
in plastic surgery of the face.

277
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,869
So I know he'll be able to help me
with my earlobes

278
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:47,139
and get everything kind of moved up
to the right place.

279
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,009
[Jason] So, there's some
very straightforward things

280
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,877
that can make a big difference.

281
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,313
-[Kris] Thank you, God.
-[Jason] So, what we do

282
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,584
is cut out a wedge of tissue
that looks something like this.

283
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,453
-[Kris shudders]
-[Jason] So, all that is gone.

284
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,923
And it just brings this up like this.

285
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,059
The procedure takes about 30 minutes.

286
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,828
It looks good in three days.

287
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,496
[Jason] You would love it. It'd be great.

288
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,732
[Kris] Yeah. Who even knew
you could do that?

289
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,668
[Jason] That alone will take five,
ten years off of you.

290
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,802
Just the earlobe reduction.

291
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,838
[Kris] Like, my earlobes
are out of control.

292
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,373
[Jason] Yeah, you know,
it's a common saying, as we get older,

293
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,376
-our nose and our earlobes grow, so...
-[Kris] It's so annoying.

294
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,814
[upbeat music]

295
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,255
{\an8}[Kim] I love it out here.

296
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,657
It's very nice and relaxing.

297
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,792
[Khloé] Hi, Goober.

298
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,628
Goober. Goober.

299
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,697
Then she's gonna go over there
and you're gonna say,

300
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,365
"Why is the dog over here?"

301
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,733
[Khloé] But you called her name.

302
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,535
-Oh, hi, Goober.
-[chuckles]

303
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,737
Gabbana Goober. Let's see your teeth.

304
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,739
Why is that so funny for... to you?

305
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:54,840
[Kim] I don't know.

306
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,941
[Khloé] Stay.

307
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,443
-[Gabbana panting]
-[Khloé] Good girl.

308
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,045
[gasps]
Oh, my goodness!

309
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,313
[Tristan] What's up, what's up, what's up?

310
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,716
-I thought North was here.
-Hello, everybody. Hello, everybody.

311
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,417
[Kim] Let's cue the cute music.

312
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,519
{\an8}[both groan]

313
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,587
{\an8}[romantic music]

314
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,588
[Khloé] I love you.

315
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,827
-Let's cue the romantic music.
-[Khloé] It's been two weeks!

316
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,830
-Really? Two weeks?
-[Khloé] He's been gone for two weeks!

317
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,765
A week and a half. Nine days.

318
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,468
That's so cute
that you still get so excited.

319
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,004
"Still"? We've only known each other
for a year.

320
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,606
-That's true. It is a year.
-I know. I'm like, "Oh, hey."

321
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,710
Kim doesn't know that
this is the first time I'm seeing Tristan

322
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,147
since we confirmed that I am pregnant,

323
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,050
and we're both so excited
and happy about it.

324
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,687
[Khloé] Also, Tristan and Alexa
are really the only two people

325
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,955
that know that I'm pregnant,

326
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,257
so having Tristan back in town,

327
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,593
and I could share just how I'm feeling

328
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,930
or, like, my nerves or my excitement,
it makes me feel really good.

329
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,766
So it's good to have
my support system back here.

330
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,468
-She's asking you to rub her stomach.
-[Kim] I know.

331
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,237
-[Khloé] She's persistent.
-[Tristan] Mm-hmm.

332
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,205
[Khloé] Ah...

333
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,841
-[Tristan] Wow. I'ma be honest...
-[Kim high-pitched squeaking]

334
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,609
[Tristan laughs]

335
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,878
Well, I'm gonna go, uh, use the bathroom.

336
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,813
When you're done,
I wanna come and bother you.

337
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,548
That's fine. I'm waiting for that.

338
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,550
-[Kim] She loves it.
-I'm waiting for that.

339
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,119
Gabbana, I was very generous.

340
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,355
[Kim] You have great teeth, Gabbana.

341
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,457
-[laughing]
-[Kim] She does.

342
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,493
-[Khloé] She has great teeth?
-[Kim] Very, like, straight teeth.

343
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,897
Thank God, or you would probably
make me give her dental surgery.

344
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,132
[upbeat music]

345
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,970
[Khloé vocalizes]

346
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,145
{\an8}[Khloé] Okay, your breathing,
you've got to chill.

347
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,114
Like, you're breathing so hard.

348
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:47,186
Khlo. What is the stick that is shoved
so far up your ass

349
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,788
and your vagina at the same time?

350
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,990
You need to lighten up.

351
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,426
[Kourtney] You have a permanent attitude
every day.

352
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,096
[Khloé] I don't think so to other people
'cause no one else says it.

353
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,597
-[Kourtney] Not to anyone else.
-Oh, to you.

354
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,532
-It's the way you even look at me...
-I know.

355
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,800
...is, like, atrocious.

356
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,102
It's not atrocious.

357
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,437
I just feel like you and I are not vibing.

358
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,072
-But guess what?
-You don't care.

359
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,507
-[Kourtney] We're soul sisters.
-Oh.

360
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,676
-No, I don't not care.
-I was gonna say, "That's nice."

361
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,877
You little [bleep] whore.

362
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,512
[Kourtney] Every time I see you,

363
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,282
you just stare me down
in, like, an evil way.

364
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,816
[Kim] How was Poppy?

365
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:21,153
Kendall was there,
and, uh, the basketball player was there.

366
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,389
[Kourtney]
But I look over and I see, like,

367
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,659
a Black guy sitting there
with a bottle of 1942,

368
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:27,726
like, holding it,

369
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,561
-just sitting like this.
-[Kim] For dear life?

370
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,830
No, but I was like, "Is that Corey?"

371
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,667
He shaved his beard
so he looks totally different.

372
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,968
[Kourtney] Then I talked to him.

373
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,703
I'm like, "Are you coming
to the barbecue?"

374
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,105
[Kourtney] And he was like,
"Uh, I don't think so."

375
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,341
-Why? We're planning on this.
-Like, you know, just like,

376
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,310
"Seeing everyone, it's, like, hard."
And then I was like...

377
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,412
-Who?
-[Khloé] Seeing everyone is hard?

378
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,580
Like, "Everyone, like,
they don't like me,"

379
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,882
-or whatever, and I'm like...
-[Khloé] Who doesn't like him?

380
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,185
Tell him to answer the...
Spit it out, Corey, and be direct.

381
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,186
I know, so I said,

382
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,189
"Khloé was just telling me
how she feels like you hate her."

383
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,592
He's like, "I just know what people,
like, think about me," or whatever.

384
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,529
[Khloé] I've never given a sprinkle
of that energy.

385
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,463
Same.

386
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,799
[Khloé] You should say,
"Khloé would like to talk to you."

387
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,901
-Do you want me to text him that?
-Yeah.

388
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,104
Tristan and I have this really huge
barbecue coming up,

389
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,840
and I know Corey will probably be there,

390
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,443
and I don't want there to be
any weird tension.

391
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,814
[Khloé] I want everything
to be peaceful and enjoyable.

392
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,318
And, plus, I really don't want my mom
to be stressed about any potential drama

393
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,153
between her boyfriend and her daughter.

394
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,390
{\an8}[line ringing]

395
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,125
{\an8}-[Khloé] Oh.
-[Kim] You're FaceTiming him?

396
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,226
-No, no, don't FaceTime.
-[Kourtney] Why?

397
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,795
-We said text him.
-Shh! Just say, okay.

398
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,330
Just say, "Khloé would love to see..."

399
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,699
Oh, my God, you're making this
so awkward now.

400
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,368
Oh, my God, why would you do that?

401
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,004
{\an8}-[Corey] <i>Yo.</i>
-Hi.

402
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,874
Come to the barbecue
'cause Khloé wants to talk to you.

403
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,710
[whispering]
Nicely. Nice, like in a nice way.

404
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,212
[Kourtney] Nicely.

405
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,381
Khloé wants to talk to you nicely.

406
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,249
She would love for you to be there.

407
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,518
[Kourtney] Did you hear me?

408
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,786
[Corey] <i>You're not even saying...</i>

409
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,755
Here, I'll text you.
The connection is bad.

410
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:03,989
-[Corey] <i>All right.</i>
-Okay, bye.

411
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:10,662
I am so nervous to talk to Corey
about any of our weird problems

412
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:11,697
that we have together.

413
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,667
I mean, Tristan and I are going through
a lot of changes right now.

414
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:19,004
I want him at the barbecue
to hear our announcement.

415
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,173
But we just don't need any extra drama.

416
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,208
I don't even know
what the drama is anymore.

417
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,144
I'm... It's, like, crazy.

418
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,416
I'm going to Kendall
and Kylie's gynecologist.

419
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,285
I just wanted you guys all to know that.

420
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,453
-Good.
-[Kim] That's exciting.

421
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,854
Spicing up my life.

422
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,026
[upbeat music]

423
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,100
{\an8}[Kourtney] You have a red dot of lipstick
randomly up here.

424
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,971
It might be necessary
to look in the mirror.

425
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,509
[Khloé] Have you ever been
this hot in your life?

426
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,411
Ugh, I'm literally sweating.

427
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,414
-I'd like to try one of these.
-[Khloé] They're a little sour.

428
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,718
Golden berries.

429
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,188
[Kourtney] That's so much sugar.

430
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:13,625
Last night, I had rice, chicken,
brussels sprouts, carrots.

431
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,394
[Kourtney] What do you eat for dinner?

432
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,763
Last night, I had an artichoke.

433
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,998
And you think that's good?

434
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,134
-[Khloé] What?
-Where's your protein?

435
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,169
It's some in an artichoke.

436
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,270
Is there?

437
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,506
Yeah, I Googled the nutritional value.

438
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,908
Get off my dick for two seconds.

439
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,144
So, where does it all go wrong?
[chuckles]

440
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,580
[Kourtney] What are you eating?
Are you snacking?

441
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,647
So, you think I'm fat.

442
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,217
No, but I think you've gained
a few pounds.

443
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,120
-You think that? Since when?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

444
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,087
I don't know.

445
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,156
Since Tristan's been back.

446
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,959
Haven't you guys amped up the eating
since he's been back?

447
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:47,893
Probably.

448
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,562
[Kourtney] That's not a bad thing.

449
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,798
-Well...
-[Kourtney] Got to live life.

450
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,400
[Khloé] I know I'm bigger.
What do you want me to do?

451
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,469
[tense music]

452
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,307
[Kourtney] I could tell you a few small
tips that would just help you instantly.

453
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,943
-[coughing]
-[Kourtney] Just a healthier way

00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,714
Are you okay?

-You have stuff all on your teeth.
-Stop.

-[Khloé] No.

Just stop hitting me just one minute.

-[nurse] How are you?

-You guys, was I supposed to not eat?

No, it's okay, 'cause you're doing local.

-Yeah, Kim just wrote me and said,

She's coming here in a minute.

"I would get you something,

478
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,672
but you can't eat." I'm like...

479
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,273
Well, let's not eat anything else.

480
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,744

or because I'm doing this procedure?"

Hello! How are you?

482
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,883
[Jason] Wide awake, so if anything bothers
you at all, you'll just say, "Hey..."

-[Kim] Hello.
-You won't feel a thing.

-Wide awake.
-[Jason] Yeah, just a little local.

so I'll stay here.

-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

491
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,170
I'm a little nervous.
They're gonna give me a Valium.

492
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,771
-You're nervous?
-Mm-hmm.

493
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,007
[Jason] Let's see
if we can make some marks first.

494
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,842
And if this hurts at all, tell me.

495
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,546
Oh, my God, can you believe
you're cutting your [bleep] ears off?

496
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,381
You piece of [bleep].

497
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,550
You are really mean.

498
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:52,784
That's so mean.

499
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,419
No, I just... Like, it hit me.

500
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:58,090
I was, like, staring at your ear,
and I'm like, "Holy [bleep]."

501
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:01,126
My whole goal this morning
was to try not to focus

502
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,729
-on what the actual procedure was...
-[Kim] Okay.

503
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,998
-...and just chill into the Valium.
-[Kim] It's chill.

504
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,001
I am going to go into the other room.
This is my cue.

505
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,869
-But I'll be right out there.
-Mm-hmm.

506
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,903
Chilling.

507
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,806
-[Kim] Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

508
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,075
-Good luck.
-[Kris] Thank you.

509
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,911
[Jason] After this,
you're not gonna feel anything.

510
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,079
[device whirring]

511
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,048
[Jason] This is, like,
the worst one right here.

512
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:24,783
Good.

513
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,985
And right here too.

514
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,956
[Kim] Watching this is crazy
and very uncomfortable,

515
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,190
but you know what?

516
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,191
Do what you got to do.

517
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,828
If you have to cut half your ear off,
all good.

518
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,463
I'm here to support you.

519
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,032
[Jason] Kris, you're done.

520
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,867
[Kris] Oh, my gosh.

521
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,168
[Jason] It was easy, right?

522
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,671
[Kris] You know, it's wild.
I never felt a thing.

523
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,874
-I'm excited. Thank you so much.
-[Jason] You're welcome.

524
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,609
I really appreciate it.

525
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,444
[Kim] Your ear looks like
a normal ear now.

526
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,313
-Do you want a comb?
-[Kris] No.

527
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,149
I put it in my will that I have to always
have my hair done

528
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,484
-if I'm, like... cannot...
-[Jason chuckles]

529
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:03,021
-...talk to myself or, like, communicate.
-[Kris] Yeah.

530
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,791
[Kim] Mom, I'll make sure
that your hair's always done.

531
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,059
[Kris] Thank you.

532
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,095
If you don't know your name,
you'll have great hair.

534
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,039
{\an8}-[Kim] Hey, you look cute.
-[Kris] Thank you.

535
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,576
Hi! How's my little girl?

536
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,079
-[Kim] How are your ears?
-[Kris] I don't know.

537
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,214
[Kim] They look great,
and they look way better.

538
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,615
You're so cute.

539
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,117
[Kourtney] You did it, Mase.

540
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:34,920
-[Reign] Mom...
-[Kourtney] Wanna come up?

541
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,188
Yes.

542
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,390
-Hi, Mama.
-Hi, baby.

543
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,624

560
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,427
You dressed up.

561
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,928
So did you.

562
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,364
-[Kim] Not really. Will you introduce me...
-Oh, Yeezus is here?

563
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,665
...to Tristan's mom?

564
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,534
Kim said you weren't gonna be here.

565
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,536
So, guess what, this is a big day.

566
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,738
[Kim] I wasn't sure, so...

567
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,541
[Khloé] Hi. You look cute.
Hi, Corey. You look nice.

568
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,644
Oh, the Lord got a haircut!

And he brought the big dog.

This thing's a puppy.

[Khadijah] That thing is not a puppy.

572
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,152
Krissy, you have so many grandkids now,
it's crazy.

573

[Kris] No.

Do you want something to drink, Khlo?

579
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,899
[Khloé] No, I'm okay, Mom.

-[Kris] Are you sure?
-[Khloé] Yeah.

Like, do we bring out the cake?

583
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,640
Are you just... are we just
gonna say, "We have an announcement"?

"We are gathered here to, to ascertain..."

-You're gonna lead it.
-[Tristan] Huh?

-You lead it.
-I'm gonna lead it, then you'll finish.

587
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,283
[Tristan] I'll lead, be like,
"Thank you, guys, you know,

588
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,784
-for coming..."
-Okay.

589

"Taking time out
of your guys' busy schedule."

00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,087
"Thank you, guys, for coming." Okay.

"It's perfect timing."

00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,058
Okay, I'm getting anxiety, like, a lot.

00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,260
-[Tristan] And then...
-Oh, my God.

594
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,963
-[Tristan] Then we throw the hammer down.
-Okay.

Tristan and I are so nervous
to tell everyone.

I mean, we both don't know
what the hell we're doing,

597
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:35,106
but we're super excited and we're so lucky
and blessed to have everybody here.

00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,710
[Khloé] Can we get everyone
from the cabana to the table?

Okay. Come on. Come on, Scott.

for all coming.

for being 30 minutes late.

602

-Thank you for being honest.
-Um...

Mama Kris, thank you
for allowing us to come.

that my family's here

and all your family's here
to unite as one.

that I think anyone could ever tell me.

656
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,294
[Khloé] I'm happy that I get to talk
about it now with my sisters,

657
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,129
and my mom was just so emotional.

658
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,530
This is literally her dream

659
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,600
'cause she nudges me every day
about freezing my [bleep] eggs.

660
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,903
So, feel really blessed.

661
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,772
Hey.

662
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,906
{\an8}[Kendall] <i>Hi.</i>

663
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,942
{\an8}[Khloé] I'm having a baby.

664
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,011
-<i>No, you're not.</i>
-No, I am.

665
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,245
<i>What?</i>

666
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,115
-[Khloé] Yeah, it's so weird, trust me.
-[Kris laughs]

667
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,850
Oh, wait. This is Kylie calling.

668
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,051
-We'll call you right back.
-I'm like, "Babe..."

669
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,919
-<i>Okay, love you. Bye.</i>
-"...I think I'm gonna hate Kourtney..."

670
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,854
{\an8}[chimes]

671
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,723
{\an8}Well, you missed the barbecue,
and I really wanted to tell you something.

672
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,626
That's why I said it would be important
for... for you to be here.

673
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,062
-<i>Are you pregnant?</i>
-[Khloé] I'm pregnant.

674
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,130
[squeals]

675
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,631
-[Khloé] Yes.
-[laughter]

676
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,400
[Kylie] <i>Are you really?
'Cause I'm gonna cry.</i>

677
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,868
Don't cry, because it's...

678
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,703
-[Kris] Aw.
-<i>No, like, seriously.</i>

679
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,705
-<i>I'm so happy for you!</i>
-[laughter]

680
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,206
[Khloé] Oh, thank you.

681
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,809
<i>And Tristan. Love you.</i>

682
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,744
[Khloé] I'm pregnant.

683
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,080
-[laughs]
-That is so crazy.

684
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,215
It's different
that we're doing it together.

685
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,185
I wish that, like,
I was actually pregnant, but...

686
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,286
-[chuckles]
-You know.

687
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,357
I just never thought that this one
was gonna be able to have a baby.

688
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,428
I just want you to be happy.

689
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,264
[soft upbeat music]

690
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,475
{\an8}-[Kris] Hey.
-[Khloé] Hey, Mom.

691
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,810
[Kris] Are these Tristan's?

692
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,078
They're not mine.

693
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,713
[Khloé] Look how big the foot is.

694
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,214
What size shoe does he wear?

695
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,282
[Khloé] Fifteen.

696
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,683
Wow!

697
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,490
I really want to talk to you
about something that's serious.

698
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,027
When we were all at your house,
I felt like

699
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:52,497
Corey was doing anything
in his power to avoid me.

700
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,033
[Khloé] Some of my friends noticed.

701
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,368
They were like, "Is something going on
with you and Corey?

702
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,371
Like, why does every time you walk in
the room, he walks out of the room?"

703
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,539
Oh. Okay.

704
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,609
Like, I was announcing
I was having a baby, so I'm sorry.

705
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:08,880
The fact that he could barely say
congratulations to me blew my mind.

706
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,782
-Yeah.
-Don't be so [bleep] dramatic.

707
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,751
I want to know, like, what's going on,

708
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:16,588
and, like, why can't we both just coexist,
but more so for you.

709
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,723
Like, I don't want you
to feel ever uncomfortable,

710
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,924
especially in your own home

711
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,559
and in your own relationship,

712
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,595
-I think, as a mom.
-Yeah.

713
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:27,198
So I was thinking,
and if it's okay with you,

714
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,100
[Khloé] I just want to take him
to dinner or something.

715
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,668
A hundred percent.

716
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:31,936
I think that needs to happen.

717
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,541
If that energy is out there,
it's not okay with me.

718
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,980
My kids come first over anybody
ever for the rest of time.

719
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:46,484
So, I want one big, cuddly, happy family.

720
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,487
Anything else is never gonna work for me.

{\an8}[Khloé] Mom?

724
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,764
{\an8}-[Kris] Hey.
-[Khloé] Hey.

725
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,334
What are these? Veins?

726
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,436
-[Kris] Varicose veins.
-So what do I do with them?

727
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,406
You go to Dr. Shamban,
and that's her favorite thing.

728
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,075
She injects them with saline,
and they go away.

729
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:11,976
Ew.

730
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,378
It really hurts.

731
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,513
[scoffs]
So why would I wanna do it?

732
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,148
That's the only solution.

733
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,983
[Kris] No pun intended.

734
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,419
[Khloé] So, what's going on?

735
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,823
I'm just obsessing with my ears.

736
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,491
I just had my hair and makeup done,

737
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,761
and every time, I keep going,
"Is the swelling down yet?"

738
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,730
-What are all those dots in your ears?
-[Kris] Stitches.

739
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,265
Oh, you still have stitches in?

740
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,500
That's what I mean.

741
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,635
This healing process is wild.

742
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:38,803
So these are stitch...

743
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,705
-Yeah, you have stitches.
-Yeah. Right?

744
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,807
-What does the back look like?
-I don't want to look.

745
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,676
Look! I can't look.

746
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,077
[Khloé] Ew. It's, like, crusty.

747
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,614
Crusty?

748
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,316
-It's like...
-[Kris] That's a horrible word.

it looks like. Crust.

with this ear thing.

She's been obsessed.

I don't know whether to laugh
or be concerned.

00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,863
I'm just praying for a speedy recovery

755
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,166
'cause I need to stop hearing
about these damn earlobes.

756
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,970
[Kris] I've got all these fabulous
diamonds that I've been waiting to wear.

757
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,905
I mean, I have a collection now.

-But why are you rushing it?
-[Kris] They're really swollen.

They're like two little bulbs.

760

If you had short hair like me,
you would understand the journey.

761

[Kris] You would understand the battle.

When I was in college,
we would do this thing

766
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:45,270
where you look up the difference
between love versus infatuation.

767
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,971
-[Kourtney] It was this article.
-Oh, my God, you used to tell me this

-all the time.
-Yes.

769
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,910
"Infatuation makes you act crazy,
love calms you down."

770
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:56,114
-Nope. No.
-"Infatuation is intense but short-lived.

771
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,349
Love is comfortable, but lasts longer."

-[Kourtney] That just sounds boring.
-Boring.

I'm actually nervous to go to this lunch?

I just feel like, lately, things
have been weird between us,

00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,176
so I wanted to make sure.

792
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:01,512
Like, if there's anything,
we can talk about it.

793
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,581
Right.

794
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,819
I try. Like, when I see you,
I'm like, "Hey, Corey."

795
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,387
Like, I try to give you a hug,
but I'm always like,

796
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,521
I don't even know if you wanna hug me.

797
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,890
[Khloé] I don't even know what this is.

798
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,593

It's not like it's a problem.

I guess it just is what it is,
but it's not... me.

802
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,838
I don't dislike nobody.

803
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:27,739
I've... I've...

804
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,307
What you just said to me is what I feel.

805
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:34,412
Like, I wanted to figure out what was
the situation with how you are towards me.

-I always treat others as I'm treated.
-[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

807
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,451
And I get treated standoffish.

I like to give what I get as well,

809
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:43,988
but I think for my mom's sake,

810
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,424
I want to get to a place with you and I,

811
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,760
like, just where, like,
I want you to feel comfortable.

812
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:49,994
I want us to be like...

813
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,563
Like, we were cool for a minute,
then I don't know what happened.

814
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,465
I... I like all y'all,

815
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,200
but y'all are girls.

I'm a dude,

817
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,672
and I know how that [bleep] can go.

818
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,875
Why? What's the difference?

819
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,711
It... it just...

820
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,013
[Corey] We don't have a lot
of conversation. We don't talk.

821
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,448
I ain't talk to you in a long time,

822
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,785

to really come to you and ask you,

"Do you like me?"

824
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,088

that's asking for acceptance.

-No, no. You would want it...

827

You would want it genuinely.

828
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,495
[Corey] I'm not gonna come
campaign for it.

No, you don't want to force it.

I mean, Khloé, look.

As you get to know me better
or get to know my personality,

986
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,904
Watch the master, watch the master.

987
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,340
[Steve] Please welcome Khloé Kardashian
and Scott Disick.

988
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:44,375
[woman] Go!

989
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,777
[audience cheering]

990
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,818
Time at <i>The Steve Harvey Show</i> together
is giving me hope

991
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,120
because I feel like Corey and I, you know,

992
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,356
{\an8}it's this mutual relationship right here,
we're doing good.

993
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,624
{\an8}So this is the beginning,

994
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,360
hopefully, of a beautiful friendship.

995
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,563
[Khloé] Just saying bye.

996
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,864
Where's your stuff?

997
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,899
-They have it. Yeah.
-Are you sure?

998
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,468
-Oh, yeah.
-Thanks, Corey.

999
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,804
{\an8}[Kim] <i>On the next episode...</i>

1000
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:17,908
{\an8}One thing that most families
aren't prepared for is death.

1001
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,245
{\an8}Just imagine me
on that little black velvet pedestal.

1002
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,347
{\an8}[Kourtney] I have to do a home decor line.

1003
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,349
{\an8}This already sounds like too much
of a commitment for you.

1004
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,885
{\an8}You have a different work ethic
than the rest of us.

1005
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,720
{\an8}I'm not sitting here dilly-dallying.

1006
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,689
{\an8}[Kourtney]
Scott called me at two in the morning.

1007
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,224
{\an8}"He's your boyfriend?"

1008
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,226
{\an8}[Kris] He just seemed a little bit off.

1009
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,827
{\an8}[Khloé] Scott's having another episode.

1010
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,896
{\an8}[Kourtney] When is it gonna be enough?
