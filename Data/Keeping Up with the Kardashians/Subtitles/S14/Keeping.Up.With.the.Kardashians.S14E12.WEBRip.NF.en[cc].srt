{\an8}[Kim] What are you doing
the rest of the day?

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,610
{\an8}[Kris] I'm not going nowhere.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,280
I got, like, maybe 4,000 emails
to answer and...

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,049
-Same.
-[Kris] Why?

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,183
[Kim] Just asking.

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:21,521
Uh, we had something for you to sign,
but I think we just gave it to Alexa.

8
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,023
-[Kim] Mm.
-[Kris] Did we send that

9
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,791
signature page to Alexa?

13
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,465
What the [bleep]! Did you...

14
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,236
What... What is [bleep] wrong with you?

15
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,372
We just wanted to see
what you would look like with gray hair.

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,975
-How am I gonna get this off of me?
-[Khloé] Oh, my God.

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,710
Your hair looks so good.
[claps]

18
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,413
-Mom, you got to see your hair.
-[Kim] It does.

19
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,480
-[Khloé] Look.
-No.

20
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,949
[laughter]

21
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:53,353
Oh, well, good,
I'll just dip my head in a ball of flour

22
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,021
when I go out every night.

23
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,389
[laughter continues]

24
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,159
[Kris] How do I even get cleaned up?

{\an8}-[Jonathan] Hot damn. Oh, hot damn.
-Crazy.

28
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,691
{\an8}Oh, [bleep], what's up?

29
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,993
Oh, my God, you're on fire today.

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,428
-What?
-Holy [bleep]!

31
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,831
I haven't seen you
in an outfit like this in a long time.

32
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,998
-[Kim] What?
-Yeah.

33
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,767
-[Kim] Kanye picked it out.
-I love it.

34
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,104
He sent me, like, a whole email, like,
"You cannot wear big glasses anymore.

35
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,506
-It's all about tiny, little glasses."
-[Jonathan] That's it?

36
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,374
Where did he come up with that?

37
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,944
I don't know. He sent me,
like, millions of '90s photos

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,846
with tiny little glasses like this.

39
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,952
-[Kim] "You are an artistic person."
-[Jonathan] I want to get one.

40
00:01:59,018 --> 00:01:59,853
I'm not.

41
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,122
Actually, it lied.

42
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,757
Oh, my God.

43
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,527
-[Jonathan] Thank you.
-Thank you.

44
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,763
Very strong.

45
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,300
I was so annoyed. Kourtney canceled
her workout this morning.

46
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,435
[Jonathan] Did she really?

47
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,303
Yeah, because she said
she wasn't feeling well,

48
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,538
but she literally

49
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,274
will never take medicine,
never do anything.

50
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,942
-Never give the kids medicine.
-[Jonathan] She's so holistic.

51
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,879
-Oh, what's up? Hi.
-I'm freezing.

52
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,381
-I know, I'm freezing.
-[Jonathan] Do you want to get the check?

53
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,650
-Yeah, let's get the check.
-[Jonathan] We're, like, done.

54
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,652
-Where have you been?
-I can't eat anyways.

55
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,455
By the way, you know it's a rule.
You still have to come on time.

56
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,090
[Kim] Why can't you eat?

57
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,826
I'm not eating
because when you're getting sick,

58
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,461
it's best to not eat.

59
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,029
-Okay.
-And knock it out.

60
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,166
So I'm drinking
apple-lemon-ginger-cayenne juice.

61
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:51,004
[Kourtney] I had a bone broth,
and if I got hungry,

62
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,174
I would have, like,
apple cider vinegar and water.

63
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,410
Since I've been working out
with my bodybuilder Melissa,

64
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,313
I've really focused so much
on how I eat now,

65
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,215
and how to really eat clean and healthy,

66
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:06,186
and I've realized just how many fad diets
there are out there.

67
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:11,057
And I feel like Kourtney's always trying
something new and different,

68
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,860
and I just don't know
if it's the healthiest.

69
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,829
Luca's here. Are you friends with him?

70
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,798
-Mm-hmm.
-[Kourtney] He just got here.

71
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,836
I should've told him to come to lunch,
except that I was here for one minute.

72
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:24,804
Less.

73
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,776
[upbeat music]

74
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,020
{\an8}-Oh, I got to take this back.
-[Khloé] So take it back.

75
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,355
[Kim] Or were you gonna wear it?

76
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,256
[Khloé] No.

77
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,694
Oh, my God, I heard the craziest stuff
happened at that party the other night.

78
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:52,398
Did you know, like, when Evelyn was, like,
nuts, and, like, finger-banging herself?

79
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,866
Mm-hmm.

80
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:58,271
I saw videos of our friends,
there was a bunch of girls going out,

81
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,305
and they were wasted.

82
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,507
One of them just started
fingering herself.

83
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,243
[Khloé] And it's on video.

84
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,812
Apparently, girls get really crazy
when they have a girls night.

85
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,847
-She was not.
-[Khloé] Yeah, she was.

86
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,616
-I saw the videos.
-She was not. I was there.

87
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,516
She was not.

88
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,219
Weren't you asleep that night?
'Cause I heard that you were sleeping.

89
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,889
I saw the videos, it was Kourtney, her,
and whoever else is taking the videos.

90
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,459
You were not in them.
Were you asleep, yes or no?

91
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,961
-I was asleep at that moment.
-[Khloé] Okay, so you were asleep.

92
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,597
But I don't believe that she would be
sitting there doing that.

93
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:28,835
Why can't you just believe my...
I don't understand why you go from, like,

94
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,272
"That's not true. That didn't happen.
No, that's not true."

95
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:38,077
I don't know why Kim doesn't believe me.
She never believes me, to be honest.

96
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,813
[Khloé] But I would not
make up this story.

97
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,952
I don't care enough in my life
to just create random stories.

98
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,321
You were there, but you were sleeping,
so you didn't see it.

99
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,456
I'm telling the truth.
You're the [bleep] liar.

100
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,492
I'm telling you I saw it with my own eyes,

101
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:56,462
but you could go ahead and believe
whoever the [bleep] you want to believe,

102
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,830
and that's cool, we're good.

103
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,532
Totally.

104
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,601
Have a nice time.

105
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,471
You, it's been great, because she was
actually doing it standing over you,

106
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,775
so the fact that you're not chiming
in one time is wonderful.

107
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,877
-[Khloé] But that's okay.
-[Kourtney] It's true.

108
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,945
[tense music]

109
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,349
You could've just said before
I was telling the truth,

110
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,617
so it didn't escalate to that.

111
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,120
You piss me off,
'cause you never believe me.

112
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,222
[Kourtney] Thanks.

113
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,859
What if I just got up, and was like...

114
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,063
boom!
[laughs]

115
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,131
Did you see that I flinched one time?

116
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,602
You did. You're lying again!
You totally flinched.

117
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,504
[laughing]

118
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,774
[Kim] You're so easy to piss off.

119
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,678
You're so easy to make insecure.

120
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,781
Wait till I tell you about
your [bleep] fat ass in a second.

121
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:55,088
[Khloé] <i>My first time making madeleines.
I hope they taste good.</i>

122
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,124
[Kris] This was my mom's car
when I was a little girl.

123
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,659
Oh, my God.

124
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,795
Isn't this cute? Look at the red interior.

125
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,364
-This is so fun.
-So chic.

126
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,965
-[horn honks]
-[laughs]

127
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,867
[Jonathan] You used to cruise around
in this with your mom?

128
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,170
Yes, she used to take us to the beach
with the top down.

129
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,073
I can visualize, like, the good day.
Like, how fun it was.

130
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,341
It was so much fun.

131
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,176
It really was fun.

132
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,747
[Kris] So did I tell you
I bought my mom a condo?

133
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,982
-[Jonathan] That's incredible.
-It's a whole new chapter.

134
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,851
Aren't you so relieved that she's close?

135
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:25,818
Yeah.

136
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,354
-Will she hang out the house?
-Well, she's down there by herself.

137
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,655
She's 82 years old.

138
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,491
She has this stomach issue.

139
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,862
When she was going through
her chemo therapy for her colon cancer

140
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,498
and her radiation,
I think she got a lot of damage...

141
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,333
-Oh, of course.
-...to her organs.

142
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,301
[Kris] It's very, very painful.

143
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,805
That's why for my mom to move
from San Diego...

144
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,307
-[Jonathan] Right.
-...it's so, you know...

145
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,910
important.

146
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:56,149
You know, when I think about it now,
they say it's very life-changing

147
00:06:56,215 --> 00:07:01,554
for somebody older
to make a move like this at this age.

148
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,522
[Jonathan] Oh, boy.

149
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,058
Whoa!

150
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,361
-[Kris chuckles]
-Yikes.

151
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,496
-Okay.
-Ready?

152
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,598
[Jonathan] Yeah.

153
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,500
Oh, I have to take my seat belt off.

154
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,271
-[Kris] Hi.
-[Jonathan] Hi, how are you?

155
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,107
-Oh, the smell.
-Wow. I didn't know you had doughnuts.

156
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,776
What's the biggest, like,
hot fudge sundae thing you make?

157
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,279
-The Kitchen Sink.
-[Kris] We'll take a Kitchen Sink.

158
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,346
{\an8}[clerk] You got it.

159
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,782
I'm kind of in love with this place.
I'm not gonna lie.

160
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,686
So I'm a little worried
about her getting around.

161
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,189
-Like, my mom's gonna want to come here.
-Yeah, obviously.

162
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,492
Why don't you get her one of those,
like, "I've fallen and I can't get up"?

163
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,128
I did. She'll only wear that in the house.

164
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,230
-[Jonathan] Oh.
-Oh. Candy cigarettes.

165
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,765
-[Kris] Stop.
-[Jonathan] Oh, no, stop.

166
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,401
-This is so good.
-[Jonathan] What are these?

167
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,803
[Kris] Anyway, I got to figure it out.

168
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,905
If I know where she is,

169
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,974
-I'll feel so much more relax.
-You didn't know where she was

170
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,310
-for 27 years at the other place.
-I know, but now she's my responsibility.

171
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,878
She's on my watch now.

172
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,847
What do you think?

173
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,617
[Jonathan] They don't look weird on you.
Is that weird?

174
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,918
[laughter]

175
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,919
Awesome.

176
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,389
-I like this operation.
-[Kris] Yeah.

177
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,292
MJ really prides herself
on being independent,

178
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,161
and hates asking for help.

179
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,832
But, at the same time, I just... I feel like
I've got so much more responsibility

180
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,802
to make sure I know where she is
and that she's safe and okay.

181
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,339
So I really don't know
how else to do that,

182
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,942
unless I make sure I know exactly
where she is 24/7.

183
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,179
-Oh, my God, here it comes. Guys, hold on.
-No.

184
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,214
-[Jonathan] Oh, my God. Guys.
-[Kris] Oh.

185
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,483
-This is food god life.
-It's so cute.

186
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,053
{\an8}-Oh, my God. Kitchen Sink.
-It's everything, but the Kitchen Sink.

187
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,389
-[Kris] This is wild.
-[Jonathan] Oh, my God.

188
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,358
[clerk] Ready? One, two, three.

189
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,325
[camera shutter clicks]

190
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,494
-[Kris] So cute.
-I love ice cream.

191
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,563
[upbeat music]

192
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,270
{\an8}[phone ringing]

193
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,473
{\an8}Oh. My brother. It's Abraham.

194
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,908
{\an8}-<i>Hello?</i>
-Look who's here.

195
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,477
{\an8}-Sinbad.
-[Kourtney] Hey, Abe.

196
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,444
<i>Get back.</i>

197
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:10,383
I was with Dream yesterday,
and she was not happy.

198
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,552
-[Kourtney scoffs]
-<i>I know. She's teething.</i>

199
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,687
[Kourtney] Yeah, I felt so bad.

200
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,523
But everybody was,
"Little Rob, it's Rob in a dress."

201
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,460
Khadijah and Melissa Kolker,
they were, like, dying over her.

202
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,962
That's why I call her Roberta.

203
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,730
[Khloé] Where are you?

204
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,567
-<i>I'm at Pierce College going to my class.</i>
-[chuckles]

205
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,102
-Rob, okay.
-[Kim] Love you, Rob.

206
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,505
-<i>Love you, guys.</i>
-[Kim] Khloé, do you want a frozen banana?

207
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
[Khloé] No, I don't like those things.

208
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,909
-[Kourtney] What is that?
-[Kim] It's like a lemon dessert.

209
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,979
[Kourtney] Remember I told you, you're not
supposed to eat processed foods,

210
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,414
in general.

211
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,015
So is this cookie processed?

212
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,417
-Yes, right?
-[Kourtney] Yes.

213
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:47,887
Does Nillas come from a farm?
No. We shouldn't be eating it.

214
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:52,625
For example, there is great almond milks
that exist in life.

215
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,393
-Why?
-Chocolate almond milk.

216
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,662
Have your chef make almond milk
fresh once a week.

217
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,164
She made me make it.

218
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,434
[Kourtney] No, they put them
in the Vitamix, and they make vanilla.

219
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,503
It's fresh and it's all nat...
Like, organic almonds and stuff.

220
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,973
Sometimes preservatives
taste just that much better, though.

221
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,642
-[Kim] They really do.
-No, trust me. My almond milk is good.

222
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,578
-[Kourtney] Okay, let's get it together.
-[Khloé] Sara Lee bagels.

223
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,281
I see you, Kim.
You're right up my alley with this fridge.

224
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,551
-That's just so gross to give your kid.
-I want a bagel!

225
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,152
Everything you think you know,

226
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,189
I just read an article
that says that gluten-free diets

227
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,525
actually have more arsenic in them
and could be worse for you.

228
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,997
[Khloé] Arsenic is like a fire, right?
Hold on, a poison.

229
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,066
Arsenic in rice. Did you know that?

230
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,002
"The organs of the body
that are usually affected

231
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,471
by arsenic poisoning are the lungs, skin..."

232
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,073
-Maybe that's why your skin is so bad.
-[Kourtney] Hey, Khloé...

233
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,775
[Khloé] But your skin is horrible.

234
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,410
-That's probably why.
-You, guys, no.

235
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,344
[Khloé] What?

236
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:50,783
Obviously, I am the healthiest eater
in the Kardashian-Jenner clan.

237
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,919
Kim and Khloé like to give me
a hard time about it,

238
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:58,658
but they're so behind on,
like, information. I just find it funny.

239
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:03,029
The reason why people
can get arsenic poisoning

240
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,399
is because they substitute
gluten-free foods

241
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,334
with either corn or rice.

242
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,003
[Kourtney] So you're eating
more rice than normal.

243
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,108
Really, I love rice.
Like, love. Like, white on rice.

244
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,912
-White on rice?
-I love it like white on rice.

245
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,647
-Okay, Khlo.
-[Kim] Why is that a saying?

246
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,084
[Khloé] I don't know what that even means
because there's brown rice too.

247
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,521
-And yellow rice.
-[Khloé] So I love it like brown on rice.

248
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,822
Exactly, and black rice.

249
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,125
-And there's, like, red rice.
-[Khloé] Ooh, fancy.

250
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,560
[laughs]

251
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,962
[upbeat music]

252
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,305
{\an8}I got this new jean yesterday

253
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,309
that me and Kendall are the ones
who got the first samples, and they're...

254
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,846
[Kourtney] It's so funny. Our stylist
both pull all the same stuff for us.

255
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,047
Really?

256
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,184
-[Kourtney] I mean, some. Certain things.
-[scoffs]

257
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,153
[Khloé] I got a thank you letter
from Planned Parenthood today.

258
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,890
I thought... I had no idea that girl
was gonna say that she was HIV positive.

259
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,360
I wanted to ask, like, "So, where's
your boyfriend now? Like, were you angry?"

260
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,129
-[Khloé] But I was like...
-I know.

261
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,331
[Kim] I wanted to find out,
like, how did he get it?

262
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,200
Like, do you know
you got it from him, like...

263
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,736
Of course, she got it from him.
That's what she was saying.

264
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,437
-[Kim] Yeah.
-It was her first time having...

265
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,206
ever having unprotected sex.

266
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,342
-It's just so crazy.
-I love how you made up this whole story.

267
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,045
Yeah, she did not say that was
her first time having unprotected sex.

268
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,647
-But, Klo...
-Why do you... Why do you do that?

269
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,750
-But I like that Khloé says...
-No, but why do you do that to me

270
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:31,951
every time?

271
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,220
I think Khloé likes to exaggerate.

272
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:39,391
When we were younger, she would always
lie just to get attention,

273
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:44,263
so now I think it's just turned
into this, like, stream of lies.

274
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,999
Don't be a [bleep] bitch,
and make up that I'm a liar.

275
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,069
Kourtney was the one that brought it up,
not even me, and you're yelling at me.

276
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,271
I thought it was cute
how you piece it all together.

277
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,206
But that's what she said. She said,

278
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,675
-"I've never had unprotected sex."
-She did say that.

279
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,278
-[Khloé] It was her best friend...
-I didn't hear that, so my bad.

280
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,114
Obviously, you dipwad,
you don't pay attention to people.

281
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,884
You zone out and you perk up
when it's the right time.

282
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,253
I'm obviously invested
in paying attention.

283
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,420
I didn't hear.

284
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,389
But instead of saying,
"Why do you make up these stories?"

285
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,057
-Okay, you brought it up.
-All you've ever done

286
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,192
is do that type of [bleep].

287
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,994
You're just not a loyal person.

288
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,496
-And that's just my thing with you.
-Okay, this is getting way too deep.

289
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,665
-[Kim] I'm not a loyal person?
-Oh, I don't care. Not with me.

290
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,305
[upbeat music]

291
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,611
{\an8}[Jonathan] Should we start preheating?

292
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,481
The oven, for the cookies?
Ugh, I need one bite.

293
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,117
Just like that? You could eat it raw?

294
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,052
Yeah, 'cause there's no egg
because it's vegan.

295
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,488
Honestly, I haven't had them as a cookie

296
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,124
'cause cookie dough, to me,
is where it's at.

297
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,392
-Of course.
-[Kim] Okay.

298
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,794
So these are the vials that they sent.

299
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,230
We have to collect sweat.

300
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,532
Go in the sauna.

301
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,335
Definitely, if we're even in the robes,
we'll sweat even more.

302
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,205
Are you sure we're gonna get enough sweat?
I feel like, we have to, like...

303
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,740
You'd have to squeeze me out
to get to fill this in.

304
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,742
Gluten with a sweat test?

305
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,645
-[Kim] Yeah.
-I've never heard of it.

306
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,883
It's to get all your, like, levels,
and it tests, like, your arsenic.

307
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,887
I've never heard of a sweat test,
and it just sounds gross,

308
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:18,657
but we do some pretty crazy things
to get the information we need,

309
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,427
especially when it comes
to, like, beauty and health.

310
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:27,566
So I am definitely willing to do
Kim's test to prove that I'm healthier.

311
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,701
[whooshes]

312
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,070
Oh, [bleep]. This is fun.

313
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,706
-[Kim] I've never been in here.
-This is so weird.

314
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,310
[exhales]
You're collecting sweat already?

315
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,246
I'm sweating already, which is great.

316
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,549
[quirky music]

317
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,785
I feel like my legs are sweating.

318
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,827
I feel like a freaking pig.

319
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,963
-Yeah.
-Your face is bright red.

320
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,299
[Jonathan] I'm [bleep] going down.

321
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,568
[quirky music]

322
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,338
I think this is good enough.

323
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,675
-Oh, it looks like cloudy sweat.
-Ew!

324
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,244
-I can't even look.
-[Kim] That is disgusting.

325
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,314
-[Kourtney] I'm ready to get out of here.
-[Jonathan] You ready?

326
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,483
-Yeah.
-I'm done, too. Come on. Let's go.

327
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,486
This is insane.
I've got about three drops.

328
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,324
[Jonathan] I think this test is a goof.

329
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,794
-[Kourtney] Enjoy.
-[Jonathan] Here, Kim. Take our sweat.

330
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,963
At least we're not drinking it, guys.

331
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,332
I think your [bleep] poisoned with makeup.

332
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,135
If we're gonna do this,
let's just all get the real test.

333
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,804
-[Kim] What is the real test?
-[Jonathan] Wasn't this the real test?

334
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,740
I'll ask my doctor,
but I don't want to take false results

335
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,511
from, like, sweat mixed
with, like, makeup and spray tan.

336
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,347
Oh, I get it. That was, like, exhausting.

337
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,351
[Kim] I think I definitely need
to start drinking more water.

338
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,356
[upbeat music]

339
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,630
{\an8}-[MJ] Have you seen <i>Wonder Woman?</i>
-I am Wonder Woman.

340
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,098
You were when you were little too.

341
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,233
That's what you dressed up for
at Halloween.

342
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,969
-Mm-hmm.
-It was just this real handmade

343
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:10,970
Wonder Woman.

344
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,738
-I got you.
-It was a white T-shirt,

345
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,807
and we drew things on it and...

346
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,076
-Some shoes.
-[MJ] What? Oh.

347
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,044
Adidas. Love it.

348
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,180
-Thank you.
-How cute are these?

349
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,515
Aw, I love the white. Love it.

350
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,984
-Isn't that great?
-It'll go with me.

351
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,419
-[MJ] Yeah.
-And then I got you

352
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,122
-this little prezzie.
-[MJ] Oh, my goodness.

353
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,292
The greatest little insole...

354
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,694
-that...
-[MJ] For the shoe?

355
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,363
-For the shoe.
-[MJ] Oh, cool.

356
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:42,001
I don't want MJ to feel
like I am breathing down her neck,

357
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,503
but I really want to know
where she is all the time

358
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,471
so I know she's okay.

359
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:49,174
[Kris] It's got a little
electronics attached.

360
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,943
[gasps]
So cool.

361
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,078
[MJ] Does it tell you how many steps?

362
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,446
[Kris] I think so.

363
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:59,151
So I bought her a pair of shoes
to go with these amazing tracking devices.

364
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:04,490
They will let me know
exactly where Mary Jo is 24/7.

365
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,792
I love technology.

366
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,827
[Kris] Any time you're wearing a shoe,

367
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:09,862
-put this in.
-Put em...

368
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,730
-[MJ] Yeah.
-It'll just be more comfortable for you.

369
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,234
-Yeah. Put a little bounce in my step.
-[Kris] A little bounce in your flounce.

370
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,436
-[MJ] That is fabulous.
-Let me know how comfortable these are.

371
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,971
I will. Thank you so much.

372
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:20,806
You're a good daughter.

373
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,841
-[Kris] Just trying.
-I love these.

374
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,647
It doesn't say that it tells you
your steps. Let me see.

375
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,683
-[Kris] Oh, we'll figure it out.
-[MJ] Yeah.

376
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,018
Okay. All right.

377
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,820
I'm gonna put these things away now.

378
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,288
-Okay.
-All right, I love you, Mom.

379
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,357
-I love you. Thank you for my shoes.
-Eat your lunch.

380
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,659
-We don't want you to blow away.
-[MJ chuckles]

381
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,927
[Kris] Eat your lunch.

382
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,495
-I will.
-[Kris] Okay.

383
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,465
[upbeat music]

384
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,145
I didn't get the memo
that we were dressing up for lunch.

385
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,047
I just never go outside. I had to.

386
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,849
I know. It's a good idea.
I love that you did this for me.

387
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,617
-I feel really special.
-You look nice.

388
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,153
-She dressed up for me.
-You're so yummy.

389
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,423
I had hot dates.
I had to impress these two.

390
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,092
-You do.
-Totally impressed.

391
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,261
[Khloé] I'm having a glass of wine,
for sure.

392
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,763
I've been getting into, like,

393
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,566
an obscene amount of fights with Kimberly.

394
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:21,500
For what?

395
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,802
[Khloé] So, we were talking,
and I was telling her a story.

396
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,537
Kim said, "Why would you say that?"

397
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,741
Not once, like, "Are you sure?"
Or "That just sounds so extreme."

398
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,344
When you accuse me of lying
when I'm not lying, I...

399
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,847
-You get defensive. Yeah.
-[Khloé] Beyond.

400
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:38,016
[Khloé] Kim and I have a long history
of her doubting me.

401
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,819
But I don't think I'm a liar.
I normally don't lie.

402
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,922
Literally, I used to lie
when I was 16 years old. Who doesn't?

403
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,692
Like, didn't say where I was really going,
I would sneak out.

404
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,428
I was a bad teenager. Most kids are.

405
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:54,333
But ever since then, I have been labeled
a liar, and it's just frustrating

406
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:59,638
because I'm not sure why I'm being held
to something I did when I was 16.

407
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,740
And then I was like,
"You know what? [bleep] you.

408
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,008
You always take other people's sides."

409
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,943
But why did you say, "[bleep] you"?

410
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,447
[Khloé] 'Cause she was like,
"You always make up stories."

411
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,682
Your response, Khlo,

412
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,985
is not making this any better.

413
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,120
[Malika] Stop reacting to her.

414
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,590
She's poking the damn bear,
and you're just letting her get you.

415
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,958
[Malika] You're better than that.

416
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,229
You're the last person
that most people want to tee off on

417
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,398
because your word vomit is crazy.

418
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,136
[Khloé] I don't get why I'm so passive
with Kourtney.

419
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,604
I like, laugh, at Kourtney.

420
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,675
With Kim, I will bite down her throat,
and with Kris, I do the same thing.

421
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,776
I don't know why.

422
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,679
So that's you admitting
that you have to change something.

423
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,114
You can't change anybody else.

424
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,083
[Khadijah]
But you can change your reaction.

425
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,152
-I know.
-[Malika] I really think you are.

426
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,556
-You have to work on your patience.
-[Khloé] I do agree it's not right.

427
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,791
-It's like something possesses me.
-[Khadijah] It's a challenge.

428
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,693
[laughs]
I know.

429
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,562
I might need an exorcism.

430
00:19:56,628 --> 00:20:00,499
I always want more patience.
I have so much patience for children.

431
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,101
Then when it comes to my sisters
who are, like, adults,

432
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,304
I have such a short fuse.

433
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,706
So I wish I thought of adults as children.

434
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,643
-Honestly, I love Kim, we just have a...
-It doesn't mean you don't love her.

435
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,445
[Khadijah] It doesn't mean you don't...
[laughs]

436
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,014
We just have
a very dysfunctional relationship.

437
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,317
[laughter]

438
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,019
Love's got nothing to do with it, honey

439
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,255
-Cheers.
-[Khloé] Yeah. Cheers.

440
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,923
{\an8}-Sorry.
-Cheers.

441
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:29,995
[Kim] Hey.

442
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,663
-Hi. Hi, guys.
-[Kourtney] Hey, guys.

443
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,065
[Jonathan] Is this where you come
all the time?

444
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,033
[Kourtney] I have to come back again
later today.

445
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,035
-This is your spot?
-This is my spot.

446
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,273
Since Kim's sweat test
was an epic failure,

447
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,344
we decided that a blood and urine test
would be most accurate,

448
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,249
so we are going to a doctor
that I see for food allergies,

449
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:54,486
and I ask him any health questions
that I have. I always ask him.

450
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,155
-Is it a full blood test here?
-[Kourtney] I don't know.

451
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,224
[Jonathan] I need to know
what kind of doctor this is

452
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,392
before I'm doing any blood.

453
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,494
-Like, what is this?
-This is gluten-free.

454
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,396
This is the gluten-free center.

455
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,497
-[doctor] Hello, guys.
-Hi.

456
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,399
{\an8}-Hi. How are you?
-I don't think we've met.

457
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,568
{\an8}-I'm Jonathan. How are you?
-Jonathan.

458
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,203
-Kim, good to see you again.
-How are you? Good to see you.

459
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,704
-[Kourtney] Hi.
-I see you all the time.

460
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,774
So Kim has been wanting to do
a health test,

461
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:20,145
and we tried, like, a sweat thing
that didn't really work.

462
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:24,216
[Kim] I just want, like, because Kourtney
is gluten-free and I'm not,

463
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,218
I want to see who's healthier.

464
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,354
-You want to see who's healthier?
-Kim never believes me

465
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,856
that I should be gluten-free.

466
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,958
We want to know,
is this a shrink's office?

467
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,793
'Cause we think Kourtney's insane.

468
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,495
I wanna know what kind
of doctor's office are we in?

469
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,030
[Kim] Yeah, just gluten-free crackers.

470
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,631
[Jonathan] Gluten-free cheese.

471
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,932
-Dairy-free cheese.
-Dairy-free cheese.

472
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,202
All Kourtney is really doing,
which to some people seems extreme,

473
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:48,707
but she's doing what she needs to do
to get herself feeling as good as she can,

474
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,909
-and being as healthy as she can.
-And I feel great.

475
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,277
-[Dr. Byrnes] Yeah.
-Good for you.

476
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,079
-What she's done is she's broken a cycle.
-[Kourtney] Totally.

477
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,881
-Pretty significantly.
-Yeah.

478
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,385
Okay, so, we're gonna measure
three toxic metals,

479
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,988
and this is a good baseline for you.

480
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,523
[Jonathan]
Is it, like, a needle blood test?

481
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,224
-Yep, yep.
-Meaning that's, like,

482
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,327
blood off the veins, or, like, a finger?

483

No, I just had one yesterday
for something.

-[Kourtney] Let's do it.

-Let's do the blood. Who's first?
-[Kim] I'll go first.

No, let me just get it over with, please.
'Cause otherwise, I won't do it, trust me.

I'll go last.

with blood. Yeah, I have to lay down.

-[Kim] Oh, Jonathan.
-No, I do. I faint sometimes.

-Just by accident.
-[Kim] Oh, come on.

-You get a lollipop?

00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,459
-And she needs to wear them all the time.
-Are they good arch support?

646
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,661
Absolutely not.

647
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,729
It's got a chip in it.

648
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,935
Look, it shows her going from my house.
Follow the shoe, follow the sole.

649
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,739
-[Kris] They're gonna track...
-You're psychotic.

650
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,709
I'm really smart, actually.

651
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,177
[tense music]

652
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,079
[clicks tongue]

653
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,886
It is wild that my mom
has put trackers in MJ's shoe soles.

654
00:30:54,953 --> 00:31:00,124
Like, that's just invasive, and I think
that my mom should just let her be.

655
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,194
Like, she's good.
She's smarter than all of us.

656
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,597
She's getting a little too independent
over there,

657
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,465
and I want to make sure she's safe.

658
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:13,671
It's my 82... almost 83-year-old mother,
who I want to know where she is.

659
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,541
[Kourtney] Mom, you cannot, like,
worry about her like this.

660
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:20,812
She's the one who taught us all
how to be independent women.

661
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,550
She can still be an independent woman.
I can just make sure she's okay.

662
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,151
Let her live.

663
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:31,422
Mom, you cannot do this all day.
She's fine.

664
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,197
[upbeat music]

665
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,369
{\an8}-[MJ] Hello?
-[Kris] Hey, Mom.

666
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,704
-Did you sleep last night?
-I did.

667
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,773
-In your new bed? Yeah?
-I did. Yes.

668
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,508
-How are you?
-[Kris] Give me a hug.

669
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,409
[loud smooch]

670
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:55,113
-You match your house. This is amazing.
-Well, yeah. I hated to leave.

671
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,349
Kourtney threatened me

672
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,753
that unless I tell MJ
that I'm tracking her,

673
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:02,754
that she's going to.

674
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,790
And I definitely want to tell MJ first

675
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:11,296
because Kourtney's delivery
is always a bit suspect.

676
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,698
[Kris] So...

677
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,534
Well, I have to... I have a confession.

678
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,570
-What?
-I put a tracker in your shoe.

679
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,606
[tense music]

680
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,609
-Why?
-So I can keep track of you.

681
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,047
-[chuckles]
-It's like my little mommy babysitter.

682
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:34,018
-You don't trust me?
-I trust you. I just worry about you.

683
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,521
And I want to make sure
I know where you are all the time.

684
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,692
-That's kinda weird.
-[Kris] Which is probably pretty silly.

685
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,894
-It is a little creepy, right?
-It's a little weird.

686
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,332
I am the last person
who wants to take away your freedom.

687
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,268
And I really want you to know
that I have a lot of respect for you

688
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,303
and for everything
that you've always done for me.

689
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,639
And I just want you to be happy and safe.

690
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:58,176
Well, you should feel a little creepy
about putting things in my shoe.

691
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,911
-[MJ] My God!
-[laughs]

692
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,580
I'm gonna go in the kitchen
and take these off.

693
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,949
-[MJ] No wonder I was limping around.
-[laughs]

694
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,117
[MJ chuckles]

695
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,120
[upbeat music]

696
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,427
{\an8}[Jonathan] Do you know how to turn on
the air conditioning?

697
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,196
{\an8}Kourtney literally
does not have one in here.

698
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,465
-[Jonathan] No, no, no.
-It's why I always sweat to death.

699
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,834
Please put on the air conditioning.
I'm begging you.

700
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,068
I don't even know.

701
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,037
-[Jonathan] You know.
-Look at this place.

702
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,639
-[Jonathan laughs]
-It's so interesting.

703
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:32,043
It is. It is,
but where's the air conditioning?

704
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,445
-It's not in this place.
-[Jonathan] At all?

705
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,182
-It's so interesting.
-[Jonathan] It's like a hut in here.

706
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,786
-Hi. It's so hot in here.
-It's a [bleep] oven. Help me.

707
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:46,524
I should bring some ice in here
and cover this place with ice.

708
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,659
[Jonathan chuckles]
That's a good idea.

709
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:52,530
So this scientist, Dr. Rhonda,
is gonna come and meet us,

710
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:56,234
and tell us all about, like, gluten-free
and how it affects our bodies and...

711
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,869
Do you want to hear about that?

712
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,104
[Kim] After all the back and forth
with Kourtney,

713
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,709
we decided to do the smart thing
and reach out to an expert on nutrition.

714
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:09,313
There's just so much conflicting info
out there that it's really hard to know

715
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,216
who to trust and what you should really
be eating.

716
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,518
-Hi.
-[Kourtney] Hi. How are you?

717
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,753
-I'm doing pretty good. How are you?
-Good. I'm Kourtney.

718
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,854
Nice to meet you.

719
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,489
[Kim] So I hope that she just,

720
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,292
you know, can help give us
all the information we need.

721
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,694
So I was reading
about an article that said

722
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:27,365
that gluten-free
can actually be more harmful for you.

723
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,401
And I feel like there's always fads,
there's always stuff going on.

724
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,237
-Uh, well, so...
-[Kourtney] Well, it can be right, right?

725
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,740
-Yeah, I mean, there's...
-Let's listen to the professional.

726
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,109
-No, because...
-I actually know the study

727
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,077
you were referring to.

728
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,646
And they found that people
that ate gluten-free diets

729
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,682
had, like, twice as much arsenic

730
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,951
and, like, 70 percent
more mercury in their blood.

731
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:52,957
But I was telling Kim,
just being gluten-free is not unhealthy.

732
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:57,428
It's like if you're gluten-free
and just eating a lot of processed foods,

733
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,665
which, gluten-free or not,
that's just not good, anyways.

734
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,202
Exactly. Gluten-free diets have become
such a fad that people are just buying

735
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,604
-all this, like, package, yeah.
-[Kourtney] Gluten-free.

736
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:11,275
And a lot of times what people do
is they'll substitute rice flour,

737
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,112
and rice bioaccumulates mercury
and arsenic.

738
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,081
In my mind, when I read this study,
what I started to think about was,

739
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,718
"What about all the people eating rice?
Like, in China or, you know, Japan."

740
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,122
-Yeah, for breakfast.
-Yeah, so this is kind of a field of study

741
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,791
I'm, like, obsessed with.
It's called nutrigenomics,

742
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,894
where, basically, like,
thousands of years ago,

743
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,929
people have come
from different parts of the world,

744
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,664
and you weren't really traveling
much then,

745
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,501
so, you kind of, like,
were beholden to the food

746
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,269
that you could grow in that region, right?

747
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,538
And the theory is,
that people have similar genes,

748
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,507
but we have different variations
in these genes.

749
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:46,210
So some people can process carbs better.
Some people can process fat better.

750
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,814
Some people can process lactose better
or gluten, like, things like that.

751
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,817
So, basically,
eat everything in moderation

752
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,153
-because we're [bleep] at some point.
-[Jonathan] You can't win either way.

753
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,855
But you sweat...
you could sweat this stuff out too.

754
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,857
You sweat mercury, arsenic,

755
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,859
-all these heavy metals out of...
-[Kim] Really?

756
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,294
-Yeah.
-[Kourtney] Like, with steam?

757
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:07,231
-Yeah, steam rooms, saunas, exercise.
-Sitting in this room.

758
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,333
Right. I think I just lost like 13...

759
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,269
-13 ounces of cadmium.
-I just turned the air on.

760
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,471
-I'm so sorry it's so hot in here.
-[chuckles]

761
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:17,808
But there is no benefit
to eating gluten for anybody, right?

762
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,911
The only benefit is that

763
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:24,916
most of the foods that gluten is found in
have a lot of fiber.

764
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,384
-[Kourtney] Okay.
-And so...

765
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,253
-the fiber is so damn important...
-Okay.

766
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,122
...but there are things you can do
to counter it.

767
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,825
Other food sources of fiber
include vegetables, fruits, seeds, nuts.

768
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,495
I'm gonna look into my fiber
and how much I'm getting.

769
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,697
[Rhonda]
Yeah, it really makes a difference.

770
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:43,734
From this experience, I've definitely
learned that it's just not that simple.

771
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,771
There isn't a perfect science,
and my lifestyle is working for me.

772
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,639
And Kourtney's lifestyle
is working for her.

773
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,208
[Kourtney] Are you gluten-free?

774
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,710
I try to eat a diet
that's mostly, like, whole foods.

775
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:56,214
Like, I try to avoid the processed foods
and the packaged foods and all that,

776
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,350
and so it sort of ends up
being mostly gluten-free.

777
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:03,754
So I'll eat, like, chicken.
I eat steak. I eat, um, salmon.

778
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,957
But I also, like, eat like a vegetarian

779
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,793
'cause I eat so many vegetables
and, like, a wide variety.

780
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,095
Oh, I wish I could do that.
I just, like, can't eat...

781
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,732
[Kourtney] All I'm eating right now
is vegetables, fruit and protein.

782
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:15,833
Aren't you starving?

783
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,001
-No.
-It's so hard for me.

784
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,271
-[Rhonda] Once you start doing it, though...
-Yeah, once you get used to it,

785
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:24,642
like, it takes... I would say it takes
two weeks to really get used to it.

786
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,143
[Jonathan] Cool. I'm starving.

787
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,445
-You are?
-Yeah.

788
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,281
[Kourtney] Um, do we have
any other questions?

789
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,750
No, just how fast can you get a pizza
over here?

790
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,018
[chuckles]

791
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,254
-Thank you so much for coming out.
-Thank you.

792
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,624
I'm having a ball. Thank you.

793
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,926
-[Khloé] What are we doing?
-We're winning.

794
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,594
Heaven.

795
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,966
{\an8}-[Khloé] Hello?
-What are you doing here?

796
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,703
Well, I had to ambush you.

797
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,772
{\an8}[tense music]

798
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,841
{\an8}[Khloé] Why have you been avoiding me?

799
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,914
I mean, I've just been laying low.
You called me a disloyal person.

800
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,784
I'm just, like, over it because I'm not.

801
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:11,989
I feel super bad about it,
and I don't want to react that way to you.

802
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:16,427
But then I'm embarrassed, and, like,
it's disturbing how I respond to you.

803
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,930
And I just feel like it stems from years
and years of you not believing me.

804
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,701
And I get when I was 16, I used to,
like, exaggerate and tell stories,

805
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,836
but that was, like, when I was 16.

806
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:30,107
I have, like, I have come so far with you.
Like, I've been pretty, like...

807
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,609
When it comes to straight-up facts,

808
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,111
I've been pretty, like, loyal
and honest, whatever.

809
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,748
So I don't know, but it doesn't matter
if you believe me or not.

810
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,919
I need to know, like, it's my truth
and I'm... I am saying the truth,

811
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,455
so why do I get so annoyed with you?
And I don't know.

812
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,924
I don't know.
I don't even know why I don't...

813
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,660
believe you half the time.

814
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,861
Like, uh, you've never...

815
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,565
you haven't given me a reason
in so long to not believe you.

816
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,301
So I don't know why that's, like,
my thing with you.

817
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,105
But I... Honestly, just by you
saying that, that means so much

818
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,108
and, like, I appreciate that, like,
even just that you're acknowledging that.

819
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,843
That really means a lot.

820
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,913
And I'm just really sorry
for my short temper with you

821
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:09,947
and I'm working on it.

822
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,116
I'm trying to better myself and just...

823
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,685
You know, I shouldn't react that way.
So I love you and I'm sorry.

824
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,955
I love you too,
and I'm sorry if I doubted you.

825
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,724
I do get why Khloé gets so upset.

826
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,692
'Cause if someone didn't believe you
all the time,

827
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,127
that would be so frustrating.

828
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,564
I can be pretty critical,
especially with my sisters,

829
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,567
so I definitely want
to, like, try to reprogram,

830
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:35,873
try to figure out how to be more open
and accepting and just believing in her.

831
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:40,511
{\an8}I say we both try
to make a conscious effort

832
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,446
{\an8}to like, I won't go off on you like that,

833
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,715
{\an8}and you just try to give me
the benefit of the doubt.

834
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,752
-[Kim] Okay. Deal.
-Sounds like a plan.

835
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,187
{\an8}[Kim] <i>On the next episode...</i>

836
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,889
{\an8}-You're going on a trip?
-To Egypt.

837
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,357
{\an8}-With your kids?
-[Kourtney] No.

838
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:59,029
{\an8}It is hard to balance being
in a relationship, work and my children.

839
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,299
{\an8}This is your friend Pierre.
You guys are so cute.

840
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,934
{\an8}-[Kris] I really have to pee.
-[laughing]

841
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,570
{\an8}You are gonna be in so much trouble.
Get down.

842
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:09,240
{\an8}There's no way Rob and Chyna
are gonna get back together.

843
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,276
{\an8}The legal battle that has been going on
between the two of them is escalating.

844
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,678
{\an8}What's going on? Oh, [bleep].
