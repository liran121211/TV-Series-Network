1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,042
Some of Kylie's packages
were just delivered.

2
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,077
Packages or boxes?

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,146
-Lots of boxes.
-Do I need my drink?

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,582
-You definitely need your drink.
-[bleep].

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:20,387
What? Where does she think
we're gonna put this stuff?

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:27,093
Kylie decided to remodel her house,
so guess whose house she moved into?

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,061
Mine.

8
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,398
Does she think I'm [bleep] unpacking
these boxes?

9
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:35,435
This is supposed to be
such a little temporary thing

10
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:40,073
that the number of boxes is mind-blowing.

11
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:41,908
[imitates explosion]

12
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,676
[Matthew]
This is just part of her wardrobe.

13
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,279
The rest is at the other house
for her to go through.

14
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,615
Part of her wardrobe?

15
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:49,916
But none of her, like...

16
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:51,718
belongings and things.

17
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,153
She's trying to kill me.

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,256
[Kris] And how long
am I gonna live like this?

19
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,658
Kim said she was moving in
for a couple weeks.

20
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,429
She stayed for three years. Three years!

21
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,066
[theme music]

22
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,788
{\an8}[Khloé] Did you work out today?

23
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,023
{\an8}-Yeah.
-With Don?

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,658
{\an8}-[Khloé] No. Joe?
-With Joe.

25
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:35,261
{\an8}-How was it?
-He gets deep into my abs,

26
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,965
{\an8}and he also gets deep into my butt now
since I said that.

27
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,734
All you do is talk about
how deep he goes in your abs.

28
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,939
I was thinking, because how many people
ask us about our workouts...

29
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,807
-Mm-hmm.
-...and, like, what we do,

30
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,876
people will literally,
if we don't post our workouts,

31
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,079
they're like, "Help, I don't know
what to do today in the gym."

32
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,647
What we do now on our apps,
we just kind of do,

33
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:55,949
like, a montage of our workouts.

34
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:01,554
We need to be like, "Okay, guys,
so this step isolates

35
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,225
your gluteus maximus, and this muscle..."
Da, da, da...

36
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,662
But I think, also, showing people
how you just do a workout,

37
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,500
like, at home, like, no excuses,
like, no gym equipment.

38
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,002
Kourtney and I have so much fun
working out together,

39
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,439
and we've been discussing
doing a fitness video forever.

40
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:24,177
I wanted to talk about me and Khloé
doing a fitness video,

41
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,012
because we work out every day.

42
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,681
I would say it's, like,
one of our passions.

43
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,618
[Khloé] I just think we got
to teach people to stop complain...

44
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,886
Don't make excuses.

45
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,488
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-Don't cheat yourself, treat yourself.

46
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,991
[Khloé] We all know that Kourt
has the hardest time

47
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,225
following through with things.

48
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,561
I am genuinely hoping for the best,

49
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:45,098
because I want to be a part of the new
Jane Fonda and Suzanne Somers.

50
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,104
[Khloé] If you go over there,
don't you dare go up my...

51
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,806
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[Kourtney] Oh, wait, this is good.

52
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,143
[Khloé] Oh, my God, it's huge!

53
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,378
[Kourtney] Should I post this?

54
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,980
[Khloé] That's what it looks like
from that side?

55
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,149
Oh, my God.

56
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,853
{\an8}[Kim] This is just a little part
of my sprints, you guys.

57
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,788
I don't even think you understand.

58
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,591
{\an8}Khloé, where'd you get those glass jars?

59
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,127
-Uh...
-Don't tell her.

60
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,628
She'll have them in two seconds.

61
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,665
Everything in her house
is literally from my house.

62
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,833
Who cares if I have a glass jar
like yours?

63
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,235
[Khloé] Oh, my God.

64
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,104
You guys, so I went to this, um...
[clicks tongue]

65
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,306
...media training.

66
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,375
I didn't think I needed it
after, like, ten years of doing media,

67
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,278
but, like, it was so helpful
and so beneficial,

68
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:37,150
and I think you'll just learn things about
yourself that you just could improve.

69
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:41,721
There's always some talk show
or something that's going on in our lives

70
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,123
or one of our family members' lives

71
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,292
that we don't really want
to be asked sometimes,

72
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,029
and we do all get nervous
at different points.

73
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,099
-I'm gonna have a heart attack.
-No, you are gonna do great.

74
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,067
Why are you so nervous?

75
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,069
-You've done a million talk shows.
-[Kourtney] I know.

76
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,870
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

77
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,673
{\an8}Um, can I ask you about Scott?
How is he? What's going on?

78
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,575
{\an8}Are y'all together? Are you not together?

79
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,310
{\an8}[crowd laughs]

80
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,511
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

81
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,381
I just think it'll be a really good idea
to get prepared

82
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,751
and have everyone face our fears
and figure out what that is,

83
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,287
what our strong points are,
our weaknesses are.

84
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,789
I don't think
you could ever be too prepared.

85
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,526
I don't really want to do it,
only because I don't want it to filter me.

86
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,663
I like just being me, and I think
that's what people like from me.

87
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,764
And I like that I don't really...

88
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,866
Like, I just, like, do an interview.
I don't really think.

89
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,502
Yeah, like, does it add more pressure,
because then you're thinking?

90
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,537
Like, I'm thinking, "Am I doing it right?"

91
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,972
"What am I saying?
Did I say the word 'like'?"

92
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,874
To hold my head right?
Do I have to not be Khloé?

93
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,010
I mean, this isn't to, like,
put words in your mouth,

94
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:42,215
this is just to, like, give you the tools
to, like, know how to be prepared

95
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,983
when someone says something.

96
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,853
I don't want to do it.
I don't want to do media.

97
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:51,591
I don't want to be on the defensive
about us or about Caitlyn

98
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,995
or about my kids or, you know,
any other thing we do.

99
00:04:56,062 --> 00:05:02,235
I think I am enjoying private life
to be private when we're off-camera

100
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,836
and we're not shooting our show.

101
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,973
But, Mom, you saying
you never gonna do media again

102
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,975
is not a way to address the issue.

103
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,377
[Khloé] That's how you're only
gonna make things worse,

104
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,980
because then you're gonna get more nervous
when you actually have to do something.

105
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,282
-Yeah.
-[Kourtney] All right, let's go, Poosh.

106
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,785
-[giggles]
-[Kourtney] Whoa!

107
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,353
[Khloé] You're on the top of our fort?

108
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,988
The fort is falling! Aah!

109
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,289
-[giggles]
-[chuckles]

110
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,959
[upbeat music]

111
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,095
Hey, darling, you know it's real
when you Snapchat

112
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,196
we're together, you know?

113
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,265
Oh, you know it's real
when we're together.

114
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,134
-[Kourtney] You can't do a cartwheel?
-[Khloé] No.

115
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,903
-Literally can't.
-Can you do a roundoff?

116
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,071
What the [bleep] is that?

117
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,274
A roundoff, just when you do...

118
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,609
[Khloé gasps]

119
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,282
[laughs]

120
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,483
Did I do it?

121
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,618
[Khloé] Hand, hand.

122
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,686
[laughs]

123
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,822
[laughter]

124
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,256
[Khloé] What do you mean?

125
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,294
So Kourt and I really want to get started
on our fitness video,

126
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,964
and I've booked a studio
so we can start some choreography

127
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,834
and figuring out, really, where we're
gonna head with this whole thing.

128
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,505
Okay. But what do you envision,
so for the actual video?

129
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,641
-I think we should be like...
-No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on.

130
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,978
We need our warm-up, which is a stretch.
Do you stretch before you work out?

131
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:19,912
[Kourtney] Yeah.

132
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,280
-You know how I stretch?
-[groans]

133
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:22,949
I stretch like this.

134
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,618
[Khloé laughs]

135
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,389
Kourtney. We can't...
That's what we're gonna show?

136
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,093
We could do, like, little...
This kind of feels good.

137
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,531
And you could make, like, sexual noises,
because I think people like that.

138
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,167
[both moaning]

139
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,136
Remember to breathe, guys.

140
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,571
I think Kourt and I both have no idea

141
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,341
what it entails
to do a whole fitness video.

142
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,210
We could say, "Let's... You just do
your own little stretch.

143
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:55,448
Whatever body parts you feel need
to be stretched, guys,

144
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,817
-you take care of it."
-No.

145
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,053
That's hopscotch.

146
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,756
I think our Snapchats
are right up our alley,

147
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,124
because we don't have to do much.

148
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,660
This is a huge production.
This isn't, like...

149
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,429
[Kourtney] Okay, well, this is day one.

150
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,330
[Khloé] And who's paying for this all?

151
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,832
-Who's...
-[Kourtney] Me and you.

152
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,735
So we're gonna pay for lighting,
hair and makeup,

153
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,804
wardrobe, a choreographer,

154
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,508
a video director, an editor, music.
What do we want to do?

155
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,210
Obviously, we work out every day,

156
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,412
and we have our trainers
that tell us what to do,

157
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,416
so maybe this isn't, like, our thing,
is to do a video.

158
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,620
Maybe we should focus
on, like, our fashion of working out.

159
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,324
Like, we both look good.
We have a cool style and like...

160
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,626
I mean, I like doing things together.

161
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,199
I do really love Kourt.
I want to help her find her passion,

162
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:49,001
but I have already started a fitness line
with Good American.

163
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:53,706
Like, I normally buy sweats that are sets,
but then the pants are cool enough

164
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,809
{\an8}where I wear them
with just, like, a sheer bodysuit.

165
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,445
{\an8}So it's still, like, sexy, edgy,
like, streetwear.

166
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,715
[Khloé] I have to ask Good American
if I could even stop that process

167
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,717
to do this fitness line with Kourtney.

168
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,853
Somehow I have to figure that out,
I guess.

169
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,757
The fact that we are somewhat in sync
with our wardrobe,

170
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,426
we're already off to a great start.

171
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,097
Ah! We can't even coordinate slaps?

172
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,435
-Yeah.
-Just three.

173
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,936

00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,077
{\an8}[piano keys playing]

175
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,013
I don't know how to play anything.

176
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,083
-[Kim] I don't either.
-[off-key music]

177
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,851
North knows how to play more than me.

178
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,086
-[Kendall] Really?
-[Kim] Yeah.

179
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,120
[Kendall] That's cute.

180
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,322
-[Kim] Um...
-[phone chimes]

181
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,827
So, how's life?

182
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,996
Oh, my God,
I'm going to kill Kylie right now.

183
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,332
We're throwing one of my really
good friends a birthday party,

184
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,035
and, like, he's literally the best person
in the entire world.

185
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,237
We can't just go to dinner. Like,
we need to do something where we're like,

186
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,373
"Yo, we love you, like,
this is what we want to do for you."

187
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,875
So, we're like, why don't we just,
like, have, like, a carnival for him?

188
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,410
Oh, my God, how fun.

189
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,079
And then Kylie ends up starting to plan
this whole thing.

190
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:11,217
Literally, like, picked so much stuff
and had so much going on.

191
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,487
[Kendall] Like, we don't want... Like, it's
not supposed to be this, like, full thing.

192
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,388
Yeah.

193
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,857
So now Kylie just sent
a whole text saying,

194
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,459
"No, no, no, like, what the [bleep]?
Why are you taking stuff off?

195
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,329
It's gonna be lame. It's gonna be lame."
I said, "Kylie, you don't understand.

196
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,097
We just wanna go to your house
and hang out."

197
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,166
[tense music]

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,335
That's so frustrating.

199
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,806
It's crazy, because Kylie and I
will, like, start with an initial idea,

200
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,374
we'll both get involved in it,

201
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,377
and then I think that, like,
somewhere along the line,

202
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,147
she gets, like, bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger.

203
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,715
[Kendall] And that's so not me.

204
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:46,686
So at the end of it,
we, like, come back to it,

205
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,656
and there's two completely different ideas
or, like, perceptions.

206
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,025
So we end up butting heads sometimes,

207
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:57,129
but I'm more mad at myself for just
getting myself into this situation.

208
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,066
{\an8}[upbeat music]

209
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,004
{\an8}[Khloé] P, I love that you like salads
so much.

210
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,839
-I like those.
-[gasps]

211
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,841
Oh, yeah, why can't you eat those again?

212
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,776
Because they're not gluten-free.

213
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,878
-Man.
-And they're yummy.

214
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,048
-[Khloé] I know. That stinks.
-She snuck a couple.

215
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,950
[gasps]
You snuck a couple?

216
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,185
-What?
-Yeah.

217
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,219
-[Khloé] How many?
-Two.

218
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,656
[gasps]
What? It's okay, I won't tell anyone.

219
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,690
[shushes]

220
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,359
Don't tell Mason.

221
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:30,730
I think I could definitely start
with at least the design meetings.

222
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,166
I just want you to, like,
take it seriously. I know you do,

223
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,503
but sometimes, because of your kids
and you're so busy...

224
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,404
Yeah.

225
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,007
...that you don't really complete
or, like, follow through.

226
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:46,312
No, but I'm happy to also take over
with Nima and have the design convos,

227
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,514
since, like, if you're not in town
or whatever.

228
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:52,351
I want to be involved because you and I
have a little different aesthetic.

229
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,188
I have put
my fitness clothing line on hold

230
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,157
because I like working with my sisters.

231
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,827
And I think it would be fun and great
for us to do that venture together.

232
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,164
[Khloé] My partners are obviously
really disappointed.

233
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,434
We've put a lot of time and money
into the fitness line already.

234
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,336
But I love working with Kourt.

235
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,772
I love that she's passionate
and excited about something.

236
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:17,243
So I'm fine tabling my Good American
athleisure line for a minute.

237
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,545
I need to see how passionate Kourtney is,

238
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,915
but I will say,
the stakes are really high.

239
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,819
You don't get second chances really,
in fashion. Not right out of the gate.

240
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,021
You really are gonna have to earn
those stripes.

241
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:34,860
If you do want to take the lead and start
some of those conversations, that's great.

242
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,963
And I also think,
not that you owe me anything,

243
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,133
but I also think it would prove to me
that you're taking this seriously.

244
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,034
Okay.

245
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,037
And it'll make me feel like getting in bed
with you even more.

246
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,306
Maybe this time, naked.

247
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,010
[upbeat music]

248
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,651
When I did media training,
it was so helpful for me

249
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,220
just to be aware of the things I'm saying.

250
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:05,925
So I just don't think the answer
is to retreat.

251
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,761
You have to be prepared that someday

252
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,230
you might get asked a question
that you don't want to answer,

253
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,299
and you should just,
instead of getting flustered,

254
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,267
you should just be really prepared for it.

255
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,603
[Kim] You just have to start
being like a boss.

256
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,572
-Yeah.
-You know? Like you really have to,

257
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:23,275
like, change your whole vibe. It's time.

-Nice to meet you too. Thank you.

a lot of video of you.

-Hi, Kendall! Jen.
-Hi. How are you?

-Kendall. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,871
-[Bill] Bill. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

272
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,640
Do you guys watch the interviews
that you've done

273
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,541
-after?
-[Khloé] I don't.

274
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,442
-You don't?
-[Kim] No.

275
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,178
I watch my kids 'cause it's my job,
but I can't...

276
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:03,582
Well, I don't care to watch myself
because I don't want to know. I just...

277
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,384
What I don't know can't hurt me.

278
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,153
-We're gonna change that today.
-[Bill] Yeah.

279
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:11,023
Because that really needs to become
a part of how you're going to get better.

280
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,527
[Bill] Right. There is maybe
a legion of people out there

281
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,962
who still have the narrative of, like...

282
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,799
{\an8}Okay, so what are you guys famous for
besides being famous?

283
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,867
And every time you go out
to do an interview,

284
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,371
you have the opportunity
for somebody to read that or see that

285
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,474
and say, "Wow, did you see that interview
with one of the Kardashian girls?

286
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,843
That was really impressive.
She was really thoughtful.

287
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,646
They seemed like really savvy, smart,
like, businesswomen."

288
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,147
-[Kris] Yeah.
-Okay, so,

289
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,650
this is one thing
that I think is really, really critical,

290
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:42,154
and that is, we're all gonna be
in situations where we're feeling anxious.

291
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,658
When that happens,
we get this shot of adrenaline,

292
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,293
and when you start speaking faster,

293
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,161
you have less control
over what you're saying.

294
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:53,465
So you have to fight your body
and talk a little bit more slowly,

295
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,535
a little bit more deliberately,
you know, downshift,

296
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,104
and don't speed through everything.

297
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,306
[Kris] What I need help with,

298
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,575
in that case,

299
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:06,111
there are a few things in my life
I don't want to talk about. I'm done.

300
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,882
I think we're trying to get people
to not be, "I won't talk about that."

301
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,984
[Jen] You want to take
the emotion out of it. Right?

302
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:16,288
Because that's exactly what the reporter
is looking for, is to get under your skin.

303
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,556
Before we do an interview,

304
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,526
let's think of all the things
that we don't want to talk about.

305
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,963
And let's really be thoughtful
about how we can talk about it.

306
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,068
Maybe, Kris, if you knew exactly
what you wanted to say about Caitlyn,

307
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,836
and really thought about it in advance,

308
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,306
you probably would be
in a much better position to respond.

309
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,310
I just think, with the overall strategy,
my mom has done so much,

310
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,681
but I don't think she gets, like,
the accolades that she really deserves.

311
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,851
So I really want to, like, push her
to start positioning herself

312
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:50,289
as the strong businesswoman
and mogul that she is.

313
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,559
You know, my mom,
she had her own talk show,

314
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,495
she was so confident doing interviews,

315
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,099
and I just think
her recent life experiences

316
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:04,770
has just made her more insecure
and not really confident.

317
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,805
And she just doesn't
really know what to say.

318
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,507
I think she just has her guard up.

319
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,678
And she just, like, needs to have
this, like, comeback and figure it out

320
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,314
and get back to being confident again.

321
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,083
Is everybody clear
on what we're gonna do next?

322
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,051
-No. What?
-No. What are we doing next?

323
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,287
[Bill] We're gonna do a group interview.

324
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,122
-[Jen] A mock interview.
-[Khloé] No.

325
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,323
-[Kim] Okay.
-[Khloé] Oh, God.

326
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,127
And, uh, we're gonna videotape it
and then we're gonna play it back.

327
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,829
-And we're gonna offer our feedback...
-[Khloé] Perfect.

328
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,065
...on what works and what we could tweak.

329
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,066
[Khloé] Okay.

330
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,567
[Kris] Okay.

331
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,303
I think I've gotten to a place in my life

332
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:41,907
where I just really don't like questions
from press and media.

333
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,909
[Kris] It's a lot of work
to be front and center.

334
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,811
It's easier to stay in the background.

335
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,148
It is. It is a lot of pressure,
but I think it's, like, fascinating

336
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:54,286
that we all have been doing
media interviews for a decade,

337
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,155
and we've never had media training.

338
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,624
And that's usually
one of the first things that you do

339
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:03,729
when you start off in this business,
so I can't wait for them to do it.

340
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,631
[Kim] Okay, phones down, ladies.

341
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,400
-Let's pretend that this is...
-You're Megyn Kelly.

342
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,703
-[Jen] We're on a Megyn Kelly...
-And Piers Morgan.

343
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,539
So <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> has called it

344
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:18,510
"The Kardashian Decade: How a Sex Tape
Led to a Billion-Dollar Brand."

345
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,845
-What do you guys attribute...
-[whoops]

346
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,146
...to this longevity?

347
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,783
Why are people so fascinated
by you guys ten years later?

348
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,886
I think that the authenticity
of our family really rings through,

349
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:32,391
and I think that with any one of us
I think you're able to connect.

350
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,994
You could relate to Kim or someone
could be obsessed with Kendall.

351
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,697
And I think, um,
following our lives so closely,

352
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,066
they really feel
they're along for that ride

353
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,701
because we have been so open and honest.

354
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,103
Like they're invested.

355
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,704
Do you need the show to do that?

356
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,240
After the life of the show,
whenever that is,

357
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,476
does this still hold together?

358
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,945
I think that the show
is a wonderful foundation

359
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,313
for everything else that we do,

360
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,150
and I think that because so many people
got emotionally invested,

361
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,519
season one, episode one,

362
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,789
and have seen the family through
everything that we've been through,

363
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,758
so it's everything.

364
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,293
We show whatever is going on in our lives.

365
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,699
So it's divorce, you know, marriages,
uh, you know, births,

366
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,102
every single thing that happens
in our lives, they get to experience.

367
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,538
And I don't think
we've ever let them down on that.

368
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,775
Well, I think... I don't know if we're
answering the question, what she's asking.

369
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,411
-I think that what she's asking is...
-Can it go on without us?

370
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,379
Yes, and I think absolutely
because I think that...

371
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,547
-Social media.
-Exactly.

372
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,183
I think that social media
is such a big thing today,

373
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,152
-and you were done.
-Took me a minute to get that.

374
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,621
-This is a real interview, so...
-Yeah, you guys, this is a real interview.

375
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:40,059
But can you have the unity of the family
on social media like you do on television?

376
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,027
You know what, I feel like our show

377
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,897
definitely gives different layers
to our lives.

378
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,299
It's like an onion, and you're pulling
all those layers back.

379
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,670
I think you do see our dynamic on Snapchat
when there's video involved. You do see...

380
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:56,075
You can't fully express your personality
the same way, I think,

381
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,910
that we do on our show.

382
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,811
Yeah.

383
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,813
So we're screwed when the show's over.

384
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:01,747
[bleep]

385
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,315
[laughs]

386
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,952
Kris, looking back, were there signs
that Bruce, at the time,

387
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,855
wanted to become a woman?
Did you turn a blind eye?

388
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,257
[tense music]

389
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,358
Um...

390
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,964
No, I don't think I turned a blind eye.

391
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:23,902
I think I just didn't have the whole truth
of what was going on in his life.

392
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,474
But you didn't see it
because of the proximity?

393
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,275
[Bill] I mean, you were incredibly close.

394
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,746
[tense music]

395
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:38,750
Kris, looking back, were there signs
that Bruce, at the time,

396
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,653
wanted to become a woman?
Did you turn a blind eye?

397
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,556
No, I don't think I turned a blind eye.

398
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:49,728
I think I just didn't have the whole truth
of what was going on in his life.

399
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,030
But you didn't see it
because of the proximity?

400
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,266
-[Bill] I mean, you were incredibly close.
-[Kris] No.

401
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,568
[Kendall] We kept a lot of it from you.
Like, we were...

402
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,737
-Like, we were a little team.
-[Bill] Did you know that?

403
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,805
Did you know a lot of it

404
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,374
-was being kept from you?
-No, not until I actually read the book.

405
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,043
[Kris] There's things that happened
that I... that they didn't tell me

406
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,279
-because they were told not to.
-Are you resentful about that now?

407
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,149
I'm not resentful about it.
It just makes me really sad

408
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:14,052
because I'm a protective mom.
I would do anything for my kids.

409
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,356
And had I known what some of the things
they were experiencing,

410
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,324
especially Kendall and Kylie.

411
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,594
I mean, it just broke my heart, you know,
hearing some of that stuff.

412
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,464
Talking about decisions
you could have back.

413
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:30,135
Kendall, you have the opportunity
to not do that ad.

414
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,538
You're telling me... You're giving me,
like, a hypothetical...

415
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,274
-Yes. Do you do it still or not?
-[Kendall] Um...

416
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,476
Because there... there was a huge outcry

417
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,745
that you were just tone-deaf
about the whole thing.

418
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,748
I think it was definitely
a huge learning lesson.

419
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,550
It never went through your mind
when you read the script?

420
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,718
There were a lot of things
that were blinding me.

421
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,088
There were a lot of people I had faith in,
there were a lot of things I had trust in.

422
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,857
You blame your managers?

423
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,727
-[Jen] Or in this case, Mom?
-Um, actually, no, not this time.

424
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,597
-On that note.
-Okay, yeah, let's end it there. Good.

425
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,265
-Thank you.
-[Kim] Thank you.

426
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,169
[Jen] So now we're gonna look at it
and do some messaging work around it.

427
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,073
Okay, let's... let's watch.

428
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,776
[Jen] <i>The Hollywood Reporter has called it</i>

429
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:15,714
<i>"The Kardashian Decade: How a Sex Tape
Led to a Billion-Dollar Brand."</i>

430
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,417
Kris, interestingly, your eyes dropped

431
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,653
-when Jen got to the mention of the tape.
-[Kris] I know.

432
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,657
I think try to keep that eye contact
and not look like, "Ugh."

433
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,725
You know? Almost like that

434
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,794
-poked in the ribs a little bit.
-[Kim] Don't be ashamed.

435
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,262
-[Bill] Yeah.
-[Bill and Jen laugh]

436
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,463
[Kim] I'm just kidding.

437
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,667
[Jen] <i>Were there signs that Bruce,
at the time, wanted to become a woman?</i>

438
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,702
<i>Did you turn a blind eye?</i>

439
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:38,704
<i>No.</i>

440
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,074
So that tone of voice
definitely sounded a little defensive.

441
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,408
-[Kris] I know.
-[imitates Kris] "No."

442
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,677
This is where I wish
I could say it concisely.

443
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,646
It's like, there's two truths.

444
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,914
More than half of the marriage,

445
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,417
it was, like, a picture-perfect
two people in love, having kids,

446
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,486
doing this, doing that, travel,
so excited.

447
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:58,690
Like, I wouldn't have seen that truth
in a gazillion years.

448
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,561
People's truths at the end, the truth
is so different than in the beginning.

449
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,063
-You just said your own answer.
-I know, I feel like that was the answer.

450
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,799
-Yeah, that was perfect.
-But this is how authentic you need to be.

451
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,870
-Like, this passionate instead of, "No."
-But how do I say that in two minutes?

452
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,672
You did. You just did.

453
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,374
[Kris] Because that sounds like
such a long story.

454
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,211
I think you're trying to play it
too guarded, too safe on this.

455
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,646
-Yeah.
-Because what happened here,

456
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,114
-you're saying it off-line...
-[Kris] 'Cause I feel, like,

457
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,749
-it's too different.
-...and you totally went for it.

458
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,851
-Yeah.
-And it was truth. And it worked.

459
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,954
Yeah. Because that's my truth.

460
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,423
<i>Well, I think, I don't know if we're...</i>

461
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,660
-[Kim] They're having such a hard time.
-We say "I think" four million times.

462
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,862
-[Bill] Yes.
-[Kendall] I say "like" a million times.

463
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,930
No, we all... I hope you know we all...

464
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,901
Most of us start our sentences
or after the first two words

465
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:47,105
say, "I think," or we say, "I think,"
like, we say "I think" a lot.

466
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,443
If you actually put thought

467
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,413
behind what are the first five words
out of my mouth

468
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,983
when I go to open them, they will not be...

469
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,619
[Bill] It'll be real content
instead of just sound.

470
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,322
As you do more
and more business interviews,

471
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,792
and you project yourselves
as the successful businesswomen you are,

472
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:10,062
that's really important.
Be cleaner out of the gate.

473
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,496
[Jen] Yeah.

474
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,900
Kendall, look at your body language here
when this comes up.

475
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,903
[Bill] <i>You have the opportunity
to not do that ad.</i>

476
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,872
<i>You're telling me... You're giving me,
like, a hypothetical...</i>

477
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,408
[Bill] <i>Yes. Do you do it still or not?</i>

478
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,478
I think maybe tackle this
a little bit more directly.

479
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,380
Here's what I would do differently.

480
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,450
Well, it's such a difficult question
because it is hypothetical,

481
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,951
and that's not what happened.

482
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,588
So the fans really, I think,
turned a little bit,

483
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,990
or that's when Kendall
had her first controversy

484
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:42,561
is because the Kardashian side
has always been so open.

485
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,830
So if that would've happened to us,
we would've spoken right away.

486
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,166
You guys have never dealt
with something of this magnitude.

487
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,203
You could talk about
having a false sense of security

488
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,904
dealing with such a huge brand.

489
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:57,242
There's a certain assumption
that this creative is gonna be great.

490
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,211
And it blew up in their face.

491
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,245
Yeah.

492
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:04,282
I have learned so much over the last,
like, four years of my career.

493
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,852
[Kendall]
I've learned that the only person

494
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,288
that's ever gonna truly, truly,
truly look out for me is me.

495
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,290
And, like, it is really hard work.

496
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:16,094
So you can see where the...
Maybe one of the overriding takeaways here

497
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:20,766
is give your answers in the affirmative,
not the absence of the negative.

498
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,700
[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

499
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:26,004
It projects a much more confident demeanor
behind your answers.

500
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,539
-[Khloé] Okay.
-[phone chimes]

501
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,641
[Kendall] Kylie is so crazy.

502
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,346
Bro, this is making me, like, upset.
I'm just like, "Are you serious?"

503
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,850
I thought Kylie and I came to an agreement
about this whole party planning situation,

504
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,620
and she's saying that
we have to bring everything back,

505
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,122
and she doesn't think it's gonna be
good enough without everything.

506
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,391
So it's really starting to piss me off.

507
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,860
[phone chimes]

508
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,897
[Kendall] It's just, like,
one thing after another.

509
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,800
This just killed my vibe.
I need to go home.

510
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,068
But don't you think
you would really benefit from this?

511
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,137
I'm literally going home.

512
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,843
[tense music]

513
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,778
-[Kendall] I have to get out of here.
-[Bill] So nice working with you.

514
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,146
-[Kendall] Okay.
-[Jen] Good luck.

515
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:13,452
{\an8}Fortunately, for us, just about everybody
who is a host or an interviewer

516
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,353
{\an8}asks a question the same way.

517
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,756
Before they actually ask you the question,

518
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:22,360
they like to show off that they know
a thing or two about you and the topic.

519
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,995
-[Jen] Context.
-[Bill] Context, right.

520
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:28,133
What you want to do is listen
to that contextual setup for keywords

521
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,135
as to where this is going.

522
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,938
Start thinking about what it is
you want to say in the question.

523
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:33,972
Got it.

524
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,207
[Bill] I think we're ready
for one-on-ones.

525
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,209
[Jen] I think we're ready
for the one-on-ones.

526
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,312
We often say to people

527
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,048
that we want the interviews
we do with them in practice

528
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,784
to be among the harder ones
that they would face

529
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,954
so that they're not shocked
by any questions out there.

530
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,889
Go ahead.

531
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,158
You are closest to Rob.

532
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,595
Lately, he seems to be having
some erratic behavior.

533
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,896
[Jen] What's going on with him?

534
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,665
Um, you know, Rob definitely
wears his heart on his sleeve,

535
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,834
and when he loves,
he loves really, really hard.

536
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,636
And with that being said,

537
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,838
when he gets hurt,
he hurts really, really badly.

538
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:12,611
Kourtney, I'm curious about your decision
to have your kids have such a public life.

539
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,778
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.
-To be in the show.

540
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:18,416
Scott is front and center.
His infidelity, his drinking problems.

541
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,351
[Kourtney chuckles]

542
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,187
The kids will be able
to, like, find these shows online.

543
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,889
[Jen] How will you explain it to them?

544
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,291
[laughs]
I'll just say none of it's true.

545
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:31,096
Today, you've found love again
with a man who's 26 years younger.

546
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,297
Is he 26 years younger?

547
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,166
-[Jen] That's what the reports say.
-Wow. Okay.

548
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,202
So, what's going on with you and Corey?

549
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,505
Will you marry him?
Are you going to get remarried?

550
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:44,676
I don't think I would ever feel the need
to ever get married again.

551
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,612
You stuck by Lamar,
but when it came to Caitlyn,

552
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,248
you didn't seem to have
that same understanding. Why is that?

553
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:54,185
You know what? I actually was really
understanding and supportive of Caitlyn.

554
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:58,189
Um, I think that the public
has a different perception.

555
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:02,794
Kourtney, I imagine you're deluged
with proposals, business partnerships.

556
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,196
What are some of the things
that you're looking for

557
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,365
in order to decide
whether you want to be involved?

558
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,401
I think, at this point in my life,

559
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:13,705
you know, it's already a lot to balance
being a mom and working,

560
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:19,578
so I really am only taking on projects
that I'm really passionate about.

561
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,781
What were some of the most hurtful things
in Caitlyn's book?

562
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,452
Some of the most... Well, I think
just the general tone of the book.

563
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,988
-Was it mean-spirited?
-[Kris] Very mean-spirited.

564
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:34,593
A lot of inaccuracies. I think somebody
with a little elegance and class,

565
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,028
and somebody that's been divorced,

566
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,564
but trying to stay on good terms
with the family

567
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,168
might have written,
"Wow. Married to her, didn't work out.

568
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,304
You know, she's a great girl.
Wish it could've been different."

569
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,173
Okay. Let's stop there.

570
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,274
Thank you.

571
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,775
-[Kourtney] Okay.
-Okay.

572
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:56,915
Well, that wasn't fun, but I realized
that the only person that I can control

573
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,218
and how I react
and respond to anything is myself.

574
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:05,657
And I truly do see some value
in this whole process.

575
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:09,294
[Jen] <i>It appears, by watching the show,
that you're closest to Rob,</i>

576
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,430
<i>and lately, he seems to be having some...</i>

577
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:16,468
So nodding through this, you know,
kind of validating he's erratic.

578
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,269
I mean, it was crazy.

579
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,270
[laughs]

580
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:23,341
There's also a value of equating yourself
with other families.

581
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,344
You know,
you are this subject of interest,

582
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,481
but to make what happens
in the Kardashians universal,

583
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:33,184
reminds the audience that this
kind of stuff goes on in your family too.

584
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,986
-Right.
-And like any family,

585
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,521
-this is what we did.
-Okay.

586
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:41,026
[Jen] <i>Scott is front and center.
His infidelity, his drinking problems.</i>

587
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,394
[chuckles]

588
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,429
[Bill] Um, were you gonna comment
on the laugh?

589
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,400
Yeah. We're talking about
something really serious, about your kids

590
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:53,238
and the potential for them to see
some pretty disturbing video of them.

591
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,606
And you're laughing.

592
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,241
-Yeah.
-It was probably a nervous laugh.

593
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:59,577
No, of course, but I feel like
it, like, lightens the mood a little.

594
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:03,348
But the perception is that
you're not taking this seriously.

595
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,216
-[Bill] That's right.
-And that you don't really have a plan

596
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,119
-for your kids when that time does come.
-Yeah. Yeah.

597
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,087
Yeah.

598
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,655
[Jen] <i>Did you ever read Caitlyn's book?</i>

599
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,624
-<i>I did.</i>
-[Jen] <i>You did?</i>

600
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,260
<i>I think somebody that's been divorced,</i>

601
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,696
<i>but trying to stay on good terms
with the family</i>

602
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:21,499
<i>might have written,
"Wow. Married to her, didn't work out.</i>

603
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,568
<i>She's a great girl.
Wish it could've been different."</i>

604
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:26,471
I mean, you could, if you wanted
to push it a little further, say,

605
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,240
"But of course, we all know that
that doesn't sell books."

606
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,775
-That's a good one.
-Right.

607
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,878
We live our entire lives
in front of the whole world,

608
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,581
and questions like this
are gonna keep coming

609
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,516
for as long as I can foresee,

610
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:42,253
so it really does help to have some skills
under my belt

611
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,225
to be able to help just convey
what I'm trying to say.

612
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,259
-Bye.
-[Khloé] Bye, Keeks.

613
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:49,227
[Kourtney] Bye.

614
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,196
-Bye, kiddo.
-Thanks for hooking us up with this.

615
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,698
-[Kris] Good advice.
-[Bill] Good, excellent.

616
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,834
[Khloé] It was great.
You got so much better.

617
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,202
-[Bill] Really good, Kris, yeah.
-[Jen] Yeah.

618
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,003
Just in between the first
and the second interview.

619
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,538
-[Bill] Really good.
-Good.

620
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,607
-Thank you for coming all the way...
-[Bill] Thank you.

621
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,010
...and helping us get better
at what we can't do very well.

622
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,645
-[Bill] Of course.
-I learned a lot.

623
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,680
[Bill, Jen] Good.

624
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,981
[Khloé] Mom, you learned a lot too.

625
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,017
-I could tell.
-I want to do it again.

626
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,352
[laughs]

627
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,020
[upbeat music]

628
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:25,964
{\an8}[Kim] Look at them. Snapchatting.

629
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,799
We're trying to work out,
20 minutes of just...

630
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,134
-I'm trying to turn on music!
-Great.

631
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,104
[Kim] <i>No, you're Snapchatting.
We need to [bleep] work out.</i>

632
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:36,274
This is dedication. Back to the grind.

633
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,510
[Kourtney] Oh, I know
what I wanted to do, Khlo,

634
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,712
was go to Russell Simmons' place.

635
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,115
[Khloé] When? Tomorrow?

636
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,216
-[Kourtney] No, no, no.
-[Kim] Why?

637
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:50,155
He has a workout line at his yoga place.
He's like, "I have the best manufacturer.

638
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:55,160
They only do workout clothes."
And the partner owns Westfield malls.

639
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,962
[Kourtney] That's why I'm almost,
like, do I just...

640
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:01,699
I feel like Mom needs to find us
the best workout distributor.

641
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,001
You need the best of the best.

642
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,704
I already told you that.
I said the place that I love, that I...

643
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,873
-[Kourtney] Lycra.
-I gave you their workout pants and...

644
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,775
Yeah. I didn't like their prints.

645
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,578
No, I never said the prints.
I gave it to you for quality.

646
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,481
I told you they are the best quality,
but they're in Australia.

647
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,417
And they love me and they said
they would help me with whatever I need.

648
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,853
But you were like,
"No, let's do it this way."

649
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,523
Kourtney and I are a nothing-brand
right now.

650
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,492
And we're just not seeing eye to eye.

651
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,694
[Jonathan] Are you doing the '80s thing
with the socks and the whole...

652
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,396
-Yes.
-[Khloé] No, it's already expired.

653
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,932
It's now the year 2030 all of a sudden.

654
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,235
I have got it styled.
So we're gonna go Daft Punk.

655
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,704
Oh, my God. What is she talking about now?

656
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,841
[Khloé] Doing the fitness video took
at least a year to get off the ground.

657
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,710
So if this fitness line
is gonna go anywhere

658
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,679
in the same direction
like the fitness video,

659
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,113
I want nothing to do with it.

660
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,083
Sometimes, I love having a partner,
but when you're just not in sync,

661
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,585
it's a little frustrating.

662
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,756
{\an8}[upbeat music]

663
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,664
Hello?

-[Kourtney] Hello.
-[Khloé] Hi.

-Hello, Reigny. Hello.
-You know Khloé's my mom, right?

-Reigny, who is your mom?
-Meow.

-Are you a kitty?
-Meow, meow.

668

Meow, meow. Say, "I'm your kitty, Mom."
Meow, meow.

-Meow.
-[Khloé] Meow!

00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,219
Okay, Mama Jo.
I've got some serious business.

671
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,856
We were in the talks
of doing the fitness line,

672
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,491
and I put everything on hold.

673
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:38,930
It doesn't really seem like this train
is moving at the speed I want it to move.

674
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,400
And I was hoping you and I
could do something together.

675
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,468
But...

676
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,271
For now, I think that it's smart for me
to move forward with Good American

677
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,472
and doing this kind of stuff.

678
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,341
Okay.

679
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,077
Go for it, girl.

680
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,446
I think that Khloé really
was looking to me

681
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:59,484
to do a lot of the legwork
for the fitness line.

682
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,421
I need more of a balance
between work and being a mom.

683
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,691
And I think we just have
really different priorities.

684
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,961
Did someone give you a pill today,
and you didn't ask what it was?

685
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,797
Because especially, this is a whole
new you that I'm talking to.

686
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,766
Literally, I can't even
talk about it anymore.

687
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,101
I'm not saying that I'm not...

688
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,803
Happy to see it go?

689
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,807
No, no, no.
I'm not the fastest-moving person...

690
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,876
[Khloé] You know what?
God bless you for saying that.

691
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,779
And guess what,
I know that I procrastinate.

692
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,181
-Wow.
-I know that I don't have follow-through.

693
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,850
That's why I need a partner
that has those things.

694
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:33,885
But you can't solely

695
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,386
-rely on other people.
-[Kourtney] And pushes me.

696
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,789
[Khloé] You're like Nate Dogg,
you're only good for hooks.

697
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,624
-Yup.
-[Khloé] You can't sell your own album.

698
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:40,992
[Kourtney] Nope. I don't want to.

699
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:42,427
Meow.

700
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,729
Like, even in this conversation,
you're removed.

701
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,764
-[Khloé] You're pretty cute.
-[Kourtney] It's the face of an angel.

702
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,933
The cutest kid ever born.

703
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,268
You have two other ones.

704
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,536
Doesn't matter.

705
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,004
[scoffs]

706
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:56,007
I guess people
really do have favorites, huh, Reign?

707
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,375
[Reign] He's my friend.

708
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,509
Who's your friend?

709
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,978
-Here.
-[Khloé laughs]

710
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,012
You have a friend here?

711
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,814
[Reign] Oh, yeah, a monster.

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,550
-A monster?
-[Reign] Aah! He's a monster!

-[Kareem] My pleasure.
-I haven't seen you a long time ago.

724

{\an8}You meet five million people a day,
but it's good to see you.

725
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,878
I think I go up to your waist,
and I'm tall.

726
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,781
I've been shying away
from interviews lately,

727
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,385
but after doing the media training,
I do feel a bit more confident.

728
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,388
<i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> has asked me
to do an interview with them

729
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:47,291
and have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
be the guy who does the interview.

730
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:52,663
He is one of basketball's
biggest superstars, and I love Kareem.

731
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,367
And I've always loved
<i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, so...

732
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,037
it's a match.

733
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:04,475
You've become, uh, symbolic
of a highly effective business manager.

734
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,211
Do you see that your...
your business management style...

735
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,014
do you see that as your principal legacy?

736
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:15,153
I think so. I mean, my legacy
is definitely my family and my kids.

737
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,054
It's like the perfect storm

738
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:21,192
because I was able to work
with my kids every single day.

739
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,361
And at the same time, I'm their mom,

740
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,564
so I had their best interests in mind
at all times

741
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:30,835
and was able to navigate
this very complicated world

742
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:35,840
of entertainment meets modeling
meets the endorsement world

743
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,642
meets corporate America.

744
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:42,413
And I think that it's been really
successful because we trust each other.

745
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,916
[tense music]

746
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,921
{\an8}Are you comfortable with the sexual nature
of the photos

747
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,924
{\an8}and Instagrams
that your daughters have put out there?

748
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,293
Because your grandchildren
are gonna have to deal

749
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,762
with, uh, some embarrassment and teasing.

750
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:05,002
I am very comfortable at this point
if they're comfortable.

751
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,473
I think if something is leaked
or it's out there

752
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,609
and they haven't had anything to do
with that, you know,

753
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,911
-then you can't control everything.
-Right.

754
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,180
[Kris] But I think it just depends
on what it is.

755
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,817
I'm always proud of everything
that they do.

756
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:25,223
I think it's amazing, and I think
that they give other women confidence

757
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,860
and the ability to feel really great
about who they are.

758
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:34,665
So there's a lot of power and...
and self-esteem that comes with...

759
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:38,970
and strength that comes
with being comfortable in your own skin.

760
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,339
As long as they are...
are comfortable with it,

761
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,609
and it's done in a way
that they see as tasteful and...

762
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,844
-Exactly.
-...and, uh, uh...

763
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,980
exemplary of who they are.

764
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,448
[Kris] Exactly.

765
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,752
You've been very open
about your own plastic surgery.

766
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,188
You say, "A girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do."

767
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,725
But does that send a message
to young women that, you know,

768
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,162
their looks are the most important parts
of who they are?

769
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:10,835
I don't think so. I think that everybody
has their own beauty at different ages.

770
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,238
So I think that if something
that you want to do

771
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,408
makes you feel better about yourself,
then why not?

772
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,710
I think everybody has to make
their own choice.

773
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,182
I think the experience
of going to the media training

774
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,716
was very helpful for me

775
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,986
because it's taught me that I set the tone
and the mood.

776
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,722
And if I choose to do an interview
with somebody,

777
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,959
I now know,
just expect the tough questions,

778
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,962
have some sense of preparedness,

779
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,898
so that I feel confident
in answering the question.

780
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,535
Great. Well, hey, thanks for answering
all my questions.

781
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,570
Of course.

782
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,372
[Kareem] You've been wonderful,
and I really appreciate it.

783
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,274
-[Kris] Can I ask you a question?
-By all means.

784
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,642
[Kris] Okay. How tall are you?

785
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,946
Uh, I was 7'2".
I'm starting to shrink a little bit.

[laughs]

787
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,715
It doesn't look like
you're shrinking to me.

788
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,618
Old age has kind of squished me
down a little bit.

789
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,819
[Kris] How old are you?

790
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,987

in a million years.

796
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,200
Well, you know, I've spent some time,
you know, in my house

797

looking in the sofa and the bed
and a number of chairs,

[Khloé] It's my favorite part.

806
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,230
Something that was so discouraging for me
when I was working with my sisters more

807
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,466
is that I always felt like my voice
didn't really matter,

808
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,534
because Kourtney and Kim
are so like-minded

809
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,103
that I always got overruled.

810
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,405
And I don't want to go backwards.

811
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,441
[Khloé] I really love where I am
as a businesswoman right now.

812
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,944
[upbeat music]

813
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:04,048
I love that my opinions matter

814
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,952
and that I'm able to make such strong
executive decisions right now.

815
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,121
[photographer]
That looks great. Very good.

816
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:14,258
Now that Kourtney and I are not gonna be
doing our athleisure line together,

817
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,228
Good American is back as a go.

818
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,431
Oh, don't be shy.

819
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,235
I'm so honored and proud of all of us,
so thank you guys so much.

820
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,003
-I echo what she says!
-Okay.

821
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,972
[Emma] Everything Good American!

822
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,741
Cheers, guys! Cheers! Drink!

823
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,045
{\an8}[upbeat music]

824
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,952
{\an8}-[Kendall] Are you sick?
-[Kim] Yeah.

825
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,255
[Kourtney] She always hangs out sick.

826
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,890
You should just give a warning,

827
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,326
-"Stay five feet away."
-[Kim] I think I got it under control.

828
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,561
Yesterday was really bad,
and then I just came home.

829
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,396
Here's my trick, you sleep it off.

830
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,965
You try to go to bed really early,
like, 8:00 PM,

831
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,600
and then you sleep through the night.

832
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,337
And then you wake up,
and you're 50 percent better.

833
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,605
-I don't believe that.
-[Kim] Sleep totally cures it.

834
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,208
I'm a good sleeper
and I sleep all the time.

835
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,744
And when I'm sick, it doesn't help.

836
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,579
Did you talk to Kylie?

837
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:11,282
Uh, yeah, I did.

838
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,284
[tense music]

839
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,990
It's crazy because Kylie and I,

840
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,859
there's always something
between her and I.

841
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:25,496
[Kendall] We fought yesterday,
and then when I left media training,

842
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,932
I went to go speak to her,
and she came over last night.

843
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,900
She, like, fell asleep
and she stayed at my house.

844
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,869
That's just, like, sister [bleep].
Like, we fight,

845
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,604
and then she literally came over
that night

846
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,040
and helped me make a whole dinner
for me and 20 of my friends.

847
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,408
And it's, like, fine now.

848
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,877
-[laughs]
-[indistinct chatter]

849
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,679
So we... we end up butting heads sometimes,

850
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,081
but at the end of the day,
she's my sister.

851
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,487
[Kim] Kourtney, Khloé and I get like this
all the time.

[tense music]

854
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,660
Who are you texting over here?

855
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,099
Uh, my friend...

856
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,904
{\an8}-who's about to go to bed.
-[Kim] Mm.

857
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,607
Mm.

Let's raise a glass
to Kris [bleep] Jenner.

864
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,954
This wild, wild west is not for me.

[Larsa] Call 911.

866
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,058
[Khloé] Do you know what's going on
with Rob, with custody?

867
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,528
-Why don't you call and ask him?
-[Rob] <i>Nothing's going on.</i>

868
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,998
There's no way Rob and Chyna
could get back together after this, right?

869
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,232
-Totally.
-[phone rings]

870
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,333
Hi, Kylie.

871
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,036
What? Should we have her arrested?

872
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,372
[Khloé] Lately,
things have been weird between us.

873
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,007
I don't even know what this is.

874
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,009

You're the pit bull in the family.

875
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,777
-Nobody likes to ruffle your feathers.
-[sighs]

876
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,848
-[Kim] How are you feeling? Are you okay?
-I just, like, get anxiety sometimes.

877
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,850
Do you want me to come take you
to the hospital?

878
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:56,720
-[woman] Kim Kardashian West.
-[Kim] Did you guys see what was on TMZ?

879
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,390
-Sue the [bleep] out of them.
-What's going on?

880
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,692
I'm so sick of people,
like, not saying anything.

881
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,195
Swear to God,
I'm gonna lock myself in a funny farm.

883

Did you not know?

884
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,866
-No.
-[Malika] Are you kidding me?

885
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,268
Oh, my God!
