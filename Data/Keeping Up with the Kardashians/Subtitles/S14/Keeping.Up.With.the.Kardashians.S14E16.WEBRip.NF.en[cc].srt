2
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,810
{\an8}[Kim] Would want it, like, more like this.

3
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:13,146
I'll be quite honest,
I don't even know what this room is.

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,247
Nursery.

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,351
So like, the little open tub, crib...

6
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,087
-[Scott] For another baby?
-Maybe.

7
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,624
Do you really think you need to worry
about redoing these cabinets

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,160
if this is gonna be a nursery
for a kid that you don't even have?

9
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,463
-[Kim] Yeah.
-Are you pregnant?

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,866
[tense music]

11
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,435
Is this a joke?

12
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,337
Do you not know we're having another baby?

13
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,438
Not really.

14
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,908
Scott, we're having a baby...

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,943
-in, like, a couple of months.
-[Scott] Are you being serious?

16
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,912
-I'm dead serious.
-[Scott] Oh, okay.

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,847
[Kim] No, I swear.

18
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,315
But you're not carrying it?

19
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,784
No, I'm not.

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,519
-[Scott] What?
-We went the surrogacy route.

21
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,821
-I never had this conversation with you?
-[Scott] This is a joke.

22
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,523
-I swear I'm not joking with you.
-[Scott] Yeah, right.

23
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,491
Scott, I swear I'm not joking with you.

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,293
I don't know what's going on anymore.

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,362
[theme music]

26
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:23,983
{\an8}[Kris] Hi.

27
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,452
{\an8}Is Kylie still living here?

28
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,320
{\an8}[Kris] Yup, Kylie's living here.

29
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,255
{\an8}That's what happens around here.

30
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,525
{\an8}I'd like to move in here at some point
and not have to pay bills.

31
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,861
-[Kris] Well...
-[Scott] Do you mind?

32
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,262
[Kris] Everybody else does.

33
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,597
[Scott] It's very hip.

34
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,533
So, when are you going to Fashion Week?

35
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,669
[Kris] Next week.

36
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,637
I kind of feel like I want to go with you.

37
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,606
-To Fashion Week?
-[Scott] Yeah.

38
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,108
And, like, do stuff together.

39
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,343
Go to lunch, dinner.
I'll go to some shows with you.

40
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,080
Well, didn't you tell me that you were...
you'd been invited to some shows

41
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,516
-and they were gonna pay you to go?
-Yeah. Yeah, but I wasn't gonna go.

42
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,152
I was just gonna stay home
and hang with, like, the kids and relax,

43
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,888
but I then I was like, I kind of, like,
wanna spend some time with you

44
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,957
and, like... I just feel like
I never see you at home.

45
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,525
And I feel like this is, like,
a good time for me

46
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,826
to spend, like, with, like, family

47
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,995
and not be, like, alone and stuff,
so it's good.

48
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,264
Well, I would love to have you come.

49
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,635
Fashion Week in New York is always fun
and because I'm from New York,

50
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,838
I love to get back there,
and this is a perfect excuse to go back

51
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,940
and it's always nice
to see all my old friends.

52
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,209
And now that Kris is going,
it's even more exciting

53
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,411
'cause I get to spend some time with her
in my hometown.

54
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,314
We'll go to Carbone,

55
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,284
or we'll go to Cipriani,

56
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,887
or we'll go to Serafina.

57
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,022
Oh, my God, Milos, my favorite.

58
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,057
-[Scott] You love that place, huh?
-I do.

59
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,059
[Kris] And then Kendall's receiving
an award.

60
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,127
She is?

61
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:46,399
The <i>Daily Front Row</i> is giving her
the Fashion Icon of the Decade.

62
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,801
Oh, how cute. Well, I would go to that
and, like, support her for that.

63
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,270
[Kris] So that's an award show.

64
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,539
-[Scott] I like where this is going.
-[Kris] Yeah, me too.

65
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:56,042
So you're gonna bring out the wardrobe,
right, for Fashion Week?

66
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,545
-You gonna wear suits with a pocket scarf.
-[Scott] Yeah.

67
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,847
-Scott Disick.
-[Scott] For sure.

68
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,549
You're gonna be Scott Disick on this trip?

69
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,450
[Scott] I'm gonna be Scott Disick
in this bitch.

70
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,885
[chuckles]
I love it.

71
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,854
I may wear a suit on the plane.
[laughs]

72
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,689
-[Scott] Okay. See you.
-[Kris] Well, don't get carried away.

73
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,424
-[Scott] Love you.
-Love you too.

74
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,193
[soft chuckle]

75
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,696
[in high-pitched filtered voice]
Can I flick your ponytail, Kourt?

76
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,898
[indistinct chatter]

77
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,501
[upbeat music]

78
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,772
-[server] Hi, there.
-[Khloé] Hi, how are you?

79
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,107
-[server] Welcome.
-Thank you.

80
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,913
-Thank you.
-[Khloé] What do you get?

81
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,383
-[Kim] I get the Dim Sum and Then Some.
-What the [bleep] is that?

82
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,284
It's three things.

83
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,555
So, I get the chicken pot stickers
with the...

84
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,825
then a little salad
and then shrimp-fried rice.

85
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,160
[Khloé] That's your whole thing?

86
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,995
-But it's literally enough for both of us.
-[waitress] How you doing?

87
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,531
-[Khloé] Thank you.
-Good. How are you?

88
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,899
-Don't know why I said thank you.
-Can I get y'all started

89
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,934
with any mango iced tea, lemonade?

90
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,970
-I'll have a mango iced tea, please.
-Mango, sure.

91
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,771
-I'll do an Arnold Palmer.
-Sure.

92
00:03:58,838 --> 00:03:59,839
Thank you.

93
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,241
Do you care for any sweetener on the side?

94
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,742
-Yes, please.
-I'll be right back.

95
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:03,710
Thanks.

96
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,250
Yesterday, went into a doctor's office,
they walk me in the front door.

97
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,852
Thirty people in the waiting room
and I'm like,

98
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,888
"Uh," and then the surrogate,
like, runs up to me

99
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,357
and the guy's videotaping.

100
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,659
-And I... Some random.
-[Khloé] Who?

101
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,029
And I'm like, okay,
like, if this isn't that obvious,

102
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,866
it was just such a [bleep] show yesterday
and then it's, like, everywhere.

103
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:33,239
My doctor was sick and they recommended
my surrogate go for a check-up

104
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:37,310
at a random doctor's office,
so I went to that appointment.

105
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,580
And all of these people were in the lobby
and people were trying to take pictures.

106
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,149
So, right away,
I started to get all of these calls

107
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,984
and emails asking if it was true.

108
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,253
I really hope the speculation dies down

109
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,722
and people just don't dig more
to try to get more info.

110
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,792
So, anyway, I come home.

111
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:57,730
I'm showing North pictures and she's like,
"Mom, is this baby in your belly?"

112
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,333
-Like, I don't even know what's happening.
-[Kim] "Where is the baby, Mom?"

113
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,535
[Khloé] It is gonna be weirder
having another baby.

114
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,404
But you know what I say to people

115
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,839
that are nervous
when they're having their third?

116
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:07,974
[Khloé] Mm?

117
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,510
[Kim] What would we do without our Khloé?

118
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,779
-Aw.
-[Kim] That is my line.

119
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,582
I almost wanted to put you on speaker
with someone and say it on the fly.

120
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,918
We'll call good old Allison.

121
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,952
[line ringing]

122
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,587
Good old Allison.

123
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,390
{\an8}-[Allison] <i>Hello?</i>
-[Kim] Hey.

124
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,261
{\an8}-<i>Hi.</i>
-Real quick, what do I say...

125
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,864
What did I say to you when you were
really nervous about having your third?

126
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,934
<i>"Khloé's the best.
What would we do without Khloé?"</i>

127
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,502
Aw, I am here.

128
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,705
I wanted to see
if she was telling the truth or not.

129
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,273
<i>Aw, does she lie a lot?</i>

130
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,974
-Yeah, but Kim...
-[laughing]

131
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,277
-...that's so good to know.
-[Kim] No, I don't.

132
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,182
{\an8}-[Allison] You're so cute.
-Hey!

133
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,487
{\an8}[birds chirping]

134
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,755
[Kris] Hey, Khloé.

135
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,124
-Hey, Mom. Oh, you look pretty.
-Do you have an appointment?

136
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,792
-Thank you.
-Yeah, you're like the doctor.

137
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,960
I sit here and I wait.

138
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,696
-[Kris] Oh, exactly.
-Like a waiting room.

139
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,366
-What are you doing?
-[Khloé] I'm just glancing.

140
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,267
-What are you doing?
-[Kris] Uh...

141
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,802
[phone ringing]

142
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,237
You know what? It's Kim.

143
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,072
Hey.

144
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,541
{\an8}[Kim] <i>Hey. So I wanted to call you and see</i>

145
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,511
<i>if, um, my stylist can come on the plane,</i>

146
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,947
<i>if there's enough room
since it's Fashion Week.</i>

147
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,649
You know, Scott wants
to come on the plane too.

148
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,817
<i>Scott's going?</i>

149
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,920
[Kris] Yeah. And he's trying to be sober,

150
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,922
but here's the thing, I was just talking...

151
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,691
<i>Wait, do you think it's really bizarre</i>

152
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,627
<i>that he is going to Fashion Week,</i>

153
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,262
<i>like, to party and, like...</i>

154
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,165
I don't know if he's going to party.
Hi. Khlo's here.

155
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,468
-<i>Hey.</i>
-I don't know if he's going to party.

156
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,138
I think he just wants to, like, go
and feel good.

157
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,940
I just think there's enough, you know...

158
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,711
history, bad history here,

159
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:56,449
to, um, pay a little bit of attention,
give him something to do

160
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,652
so he doesn't have an excuse to go
get into some trouble.

161
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,355
<i>So we're gonna babysit, basically.</i>

162
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,323
But remember when he disappeared?

163
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,325
Like, he just literally disappeared.

164
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,928
Didn't show up for anything,
nobody could find him.

165
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,165
I think we just have to remember
every time there's a dinner or a show

166
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:16,035
or you know, a lunch or something,
to bring him along.

167
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,104
[tense music]

168
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,107
New York has always been
such a temptation for Scott

169
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:27,447
and very, very much
his very dangerous playground.

170
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:31,150
So I want to plan some really fun things
for Scott and I to do together.

171
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,687
[Kris] So, can you come over here later on
for a meeting?

172
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,790
[Kim] <i>Well, I can't
because I'm dying my hair blonde</i>

173
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,026
<i>and it's gonna take forever, so...</i>

174
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,195
[Kris] You're dying your hair blonde?

175
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,530
Wait, have you ever heard
of this thing called a wig?

176
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,700
<i>I don't like wigs.
They're just not for me.</i>

177
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,336
<i>Like, I need my real hair.</i>

178
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,239
[Kris] This is a huge commitment.

179
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,076

After 12 hours of dying it.

-Blondie.
-[Kim] Do you guys like it?

186
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,732
-Wowzas. Holy...
-[Kim] You don't like it.

187
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,635
No, I do, it's just, like,
you change things all the time.

188
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,736
-I'm not that blown away.
-[Kim] No, I don't.

189
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,304
I've had the same hair forever.

190
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,874
-[Khloé] You had white hair...
-[Kim] Three years ago.

191
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,008
-Okay.
-[Kim] Three.

192
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,910
And it was yellow, not this white.

193
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,013
What are you guys doing out here
on the basketball court

194
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,715
-drinking tea?
-We were gonna organize all these car...

195
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,817
-'Cause look at all the crap she has here.
-Yeah.

196
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,485
-This is disgusting.
-And they're filthy.

197
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,121
You need, like, car covers
or something with this crap.

198
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,857
-No, who wants to come and uncover it?
-Or, like, what are those?

199
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,293
But your kids are taller
than those soccer things.

200
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,897
-[Khloé] God, this is the one thing I am...
-Those are hockey.

201
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,699
-...not looking forward to. Oh.
-Those are hockey.

202
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,268
-[Kourtney] They like this.
-[Khloé] Okay.

203
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,069
They love these scooters.

204
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,404
They like their bikes.

205
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,172
They like the skateboards.

206
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:03,576
[Kourtney] Well, um, okay,
which of these cars can go?

207
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,248
Okay, this is fine.

-[Khloé] Don't you feel good?

00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,629
[Kourtney] What about this one?

214
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,399
[Kim] Yeah, I think that's a good one.

00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,967
-[Khloé] That's cute.
-[Kourtney] Okay.

00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,171

I feel good about that.

Holy [bleep], you guys.

I've never seen tarantulas before
in the years of living here.

this is happening.

is fully doing, like, a prank on me.

Like, this is my biggest nightmare.
I've got to get out of here.

244

[Kim] No one [bleep] with me
and try to put one on me,

245
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,141
or I'll literally [bleep] kill you.

-Top of the morning to you!

-Hey.

I haven't had Cipriani's
in about ten hours.

-Oh, my God. Mwah.
-Hi.

-Hi.
-[Kim] I just had breakfast.

256
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,310
So I'm gonna save mine until later.

-[Kris] I'm so excited.
-[Scott] What are you guys up to?

258
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,915

259
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,819
Tonight, I'm gonna go
to this Vivienne Westwood exhibit.

-Yeah.

to mingle with people.

265
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,367
It's our first full day in New York.

266
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,137
I can't force him to go to the things
that I'm going to

267
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,206
and that I have to go to for work.

268
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,575
But at the same time,
it's gonna stress me out

269
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,377
because I don't know
what he's gonna be doing.

Oh, I was like, I didn't know.

279
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,263
I know, I said everyone's gonna think
it's, like, a wig, but it's not.

280
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,232
-Did you do it for something?
-For this.

281
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,835
-Oh, for this. Okay!
-[Kim] Yeah, just for New York.

282

-For your show. No pressure.
-Oh, well...

of inspiration from you in the show too.

-Yay.

It's gonna be, like, you know.

00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,448
Yes. I'm so excited.

289
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:34,820

the resort piece that we made for you.

290
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,123
-[Kim] How cute.
-[Alexander] It's, like, off the shoulder.

-KJ will steal this.
-[Alexander laughs]

292
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,729
I don't know what it is about September
and this plaid, but I'm obsessed.

293
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,598
This is really cute.

294
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,800
Love this. It's so cool.

295
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,336

-So that's really cute.

and you've done New York.

[Larsa] Thank you.

302
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,532
[Kourtney] Oh, wait, you got gold nails?

303
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,567
[Larsa] Is it good,
or is it too, like, stripperish?

304
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,369
-It's kind of stripperish.
-No, but it's fun.

305
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,470
[Larsa] I liked it there

306
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,839
and then as soon as I left, I go,
"What was I thinking?"

307
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,376
No, I just, I mean, you're talking
to the wrong person, 'cause I do "nude."

308
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,945
I know, normally,
all I do is, like, white or black.

309
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,848
But lately, I've... You know,
I moved to LA, it's like a new vibe.

310
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,684
You were like, "Let me stripper it up."

311
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,687
[Larsa] Let me just turn up
for a hot moment.

312
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,588
[Larsa screams]

313
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,622
-Oh, my God!
-Oh! What?

314
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,659
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-[Larsa] What?

315
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,594
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

316
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,929
[laughter]

317
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,730
I called pest control.

318
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,099
They came. They sprayed two times.

319
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,771
I just don't even know what to do,
because this is where,

320
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,841
I swear, we're outside,
like, 50 percent of the time.

321
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,710
And I've already had the exterminator
come out and spray.

322
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,081
Yes, the guy's here spraying
for tarantulas.

323
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,617
[Kourtney] Oh, my God!

324
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,686
[upbeat music]

325
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,990
I just won't be able to sleep at night,
and I just...

326
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:22,061
I will not feel comfortable
until these tarantulas are fully gone.

327
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,864

00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,880
-[Scott] Yeah.
-[Kris] Okay.

493
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,882
-[Scott] All right, let's shop.
-Yeah.

494
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:57,816
That's cute.

495
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,485
Anybody need a bride... bridal gown?

496
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,188
No, I would buy the mannequins, I swear.

497
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:07,326
You are my favorite lunch date
because you don't talk.

498
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,760
Scott, do you like this table?

499
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,362
I think I'm gonna buy this table.

500
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,797
[Kris] Look at this outfit.

501
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,098
Look at that belt.

502
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,499
Wait, look at those shoes.

503
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,069
I have a shopping problem.
[chuckles]

504
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,838
[Scott] Should I buy it for her?

505
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,808
-This bag? Céline? Painted on?
-Oh.

506
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,943
Where'd that go, that Céline bag?

507
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,211
[salesman] This one? You want this?

508
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,579
[Scott] Sure, I'll buy that.

509
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,781
[security] So do you want me to take it,
or just ship it to your house?

510
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,083
[Scott] No, take it.

511
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,585
-Ship the... Ship the kids' stuff.
-[security] Mm-hmm.

512
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,653
[Scott] Take the bag.

513
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,554
[security] Okay.

514
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,892
Keeping an eye on Scott
is turning out to be a full-time job.

515
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,429
I don't think it's any secret
that Scott's been dating,

516
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,165
but he drops little hints here and there

517
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,869
that makes me think that it might be
a little more serious than I thought.

518
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,841
-Do you like it? Do you like this?
-[Scott] That's [bleep] fire.

519
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,976
-Really?
-I'd wear the [bleep] out of that thing.

520
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,745
-[Kris] Are you serious?
-Swear.

521
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:00,746
[Scott] I love robes.

522
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,414
I would wear that myself.

523
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,583
[upbeat music]

524
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:14,292
{\an8}Gabbana, you got to stop hitting me
with your chin. It's rude.

525
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,530
[Kourtney] Hey, Khlo.

526
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,634
-[Khloé] Hey! I camo'd it up.
-Camo and camo.

527
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,936
-You're still working on this puzzle?
-Where are you guys...

528
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,273
Yes, it's gonna, trust me,
this will be probably the death of me.

529
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,908
[Mason] Can I have Lucky Charms?

530
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,010
[Reign] Want Lucky Charms.

531
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,146
{\an8}-No.
-[Mason] Me too. Oh, man.

532
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,648
No, I ordered you guys Sugarfish.

533
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:37,582
Okay.

534
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:38,650
Oh!

535
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,521
I... am serious. I'm serious.

536
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,755
Please, Mom!

537
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,658
-I actually...
-No, I am super serious.

538
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,126
-Please, Mom.
-[Penelope] You never...

539
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,495
You guys, why do you have
all the suitcases here?

540
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,664
Because we're staying in the guesthouse

541
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,835
till I get this tarantula situation
under control.

542
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,304
-[Penelope] Come on, let's...
-That's...

543
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,505
[Kourtney] You know I have...

544
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,508
No, that's totally fine,
but you think, like, that...

545
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,178
[Kourtney] Oh! Come on! Go! Go, Diego.

546
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,847
You guys could totally stay here,
but you think by you staying here,

547
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,082
it's gonna resolve
your tarantula situation?

548
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,919
I have it. It's a work in process.

549
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,354
It's gonna take, like, three weeks.

550
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,356
-Three weeks!
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

551
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,892
And you guys are... All of you guys,

552
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,295
you four are gonna stay in the guesthouse?

553
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,596
Four of you.

554
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,798
-Do you know that a small...
-[Khloé] How will all...

555
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:31,036
Do you know that a small space
makes me extremely content?

556
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,838
All four of you are gonna fit in one bed?

557
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,306
[Kourtney] Yeah.

558
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,041
[Khloé] Thank God
you're all little people.

559
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,377
I hate tarantulas
as much as the next person,

560
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:42,380
but I wouldn't go and move in
with someone for a few weeks.

561
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,548
Like, that's crazy.

562
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,351
You guys really brought towels?

563
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:48,753
And a blanket.

564
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,356
How... how many towels did you guys bring?

565
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,860
Oh! Jeez.

566
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,562
Kourtney really is delusional.

567
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,698
I live less than a block away,

568
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,201
so if there's tarantulas on your property,
they probably are at mine too.

569
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,638
-What are you guys doing?
-[Penelope] Mom, look!

570
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,207
-[Khloé] What is happening over here?
-[Reign] Fridge!

571
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,575
{\an8}You know what? That's a sink.

572
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,611
It's not a fridge. It's a sink.

573
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,346
You know where the fridge is?

574
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,381
-[Kourtney] Hey, where's the fridge?
-[Mason] Yeah, Reign.

575
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,282
I told you.

576
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,284
-I told you!
-[Reign] Okay.

577
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,619
[kids babble]

578
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,953
[Khloé] Oh.

579
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:23,889
Oh, my gosh.

580
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,591
I only have a few more months left
of peace and quiet.

581
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,927
This is not what I need right now.

582
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,797
[speaking gibberish]

583
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,232
[Reign shouts]

584
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,535
[speaking gibberish]

585
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,103
[grunts]

586
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,805
Is this leather?

587
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,107
{\an8}That is leather.

588
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,343
[upbeat music]

589
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,317
{\an8}-[paparazzi] Ms. Kim...
-Ms. Kardashian, look this way.

590
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,351
[camera shutter clicking]

591
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,921
[Kim] I hope we make it on time.

592
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,690
Tomorrow is legs day.

593
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,825
I'm, like, dreading it.

594
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,194
-It's, like, legs with a big machine.
-[Appleton] The hell.

595
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,430
Then I have a day off. So I'm like...
[exhales]

596
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,366
I've gone so hard every day.

597
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,535
-[Appleton] It's good. It's working, boo.
-Yeah.

598
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,871
[line ringing]

599
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,272
[Kris] <i>Hi.</i>

600
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,207
{\an8}Hey. How was Fallon?

601
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,742
{\an8}<i>Oh, it was so good.</i>

602
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,144
<i>It was really good.</i>

603
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,112
-That's cute.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

604
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,317
<i>So I'm just on my way.
I'm almost to Scott's to pick him up,</i>

605
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,152
-<i>and they're right behind me.</i>
-Okay.

606
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,353
<i>So wait a second.</i>

607
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,090
<i>What is going on with Scott and Sofia?</i>

608
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,860
I've started to see pictures of Scott
running around New York,

609
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:40,398
and whatever makes him happy,
I don't judge, I don't care.

610
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,100
[Kim] It's... I think it's a good thing.

611
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,035
I just hope that he's making good choices

612
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,671
and having fun
and nothing's getting crazy.

613
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,708
[Kris] <i>Okay, let me text him and tell him
we're picking him up in five minutes</i>

614
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,376
<i>and I'll meet you at the venue in ten.</i>

615
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,346
Well, I don't wanna get there before you,
so let me know when you're there.

616
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,815
-<i>Okay, we'll be there in 15.</i>
-Okay, bye.

617
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,854
[upbeat music]

618
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,130
[Khloé] Do you need this? Or no?

619
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,598
I think.

620
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,134
-Then this goes on your lap.
-Nope, it doesn't.

621
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,236
{\an8}-It's your napkin. Yes, it does.
-Oh, yes.

622
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,774
You guys, who wants to do something fun?

623
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,342
[Mason and Penelope] I do!

624
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,244
I have something fun outside.

625
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,379
What?

626
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,448
-You want to go... Uh-huh.
-An activity?

627
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:33,885
Yeah! I told you there was an activity.

628
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,989
If Kourtney thinks her house
is full of horrors, then she's up

629
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,658
for a little surprise.

630
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,993
[Khloé] Whoo-whoo!

631
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,895
Isn't this awesome?

632
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,431
Okay, I'll show you how to do this.

633
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,099
[Mason] Okay, who wants this one?

634
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,403
-Aren't you guys having fun at KoKo's?
-For sure.

635
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,338
Wait. Oh, my gosh.

636
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,107
-[Khloé] What?
-I don't think you're supposed to do it...

637
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,176
-You're supposed to take off the wrapping...
-Oh, my gosh.

638
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,644
-...you freak.
-I got to redo it.

639
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,813
There's red plastic melted in here.

640
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,617
I'm not as expert of a s'more maker
as I once believed.

641
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,018
[Khloé] You just put chocolate
in the middle.

642
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,386
I know, but Reigny...

643
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,455
[Reign] Can you hear me, guys?

644
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,057
[all laugh]

645
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,024
[Khloé] Who you talking to?

646
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,260
[tense music]

647
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,696
Okay, come here, guys. Everyone sit here.

648
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,831
I'm gonna tell everyone a scary story.

649
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,366
[crickets chirping]

650
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,902
{\an8}[Khloé] In the village,
there was always a rumor

651
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:27,238
{\an8}that there was this human-eating spider

652
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,941
that was the size of a car.

653
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,410
Is it real, Mom?

654
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,413
-No more holding the stick. No.
-No, this is a... a pretend story.

655
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,883
What is that?

656
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,786
[Kourtney] Who is this dog,

657
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,155
and why is it dressed up in a fur coat?

658
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,957
{\an8}-Mom...
-[Khloé] It's a spider!

00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,448
Yeah, no, nothing. Running around.

828
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,750
[Kris] Yeah.

829
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,351
Are you dating?

830
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,753
-Sure.
-[Kris] Yeah.

831
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,189
Are you dating one person?

832
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,459
You know,
Kris really is like my mom to me,

833
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,529
so I don't ever feel like
she's really putting me on the spot,

834
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:42,533
but I don't really feel comfortable
talking to her

835
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,469
about my personal or dating life.

836
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,077
-Yeah.
-[Kris] Just one?

837
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,214
-Yeah. Something new.
-[Kris] Are you, like, going steady?

838
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,549
I guess that's what
the kids are calling it.

839
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,152
-Is it Sofia?
-[Scott] Huh?

840
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,121
Well, I mean, guess you know who it is.

841
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,156
[Kris] Yeah.

842
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,991
Wait, so how old is she?

843
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,560
'Cause I really don't know.
She Kylie's age? 20?

844
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,695
Nineteen.

845
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,464
[Kris] Oh, and you're 32.

846
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,765
Thirty-four.

847
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,367
-You're 34?
-[Scott] Yeah.

848
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,202
Okay, so, I was...

849
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,172
-[Scott] Fifteen.
-Seventeen.

850
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,908
[Kris and Scott] And Robert was...

851
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,276
[Kris] Well, 12 years older.

852
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,646
-[Scott] You were underage. She's not.
-Mm-hmm.

853
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,815
[Kris] Oh, touché.

854
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,417
-[hisses]
-So you guys were in the wrong,

855
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,518
-not me.
-[Kris] Yeah.

856
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,586
Hm.

857
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:40,324
Well, are you ever gonna come over
and, like, say hi,

858
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,694
or are we just gonna stay away from it
or what are we doing?

859
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,831
Am I ever gonna come over and say hi?

860
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,633
-No.
-Keep it there, keep it there.

861
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,302
That's bizarre.

862
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,605
I'm just trying to keep up with it.
You know what I mean?

863
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,508
[Scott] Are you, like, hanging out
with Kourtney's friend?

864
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,511
-[Kris] I barely met.
-Right, so why would I like?

865
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,015
[Kris] I don't know.

866
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,384
All right, well, will you keep me posted?

867
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,752
On what?

868
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,787
[Kris] I just want to know
what's going on with you.

869
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,722
I think it's a little weird if you've got...

870
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,493
significant change in life

871
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,095
and I haven't really heard
that much about it.

872
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:23,167
And I have to pull it out of you
like I'm fishing for salmon.

873
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,735
You ever fished for salmon?

874
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,939
For me, to see that Kris is invested
in my life means the world to me

875
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:33,978
because she's got so many other kids
and so much other things going on.

876
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,747
The fact that she actually worries,
loves, and cares about me

877
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,616
is probably
one of the best feelings I have.

878
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,152
And truthfully, as much as I'd like
to be honest with her

879
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,054
and tell her how I'm really feeling,

880
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,657
I also do want to respect Kourtney
and her feelings.

881
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,493
Maybe down the line,
but right now, you know,

882
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,496
my biggest thing
is just being respectful of everybody.

883
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:57,702
I just... I don't know, feel like
I'm always gonna be your mom.

884
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,570
{\an8}-[Scott] Agreed.
-So...

885
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,806
{\an8}-[Penelope] Agree.
-...you might as well just surrender.

886
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:02,707
[Penelope] Agree.

887
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,375
-[Scott] I did a long time ago.
-To the nonsense.

888
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,710
[laughs]

889
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,278
When I used to have to take the trash out...

890
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,280
-[laughs]
-...I surrendered then.

891
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,649
{\an8}[Khloé] <i>On the next episode...</i>

892
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,251
{\an8}-You self-centered bitch.
-What?

893
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,387
{\an8}Malika. Her and I have been feuding.

894
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:20,991
{\an8}For Khloé and Malika to not be speaking,
I know that it must be serious.

895
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,494
{\an8}-Turn it on.
-Stop. You did interviews?

896
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,863
{\an8}<i>Robert came over one day
when Cesar was out of town.</i>

897
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,999
{\an8}Oh, my God, you're such a whore.

898
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,369
{\an8}[phone rings]

899
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,269
{\an8}[Kris] Hi.

900
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,437
{\an8}[Kendall] <i>It's an emergency.</i>

901
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,673
{\an8}Do you want me to come
take you to the hospital?
