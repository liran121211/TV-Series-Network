00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:06,139
{\an8}<i>We're having the best time.</i>

00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:09,476
{\an8}<i>I threw up last night,
four times in my bed.</i>

00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,645
{\an8}You know, the last thing I want to do
is really hear exactly what Kourt's doing.

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,583
{\an8}Of course, in the back of my heart
and mind, I get a little jealous.

5
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,787
{\an8}I actually woke up to a text.

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,355
{\an8}I think there's a link of Scott.

7
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,124
{\an8}[Kourtney] He's just annoying.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,026
{\an8}[Khloé] He's not even trying.

9
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,595
{\an8}But what if something happens to him?

10
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,432
[upbeat music]

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,672
{\an8}[Khloé] I'm so tired of people.

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:40,907
She's 30 minutes late.

13

Get your [bleep] lives together.

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,244
So what's Kourtney's excuse?

15
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,480
Why don't you chime in
and say something to her?

16
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,882
-Why is it always me bullying her?
-[Kim] 'Cause I just didn't know.

17
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:49,849
I was upstairs working.

18
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,019
Well, well, well.

19
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,121
-It's so rude and unprofessional.
-[Kourtney] I'm not late.

20
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,290
-How are you not late?
-I mean, I... I said...

21
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,324
That's not what I meant.

22
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,426
What did you say?
[laughs]

23
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,560
What?

24
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,095
I don't know.

25
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,963
[Kourtney] I was getting a tea with Sarah.

26
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,398
[Khloé] That's why you're late?

27
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,167
-That's so [bleep] rude.
-The longest line.

28
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,234
Doesn't matter.

29
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,003
[Kourtney]
Well, I was actually very on time.

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,304
And I had time to kill,

31
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,274
and then the traffic
from getting to Beverly Hills...

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,010
So you don't have Waze
to see if you're running on...

33
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,812
-Never mind. Why do I even talk to you?
-[Kourtney] No, I didn't Waze before...

34
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,147
I don't even know why
I try to argue with you.

35
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,216
I think you're inconsiderate
of other people's time,

36
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,418
and that's one
of the biggest signs of disrespect

37
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,887
you could show anybody,
so thank you for your respect.

She keeps throwing [bleep] on your floor.

00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,498
That was a green sprinkle
that came from Kim's ice cream.

41
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,402
-Okay, go on. Vagina hit.
-Oh, my vagina.

00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:43,903
[Kourtney chuckles]

43
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,073
Should I be like Kim?

44
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,308
And hit you?

45
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,009
Don't be [bleep] rude!

46
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,978
-Are you kidding me?
-Oh, my God!

47
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,015
-You got shoes on, you asshole!
-I'll [bleep] hurt you. Don't...

48
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,751
It's my new bag Kim got me
for my birthday!

49
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,420
-[Kourtney] Oh, she did?
-[Khloé] Are you...

50
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,789
Do you guys think this is normal?

51
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,792
[Kourtney] Khloé, you're like
a rock-solid, hard...

00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,994

53
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,863
-[Kourtney] Bye.
-[Kim] Weirdos.

[theme music]

55
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,825
{\an8}-[Kris] Hi.
-[Faye] Hi, sweetheart.

56
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,527
{\an8}-[Kris] How are you?
-[Faye] I'm good.

57
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,562
-You were early, and I appreciate that.
-[Faye] I was early...

58
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,197
-And you were late for the first time...
-And I'm very proud of you.

59
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,166
{\an8}-...I think, in our entire relationship.
-[Kris] I am so...

60
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,101
{\an8}I think it's the first time in 40 years.

61
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,736
I'm so proud of you.

62
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:53,406
I walked out of a meeting,
and I said, "I have to go."

63
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,443
[Faye] Perfect. Thank you, Giuseppe.
Thank you.

64
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,445
[Kris] OJ's going up for parole again.

I know. Scares the death out of me.

66
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,450
[Faye] I've been having nightmares
about that.

67
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,919
[Kris] This is so good.

Do you want to taste this?

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,890
How do you go from that conversation
to "this is so good"?

70
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,826
-Because I'm in denial.
-[Faye] Obviously.

71
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,362
So do you have any time
to have dinner this week?

72
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,564
[fan 1] Sorry...

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,765
-Yes, I do.
-[fan 1] Sorry to bother you.

-Hi!
-Hi!

-Would you mind taking a picture with us?
-Hi! Sure.

-I'll take it. Of course.
-[fan 1] Thank you.

[Kris] What is this? Like an opal?

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,008
[fan 2] It's actually her grandmother.

-What?
-Her grandmother is in the ring.

-Yeah.

-Yeah. Yeah.
-Her grandmother is in the ring.

A picture of her grandmother?

No, it's actually her cremated ashes.

-But they actually...

But it's like a peach color.

-Can I see it?
-[Faye] I love it.

-Are you allowed to touch your grandma?
-Right?

-They, um... Oh!

-Your grandmother is beautiful.

This is starting
to creep me out a little bit.

Here's your ring.

00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,212
-[fan 2] Seriously.
-[Faye] Really?

-[fan 1] No, really.
-[Kris] I thought she was kidding.

That's her grandmother! Okay.

00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,517
Oh, no. Sorry. Awkward.

-Oh, my God. Fantastic.
-[Kris] Oh.

-[Faye] So cool. Nice meeting you.
-[fan 1] Bye.

-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you so much.

I love that.

00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,629
That's her grandmother.

109
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,402
I think that the one thing that most
families aren't prepared for is death.

110
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:33,706
Although I've investigated
a lot of options before,

111
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,441
it's always been pushed to the side.

112
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,677
I would like to do the mausoleum.

113
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:41,314
This could be Khloé's section,
and she could go all the way up...

114

-[Khloé] Mom, be careful.
-Just go slow. Just go slow.

115
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,250
-[Rob] Slow.
-[Kim] Don't slip and die.

116
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,685
You might actually need this thing.

117
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,421
I've heard of people that go to lunch

118
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,457
with, like, an urn
with their grandfather's ashes,

119
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,961
just to be close to them,
so I'm not judging.

120
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,864
I would much rather not be...

121
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,034
-stuck in a hole in the ground.
-[Faye] Right?

122
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,503
Oh, my God. I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

123
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,804

00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,066
Hanging out with Scott
is usually really fun.

169
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,502
And I'm always in a good mood
when I'm with Scott.

170
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,972
But today, he seems a little
on the feisty side.

171
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,307
[Kris] This is a cute little glass.

172
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,842
[Scott] So let's do eight of those.

173
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,811
-So eight of these?
-[Scott] Yeah.

174
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,646
There you go. This is exciting.

175
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,249
-[laughs]
-Shut the [bleep] up.

176
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,651
[Kris] I don't know what
his deal is right now.

177
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,019
Take a little nap out here.

178
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,622
[Kris] I'm not gonna call him out
in front of the whole store,

179
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,191
but the behavior's a little weird.

180
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,462
-Some of these robes look nice.
-Yeah, they do.

181
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,963
I got to start wearing robes more.

182
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,698
-You know, the robe...
-It's very Hugh Hefner.

183
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,599
Oh, my God.

184
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,436
[Scott] If I'm gonna be here all day,
I'm gonna start relaxing.

185
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,403
Ah!

186
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,876
[upbeat music]

187
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,783
{\an8}How funny did Kylie used to be?
Did you see that video?

188
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,519
-[Khloé] Which one? No, I never got...
-That I sent a group text...

189
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,254
It was so funny.

190
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,956
-Like, I sent it, like...
-If you're talking, get out of here.

191
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,425
[Kourtney] I actually said that.
All right. I'm getting off the phone.

192
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,560
You look cute.

193
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,861
[Khloé] You look very cute.

194
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,429
-You look really cute.
-Thank you. Okay. Bye.

195
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,232
[Kourtney] Did you tell Khloé
about our Miami trip?

196
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,403
-Well, I just wrote on the group text.
-We're gonna go to the opening of LIV...

197
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,338
Well, I just said, "Do you guys wanna go?"

198
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,841
So should we do a Miami trip
for the opening...

199
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,577
-Yes.
-...just for, like, legit, two nights?

200
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,512
[Kourtney] And bring the kids
and go to the beach and stuff?

201
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,848
-Oh, no. The kids?
-[Kim] No.

202
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,283
Do you guys want to know
some exciting news?

203
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,218
What?

204
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,021
I figured out my passion in life.

205
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,857
[Kim] Let me guess. Being a model?

206
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:16,195
Yes. I'm the new five-foot-one,
38-year-old supermodel.

207
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,232
Um... No, Simon...

208
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,635
I feel like Simon is just good to,
like, bounce ideas off of,

209
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:27,974
and he's like, "You have to just
take rein of, like, the interior stuff,

210
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,511
and that's, like, your passion,
so produce a show,

211
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,447
like a some kind of, like, interior show..."

212
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,082
-What?
-This already sounds like

213
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,251
-too much of a commitment for you.
-[Kourtney] Why?

214
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,952
[Khloé] You don't like things
with big commitments.

215
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,854
Okay. So are you here to kill my vibe?

216
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,825
I think we're just a little bit frustrated
that you never, like, show up to do work.

217
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,530
{\an8}[tense music]

218
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,098
{\an8}[Kourtney]
So are you here to kill my vibe,

219
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,366
{\an8}-or are you here to...
-[Khloé] I'm being realistic.

220
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,700
You never are realistic.

221
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,002
Work is still work.

222
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,370
What kind of show do you wanna produce?

223
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,938
I'm not telling you anymore.

224
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,940
-Interior design?
-You lost your opportunity.

225
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,010
-Why? 'Cause I was being honest?
-[Kourtney] No, but it wasn't even...

226
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,379
-It wasn't only that.
-I was just letting you know.

227
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,681
I think you have to be
a little more involved

228
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,049
than just slapping your name on something.

229
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,986
It's not just like, "Oh, hey,
I'm a Kardashian, so... interior design.

230
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,222
No one's doing that." It, like, has to be...

231
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,025
But what if you came up
with your own line?

232
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,226
-[Kourtney] I am.
-Oh.

233
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,761
[Kourtney] That's what I was trying
to tell you.

234
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,896
I could do a cool coffee table book.

235
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,566
I could do tons of, like, home stuff.

236
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,936
-I just need to, like, actually, do it.
-[Khloé] Do it.

237
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,172
Like, talking about it is great,
and that's right up your alley.

238
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,143
It's so natural for you, but, like...
So what's your next step?

239
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,946
-Let's actually proceed.
-I don't know.

240
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,448
I love Kourtney and I want to support her,

241
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,784
but I've definitely heard
this song and dance before.

242
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,186
We were in the talks
for doing a fitness line

243
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,754
and I put everything on hold.

244
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,424
It doesn't really seem like
this train is moving

245
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,659
-at the speed I want it to move...
-[Kourtney] Guess what?

246
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,729
I'm not the fastest-moving person.

247
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,732
She has this pattern of coming up
with these great ideas,

248
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,801
but then she doesn't follow through
with any of them.

249
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,003
She can't even show up
to a meeting on time.

250
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,372
It... it has to be, like...

251
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,274
You have to live it, breathe it.

252
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,142
[Kim] People have to, like,
feel it in your soul.

253
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,277
It is in my soul.

254
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,013
[tense music]

255
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,183
[North] Her real name is Diamond.

256
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,151
[Kim laughs]
It is?

257
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,454
[upbeat music]

258
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,323
{\an8}[Khloé] Mom, are you working out
at 7:00 a.m.?

259
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,058
I could do 6:30 to 7:30.

260
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,328
It's up to... I mean, that's fine.
You don't have to.

261
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,596
So, I don't know.

262
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,164
I went shopping with Scott.

263
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,000
-Mm-hmm.
-We went to Williams-Sonoma,

264
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,268
and he just seemed a little bit off.

265
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,504
I'm just... I'm worried about him. I'm...

266
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,941
I'm sincerely worried
about his well-being.

267
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:46,946
But I guarantee you 10,000 percent
that you didn't say one word.

268
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,715
I kind of wonder is it me?
Is it my imagination?

269
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,618
No. Obviously not.
So [bleep] say something.

270
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,957
I think he really wants to be invited
to all the things that we do

271
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,158
and keep his...

272
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,361
-you know... In the fam.
-Spot.

273
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,064
[Kourtney] He's always gonna be
part of the family.

274
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,732
That's not the issue, but...

275
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,602
-[Kris] I know. I still think he...
-Say something, then, though. Call him.

276
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,571
Say, "Hey, is everything okay
when we went to Williams Sonoma?

277
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,606
You seemed a little off."

278
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,308
I'm so sick of people, like,
not saying anything, though.

279
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:22,181
I am just over everybody feeling
the need to report to me, you know,

280
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,583
about every little detail going on
with Scott.

281
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,521
The situation is extremely hard
and complicated,

282
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:34,393
but I do have my own priorities
and things that I need to focus on.

283
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,831
He's just not, like,
my biggest concern anymore.

284
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,702
Maybe he was just sad
because we were supposed to hang out.

285
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,138
The kids and Scott,
but the kids ended up going to the fair.

286
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,308
-[Khloé] Stop making excuses for him.
-You guys could have gone to the fair.

287
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,777
Both of you,
instead of going to Williams Sonoma.

288
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,380
-Get your [bleep] sneakers on...
-[Kris] I went to the fair...

289
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,315
-...and go to the fair!
-...for 40 years!

290
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,283
I went to a fair.

291
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,485
I took all of you guys
to the Del Mar fair.

292
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,655
-[Khloé] That was MJ.
-My grandparents took me to the fair.

293
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,890
-You never took us to the fair.
-I took you to the fair.

294
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:05,858
You've never taken us.

295
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,661
We would go to the UCLA fair.

296
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,662
-Kim and I...
-[Kris] I've taken...

297
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,432
I used to take you to the Malibu carnival
when you were little.

298
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,201
-[Kourtney] You never took us...
-[Kim] The chili cook-off?

299
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,103
-...to the chili cook-off.
-Oh, that was Kendall and Kylie. Sorry.

300
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,005
-Okay.
-[Kim] Yeah.

301
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,542
Get on some sneakers
and take your grandkids to the fair.

302
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,813
[upbeat music]

303
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,229

305
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,834
-Hey.
-[Kim] Hey.

306
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,935
What's that?

307
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,670
How cool is this?

308
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,874
This is the case that I ordered

309
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,308
because I wanted to see it

310
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,311
of the, um, the diamond.

311
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,579
What diamond?

312
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,314
[Kris] I thought I told you.

313
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,383
The diamond that I would make

314
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,788
or you would make out my... cremations.

315
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,292
So, when I pass away,

316
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,463
I would be cremated,
and then you would take my remains

317
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,698
-and have a diamond made.
-And turn it into a diamond?

318
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:20,699
[Kris] Yeah.

319
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:26,071
I believe in God and I believe
that I'm definitely going to heaven,

320
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,873
so let's just get that straight right now.

321
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,646
But it's my responsibility
to make some plans for the future

322
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,948
so that my kids don't have to worry
about it.

323
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,952
Listen. It's a very stressful time
when someone passes away,

324
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,855
so I thought I would take this
off of your plate

325
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,857
because you're always the one in charge

326
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,993
and show you how we could do it.

327
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,429
[Kris] Okay, so these little lights...

328
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,430
Oh, that's so cute.

329
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,365
So I guess it just sits right here.

00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,857
But what do you think, I just go on these...

492
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,225
-No, I thought...
-...elaborate trips?

493
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,793
I thought it was a guy you're dating.

494
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,363
Why would we assume something
unless we hear it from you?

495
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,765
-You can't just assume people know.
-Mm-hmm.

496
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,235
Kourtney definitely does things
in her own time

497
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,505
whenever she feels comfortable,
but I am proud of Kourtney

498
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,708
for finally opening up to Scott
about her current relationship status.

499
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,979
I'm just happy that there's, like,
motion moving forward for her.

500
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,149
What can I do
to get rid of varicose veins?

501
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,551
I don't know. Where do you have them?

502
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,354
Here.

503
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,157
[Kourtney] You have to ask.

504
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,359
Like, I think you can laser them.

505
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,595
Yeah. Mom said I inject them with saline.

506
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,397
That sounds hurtful.

507
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,333
She goes, "It's so painful."
With a smile on her face.

508
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,801
I was like...
[scoffs]

509
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,036
"Okay."

510
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,404
Weirdo.

511
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,173
[upbeat music]

512
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,882
{\an8}[line ringing]

513
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,584
[Dean] <i>Hello. LifeGem. This is Dean.</i>

514
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,988
{\an8}Hey, Dean.
I'm just, actually, on your website,

515
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:07,459
looking what you have going on here,
and it's kind of fascinating.

516
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:11,496
Can you walk me through,
just quickly, you know, in general,

517
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,334
what the process is
once someone passes away?

518
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,339
<i>Typically, when someone calls us,
we actually send out a kit</i>

519
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:24,209
<i>that, uh, holds the amount of remains
that we use for the process.</i>

520
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:28,747
<i>So we heat those remains up
to about 3,000 degrees centigrade.</i>

521
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:31,850
<i>Basically, what that does
is it leaves us with the pure carbon,</i>

522
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,020
<i>and then that goes into
one of our diamond presses.</i>

523
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:39,591
But if I wanted to do, like, a diamond,
and I needed six diamonds,

524
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,861
I could probably get six diamonds
out of one body.

525
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,163
<i>Oh, yeah, yep.
That would not be a problem.</i>

526
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,431
[Kris] Interesting.

527
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,934
Dean, this has been so helpful.

528
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,036
I really appreciate you
getting on the phone with me.

529
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,772
[Kris] I'm gonna have
a little chat with my kids.

530
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,309
Uh, we'll contact you and tell you
kind of like what we're gonna do.

531
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,111
-<i>All right. You're very welcome, Kris.</i>
-[Kris] Okay.

532
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,078
<i>Thank you for calling.</i>

533
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,680
All right. You got it. Bye-bye.

534
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,615
<i>Okay. Yep. Bye-bye.</i>

[phone thuds]

536
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,719
Maybe you should gain some weight
right before you die...

537
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,123
and then we can make more.

538
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,292
Well, he just said...

539
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,828
-[Kim] Is it like a nice quality diamond?
-Look at it!

540
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,631
Each and every LifeGem diamond
"is certified for authenticity..."

541
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,632
Oh, my God!

542
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,769
I could turn your body
into that Asscher cut diamond.

543
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:24,703
[Kris laughs]
Yes.

544
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,338
-Come with me.
-[laughing]

545
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,573
Well, you got to wait till I die first.

546
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,078
And what if they make
and take your remains

547
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,414
and get them mixed up with other remains?

548
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,948
That is so weird.

549
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,517
[Kris] Or lose you in the mail?

550
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,354
All this information is like a buzzkill.

551
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,591
I just, I can't wrap my head around
all the technical stuff

552
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,995
and what it really means,
and I appreciate it, for sure.

553
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,298
[Kris] There are just so many options
with this death diamond process

554
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,035
that I don't know what to do
because I have so many kids.

555
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,070
And it's just getting ridiculous.

556
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,205
I just don't get it.

557
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,442
I don't get how you can turn
a body into a diamond.

558
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:07,512
People would be killing people
and taking their bodies

559
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,782
and making it into diamonds
and selling it.

560
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:16,588
You should start this business
because you're very entrepreneurial.

561
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,791
I'm gonna steal all your [bleep]
and see what I can turn into a diamond.

00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,170
[Malika] I'm such a lost cause.

[Khloé] No, you're not.

568
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,774
You really just pick the wrong people.

569
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:36,908
I think so.

570
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,477
I think we all have our [bleep].

571
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,778
But you are pretty.

572
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,080
Like, you're a good catch,
so it's not like...

573
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,381
Look, all I'm gonna tell you is

574
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:47,352
I might show up one day
with a partner named Monique.

575
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,987
-No, you won't.
-[laughs]

576
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,058
I mean, if you like that sort of thing,
you might, but...

577
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,794
[Malika] I don't even know what to do
with one more vagina,

578
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,362
to be very honest with you.

579
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,296
[phone chimes]

580
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,502
[Khloé] Hold on.
Scott's having another episode.

581
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,739
It's always something in this family.

582
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,241
[line ringing]

583
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,176
{\an8}-People actually announce that?
-[Kourtney] <i>Hey.</i>

584
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,445
{\an8}So, you told him you have a boyfriend.

585
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,513
Now he's doing this

586
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,682
because he knows every time he does that,
you come over there running.

587
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,887
[Kourtney] <i>I'm here.
I'm just in the driveway.</i>

588
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,421
So you're there?

589
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,657
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

590
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,193
-You did exactly what he wanted.
-What he wants.

591
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,229
<i>I don't know.
I was like, "What are you [bleep] on?"</i>

592
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,797
<i>And he's like, "Everything."</i>

593
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,867
You know he's just doing this
for attention right now.

594
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,238
I just think you're doing
exactly what he wants.

595
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,241
Of course, you have to do whatever
that makes you feel better,

596
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,175
-but...
-<i>Yeah.</i>

597
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,344
He's just doing this
for attention right now.

598
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,314
<i>I'll see the vibe, I guess, when I get in.</i>

599
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,983
-<i>I'll call you back. Bye.</i>
-Bye.

600
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,219
Oh, oh, oh.

601
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,989
He does this all the time.

602
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,392
-And I'm sorry for sounding cold.
-I feel bad for her to keep

603
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,694
having to deal with this.
Well, I mean, I don't...

604
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,930
I think what you're doing
is you're speaking the facts.

605
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:08,867
Do you feel bad about his state of mind
and where he is? Of course, you do.

606
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,636
But for what he's putting
Kourtney through, no.

607
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:15,473
That's not something you think is cool,
so you're not gonna put sugar on [bleep].

608
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,712
[upbeat music]

609
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,287
[Kim] Kourt?

610
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:35,093
[Khloé] It says it's a superfood,
but now I'm confused.

611
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,529
It has carbs 'cause of sugar, right?

612
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,364
Everything in moderation.

613
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,833
Remember?

614
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,368
Remember that rule?

615
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,640
[Khloé] First of all, Kourtney's been
on savage mode.

616
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,042
-Yeah, I've been on savage [bleep] mode.
-[Khloé] Intense.

617
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,577
Today was epic.

618
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,913
[Kourtney] I just, honestly,
don't have the energy.

619
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,815
[Khloé] I know. 'Cause it's repetitive.

620
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:57,849
[Kourtney] Um...

621
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,119
So, yeah, I went to Scott's house
'cause he called me

622
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,354
and was really out of it.

623
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,356
He was just very aggressive.

624
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,691
[somber music]

625
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,793
And then I was like, "I'm leaving."

626
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,964
And I just started crying, and I was like,
"I do not need to even be here."

627
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,800
And then I was like,
"Just, like, sit down!"

628
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,637
Like, literally, you have
to talk to him like...

629
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,206
Like crazy. Otherwise, he won't listen.

630
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,111
So I'm like,
"Sit down across the room from me.

631
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,246
Like, what the [bleep] is wrong with you?

632
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,048
When is it gonna be enough?

633
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,983
I have three kids to take care of."

634
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,018
Yeah.

635
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,552
-[Kourtney] Like...
-And what did he say?

636
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,957
He was just being like a beast,
and I was like, "I'm getting out of here."

637
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,995
[Kourtney] And I was like, "I'm leaving,"
and I just left.

638
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:52,237
I feel like whenever Scott seems to be
on a good path, something happens.

639
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:57,375
[Kourtney] I think that it's not fair
because it comes off of me

640
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:00,378
telling him that I'm in a relationship.

641
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:05,116
It seems like when I'm happy
and in a good place in my life,

642
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:09,287
then Scott does something
to get my attention.

643
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,855
I wanna be supportive,

644
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,192
but I think it's time that I set
some new boundaries with Scott.

645
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,128
-Now, you said he's at home.
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

646
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,964
-[Khloé] And was he good?
-I don't know.

647
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,636
I talked to him last night.
He asked for his passport, watches...

648
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,770
So typical.

649
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,373
Credit cards that I took.

650
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,575
[Kourtney] So...

651
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:34,245
I mean, I'm happy he's better
or doing somewhat better.

652
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,349
[upbeat music]

653
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:45,857

[Kris] Hey, guys.

-Hey, Mom.
-Hi. What's going on?

656
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,498
[Kris] I heard you had some business
things you want to discuss.

657
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,735
[Kourtney] I just feel like I need to do
something creative.

658
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,103
Like design stuff.

659
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,638
-So I want to do my own line...
-[Kim] You've got the credibility.

660
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,340
...starting with accessories,

661
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,477
and then I'd like to produce a show
or something like that,

662
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:09,214
that's, like, just more things
to get me into that space.

663
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,517
Yeah. Start focusing
on what you want it to look like,

664
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,819
and then you go out there and you get it.

665
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,757
You design it, and you start doing
your homework and your due diligence.

666
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,824
[Kourtney] Okay.

667
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,194
[Kim] I mean, you're just really
passionate about something,

668
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,296
and then I feel like
there's always one thing...

669
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,932
If it doesn't go perfectly your way,

670
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,835
then you just drop the ball on it,
and you're, like, over it.

671
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,104
[Kim] When, like, that's just not
how it should be.

672
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,005
[Kris] Yeah.

673
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,975
I want you to find something

674
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,778
that you really want to do
and that you love to do

675
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,679
so that you can do it for years to come.

676
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:46,050
You know, Kim threw herself
into her makeup and realized...

677
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:50,321
You said to me one day,
"Mom, this is like a 24-hour-a-day job.

678
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,723
That's what it's gonna take."

679
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,827
But you have a different work ethic
than the rest of us,

680
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:59,130
and part of that isn't working
as hard as everyone else.

681
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,601
It doesn't mean
that I can't still do something,

682
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:07,705
just because if I don't wanna do it
exactly like everybody else does.

683
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,340
-And I want to...
-[Kris] It's... it's about...

684
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,043
-...put my priorities differently.
-...the energy that you put out there,

685
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,045
and the way that you go
about doing things.

686
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,015
You don't wanna give
as much as the rest of us

687
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,483
have to give to make things happen.

688
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,520
And I don't, and I agree with you,
but that's...

689
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,323
That doesn't mean
I'm not gonna do anything.

690
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,159
[Kourtney]
It just needs to make sense for my kids.

691
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,728
-I get that. You've got a lot of things...
-Yeah, I just think your work ethic

692
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:31,896
is just a little different.

693
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:32,931
It is, and I'm...

694
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,432
But I'm fine with that.

695
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,068
What you could do would be quite powerful
and I...

696
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,404
and I'm quite sure very successful.

697
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,639
You just have to put your mind to it.

698
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,741
[Kim] You have to, like, stay focused.

699
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:44,843
That's all.

700
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,278
I'm not sitting here dilly-dallying.

701
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,748
[upbeat music]

702
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,589
{\an8}[Khloé] Mom?

703
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,857
[Kris] Yeah?

704
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,358
What are you doing?

705
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,726
[Kris] Walking!

706
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,230
I have a Fitbit, so I'm counting my steps.

707
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,466
I need to get 10,000 steps a day.

708
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,400
Okay.

709
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,003
[Kris] So I wanted to talk to you...

710
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:19,644
really, about that whole
"my body being cremated

711
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,180
and then turned into a diamond," kind of.

712
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,415
[quirky music]

713
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,187
Kim warned me about my mom
and this obsession

714
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:33,591
that she has
with turning her ashes into stone.

715
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,394
[Khloé] I guess I'm the next one
on the list

716
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,795
that has to hear it from her.

717
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:42,200
And it... The whole thing
is just so confusing to me,

718
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,436
and I really have been
under so much stress about it.

719
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,338
I really think about it all the time,

720
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:52,277
and I don't think I can take
the anxiety of it all.

721
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,178
My heart just can't take it anymore.

722
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,215
I just wanted to tell you because I think,

723
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,151
right now, you're the only one
paying attention to me.

724
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,888
Well, maybe 'cause you're walking
and pacing when you talk to people.

725
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,356
[laughs]
I know. Isn't it great?

726
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,891
So I don't really care.

727
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,394
My body here doesn't, like, matter to me.

728
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,197
Like, I... I know that all that matters
is where I am in heaven...

729
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,133
-Yeah.
-...and, like, so that's what matters to me,

730
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,201
so I just want everyone to be happy.

731
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,972
I don't really care where
my, like, human form goes.

732
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,073
Yeah.

733
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,409
I've seen my dad one...
my dad's grave one time.

734
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,610
I think that's such...

735
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:29,180
To me, my personality is,
I think a grave is bull[bleep].

736
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,015
I don't care for that stuff.

737
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,917
Like, I talk to my dad every day.

738
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,786
That's what I do. I pray.

739
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,387
[Khloé] Like, my dad's not there.

740
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,555
He's not buried in dirt.

741
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,958
Like, that's, like, ridiculous to me.

742
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,194
Yeah. I think I'm kind of with you,

743
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,431
and maybe that's why I started thinking
about being cremated.

744
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,867
[Kris] But on the other hand,
I just want to be all together.

745
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,869
It's just too confusing.

746
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,771
And I don't really think
I want to be a diamond.

747
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,173
I'd rather wear a diamond.

748
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,240
[Khloé] Okay.

749
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,711
As much as I want to be in control
of this whole situation,

750
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,013
I think I have decided

751
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,016
to let my kids worry about it
when the time comes.

752
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,219
[Kris] I am not gonna stress myself out
about it anymore.

753
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,055
The truth is, it doesn't matter
where my body goes

754
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,424
because I will always be with my kids.

755
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,860
[Khloé] How many steps are you at?

756
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,895
[Kris] Ninety three hundred.

757
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,664
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

758
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,199
You'll show me what? I don't have one.

759
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,569
I'm gonna show you the pace,
but I have one to mark it.

760
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,172
[Kris] You can just walk around
while you're on the phone,

761
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,475
and you, like, don't waste energy.

762
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,878
Like, you're on the phone...
I don't like that face, missy. Come on.

763
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,148
-See? A little loop around the kitchen.
-[Khloé] We're like <i>The Golden Girls.</i>

764
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,650
Yeah. This is how they worked out.

765
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,786
[upbeat music]

766
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,589
Sister time.

767
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,691
Hey, guys.

768
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:53,631
-[Kim] What's going on? You're so skinny.
-[Kourtney] I know. I'm 97 pounds again.

769
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,901
When I go on vacation,
I swear I ate croissants.

770
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,704
Like, chocolate croissants every morning.

771
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:00,872
[Kourtney] Oatmeal.

772
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,106
Like, everything.

773
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,942
-[Kim] Living it up.
-And I just... lose weight.

774
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,444
So what's going on with Scott?

775
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,546
Like, what kind of boundaries
are you setting?

776
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,583
I mean, I've made it clear to Scott
that he dictates his own...

777
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,054
path. Like, if he's in a good place,

778
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,259
like, he can come around
and, you know, be a part of things.

779
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:25,730
I just... I don't care as much
to be, like, monitoring...

780
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,031
[Kim] Mm-hmm.

781
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:31,936
...his every move, as long as
I can tell that he's, like, okay.

782
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:36,140
I just feel like I just want him
to be happy and healthy.

783
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:40,578
Look, I'll always be there for him,
and, like...

784
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,482
-You know, as much as I can be.
-You want the best for him,

785
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,217
but you also now have your life,

786
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:49,720
and you have to,
like... have these boundaries.

787
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,989
[somber music]

788
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:56,027
I just think Scott
has to figure this all out on his own.

789
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,330
Like, he's 34 years old, you know?

790
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,199
Like, he's got to know what to do if he...

791
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,868
It just... It's like,
what life does he want to live?

792
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,136
It's not up to me.

793
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,539
It's up to him. Like, I...
There's only so much I can do,

794
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,775
-and I think I've done it all.
-[Kim] Yeah.

795
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:15,513
I think I've spent ten years, you know,
doing the best that I could

796
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,115
to make sure he was okay.

797
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,750
But if he truly doesn't want it
for himself,

798
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,619
there's nothing that I can do.

799
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,957
He's gone through this
99,000 times already.

800
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,492
I feel you.

801
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:32,063
Whatever changes he wants to make,
he has to do it himself.

a little bit.

00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:32,323
He's just very inspiring and motivating,
and just always has great ideas.

820
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,458
[Kourtney] So I wanted to pick your brain

821
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,496
because I feel like my sisters
keep putting all this pressure on me.

822
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,064
-[Martyn] Let's sit down, please.
-Okay.

823
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,999
It's... it's a proper conversation.

824
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:46,504
Um, so my sisters, you know,
they keep, like, saying,

825
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,673
"Well, what's your passion?
What are you gonna do?"

826
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:53,644
And I finally feel, like, at the place
where I could take something else on.

827
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,547
I mean, I... having worked with you
for the last couple years,

828
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,683
and, you know, I love you.

829
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:03,054
I think you've got an unbelievable
talent inside of you for design.

830
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,756
And I've seen you learn.

831
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:09,126
You know, I just tell you one thing,
and you go off and learn the whole book.

832
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,463
But I feel that...
I feel that first and foremost,

833
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,632
it's an amazing blessing
to be a Kardashian,

834
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,201
and it's a really difficult situation too

835
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,737
because whatever you do
to go into any field,

836
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,939
people are gonna want to put you down
immediately.

837
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:27,178
So you need to really find
a specialized area you want to get into.

838
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,648
[Martyn] Maybe put together some samples,
or put together some storyboards.

839
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,917
-You know, like we did for your house?
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.

840
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:37,922
Of images, of looks, of things,
that you can take and then present.

841
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,490
If you go in with those ideas...

842
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,026
And you have those ideas
because you tell them to me,

843
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:46,631
I feel like you can transition that
and really kind of carve your niche.

844
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,833
-[Martyn] You could be amazing.
-Yeah.

845
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:53,037
I... I can happily help introduce you
to some of... even some of my licensees,

846
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,140
some of the things
that I've got coming out and doing now.

847
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,409
'Cause I have eight new lines coming out

848
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,212
-in the next seven months.
-That's amazing.

849
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:06,350
I'm realizing that I don't need
my sisters' permission,

850
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,353
ideas, or feedback to do my own thing.

851
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,625
Everybody finds their path
at different times,

852
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,028
whether it's interior design
or something else.

853
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:20,665
I'm just at a place right now in my life
with work and relationships

854
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,867
where I feel like I need to take charge

855
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:26,737
and really live life for myself
and for my kids.

856
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,606
{\an8}-It's so good to see you.
-As always.

857
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:32,710
{\an8}-I'm so happy we, like, got...
-Me too. Me too. I'm so excited.

858
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,612
-It's so good.
-Yeah, can't wait to see the...

859
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,380
The photos. Yeah.

860
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,648
-[Kourtney] What?
-Monster!

861
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,417
-[Kourtney] A monster?
-Yeah. Come on!

862
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,152
Okay. Hurry.

863
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,653
-[Richard laughs]
-[Reign] Let's go!

864
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,624
[Reign laughing]

865
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,793
Hey. Hey.

866
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:54,098
My new best friend. Sorry, Malika. Say hi.

867
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,336
{\an8}[Kourtney] Ugh, these cookies are...

868
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,371
[Mason] Oh, I want one! I want one!

869
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,506
Okay, you can have one,
and then that's it, okay?

870
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:03,741
-[Mason] Okay.
-'Cause you had...

871
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,209
You had one earlier, right?

872
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,711
-[Mason] You said you had three?
-Oh.

873
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,479
-[Kourtney] Actually, I had two.
-[Mason] Oh.

874
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,747
[Kourtney] So now we're even.

875
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,916
-[Scott] You look like the Fonz.
-[Kourtney] He does.

876
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,284
With his sleeves all up,

877
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,187
he's like, "I'm gonna brush my hair
the way Mama likes it."

878
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,656
[Kourtney] I love it like that, Mase.

879
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,891
-You want to take that to our house?
-What?

880
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:21,892
-Want to take that to our house?
-Yeah.

881
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,028
-Oh, you're gonna stay at Dad's?
-[Mason] Mm-hmm.

882
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,129
It's fun.

883
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,864
I like the scenery,

884
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,265
the quiet.

885
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,200
[Kourtney] At Dad's?

886
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,769
{\an8}Yeah, I like to be with my father.

887
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:32,670
[Kourtney chuckles]

888
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,938
That's my brother.

889
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,907
That's nice, Mase.

890
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,242
[scoffs]

891
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,312
It's crazy how old he's getting.

892
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,414
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-How old are you?

893
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,516
Seven and a half.

894
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,918
[somber music]

895
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,620
[Scott] You know, I definitely realize now

896
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,956
a lot of the mistakes
that I've made in the past.

897
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,758
I think, you know,
I've learned a lot from it,

898
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,493
and I've been able to mature from it.

899
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,828
And I think one
of my biggest concerns is that

900
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:01,298
I really just don't want
to jeopardize my relationship

901
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:04,769
with Kourtney as a friend
because of our children.

902
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:09,740
And I just needed to watch out
for myself, to keep a...

903
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,177
decent lifestyle to be around my family.

904
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,746
Oh, we've got to get going.
We've got a date with destiny.

905
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,081
Give me a kiss.

906
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,819
-I'll see you at the bus stop tomorrow.
-What?

907
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,320
We literally sound like a homeless family.

908
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:24,722
The bus stop?

909
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,056
[Mason] Really? Are you dropping me?

910
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,691
I'm dropping you at the bus stop,

911
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,660
{\an8}and then you're gonna wait there
until Mom pulls up.

912
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,996
{\an8}[Scott] That's where we gonna meet,
and then you'll hop into her car.

913
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,998
-[Mason] We got a date with destiny!
-All right.

914
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,534
Love you, partner.

915
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,770
[Scott] I'll see you
in the business side of things.

916
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:40,938
[Kourtney] Okay.

917
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,473

924
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,953
{\an8}I haven't been to a Fashion Week
in a while, and I'm just so excited.

{\an8}[background chatter]

926
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,925
{\an8}[Kim] TMZ just posted
that my surrogate is pregnant.

927
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,928
{\an8}The identity of our surrogate

928

got leaked.
