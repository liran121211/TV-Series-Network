{\an8}So we'll design it on paper first
until you're 100 percent, uh...

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,382
{\an8}with the design,
and then we rock 'n' roll.

00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:18,818
-I feel like I have to throw up.
-Are you the Foodgod or not?

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,121
[Jonathan] I am so the Foodgod.

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,324
I live to eat. It's like... it's like...
It's, like, kind of my thing.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,594
So there's no better way
to start getting a first tattoo.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,629
[Jonathan] Foodgod is just,
like, my natural being.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,532
My whole, like, passion
is eating and going to restaurants.

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,602
-Churros! You were right.
-I told you. I found the churros!

11
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,905
[Jonathan] This is so good.
This was worth the trip.

[laughter]

13
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,476
People now really, like,
look to you to be, like,

14
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,778
"Where should I eat?"

15
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,648
See, his necklace says "Foodgod"
and then a caviar spoon?

16
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,718
This lighting is perfect for the spoon.

17
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,387
My God. This is the pain I'm scared of.
It's happening?

18
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,423
-All right. Ready, brother?
-Yeah.

then goes into a knife.

-[Jonboy] That's what she said.
-Hold on two seconds.

30
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,550
Let me just stretch my arm.
Can you pull this off, please?

00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,188
-[Jonathan] Not fair. That's good.
-[Jonboy] One more line.

-Man up, dude.
-Yo, be quiet.

33
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,427
All right. You are officially Foodgod.

00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,762
[Jonathan groans]

35
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:36,696
Oh, my God.

-No, it's...
-Don't...

-I'm joking.
-Don't say... I already.

that Scott was with all these girls?

[Kendall] <i>Bro, bro, bro. It was very, um...</i>

Calculated.

53
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:41,461
Scott saw Kourtney with a guy friend,
so he wants to one-up her. Perfect.

54
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:46,633
He's so predictable.
It's so slimy and gross and ugh.

55
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,802
Well, what did he do with Bella?
He just left her there somewhere?

56
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,205
[Kendall] <i>Bella must be,
like, freaking out.</i>

57
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,040
Simon said he, like, brought Bella

to be at LAX with him
so he could get paparazzi shots,

59
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,546

he called me, and he was like,</i>

In Cannes, she's going with Younes."</i>

go as soon as Kourtney's going."</i>

"I know, and I'm bringing Bella."</i>

<i>"You're bringing her?"
And he goes, "Yeah."</i>

66

<i>Like, this is insane that you're gonna
give the attention to bring her around."</i>

<i>And he was like, "Really?
How do I tell her?" Blah, blah, blah.</i>

71
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,976
<i>Like, I thought he really was gonna do it,</i>

through the airport with her, I was like,</i>

-Mm.
-That makes me feel empty inside. Empty.

-You know what makes me feel empty inside?
-[Kris] What?

107

Maybe I could be a Cleveland mascot.

108
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,132
[Kris] Yeah. We could be mascots.

-Like a trim?

133
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,568
It's summer. Shave the sides.
He'll look so cute.

134
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,370
-[Kim] Oh, what's this?
-[Jonathan] That's the grilled cheese one?

135

-[Jonathan] Yeah. This is yummy.

an appointment with you?

144

When do you schedule appointments with me?

145
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,034
-I haven't seen you!
-Because I was traveling, you whore.

146
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,369
[Khloé] Can I ask a question?

147
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:47,073
Did you think there was, like,
a dick-measuring contest happening?

148
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,043
-I was not doing anything to, like...
-No, no. I don't think you were.

149
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,313
But did you see all the shenanigans
Scott was doing?

150
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,016
-Yes. But I was just there living life.
-You did?

151
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,918
-[Khloé] You were measuring one dick.
-Yeah.

152
00:06:58,985 --> 00:06:59,819
Got it.

[Kourtney]
But then Scott has been calling me.

154
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,159
-[Khloé] This is what he does.
-But he goes, does the thing.

155
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,693
[Kourtney] I'm his therapist.

156
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,228
-He feels disgusting.
-"I'm the victim.

157
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,097
-This is what ha..."
-[Kourtney] Like, whatever.

158
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:15,101
-Yeah.
-So the energy that I put into him...

159
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,571
I just need to put into my kids.
I need to distance myself.

160
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:24,243
And just say, "You know what?
You, as a 34-year-old father of three,

161

like, you've got to know what to do
at this point."

162
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,882
[Khloé] For Scott, any attention
is good attention.

163
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,953
So the fact that Kourtney is now starting
to put up those boundaries

164
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,924
and not buy into every time he cries wolf,
that's a huge turning point for her.

165
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,460
And I'm really proud of her
and I see a lot of growth in her.

166
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,596
[Khloé] Do you have a boyfriend?

167
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,400
-No.
-Good. I like that answer.

168
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,403
[Khloé] And you met him in Paris
when you were with Kim for Fashion Week.

169
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,308
Yeah. We, like, walked into a bar,
and Stephanie was across from me,

170
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,711
and she kept going,
"This guy's cute over here."

171
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:02,381
And you picked him up?
Can't even see you doing this.

172
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,350
[Kourtney] He was friends
with our friends.

173
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,118
-Okay.
-He would walk in.

174
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,155
Like, say hi, shake hands
with, like, our security or whatever,

175
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,591
but, like, not say hi to us.

176
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,759
[Kourtney] And then I was like,
"Why do you hate us?"

177
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,428
[Kourtney laughs]
Like, I was just drunk.

178
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,497
Oh, my God.

179
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,833
Once I said that,
he literally grabbed my hand and was like,

180
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,535
"It's five in the morning. We're leaving."

181
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,136
-Oh.
-And...

182
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,440
the next night,
Younes was like, "Bring your ass here."

183
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,075
You like when he's, like, aggressive.

184
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,042
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-Yeah.

185
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,146
And then when we walked into that club
is when we went to the bathroom

186
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,748
and got the phone call about Kim.

187
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,085
-Oh.
-So then the party was over.

188
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,420
[both laughing]

189
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,123
-You think?
-And then, he was like,

190
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,058
"I'm not leaving you guys." And he, like,

191
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,794
-had to translate everything.
-I heard Kim said he was the translator.

192
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,695
[Kourtney] Yeah.

193
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,798
Do you guys plan
on seeing each other soon?

194
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,935
Or is it just, like,
"See you when I see you" type of sitch?

195
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,204
"See you when I see you, bitch."

196
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,140
[laughter]

197
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,444
[upbeat music]

198
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,282
-[Kim] Hey, Mom!
-[Kris] Hi.

199
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,150
-[Kris] Is this for KKW?
-Yeah.

200
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:15,988
-You look beautiful.
-I'm going to start a really crazy diet.

201
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,057
-Really?
-[Kim] Yeah.

202
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:22,428
So last night, after dinner with Jonathan,
I was so full,

203
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,797
I realized I cannot eat like this anymore.

204
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,533
Like, I just can't.
I just have to get it together.

205
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,938
I was looking on Instagram,
and this bodybuilder popped up on my page.

206
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,707
And she had gained 70 pounds
in her pregnancy.

207
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,542
Her kid's, like, six, now.

208
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:40,279
But she, um, is, like, ripped.

209
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,983
[Kim] Melissa is a trainer that I found.

210
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,118
She's super inspiring to me,

211
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:50,423
and I really want to meet up with her
and see if she could train me.

212
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:55,027
She can help direct my food
and really get me on an amazing path.

213
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,664
Even if I was 10 percent like her,
you know what I mean,

214
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,968
like, it would just be life-changing.

215
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,070
[Kris] So do you think it's food
or it's workout?

216
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,538
Well, mostly food.

217
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,573
-[Kim] I'm meeting with her in New York.
-Stop.

218
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,043
Yeah. I've got to have this lifestyle.
I got to try.

219
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,046
[upbeat music]

220
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,887
{\an8}[Kris] Oh, my God.
North was so cute last night.

221
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,056
[Kim] North slept over Mom's by herself.

222
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,826
-[Kris] Her and I in the bed.
-I think she liked it by herself

223
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,628
-[Kris] Yeah.
-Instead of with the other kids.

224
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:32,098
Except she saw these pictures
of P and Mason.

225
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,735
And she goes, "Lovey, Mason, P."

226
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,270
And I go, "Yeah."
And she goes, "Where's North?"

227
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,672
-[Kim] Aw.
-[Kris chuckles]

228
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,407
[Kris] It was so cute.

229
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,075
[Khloé] I got to talk to you about Scott.

230
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,043
Listen.

231
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,714
It's crazy, what happened in Cannes.

232
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,449
[Khloé] I'll just ask you this question.

233
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,685
Do our relationships change with Scott?

234
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,754
[soft tense music]

235
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,190
-Well, that's what I'm so confused.
-That's a Kourtney question, I guess.

236
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,593
His birthday's tomorrow, right?

237
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,663
Yeah, I'm not buying him a gift.
He... He gets coal. Like, he's been...

238
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,631
-What are you, Santa?
-[Khloé] Yeah.

239
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,566
Do we even say happy birthday,
or do we ice him?

240
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,835
Yeah, you say happy birthday.
You don't ice him on all...

241
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:13,005
-Yeah, you have to say that.
-It's very convenient in his timing.

242
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,141
It's always at Christmas or, like,
Mother's Day

243
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,475
when he does that whole thing.

244
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,543
Mm.

245
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,313
[Khloé] So Cleveland.
Kourtney's claimed she wants to go,

246
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,182
and Rob always says, "I'm coming,"...

247
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,650
-[Kris] Oh, my God.
-...but he won't.

248
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,887
[Kris] I bet that if you called Rob,
he would go with me.

249
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,855
[Khloé] I'll call him.
We talk all the time.

250
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,091
[line ringing]

251
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,026
-[Rob] <i>Hello?</i>
-[Khloé] Hey.

252
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,662
{\an8}-Hey, Rob.
-[Rob] <i>Yo. What's going on?</i>

253
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,166
{\an8}Can you do, um, one of the games?

254
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:45,538
[Rob] <i>I am not gonna let nobody say
I'm the reason why they lost. Sorry.</i>

255
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,507
<i>Sometimes, you just have
to take a step back,</i>

256
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,810
<i>lock in from home, and watch those games.</i>

257
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:52,912
[Khloé] Rob has a point.

258
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,614
I never even thought
how people are gonna react to my family.

259
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,718
I just don't want my family
to be at any like, negative aspect

260
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,886
when it comes to Tristan's career.

261
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,388
[Khloé] I can't handle this.

262
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,925
Rob, why are you telling me this?
Now I'm stressed out.

263
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,162
{\an8}[upbeat music]

264
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,533
[doorbell rings]

265
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,269
-[Khloé] She's gonna kick your ass.
-[Kim] I know.

266
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,110
-[Kim] Hi. How are you?
-Hi! Good!

267
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,412
{\an8}-[Kim] Nice to meet you.
-You too.

268
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,782
-[Kim] This is Khloé.
-[Khloé] Hi. How are you?

269
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,884
-[Kim] Thank you for coming.
-[Melissa] Of course.

270
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,220
[Khloé] How did you get
into your fitness journey?

271
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,990
I was just tired of eating
all this low-fat stuff.

272
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,725
I'd work out sometimes,

273
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,262
and nothing's working for me,
so it was, like, a ripple effect.

274
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:48,968
Learning what to eat and how much to eat.
It's, like, kind of making food simple.

275
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,371
Fresh and good, and portion control, too.

276
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,573
[Kim] See, that's the stuff
I'm really bad at.

277
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,976
But that is where our brains are [bleep].

278
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,845
How old are we and we've ate this way
for this many years?

279
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:00,946
Think about it.

280
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,850
It's your hand putting that
into your mouth.

281
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,119
You have control. You know what I mean?

282
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,822
-Like, as much you think...
-[Khloé] But do we? Like...

283
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,957
-No, we do. I know.
-You have control.

284
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,426
-You know, you want long-lasting results.
-[Kim] Mm-hmm.

285
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:19,765
You want to... You want to implement this
into your everyday lifestyle.

286
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,301
[Kim] So what kind of workouts do you do?

287
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,704
So I may kill you.

288
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,373
-[Melissa] No, no, no. It's a mix.
-[Kim] Yeah.

289
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,342
I like, like,
low-intensity interval training.

290
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,179
I have high intensity,
and then weight training.

291
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,482
I'm super motivated.
I'm super, just, really wanting to...

292
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,750
Because, like, you get into it.

293
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,486
We got to have a slice of pizza
to say goodbye.

294
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,423
-[Khloé] It's our goodbye day.
-We can have one slice.

295
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,558
Yeah. One slice.

296
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,860
-Cheers to one goodbye slice.
-Our goodbye pizza.

297
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,228
Okay.

298
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,463
[upbeat music]

299
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,704
If I could have one last meal,
it would be New York pizza.

300
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,574
What? I don't understand...
You're gonna become a bodybuilder?

301
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,009
-No. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna like,...
-Is that the lifestyle?

302
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,513
...compete and be, like, a bodybuilder,
I just want a good body.

303
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,418
Not happy about it. Like, come on!
I can't just let you go. I need closure.

304
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,722
Before you start with this
"lifestyle" thing that you're doing,

305
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,959
we need to go, like, on a fun
Foodgod adventure binge for the day.

306
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,026
I'm so down.

307
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,895
-[Kim] But just let's not go crazy.
-That's it.

308
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:23,796
[chuckles]

309
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,400
-[Khloé] Thank you.
-[reporters clamoring]

310
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,736
-[Jonathan] How are you?
-Yes, sir?

311
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,937
-[Jonathan] The regular slices.
-A regular.

312
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,074
It's day one of our diet plan.

313
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,043
-Last supper. The Foodgod knows.
-How exciting is this?

314
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,379
Kim is going in
before her fitness journey.

315
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,083
-[Khloé] Thank you so much.
-[Kim] Thank you, guys.

316
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,353
We are such animalistic...

317
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,289
This is better than any New York pizza
you're ever gonna get.

318
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,725
Holy [bleep]. I need some air on.
I'm about to go...

319
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,729
I'm literally, like, one of those fat kids

I want to know what her daily routine is.

365
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:52,044
I'm excited too. I just feel like we have
to, like, hide, like, under the radar.

[Khloé] It's, like, so scary.
People are yelling at us.

480
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,303
-Did you guys see that guy?
-[Simon] What?

481
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,072
-"[bleep] the Kardashians."
-[Simon] Where?

482
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,340
I don't know, that guy.

483
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,842
Hold on. Let me get a picture of it first.

484
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,844
-Mom, you're gonna play that game?
-[Kris] Yeah.

485
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,948
How do I... "Five dollars a play."
Okay. So how do I go up?

486
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,384
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Simon laughs]

487
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,153
[Kris] Oh, [bleep].

488
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,622
-Okay, now I got it.
-[Khloé] Mom, you're on your knees?

489
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,125
-[Simon] Oh...
-[Kris] Oh, [bleep].

490
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,194
I didn't mean to do that.
I need my wallet.

491
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,963
-[Simon] No, you're good.
-[Kris] Okay, okay, this is it.

492
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,532
-Mom...
-Don't distract me. Oh, [bleep].

493
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,102
Oh, [bleep], I can't. I let go too fast.

494
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:53,305
You already have the shoes, though,
so I don't understand.

495
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,874
-[Simon] She just wants to win.
-Yeah, I want to win.

496
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,676
-[game whirring]
-[bleep]

497
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,981
-[Simon] Oh!
-Oh!

498
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,249
[Simon] One more time. Come on.

499
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,017
[Kris] One more time.
Okay, make it or break it.

500
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,422
{\an8}[upbeat music]

501
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,733
[Scott] This house looks pretty sick.

502
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,037
-I mean, it feels a little bare, but dope.
-Yeah.

503
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,173
We just don't want to put our art in here.

504
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,710
Like, we just would rather...
It's, like, all in crates.

505
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,612
You know, my house got robbed again.

506
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:37,082
[Kim] No way. On your Cannes extravaganza?

507
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,650
-No, it was before Cannes.
-[Kim] Mm.

508
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,686
It just looked like
it was some big soap opera going on.

509
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,789
[Kim] It was, like, a fun show.

510
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,458
[Scott] I didn't see the show
because I was living it.

511
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,828
-[Kim] Yeah.
-[Scott] But look at it in my perspective.

512
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,664
She was on vacation with one man.

513
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,566
-A whole trip.
-[Kim] Yeah.

514
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,668
That looks like a happier scenario

515
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,904
than me jumping around
trying to find happiness.

516
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,374
And these girls are not fulfilling that.
I'm just not happy with anybody.

517
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,510
Yeah. Honestly, I think it's,
like, beyond the girls at this point.

518
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,646
I think if you found someone
that you were happy with,

519
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,381
I think Kourtney would be happy for you.

520
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,051
But she sees you out and really drinking
and really going through it.

521
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,719
Like, she just had concern.

522
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,988
[intense music]

523
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,857
[Scott] Well, she sure didn't say that...

524
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,159
-not once to me.
-But she has to move on with her life if...

525
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,628
-that's where she feels like it's going.
-[Scott] And she is.

526
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,198
There is where I think
you're not getting it.

527
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,600
[Scott] I get it. It's not right.
And I can understand.

528
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,237
[music fades]

529
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:36,041
You know, when I was at Cannes,
I mean, it wasn't good, to say the least,

530
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,643
and I understood where Kim
was coming from and it's tough.

531
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,446
[Scott] I mean,
I don't live the cleanest-looking life.

532
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,348
I'm a guy. I'm a little younger.

533
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:48,086
Maybe the way I'm getting over her
is a drop different and it's hard.

534
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,921
I don't really know what to do,
but it's like,

535
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,423
if I step out of line one way,

536
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,692
I can lose everybody
in a matter of a second.

537
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:57,996
Sometimes I just feel kind of insecure.
Like, if Kourtney met somebody,

538
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,066
fell in love, got married,
and then everyone's like...

539
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,336
"We have a new Scott. Like, we don't
really need to be close with him anymore."

540
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:07,272
-Even though I get it. We have kids.
-[Kim] We always would.

541
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,074
But it's a scary thing for me.

542
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,745
My true advice would just be,
let's cross that bridge when we get to it.

543
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,215
As him and Kourtney
transition into, you know,

544
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,150
this new normal
of what their relationship is

545
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:23,688
and what their boundaries are, and Scott,
it's taking him a little bit longer.

546
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,991
Or a lot longer than Kourtney maybe.

547
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,226
-All right. I love you.
-Okay. Bye.

548
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,160
No judgment.

549
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,998
[dramatic music]

550
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:45,143
{\an8}-Hi. Look at you. This is so gorgeous.
-[Khloé] You look so pretty.

551
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,879
Driving in here and all those houses.

552
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,282
-Do you want me to carry this?
-No, it's for you and Tristan.

553
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,684
-That's some of our favorite wine.
-Oh, my god. Thank you!

554
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:53,685
[Khloé] Oh, my goodness.

555
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,888
-This view is spectacular.
-[Khloé] Thank you.

556
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,391
-So nice of you.
-[Kris] Stunning. Stunning.

557
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,494
So how's Tristan?

558
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,729
[Khloé] He is fine.

559
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,364
-[Kris] Good.
-[Kourtney] Hi.

560
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,167
-Do you need help?
-[Khloé] No, thank you, Madame.

561
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,535
[Tristan] What's going on?

562
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,671
-Hi, you.
-Hey, darling.

563
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,206
-How are you?
-Look, she brought us all this wine.

564
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,175
-[Tristan] Oh, thank you.
-Lots of wine.

565
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,712
How are you? You look beautiful.

566
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,314
{\an8}-[Kris] How are you?
-I'm good. You?

567
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,150
{\an8}-Won't you say hi to Tristan? Say hi.
-[Tristan] What's up, P?

568
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,051
Oh.

569
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:30,622
Tristan's mom, his brothers are here,
and my family and my nieces and nephews

570
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:34,492
and everyone are here, and we're gonna
have just a nice family dinner together.

571
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,860
[Kris] You want me to open
a bottle of wine?

572
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,363
[Khloé] Wine glasses are downstairs
if you want to go.

573
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,166
I think having some family time
will be really good.

574
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,869
We could just enjoy and relax
and, like, not talk about the game.

575
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,573
What's going on, Kourt?
Cannes was good? Or Cannes or Cannes?

576
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,642
I heard you were on some boat, kicking it.

577
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,178
I forgot you and Khloé are invited
on the boat.

578
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,547
-I appreciate that.
-[Kourtney] I'm gonna tell her.

579
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,451
But I know that you're planning
a surprise birthday, right?

580
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,418
-[Tristan] Yeah.
-Okay.

581
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:01,653
We're gonna do it in LA, just...

582
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,588
-Because it's easy.
-Anything you need help with,

583
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,157
just tell us. She's upstairs.

584
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,861
-She has ears the size of Mickey Mouse.
-Okay.

585
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:10,996
[Tristan chuckles]

586
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:16,468
The fact that Tristan wants to plan
something for Khloé makes me so happy.

587
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:20,939
It really does because she's always
the one doing for everyone else.

588
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,743
And for me, I just feel like
Khloé's met her perfect match.

589
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,277
[camera shutter clicking]

590
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:29,147
-Ha, ha, ha, I got you to smile.
-[Kris] Thank you for having us.

591
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,149
-Thank you for coming.
-[Kris] I just really wanted

592
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:35,387
to see where you live,
and where Khloé spends all her time and...

593
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,422
-Yeah. Of course.
-I'm a little nosy.

594
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,491
-No.
-Yeah. I'm a little nosy.

595
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,427
You got to see where your baby girl's
laying her head down,

596
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,928
-make sure she's safe.
-Is that where you get

597
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,797
-your hair cut for real?
-Yup. Mm-hmm.

598
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,366
-That's so cute. Is that your glam room?
-Am I... Yeah.

599
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,901
[Kris] Do you always wear a beard?

600
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,803
-I like you clean-shaven.
-[Tristan] Yeah.

601
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,072
-[Khloé] Mom.
-No, I just wanted to ask

602
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,473
is there a superstition

603
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,077
-or is there a pregame, postgame...
-[Khloé] He likes to look tough.

604
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:03,248
Let's just, like, enjoy each other.
Be like... Just be cool.

605
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:06,451
-Okay. I can... I can be cool.
-Don't be uncool.

606
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,154
So are you exhausted?
How often do you practice?

607
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,025
What happens after the games are over?
How many years are you signed for?

608
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,861
And if somebody comes along and says,
"We want him..."

609
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,663
Do you ever think about that?

610
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,366
Dinner is served.

611
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,967
-[Kris] Thank God.
-[Tristan] Time to eat?

612
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:28,073
-Dinner's ready. Do you ever get sore?
-Do I ever get sore? Sometimes.

613
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,774
[Kris] I mean, I get sore after a workout.

614
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,310
I can't even imagine
how your body gets beat up.

615
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,113
Mom asks the wildest questions.

616
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,549
-What?
-She asks the wildest questions.

617
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,017
-What was she asking?
-[Kourtney] I don't know.

618
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,719
She just goes, "Do you get sore?"

619
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,787
-Like...
-[Khloé] Of course.

620
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:47,125
-Babe. I'm sorry. Here you go.
-[Kourtney] Mason, here's your fries.

621
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,794
[Kris] A lot of hungry boys around here.

622
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,231
-How are you feeling?
-[Khloé] I'm stressing. Yeah.

623
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,432
-You are?
-[Khloé] Yeah.

624
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,368
-Can I have a family meeting?
-[kids babbling]

625
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,639
{\an8}Should we stay here
and watch the game on TV,

626
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:05,677
or do you want us there,
right there next to you?

627
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,413
[tense music]

628
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,215
-[Tristan] No, you guys should be there.
-Are you sure?

629
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,182
-[Tristan] Yeah.
-Okay.

630
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,152
I know for a fact
that we're gonna win tomorrow.

631
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,321
I'm part of the team. I'm the mascot.

632
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,555
[laughter]

633
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,958
-It's all good, guys.
-[Khloé] Good.

634
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,630
I'm so happy that Tristan wants everyone
front and center supporting him.

635
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,333
And that's what matters to him.
And I love that...

636
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,169
That he...
He knows none of this [bleep] is real.

637
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,373
But sometimes, like, I even need
the reminder. So game on.

638
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,643
-Let's wear our jerseys.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

639
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,045
Reign, look how pretty the sunset is.

640
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,313
[Kris] This is so pretty.

641
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,215
[Tristan] I mean,
we should have started a fire.

642
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,785
[dramatic music]

643
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,759
{\an8}[Kim in high-pitched]
You want me to be a bear like you?

644
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:55,693
[North giggles]

645
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,328
{\an8}I know what you're thinking.

646
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,366
"Kardashians like basketball?"

647
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,067
{\an8}[fans chattering, cheering]

648
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:07,639
This is sincerely the best game
I've ever been to in my life.

649
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:08,807
-Ever.
-So fun.

650
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,743
[announcer] <i>Thompson this time, jump,
but still gets the rebound.</i>

651
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,545
<i>Back to James. He's fouled.</i>

652
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,913
[cheers and applause]

653
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:20,084
<i>Tristan Thompson on the offensive board.
Outstanding job.</i>

654
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,554
[indistinct chittering]

655
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,424
Ah, the cheering. Tristan's family,
our family were all there screaming.

656
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,359
-It's... Aah!
-The best.

657
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,495
[Kourtney] My kids had so much fun.

658
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,164
-They caught the T-shirts that they, like...
-It was so exciting. Yes.

659
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,034
...throw into the crowd.
They were so excited.

660
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,069
-[Khloé] And they won!
-[crowd cheering]

661
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,904
[whooping]

662
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,307
Was that too loud?

663
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,908
[man] We love you, Kris!

664
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,543
[crowd cheering]

665
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,646
[upbeat music]

666
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:53,218
It's four in the morning.
I'm so tired, but I can't fall asleep.

667
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,586
[Kanye groaning loudly]

668
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,486
[Kim laughs]

669
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,790
-[Kris] I think we're a good luck charm.
-[Khloé] Amen.

670
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,493
[yawns]
Now back to LA. Back to the grind.

671
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,296
-Everybody was really nice last night.
-[Khloé] Yeah.

672
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,965
I appreciate you coming.

673
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,168
Tristan really appreciates you guys coming
and Kourt bringing the kids.

674
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:14,038
It means so much to him, and even just
spending time with his family,

675
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:17,742
like, we don't get to do that a lot.
So it really means a lot that,

676
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,778
you know, during the season, it's hard
and he obviously can't come to us,

677
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,448
so it really means a lot
that you guys did all that.

678
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,951
After all of my stressing,
this trip could not have gone better.

679
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:30,688
I'm so grateful. People are always gonna
say what they want to say,

680
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:34,192
and I can't let them interfere
with my memories

681
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,894
and my quality time with my family.

682
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,965
I love to travel on weekends
because, when I land,

683
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:46,271
there won't be 75,000 messages
for me to put out fires, typically.

684
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,773
You know they have Wi-Fi these days.

685
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,845
-Yeah. They do? Wi-Fi.
-It's this magical thing called Wi-Fi.

686
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,014
[upbeat music]

687
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,218
-Hi.
-Hey.

688
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:04,322
Whatever green tea you're having
looks divine.

689
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,724
[Kourtney] Should I take my hat off
so I don't have a mark?

690
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:10,194
-Hi.
-How are you? What's up? What's up?

691
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,598
-I was literally sitting here last night.
-It felt like I'm going to church and...

692
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,134
Oh, well, then you shouldn't
wear the hat now.

693
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,336
[Jonathan] It's so weird
to be here in the day. This is horrifying.

694
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,939
-Really?
-Nobody eats dinner at 6:30. It's weird.

695
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,840
-[Kim] I know, but...
-[Jonathan] Everyone's dressed up.

696
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,076
-[waitress] How are you?
-[Kourtney] Thank you.

697
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,412
[Jonathan] Are you gonna send
some good stuff so I don't have to think?

698
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,947
Just some of the good things.

699
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,248
You know,
with the little thing with the caviar

700
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,616
and the thing with the beef and the thing...

701
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,352
Oh, can we get some plain French fries?

702
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,688
And then some crispy rice
or, like, rock shrimp.

703
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,456
[Jonathan]
Just bring a bunch. We're starving.

704
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,692
-Thanks.
-[Kim] You're not gonna tempt me on this.

705
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,827
-[Jonathan] I think I am.
-[Kim] No, you're not.

706
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,264
Jonathan knows that I am trying
to eat so healthy.

707
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:50,068
If he's not on my same page, I'm not gonna
be able to hang out with him anymore.

708
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,469
-Oh, no bread.
-[Kourtney] Oh...

709
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,605
-That pretzel bread and butter is divine.
-Thank you.

710
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,376
If I break this amazing food regimen
that I've been on,

711
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,944
It's gonna be... I'm gonna be [bleep].

712
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,946
{\an8}Can we get it off of this table?

713
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,314
[background chatter]

714
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,717
[tense music]

715
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,219
[Jonathan] Wow.

716
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,923
Don't want it. Mmm.

717
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,293
-Sorry.
-[Kim] Do you see how good I was?

718
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,095
-[Jonathan] Yeah.
-I didn't eat the fries.

719
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,231
I didn't eat the bread.
Good old-fashioned willpower.

720
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,000
[waitress] This is a chocolate
brown ganache...

721
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,768
[Jonathan] So this is like
a Foodgod dessert.

722
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,671
[waitress] And then you're gonna
take your spoon and you smack it.

723
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,841
This is a white chocolate ice cream,
devil's chocolate food cake.

724
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,510
And here we have a liquid Klondike bar.

725
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:35,013
[Kim] It's got all my favorite things.
I got to get out of here.

726
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,881
[waitress laughing]
Right? Just try...

727
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,750
[Jonathan] You could have this.
It's amazing.

728
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,285
[Kim] I like, legit,
have to stop being friends with you.

729
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,154
-Wow.
-Because I can't have the temptation.

730
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,355
I really can't.

731
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,592
We're officially breaking up
until I've gotten my rock-hard body

732
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,895
and I could at least eat and, like,
integrate normal food into my...

733
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,499
Come back.
[chuckles]

734
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,868
Please. I'm starving.

735
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,636
[Jonathan] Kourt, you ready for this?

736
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,440
-[Kourtney] Oh, my God.
-[Jonathan] Oh, it's on that hat.

737
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,908
-Oh, thank you.
-I'm sorry.

738
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,978
By the way, I did this to a girl's dress
the other day. She was covered at the...

739
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,647
-Stop. Why would you do that?
-I didn't do it on purpose.

740
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,283
That's the whole point of this.
It's called Hit Me.

741
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,451
-Oh, my God.
-I'm sorry.

742
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,087
It should come...
It should come with a warning.

743
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,156
[upbeat music]

744
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,365
{\an8}-[Reign] Dada!
-[Scott] Hi, Reignie. Hi, sweets.

745
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,267
[Reign speaks indistinctly]

746
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,235
{\an8}-Excuse me?
-Hold you.

747
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,137
-[Scott] You want me to hold you?
-Yeah.

748
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,406
-[Scott] How old are you?
-Good!

749
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,245
-Thank you, Dad.
-No problem.

750
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,114
-[Reign snickers]
-[Scott imitates dog barking]

751
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,015
[Reign laughs]

752
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,751
You're funny-looking, aren't you?
Give me a kiss.

753
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,786
Another one.

754
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,089
-[Khloé] Hello.
-[Scott] The Kokeser.

755
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:59,097
I mean, how long has it been
since I've seen you?

756
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,566
-[Scott] Probably a long time.
-[Malika] Really?

757
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,235
[Scott] What were you guys doing?
You're all sitting, drinking wine?

758
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,204
[Khloé] Mm-hmm. Chilling.

759
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,675
{\an8}I definitely haven't been in a room
with the two of you in a very long time.

760
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,077
[tense music]

761
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,046
[Malika] Would you guys have a fourth kid?

762
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,380
-Yeah.
-[Malika] You would?

763
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,515
Mm-hmm.

764
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,417
[Malika] Wait. So would you donate?

765
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,919
Or is this, like, a strict,
"You got to lay it down"?

766
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,188
[Scott] Whatever she wants, but...

767
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:28,826
Probably just do it, like, artificially,
just so it's, like, not weird.

768
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,394
-Did you know that?
-[Kourtney] What?

769
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,662
-That he would?
-[Malika] Yeah.

770
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,631
Yes, I know that he would.

771
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,434
I mean, I know you want
to have more kids, Kourtney, so...

772
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,568
[Kourtney] Yeah.

773
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,072
-There's no need in, um, planning for...
-What I was saying... what I was saying...

774
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,740
[Malika] He just said he would donate it.

775
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,876
-She brings up a very good point.
-He said you didn't have to lay down.

776
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,845
But he has a disrespectful nature
these days.

777
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,214
-[Scott] To who?
-What did you do, Scott?

778
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,216
-[Kourtney] To yourself. To me.
-Ah, to myself.

779
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,552
-To your children.
-[Scott] What have I done to you?

780
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,487
What do you mean?

781
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,558
-Kourtney, this is when you speak up.
-Yeah.

782
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,860
-[Malika] Right now.
-[Reign babbling]

783
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,198
I've got all my notes at home
written down from my venting sessions.

784
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:11,269
I definitely think that Kourtney's
got a lot of built-up anger towards me,

785
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,604
but at the end of the day...

786
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,708
we have three kids together.
That's not gonna change.

787
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,746
My biggest focus now
is just learning how to...

788
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,348
really legitimately move on

789
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:29,320
and think about doing a lot more
with my kids, without Kourtney.

790
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,656
-I'm gonna go take the kids to eat.
-[Kourtney] Thank you.

791
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,090
[Scott] You know, it's kind of nice

792
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,159
in some sense
that there's no more false hope.

793
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:41,132
It's just another transition
in a very weird part of being together

794
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,500
and not being together.

795
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,303
Kourtney, did I make you uncomfortable?

796
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,637
-Oh, no.
-Are you sure?

797
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,306
-Yeah.
-Okay. I'm sorry, but, like,

798
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,775
I haven't been around the two of you
in [bleep] forever.

799
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,911
-But I'm trying to switch it up...
-[Malika] Okay.

800
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,380
...and I don't need to have,
like, deep convos

801
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,517
when he's, like, feeling down
or, like, you know...

802
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,120
-It's, like, yes, I'm there, but I just...
-It's not your responsibility.

803
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,389
-Mm-hmm.
-[Khadijah] I think you can have peace

804
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,059
in knowing these children
were made with love.

805
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,628
This is their father. I'll always be
their mother, and, you know...

806
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,763
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-[Khloé] And they are from one guy.

807
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,065
Doesn't that make you happy?

808
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,101
[Malika] That's why I'm saying,
if she wants to have another one,

809
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,736
I'm like, just go ahead
and have it with him.

810
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,939
I think in that case,
I'd rather just not have another one.

811
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,075
[laughs]

812
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,477
[upbeat music]

813
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,549
I'm just really impressed
with your self-control.

814
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,050
-I think it's really good.
-Thank you.

815
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:36,821
It shows me that you are positively
thinking of changing a lifestyle.

816
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,357
[Kim] It's gonna take a lot of work,
but this is gonna work.

817
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:43,127
We just won't eat. I'll...
Here, I'll eat before I see you.

818
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,663
-Okay. Perfect. That's a good compromise.
-That's good. That's a great compromise.

819
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,400
'Cause when I'm fed, I'm like an animal.
So when you feed me, I'm like good after.

820
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,102
-[Jonathan] Kim?
-Hey.

821
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,004
By the way, this is pretty good for a...

822
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,374
-Somebody that eats 365 meals a day.
-Totally, but...

823
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,876
-Come on. This is, like...
-But you could... If you worked out...

824
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,478
I do work out. I'm starting to.

825
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,948
-You start and then you stop. Like...
-No, no. I have not stopped, by the way.

826
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,617
I go to the gym.
All you do is walk up and down hills.

827
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,854
[Jonathan] You're like a 97-year-old
granny, up and down all...

828
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,492
Every morning I'm in New York, I see,
"Here we go. I'm going walking."

829
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,994
[Kim] Hey, you guys.
I'm gonna go on a long walk.

830
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,929
-[Jonathan] "Here I go." Every morning.
-Okay.

831
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,665
-[Kim] Okay.
-Where's the exercise?

832
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,067
I want to see <i>The Golden Girls.</i>
Up and down the hill.

833
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,002
-Let's go right now. Let's go.
-Let's go.

834
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,237
-Let's go.
-[Kim] I have heels.

835
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,640
-I'm gonna drive you, drop you off...
-That's fine. I don't care. Let's go.

836
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,542
[Kim] You need to get out
at the stop sign.

837
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,244
-What do you mean? This is the hill?
-[Kim] Yeah. Get out.

838
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,112
-[Jonathan] How far?
-[Kim] Not even a mile.

839
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,881
-Get out.
-[Jonathan] I'm not walking a mile.

840
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,449
-I'm not walking a mile.
-[Kim] Get out.

841
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,885
-You're gonna walk at least a little bit.
-[Jonathan] Fine.

842
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,356
-Sprint to this light pole, so sprint one.
-[Jonathan] All right. Let's go.

843
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,392
[Kim] Come on. Good job.

844
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,129
Okay. Then, you can walk now.
From this light pole, just keep walking.

845
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,833
-[Jonathan] This is great for your ass.
-So then what I do is I do lunges.

846
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,669
-So, lunge from one pole to the next.
-I don't know what that means.

847
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,038
Lunge. Like, like a lunge.

848
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,507
-[Jonathan] Like a lunge?
-Like you're bending... Like...

849
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:04,608
[Kim chuckles]

850
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,445
-Is that a lunge?
-[Kim] One knee forward. Yeah.

851
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,513
But, like, you need way better form.

852
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:14,318
{\an8}-[Jonathan] Okay, I'm done.
-Nope. At least halfway.

853
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,354
-[Jonathan] This is not halfway?
-[Kim] No.

854
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,455
[Kim chuckles]

855
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:21,092
-[Jonathan] No, you...
-And you're calling me <i>The Golden Girls.</i>

856
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,060
[Jonathan] I hate you.

857
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,161
{\an8}[Kim] <i>On the next episode...</i>

858
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,731
{\an8}After ten years, it's finally here.

859
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:32,336
{\an8}I'm so excited. I'm watching KKW Beauty.
Get ready to be contoured.

860
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:37,108
{\an8}Khloé doesn't know that Tristan
planned a surprise party for her.

861
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,109
{\an8}[Khloé] Is this a bar?

862
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,277
{\an8}[indistinct chatter]

863
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,781
{\an8}[Scott] There's only one person
that would have gotten me not invited.

864
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,483
{\an8}It's funny how fake you really are though.

865
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:50,020
{\an8}You think you can purposely try to hurt me
and still get invited to everything.
