1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,005
{\an8}[Khloé] Queen of Cleveland!

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:09,309
{\an8}For the past eight months,
I have been basically bicoastal.

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,112
{\an8}I appreciate how comfortable
he wants me to be.

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:16,216
{\an8}It's just sad that she's, like,
definitely not coming back anytime soon.

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,988
{\an8}I have such anxiety, just going places.

6
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:26,059
{\an8}[Kim] I'm not as, like, open and out there
as I used to be.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,462
[upbeat music]

8
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,301
{\an8}[Scott] Oh! It is nice out.

9
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,804
-So, my dog's so cute.
-[Scott] Yeah.

10
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,274
-How old is that dog?
-[Khloé] Like, 12.

11
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,877
He's been living the dream.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,712
It's a she.

13
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,680
-[Scott] She has been living the dream.
-Mm-hmm.

14
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,649
-She's had two leg surgeries.
-She's travel a lot.

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,518
She's not living,
like, that big of a dream.

16
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,555
Can you... can you not jiggle your butt
when you're talking to me?

17
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,024
[Khloé] First of all, the fact that you
were staring at that...

18
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,959
-I was jiggling my leg.
-I mean, how can I not?

19
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,262
I was trying to get my face out of the sun
and then I glanced over your butt.

20
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,563
[Khloé] That's wild that that's what
you looked at.

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,665
I was, literally, out of just like a tic.

22
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,467
It's not a tic. You're literally twerking.

23
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,903
-No. I'm literally shaking my leg.
-[Scott] Are you joking me?

24
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,372
It looks like a vibrator lodged
into your ass right now.

25
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,074
Shut up. That's crazy.

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,109
It's not crazy. I'm trying to talk to you.

27
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,179
Your butt's just bouncing around town.
I feel like I'm at a strippy.

28
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,381
-[Scott] I have no cash on me.
-[Khloé] Oh, God.

29
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,450
[theme music]

30
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:52,846
{\an8}How beautiful is my country, people!
Oh, this is good.

31
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,380
Oh, yeah.

32
00:01:55,648 --> 00:02:01,654
There she is. The boss is here! The boss.
And I bet you didn't shut the door.

33
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,923
Remember when we had a scorpion
in the house?

34
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,627
-[Kourtney] No.
-I did, a big-ass scorpion.

35
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,562
[Khloé] And my floors are black.

36
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,364
-Remember when I got stung by a scorpion?
-What?

37
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,032
-There's a huge scorpion in the...
-[Kim] I didn't know that.

38
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,001
That's why we got to shut the doors.
[chuckles]

39
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,971
-[Khloé] Well, I have some news.
-[both] What?

40
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,610
-See how I'm building up the suspense?
-[Kim] What? Good news?

41
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:27,046
-What is it?
-Guess who's coming home, kids?

42
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,048
What? You guys broke up?

43
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,551
-[Khloé] Oh, stop. No!
-Just kidding.

44
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,455
No. Tristan and I will be here
from July to October.

45
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,626
-[Kim] What?
-July to October?

46
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,727
-[Kourtney] Three months.
-That's good,

47
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,195
'cause you live there most of the time,

48
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,130
so he can like then live where you live

49
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,565
-the other time.
-[Khloé] He was like, "I...

50
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,767
-want to, like, be with your family more."
-That's fair.

51
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,537
[Khloé] And like, he like, really wants
to, like, hang out with all of us more.

52
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,339
We're gonna be here,
but we also want a house in the city.

53
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,440
That's cool.

54
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,377
[Khloé] I love that Tristan was like,
"I want to be there this summer."

55
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,013
We're always in Cleveland and he...
not that he...

56
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,449
Like, he literally can't come here
and hang out with you guys.

57
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,853
He's like, "I want to be a part
of your family and do stuff as a group."

58
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,056
-Aren't you guys excited?
-[Kim] Yes!

59
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:14,194
Tristan and I were thinking about staying
in Cleveland for the summer,

60
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,830
but you know, we talked about it,
and we actually want to come to LA.

61
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,367
It's so nice. I've never had a guy,
like, want our families to blend before.

62
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,938
So Tristan and I
want to find a place in the city,

63
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:29,042
because Tristan does
two-a-day practices at UCLA.

64
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:29,976
[Khloé] And trust me,

65
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,881
nobody in LA wants to sit in traffic
for over two hours every single day.

66
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,618
Tristan has always gone out of his way
to make me feel at home,

67
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,287
and in Cleveland,
he's gone above and beyond.

68
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,256
So in LA, I want to do the same for him.

69
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,859
What if I jump from this one to that one?

70
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,862
Why are you sitting with your heels
in my couch, like this is a club?

71
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,498
I was gonna try to jump
from this one to that one.

72
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,666
[Khloé] No, you're not.

73
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,068
-On a stone table?
-[Kourtney] Have you ever poked a hole

74
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,036
-in a club with your heel?
-[Khloé] All the time.

75
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,272
No, you're going to poke a hole.

76
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,674
Oh, my god.

77
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,645
Oh, [bleep], I poked a hole.
I'm just kidding. Ha-ha. Gotcha!

78
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,313
[Kim laughs maniacally]

79
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,848
[Kim] Welcome home.

80
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,686
Okay, guys, I have to do 20 sprints today.

81
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,488
Don't take off my glasses.

82
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,190
Looking at the ocean?

83
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,228
{\an8}-[Jonathan] Kim, where you at?
-[Kim] I'm here.

84
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,664
-What's up?
-[Kim] Hey.

85
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,166
-What are you doing?
-[Kim] It could be folded in here, though.

86
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,234
[woman] Okay.

87
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,205
[Kim] Um, just going over all this stuff
I have in my closet

88
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,341
that I need to organize and trying to...

89
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,344
[Jonathan] Every time I come here,
you're organizing. Holy crap.

90
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,780
[Kim] You're gonna love
what I've been up to.

91
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,850
You probably think
I've been doing nothing.

92
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,785
No, I don't. What the [bleep]?

93
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,154
-Okay. So, my makeup...
-You're never doing nothing.

94
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,056
-Are you ready to see my makeup?
-Yeah.

95
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:56,195
So you get a box.
Then this is what my packaging comes in.

96
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,131
-[Jonathan] That's sick!
-[Kim] Gorgeous, right?

97
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,966
-It's like liquid.
-Liquid.

98
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:04,003
Then, inside is gonna be two sticks.

99
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,906
This color and this is my brush.

100
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,943
Isn't it, like, so pretty? So everything
is just gonna be really pretty nude.

101
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,846
-That's nice.
-Yeah. So that's my whole makeup.

102
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,183
How's Kylie feeling about you being
a makeup mogul as well?

103
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,253
Um, she's really,
like, so supportive of it.

104
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,221
-So cool.
-[Kim] So cool.

105
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:27,060
I have my makeup line that I'm launching,
KKW Beauty.

106
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:31,130
And it's so exciting
to do something on my own.

107
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,199
[Kim] I kind of like the darker bag.

108
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,336
-I just think it matches this the best.
-[woman] Mm-hmm.

109
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:40,273
If you want your single stick, that would
obviously have way more product.

110
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,908
It's only one color.

111
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,244
Basically, for the past almost decade,

112
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:49,515
my sisters and I have always
had a licensing deal.

113
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:54,587
[Kim] But going from being a licensee
to an owner is such a big deal,

114
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,522
and it's so much more responsibility.

115
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:00,560
I feel like this has been
what I've been working for for ten years.

116
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,262
-I love it. Congrats.
-Thanks.

117
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,999
-Exciting.
-Wait, can I post you wearing this jacket?

118
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:08,968
I don't want to.

119
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,472
You guys, Jonathan stole
my Good American jacket.

120
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,674
This is a guy's jacket. I [bleep] love it.

121
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:19,145
Well, now it is, but it wasn't.
So, Khlo, your first guys' customer.

122
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:23,049
{\an8}-See? I have flowers.
-You love flowers?

123
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,051
[man] You have an awesome face.

124
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,055
{\an8}[Khloé] Okay, so, basically,
let me tell you.

125
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,124
{\an8}Malika's dating this guy
who's a football player.

126
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,659
Malika met him with Khadijah.

127
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,997
She has only hung out with him in person
for five days.

128
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,866
-[Khadijah] Yes.
-[Khloé] Okay? And she's tell...

129
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,135
You know how Malika is.
She falls in love like that.

130
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,870
-[Khadijah] Immediately.
-Okay, talk [bleep]

131
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,138
while I'm sitting here.

132
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,673
We're not talking [bleep].
We're just saying the facts.

133
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,243
-That's what you call it.
-[Khloé] And so, whatever.

134
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,513
So he's like, "I don't know if I'm coming
on Friday anymore,

135
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,982
'cause I have a meeting
with my financial advisor."

136
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,519
And I'm, like, thinking you and I,
if we had a meeting with Lester,

137
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,587
-and you see Frenchie...
-We would cancel it.

138
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,524
He just said... He said, "I'm working
on trying to move it to tomorrow."

139
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,626
[Khloé] No, but it's not even working.

140
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:10,263
My point is, it's so easy to do that.
Whatever. What are you laughing at?

141
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:14,434
"The quality of your life
is the quality of your relationships."

142
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,536
-It's a Tony Robbins quote.
-Really? I like that.

143
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,938
[Khloé]
I was gonna say, what did you just google?

144
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,575
-You can thank me later.
-[Malika] I got it. I like that.

145
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:27,280
"The quality of your life
is the quality of your relationships."

146
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,149
Let's chant it together now, shall we?

147
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:35,688
[all] The quality of your life
is the quality of your relationships.

148
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:40,026
[all humming]

149
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,396
I've been reading a lot
of Tony Robbins' work lately.

150
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,297
Okay.

151
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,401
And I feel like he's really inspired me
to have a positive outlook on life.

152
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,236
[Khloé] You're not normally like this.

153
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,873
You're usually so negative
and have nothing positive to say.

154
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,409
It's just not cool that you copy me.

155
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,910
Because you're a [bleep] bitch.

156
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,280
I want you guys to know
this is a non-organic banana,

157
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:06,219
because it is [bleep] hard to open, A.

158
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,789
Ugh! [bleep] A.

159
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,960
[Khloé] For you to be going
from Negative Nancy to Positive Penny

160
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,094
is pretty strange.

161
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:20,399
I mean, I just prefer to give Malika
some positive encouragement.

162
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,735
It's not what you say.
It's how you say it.

163
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,070
Okay.

164
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,141
[Malika] Do you have any other,
like, positive reinforcement or quotes

165
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,644
you want to share with me?
I'm gonna need it.

166
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:36,048
Yes. "I have come to believe
that all my past failure and frustration

167
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,552
were actually laying the foundation
for the understandings

168
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,389
that I've created,
the new level of living I now enjoy."

169
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,590
[Malika] Amen.

170
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,026
I feel like all this applies to me
with Scott too, guys.

171
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,262
I'm making a change
and I want you to know.

172
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,732
-Right. All about change.
-Oh, cool.

173
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,500
[Malika] I'm receiving that for you.

174
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,036
[upbeat music]

175
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,573
What the [bleep] is wrong with you?
Take the [bleep] photo.

176
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,009
{\an8}I can't stop making it rain.

177
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,414
{\an8}-[Kendall] Can I have some rice and beans?
-[Khloé] Can you have some?

178
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,715
-[Kendall] Mm-hmm.
-[Khloé] Yeah.

179
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,785
[Khloé clears throat]
You're gonna like this.

180
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,953
[gasps]
No, I don't like hot.

181
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,922
-[Khloé] No, it's not gonna be that hot.
-[Kendall] I don't like spicy. At all.

182
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,758
Like, literally, the tiniest bit of spicy
is so uncomfortable.

183
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,694
-You're not your mother's daughter.
-No. I'm not, apparently.

184
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,564
-[Kourtney] Hi!
-[Khloé] Hi!

185
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,999
-[Kendall] Okay, I'm gonna leave.
-[Khloé] No, no.

186
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,834
-[Kourtney] Sit down.
-We never get to see you.

187
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,735
[Kourtney] Never.

188
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,237
[Khloé] You got to sit down with us.

189
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,873
-[Kris] Hi, guys.
-Hey, Mom.

190
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,342
-Hey.
-[Khloé] So, Mom.

191
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,812
I have been trying to find houses
for me and Tristan

192
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,416
to rent this summer, in the city,
and it has been...

193
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:47,019
'Cause he's gonna come here and yeah,
we have this house, but we want both.

194
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,189
He wants to, you know, hang out.
That's where he works out in the city.

195
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,124
[Kris] There's so many rentals right now.

196
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,927
-It's such a good time to go look.
-[Khloé] No, it's so hard.

197
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,063
That's why I want to help find the rental.

198
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,732
I want to help and just, like,
make things easier for him.

199
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,866
[Kris] I would love to do that.

200
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,369
[Kendall] In the city, there's a lot less
to rent than there is.

201
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,905
[Khloé] And, like,
they charge so much [bleep] money.

202
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,074
-[Kendall] Yeah.
-[Khloé] For anything decent.

203
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,377
I have been looking non-stop
for rental homes,

204
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,880
and time is running out.
I haven't found one thing.

205
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:20,453
I am so grateful for how Tristan
makes me so comfortable in Cleveland.

206
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,221
I just want the same for Tristan.

207
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,091
What's your price range? Look at this.

208
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,259
-Oh, my goodness.
-Filter.

209
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,964
[Khloé] Oh, my God! That's beautiful!
How'd you find this in two seconds?

210
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,966
-It has a gate. Like, a big gate.
-Ooh.

211
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,503
Kendall, you are, like,
a real estate agent.

212
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,840
[Khloé] I'm throwing
a Fourth of July party, you guys.

213
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,010
-I'm not gonna be in town.
-Yes, I'm not either. Where are you going?

214
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,313
-Where are you guys going?
-France.

215
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,783
-[Kendall] Why are you going?
-Kendall. Obviously, why is she going?

216
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,719
-[Kourtney] Just going to...
-To see her French croissant.

217
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,490
[upbeat music]

218
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,868
{\an8}-[Kris] Hi, honey.
-[Kim] What are you doing?

219
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,438
[Kris] Oh, just trying to keep up
with all my, um, emails.

220
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,007
[Kim] You're trying to keep up
with the Kardashians?

221
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,576
God, I'm trying. That purse is so good.

222
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,646
Thank you.
It's a Carole Bayer Sager vintage.

223
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,815
-[Kris] Stop.
-She gave me some, yeah.

224
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,517
So, what's going on, honey?

225
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:28,587
Nothing. I'm just, like, I was in the area
and then I have to go home and pack

226
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,522
for this whole...

227
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,026
New York trip with the Forbes conference,
and everything.

228
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:38,597
-So exciting. That's a big deal.
-Yeah. It is really exciting.

229
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:44,270
I am nervous, just because I've been,
like, slowly taking my time to come back.

230
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,271
[Kris] Yeah.

231
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,375
And so this is, like, a serious,
sit-down, major...

232
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,077
interview.

233
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:55,314
This isn't, you know, I don't know
how something like this could go.

234
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,216
Just if they want to ask me...

235
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,420
crazy questions. I mean, it's, like,
Steve Forbes, you know?

236
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,354
[Kris] Yeah.

237
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,091
[Kim] It's, like, hard for me
to get back out there.

238
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,763
The Forbes Women's Summit
is an amazing gathering

239
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,666
of all business people and entrepreneurs,

240
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,971
and I've been asked to do the main
speaking event with Mr. Steve Forbes.

241
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,007
[Kim] He's the editor-in-chief
of <i>Forbes</i> magazine,

242
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,745
one of the biggest
business magazines in the world.

243
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:29,181
I think there's a lot of pressure,
especially since everything that you say

244
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,551
can be taken out of context,
or just taken the wrong way,

245
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,588
so I want to be prepared
coming into this talk.

246
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,560
[upbeat music]

247
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,033
{\an8}[Kris] Are you just gonna bring
a suitcase with you now

248
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,269
wherever you go,
and you're not gonna let it go?

249
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,806
No. This was my suitcase from Anguilla.

250
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,642
-And you just got it?
-Oh, yeah, your luggage.

251
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,744
The boys left it in Cleveland,

252
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:04,650
so I basically went on a deserted island
with one thing, and then just...

253
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,185
You're like Gilligan?

254
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,655
-He had, like, one outfit.
-I think my island was a little better.

255
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,858
[Kourtney] You know, every problem
is the chance to do your best.

256
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,860
Oh, here comes Ms. Sunshine.

257
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,732
Little Miss Sunshine, they call me,
my part of Calabasas.

258
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,469
I'm just saying it was quite annoying
that we're on this trip with everyone,

259
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,539
and only my luggage gets left behind.

260
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:30,176
Life isn't about waiting
for the storm to pass.

261
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,078
-It's about learning to dance...
-It's about dancing in the rain.

262
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,215
No. Let me finish.
You don't know it. You don't know it.

263
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,118
-Sorry.
-It's about learning to dance in the rain.

264
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,287
[quirky music]

265
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,656
-Let her complain.
-Right.

266
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:47,693
Won't you, like, get on our bandwagon
here and help her complain?

267
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,363
This is getting it out. It feels good
to complain once in a while.

268
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,602
I feel like all Kourt does is go
from one extreme to another.

269
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,272
Where she used to go to was just
sitting in sorrow and that negativity,

270
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,541
and, yeah, I don't want her to go there,

271
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,978
but being this positive,
that's also a little crazy.

272
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,448
All right, guys. I've had enough
of this negativity for today.

273
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:14,653
Why would I sit here and just hear
complaint after complaint? So...

274
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,056
So where are you going?
Everyone around you complains.

275
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,860
[Kourtney] No. I'm gonna go surround
myself with positive vibes and love.

276
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,629
-[Khloé] Good for you, Kourt.
-[Kim] Good for you.

277
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,198
-Good for you.
-[Kris] Good on you.

278
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:30,870
What [bleep] positive pill did she take?
I think we all [bleep] need to take that.

279
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,272
[upbeat music]

280
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,548
I'm so excited to announce, you guys,
that I'm launching KKW Beauty.

281
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,619
[Kim] I really think you guys are gonna
love it. I've worked so hard on this.

282
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,188
So get ready to be contoured.

283
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,858
-Hi.
-Steve Forbes.

284
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,860
{\an8}-[Kim] So nice to meet you.
-Very nice to meet you.

285
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,562
{\an8}[Kim] I'm so excited to be doing this.

286
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,397
-Thank you for doing it.
-Yeah, of course.

287
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,499
[Forbes] And, uh, you have
a big announcement today?

288
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,869
Yeah, yeah, you know.
So I was, like, do I do it right before?

289
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,706
Don't I? Do I wait until tomorrow?
But I'm doing a talk show tomorrow,

290
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,610
so I figured, let's give it to Forbes
instead of the talk show.

291
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,680
-KKW Beauty?
-[Kim] Yes. I'm really excited.

292
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,418
I think that this Forbes Summit,
is, like, the perfect place to announce

293
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,953
that I'm launching a makeup line,

294
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,055
so I know it's gonna be so exciting,

295
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,357
and we've been trying to think
of how we're going to do it.

296
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,526
I just feel like I'm here
doing press in New York,

297
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,497
so there's no better time
than now to announce it.

298
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,667
[Forbes] What do you say to those
who downplay, or dismiss your success?

299
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,902
For people to always say crazy,
mean things,

300
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,038
I mean, it definitely does get to me,

301
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,107
but I think that
with the support of my family,

302
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,343
we've always kind of come through
on the other side.

303
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:49,748
I feel like my whole career has been
leading up to this year of these launches,

304
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,318
to where it's, like,
really authentically me.

305
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,120
So I just really want to focus
on what I'm doing now,

306
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:59,325
now that I feel like I've found my place,
and just continue to do that.

307
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,061
[Forbes] Thank you for, uh,
sharing your time with us.

308
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,263
-Uh, I think that people have a...
-[Kim] Of course.

309
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,366
...greater appreciation
of, uh, what you've done and are doing.

310
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,234
-Thank you so much.
-Aw, thank you so much.

311
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,571
[indistinct chatter]

312
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,006
[camera shutter clicking]

313
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,709
{\an8}Um, what would your advice be

314
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,445
{\an8}to somebody who's just starting out
in their own career?

315
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,813
I would say...

316
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,784
Just push forward and work really hard.
Like, there's...

317
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,419
You cannot deny hard work.

318
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,155
{\an8}Your mom... Wait a second.
Your mom's not the boss of this now?

319
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,557
-She's not.
-You're the boss.

320
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,325
Don't worry.
She still gets her ten percent.

321
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,361
[laughter]

322
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,597
{\an8}This year, I'm super excited that just...
I've gone from,

323
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,767
{\an8}you know, having licensing deals
to being owners of my companies.

324
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,236
{\an8}-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you for having me, seriously.

325
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,138
{\an8}It's a pleasure to have you.
Come back any time.

326
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,207
[upbeat music]

327
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,277
See you soon.

328
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,617
{\an8}-[Khloé] Hey, <i>madre.</i>
-[Kris] Hi, honey.

329
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,452
Ooh.

330
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,388
What are you doing?

331
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,925
[sighs]
Just stressed about the house.

332
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:11,096
Can you believe that people
show their house with an unmade bed?

333
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:16,301
This is, like, photographs
of their home with pictures

334
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,938
scotch-taped to the walls.

335
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,242
Honest to God. It's wild.

336
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,812
I made some appointments
to go look at some houses this Sunday.

337
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,816
Can you come with me to help me,
like, narrow this down?

338
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,185
-I can't.
-[Khloé] Why not?

339
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,188
I'm so... I'm swamped. And I have to work.

340
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,323
Yeah, but you told me
to book it on a Sunday.

341
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,494
-You said, "Any Sunday."
-[Kris] I know, but I can't this Sunday.

342
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,997
I could go by myself

343
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:50,402
and then give you a synopsis
of why I think the winner's the winner.

344
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,372
The winner is the winner.

345
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,640
[chuckles]

346
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,677
Khloé's not very happy with me right now,

347
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,748
because she thinks I'm turning her down
to go house-hunting with her.

348
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,049
But she just doesn't know

349
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:08,253
that I'm really helping Tristan
plan the surprise party for her.

350
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,692
Wait... you're planning, uh,
like, a surprise birthday, right?

351
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,261
-Yeah. We're gonna do it in LA, just...
-Okay.

352
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,931
Anything you need help with, just tell us.

353
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,265
She's upstairs.

354
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,868
It kills me when my kids are annoyed
or upset with me.

355
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,139
And Khloé's definitely annoyed.
I don't know what to do!

356
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,342
I can't tell her, but at the same time,
I don't want her mad at me.

357
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,377
I'm sorry, Khloé.

358
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,179
Mm-hmm.

359
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,249
How about something that's for sale?
Just call up the people and say,

360
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,051
"Can we live there for three months?"

361
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,121
I don't think when a house is on sale,
I could call and say,

362
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,224
"Hi, can I just stay in your house
for three months?"

363
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,759
Like, I don't think most people do that.

364
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,763
[upbeat music]

365
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,005
{\an8}[Kim] Oh, my gosh.

366
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,742
I'm seeing these photos
from the campaign, the ones that we took,

367
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,646
and people online are saying
that I'm doing blackface.

368
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,183
But I would never in a million years
be disrespectful and do that.

369
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,252
[tense music]

370
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:19,791
I did a photo shoot for my first launch
of my KKW Beauty Contour Sticks.

371
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:24,062
And we wanted them really moody.
I was really tan.

372
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,765
[Kim] I wanted to show the contour.

373
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:31,803
The photos ended up
being a little bit darker than I was.

374
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,140
And there were some people online
saying that I was doing blackface

375
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,075
and the photos were inappropriate.

376
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,015
[Kim] The Internet world is so toxic.

377
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,451
And I feel like people are just waiting
for you to make a mistake,

378
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,819
just to point it out.

379
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,722
What do you do? It's already out.

380
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,594
{\an8}[tense music]

381
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,031
{\an8}[Kim] You know what, I'll call Jen.

382
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,267
[line rings]

383
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,470
{\an8}<i>Hold on, can you hear me?</i>

384
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,440
-Yeah, I can hear you. Hello?
-<i>Hi, hi, sorry, I'm in the car.</i>

385
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:14,846
So I am seeing online that people
are thinking that I'm doing blackface.

386
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,150
I just think I have to address it,
'cause, like, if I don't,

387
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,652
then it'll turn into,
like, one of those situations

388
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,322
that people think I'm trying to ignore
something serious.

389
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,092
I just don't want it to turn
into this thing instead of the launch

390
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,361
and what we're working so hard to do.

391
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,464
<i>Yeah, I think take the pictures down.</i>

392
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,133
<i>And you want this to be all positive,
all about the product.</i>

393
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,069
<i>And we don't want to get off
on the wrong foot.</i>

394
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,738
<i>Then, we'll just have to explain
that that wasn't your intention.</i>

395
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:40,839
<i>We'll redo the images.</i>

396
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,476
<i>We'll make sure they're perfect and just
say that it was the lighting of the image</i>

397
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,644
<i>of the photo shoot.</i>

398
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,246
[Kim] Okay. Thank you so much.

399
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,515
Will you call the photographer
and just have them fix it?

400
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,752
-And then get the new images?
-<i>Yeah. I'm gonna call them right now.</i>

401
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,388
-Okay. Thank you so much.
-<i>You're welcome.</i>

402
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,456
-Okay, bye.
-<i>Bye.</i>

403
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,460
Like, it just sucks,
because it wasn't the intention.

404
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,228
I mean, I get it. I was super tan.

405
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,398
The lighting is really moody,
so I can get why people would say that.

406
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,468
I just don't want to give anyone
a reason to say something negative.

407
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,469
Yeah. For sure.

408
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,704
[dramatic music]

409
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:16,575
When you're, you know, running [bleep],
you just literally have to own up to it

410
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:21,847
and you have to change it and fix it
and not, like, hide and not understand.

411
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,650
{\an8}I fully understood
what people were saying.

412
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,618
{\an8}But I'm not gonna let this...

413
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,856
ruin all the hard work we put into it
and like, dwell on it.

414
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,692
Let's fix it. Let's move on. I would...

415
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,230
Everyone knows, I think, that I would
never, ever do a photo shoot like that

416
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,265
and I would never disrespect anyone.

417
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,468
I mean, I'm not gonna freak out. I just
want to make sure we, like, handle it.

418
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:48,106
Let's, like, get it over with. No time
to, like, freak out and make excuses.

419
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,309
-I feel bad, because...
-We just have to move on.

420
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,311
No, we'll have it handled. It'll be fine.

421
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,317
[upbeat music]

422
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:10,329
{\an8}[Khadijah] Um, excuse me, missy,
have you worn this yet?

423
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,663
No, someone just sent it.

424
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,765
-[humming]
-[Malika laughs]

425
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,100
[Malika] You look terrible.

426
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,903
[humming continues]

427
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,539
-You're a naughty little thing.
-Aren't you?

428
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,040
[Khadijah] Yay, Tristan.

429
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,745
Um, so now that you're back,
what's the plan when Tristan gets here?

430
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,915
Did he get a place?
Or is he gonna stay here?

431
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:33,552
Well, of course this is...
Like, his house is, like, my house.

432
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:37,289
His house is my house there, like...
but we wanted to get a house in the city.

433
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,827
I just have so much going on right now,
like, because the boys are now in town.

434
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:45,163
Trying to figure this out,
finding a house in the city. It's like...

435
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,866
-okay, I'm just a little...
-Those are your thoughts.

436
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:48,900
Don't stress yourself out

437
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,136
because this is all things
you are very capable of,

438
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,704
because you've done them 100 times.

439
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,806
[Khloé]
I just want everything to be perfect.

440
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:59,277
He makes me feel so special
and, like, everything's ours there.

441
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:03,515
-I want him to feel the same here.
-Khloé, that's what you specialize in.

442
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,717
-[Malika] He's gonna be happy to be here.
-It's just like a lot of anxiety.

443
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,252
[Malika] And it's all gonna pan out.

444
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,390
Because your thoughts go crazy
on things that are yet to come yet.

445
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:15,160
Just calm your thoughts,
so you can calm yourself.

446
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,295
-Yes, Mama Khadijah.
-Then you can enjoy it too.

447
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,065
No, let's just... I can't do this right now.
I really can't handle this conversation.

448
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,833
No, no, we've really got to stop.

449
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,902
[tense music]

450
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,776
{\an8}[Kim] Have you seen
what's going on downstairs?

451
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,843
[Laura] No. Is it amazing?

452
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,912
-I want to show you.
-[Laura] Oh, yeah? I can't wait.

453
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,914
-Should we run out real quick. Just see?
-[Laura] Yeah, let's run.

454
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,150
[upbeat music]

455
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,218
[Laura] Oh, my gosh.

456
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:44,055
So we carpeted the whole downstairs
since it was all stone.

457
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:44,956
[Laura] Wow, amazing.

458
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:48,894
So you're gonna be able to stand inside
and it's like this infinity thing,

459
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,063
-where, like, you see a million of you.
-[Laura] I love it.

460
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,667
The concept of my launch party
is I really wanted it in my home,

461
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,003
and I wanted to transform
my whole downstairs

462
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,739
into this, like, KKW Beauty,
like, showroom.

463
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,441
I wanted everyone to feel intimate.

464
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,610
Every room had to be, like,
an Instagrammable moment.

465
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,045
{\an8}Wow. Well, as a whole,

466
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,381
{\an8}-but it's, like, it's an experience.
-[Kim] Yeah.

467
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,083
Rachel? Can it just be the same color?

468
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,587
There's so much risk.
There's so much at stake,

469
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,657
and I'm in charge of every last detail.

470
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:22,727
[Kim] I really want it to be successful.
I really want it to do well.

471
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,697
This has been what I've been working for
for ten years.

472
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,567
[Kim] Even seeing downstairs,
like, I'm so nervous.

473
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,269
They're, like, down to the wire
of, like, finishing it up.

474
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,938
[hairstylist] It'll be done. Don't worry.

475
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,174
But just to even know that,
like, all these people are coming over

476
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,777
just for something that I worked on,

477
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:43,882
and after ten years
of, like, hustling in the game...

478
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,220
This whole entire launch
is, basically, on my shoulders.

479
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,288
-[hairstylist] It's finally here.
-It's finally here.

Mario, is the white dress better
than the brown?

482
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:57,929
[Mario] Yeah, I think so.

483
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,533
I love seeing everything come together.

484
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,003
I have an amazing launch party
that I have planned for tonight,

485
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,072
and I'm so excited to meet everyone.

486
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:12,477
[Kim] We are now in the KKW Showroom.
Look at how cool!

487
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,880
-[Stephanie] Can I let people in?
-[Kim] Yeah.

488
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,084
[Kim] Hi, guys! How are you? Of course.

489
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,952
-Thank you, guys, for coming.
-I'm so excited to check it out.

490
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,121
-[Kim] Oh, my god, thank you. Thank you.
-You look beautiful, of course.

491
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,358
Hi! I love the orange.

492
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,261
{\an8}I'm wearing my Kylie and Kendall dress.

493
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,662
{\an8}-Stop.
-[laughs]

494
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,064
[Kim] Hi, guys. I just wanted to say hi.

495
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,267
{\an8}-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much for coming.

496
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,302
{\an8}-Patrick. Nice to meet you.
-[Kim] Nice to meet you.

497
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,639
{\an8}-[Kandee] You look so beautiful!
-Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

498
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,040
{\an8}-This is amazing!
-Thank you!

499
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,609
The packaging is beautiful.
The product is beautiful.

500
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,412
And I feel like people,
when they think of contouring,

501
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,081
-they just think of you, like...
-[Kim] Oh, thank you.

502
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,250
Hey, guys!

503
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,587
We're gonna swatch an exclusive...
It's shimmer.

504
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,323
[Patrick] Oh, that is so good!

505
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,394
My first swatch test that I've done
on someone here at the party.

506
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,730
I'm getting to meet so many
of the beauty bloggers and YouTubers

507
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:09,301
that I've never met before.
This is, like, a whole new world for me.

508
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:13,138
{\an8}So I'm so excited that I'm just
having so much fun doing it

509
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,940
{\an8}and meeting all of these amazing people.

510
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,475
{\an8}[camera shutter clicking]

511
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,145
{\an8}[Kim] How do you decide
what looks you're going to do?

512
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,913
I was looking at the KKW picture.

513
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,082
I was like, okay,
you look bronzy and glowy as [bleep],

514
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,519
so let me try to do something like
a little less obnoxious tonight.

515
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,189
-So cool. Yeah.
-Those pictures are so [bleep] good.

516
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,692
-Thank you. Thank you.
-You just look so good.

517
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,827
It all, like, came together so fast.

518
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,697
I mean, it looks so bomb. I'm definitely...
I'm filming with this tomorrow.

519
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,732
[Kim] Oh, thank you.

520
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,534
-[Charles] Should we do a selfie?
-[Kim] Yeah.

521
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,137
We should do it in the rose room.
Have you seen the rose room? Okay.

522
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:50,642
It's such an amazing feeling
just seeing it all come to life.

523
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:54,412
-Me and Mario. How good is this room?
-This is amazing.

524
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,481
You guys, this is, like, the OG crew.

525
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,784
{\an8}We're here at Kim K's launch for makeup.
It's the best thing I've ever tried.

526
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,819
{\an8}[laughs]

527
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,755
We worked so hard on this.
It seemed like such a rush,

528
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,591
and I was, like, in such a panic
to make everything perfect.

529
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:11,029
Kanye saw the plans,
and it was so helpful, his input.

530
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,631
He called our florist,

531
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,867
and we made that whole
flower rose room last-minute.

532
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,737
And that was honestly,
like, the biggest attraction.

533
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,139
What the [bleep] is this?

534
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,807
[man] Oh, my God!

535

[Malika]
This is magical. A flower ceiling?

536
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,945
Everyone so far is loving it.

537
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,848
There's such amazing press
on this launch party,

538
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:33,051
and I'm so happy that we made
so many changes so it would be perfect.

00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,821

-Babe, I love you. I'm so proud of you.
-Thank you.

-Are you good with the way it turned out?
-I'm so excited. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

544

Well, good! It's been a long time coming
for you to do something with makeup.

-I'm excited. It is.
-I'm proud of you, baby. I love you, too.

-It's a success. She's eating!
-Love you.

-Oh, okay. Damn.

{\an8}Do you want me
to hang this stuff up in here

598
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:40,104
and put them in... like on hangers so we can
transfer them to the other closet,

599
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,173
or do you not know
if you want to keep this stuff?

600

but my stuff can stay folded.</i>

Bye.

603
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,718
After talking with Tristan, we have come
to the conclusion that I'm crazy.

604
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,187
I don't know why
I was stressing myself out,

605
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,857
when we have our beautiful home
in Calabasas.

606
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,593
All Tristan really wants is to be with me,

607
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,529
and just for us to be able to enjoy
our summer together.

608
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,030
That's really all that matters.

609

-So, Kourt.
-[Kourtney] Yep?

610
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:12,437
This closet's obviously overwhelmed,
so I'm taking stuff out of that closet

611
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,806
and moving it to that bedroom.

612
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:19,577
-Where's his stuff gonna be?
-In the main bathroom. Like over there.

613
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,413
But I'm moving some stuff out
and putting it in this guest thing.

614
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,716
How annoying would that be
if he came in here to get ready.

615
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,784
No, but just...
he's a guy and we're all girls in here.

616

his shlong around everywhere, you know.

00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,502
Is this yours?

633
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,404
-No. That's all you.
-Yours.

634
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,873
I would go insane if I drank this.

635
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,508
[Scott] You went insane a long time ago.

636
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:29,547
That girl tried to come to Khloé's party,
like, six times she was asking people.

637
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,051
And I was like, it's a firm no, actually.
[chuckles]

638
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,687
[bleep] I didn't even get invited
to her birthday.

639
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,789
-[Kourtney] Exactly.
-[Scott] And I'm family.

640
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,558
That was really sweet.
That made me feel really good.

641
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,262
I didn't... I-I don't do,
like, a family roll call, so...

642
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,665
No, I mean, there's only one person
that would have gotten me not invited,

643
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,568
and that would be Kourtney.
I highly doubt that Khloé was like,

644
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,404
"The last person I'd want
at my surprise party would be Scott."

645
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,109
It's cool. Honestly, I called my sister,
and I hung out with her the whole night.

646
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,410
And then I actually called my mom after,

647
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,912
like, "Hey, Mom, do you want to come over?

648
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,313
'Cause I'm feeling a little down
and lonely

649
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,183
'cause the family that claims I'm still
blood, even though we're not together,

650
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,951
still doesn't invite me
to a surprise party,

651
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,686
but I really felt good about it."

652
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:13,124
The pity party is why you would think
that you would act differently.

653
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,193
Okay, and acting differently meaning?

654
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,495
There's things that you just should know.

655
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:21,065
I don't know because you don't discuss
with me or communicate.

656
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,801
I can understand you
not inviting me to your birthday.

657
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,737
But your sister, who I've known forever,

658
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,339
longer than anybody else who was there
outside of the family.

659
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:32,176
Like, I would have wanted to be there
for her. I don't get it. Be honest.

660
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:37,181
Hm, I didn't want to have you
coming to the birthday

661
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,584
and be photographed going in,
and just like...

662
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,453
Photographed going in is your concern?

663
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,622
[tense music]

664
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,225
My concern would be there
to be there for your sister,

665
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,660
who I love and care about
for the past 10 to 12 years

666
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,896
and been there for through thick and thin,
and marriages

667
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,798
and all these different things.

668
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,167
I'm a little bit caught off guard,

669
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,070
and I just said that I didn't want
to be photographed,

670
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,607
even though that's really not
what I meant. I just tried to be positive,

671
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,710
and I didn't want to say, like,
"I just didn't want you there."

672
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,313
So if I can't say anything nice,
I just won't say anything at all.

673
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,481
[Scott] That's all [bleep].

674
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,485
It's funny to realize
how fake you really are, though.

675
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,357
[upbeat music]

676
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:27,231
{\an8}-[Khloé] Hi, princess. Can I have a huggy?
-[Penelope] Hi, KoKo.

677
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,170
[Khloé groans]

678
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,538
Hi.

679
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,006
-[Khloé] How are you?
-Good.

680
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,809
[Khloé] You're good? I love these pants.

681
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,446
Look at Mommy's body.
Doesn't she look so gorgeous?

682
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,414
Not without makeup, though, right?

683
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,349
-That's what she tells me.
-No.

684
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,087
What? Mommy looks pretty without makeup.

685
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,288
[Kourtney] Am I doing stairs?

686
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,323
-[trainer] Elliptical, first.
-Okay.

687
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,727
[trainer] Five minutes.

688
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,730
So yesterday, Scott came over

689
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,767
and brought up the birthday.

690
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,802
But like, I just didn't have the words,

691
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:09,640
and I feel like when I talk to him
in person, sometimes I just smile.

692
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,944
[Kourtney] So I was just smiling,
like, couldn't really get the words out.

693
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,246
And I think that makes him more mad.

694
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,516
[Khloé] My question is, did you tell him,
like, what did you say?

695
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,385
Like, do you think he understands that...

696
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:25,189
there's going to be a transitional period,

697
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,626
that now he can't be invited
to every family event

698
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,761
if it doesn't have to do with the kids?

699
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,663
Yeah. I think so.

700
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,267
-Maybe I need to repeat that.
-[trainer] And break.

701
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:41,405
Listen, I love being positive,
I love Positive Penny, I do.

702
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:46,811
[Khloé] But I don't think it's wrong
if you have the conversation with him.

703
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,646
[Kourtney]
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

704
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,181
[Khloé] Sometimes you're so positive,

705
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,251
and we're all
an incredibly forgiving family.

706
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,685
We just sometimes need to be, like,

707
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,754
still I could forgive you
and have you in my life.

708
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,856
We just got to set boundaries.

709
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,591
[Kourtney] Yeah, like, I need to...

710
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:04,595
Whether I'm, like, positive or upset,
or whatever it is, it's, like,

711
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:09,133
just get my emotions out, instead of just
being, like, numb to everything.

712
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:12,870
I held back in my conversation with Scott

713
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,706
because I was trying to keep
my positive ways.

714
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:19,177
But sometimes it feels good to have,
like, real emotions.

715
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:22,180
And I think it's just time to be honest.

716
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:26,417
I feel like you're gonna be
on that TV show <i>Snapped</i> one day.

717
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,621
Because you're bottling up all this stuff
that's, like, the truth.

718
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,056
-[Khloé] You're just like...
-[laughs]

719
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,991
What the [bleep]? Why are you laughing?

720
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,527
I just have a major problem in life.

721
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,296
Laughing 'cause you're uncomfortable?

722
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,630
[Kourtney laughs]

723
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,866
[upbeat music]

724
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,443
{\an8}Hey, Khlo. Look at these flowers.

725
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,112
-[Scott] This is insane.
-I have some upstairs.

726
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,282
-They're for everywhere. It's beautiful.
-Don't you like to disperse?

727
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,618
-Yes, they are all dispersed.
-And I added these...

728
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,687
[Scott] You have a lot of people
that love you, Khlo.

729
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,455
I do, and I've never...

730
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,258
This is, like, the first year
I've ever had all of this. It's so nice.

731
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,961
Why do you have
all this condensation around?

732
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,798
The air wasn't working, it's now working.
Maybe that's why.

733
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,367
Maybe it was warmer in these things,
and now it's cooling off.

734
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,702
And I like it cold!

735
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:21,305
And I have flowers that I like
to keep cool, so they last longer.

736
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,007
Should we take it over there?

737
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,676
I don't even...
This has nothing to do with me.

738
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,046
[Kourtney]
Nothing like a good old-fashioned chat.

739
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,584
So I was recapping Khloé this morning
in our workout...

740
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:36,053
-[Scott] Okay.
-...about what we talked about last night.

741
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,458
And we thought that our lives
are changing,

742
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,561
and, like, there's times
when I want you to come.

743
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,396
Like, and there's times that I don't.

744
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,732
[tense music]

745
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,202
I just sometimes want to be able to go

746
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,770
-do social things.
-[Scott] And you can.

747
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,905
Every single day of your whole
entire life, every day.

748
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,607
[Kourtney]
But those are big events for me.

749
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,776
[Scott] Yeah,
but they're also big events for me.

750
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,614
You act as if, like,
I wasn't there for this family.

751
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:06,017
[dramatic music]

752
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,290
{\an8}I just feel like you love
that you are able to hold this over me,

753
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,025
and that's like your control factor.

754
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:17,795
And I feel like you think you can go out
and do whatever you want,

755
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:21,198
and purposely try to hurt me
and still get invited to everything.

756
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,833
What does that mean, though,
at the end of the day?

757
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,502
What do you think that really means?

758
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:25,736
That means I hate you,

759
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,140
or does that mean that I actually love you
and I do things out of spite?

760
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,941
[Kourtney]
That's not a way to show your love.

761
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,944
-[Scott] No!
-When someone's trying to [bleep] with me,

762
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,548
I'm not into having them
at my sister's party.

763
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,185
I don't think that I do the right thing.
I know that.

764
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,654
But for something like this,
this is not exactly...

765
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:47,658
But when you intentionally are trying
to hurt me and be, like, tit for tat,

766
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:49,293
that doesn't make me want to be, like,

767
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,762
"Let's invite Scott to the party.
I want to hang out with him."

768
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,132
But again,
it wasn't about you in this instance.

769
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,301
If it was your birthday, I get it.

770
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,671
I am on the longest Ferris wheel
of all time.

771
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:04,008
Like, we got to get off the ride
at some point and get on a new one.

772
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,211
Like, it's the same old story
over and over and over again.

773
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,746
[Scott] Okay, so, let's be honest.

774
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:13,351
I mean, obviously, I'm not able to handle
everything that well.

775
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,219
I don't have the best support team.

776
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,054
I'd like to try
to [bleep] be a better person,

777
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,757
but it's not the simplest thing.

778
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,027
You already know the things
that you should be doing in life.

779
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,297
You don't need me to tell you them.
We're not gonna sit here

780
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,468
and go over it again for the 100th time
in ten years or more.

781
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,536
[dramatic music]

782
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,773
I am proud of Kourt
for expressing herself.

783
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,910
But I just need this
to go further than just this room.

784
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,713
I feel like, okay,
this is the good first step.

785
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,749
[Khloé]
And I just really hope she sticks with it.

786
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,952
You really don't know
what you should be doing?

787
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,287
You're gonna tell me that?

788
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,289
You're one of the smartest people
I've met.

789
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,791
Aw, you want to make out?

790
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:58,462
Seriously, you guys
are so [bleep] dysfunctional,

791
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,233
and I don't know if this is, like,
something you guys do as foreplay,

792
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,834
but this is [bleep] nuts.

793
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,204
When do you think we're gonna get married,
by the way? Like, 40? I mean...

794
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,240
You think that when I turn 40,

795
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,376
I'm gonna go, "Hey,
I've been looking for this drunk guy,

796
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:18,816
and he has a bunch of dirty [bleep]
stained underwear, whores..."

797
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,217
[laughs]

798
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,720
-You two are so [bleep] nuts, seriously...
-Let's get out of here.

799
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,188
...and the fact that you waste my time

800
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,557
when you guys are now
just gonna go get mani-pedis together.

801
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,159
-[Kourtney] No!
-Look at this.

802
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,895
{\an8}-I'm not going... We don't hook up.
-I love you guys.

803
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:33,631
{\an8}[Khloé] You guys are getting
manicure-pedicures together?

804
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,733
-No. I'm going to get my nails done.
-[Scott] We're gonna hook up.

805
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,002
[Kourtney]
He's going to hang out with the kids.

806
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,972
You guys are [bleep] sick.

807
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,475
{\an8}[Khloé] <i>On the next episode...</i>

808
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,311
{\an8}This is Madhvi. She is my scribe.

809
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,246
{\an8}What the [bleep] can't you remember,

810
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,916
{\an8}where you need this person
jotting everything down?

811
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,220
{\an8}If you look up all these streets,
there's tons of tents.

812
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,723
{\an8}The homeless issue is a full epidemic.

813
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,028
{\an8}This is the worst manmade disaster
in the United States.

814
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,063
{\an8}[Kim] It's just, like, heartbreaking.

815
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,599
{\an8}I just want to figure out
what I can do to help.
