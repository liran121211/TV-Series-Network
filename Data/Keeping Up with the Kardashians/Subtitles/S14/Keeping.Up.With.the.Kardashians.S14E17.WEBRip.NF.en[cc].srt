-[Khloé] What is all that?
-[Kris] Jackfruit.

00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,249
-Okay, just taste... taste it.
-Like, I bite into it?

00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,952
Yeah. There's a... a seed inside.

Oh, it's good.

My jackfruit just had a baby.

Oh! It's like an embryo came out.

11
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,233
-[Kris] I know. It's like a uterus.
-[Khloé] Ew!

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,334
"Hi, Khloé."

13
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,436
-That is so nasty.
-"What are you doing?"

14
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,605
Thank God I didn't chew down
to the middle.

15
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,106
[Khloé] I would've freaked out.

16
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,509
How come you're not looking at me?

17
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,345
There's a lot of weird things
going over there.

00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:46,980

{\an8}-Hello. Hi.
-I missed you.

23
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,879
{\an8}-How are you?
-Good.

24
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,182
{\an8}What's going on?
I've been waiting for days.

25
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,751
-I'm ten minutes late.
-How was the...

-[Kris] Oh, my God.
-European...

00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:30,090
You definitely belong
on Tommy Hilfiger's boat. Beautiful.

How many feet?

29
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,359
A lot. Hundreds.
[laughs]

30
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,063
[Kris] So, where were you,
my little world traveler?

31
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,866
-I haven't been anywhere crazy.
-[Kris] No?

32
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,469
-My passport got stolen recently.
-Stop.

So it kind of slowed me down a bit.

34
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,840
Kourtney probably took it away from you.

00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,609
-No, a stripper did. But I'm...
-[both laugh]

36
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,712
[Scott] You know,
Kris really is like my mom,

37
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,582
so for me,
it's a lot of fun to hang out with her.

38
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,252
Probably more fun to hang out with her
than anybody in the family at this point.

39
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,553
[laughs]

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,288
Should we do, like, a spa day?

41
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,690
Yes.

42
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,326
What else can we do,
like, outside of the ordinary,

43
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,061
just to, like, still do things together?

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,996
[Scott] We could start walking
in the neighborhood.

45
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:10,897
I would love to walk.

46
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:15,401
Also, I like the idea
of taking the kids to the San Diego Zoo.

47
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,704
It's also to see your mom is nice,
or is she here now?

48
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,673
The goal is to transition
up here permanently,

49
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,909
but I think it's gonna take her a minute,
you know?

50
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,978
{\an8}-She misses her friends, I'm sure.
-[Scott] I get that.

51
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,414
{\an8}Did she ever date anybody
after Papa Harry?

52
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,616
{\an8}-[Kris] Yeah, no.
-Not really?

53
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,384
She was heartbroken.

54
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,418
[Kris] Isn't that funny?

55
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,220
Did you consider Harry like your dad?

56
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,722
Yeah. Called him "Dad."

57
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,690
-And you met him at how old?
-[Kris] Ten.

58
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,559
[Scott]
And your dad died when you were ten?

59
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,660
16.

60
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,565
I know that Kris is quite interesting now,

61
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,269
but I never really knew
exactly how she grew up.

62
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,303
What about your dad?

63
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,672
He left town when I was very young.

64
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,007
-Okay.
-And he went back

65
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,509
to Ohio to work.

66
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,777
He was an engineer.

67
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,980
I want to know more
about Kris's, like, upbringing.

68
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,850
-Papa Harry taught me how to drive.
-[Scott] No way.

69
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,086
He had a car just like Kendall's Corvette.

70
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,721
-He was killing it.
-[Kris] Yeah.

71
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,924
When my parents were out of town,

72
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,359
I stole the car
and took it for a little joyride.

73
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,161
-[Scott] Why not?
-And I got caught.

74
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,462
By the cops?

75
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,831
[Kris] Well, we lived across the street
from my grandmother.

76
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,233
When I came back home,

77
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,570
I saw my grandmother and my grandfather
outside watering the lawn,

78
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,272
-and I just drove by and waved.
-[Scott] How old were you?

79
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,373
[Kris] 15.

80
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,710
Right. That's about the time
you start stealing your parents' cars.

81
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,680
[Khloé] Hello. That's me...

-What?
-[Khloé] Malika.

91
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,073
Her and I have been feuding.

92
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,109
We were supposed to leave
Friday morning for Cabo,

93
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,912
but she never told me
she had a job on Friday.

94
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:06,813
Yeah.

95
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,948
[Khloé] I didn't know she was working.
We're supposed to leave.

96
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,585
She was like, "If anyone knows me,
knows I do not like to drive."

97
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,120
She was like, "If you were a real friend,

98
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,756
you would've offered to wait
till I was off work."

99
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,591
And then I was like, "Listen,
I'm going through a lot right now.

100
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,860
I don't have time to stress
about this type of stuff."

101
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,429
She said,
"Your personal situation seems real.

102
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,731
I would handle that."

103
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:25,698
[Kourtney] Oh, my God.

104
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,201
It's been, like, the last year.

105
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,203
I really think
she has an issue with Tristan.

106
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,339
Not Tristan, particularly,
she's jealous <i>of</i> Tristan.

107
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,476
I don't really live in LA
that much anymore,

108
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,211
and I'm newly pregnant.

109
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,714
I feel like I've really been trying
to juggle the best I can.

110
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,984
I just feel like she's picking a fight
for no reason.

111
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,186
She's my friend since I've been 15,

112
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,989
but like, she didn't seem
very friendly to me that day.

113
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,558
But I'm just like,
"Just get over yourself."

114
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,160

[Kris] Maybe you and I
could really benefit from this treatment.

at the end of the day.

-[Kris] Hey, guys.

with psoriasis forever.

It is so frustrating.

124

So you're putting it on the affected area

125
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,362
and then pressing the button?

126
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,634
I've kind of given up on treatments
just because nothing has really worked,

127
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,070
so I'm just so excited.

She's... Doesn't feel well,

and she's not quite sure what it is.

[Kris] Kendall struggles from anxiety,

151
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,459
and I think she has so much going on
that she gets herself really worked up.

[Kris] Kendall, don't cry.

154
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,566
It's so weird
'cause I get, like, super lightheaded.

170
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,812
<i>I was basically asking her
to just wait for me.</i>

171
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:29,816
<i>My feelings were hurt because I felt like
had it been Tristan or one of the guys,</i>

172
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:30,983
<i>she'd have waited.</i>

173
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,622
For Khloé and Malika to not be speaking,
I know that it must be serious.

174
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,493
So I just want to really understand
what's going on.

175
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,830
Khloé's going through
such an important time in her life,

176
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,866
and I know that she would love
the support of her best friend.

177
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,436
[Malika] <i>Don't get me wrong,
I love Tristan, I love Sab, I love Simon.</i>

178
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,439
<i>But Khloé and I
used to always do something.</i>

179
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,908
<i>She and I, or the girls, or whatever,</i>

180
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,212
<i>but Khloé doesn't do anything
without Tristan.</i>

181
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,949
I feel like once I was in, like,
a more serious relationship

182
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,684
and had kids and stuff like that,

183
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,788
I just, like, I wasn't as close
with my friends for, like, years.

184
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:13,359
And then I started having new friends,
like my mom friends and stuff, and then...

185
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,795
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-Now... And then when Scott and I broke up,

186
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,398
I got, like, much closer
to my original friends.

187
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,667
<i>And it's okay. I mean, things change.</i>

188
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,604
I mean, I think you guys should talk.
I don't know.

189
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:30,076
<i>Um... I don't... I don't know exactly.</i>

190
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,979
<i>I don't know, it's just...
It's, it's an awkward thing.</i>

191
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:33,880
[Kourtney] Yeah.

192
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,449
I don't know.
I just feel like Khloé has a lot going on

193
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:40,019
that maybe if you reach out, like,
if you've... if you're up to it

194
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,754
and just see what's going on.

195
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,491
<i>No, Kourtney, I know.</i>

196
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,662
<i>It's obviously been easier
for both of us to just avoid.</i>

-[Kim] Come on, Mase, chant it with us.

[Scott]
Oh, this is a straight wilderness hike.

205
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,620
[Khloé] I'm so tired. Whew.

206
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,857
-[Mason] How is this a lookout?
-[Khloé] 'Cause you look out.

207
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,528
I was asking about, you know,
your mom's real dad,

208
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,630
which would be
your biological grandfather.

209
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,333
-I know nothing about him.
-[Scott] Right. He was, like, an engineer.

210
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,068
-He worked on planes.
-He was?

211
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,770
Yeah. It's, like, pretty cool stuff. Yeah.

212
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,238
[Khloé] But why doesn't Mom talk about it?

213
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,839
I thought he was, like,
a scumbag or something.

214
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,874
[Scott] No, he wasn't.

215
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,777
It's very interesting, all these
little bits and pieces that I've learned,

216
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,712
which is weird that you don't know.

217
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,081
-[Khloé] That's very true.
-To tell the next generation.

218
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,117
My mom is not here anymore,
so it's difficult.

219
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,754
But if she was, I would obviously
want to know every single thing.

220
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,757
And there's definitely times that I want
to ask her questions, but I can't.

221
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,126
[Scott] That's why
I kind of feel passionate about the girls

222
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,962
knowing their mom now while they can.

223
00:09:56,028 --> 00:10:00,232
Why didn't you guys ever ask your mom,
like, about your real grandfather?

224
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:03,502
[Khloé] I didn't know
that my mom had a different dad...

225
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,204
-I got ya.
-...until later in my life.

226
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,807
'Cause when you're, like, eight,
why are they gonna tell you that?

227
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,543
She's not gonna say, like, "Oh, my dad
passed away when I was younger,

228
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,512
and this guy that you know as my dad
is really my stepdad."

229
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,983
Yeah, but my dad died
when my kids were, like... and mom...

230
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,951
-Like, I'm gonna tell them, no?
-[Kim] Yeah.

231
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,421
Kylie literally... I said,
"Silver Range Rovers are my thing, guys."

232
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,957
So, she just texts me and goes,
"So, I got a silver Range Rover

233
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,659
and I made the top silver like yours

234
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,361
and I put the same wheels on it
like yours,

235
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,996
but don't freak out when you see it."

236
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,531
Well, black cars are my thing,
and if anyone...

237
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,534
-By the way, all cars are my thing!
-...picked any black car...

238
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,037
I did have velvet cars first.

239
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,773
-Yeah, I'm not trying to get a velvet car.
-Oh, no one wants that?

240
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,008
Okay, got it. Got it.

{\an8}I'm so happy my bed's gonna be bigger
than this one day.

244
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,490
Look at how much more space I have
for, like, so many friends.

245
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,025
You could put, like, six girls in there.

246
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,193
-I know. It would be amazing.
-[Kris chuckles]

247
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,997
So, what are we gonna do?
Did you go to the doctor?

248
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,198
Yeah.

249
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,768
She took my blood,
and I thought I was anemic.

250
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,770
I think you think you have everything.

251
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:15,107
There's a lot that happened this past year
that's, like, affected my, like...

252
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,575
Starting with, like...

253
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,345
-Kim?
-[Kendall] Kim's robbery.

254
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,446
[Kris] Yeah.

255
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,348
And then, like, not even,
like, physical things,

256
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,816
like, I think... Well, then I got robbed.

257
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,184
Then I had my stalkers.

258
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,119
[Kendall] That's why I don't really like
going out anymore.

259
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,754
That's why I don't tweet,
that's why I don't Instagram

260
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,223
because then, like,
just that gives me anxiety too.

261
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,526
I swear, it's the craziest thing.

262
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,495
Well, I know you get anxious
when you're on the road,

263
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:40,966
and you're out there at a Fashion Week
for a month at all these different cities.

264
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:46,839
And I think what I want to know is,
what's the solution for the next time?

265
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,175
[tense music]

266
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,144
Because I worry about you
and I know you want to do a great job,

267
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,814
so I want to be able to help you

268
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,083
to get to a place

269
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:01,454
where you can be out there
and not feel anxious.

270
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,556
I know. I don't know what it is.

271
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:09,028
I don't think any of us have taken
the time to process what's been happening,

272
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,531
maybe over the past, like, year,
almost two years even.

273
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,768
[Kendall] And I think
that that is a factor in a lot of this.

274
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,905
It's hard to just to get your brain
to, like, slow down and think about it

275
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,607
and really process what's been happening.

276
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:26,045
So, I think now that I sit here
and I can verbally say that,

277
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,115
I think that that will help me
with the steps to take the time

278
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,783
and really address it.

[Thalia] So, you can just take a seat.

286
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,742
The way the sound works is,

287
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,912
each bowl is attuned
to a different energy center of your body.

288
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,415
They're all notes on a melodic scale,
and they correlate with your chakras,

289
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:07,086
so depending on any issues
that you're going through

290
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,121
or dealing with or want support in,

291
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,891
I can play
more of a certain sound or another.

[Kendall] It's basically just my head.

[Thalia] Mm-hmm.

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,396
I, like, feel distant
and out of it all the time,

295
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,964
and, like, my anxiety's just crazy.

296
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,566
-That's kind of it.
-[Thalia] Okay.

297

Those are, like, my main things.

298
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,504
I haven't really stuck to meditation,

299
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,506
but it has helped in the past, for sure.

300
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:32,778
And now I think I need
to really dive into it way deeper.

301
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,750
So recently, I've been doing
sound baths and acupuncture

302
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,719
and just trying kind of everything I can
and seeing what works for me.

I've always been a hypochondriac.

I remember I would, like, eat oatmeal

and, like, if I put too much sugar
in my oatmeal,

310
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,493
I'd run to my parents and be like,
"I put so much sugar. Am I gonna die?"

I've always been the worst hypochondriac.

-[Kris] Why? What happened?

330
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,011
-What happened?
-I just feel like your kids

331
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,413
just don't know anything
about how you grew up.

332
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,981
I don't, really...

333
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,083
Nobody really cared to ask me

334
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,451
-about my story.
-[Scott] I care.

335
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,619
Your story's unreal.

336
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,221
I mean, look at what you've become.

337
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,756
[Scott] You're the most interesting woman
in the world.

338
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,557
-[Kris] Right.
-Can we do a legacy video?

339
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,793
[tense music]

340
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,195
-You want to do a legacy video?
-[Scott] Yeah.

341
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,230
[Kris] What?

342
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,699
We have to. It would be epic.

343
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,836
Two years ago, the girls set up
doing a legacy video on MJ.

344
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,506
Do you have any favorite sayings
or quotes that you live by?

345
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,807
[MJ] "Always try harder."

346
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,042
"Do your best."

347
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,810
How many people have you slept with?

348
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,911
Four.

349
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,780
-Four total?
-[MJ] No.

350
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,415
-Four that I remember.
-[Kendall] Remember, yeah.

351
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,883
[laughing]

352
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,987
Kris is obviously the matriarch
of this huge, strong family.

353
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,590
And the truth is, I would think
that everybody would be interested

354
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,060
in how she became the woman she is today.

355
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,594
We should get testimonials.

356
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,196
Can you get some old-school celebs?

357
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,864
-Old-school celebs?
-[Scott] Yeah.

358
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,033
Like, it'd be cool, you know what I mean?
They're like,

359
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,103
"That Kris Jenner
is one fine piece of ace."

360
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,006
All the guys that I dated are dead.

361
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,407
All right.

362
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,542
We start work Monday, kid.

363
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,510
Oh, my God. It's a deal.

364
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,746
[light music]

365
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,485
{\an8}[Sushi barks]

366
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,455
{\an8}[Kendall] Why does she do that?
It, like, prances.

367
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,656
-Sushi.
-[barks]

368
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,057
You should shave this part of your arm.

369
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,026
I laser, and, you know, laser,

370
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,328
if you don't have hair
in a certain spot, like, originally,

371
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,331
and you get it lasered, sometimes,
the hair grows back, like, thick.

372
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,767
And you never even had thick hair there.

373
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:46,505
Can you heat up my wax machine to medium?

374
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,509
So I found this girl who, like,
is, like, a sound therapist,

375
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,478
and she, like, creates sounds around you

376
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,014
with, like, bowls and, like, chimes
and all this stuff.

377
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,083
It was really nice. Put me to sleep.
But it was really nice.

378
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,551
[Kim] So, you're not going to Paris?

379
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,986
[Kendall] I don't think so.

380
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,990
I wasn't gonna do Milan, and then
my agents were like, "You should do Milan

381
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,593
and then if you don't wanna do
one of them, just don't do Paris."

382
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,862
-[Kim] What about Mom?
-[Kendall] Mom's coming in with me.

383
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,965
But, like, I just want to, like...

384
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,201
be more low-key.

385
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,370
'Cause, like,
Mom would stress you out more.

386
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,873
Yeah. I literally told her,
I was gonna go by myself,

387
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,109
and then I literally told her yesterday,
I was like, "I need space."

388
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,444
Yeah.

389
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:29,148
[Kim] I think that my mom always wants
to help, but Kendall's an adult,

390
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:34,119
and she just has to, like, figure out
how to handle it on her own.

391
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,224
[Kim] I am so excited to wax now.

392
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,461
-You have no idea.
-[Kendall] I don't... I... I laser.

393
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,763
And I get laser again tomorrow,
so should I just wait?

394
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,765
-Yeah, you can't do it if you're lasering.
-Yeah.

395
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,567
-Well, that's what I've been saying.
-Ah.

396
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,469
I really was looking forward to this.

397
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,304
Stephanie, do you have anything
you want me to wax?

398
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,573
-[Stephanie] Uh...
-Do you need an upper lip wax?

399
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,474
Do you need...

400
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,776
-[Stephanie] Yeah, do you want to do it?
-Yeah.

401
00:17:58,844 --> 00:17:59,945
Should I trust her?

402
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,113
-[Kendall] Yeah.
-Let me see.

403
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,749
Didn't you go to, like, cosmetology school
or whatever it's called?

404
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,920
[Kim] When I was 14,
my dad got me makeup lessons.

405
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,421
That is not cosmetology school.

406
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,724
That was, like, one lesson with a guy
videotaping doing my makeup.

407
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,493
-[Kendall] Oh.
-Which I really want to find.

408
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,262
I know. I would do anything to find that.

409
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,734
{\an8}-Don't put it up my nose.
-[Kim] No, it's good up there.

410
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,004
-You don't want little nose hairs.
-[Kendall] Okay.

411
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,207
-[Kendall chuckles]
-What, Kendall?

412
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,842
Yeah, I think this was a bad idea.

413
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,777
{\an8}-[Stephanie] Mm, Kendall, don't say that!
-[Kim] Wait.

414
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,580
-[Kim] One, two.
-[shrieks]

415
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,514
Okay.

416
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,349
-[Kim] Wait, wait.
-She's bleeding.

417
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,718
It's a dot, you guys. Relax.

418
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,288
[upbeat music]

419
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,092
Ooh.

420
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,564
Malika recently has texted me
and said she wants to talk.

421
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,602
[Khloé] We haven't really spoken
since our last fight.

422
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:57,903
I'm totally down to talk.

423
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,939
I just hope we actually get
to the bottom of our issues.

424
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,442
Well, I appreciate you coming over.

425
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,610
[Malika] Of course.

426
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,514
Because I think we both, like, have maybe
miscommunication as to what happened.

427
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,581
-[Khloé] I think...
-I agree.

428
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,683
Definitely, you feel your way,
and I feel my way,

429
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,620
and I think we just need to talk about it.
You're not big on communication.

430
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,054
-I'm not.
-[Khloé] I am.

431
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,055
[Malika] Yeah.

432
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,792
Like, I wasn't aware
that you wanted me to wait for you

433
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,263
till after you guys were done working,
which I would have no problem doing.

434
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,166
[Khloé] I just was like, you know,
"Simon and Sabbaz are meeting us down..."

435
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,268
Like, everyone was just driving down
on their own.

436
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,937
I, of course, would have waited,

437
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,642
but I didn't know that was, like,
what kind of, like, the whole problem was.

438
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,145
I think where the miscommunication came in

439
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,449
was because you're with the guys
all the time,

440
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,520
so your communication with them
is even stronger than it is with me.

441
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:52,357
I think your perception
is that I'm always with the boys.

442
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,726
I genuinely don't see the boys that much.

443
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,196
[Khloé] The boys, yeah,
they're Tristan's best friends,

444
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,132
and I'm friends with them,
of course I love them.

445
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,700
You know, like, when they're here,

446
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,569
they're normally doing a few things,
then they bounce.

447
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,337
Like... and I'm normally at work.

448
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,576
Either way, it just, to me, it's so...

449
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,110
Not that your feelings are petty.

450
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,913
This whole thing's a little petty.
Like, this is why we're not talking.

451
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,282
Yeah, it's petty
'cause we just didn't talk about it.

452
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,650
-Totally.
-[Mallika] Because...

453
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,086
I became frustrated, you become frustrated

454
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,522
because ultimately, we didn't end up

455
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,958
doing something
that we planned on doing together.

456
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,195
It doesn't matter.
It's here and it's gone, but...

457
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:34,132
I feel like there's also something else
that's bothering you,

458
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,400
and I don't know what that is.

459
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,107
We don't spend a lot
of "Malika and Khloé" time.

460
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:47,379
We spend a lot
of "Malika, Khloé, and the guy" time.

461
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,947
I do love the boys.

462
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,216
I do have a great relationship
with them, but I don't...

463
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,085
It's not our relationship, and I don't...

464
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,654
It's not, but I think sometimes,

465
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,890
the people that you spend
the majority of your time with

466
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,860
become priority
'cause they're right in front of you.

467
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,730
And I just don't want to feel like I...

468
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,298
I don't want to come secondary.

469
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,466
If I want to talk to you,

470
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,768
I maybe don't want to talk to you
in front of all the guys.

471
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,536
-Mm-hmm.
-[Malika] Or... you know what I'm saying?

472
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,439
And it is a bit of a strain.

473
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,575
[somber music]

474
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,211
I don't want to blame you
because you moved.

475
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,613
That's so childish, but I think it's hard.

476
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,984
Like, you and I, we went from seeing
each other how many days a week,

477
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,987
to, like, seeing each other
every other month.

478
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,257
I want to be around you
and spend time with you, but, like...

479
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,492
Why don't you just say that?

480
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,597
[in soft voice]
I'm gonna...

481
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,067
Don't cry.

482
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,904
You don't have to cry.

483
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,572
-You always cry.
-[Malika] I love you.

484
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,542
[Khloé] I love you.

485
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,679
Regardless if I agree
with everything she's saying,

486
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,482
her feelings are her feelings,
and I'm never gonna invalidate them,

487
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,118
so if Malika feels like I'm not good

488
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,988
at giving her
that individual one-on-one time,

489
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,558
I have to be more aware of that,
and I need to make a better effort.

490
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,795
I do try to communicate with you
when I'm there.

491
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,530
I will try harder.

492
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,900
Well, just call me and talk to me
and tell me you stubbed your toe.

493
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,502
Tell me you tripped down the stairs
'cause you're clumsy.

494
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,137
Just talk to me.

495
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,940
[Khloé] You know what?
Life does get in the way,

496
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,442
and I don't think that's a bad thing.

497
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,111
I think we all have to be secure
with our role in each other's lives

498
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,647
and just be okay with that.

499
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,416
So can we get to the important things now?

500
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:32,884
What's important?

501
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,087
-You have a boyfriend?
-[Malika] Yeah.

502
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,823
-You're gonna smack me.
-[Khloé] Oh, no.

503
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,524
This is why I really missed you though.

504
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,960
This 18 days has felt like a year.

505
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,362
Crazy.

506
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,530
[upbeat music]

507
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,415
[Kris] This is cute.

508
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,183
What size is this one you have?

509
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,519
{\an8}[indistinct chatter]

510
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,155
-12 months.
-[Kris] 12?

511
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,257
It's okay from 6 to 12 months.

512
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:16,361
This I want, and this I want.

513
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,397
Is this size too big?

514
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,664
No, I like that size.

515
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,868
[Kris] It's hard for me
to watch my daughter struggle,

516
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:26,104
and I feel like it's my job
to make sure she's okay,

517
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:30,475
which is really why I am here in Milan,

518
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,511
but I realized Kendall

519
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:36,415
is one of the most independent women
I've ever met in my life,

520
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,851
and she can get to the root of the issue

521
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,087
and the problem by herself.

522
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,890
So I'm gonna relax and enjoy myself.

523
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,027
I need to get out of here
before I get into more trouble.

524
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,395
[Kris laughs]

525
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,963
-[Kris] Thank you.
-[man] I agree.

526
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,865
All right, come on down.

[Khloé] <i>I hope they taste good.</i>

528

{\an8}Can I show you
these DASH sweatshirts for approval?

529
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:05,510
[Kourtney] Here's one.

530
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,814
-I just don't like that design.
-Hate it.

531
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,317
I don't like this design,
but I like the sweatshirt itself.

532
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,585
Barf.

533
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,087
-What is this?
-And here's this. So I like this the best.

534
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,023
[Khloé] That's better.
That's more like Guess.

535
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,158
-Yeah, and it's more like Fila.
-Or Express.

536
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,593
[Khloé] Yeah, that's the one.

537
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,161
[both] Yeah!

538
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,431
And then should we do gray just with gray,
and then white with white?

539
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,501
-Tone on tone.
-Tone on tone.

540
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,902
Okay.

541
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,471
[Kourtney] Taking care of that, boss.

542
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,007
So the guy and Malika...

543
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,642
[Khloé] Okay, I just love this girl.

544
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,344
She still talks to that guy?

545
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,714
No. So the guy, you know,
took her to the Bahamas,

546
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,584
and then he went silent, like disappeared.

547
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,487
So then she was like, "I want to text him
and be like, 'What happened?'"

548
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,655
She texts him,
"I've wanted to talk to you.

549
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,525
I like you. I thought you liked me.
I don't really know what happened.

550
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,427
{\an8}And I'd really appreciate it
if you would share

551
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,896
{\an8}your honest point of view with me."

552
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,765
-Where is this girl? Yeah.
-[Khloé] Malika?

553
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,302

{\an8}-[Malika] <i>Hello?</i>
-Hey. I'm with Kourt.

00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,508
{\an8}<i>Hi, Kourt.</i>

556
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,643
{\an8}Hi. I just think you need to...

557
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,412
I mean, you already sent that text.
Was that just now?

558
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:15,747
<i>Yeah.</i>

559
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:20,252
Okay, so moving forward, let's not
really communicate with him anymore.

560
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,654
<i>Yeah, that's what I feel like. I...</i>

561
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:27,158
I just feel like, do you know the power
of ignoring and what it does to people?

562
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,093
[scoffs]

563
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,462
The power that you will hold inside of you

564
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,199
will make you so horny
that you'll literally...

565
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,134
Like, I don't even know what you'll do.

566
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,069
<i>It hurts my feelings, like...</i>

567
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,039
<i>And I just don't want to keep putting
myself up against someone</i>

568
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,141
<i>that is obviously showing me
he doesn't care.</i>

569
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,510
<i>I'm not the girl you hit
when you're [bleep] bored.</i>

570
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,078
'Cause he's keeping tabs on you,

571
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,648
so when he wants to [bleep] you,
you're still available.

572
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,883
{\an8}[Khloé] But we have to hold ourselves
in higher regard

573
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,920
{\an8}so we don't allow people
to treat us certain ways.

574
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,454
{\an8}<i>I totally agree.</i>

575
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,958
It obviously devastates me
when Malika's upset.

576
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:00,926
It makes me upset,

577
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,995
and I don't want her to keep
going through the same vicious cycle.

578
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,632
And I love Malika so much
for being this hopeless romantic

579
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,367
and for just falling in love with love,

580
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,869
but it's just... when she gets hurt,

581
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,270
she really gets hurt.

to be in the situation I'm in,

You know,
I'm not a huge fan of working hard,

Let me get Kris.

611
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,499
You know, obviously, I'm doing this video
because I'm interested

612
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,100
and because I want Kris to have this,

613
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,669
but I'm also doing it because I think

614
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,404
that the girls
would really enjoy it as well.

615

for you.

When and where were you born?

619
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,984
I was born in San Diego, California.

620
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,720
November 5th, 1955.

621
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,556
A very long time ago.

622
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,092
-[laughs]
-What were you like as a kid?

623
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,563
[Kris] One of my childhood memories
is being at my grandmother's house.

624
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:24,569
That was such an amazing time in my life
because it was such a family time.

625
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:28,440
It was always my grandparents
and my mom and my biological father.

626
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:34,079
And we had so much fun, and it was sort of
the idyllic, warm-and-fuzzy childhood.

627
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,615
But my parents got divorced
when I was seven.

628
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,050
How was that?

629
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,752
That was really sad.

630
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,955
Not a lot of people know too much
about your biological father.

631
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,392
Okay, my biological dad,
his name was Robert Houghton.

632
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,228
He moved to the Midwest
because he was an engineer,

633
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:54,365
and he worked at places like Boeing and...

634
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:55,500
-Boeing jets?
-[Kris] Yes.

635
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,901
So he did that for many years.

636
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,137
And his work took him out of the city
from time to time.

637
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,572
[Scott] Wow, that's pretty cool.

638
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:04,175
[Kris] And then he moved back to San Diego
when I was a teenager.

639
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,779
And then how much longer was he involved
in your life until he passed away?

640
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,848
[pensive music]

641
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,383
-I guess, like, four years.
-[Scott] Wow, that's not that much.

642
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:18,256
Four years later, he and his girlfriend
at the time went to Mexico.

643
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,091
[Kris] He was killed in a car accident.

644

-She was with him in the car?
-[Kris] Mm-hmm.

-[Kris] Uh-huh.

-Well, that's interesting too.
-Yeah.

647

-I just thought he was by himself.
-No.

-I didn't know that.
-Yeah, they were together in the car.

just to have any relation or...

00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,174
-I have no idea.
-[Scott] Okay.

{\an8}So when Bob died... did I have any contact
with his girlfriend?

658
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,661
<i>Yeah.</i>

659
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,364
<i>Yeah, you went to the hospital,</i>

660
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,432
<i>and she told you what happened</i>

661
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,135
-<i>at the accident in Mexico.</i>
-[Kris] Uh-huh.

662
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,705
<i>The vehicle that knocked them
off the road just kept going.</i>

663
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,041
-<i>It was, like, a semi...</i>
-[Kris] Uh-huh.

664
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,776
<i>...and it just went rolling through a field.</i>

665
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:12,710
Mm.

666
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:17,749
<i>And, um, the nuns got him out of the field</i>

667
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,484
<i>'cause there was a nunnery nearby.</i>

668
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,219
[somber music]

669
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,188
-[Kris] Okay. All right.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

670
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,256
-Bye, Mom.
-<i>Bye.</i>

671
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,129
You know, obviously,
when something like that... traumatic,

672
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,430
happens in your life

673
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,568
and you lose a parent,
that things are a little foggy.

674
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,574
Losing my dad
was one of the most significant things

675
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,576
that's ever happened in our lives.

676
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,714
You know, you don't have that father...

677
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,684
We had our stepdad as our father figure.

678
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,585
[Scott] Right.

679
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:57,322
Who we loved so much,
and he, you know, raised us.

680
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,793
Um, do you remember your first crush?

681
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,794
[Kris] I do.

682
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,130
-I think I was, like, maybe 15.
-[Scott] Hmm.

683
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:12,337
Do you remember the actual, real,
like, first love of your life?

684
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:15,974
I think the first love of my life
was when I met Robert Kardashian.

685
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,308
-[Scott] Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

686
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:23,681
My mother had this tradition
of going to the Del Mar racetrack,

687
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,050
and that's where I met Robert Kardashian.

688
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,519
I couldn't bet,
because I wasn't old enough,

689
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,588
so I stood off to the side

690
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,258
while everybody I was with
was placing their bets.

691
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:37,795
Robert came up to me and asked me out.

692
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,899
[Kris] And then eventually, he said,

693
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:44,669
"The day that you get out
of flight attendant school and graduate

694
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,806
and move to New York is the same day
O.J. and I are coming to New York

695
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:53,011
because O.J.'s doing commentary
at the Olympics.

696
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:57,916
And I'm really excited to go up there
and watch this young kid, Bruce Jenner,

697
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,717
try and win the decathlon."

698
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,221
-Robert said this?
-[Kris] Yeah.

699
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,956
He was at the Olympic Games...

700
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,425
-Yes. That's right.
-...that Bruce won?

701
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,228
That is a very cool story.

702
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,399
What are the most important lessons
you've learned in your life?

703
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:18,503
To appreciate the people
that you love while they're here.

704
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,972
-[Scott] Okay.
-Because you never know

705
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,810
when suddenly, you might not have somebody
that means so much to you.

706
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:30,581
There's definitely a couple things
that have come up

707
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,183
that the girls have never told me about,

708
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,918
that I've never even
heard them talk about,

709
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,754
and if somebody were to come to me

710
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:41,159
and give me a video of my parent
telling their whole life story,

711
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,994
I would be greatly appreciative.

712
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,930
So I hope the girls like it
as much as I would've liked it.

713
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:50,935
The fact that you had the interest
to even sit down

714
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,504
and talk to me about
what my past was like,

715
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:57,575
or what I was like when I was younger,
is really sweet.

716
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,545
-Yeah, I mean, I find it interesting.
-And I appreciate you caring about me.

717
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,913
-And I want...
-[Kris] Thank you.

718
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,514
...my kids to know all these things.

719
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,084
[Scott] It was a pleasure
sitting down with you.

720
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,252
Oh, it's my pleasure.
Thank you for having me.

721
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,688
[upbeat music]

722
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,961
{\an8}[Malika] I had my, like,
your body-chemistry test

723
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,262
{\an8}that I did, like, last year,

724
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,164
and then I did it again this year.

725
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,066
[Khloé]
You're definitely skinnier than I am.

726
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,701
[Malika] But I need my fat.

727
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,237
Like, I need it or I have no shape at all.

728
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,006
[Khloé] Better keep eating.

729
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:33,011
I'm really glad that Malika and I
got all that crap out of the way,

730
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,546
and I thought we would just have
a good time together.

731
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:40,151
So Malika and I met a matchmaker,
someone who's an expert in this field,

732
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,619
that knows what they're doing.

733
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,322
We definitely like to dig in
a little more and see,

734
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,425
{\an8}you know, what is it
that you genuinely are looking for.

735
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,460
How do we know that this will work for me?

736
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,361
We don't know.

737
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,963
[Khloé] How do we know
any of your relationships

738
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,898
-are gonna work for you? We don't know.
-[Malika] I know.

739
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,166
Let's just try it out.

740
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,534
Taste some appetizers.

741
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:02,173
Okay, so here we go with all the...
with all the great...

742
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,910
Is he a model?
[chuckles]

743
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,278
[Raj] He is 26 years old.

744
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,980
His birth sign is an Aries.

745
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,681
He recently became a vegan.

746
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,718
Oh, my God, I'm pescatarian. Cute.

747
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,621
And then we have Tavares.

748
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,189
[Raj] He's 35 years old.

749
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,591
He served six and a half years
in the military.

750
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,528
He has a degree
in business management and marketing.

751
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,896
-Oh, okay.
-[Raj] Yes.

752
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,732
And then we have Chris Roy.

753
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,801
Is Chris in a club?

754
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,536
[quirky music]

755
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,470
[Malika] Amazing.

756
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:37,308
One of my other favorites, this is Kobie,

757
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,178
also known as Gatsby Randolph
on social media.

758
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,612
[Raj] He has a very,
very big following.

759
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,081
He is the, the modern day Renaissance man.

760
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,250
He's an entrepreneur,
former nightclub owner.

761
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,685
He's a published author.

762
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,788
He looks a lot chubbier
on his social media.

763
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,057
So, I have to pick one?

764
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,827
You can pick all of them.
[chuckles]

765
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,929
[both] Okay.

766
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:01,666
Well, why don't we marinate on it,
and let Raj know tomorrow?

767
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,067
-[Raj] Yeah.
-[Malika] Okay.

768
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,702
-Thanks.
-All right, sounds good. Absolutely.

769
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,572
-This is pretty interesting. Okay.
-[Khloé] We'll stay here, Malik.

770
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,607
-[Raj] Talk to you guys soon. Bye.
-Bye.

771
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,845
How are you feeling?
Like, what's your gut?

772
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,780
My gut's, like, nervous.

773
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:19,150
And this is making me think
I'm way pickier than I thought I was.

774
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,187
[Khloé] I could tell
this isn't gonna work out for Malika.

775
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,823
She's my best friend. I've known her
since I've been 15 years old.

776
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,658
I know her very well,

777
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,827
but, you know, with everything
that's been going on,

778
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,096
I'm just happy
that we're able to laugh about this

779
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,631
and be on the same page with this.

780
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,701
And I mean, this is just what we do.

781
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,636
You break up to make up.

782
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,706
Well, nothing worth having comes easy.

783
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,476
-I know. I know.
-Like those cookies you just ate.

784
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,078
I'm just so fat.

785
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,980
[both laughing]

786
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,682
[upbeat music]

787
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,322
{\an8}[Kris] When you guys recycle,

788
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:03,227
{\an8}do you put plastic in here,
or glass, or plastic and glass?

789
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,529
[Khloé] Plastic and glass.

790
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,533
[Kris] Oh, so plastic and glass. And?

791
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,700
[Khloé] And aluminum.

792
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,269
And aluminum.

793
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,839
You just don't put food
and, like, perishables.

794
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,309
[Khloé] That's probably
the only thing you can't recycle.

795
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,378
Get in here.

796
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,680
-You're gonna get recycled.
-[Scott] Hello, hello.

797
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,448
-Hey!
-Hi!

798
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,683
Mwah.

799
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,585
-[Scott] How you doing? Hi.
-How are you?

800
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,054
I come bearing gifts today, by the way.

801
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,556
Wait, what kind of gifts?

802
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,890
I have the legacy video

803
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,025
-that I made of you.
-[Kris] Stop.

804
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,294
-Yeah, I'd always find it interesting.
-Wait, is this what we did with Grandma?

805
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,729
-[Scott] It's very similar but about her.
-[Kris] Yeah.

806
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,631
I'm always asking you
if you guys know, like,

807
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,700
-the relationship...
-Is it about her camel toe too?

808
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:43,834
-Do I have a camel toe?
-No.

809
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,703
It's too big to fit
in this one a little DVD.

810
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,338
-[squeals]
-[Kris] Do I have a camel toe?

811
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,673
-[Scott] Anyhoo...
-Can I have mine?

812
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,974
Oh, we each get one?

813
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,110
Yeah, listen, we're rich out here.
Enough to go around.

814
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,079
-[Kim] Oh, this is so cute.
-Look at the picture.

815
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,547
[Khloé] That looks like Kourtney!

816
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,183
"Kris Jenner was born
Kristen Mary Houghton

817
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,118
on November 5th, 1995

818
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:04,689
to proud parents Mary Jo Shannon
and Robert Houghton."

819
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,390
All right, let's go watch this.

820
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,826
[light upbeat music]

821
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,762
I think that as our parents get older,

822
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,832
you want to know more about
what your mom or your dad

823
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,102
might've gone through when they were
the same age that you are.

824
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,839
I'm really excited for my kids
to see my legacy video

825
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,675
because they'll have that forever,

826
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,645
and who knows,
maybe they learn a thing or two

827
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,580
about their mom
that they didn't know before.

828
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,849
[Kim]
My psoriasis is getting a bit better.

829
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,084
Oh, my God. Good.

830
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,253
[Khloé] Oh, my God!

831
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,687
-Wait, turn it up.
-Stop.

832
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,155
You did interviews?

833
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,457
Of course.

834
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:43,127
<i>The most dramatic thing
that my kids don't know about me</i>

835
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,597
<i>is I had a bone tumor in my left leg.</i>

836
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,633
-[Khloé] You did?
-[Kim] I knew that.

837
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,001
I did not know that.

838
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,335
<i>They were gonna do a test on it</i>

839
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,738
<i>while they had my leg open,
and if it came back</i>

840
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:58,242
<i>positive for any cancer,
they would have to amputate my leg.</i>

841
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,577
-[Khloé] That's horrible.
-<i>And I think that's something</i>

842
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,746
<i>that really affected my mom and I.</i>

843
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:05,850
<i>And then, in the spring of 1973,
I was 17 years old.</i>

844
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,885
-<i>I actually had a boyfriend...</i>
-Of course you did.

845
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,321
<i>...who was always out of town.
His name was Caesar.</i>

846
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:15,793
<i>So while he was living on the road,
I met Robert Kardashian.</i>

847
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,862
Ooh! Hussy.

848
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,398
<i>Robert came over one day
when Caesar was out of town.</i>

849
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,566
[Khloé] What? Mom!

850
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,036
-Were you hooking up with him?
-Yeah.

851
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:28,139
Oh, my God! You're such a whore.

852
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,107
Now we know where we get it from.

853
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,443
[Kris on video]
<i>And then we went back to Caesar's house,</i>

854
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:37,615
<i>and lo and behold,
Caesar came home to surprise me.</i>

855
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,483
-<i>So...</i>
-[Scott on video] <i>And? What happened?</i>

856
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,252
[Kris] <i>Well, it wasn't pretty.</i>

857
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,120
-[Scott] <i>Did they get into a fistfight?</i>
-[Kris] <i>I'm not proud of it.</i>

858
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,456
<i>Actually, Caesar tried
to grab his sweater.</i>

859
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:46,724
<i>I think he ripped a hole</i>

860
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,025
-<i>in Robert's sweater.</i>
-[Khloé gasps]

861
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,728
<i>I didn't want to ever hurt
anybody's feelings.</i>

862
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,031
"I just wanted some dick
while Caesar was out of town."

863
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,933
[laughter]

864
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,471
Oh, my God. I cannot believe
Scott made this legacy video.

865
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,907
-I think it's so sweet.
-And so sweet.

866
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:08,179
So much I think we think we know
about Mom, but we really don't.

867
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,747
[Khloé] This is my mom's time to shine.

868
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:13,517
I think all she ever wants
is to feel like all the attention's on her

869
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,454
and that, like, we really are listening
and care about her as her children.

870
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,189
So it's cute to see her that excited.

871
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,690
Yeah, she was really excited.

872
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,863
<i>What do you hope
for your kids and your grandkids?</i>

873
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,935
[Kris]
<i>I hope that they understand and appreciate</i>

874
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,572
<i>the value of having
this big, huge enormous family.</i>

875
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,208
[soft music]

876
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:41,078
<i>And that they all stick together
and figure out</i>

877
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,749
<i>how to go through life together
and to support each other.</i>

878
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,617
-[Scott] <i>Very, very nice.</i>
-[Kris] <i>Yeah.</i>

879
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,986
-[Khloé] Yay!
-[all clapping]

880
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,788
-Whoo!
-[Kris] What do you think?

881
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:57,428
I do think it's super...
just smart of Scott.

882
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,363
'Cause even that made me think about Dad.

883
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,732
Like, man, I wish we did this with Dad
and just had it.

884
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,667
-Yeah.
-So in, like, 20 years, like...

885
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,203
In 20 years, we might forget
half the stuff about Mom

886
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,172
-and watch it and just, you know...
-Yeah.

887
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,407
...remember all over again.

888
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:13,177
Thank you so much
for taking the time to do that for me,

889
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,846
so my kids will have it
and learn a little something about me.

890
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,682
It was a lot more time
than that comes out to, by the way.

891
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,717
It looks easy.

892
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,185
I was out there hours.

893
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,587
But the lighting. I got to work on...

894
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,089
Scott, work on your lighting.

895
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,324
I know. It was the first time
I was in production.

896
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,326
No, but in general, you're a sloucher.

897
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,962
{\an8}[Kim] You should've just taped it up
behind your neck.

898
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,497
{\an8}-[Khloé gasps]
-[Khloé and Scott] What?

899
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,466
-Oh, my God.
-[Scott] You can do that?

900
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,867
[Khloé] Tape your neck?

901
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,102
[Kris] Ouch.

902
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,470
{\an8}[Kim] <i>On the next episode...</i>

903
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,705
{\an8}[Kourtney] So, I've been thinking
about freezing my eggs.

904
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,374
{\an8}Are you serious? You want another kid?

905
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,376
{\an8}I should just do it
so I don't have to think.

906
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,279
{\an8}Is this why I want to have kids?
It's, like, putting too much pressure.

907
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,513
{\an8}My name is Miranda.

908
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,548
{\an8}My name is Miranda.

909
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,082
{\an8}My name is Miranda.

910
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,551
{\an8}What the [bleep] is going on here?

911
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,518
{\an8}[laughs]

912
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,754
{\an8}[Kim]
TMZ just got a tip that you're pregnant.

913
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:00,090
{\an8}It's just really unfortunate for Khloé
'cause she's not ready to talk about it.

914
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,725
{\an8}You want to tell people yourself.

915
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,495
{\an8}It's just, like, people take all of that
away from you.
