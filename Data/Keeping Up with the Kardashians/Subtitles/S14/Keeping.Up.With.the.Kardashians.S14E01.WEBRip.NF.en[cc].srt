00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,474
{\an8}-We're all going to Cleveland!
-[Malika] <i>Show us your city, baby.</i>

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,742
{\an8}[Khloé] <i>Oh, yeah!</i>

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,677
{\an8}-[Kim] <i>Queen of Cleveland!</i>
-[Khloé] <i>Kim K!</i>

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,813
{\an8}-Hey, guys, I brought a friend.
<i>-Best day of my life.</i>

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,682
{\an8}-[screams]
-[Khloé] Yeah!

6
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:16,683
{\an8}[laughs]

7
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,222
{\an8}-[somber music playing]
<i>-I'm always the last to know anything!</i>

8
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,356
{\an8}[Kim] "In Caitlyn's book,

9
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:26,226
{\an8}Robert Kardashian
knew O.J. Simpson was guilty,

10
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,161
{\an8}but joined the defense team to get back

11
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,196
{\an8}-at his remarried ex."
-[Khloé] What?

12
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,298
{\an8}Caitlyn is a liar.

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,567
{\an8}I don't even know what to do.

14
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:38,671
{\an8}I think the only thing you can really do
is just be, like, real and honest

15
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,273
{\an8}because you can't ignore it.

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,142
{\an8}-Like, you can't.
-Yeah.

17
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,846
{\an8}-[man 1] Camera speed.
-[Kim] Ready?

18
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,415
{\an8}-[Khloé] It's [bleep] hot in here.
-[Kim] Yeah.

19
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,184
Who knew my under-boobs
could perspire this much?

20
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,319
-Yeah.
-Hello, little friends.

21
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,221
Okay, so...

22
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:58,191
It's been ten years of our show,
so we're doing a photo shoot

23
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,727
with <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> 
just to celebrate.

24
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,395
[photographer] There you go.
Perfect. All right.

25
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,296
[chuckles]

26
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,799
It almost seems like it's been, like,
a hundred years, but then...

27
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,868
Yeah, I was gonna say.
I feel like I'm such a different person.

28
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,338
Like, my voice was so much different
and I was like, "This is Kim."

29
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,340
No, way dumber.

30
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:18,478
You're like, "I'm so excited,
we're doing <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>.

31
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,913
My sisters are not on the cover.

32
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,147
It's just me."

33
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,916
-I would not.
-"They have a little, like,

34
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:23,917
side thing in the back."

35
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,653
I was, like, more bubbly, like, "Hey."

36
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,523
-No, aren't I doing it completely right?
-Really?

37
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,925
[Khloé chuckles]

38
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,793
-[photographer] All right, we're ready.
-[woman 1] Yeah!

39
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,263
[upbeat music]

40
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,533
All right, a little more serious. Yes.
Beautiful.

41
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,437
Kendall and Kourtney, a little closer.

42
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,674
-There you go, perfect. Yeah.
-[music fades]

43
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,376
Hi, guys.
We're gonna play Fishing for Answers.

44
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,813
"Which Kardashian or Jenner
hosts the best parties?"

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,115
-Ooh!
-I...

46
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,249
-Oh.
-[Kendall] Oh.

47
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,818
-I think myself.
-[Khloé] I knew you were gonna say that.

48
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,854
-My parties are so fun.
-What?

49
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,923
Anyway, "Most extreme rumor
you've heard about your family."

50
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,360
Ooh! All of us here
have slept with Scott Disick.

51
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,728
[laughs]

52
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,997
-And it is true.
-We came here today to confirm it.

53
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,366
We came to tell you, guys,
at <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>

54
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,602
that we are boning Scott Disick.

55
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,904
[both laughing]

56
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,473
[theme music]

57
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,395
{\an8}[phone rings]

58
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,165
{\an8}-[Tristan] <i>Yes, babe.</i>
-[Khloé] What are you doing?

59
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,566
[Tristan] <i>I'm just waking up now,
but I'm still coming by,</i>

60
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,034
<i>so I'm going to shower,</i>

61
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,637
{\an8}<i>-and I'm going to come over.</i>
-[Khloé] Okay. Take your time.

62
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,539
{\an8}I'm about to get started
with my first interview

63
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,074
{\an8}and then, you know, so on and so forth.

64
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,745
{\an8}[Tristan] <i>Okay. Okay. Good. Do you want me
to bring anything or are you good?</i>

65
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,748
-No, I'm good, baby.
-[Tristan] <i>Okay. You look good, girl.</i>

66
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,183
Thanks, baby.

67
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,884
-[Khloé] Love you. Thank you.
-[Tristan] <i>Love you, too.</i>

68
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,952
Bye-bye.

69
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,858
For the past eight months,
I have been basically bi-coastal.

70
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,061
Like, whenever Tristan's on the road,
I go back to LA and I work,

71
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,865
and whenever he's in Cleveland,
I try to be there and it is grueling.

72
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,201
[woman 2] Are we all good? We set?

73
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,702
-[man 2] We're good.
-[woman 2] All right.

74
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,437
We're ready, Aaron.

75
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,606
[Khloé] But I like being in Cleveland.

76
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,310
It's a much simpler life
and I actually love it and I crave it.

77
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,879
[Khloé] It's doing things
like cooking and cleaning.

78
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,581
[Khloé on recording]
<i>He is pretty hot cutting meat.</i>

79
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,683
I go to a lot of basketball games.

80
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,353
It's a very, like, mild life.

81
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,322
Like, you need the balance of both.

82
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,257
-I think it's a healthy balance.
-Mm-hm.

83
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,492
[woman 2] That's a wrap on Khloé.
Thank you, everybody.

84
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,264
[Tristan] Damn!

85
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,499
Khloé, you look good, real good.

86
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,073
-Hi, guys!
-Hi.

87
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,709
[Malika] Aww. Toronto.

88
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,010
You're just my favorite.

89
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,945
{\an8}-[Malika] You just know that, okay?
-Are you guys drunk?

90
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,880
{\an8}-I appreciate that, guys.
-[Malika] No!

91
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,515
No... No wine yet?

92
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,184
No, I want to.

93
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,319
So, guys, I need a trip to Cleveland.

94
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,155
It's like you got a whole other world
over there that I'm not a part of.

95
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,223
Not feeling good about it.

96
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,691
[Khloé] Well, Kourt, Kim,
and I are going 'cause...

97
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,095
[Malika] You mean,
Kourt, Kim and Malika, right?

98
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,363
I was gonna invite you.

99
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,632
-That's why I was saying it first,...
-[Malika] That's my girl.

100
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,200
-...if you want to come.
-[Tristan laughs]

101
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,101
Amazing.

102
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,836
But I have a few things
that we're gonna do, I just...

103
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,204
[Malika] Like what?

104
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,774
I mean, I have a list of things,
but, like, I don't do that many things.

105
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,077
They think I, like...
What do I do? We do nothing.

106
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,381
{\an8}-We... we stay home and watch TV.
-Literally, I unpack boxes,

107
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,183
{\an8}at least, like, 17 to 20 boxes get sent
to the house a day, so half...

108
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,185
{\an8}Between me and you, not just...
You're trying to say it's just me?

109
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,588
-[Malika laughs]
-You're a... a huge shopper...

110
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,390
{\an8}-...that's like a...
-I don't re-do outfits.

111
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,292
You don't. Definitely, you don't.

112
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,227
It's all gonna be new for me, so...

113
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,595
[Malika] Next stop, the land.

114
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:59,265
So excited for Cleveland,
we'll have so much fun!

115
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,502
[upbeat music]

116
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:12,312
I think Khloé needed to, like,
settle into her Cleveland life.

117
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,280
And I think it was a smart move.

118
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,084
But I'm really excited to go, though,
just to see what Khloé's world is like.

119
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,119
-[Kim] Hey, guys.
-[Khloé] Hi.

120
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,789
Wouldn't you want to come
to the snow in Cleveland?

121
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,124
I don't think Gabbana can handle the snow.

122
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,261
Why can't Gabbana
go in the snow in Cleveland?

123
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,730
She's just so used
to the California weather.

124
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,165
It would be a huge culture shock.

125
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,802
But the summer,
I think we're gonna stay in Cleveland.

126
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,340
[Khloé] 'Cause he's never had a summer
in Cleveland before.

127
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,142
So it's just, like, just to stay there,
do something new.

128
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,645
[Kim] I'm kind of surprised.

129
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,313
Like, it doesn't really make sense to me.

130
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,783
They both don't have family there,
so why would they stay in Cleveland?

131
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,119
-But I'm...
-[Kourtney] I don't think they'll do it.

132
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,721
She has stuff going on in LA.

133
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,723
It's not like she has no life, no job,

134
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,791
-no family.
-But she does put her whole life

135
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,026
on hold for a guy.

136
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,695
Like, her whole life on hold.

137
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,231
-[Mason yells in distance]
-[Khloé] Oh!

138
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,700
The best people in the world are here.

139
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,268
-Hey!
-Penelope's coming.

140
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,003
Because I'm gonna be there so much,

141
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,740
I really want you guys to, like,
have the best time in Cleveland,

142
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,509
so you guys keep wanting
to come to visit me.

143
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,345
-Are you gonna visit me in Cleveland?
-Yeah, I want to go.

144
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,947
-You do?
-I'll see the basketball games.

145
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,082
-What? You would go? Oh, my God.
-[Kim] What?

146
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:27,387
-Northie. Hi, Peepaleep.
-Who's gonna come to Cleveland?

147
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,355
-Me!
-Me!

148
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,190
Let's be in <i>The Cleveland Show!</i>

149
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,559
[Khloé] <i>Oh.</i> The Cleveland Show?

150
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,095
[upbeat music]

151
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,666
{\an8}-[Khloé] So, are we going outside?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

152
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,301
-[blower hissing]
-[indistinct dialogue]

153
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:46,439
[Khloé] Leave it to you
to bring us an oxygen bubble.

154
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,974
Should we change into these?

155
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,308
-Do you want to change into that?
-Yeah!

156
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,743
You can stay in your robe, I don't care.

157
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,612
-[Kourtney] No, I'll change.
-This is so nice.

158
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,414
{\an8}[Kourtney] This is so cute.

159
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,815
{\an8}What does it do, exactly?

160
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,684
{\an8}[Jamie] So, it's enhanced omegas,

161
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,920
helps with fine lines
and we've got it infused with oil.

162
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,156
-[Khloé] You sold me with "fine lines".
-[Jamie] I know, right?

163
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,291
[Khloé laughs]
Ooh!

164
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,959
[Khloé] That's what we look like?
I love it.

165
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,227
Take a picture.

166
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,463
[camera clicks]

167
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,998
[phone rings]

168
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,801
[Kourtney] Ken.

169
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,869
{\an8}-[Kendall] <i>Hello.</i>
-It says "poor connection".

170
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,037
{\an8}Can you hear me?

171
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,606
[Kendall] <i>Barely.</i>

172
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,241
-<i>It's just my service.</i>
-Oh.

173
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,677
<i>I might have to call you
when I get to my hotel.</i>

174
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,813
[Kourtney] Are you okay? You sound so sad.

175
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,315
[Kendall] <i>I'm all right.</i>

176
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,818
[Kourtney] I talked to Simon today.

177
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,821
He was like, "The news lasts 24 hours."

178
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,225
[Kendall] <i>I know, but it's lasting longer.</i>

179
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:45,565
Kendall did a commercial,
and basically caused a huge controversy.

180
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,267
And it sucks, because Kendall's
been taking the blame for it all.

181
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,510
Kendall tries really hard
to be socially conscious

182
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,479
and aware of the jobs that she takes

183
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:03,049
and to really think
about how things affect other people.

184
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,017
So it weighs really heavy on her heart

185
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,953
and she's super sensitive
to this kind of stuff.

186
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,823
{\an8}Um, Russell Simmons
called me yesterday to talk about you.

187
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,426
{\an8}And he was like,
"She can turn this into a positive."

188
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,629
{\an8}And then he was gonna call Mom,
so I don't know if they ever spoke.

189
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,099
[Kendall] <i>Yeah, he did.
She called me and told me.</i>

190
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,567
[Kendall sniffles]

191
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,836
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-[tense music playing]

192
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,204
Um...

193
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,206
All right.
Well, call us when you get to your room.

194
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,243
-[Kendall] <i>Okay.</i>
-[Kourtney] Love you.

195
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,577
-[Kendall] <i>Love you too.</i>
-Bye.

196
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,413
She really sounded like
she was, like, crying.

197
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,352
Kendall's intent is never
to disrespect or offend anybody.

198
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,087
Poor thing.

199
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,694
{\an8}[upbeat music]

200
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,406
-Hey!
-Hi, good morning!

201
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,242
Ladies and gentlemen!

202
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,280
[Khloé] Hey, guys!

203
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,749
We're all going to Cleveland!

204
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,350
-Wait, are you guys so excited?
-[whoops]

205
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,452
-'Cause I am.
-We're going to the land.

206
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,187
To the land down under.

207
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,656
The land and beyond.

208
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,259
My family and everyone coming
to Cleveland is working out perfectly,

209
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,262
because we have time to enjoy Cleveland

210
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,065
and not be a distraction to Tristan
in any way.

211
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:30,703
He is on the road and then he gets back
the last night before everybody leaves.

212
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,107
So he gets to see everybody and just...
Everything's working out perfectly

213
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,842
[Khloé] Tristan is like,
"Where are they staying?"

214
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,578
And I was like, "Why do you care so much?"

215
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,547
And he was like, "I just want everybody
to want to come back a second time.

216
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,382
-So, I want everything to be so nice."
-[Malika] Oh, he's so cute.

217
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,118
{\an8}He's just being a sweetheart.
I'm sure we'll be fine

218
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,087
{\an8}and nothing will keep us
from coming to visit you.

219
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,655
{\an8}[Khloé] It was like, "Oh, my God."

220
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,258
Wait, so you guys. I'm looking online.

221
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,027
So, like, things are coming out
about Caitlyn's book.

222
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,330
-[Kourtney] Yeah?
-And it says, "Caitlyn Jenner reveals

223
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,900
she has now undergone
gender reassignment surgery."

224
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,168
{\an8}[Kourtney] Stop.

225
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,903
{\an8}So that means they snipped?

226
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,004
[Kim] Yeah, they snipped.

227
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,073
But, like,
why couldn't she say that to us?

228
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,941
I... Like, we would understand.

229
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,144
[Kim] She makes it,
"Woe is me, woe is me".

230
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:15,715
"I'm the victim. I'm this, and...
They don't want to see me.

231
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,882
It's, like, [bleep] off.

232
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,618
And it's not 'cause you're trans.

233
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,853
[Khloé] That's not why
I'm not talking to you.

234
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,489
I'm not talking to you
'cause you're a bad, mean person.

235
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:31,297
I just don't get why you would go
to the trouble of giving me a book,

236
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,332
and saying, "Here's my book.
I want you to read it."

237
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,936
Clearly, she gave me a different book
with everything edited out

238
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,804
that she didn't want us to see.

239
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,740
It's just again, that, like,...

240
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,907
-It's just like...
-...fakeness.

241
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,111
...the personality
just doesn't vibe with ours.

242
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,480
[Khloé] I wonder what the weather's like.

243
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,816
Weirdly, it said it was gonna be,
like, 75 when I checked,

244
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,652
but it was snowing on Friday.

245
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,388
[Malika] Oh, good ol' Lake Erie.

246
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,024
-Yeah! Lake Erie.
-[Malika] I see it.

247
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,458
[Malika] Hallelujah, Cleveland!

00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,194

an International Sibling Day pic?

00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,074

-Mm-hm.

Good afternoon,

-I'm Tony.

-Nice to see you.
-Chief Operating Officer.

00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,126
[Khloé] I've never been here.
It's so nice.

261
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,630
[Kourtney] You guys, don't I look,
like, um, like I'm drunk?

262
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,597
[Khloé] You look drunk.

263
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,933
[Kourtney] Coming in
from the night before.

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,369
-[Malika] You look hung over.
-[Khloé] I need to take a picture of you.

265
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,405
-One, two...

266
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,307
-[Khloé] Mood.
-[Kourtney] Traveling.

00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,646
-[Khloé] Oh, wow! What a nice room!
-[Kourtney] Ooh!

268
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,215
Kourt, you could take a bath
and we could watch you.

269
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,183
[Kourtney] Yes.

270
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,584
-[Malika] She does that at home.
-[Kourtney] Yep.

271
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,286
[Khloé] I want to sit here
while you bathe.

272
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,387
And that is true.

00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,822
-[Malika] That is true.
-[Kourtney] We do do that.

um, Cleveland tour started, guys?

I cannot wait to get this show
on the road. I'm so excited.

278
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,170
And the great thing is,
is that some of Tristan's friends

279
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,039
who are now some of my really good friends

280
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,875
are in Cleveland
even though Tristan's at an away game.

281
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:27,246
And I'm just excited to do some little
pre-gaming, cocktails, happy hour time.

282
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,248
-Yeah.
-I am just here to live life.

-[Kourtney] Yeah.

-[Malika] Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,591
Oh, I thought you were naked
but you're not, your shirt...

00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:39,892
[Simon] Yeah, me too.
I thought you were naked too.

288

why are you letting us in here?

-[woman 4] Welcome to Vault.
-[Kourtney] We get our own vault.

-[Khloé] Ooh!
-[Kourtney] How exciting, you guys,

304
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,323
we're in Cleveland.

305
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,059
Steph's hometown and Khloé's new hometown.

306
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,762
-[Khloé whoops]
-[Kim] So what are we gonna do here?

307
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,365
-Are we gonna see Tristan's house?
-[Khloé] We're gonna go...

308
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,401
Our house. It's a duo house.

309
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,170
-We're gonna go...
-Khloé and Tristan's house.

310
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,471
No, it's really Tristan's,
I'm just kidding.

311
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,339
No, it's both of your houses.
The interior.

312
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,376
[all] Aww!

313
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,145
That's good when the best friend says it
and he's not even here.

314
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,181
-I mean, technically it's not.
-[Savas] No, it is.

315
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,684
[Khloé] Then tomorrow,
we're gonna go by the I-X Center.

316
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,719
-It's an indoor amusement park.
-It's a whole amusement park.

317
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,589
The whole place is rented out for us.

318
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,357
[Malika] I haven't been to the I-X Center
since I was, like, 12.

319
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,394
If Tristan lands in time,
he might come by.

320
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,062
Then tonight we're gonna go
to dinner at Red's.

321
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,497
Red's was actually,
I think, one of the first...

322
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,700
[Kim] Oh, this wasn't just our dinner?
I just ate, like, five plates.

323
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,269
How was this dinner?
This is called cocktail hour.

324
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,772
-I ate everything.
-[Kourtney] We were having a cocktail.

325
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,141
-You thought this was dinner?
-I thought this was our dinner

326
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,409
and I, like, ate everything.

327
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,244
-[laughter]
-[Kim] I literally, I'm full.

328
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,112
I'm still hungry.

329
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,314
[laughs]

330
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,519

-[Kourtney] Khloé! Khloé!

332
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,757
[Kourtney] We look like such
Hollywood idiots in all of our furs.

333
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,326
[Malika] I don't give a [bleep].

334
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,494
-[horn honks]
-[Khloé] Hey, girl.

335
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,533
It is, like, an amazing feeling just
to walk down the street and feel free.

336
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,602
-Well, 'cause no one's here, right?
-Free at last.

337
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,904
-Free at last.
-[fan] Hey, Khloé!

338

339
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,841
-[Simon] Queen bee of Cleveland, eh?
-[Kourtney] Whoo-hoo, Khloé!

340
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,776
Oh, Kourtney!

341
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,346
-[Kim] The queen of Cleveland.
-[Khloé] Kim K!

342
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,814

-[Khloé] W!

343
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,383
[Khloé whoops]

344
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,685
-[Kourtney] Hi.
-[woman 5] How are you?

345
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,287
[Kourtney] Good, how are you?

346
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:53,058
So guys, I just want to say,
what a nice walk we just had.

347
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,628
-That was lovely.
-That was nice.

348
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,764
To walk the streets and, like,
not be bombarded

349
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,600
with, like, paps or whatever,
like, wasn't that, like, refreshing?

350
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,637
-We should all move to Cleveland.
-[Khloé] Chin-chin to that.

351
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,472
-Chin-chin.
-Chin-chin.

352
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,773
[Khloé] Clink-clink.

353
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,242
-[Savas] Clink-clink.
-[Malika] You're so happy. I love this.

354
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,111
'Cause we're free here, guys.

355
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,613
Look who messaged me out of nowhere.
[Simon laughs]

356
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,981
-[Khloé] Stop.
-[Simon] I swear to God.

357
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,182
-[Khloé] Who?
-[Simon] K.D.

358
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,919
Stop. What did he say?
It's not out of nowhere.

359
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,554
-Who's KD?
-[Simon] Basketball player. Kevin Durant.

360
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,823
Is this the one that was,
like, saying you're cute?

361
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,826
-Well, one of many.
-[Khloé] One of the 59.

362
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,697
I feel like there's a constant urge
to set me up

363
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,032
-from everyone.
-You're in the hot seat, hon.

364
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,001
That's all people get.
It's like, "Hook me up with Kourtney."

365
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,670
You know what someone said to me
the other day?

366
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,672
-What?
-'Cause there was this cute guy.

367
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,374
They were like, "He's an escalator,
and you're an elevator."

368
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,044
But they... they both do the same thing.

369
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,414
The escalator kind of goes down,
and the elevator's going up.

370
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,416
They both go up and down, technically.

371
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,585
Just in my... in my brain,
that's what happens.

372
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,021
-[Khloé] You want to play truth or truth?
-[Stephanie] What's truth or truth?

373
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,925
Truth or truth is a game
that we made up this summer

374
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,694
to get to know the boys better,

375
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,330
and it's just
you have to say the truth, basically.

376
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,332
So, we ask questions.
You don't get truth or dare.

377
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,401
-Who the [bleep] wants to do a dare?
-[Kourtney laughs]

378
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,869
[Malika] You have such an awkward laugh.

379
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,372
-First question goes to Steph.
-[Stephanie] Oh, no.

380
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,708
Why do you have that feather tattoo
on your middle finger?

381
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,243
Because my friend used
to have a tattoo shop,

382
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,379
and I used to get drunk there
and get stupid tattoos.

383
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,947
-All right, now your turn.
-[Stephanie] That was that.

384
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,415
You could ask someone any question.

385
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,317
Doesn't have to be deep.
It could be anything you want.

386
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,019
Would you have another baby with Scott?

387
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,422
-Mmm...
-[Khloé] Ooh.

388
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:35,561
I feel like I would
if the situation was right.

389
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:39,164
But that doesn't mean, like, tomorrow,
guys, so don't get any ideas.

390
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,434
-Okay, girl.
-Okay, I'm gonna ask Khloé.

391
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,435
-Okay.
-[Khloé] Really? Oh.

392
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,138
Even though you get to see her
and ask her all the time?

393
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,007
-Whatever he wants to ask.
-It's his choice.

394
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,241
[overlapping chatter]

395
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,909
-Simon, it's your choice.
-Okay, Khloé.

396
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,145
When do you want
to have a child with Tristan?

397
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,514
-[Malika] There it is!
-See? Got to heat it up.

398
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,584
-[all cheering]
-That's what I'm talking about.

399
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,052
[cheering continues]

400
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,688
-[Khadijah] I knew it was gonna be good.
-Now we're playing, baby.

401
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,090
[exhales]
Uh...

402
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,793
I mean, I really don't know.

403
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,994
-[everyone jeers]
-No.

404
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,297
-[bleep]
-[clamoring]

405
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,601
I honestly wish we could just be together,
and, like, when it happens, it happens.

406
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,769
-[Simon] No, no.
-[Khloé] No, no, no.

407
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,971
When you make plans, God laughs.

408
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:24,676
Tristan and I, within the next 70 years,
we will, hopefully, have kids together.

409
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,881
And if not, it will just be him
and I clubbing it up.

-I am going back to my room.
-[Malika] You're going to bed.

413
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,091
Just 'cause I've been sick,
I want to, like, try to sleep it off.

414
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,893
-[Malika] I understand.
-[Simon] Oh, my God.

415
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,561
-[Khloé] Kourt.
-[Simon] Kourtney, come see your fans.

416
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,196
Whoa.

-[fans cheering]

I mean, it's a huge company.

421
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,585
[Kendall] The people I was following
were so iconic and amazing.

422
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,188
Michael Jackson's done it.
Britney Spears has done it.

423
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,889
Beyoncé has done it... Pink.

The list goes on.

425

So to get something like that is just...
it was so exciting.

426
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,299
[Kendall] And I trusted everyone.
I trusted the teams.

and I... and I read
what people had to say about it,

430
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:32,744
I most definitely saw...
what was, what went wrong.

431
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,279
I was so stuck,

432
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:38,383

I come back in, like, a few days.</i>

437
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,099
<i>So I just wanted to see how you're doing.
And maybe I'll come over</i>

438
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,668
<i>so we can talk face-to-face,</i>

439
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,170
-<i>you know?</i>
-Yeah, no, totally.

440
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,039
Um, I think you should come over
so we can, like, hang out or whatever,

441
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,208
but, uh, Dad called me and was like,

442
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,946
"I'm going on a...
on a book tour, and I'm nervous.

443
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,216
I'm gonna... Like, I'm...
What if I get asked about the commercial?"

444
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,752
And I was like, "Just keep it brief
or something or whatever."

445
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,053
And she was like, "All right, all right."

446
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,123
And now I'm, like, nervous that she's,
like, gonna try and keep it brief,

447
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,958
but to her, brief is not so brief.

448
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,328
Like, she just tends to, like, say a lot,

449
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,131
and I just would rather everyone
just not say anything.

450
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,468
[Kim] <i>I mean, you know
she'll probably say something.</i>

451
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,903
[Kendall]
I mean, God bless her for trying.

452
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,104
[Kim] <i>I know, I know.</i>

453
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:36,141
<i>But, like, Caitlyn, like,
is known for saying all the wrong things.</i>

454
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,076
-<i>That's just who she is, you know?</i>
-I know.

455
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,379
The only problem is,
like, whatever she says,

456
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,115
because she's my dad,
people are gonna, like, really believe it.

457
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,217
And, like, take it and run with it,
when it's like,

458
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,387
"What does she even actually know?"

459
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,955
-You know what I mean?
-[Kim] <i>Yeah.</i>

460
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,391
[Kim] <i>Well, I can call her
and just, like, make it clear.</i>

00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:56,094
<i>Like, "Hey, this is, like,
a really sensitive subject."</i>

462
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,665
<i>Just that she knows, knows, knows,
like, not to say anything or what to say</i>

00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,737
-Yeah.
-It's, like, 40.

477
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,406
-No. It's, like, 74 degrees.
-I stand proud in my fur.

478
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,575
-How about you?
-Let me tell you the exact temperature.

479
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,210
[Kourtney] I'm gonna tell you guys.

480
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,247
-Outside right now?
-Except that I'm on maps.

481
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,116
-And not the weather.
-Why would you look at maps

482
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,818
-for the weather?
-I made a mistake.

483
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,019
Oh, I was like...

484
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,220
[Malika] It's the tequila.

485
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,723
-[indistinct crowd chatter]
-[glass clinks]

486
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,058
-[Khloé] My mom is pissed.
-[Stephanie] Why?

487
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,427
[Khloé] Caitlyn had gender
reassignment surgery.

488
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,796
My mom just found out.
It's all in a group chat.

489
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,231
Let's FaceTime Kris.

490
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,600
-Let's FaceTime K.J.
-[line ringing]

491
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,205
{\an8}-What's up, Kris?
-[women shriek]

492
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,345
-[whoops]
-Smile!

493
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,214
-Mom, don't cry.
-No! No, Mommy!

494
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,915
-No! We love you!
-Don't cry!

495
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,151
-[Malika] Please don't cry.
-[Kris] <i>It's shocking!</i>

496
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,053
[Malika] I know. Oh, my God.

497
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,990
[Khloé] Mom has been going through this
for a long time, and it sucks.

498
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,526
This isn't the first time
Cait has left things out

499
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,663
and for us to find out in the media.

500
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:42,067
I would have been totally fine
with everything that Caitlyn has to say.

501
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,405
But she came and gave me the book
but left out all of these extra pages.

502
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,674
-Like, why... why leave that out?
-Shady.

503
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,976
Like, that's...
Yeah. That's just, like, not cool.

504
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,345
I just don't understand
what her point is then.

505
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,348
-Like, why even show you guys? Right.
-Give me the book for a heads-up.

506
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,117
-Like, I don't get it.
-'Cause it's a phony-ass heads-up.

507
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,620
-Oh, my God. I want to go home now.
-Mommy, I miss you.

508
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,388
-Stop. Let's Malika talk to her.
-No, Malika.

509
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,524
-Don't cry with her, though.
-My mom's crying.

510
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,893
[Malika] No, I'm not.
Just let me give her a moment.

511
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,528
Mommy, I understand.

512
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,563
And this person has made a decision
to change your life,

513
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,498
and this is gonna affect you
and it's gonna hurt.

514
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:18,236
<i>I never had any idea and I never
would've done this to my kids and...</i>

515
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,504
[Malika] I know. I know.

516
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,239
[Kris] <i>It's just hard.
It's just really hard.</i>

517
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:26,144
<i>I just feel like I'm always in the dark,
always the last to know anything!</i>

518
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:30,082
<i>And it's... it's wild,
and I don't know what else to do.</i>

519
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,883
[tense music fades]

520
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,856
I'm gonna say something to you
that you would say to us.

521
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,260
Lighten your heart knowing
that you have done everything

522
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,895
to protect your family,

523
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:48,066
and we cannot decide what other people do.

524
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,936
When everyone said that Kris this
and Kris that

525
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,938
and what Kris didn't do for her marriage,

526
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:57,008
that was all bull[bleep] and guess what.
It's all coming to light now.

527
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,912
-[Kris] <i>Yeah.</i>
-It's not you. We love you so much.

528
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,914
{\an8}<i>-I love you guys.</i>
-And we want you to be okay.

529
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,283
<i>I'm really glad
that you're there with each other,</i>

530
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,185
<i>because it... it makes me happy.</i>

531
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,353
[Malika] And we know that.

532
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,323
<i>Maybe the girls can check in
on Kendall and Kylie.</i>

533
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,259
-Okay. But I think that...
-[Kris] <i>I just want them to be okay.</i>

534
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,161
<i>-You know, that's all that matters.</i>
-Mommy... Honey...

535
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,496
<i>It's not even about me.</i>

536
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,164
<i>I just want them to be okay.</i>

537
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,000
They're gonna be okay
because they have you.

538
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,170
<i>Yeah. Okay, so I have one favor.</i>

539
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,204
Yes, ma'am.

540
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,408
<i>-I need one more cheer.</i>
-[Malika] Okay.

541
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:35,280
Okay, guys, Mommy's ready for a cheer.
One, two, three!

542
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,850
[everyone cheering]

543
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,885
[Kris chuckles]

544
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,654
-[Kris] <i>I love you very much.</i>
-Are you good?

545
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,824
-[Kris] <i>Yeah, I'm okay. Love you.</i>
-Everybody's thinking of you. Mwah!

546
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,192
-Love you.
-Love you!

547
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,027
-[Kris] <i>Have fun!</i>
-Thank you!

548
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,028
Bye, Mom!

549
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,099
Do you think we should ask Kendall
and Kylie if they know about their dad?

550
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,667
Isn't that, like, so weird?

551
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,370
No, I don't think you should ask
if they know.

552
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,738
I think you should check on them,

553
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,207
just in case they're reacting
the way your mom is.

554
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,708
I'm gonna text them and say,

555
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,444
"Hi, my sisters.

556
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,780
How are you?"

557
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:13,552
Seeing how Mom is reacting,
I am worried about Kendall and Kylie.

558
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,921
And I just feel like Kendall's
going through so much right now

559
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,089
because of the commercial.

560
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,593
I... I mean, it's a lot to handle
and just that everything's so public.

561
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,163
Guys, don't we want to go back,
put on pajamas, and hang out?

562
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,499
[Khadijah] My pickup is 4:30 a.m.

563
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,335
-Oh, my God. What time is your flight?
-4:30 a.m.?

564
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,336
6:00.

565
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,673
Ew. That's, like, so rude.

566
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,276
-I love you so much.
-I love you more.

567
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,878
-[Simon] Bye, Kourt.
-Bye.

568
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,447
I like Cleveland!

569
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:46,251
I think I have little pieces of hair...

570
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,986
-[Stephanie] You are shedding.
-...everywhere.

571
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,254
-[Khadijah] Leave her alone.
-[Stephanie laughs]

572
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,922
What's wrong with you? Are you crying?

573
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,758
-Go to the back.
-Why are you crying?

574
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,962
-Why are you crying?
-[Khadijah] Oh, my gosh!

575
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,497
What does this have to do with?

576
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,499
She's crying 'cause she doesn't want
to leave Khloé.

577
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,533
[Kourtney] Stop.

578
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,502
Oh, my God.

579
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,338
-You don't want to leave your bestie?
-[phone rings]

580
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,674
{\an8}-Hi.
-[Khloé] <i>Malika, what's wrong with you?</i>

581
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,243
{\an8}Nothing. I'm fine.

582
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,946
-[Khloé] <i>Why are you crying?</i>
-I stubbed my toe.

583
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,481
[snorts]

584
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,617
[Kourtney] She's legit, like, shaking.

585
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,020
Even when I leave Khloé,
I don't, like, cry like that.

586
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,089
-Are we bad sisters?
-No.

587
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,191
They're some people,
who, like, their friends are,

588
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,959
like, that important to them.

589
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,063
-I've never met anyone like that.
-[laughs]

590
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,567
[Khloé] <i>Thank you for coming out here.
It was so fun, right?</i>

591
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,069
I had the best time. I love you so much.

592
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,405
-[Khloé] <i>I love you too.</i>
-[Malika] Good night, honey.

593
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,707
[laughs]

594
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,510
I'm not laughing at you, Malika,
but I'm laughing at you because

595
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,345
I just heard you...
[shudders]

596
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,915
-[laughing]
-[bleep] you, Khadijah.

597
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,384
[Khadijah] It was unexpected.
You're so huffy and puffy.

598
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,087
-Enough, already.
-You two heartless bitches in the front.

599
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,390
[upbeat music playing]

600
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,432
[Kourtney] So, do you
know your way around?

601
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,434
Just to go downtown,

602
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,337
'cause I go to basketball game
after basketball game.

603
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,005
Look how big this house is.

604
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,274
-This huge house.
-I feel like I'd get murdered

605
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,842
in one of these homes.

606
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,010
Thanks, Kim.

607
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,446
Thanks for coming to my home.

608
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,315
It's so nice when people talk like that.

609
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,383
-No one's there except the trees.
-[Kourtney] This is so pretty.

610
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,218
This is so cute.

611
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,987
[Kim] Oh, look at the water.

612
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,895
-[Kim] It's so nice.
-[Khloé] Thank you.

613
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,597
[Stephanie] My gosh, Khloé, your face.

614
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:40,999
The boys got me that Marilyn Monroe,
like, picture,

615
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,500
and they got it painted with me.

616
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,502
'Cause they know I love Marilyn Monroe.

617
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,371
-[Stephanie] That's so sweet.
-[Khloé] So nice.

618
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,107
Let's let Kourt sit at the head
of the table.

619
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,743
-[Kourtney] Okay.
-[phone chime]

620
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,345
[Khloé] No arguing there.

621
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,182
Uh, it says, "In Caitlyn's book,

622
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,185
Robert Kardashian
knew O.J. Simpson was guilty

623
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,087
but joined the defense team to get back

624
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,855
-at his remarried ex."
-[Khloé] What?

625
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,125
Uh, "Robert told Caitlyn in secret
after O.J.'s murder trial

626
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,927
that he believed his friend was guilty."

627
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,796
That's not true.
That's not the, like... What?

628
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:16,334
It's just wild. My dad so believed in him.

629
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,371
Like, to sell a book,

630
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,773
-you're gonna make something up?
-[Kim] Yeah.

631
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:27,145
It is so shady that Caitlyn came over

632
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,414
and gave me the book,
and then, on the phone, she said,

633
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,118
"Well, the final version
has a few more things in it.

634
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,553
But don't worry. It's nothing about you."

635
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,658
So she lied to me 'cause that is about me
if it's about our dad.

636
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:43,228
My relationship with Caitlyn was strange

637
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:46,931
and I just was trying to just...
be respectful.

638
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,233
-And...
-You're very...

639
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,202
-You have the most patience.
-[Kim] Yeah.

640
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,305
But if you talk about my dad,
I will cut you.

641
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,242
I have always had Caitlyn's back,

642
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:01,012
but she is... a liar.

643
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,048
She is not a good person.

644
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,750
[tense music]

645
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,354
{\an8}[upbeat music]

646
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,223
[Khloé] This is where I always do
the snaps 'cause it's so pretty.

647
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,825
-[Stephanie] Mm-hm. Yes.
-It's like endless.

648
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,326
You can't see where, like...

649
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,661
-[Stephanie] It's like an ocean.
-[Khloé] Right.

650
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,697
[Kourtney] Let's get the grand tour.

651
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,365
[Khloé] I'll take you guys
down to the basement.

652
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,269
-Oh, this is where your phone never works.
-Oh, cute!

653
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:28,139
Yes, this is where my phone never works.
But this is the KhloCD of it all.

654
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,076
-[Stephanie] Yes.
-[Kim] Cute! Nerds!

655
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,744
Oh, my God, I want some Nerds.

656
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,113
-[Stephanie] How cute are you?
-[Kim] Mmm.

657
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,615
This is where I'm doing the KhloCD,
and I, like, love it.

658
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,120
Look at your fish tank. Cute.

659
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,355
[Khloé] Kim wants to critique so bad.

660
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:49,694
Whenever you hear "cute",
it doesn't mean she likes it.

661
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,963
-[Stephanie] I like it.
-[Khloé] I love it here.

662
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,566
Tristan's house is so cute.

663
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,403
It's really just fun
to see Khloé's touch on the house.

664
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,971
-Yes.
-You really can.

665
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,240
[Kourtney] Blankets, the flowers.

666
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,776
Bed's a little small for them,
don't you think?

667
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,845
-[Kourtney] Probably.
-[Khloé] The judging is starting.

668
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,080
[Kim] I'm not judging. Relax.

669
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,483
So, this is the KoKo section.

670
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,718
But he's so cute. He's always like,
"I'm gonna move my stuff"

671
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,587
and "Bring more stuff over."

672
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,921
-Cute.
-He's just very nice,

673
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,724
and I appreciate how, like...

674
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,695
how comfortable he wants me to be.
I appreciate that.

675
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,532
[Khloé] This summer,
we're doing, like, a few projects.

676
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,367
We're redoing that whole laundry room.

677
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,902
[Kim] This is, like, official.

678
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,305
I knew you had stuff here,
but I thought stuff was, like...

679
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,640
Like in a corner?

680
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,075
-A little drawer?
-Yeah.

681
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,611
She definitely had way more
than I imagined.

682
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,513
Like, she had a full half-side
of the closet.

683
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,548
Yeah, and she had, like,
a million bags and...

684
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,817
-[Kim] Those huge Chanel bags.
-[Kourtney] And shoes

685
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,719
and just tons of stuff.

686
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,989
It was, like,
definitely, like, their closet.

687
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,224
[Kim] Like, we knew it,
but, like, seeing it.

688
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,727
It was like, a big realization
that, like, okay,

689
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,296
Khloé lives in Cleveland, practically,
you know?

690
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,932
And she's not rushing
to come home anytime soon.

691
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,936
This is more of a Kourtney bag
than a Khloé, don't you guys think?

692
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,306
Cute. So, do they have
good shopping here and stuff?

693
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,407
[Khloé] Apparently.

694
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,243
[Kim] And then what's on the upper floor?

695
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,778
[Khloé]
We don't have to look at every room.

696
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,481
[pop music playing]

697
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,592
All right, so, I'm gonna call Caitlyn
and not mention

698
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,428
how annoyed I am
with all of her fake accusations.

699
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,798
I'll just talk about the commercial,
and that's it.

700
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:34,699
[Kourtney] Yeah.

701
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:38,469
Kendall's issue is just
a little bit bigger now than our feelings,

702
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,272
so I want to make sure
that she's protected.

703
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,308
And if I have to call Caitlyn,
I'll do that.

704
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,243
Like, I'll do whatever I can.

705
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,079
-[line ringing]
-[somber music playing]

706
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,782
{\an8}-[Caitlyn] <i>Hello?</i>
-Hey.

707
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,118
So, I wanted to call you
and talk to you about Kendall,

708
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,254
because I feel like she's really nervous.

709
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,591
She said to me
you're going on a book tour,

710
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,926
and if the commercial gets brought up,

711
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:05,463
you could just be refreshed
of, like, what to say.

712
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,165
[Caitlyn] <i>Okay. All right.</i>

713
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,702
So, I think if you just stick to,
"Kendall had the best intentions

714
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,304
with this being something, like, peaceful,

715
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,541
and she totally gets
everyone's point of view now.

716
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,677
It was not appropriate,
and she's so sorry."

717
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,279
-[Caitlyn] <i>Right.</i>
-[Kim] It's just sad.

718
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,414
[Caitlyn] <i>Yeah,
and a couple of people tweeted,</i>

719
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,284
<i>and it was just a joke.
The whole thing's a joke.</i>

720
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,621
<i>That's not what this is about.
They keep running the damn thing.</i>

721
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,024
-<i>You know?</i>
-You should not be mentioning at all.

722
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,493
Yeah, I just don't think
you should mention this at all,

723
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,928
because you're gonna get in really

724
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,429
-hot water...
-[Caitlyn] <i>I will not mention it.</i>

725
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,899
-...for saying any of this stuff.
-<i>I'm venting with you.</i>

726
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,233
-Okay.
-<i>I would never do that</i>

727
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,469
-<i>in the media.</i>
-Okay. All right.

728
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,538
I think I have bad service here.
I'll call you in a little bit.

729
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,707
-[Caitlyn] <i>Okay.</i>
-Okay, bye.

730
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,377
Like, that's just...

731
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,280
Shouldn't even be brought up.

732
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,651
-I told her, so we'll see.
-Yeah.

733
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,255
[Khloé] Look, I found a floating hot dog.

734
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,324
[lively music]

735
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:08,726
[Khloé] Tristan!

736
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,795
[whooping, laughs]

737
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,330
He's like, "Yay! Yay!"

738
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,364
Hungry.

739
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,366
You're hungry already?

740
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,735
-I'm starved already.
-Yeah, I'm a big boy.

741
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:18,903
Oh, you have food.

742
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,173
Mm-hm. What is it, soft cookies?

743
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,342
-You don't like the soft ones?
-Huh?

744
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,144
Wait. Is this a bathroom or no?

745
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,179
[Khloé] No, but you could go in there
if you want.

746
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,948
-Okay.
-[Tristan] There's another bathroom.

747
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,216
-I want to see what this is.
-[Tristan] That's a lit room.

748
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,252
[Kourtney] Ooh, candles galore.

749
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,020
Oh, a hoverboard.

750
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,256
I have a hoverboard
in my front closet, too.

751
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,024
-[Khloé] Oh!
-[Kourtney] I have two of them.

752
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,059
Two? Oh.

753
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,795
-Ballin'.
-[Kourtney] Are you coming, Tristan?

754
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,064
-Mm-hm.
-[Kim] Ooh!

755
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,765
-[Kourtney] Thank you.
-[Tristan] There's lions and tigers.

756
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,000
-[Kourtney] Yeah, and bears.
-[Kim] And funnel cakes.

757
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,435
-[Kim] Oh, my.
-[Khloé] Oh, my!

758
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,972
It's my favorite place in the world!
The amusement park.

759
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,573
Your energy.

760
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,041
First of all, it's enclosed.

761
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,876
Have you ever been
to an indoors amusement park?

762
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,812
Like, there's endless amounts
of funnel cake,

763
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,047
-churros, food...
-Anything you want.

764
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,716
-Anything.
-Hot dogs the size

765
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:08,252
-of the biggest [bleep].
-Of big old [bleep]. Like, seriously.

766
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,955
[Khloé] Alcohol, rides.

767
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:11,956
Oh.

768
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,992
Best day ever.

769
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,028
[Khloé] When you get an amusement park
all to yourself.

770
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,430
-Yeah!
-[women screaming]

771
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,966
-[all screaming]
-[Stephanie whoops]

772

-[screaming continues]
-[laughing]

773

[whoops]

774
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,378
Hey, guys, I brought a friend.

775
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,346
-[chortling]
-[barks]

776
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,948
-What's its name?
-[man] Her name is Kim.

777
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:37,949
-[Khloé] Kim?
-[man 4] Yeah.

778
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,517
Oh, my gosh, her name is Kim?

779
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,753
-[Kim] <i>Aw.</i>
-[Khloé] <i>Kim, you're so cute.</i>

780
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:44,622
Oh, look, you guys,
there are so many Kanyes in here.

781
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,192
[gasping]
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

782
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,495
-[goat bleating]
-[Khloé] Best day of my life.

783
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,196
Where are we going next?

784
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:56,200
-Alien Invasion.
-Alien Invasion! Everyone!

785
00:33:56,267 --> 00:34:01,005
If you don't go on Alien Invasion,
you're not a part of the crew anymore.

786
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,574
-[man laughs]
-Just get on the ride.

787
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,577
There's, like, a whole new Kourt
ever since she's not been with Scott,

788
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:07,678
-and I love it.
-Totally.

789
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,481
-[Kim] Unrecognizable.
-[Khloé] Like, a way lighter, fun.

790
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,950
She's, like, bullying people
into going on all the rides.

791
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,019
Like, she's just, like, down for whatever.

792
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,488
-[Kourtney] Are we doing the Gravitron?
-Yeah!

793
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,792
[Kourtney] such a [bleep] idiot
if you don't get on.

794
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,494
-[Kourtney] Why aren't you doing it?
-I'm not a dropper.

795
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,497
[Kourtney] It's just a quick drop.
It's like you're falling in love.

796
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,266
[Khloé] Oh, my God.

797
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,703
Kim, we won't charge you for the Kimojis.

798
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,405
Kimberly!

-[Stephanie] Look at Tristan's face.
-Oh, my God. Let's do it again.

<i>Tristan. Love my life.</i>

00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,254
[Khloé] Oh, damn!

804
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,389
Babe.

805
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,893
Yeah!
[Khloé laughs]

806
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,895
[light music]

807
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,700
[Kim] We really do miss Khloé,

808
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:06,003
and just knowing that
so much of her life is here in Cleveland

809
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,540
is, you know, just hard to accept.

810
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,843
Yeah. I think it's just bittersweet,
you know?

811
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:15,813
Like, I'm happy for her
that she's with Tristan, but then,

812
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,984
it's just sad that she's, like,
definitely not coming back anytime soon.

813
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,054
-[laughter]
-[light music fades]

814
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:28,626
[Khloé] Kourt and Kim I just want to say
thank you guys for coming to Cleveland.

815
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,496
I appreciate you guys
taking time away from your kids

816
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,966
and being here for me and seeing,
like, an experience of my life.

817
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,468
-You are living life over here.
-[light music]

818
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,839
Seriously, thank you. Like, you guys
to come all the way to Cleveland.

819
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,742
You don't owe me anything
and you don't need to come here.

820
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,278
I appreciate that,
and I'm sure Tristan appreciates that.

821
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,547
-[Tristan] Very much so.
-And thank you, and that's all.

822
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,249
-[Stephanie] Oh.
-[Kim] Aw.

823
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,551
I'm definitely sad that Khloé's gone,

824
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,320
but Khloé and Tristan
are really cute together.

825
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,322
[Kim] She's got a good crew over there.

826
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,124
She's got a good support system.

827
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,160
We know she's safe.
We don't have to worry.

828
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,594
-She's in good hands.
-Yeah.

829
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,098
[Kourtney] And I feel like we're all
living our lives and doing our own thing.

830
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,134
-So let her live hers.
-Let her live. Yeah.

831
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,836
-We're here for you.
-I wish you guys would come to a game,

832
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,704
-but that will be next time.
-I know. I can't believe

833
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,540
-we didn't stay an extra day.
-A game?

834
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,441
A basketball game, you know?

835
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,711
-There's a game tomorrow.
-Why? Basketball? Why?

836
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,481
You know, play a little...
little rubber ball here and there.

837
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:27,285
[laughs]
You can't say we didn't live life today.

838
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,187
-Did it.
-Bye.

839
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,022
-Goodbye.
-I love you.

840
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,558
[upbeat music]

841
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,100
[Kendall sniffles]

842
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,507
-Hi.
-What's wrong?

843
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,143
Like, someone calls me with more bad news,

844
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,213
like every five minutes.
It's just so stressful.

845
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,783
[Kim] How are you doing with,
like, things in the book,

846
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:02,086
how it says she did the gender
reassignment surgery and all that?

847
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,489
She told Kylie and I
before the book came out.

848
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,325
-Okay.
-What upsets me the most

849
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,893
is that Dad brought up the commercial.

850
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,829
-Without even me saying anything.
-And I even called her and said,

851
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,964
-"Don't say anything."
-I know, I remember.

852
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,765
Like I was so...

853
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,400
-Couldn't have been more clear.
-Yeah.

854
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,037
My dad brought up the commercial
in her interview.

855
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,739
[announcer]
<i>Caitlyn Jenner said she watched</i>

856
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,574
<i>her daughter's controversial commercial.</i>

857
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,511
<i>She notes that Kendall is a model
and they hired her to go do this,</i>

858
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,716
<i>adding that Kendall saw the script
beforehand and thought it was fine.</i>

859
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,951
My dad doesn't actually know
what happened,

860
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,387
and so the fact that she's
gonna act like she, like...

861
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,923
-"Kendall knew. Kendall saw the...
-Yeah.

862
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,691
-She read the script."
-She didn't even... She wouldn't know

863
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,026
-if I had known or not.
-Yeah.

864
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,528
Like, she was not in the works of it,

865
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,364
-or behind the scenes of it at all.
-Yeah.

866
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,901
She has no idea,
and she just, like, word-vomits.

867
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,904
It's like, you're not the person to,
like, have this conversation.

868
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,973
You're gonna make it worse,
so please leave it alone.

869
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,608
-[Kendall] Yeah.
-And they didn't.

870
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,744
[tense music]

871
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,884
I just feel really, really bad.

872
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,054
Like, I feel really bad
that anyone was ever offended.

873
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:14,392
I feel really bad that...
this was taken such a wrong way.

874
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,060
And I genuinely feel like [bleep].

875
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,429
And I have no idea
how I'm gonna bounce back from it.

876
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,332
I don't even know what to do.

877
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,470
[Kim] This is the first time
you've had a scandal.

878
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,373
It's, like, your first...
This is your first real experience

879
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,708
with something like this.

880
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,777
Yeah, but it's a very bad one.

881
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,612
-A very bad one. And, like you were...
-Like, it's not like it's, like...

882
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,881
-...a little scandal that'll, like, go away.
-you were, you were...

883
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,450
[Kim] Like, this is, it's okay.

884
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,986
-Like, people...
-Everyone... Everyone was like...

885
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,022
Every like, the text messages
I would get from people,

886
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,391
they'd be like, "It's gonna be fine, like,

887
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,895
you know, everything blows over
in like, a week's time" or whatever.

888
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,998
And I'm just like,
"Okay, but it's been, like, three weeks

889
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,833
and it's not going anywhere."

890
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,702
[Kim] Yeah, but it will. And...

891
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,873
this is just gonna be
the biggest lesson learned for you.

892
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,644
But I really don't even know
what to do at this point.

893
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:10,114
Like, it's really depressing,
and it bothers me every single day

894
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,182
because I'm like...

895
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,751
-Well, I know you're so sensitive...
-How can I...

896
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,921
...and I know that you never
would have, like, ever...

897
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:20,424
Though you're the last person to want
to hurt someone or be insensitive,

898
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,126
but it's, like, it really sucks.

899
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,996
I think the only thing you can really do
is, like, just be, like, real and honest

900
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,399
because you can't ignore it,
like, you can't.

901
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,003
It should affect you in a way
where you grow from it,

902
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,306
and you're like,
"Okay, I'm a better person from it,

903
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,440
'cause like..."

904
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,377
-Yeah.
-[Kim] You know?

905
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,146
But I just wish that you could see

906
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,914
that there's light
at the end of the tunnel.

907
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,917
-Yeah.
-[Kim] And that it will be okay

908
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,753
if you're just, like, honest and open.

909
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,787
Mm-hm.

910
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,459
[sniffles]

911
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:58,095
[dramatic music]

912
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,564
I would never purposely
hurt someone, ever.

913
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,801
And I would obviously if I knew that this
was gonna be the outcome,

914
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,770
like, I would have never
done something like this.

915
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:09,240
But you... you don't know
when you're in the moment, and, like...

916
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,541
It was the most... Like, it was...

917
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,843
Like, it was so...

918
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,713
Like, I just felt so [bleep] stupid.

919
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,816
The fact that I would offend other people

920
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:22,853
or hurt other people
was definitely not the intent.

921
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,956
{\an8}And that's what,
that's what got me the most,

922
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:29,393
{\an8}is that I would have
ever made anyone else upset.

923
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,263
[Kim] I'm always here.

924
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,864
I've been through it.

925
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,500
[Kendall] I appreciate it a lot.
