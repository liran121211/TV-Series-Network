1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,232
Keeping
Up with the Kardashians...

2
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:12,199
It just sucks it has
to be so public.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,666
I'm not just a TV show.
Like, this is my life.

4
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:21,332
You'll put me down
just to make yourself not look

5
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,733
- lame.
- Moving to Chicago might

6
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:30,233
- be my breaking point.
- My family was ruined!

7
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,399
Here's to Jordyn and Kylie!

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,432
Tristan might love me,

9
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:44,232
whatever that means; He has no
respect for me whatsoever.

10
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:48,666
How many people have

11
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,432
- you been in love with?
- One.

12
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:52,399
I didn't think that I
was gonna have happiness again.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,733
Liar!

14
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:58,499
We just can't seem to
catch a break.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,432
You called me and said
that you were the watchdog.

16
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,566
I just hope that
there's a light at the end of

17
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:06,733
this tunnel, but I don't see it
right now.

18
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,432
- Yeah!
- We're having a baby.

19
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,733
True is the best thing

20
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:16,165
- that's happened to me. Ever.
- It's difficult.

21
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,566
Nothing is private.
Everyone feels like they have

22
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,999
the right to talk about you,
even though they have absolutely

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,399
- no idea what's going on.
- Sometimes the world

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,766
forgets just to be kind and that
we're all going through

25
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:30,766
something.
Maybe just be a little

26
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:35,366
more understanding, 'cause
it sucks.

27
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:40,332
You ready?

28
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,733
Yeah.

29
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:44,599
So, if you want to,
like, look up.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,032
This is my first
time doing this.

31
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:53,232
I'm not actually attempting to
do good, I just...

32
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:57,466
Like, part of the reason why I
even thought about or considered

33
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:01,065
doing this, um... this
recording, like, what do you

34
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,699
call, what do you call... it's
an interview?

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,065
- Interview.
- This interview is.

36
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:06,299
The The...

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,766
- Why?
- It starts off with the

38
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,566
interviews.
The superheroes are giving

39
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:12,299
interviews.
The wife got a big butt, and I

40
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,766
just see our life becoming The

41
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,632
until we can finally fly.

42
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:19,734
What?

43
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,532
Scott, how was it
seeing the Palm Springs house?

44
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,566
- Yeah. Tell us.
- There's, like, a golf

45
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,466
course down there that you can
run the sprinklers.

46
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:52,099
Me and KiKi, and your mom...

47
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,766
- Yeah.
- They used to turn on

48
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:55,666
the sprinklers in Palm Springs
'cause it was so hot, and we

49
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:59,065
would run through them all.
My mom bought a family vacation

50
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,999
home in Palm Springs, and I
think that is so cool.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,599
Our entire childhood we had a
vacation house there.

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,432
We would drive up every weekend,
and we have so many memories in.

53
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,666
Palm Springs, so I think it's
awesome that all the kids get to

54
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:15,065
- have the same kind of memories.
- Come here.

55
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:19,566
Yeah.

56
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:22,666
We have an announcement to make.

57
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:27,399
My God. What?

58
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,466
We're having a baby.

59
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:32,399
- Hey!
- No!

60
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,065
Another one!

61
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:40,632
- We're having a boy.
- I'm so happy for you.

62
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:43,299
Congratulations, you guys.

63
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,132
- My God!
- Are you excited for

64
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:51,566
- your fourth kid?
- Yeah. I'm pleased.

65
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,632
I stopped using the word
"excited."

66
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,566
I'm very happy.

67
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,432
- Yeah.
- I feel like the energy

68
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:01,532
is gonna be really balanced out.
Saint happens to be one of my

69
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,065
- favorite human beings.
- I don't think it's

70
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:06,566
good when, like, parents be
like, "This is my favorite"

71
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,399
- "child."
- I think it changes.

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,366
I mean, it's reality.
I was my mom's favorite for a

73
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,999
- good decade, and now it's Kylie.
- I don't think you

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,366
- should play favorites with kids.
- Well, they would never

75
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,499
- know that, I'm just saying.
- Yeah, they just

76
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,499
- watch this, be like, ""
- But, you guys, it's

77
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,132
really top secret.
We don't want anyone to know

78
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,766
- until it happens.
- We're getting a new

79
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,599
- baby?
- Yeah.

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,766
North! Kiki's getting...

81
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,666
- You're getting another baby!
- I know.

82
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,466
She said, "I know."

83
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:41,033
My God.

84
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,499
You have to show True
the movie with the two dogs that

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,366
eats the spaghetti together.
Lady and the Tramp?

86
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:57,499
Yes! They have a French accent.

87
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,399
You know spaghetti is
more Italian.

88
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,599
They're Italian,
the dogs are Italian.

89
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,632
But they're not.

90
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:08,532
It's been a few months.

91
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:13,566
Me and Tristan are great, and I
am loving being a mommy.

92
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:17,032
It's bittersweet; I love seeing
every milestone with her, but I

93
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:20,032
feel like she grows... like, in
one week she's a completely

94
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,699
- different baby.
- That's all you're

95
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,466
- eating?
- Yeah, I'm so

96
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,599
- anxious, I just can't eat.
- Why are you anxious?

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,499
- Anxious about what?
- Life.

98
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,766
But what are you anxious about?

99
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,499
Yeah, but give us the reason.

100
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,432
I'm just anxious at
all times. I don't know.

101
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,199
My God, who just says that?

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,132
And then I saw
Scott 'cause I go, "I've been"

103
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:37,999
been crying all morning," and
then Scott was like, "You should

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,165
be celebrating that that guy's
out of your life."

105
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,399
- Hear, hear.
- I got out of a

106
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,532
relationship, and have been
feeling a lot of anxiety.

107
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:50,532
When I'm in a relationship,
there's, like, this sense of

108
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:54,065
security, and when I'm single,
it's like, I just don't like the

109
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:57,232
unknown, and I really don't do
well with change.

110
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:00,999
I've been trying doing Reiki to
get rid of some of the bad

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,767
energy, but nothing's really
helping.

112
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,032
Northie, this is Chicago.

113
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:21,432
- This is where Daddy grew up.
- I like the air.

114
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:26,532
You like the air?
Kanye's in Chicago working on

115
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,766
his new album, just working on
so many projects out there, like

116
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:33,599
tech stuff, architecture, his
whole Yeezy office is out

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,632
- there.
- Ha ha.

118
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:40,232
- Who's this pretty girl?
- I am bringing North so

119
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,165
that she can see where her dad
grew up, and he can show us

120
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,165
- around.
- Just so you know,

121
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,165
we're good at 4:30 at the Regal
if you want.

122
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:52,032
Yeah, so, we're, um,
re-refurbishing the Regal, which

123
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:56,232
is a Chicago landmark.
It's like our Apollo and it's on

124
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,699
79th Street, which is the
street I grew up on.

125
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,699
- That's so cool.
- So we can go by the.

126
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,132
Regal, that'd be fire, and then
we can go by my mom's house.

127
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,265
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

128
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:10,466
But you know who we gotta get to
let us in?

129
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:13,299
Kanye decided to start
an organization after his mother

130
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,199
passed away called "Donda's
House" that would really help

131
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,265
the youth in Chicago.
He had his friend, Rhymefest,

132
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:22,699
that he's known for a long time,
head that foundation.

133
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,733
And when Kanye was going through
that tough financial time, he

134
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:30,099
was in debt, and he didn't have
the means to really take care of

135
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,032
it anymore, Rhymefest wanted to
take full responsibility of it,

136
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:38,666
and then all of a sudden...
Rhymefest, you know, was

137
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:44,032
publicly tweeting that Kanye
does nothing for Donda's House.

138
00:07:44,033 --> 00:07:46,232
It's still your house.
He can leave the key.

139
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,566
We don't need to see his face.
You don't want me to see him.

140
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,632
Well, we got love, babe.

141
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,632
I'm letting you know.
I... You got love.

142
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:56,099
I-I don't have all the love.
My problem that I had with.

143
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,299
Rhymefest is that he was using
your mom to talk you and

144
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,699
that's where I drew the line.
He was saying, "You have failed."

145
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,332
Donda's House."
Your mother's name.

146
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,532
He didn't respect it, so

147
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:18,533
I was being protective.
I tweeted.

148
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,099
But you know why he
did it, though?

149
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,733
- Why?
- I had an assistant

150
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:26,999
that was rude to Rhymefest.
We were connecting.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,666
- No.
- No, let me finish what

152
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,232
I'm saying.
Because we were connecting and

153
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:35,366
bonding, and he came to the
studio with me, then this person

154
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:40,099
that worked with me was
extremely rude to him...

155
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,099
Come on. Come on.
One of my sister's assistants...

156
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,666
- Yeah.
- Was rude to me.

157
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,566
I don't say anything.

158
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,199
I don't feel a way.
I don't start tweeting.

159
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,766
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I don't start going

160
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,999
crazy about my sister.
If Rhymefest is your boy that

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,666
you grew up with and knows your
mom...

162
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,632
I'm not saying his
reaction was called for.

163
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:58,232
Then I would call and be
like, "What the is wrong"

164
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,366
with your assistant?
She was so rude to me."

165
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,699
I would just never start
tweeting, "You won't give me"

166
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:09,666
money for da da da da da."
That is some serious...

167
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:13,299
disturbed.
For real, you can walk up, you

168
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,199
can say hi.
I'm gonna zoom in and write some

169
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,699
- foul on, over his Face.
- See, that's some...

170
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,632
- On Snapchat.
- That's not what we're

171
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,566
- gonna do.
- That's what I'm gonna

172
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,433
do.

173
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,699
- Hello?!
- I'm so excited!

174
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,132
This house is crazy.
Everyone clap.

175
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,032
I don't have time for this.

176
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,199
- It's too much.
- I just want to know,

177
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,232
what's your rationale in being
cool with him?

178
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:45,065
- He's not gonna bully me.
- Bullying?

179
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:46,766
- Ain't nobody bullying me.
- I'm not saying he is.

180
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:53,700
Yeah. I get what you're saying.

181
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,632
We're painting fake abs.

182
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:06,232
- Trying to keep up with you.
- That's awesome.

183
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:10,232
- I gotta go, babe.
- Love you, bye.

184
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,065
Wow. Nice. Very nice, Khloe.

185
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,065
Am I making them big
enough for you?

186
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,265
I need to sell a sports bra
here, people.

187
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:20,699
Hey. What are you doing?

188
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,999
Just a Good American
photo shoot.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,332
Just got out of the shower.

190
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,199
- I'm going to do a call with GQ.
- Fabulous, darling.

191
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,699
Wait, so can you tell me what's
going on with Palm Springs?

192
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,999
Kim can't come
'cause she's in Chicago.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,733
- So there's like 14 of us.
- Isn't this like a

194
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,699
really, like, bougie
neighborhood?

195
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,099
- Yeah.
- I was gonna say,

196
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,666
"Can we TP people's houses?" but
we might get kicked of the

197
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,999
- community.
- Yeah, Mom will kill

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,299
- us.
- The Kardashians are

199
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,032
- here!
- We should do.

200
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:52,132
- Connect Four.
- Now you're just

201
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:56,165
getting a little too wild.
Connect Four. Whoa.

202
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,999
Since Kourtney's dealing with
anxiety, we all figured why

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,432
don't we have a fun, really
light girls weekend?

204
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:06,165
Let's go to Palm Springs, have
fun and check out the new digs

205
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,466
that Kris Jenner got.
I want Kourtney to enjoy being

206
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:13,232
single and focus on her.
No kids, no responsibilities,

207
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:15,432
- just let her hair down.
- Tomorrow will be

208
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,299
fun. Have a good shoot.

209
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Toodle-oo.

210
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:30,032
- Hello.
- Hi, there.

211
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,999
I wanted to come, mwah, see you.

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,766
Why do you have these little
coasters everywhere?

213
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:37,299
- 'Cause I want to.
- Lot of stuff on this

214
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,332
- table, lot of little stuff.
- Don't worry about it.

215
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,733
MJ's been living in
Calabasas for a while now, and

216
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:46,432
it's really great.
I can pop in and see her on my

217
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:50,132
way in, on my way out, of
anything I do, make sure she's

218
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,099
okay and that makes me feel
really good.

219
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,265
I do have one thing for
you, though.

220
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:57,165
This is the other part of our
genealogy.

221
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,366
- Okay.
- So this is the Wyatt part

222
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,132
of the family, you know, like
Grandma's mother.

223
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,766
And Walter Wyatt, which

224
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:05,400
- was Grandma's...
- Wait, hold on.

225
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,133
Cute boots.

226
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:23,432
So, are we through with this?

227
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:27,232
All right, Mom, I love you.
I'm going over to Kourtney's.

228
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,299
You're always in a big hurry..

229
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,099
I love you. Mwah.
I love you very much.

230
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,432
- I love you.
- Mwah.

231
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:37,066
You be good.

232
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,099
Kourtney, I hope
you know that these are what

233
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,165
real friends do.
They go on a trip with you when

234
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,099
- you're single.
- Thanks.

235
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,165
No one else in this
car is single, so we're doing

236
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,599
this for you.
This is a support system.

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,466
Well, you know what, guys?

238
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,499
I appreciate you enjoying my
singleness with me.

239
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,232
Thank you so much.

240
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,766
Thank you so much for being
single.

241
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:03,099
- Yes, thank you.
- And thank you, Mom,

242
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,432
- for the house in Palm Springs.
- Yes.

243
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:12,467
Hello?! Hi!

244
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:27,165
- I'm so excited!
- I knew my mom bought a

245
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,599
gorgeous house in Palm Springs,
I don't think I imagined just

246
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,132
- how spectacular a house.
- I don't think you

247
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:35,199
- can call it a "house."
- It is breathtaking.

248
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,399
I'm really excited that all you
guys are here because Kourtney,

249
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,165
I think, really needs to, like,
get away, it's her trip, and

250
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,399
she's been super, like, anxious
lately, but I think she's now

251
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,332
single, and even though it's
not, like, some wild vacation, I

252
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,165
just think it's fun that we're
all doing a girls trip.

253
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,232
- Girl-guys trip.
- You can live,

254
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,366
there's life after that
relationship.

255
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,466
I just like that
she's, like, getting out and

256
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,432
about. It's fun.

257
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:02,099
My... Kourtney? My God!

258
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,166
That's that single body.
There's the breakup body!

259
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,032
Mommy, this should be for you.

260
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,199
Thank you. Hey, hey, now.

261
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,399
What does she want?

262
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,366
My gosh.
Look at those huge lollipops.

263
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,599
- Are we gonna go see your house?
- Yeah.

264
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,132
I need to get the keys and all
that, everything.

265
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:35,065
You should be able to
walk right in there without his

266
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:36,599
permission. It's your home.

267
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,332
- He's not gonna bully me.
- He's not gonna bully

268
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,599
me, either. What you mean?

269
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,165
- Why you say it like that?
- 'Cause I'm saying, like,

270
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,132
he's not gonna be nice and
we all got love, I get it all,

271
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,432
- but I don't...
- Nah, but you said

272
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:51,232
bullying.
Ain't nobody bullying me.

273
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:54,199
I'm not saying he is.
He's acting like, he's not gonna

274
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,432
like, talk, keep talking
to me on Twitter.

275
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,065
- Like, he's not gonna...
- Yeah.

276
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,734
I get what you're saying.

277
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:11,532
I just want to know
what's your rationale in being

278
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,366
- cool with him?
- I'm not rational.

279
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:16,099
- I'm spiritual.
- Okay, but do you

280
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,532
- understand that, like...
- Spirit is love.

281
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,399
That's so hard to, like...

282
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,432
- Spirit is love.
- Yeah.

283
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,165
You know I'm about forgiveness.

284
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:27,699
You know, I'm on that Buddha
you know?

285
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,666
Well, I think that, you
know, we definitely...

286
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:35,099
I see where you're coming from
and I want to be as good a

287
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,232
- person as you are, but...
- You want to be mad at

288
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,632
somebody.
You just want to be mad at

289
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,432
- anybody.
- No, I don't, I just get

290
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,733
really protective and I'm like,
"No."

291
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,466
And then you just go forgive
them.

292
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,132
How many times is this gonna
happen with you two?

293
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,132
Forgive people forever.

294
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:49,699
They... with love, they will
grow.

295
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,533
So wack.

296
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,366
We literally
broke up the day before.

297
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,199
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I know Kourtney's

298
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,666
going through something, but
let's focus on what's happening

299
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:08,632
- now.
- This sucks.

300
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,566
- Rhymefest is coming.
- Yeah, I don't like

301
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:11,733
- negativity.
- Yeah.

302
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:13,632
I can't get the door, will you

303
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:17,499
get it? It's your friend.

304
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,333
Yo.

305
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,165
I'm letting you open the
door like a gentleman.

306
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,699
Get me some points on

307
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,366
I've always felt a special bond

308
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:39,232
with MJ over the years.
She's so quick in her wit, like,

309
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,032
I just feel like we get each
other.

310
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,232
So, I found this really, really
cute little tea place.

311
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:46,466
I felt like it would be the
perfect little date for her and.

312
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,532
I. This is unbelievable, this

313
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,499
- little spot.
- The decor is so cute.

314
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,332
I can't believe this
even exists.

315
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,599
I think we should come
back and get really dressed up.

316
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,532
I do, too.
We could wear the fancy cos...

317
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,466
- 'Cause you have award clothes.
- Yeah, I would have to

318
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:01,332
- wear a tux or a suit.
- Do you still have your...

319
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,766
- Of course I do.
- Plaid pants and...

320
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,432
- I've got it all.
- Then cool.

321
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:05,766
We should get really
decked out and come.

322
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:07,432
We should. I have a great hat.

323
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:10,299
Yeah, okay.

324
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,499
So, have you adapted fully?
From living in San Diego to.

325
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,699
Calabasas?

326
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,632
When Kris started moving all my
stuff, I had pneumonia, so I was

327
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,632
kind of at a... She scooped in.

328
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:24,399
She knows when to get you.

329
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,265
It's like if they took
your house and said, "We're"

330
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:29,632
gonna make this better, Scott,
just stand by."

331
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,265
And they moved
everything to a new house...

332
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:32,632
But I was already happy.

333
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,399
Yeah. But you know what I really

334
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,299
resent?
She'd say, "Let's go to the"

335
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,032
"mall," and she's like this the
whole time.

336
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,733
So I resent that.
I thought, "Why are we going to"

337
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:42,466
- "lunch?"
- What's the point?

338
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,999
- Yeah.
- MJ moved all the way

339
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,532
to Calabasas to be around
everybody, but everybody's so

340
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,566
busy, she probably feels like
she's being swept under the

341
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,632
carpet and not really getting
a lot of time with people.

342
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,632
- I get where she's coming from.
- You eat cereal?

343
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:56,999
- No.
- Why?

344
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,666
We'll, like, have
scrambled eggs or something...

345
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,332
I love scrambled eggs.

346
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,666
- Not more than that.
- Yeah.

347
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,399
I remember the only
thing my dad could cook was

348
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,666
- scrambled eggs.
- That's so cute.

349
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,399
That was the only
thing I ever remember...

350
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,666
Well, then you should learn it.

351
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,599
I kind of have someone
who does it.

352
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,399
Well... I believe in
doing things yourself.

353
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,299
All right, I'll learn
how to do scrambled eggs this

354
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,466
week. Can you teach me?

355
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,065
- Yeah.
- All right, so, let's

356
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,399
do it. This week, you

357
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,099
- teach me how to do scramble...
- I'll show you how to

358
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,666
- whisk them.
- All you got to do is

359
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,099
- crack it open and...
- Right?

360
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,734
- Yeah.
- All right.

361
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:39,599
- I love your outfit!
- Thank you!

362
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,699
Thank you.
Even though it's been kind of a

363
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,332
- rocky day...
- What's good, man?

364
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,699
Respect, respect. Respect.

365
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,733
- Love. Love.
- I know that Kanye's

366
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:51,699
been really excited about this
theater he wants to renovate.

367
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,499
- That's it. Got it.
- Cool.

368
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,599
So I'm excited to go see it
with him.

369
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,466
This is my favorite part.

370
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,499
Shine a light up in here, you
can see the jewels that are on

371
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,099
- the ceiling.
- Ooh, there's jewels on

372
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,599
- the ceiling.
- Largest flying

373
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,599
carpet, yeah.
All of these murals depict

374
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,599
scenes from King Arthur.
And that's actually Avalon

375
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,132
'cause this was built as the
Avalon Theater in 1927.

376
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,632
Transitioned into the new Regal
Theater in 1997.

377
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,999
- Mom, when are we...
- Wait, let's listen, he's

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,999
- telling us about what it means.
- What if we changed it

379
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,599
changed it back to the Avalon?
I love that name.

380
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,566
So, dig this, I'm
changing it to the Avalon Regal.

381
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:24,733
Theater because it spells "art."

382
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:27,599
- Art. Incredible.
- Can you dig it?

383
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,733
- >> KANYE and JERALD: Yeah.
- This is a really cool

384
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:33,532
theater where a lot of artists
would perform in Chicago.

385
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:36,499
I opened up for Jay-Z
at the Regal Theater.

386
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,366
That's so cool.

387
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,332
It's really beautiful to be able
to give back to the community

388
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,499
- that helped make me who I am.
- It's fire, right?

389
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,532
If you guys can, like,
redo this, it'll be really cool

390
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:53,700
- for the whole city.
- Yeah.

391
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,599
Hi, Mama.

392
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,666
How are you? Baby True.

393
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:10,632
I love you, Mama.
Have fun on your walk with your

394
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:14,199
cousins.
Mwah, mwah, mwah. Bye, boo.

395
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,065
My God, are you so obsessed?

396
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,099
- I'm so obsessed.
- We literally broke

397
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,566
- up the day before.
- Right.

398
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,532
And the next day,
that's how you're gonna go act?

399
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:23,399
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like, I don't have

400
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,432
time for this.
And it just was too much.

401
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,766
- And I was like...
- Too much.

402
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,532
That was another
too much and then it just was so

403
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:32,499
- many too muches.
- This sucks.

404
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,366
What the?
I know Kourtney's upset, but I

405
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,566
wish she would be in the moment
more and realize that she

406
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,766
doesn't need to be in a
relationship to be happy.

407
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:43,399
Let's focus on what's happening
now.

408
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,032
Kourtney!
Let me tell you, get your fat

409
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,132
ass over here.

410
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,165
My God! What?

411
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,766
We need a blow-

412
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:57,066
- dryer!
- What do I do?

413
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,399
- Hey.
- Hey.

414
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,466
- What are you doing?
- Just eating dinner.

415
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:12,599
Is North having fun?

416
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,132
Yeah, she's having...
She always has, like, so much

417
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:17,666
fun when it's just us.
She, like, loves it, you know?

418
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,466
- Yeah.
- You know, tomorrow

419
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:23,566
morning we're gonna go see the
house that Kanye grew up in.

420
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,999
- That's cool.
- Yeah, it's cool, but he

421
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,032
bought it in the foundation name
and then gave the foundation to

422
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:35,132
his friend Rhymefest, that I
cussed out on Twitter.

423
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,699
- Dear.
- And I'm just, like, so

424
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,999
annoyed because he just, like,
lets all of his, like, friends

425
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,265
back in that, like, always
publicly talk about him

426
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:48,099
and it's like, I've just never,
I've just never dealt with close

427
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,065
people like that.
Those are like his brothers, you

428
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:53,265
- know?
- Yeah.

429
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:56,099
But the fact that you're back
there and you're trying to

430
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,466
figure it out, I think it's
amazing that you support him and

431
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:01,065
you want to show your daughter
his world.

432
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:04,132
Well, that's why, that's
what I do on a daily is to

433
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:06,699
protect him, and then I get
stuck in this, like, circle

434
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,499
because I'm like, "I got to take
care of the kids, I got to",

435
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,132
like, work."
I have, like, so much to do that

436
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:17,599
I can't, like, babysit him
and figure out, like, who's

437
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,532
him over today and who
he's gonna forgive.

438
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:23,165
Like, I just don't have the
energy for it.

439
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,699
- It's, it's a lot.
- Yeah.

440
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,499
- It's so draining.
- I know.

441
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,265
I mean, you can have all
the love in the world and want

442
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:34,599
to wish everyone well, but it is
so frustrating to me to just see

443
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,599
him not care and let people,
like, walk all over him.

444
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,666
- So, I don't know what to do.
- Forgiveness is an

445
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,132
amazing thing.

446
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,599
- Yeah.
- I'll figure it out.

447
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,199
Okay, well, I'll be here.

448
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,666
All right, I love you. Bye.

449
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:55,733
All right, I love you, too. Bye.

450
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:58,032
You guys, someone save me!

451
00:22:58,033 --> 00:23:00,999
Everyone drove up here
all for Kourtney and so we are

452
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,733
gonna just have a ball.

453
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:10,632
You won't even talk to me.

454
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:14,232
You go, "Mom, this is business."
I thought, "Couldn't I have

455
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:22,233
20 minutes alone with her?"
But I don't.

456
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,666
I don't know your stove.

457
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,599
- Same.
- Just like any stove?

458
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,999
- All right.
- I have to say yes,

459
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,299
but...

460
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,599
I really don't know
how to make much.

461
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,232
I thought it was literally the
nicest, cutest thing that MJ

462
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:42,999
actually wanted to take her time
and teach me how to cook some

463
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,099
- things.
- Crack us four eggs in

464
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,366
- there.
- I've seen this done,

465
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:51,399
but I...

466
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,733
- There. You did it.
- I'm done.

467
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:55,766
- Here, put this here.
- I knew I had talent.

468
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,032
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

469
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:00,599
Here, like this. Get under it.

470
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,766
Wow!

471
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:04,366
Why haven't you learned this?

472
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:07,299
I'll tell you the
exact reason, I'm a man.

473
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,299
- I'm not sitting in the kitchen.
- That's, that's very

474
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,032
- sexist.
- Listen, I do a lot for

475
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,100
women and people and humanity.

476
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,232
You turned off the stove, right?

477
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:22,199
No.

478
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,133
Beautiful. I'm an egg maker.

479
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,199
- Hello.
- Hi. Where are you?

480
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,632
- I'm at Scott's.
- Wait a second, I have

481
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:36,132
- to look at something.
- She calls just to...

482
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:39,366
- You called me. Hello?
- Hi, just a second.

483
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:42,766
No, no, no, no.
You can't do that.

484
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:44,265
- Hello?
- She's not even

485
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:46,132
- listening.
- She's not even on the

486
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:48,165
- phone.
- I can totally

487
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:50,065
understand now what MJ's talking
about.

488
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:52,366
This is crazy.
I mean, it's her mom.

489
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,999
- Go forth, my dear.
- I don't know what's

490
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,432
happening over there, but I feel
like you don't want to hang

491
00:24:57,433 --> 00:24:59,099
- out with me.
- Well...

492
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,733
You're literally
always on your phone.

493
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:03,165
Nice, Scott. Okay.

494
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,065
Do you want go with us to

495
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:06,632
- our favorite hangout?
- What?

496
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:09,399
- What's your hangout, Mom?
- The Cottage Tea Room.

497
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,733
That's so cute.
I would love to come with you.

498
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:13,265
Be sure to dress up, though.

499
00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:14,699
She better start
getting ready now.

500
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,332
You better call your
makeup people right now.

501
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,332
My God. All right, you guys.

502
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,099
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

503
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,432
- Bye.
- I don't think there's

504
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:26,399
any way Kris is gonna be able to
sit through a whole tea without

505
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,399
using her phone.

506
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,165
I can't wait to see how
long it takes.

507
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:33,999
- Should we bet on that?
- Two minutes.

508
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,232
I'm going five.
You're going two?

509
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:39,332
Yeah. Two.

510
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:44,199
You guys, you're

511
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,499
- not ready for this.
- Hold on.

512
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,132
- A boom box?
- Okay, let's set it up.

513
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:51,265
Let's start singing and our
voices will get them to come in.

514
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:54,265
The fact that there's a
karaoke machine, it's, of

515
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:58,132
course, Kris Jenner style.
My mom is the queen of drunk

516
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:01,133
karaoke.

517
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,399
Coming in hot!
Coming in hot, people!

518
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,265
What's going on?
I heard the karaoke.

519
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:11,099
I mean, I know
Kourtney's going through

520
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,099
something.

521
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,432
You guys, someone save me!

522
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:18,065
I'm forcing Kourtney
to have fun right now, so she

523
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:21,032
sees that she can be single and
it's okay.

524
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:24,099
- Just have a ball.
- Odis!

525
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:30,466
Odis!

526
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:33,199
- We're doing karaoke.
- Ooh, can we do.

527
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,165
- "CoCo"?
- Can we do "CoCo"?

528
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,199
- Word.
- A thousand bitches

529
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,333
have never sang your song for
you, watch!

530
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:46,032
I'm in love with the
coco, coco...

531
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:47,432
There's a mic on the floor.

532
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:50,232
I'm in love with the
coco, coco...

533
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,165
- Hey!

534
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:56,699

539
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:10,032

00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:16,199
Hey, hey!

541
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,199

542
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,032
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

543
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:27,165
I needed that.
Thanks for coming, you guys.

544
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,499
- Yeah.
- May you stay single

545
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,532
long enough for us to do this
at least one more time.

546
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:33,233
Very well, guys.

547
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:54,366
Northie, look at the water.

548
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:56,399
I just saw a dolphin jump.

549
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,032
- You did?
- Yeah.

550
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:04,466
The one, like, sentiment

551
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:08,332
that I really want to get
across... like, I hope you know

552
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:12,566
when I talk about your friends,
you don't have anyone else

553
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:16,532
around to protect you.
So, I feel like I have to double

554
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:21,099
watch everything,
so when I... it comes from a

555
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,199
different perspective.
I'm not, like, being a hater,

556
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,466
- I'm, like... like you think I am.
- Nah, I didn't... I-I

557
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:29,299
never... I never thought you were
a hater.

558
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,399
I thought you were doing what
you felt, and I think that it

559
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,532
shows that you care.
And I... and I appreciate

560
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:39,165
- you for having that perspective.
- Thank you.

561
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:42,132
- Yeah.
- My favorite thing about.

562
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:48,032
Kanye is that he is a completely
free thinker.

563
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:49,332
Yeah, that's beautiful.

564
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,332
I wanted you to be like, "Man,
you know, his is bomb,"

565
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:55,232
no.

566
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,099
No, um, I think it's
just good that he hears

567
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,332
me out and we're having this
conversation.

568
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:04,065
I think it's gonna shape the way
that he deals with his friends,

569
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:08,132
but I know that Kanye is always
gonna be Kanye and I'm never

570
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:10,032
trying to change that.
I mean, that's who I fell in

571
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,466
- love with.
- Who's your favorite

572
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:15,566
husband?

573
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:21,399
You.
Next time Rhymefest is in L.A.,

574
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,165
I'd love to sit down with him
and talk face-to-face.

575
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:27,165
Yeah. Yeah, here we are.

576
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,532
Pull up right here, stop, stop,
stop.

577
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,566
- This right here.
- Where are we going,

578
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:34,065
- Daddy?
- This one right here.

579
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:37,632
Look at the hearts, North.

580
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:40,432
So there used to be
ch... cherries on this tree,

581
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:43,299
or grapes.
I remember being back here when

582
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,599
the Reebok Pumps and the
Nike Pumps came out, explaining

583
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,632
to my friends how the pump
technology work.

584
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,599
I ain't have no idea, I would
just be like, "Yo, and see",

585
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,532
"when you pump it, then you drive
fast," you know, how, like,

586
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:57,199
kids, like...
"Or you run extra fast when you

587
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,566
- "pump it up."
- It's so special that.

588
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:05,099
North gets to see that life that
Kanye lived that really made

589
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,499
- him who he is.
- I love you, Northie.

590
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,399
That was really cool to see.

591
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,432
Wait, can someone take a pic of
me with them?

592
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:14,099
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

593
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:21,132
How cool is this?

594
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:22,466
Thought we was friends.

595
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,632
You can't make
positive by doing negative.

596
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:26,466
Kanye is from a village.

597
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:34,467
Our dear brother turned his back
on the village.

598
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,199
This is the life, Kourt.

599
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,532
So good. My... it's so hot, I'm

600
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,566
dying.

601
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,299
What? A bee? Ooh.

602
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,632
- My God.
- Move.

603
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:58,132
My God.

604
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:01,466
I swear to God, was

605
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:04,466
- that not the biggest bee?
- No, it legit was about

606
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:05,999
- to attack you.
- Was that a huge

607
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,199
- bumblebee?
- Yeah. I've never seen

608
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,733
- you move that fast.
- It was literally

609
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,265
- trying to kill me.
- You are hilarious, I

610
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:14,566
- swear.
- My God.

611
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:16,499
Those are, like, the bees that
you die from, right?

612
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,299
- I don't know.
- The bees you die from?

613
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,199
There are some,
they... aren't they called killer

614
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,532
- bees?
- I don't know if

615
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:24,633
that means they're gonna kill
you.

616
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,599
I feel so much better, I've been
feeling so anxious.

617
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,399
- Yeah.
- But now I feel... I

618
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,733
feel like I needed this trip to
get away.

619
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:39,532
I love that we have this house
now.

620
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,599
I am the kind of

621
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,399
person... I feel like I'm usually
better when I'm in a

622
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,733
relationship, but I feel good.

623
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:50,766
It's almost like...
It's an anxiety, but it's also,

624
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:52,999
like, an excitement.
It's not necessarily...

625
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,733
- Like, the new chapter?
- At some moments,

626
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:57,532
it's...
I feel like, you know, I-I've

627
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:00,599
feel like I've gone through
already, like, the sad and

628
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,399
- the... like, I feel good.
- Yeah.

629
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,399
I feel happy, I
feel like this is where I'm

630
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,199
meant to be.
I don't have regrets.

631
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,432
- Yeah.
- I feel like I gave

632
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:14,332
it my 100%.

633
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,466
I'm feeling much
better and, you know, as scary

634
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:19,999
as this might be, I'm really
ready.

635
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,532
It's kind of like, God has a
plan and just trusting.

636
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:26,366
This is the first time I've
really been single in a long

637
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:31,332
time, so I'm just going to
embrace it and really enjoy the

638
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:35,733
time to myself and focusing on
my kids and myself.

639
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:39,299
I'm excited for the future.

640
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,532
I mean, I feel like,
from the looks of everything,

641
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:44,032
the breakup blues are nowhere
in sight.

642
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:46,632
- What breakup blues?
- It worked!

643
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,532
What a trip, guys.

644
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,299
- That was...
- So fun.

645
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
- So fun.
- That was so fun.

646
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,532
Hello.
We're here with a vengeance.

647
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,466
- How are you?
- Welcome back.

648
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,299
- You're looking dapper today.
- Yeah.

649
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,599
- You told us to dress up.
- My goodness, the style.

650
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,666
- Thank you.
- Got you the best table.

651
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,566
- Very excited.
- This is so great.

652
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:26,265
- Do you love it?
- I love it.

653
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:27,766
Where does everybody
want to sit?

654
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:30,299
Let's get this party started.

655
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,699
MJ, you look marvelous.

656
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,599
- Well, thank you, darling.
- Wow.

657
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,366
- Thank you so much.
- See, this is what we

658
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:39,733
- should be doing with our time.
- Enjoying each other.

659
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:41,733
- Yeah.
- I'm so glad you could

660
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:44,999
just settle down and spend some
time with us, and we agreed that

661
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,766
we're all gonna put our phones
in a pile and not touch them.

662
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:51,332
- Got it.
- So remember which is

663
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,999
- yours.
- The one that rings.

664
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,532
Who knew this is what

665
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:58,532
you and MJ have been up to all
this time?

666
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:00,532
I have to dress it up for her.

667
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:02,766
You do.
I take you out and you're in

668
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:07,366
sweats and a hoodie, but for MJ,
you pull out all the stops.

669
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:09,332
- Yes, all the stops.
- Yeah.

670
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,499
I'm a little jealous
that you guys hang out together.

671
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,432
- I'm not gonna lie.
- Well, you're always

672
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:15,132
invited, you're just always too
busy.

673
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:17,099
We can't take you
anywhere, that's why.

674
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,032
She does bring up a good point.

675
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:21,399
We were worried you were gonna
do business.

676
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,466
I'm not trying to say
poor me, but... poor me.

677
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:26,399
Yeah, I'll say it for you.

678
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,065
I think MJ's just excited to
have some quality time with you.

679
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:32,399
- Absolutely.
- And I think, you know,

680
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,065
she hasn't really vocalized it
enough, but I think she felt

681
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:40,666
like you kind of moved her life
to be closer, and then she kind

682
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:42,499
- of feels like...
- While I had pneumonia.

683
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,332
You don't even have time...

684
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,065
- Aw, Mom.
- When you're here

685
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:48,499
for her and she sometimes
doesn't understand why did I

686
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,032
just move my whole life if
you're not gonna spend the time

687
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:53,499
that you thought you were gonna
be able to spend with her?

688
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,699
I can't, I can't talk to you.

689
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,766
You go, "Mom, this is business."
And you won't even talk to me,

690
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:03,532
and I thought, "Good, I have
20 minutes alone with her," but

691
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:08,065
- I don't.
- I didn't realize that.

692
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:11,432
MJ feels like I don't pay
attention to her.

693
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:14,632
- That's like time-shaming.
- Time-shaming.

694
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:18,733
You guys heard of
time-sharing? Time-shaming.

695
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:20,766
It makes me really,
really sad that she...

696
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:22,599
- Aw.
- Thinks I don't give

697
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,566
- her enough attention.
- Yeah. I think you try.

698
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:29,499
I have to try harder. I get it.

699
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,567
I know you do.

700
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:44,499
Kimberly.
I'm in your house, ready to go.

701
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,165
Hi. How are you?

702
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:51,199
Okay. Okay, so I...

703
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,532
- So I, so I like one.
- Okay.

704
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:55,566
A lot.
You already... You know the ones

705
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:57,566
- you like?
- Yeah.

706
00:35:57,567 --> 00:36:00,132
This one, I feel like I got to
smell.

707
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:04,999
I feel like it has potential.

708
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,999
What we found online is
that this ML, this looks

709
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,065
obviously better, like, on your
counter.

710
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:12,666
And I feel like it's

711
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,766
even cuter for people to take
pics like this, like...

712
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,699
- Yeah. That's...
- And it'll actually fit.

713
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,132
This one, like, is more of a
joke, you know?

714
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,165
Cute. Let's just go
with the small one.

715
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:26,165
Wait, I want to show you
something.

716
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:28,699
- Ooh!
- There's the strong

717
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,632
- heartbeat right there.
- Isn't that crazy?

718
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:35,999
Wow. That is so exciting.

719
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,099
I'm low-key freaking out.

720
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,032
- Why?
- I didn't think it was

721
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,999
gonna, like, happen.
I thought, like, "It

722
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,766
probably won't even take, so,
like, who cares?"

723
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:46,466
You know? We'll try it.
And now that it is, the two

724
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:48,566
little ones are gonna be a year
apart.

725
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:50,566
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna tell

726
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:52,699
any of my friends.
I'm gonna tell your friends

727
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,099
'cause your friends are the ones
that keep it quiet, so I'm not

728
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,032
gonna... if I have to tell
anyone, I'm gonna call your

729
00:36:57,033 --> 00:36:58,566
- friends.
- Yeah, of course.

730
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:00,766
Do you know who I think
our informant is?

731
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:02,699
North.

732
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,699
What do you mean?
She tells everybody?

733
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,566
She appar... A mom at
school texts me and goes,

734
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:10,699
"Congrats, I heard you're having
a baby brother," and I go,

735
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,165
"What?"
And I go, "That," and she

736
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,566
goes, "Yeah, North is going
around saying she finally has a"

737
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,666
baby brother so Saint won't
bother her anymore."

738
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,566
- Stop.
- "And I was like,"

739
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:23,432
that's just her dream. Hahaha."
And, like, she's the one

740
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:27,099
- this whole time.
- Stop. That is crazy.

741
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,699
- What're you gonna do?
- I mean, nothing.

742
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,599
- I mean, I-I killed it.
- I'm just kidding.

743
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,065
- I'm just...
- No, but I killed the

744
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:39,632
rumor.

745
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:43,666
Do you have some

746
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:46,499
scissors?
And I need a cube of butter and

747
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,132
- your rolling pin.
- I got it, I'm your

748
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,099
sous chef. Here you go, madame.

749
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,232
Hi, MJ!

750
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:54,666
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

751
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:56,599
Look at you in your Burberry.

752
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,499
We're making cheesecake.

753
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,099
- Beautiful, beautiful.
- This brings back a lot of

754
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,632
memories. Does it?

755
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:06,099
- Yeah.
- You're so cute, MJ.

756
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,733
I feel like you like it when we
spend time together.

757
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:11,032
- I do love it.
- Sometimes I'm running

758
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,733
around and I'm trying to figure
out, like, running here, running

759
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:16,232
there, working, filming, and you
forget that I...

760
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:18,666
- You are busy.
- Well, I don't mean to

761
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:21,165
- be, like, I want to give you...
- Well, I think you mean to

762
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,232
- be.
- I think one-on-one time

763
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:25,599
and being present in the moment
is really important.

764
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,666
- Very important.
- I love being present.

765
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,366
What is this stool you
have in your kitchen?

766
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:31,999
- Is it good on your knees?
- This is how I go if I

767
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,999
need to go from, like, pot to
pot.

768
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,699
- I need that.
- Ta!

769
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,532
I never want my mom to
think I'm not paying attention

770
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:42,232
to her because if my kids did
that to me, I would be

771
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:44,566
devastated.
I just want to make sure she

772
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:47,766
knows I'm pulled in so many
different directions and I'm

773
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:51,165
just doing the best I can and I
never want her to feel anything

774
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:54,032
but loved. La, la, la, la...

775
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,265
- My sandal.
- La, la, la, la.

776
00:38:56,266 --> 00:39:01,366
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

777
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:08,165
Not even... Whoa!

778
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:11,232
You know, I'm really
happy that Rhymefest is coming.

779
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:14,399
I'm like, definitely in a more
calm place then I was when we

780
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,332
were in Chicago, where I feel
like, "I'm gonna slap this... I'm"

781
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:20,299
gonna punch him in the face."
Like, I'm just way more Zen now.

782
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,332
Yeah, I just want him
to know that we're talking about

783
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:27,366
this, so it's not just another
public thing that just...

784
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,199
brings it up again in, like,

785
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,566
a negative way, 'cause I don't
like negativity.

786
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:33,265
Yeah. I can't get the door.

787
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,733
Will you get it?
It's your friend.

788
00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:40,065
Yo.

789
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,699
- What's good, bro?
- What up?

790
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,265
- Good. Chillin'.
- Hello.

791
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:44,733
- Hi.
- Hey, hey.

792
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:46,733
- How are you?
- Good, good, good.

793
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:49,099
Good to see you.
You want me to sit right

794
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,699
- here?
- Yeah, wherever.

795
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:59,132
Um... when we came to Chicago,
I was really angry, so I just

796
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:02,599
think we should have a
conversation about it, so that

797
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,032
all of our sides are out there
and it's just really fair.

798
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:07,733
I agree. Heal-Healing.

799
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:12,766
- It's for healing. Yeah, yeah.
- So, from my perspective,

800
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:17,065
I grew up with all the same
friends being my same best

801
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:19,466
friends from when I was in
preschool.

802
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:23,466
Not one of my friends has ever
spoken out about me.

803
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:25,466
He can't really say no to
people.

804
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,733
If they ask him financial
questions, if they ask him for

805
00:40:28,734 --> 00:40:33,232
any kind of help and, sometimes,
I think it's, like, to a fault

806
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:37,366
where he'll hurt himself and
then he won't have something

807
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:40,199
- financially and he's struggling.
- Well, I-I-I just

808
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,199
want to, I-I want to, um, make
it clear, um...

809
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,632
Nah, it wasn't about money.
It's, it is deeper than that

810
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:48,999
- because-because we are friends.
- Okay.

811
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,165
Kanye wanted me to
help work on the album, and I

812
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,666
said, "Yeah, I'll help work,"
and he said, "Well, what do you

813
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,065
want?"
And it wasn't about money.

814
00:40:57,066 --> 00:41:01,366
It was like, "Yo, I want you to
tweet out what we're doing about."

815
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:03,733
Donda's House."
And I kept telling you, "Kanye,

816
00:41:03,734 --> 00:41:06,432
I need you to do this.
Come on, we got to do that, do

817
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:09,999
this."
Kanye is from a village and-and

818
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,466
the village was feeling like our
dear brother...

819
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:17,299
You know what I'm saying?
Turned his back on the village.

820
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,132
And so, I struck out.
It's-it's 'cause me and you have

821
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:22,165
- been talking about peace.
- You can't make

822
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,999
positive by doing negative.
You could've said, "Hey, can I"

823
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,666
call you?
I want to just talk to you

824
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:29,265
"directly before I say something,
you know."

825
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:32,099
I just think if Kanye
said, like, "I can't deal with."

826
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,666
"Donda's House right now," to me,
that means in all capacities.

827
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:38,299
Yeah, but that was
after he said he would.

828
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,132
But even if I said I would...

829
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:41,699
That's what I didn't know.

830
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,232
I was going through some.

831
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:46,499
Yeah, but it was all negative.

832
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,499
Yeah, the I
was going through, that's why

833
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,699
it's called going through some
'cause it's negative.

834
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,199
What you talking about?

835
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,265
You guys can go through
all the in the world.

836
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:57,399
You guys have been friends for
decades, but I wish that you

837
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,499
guys could have that in private
because so much is public.

838
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,032
This is where I
will take accountability.

839
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:08,065
I could've reacted better.
There's no good excuse.

840
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:09,999
And I wish that I wasn't
tweeting.

841
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,733
I think there's
hurt on both sides and strikes

842
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:16,265
on both sides, like, "How can I
get him to see me or hear me?"

843
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:19,532
Like, we... I thought we was
friends, but-but-but what you're

844
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:22,532
saying, and I get it, there's a
better way to handle these

845
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:24,065
- things.
- Totally.

846
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:25,532
I bought you a gift.

847
00:42:25,533 --> 00:42:27,432
- My God.
- So I'm into

848
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:29,466
- crystals.
- So am I.

849
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:31,332
It's a Herkimer diamond.

850
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,466
- My God.
- And it's for, it's

851
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:38,199
for good feeling, for
manifestations, whatever it is

852
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,265
you're trying to get, whatever
journey you're going on.

853
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:44,065
Thank you. I love that.
That's so nice of you.

854
00:42:44,066 --> 00:42:46,532
Thank you.
It's good that we all have,

855
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:49,766
like, calm, understanding
conversation.

856
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,065
- That's really nice of you.
- Because you love

857
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:55,466
him, I love you.
Like, you know, and families go

858
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:58,032
- through things.
- Totally.

859
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:01,432
I just think that everyone
should communicate to each other

860
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:06,366
and not on social media, and I
think you just get so much more

861
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:10,232
- done if you have a conversation.
- We are love.

862
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:12,232
- Love.
- That's really cool.

863
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:14,499
He is thinking of moving to
Chicago.

864
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,499
Your whole family's here.

865
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,599
Uprooting the kids...
I'm freaking out.

866
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,366
- You're not serious.
- No, I think he is

867
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:22,165
serious.
I'm literally trying the best

868
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,599
that I can to be there for
everyone...

869
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,466
Hey, hey, hey, don't press any
of that.

870
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:28,399
And sometimes I'm just, like,
my... like, I just need a

871
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,232
minute.
I don't have any much more to

872
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,399
- give.
- If it's a family trip,

873
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,366
of course I don't want to miss
out on those time.

874
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:36,432
I don't want to,
like, give mixed messages.

875
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:39,232
Mixed messages of what?

876
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:41,400
