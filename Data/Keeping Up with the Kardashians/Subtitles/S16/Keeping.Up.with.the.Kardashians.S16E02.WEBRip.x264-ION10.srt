KHLOE: Actually, my best
friend was a guy and happened to

318
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:01,999
be Malika's boyfriend.
And he actually loved to keep us

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,532
separated, because I'm sure he
knew that we would hit it off

320
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:06,599
and be best friends.
MALIKA: And that's why he's

321
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,399
no longer in the picture.
KHLOE: (laughs) I would say I

322

we've been inseparable ever

that you wanted from me, if

there was anything, was just to
see me consistent with you and

here.

789
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:20,199
KOURTNEY: Yeah.
KRIS: The results of MJ's

790
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,432
biopsy are saying it's a
terrible, intense infection,

791
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:29,165
which is still very serious.
I could never leave her now.

792
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,466
And because of that, I've
decided not to go to Bali with

793
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:35,532
my family, and stay home and
spend time with MJ, and be here

794
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:38,132
in case she needs me.
And I just want to make sure

795
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:39,733
she's okay. >> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

796
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:42,132
KRIS: But I'm glad Scott's
going.

797
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:44,132
KOURTNEY: Me, too.
KRIS: I'm really glad he's

798
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,499
going.
And it makes me feel less guilty

799
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,299
about not going, to be honest.
KOURTNEY: Yeah.

800
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:55,332
I'm going to pack one bathing
suit, though, for each day.

801
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,699
KRIS: Yeah, I would just take
things like that, and then

802
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,432
maybe, like, an option of, like,
a little bike short or

803
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:03,165
something under it.
'Cause I feel like the trip is

804
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,399
gonna be...
KOURTNEY: No, we're doing

805
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,499
more, like, soul searching...
KRIS: Yeah.

806
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,666
KOURTNEY: Than, like, tanning.

807
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:12,299
KRIS: Well, if you find your
soul, text me.

808
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:20,299
KOURTNEY: Yeah. ♪ ♪

809
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,766
KIM: Wakey, wakey.
Eggs and bakey.

810
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:27,566
(Kanye grunts)
How annoying would that be if I

811
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,766
woke you up like that? (Laughs)
KANYE: Mm-hmm.

812
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:32,399
KIM: I'm sorry to wake you
up; I just have to leave, so I

813
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,399
wanted to catch you before, so
we could talk face-to-face.

814
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,666
But... I was thinking about you
being in Chicago and the kids'

815
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:47,666
schedules and everything, and I
feel like they're in school now.

816
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:50,666
I don't want to, like, uproot
them from all of their friends

817
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:54,733
and their routine and their
cousins and everything.

818
00:40:54,734 --> 00:40:59,399
And I just think that it would
be amazing to have a second

819
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,699
place in Chicago.
And if you need to spend more

820
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,265
time out there, that's
totally fine.

821
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,766
But I think it would be really
hard just to take the kids and

822
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:12,299
leave and permanently move to
Chicago.

823
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,766
KANYE: You know, when I went
to Chicago, I felt like I was

824
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,466
home.
There was a lot of things that

825
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:23,199
I missed...
um, just not being there for a

826
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,432
long, long, long time.
KIM: Yeah. I get that.

827
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:30,332
KANYE: Yeah. Like, you know,
it's funny, 'cause you said...

828
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:33,632
I said, "I'm never going home,"
but what is home though exactly?

829
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:36,332
You know?
I have literally a song called.

830
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:40,432
"Coming Home."
It is not about, uh, a house in.

831
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:42,766
Hidden Hills.
KIM: Calabasas. Yeah.

832
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:46,232
(Kanye laughs)
Well, so what do you want to do?

833
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:48,599
Do you want to live in Chicago
and I'll live here?

834
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,399
And we'll FaceTime?
I mean, I'm willing to split it.

835
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,599
I'm just saying, during the
school year, it's gonna be

836
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,433
really hard.

837
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,999
I do think it's really important
to definitely support my

838
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,032
husband, but our whole life is
in California.

839
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:08,466
I met him when he lived in
California.

840
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:10,733
It's not like I met him and he
lived in Chicago and moved to.

841
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:14,499
California for us.
KANYE: I feel connected.

842
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,366
I feel inspired. Um...
KIM: When you go there.

843
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:21,599
KANYE: Yeah. When we're there.

844
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,766
KIM: Maybe we should get a
place in Chicago that we can go

845
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:29,499
back and forth to, but it's not
gonna benefit us if we're, you

846
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,265
know, that separated all the
time.

847
00:42:32,266 --> 00:42:34,499
Okay, so we're in agreement.
We're not moving our family to.

848
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,699
Chicago full-time?
KANYE: Yeah, we're not gonna

849
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,766
move full-time, but we will...
KIM: Spend more time there.

850
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,065
KANYE: Spend time because
that's my home, too.

851
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:47,666
Like, when I'm in Chicago,
they're like, "Ye!"

852
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:50,399
It's Kanye! Ye! Look."
They're like, literally, like,

853
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,265
"Yay." Like, my name is, like,

854
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:58,032
K-A-N-Y-A-Y.
Like, "Yay! Kan-yay!"

855
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:01,999
And, you know, when I'm in L.A.,
they're like, "Oh, it's Ye."

856
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,332
KIM: No, they're like, "Kim!
(whoops) Kim! Oh, my God!"

857
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:12,032
It's Kim Kardashian!"
KANYE: Yeah.

858
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:15,766
KIM: On the next episode...
It's so high!

859
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:18,265
(women screaming)
(elephant trumpets)

860
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:22,332
Bali is so green and beautiful.
KHLOE: Oh!

861
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,466
Yeah, it's pretty epic.
You are so (bleep) up your own

862
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:27,466
ass(bleep).
I don't even have to (bleep) be

863
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:29,466
here. >> KOURTNEY: I just really

864
00:43:29,467 --> 00:43:31,466
wanted this to be, like, a
positive trip between us.

865
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:33,466
I just think that kind of an
outburst isn't normal.

866
00:43:33,467 --> 00:43:35,466
KHLOE: My feelings were hurt.
SCOTT: Both of you hurt each

867
00:43:35,467 --> 00:43:37,399
other's feelings.
KHLOE: I'm gonna slap her in

868
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,666
her (bleep) mouth.
