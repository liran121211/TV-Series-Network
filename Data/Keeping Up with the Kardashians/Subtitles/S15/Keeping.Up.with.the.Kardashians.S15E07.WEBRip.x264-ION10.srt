00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,733
it would've been over for her.
KIM: If would've been over.

159
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:39,165
Over.
I literally woke up at 6:00 in

160
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,666
the morning, and I saw it, and
I was like... (gasps)

161
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,666
And I called her and Travis.
They were like, "What's wrong?"

162
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,165
What's wrong?"
They thought something was

163
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,666
wrong, and I'm like, "There's
pictures of you on TMZ."

couldn't be further from the...

Cinderella fairy dust and

KRIS: Exactly what it was.

275
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,132
KHLOE: I think she thinks
she's, like, speaking her truth

276
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,099
more and she's... 'cause she
says, "I've been"

277
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,299
nonconfrontational for the past
"ten years and now I'm finding

278
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,366
my voice again."
I don't really know what that

279
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,766
means, but if she feels that
way, that's good.

280
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,366
I don't want to push that away
from her, but I think there's

281
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:09,265
also a way that we could all get
along here.

around to say, "You had the"

best, most magical childhood of
any child ever."

That's what we prided ourselves
on.

285
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,065
KHLOE: No, but I don't think
it's the childhood, I think

286
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:20,999
she's blaming you specifically.
KRIS: For what?

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,132
KHLOE: She probably felt like
she was always picking a side

288
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:26,399
and it was always my dad's.
In the divorce, she always

289
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,299
picked his. KRIS: Yeah. She did.

290
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,132
KHLOE: In the trial, she
picked his.

291
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,399
KRIS: She did. She was
convinced.

292
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,132
KHLOE: She wanted to live
there over your house.

293
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:37,032
Like, she's always picked his.
So there's something.

294
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,399
KRIS: That's interesting.
KHLOE: When my parents got

295
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,399
divorced, Kourtney took my dad's
side.

divorce because my mom had an

KIM: I don't know, but

299
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,232
he e-mailed her again and said
he wanted to meet up with her.

300
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:54,032
KOURTNEY: That's the worst
idea I've ever even heard.

301
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,032
KRIS: I've paid a price for
what happened to me in my life

302
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,165
and I would hope that none of
you would have to go through the

303
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,165
same things I went through.
KOURTNEY: Okay. I don't want

304
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,332
to keep talking about this.
I don't relate to it.

305
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:07,165
I don't understand it.
KHLOE: She holds and harbors

306
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,165
all this resentment towards my
mom.

307
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,432
Okay, that's fine, but let's
work things through.

308
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:16,299
I don't understand, like, why
Kourtney would want to just hold

309
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,165
on to that negative space that
they're in.

310
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,065
For her, I think it's a way to
heal.

311
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,165
Like, if she discusses... I don't
know.

312
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,432

accept that circumstance in her

else to be responsible for her

KHLOE: Why are you bringing

317
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:43,466

KRIS: This. Because that's

318
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,332
where she pinched me when she
was a teenager.

319
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,366
KHLOE: She didn't pinch you,
she scratched you.

320
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,466
KRIS: This was more than a
scratch if I'm still carrying it

321

KHLOE: A pinch is nothing.

783
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:53,632
KHLOE: The bond we all had
was so strong and beautiful and

784
00:40:53,633 --> 00:40:58,065
it's crazy she's just gone.
KIM: Yummy.

785
00:40:58,066 --> 00:41:00,733
KRIS: This looks so good.
KHLOE: Does everyone know the

786
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:02,566
necklace I got Kendall?
KRIS: What?

787
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:04,432
KENDALL: It's Gabbana's paw
print.

788
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:06,999
KRIS: Kendall. Aw.
COREY: Aw, that's tight.

789
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,999
KENDALL: Isn't it cute?
KHLOE: And I got her ashes

790
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,566
today, but I have Gabbana's bed,
and I haven't felt the need to

791
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:17,532
get rid of it yet, but I feel
like now I want to sub Gabbana's

792
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:19,666
bed for a baby bed.
I think it's time.

793
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:22,699
KIM: That's really sweet.
KHLOE: Today was actually the

794
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,999
first day that I felt like I
could take her bed out of my

795
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,032
room.
Whenever I would come back from.

796
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:33,532
Cleveland, Gabbana would be
there and she was just my buddy.

797
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,999
But now whenever I come back
from Cleveland I'll have a baby.

798
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,733
I'm grateful that Gabbana left
me at a time where she knew I

799
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:42,766
wouldn't be alone.
COREY: Well, have you seen

800
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,699
the facilities yet, where you're
giving birth?

801
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,632
KHLOE: No.
KOURTNEY: Don't go see them

802
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:47,766
in advance. >> KHLOE: Why?

803
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,699
KOURTNEY: 'Cause it's not a
good idea.

804
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,132
SCOTT: You know what the
rooms look like.

805
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,733
KOURTNEY: She's not giving
birth there.

806
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:54,499
KHLOE: I'm not giving birth
at Cedars.

807
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,099
SCOTT: So you should go look.
KOURTNEY: No.

808
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,499
The first time, we didn't look.
I had no clue what was

809
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,165
happening and it's so much
better that way.

810
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,699
SCOTT: Is it?
KHLOE: Tim went this weekend

811
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,566
and assessed it all.
SCOTT: Okay.

812
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:07,699
KRIS: Kylie!
KOURTNEY: Hi, Ky. Hi, Stormi.

813
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,699
KHLOE: Oh, my God!
Hey, bo-bo. Mwah.

814
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,566
KIM: Oh, my goodness.
KHLOE: Ours are gonna be

815
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,165
twins, I think.
KIM: Oh, she just gave me the

816
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:15,566
craziest side-eye.
Did you see that?

817
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:16,699
KYLIE: Yeah, she's...
KIM: She literally went like

818
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,699
this.
KYLIE: 'Cause she knows you

819
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,232
kissed me first before my mom.
KHLOE: And she'll never let

820
00:42:21,233 --> 00:42:23,199
that down.
KENDALL: What happened?

821
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,199
KHLOE: Kim got to kiss her
before Kylie did.

822
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,733
KIM: It was, like, days later.

823
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:28,599
Who knew that she didn't kiss
her on the mouth?

824
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,666
KYLIE: She was like, "Ooh!"
And jokingly was like, "Ooh,

825
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,766
"look, I'm your first kiss," and
kissed her, and I was like...

826
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:34,766
(gasps)
KHLOE: Kylie's like, "That is"

827
00:42:34,767 --> 00:42:38,766
not funny."
KIM: Stop. Will you text that

828
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,599
to me? >> KHLOE: Oh, my God.

829
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,999
KENDALL: Let me see.
KIM: We're gonna have, like,

830
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,666
a book of, like, the triplets.
KYLIE: I know.

831
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:49,065
KIM: Okay, so now that it's,
like, all said and done...

832
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,733
KYLIE: Mm-hmm.
KIM: What is your real

833
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,733
take on pregnancy?
KYLIE: I like it. I miss it.

834
00:42:53,734 --> 00:42:55,733
KIM: You miss it?
KYLIE: Yeah, I had, like, the

835
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:57,733
easiest pregnancy ever.
Like, you just feel... you never

836
00:42:57,734 --> 00:43:01,065
feel alone and, like, I was
really sad to not be pregnant

837
00:43:01,066 --> 00:43:03,099
anymore. >> KIM: That's so cute.

838
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,532
KYLIE: Khloe, I'm just so
excited for you.

839
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:07,232
I can't wait.
KRIS: I'd like to raise a

840
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:12,632
glass and make a toast to Khloe,
another little Kardashian that

841
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:15,232
you're bringing into the world.
Next there'll be nine.

842
00:43:15,233 --> 00:43:18,165
KOURTNEY: Cheers, everyone.
ALL: Cheers.

843
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:20,666
KOURTNEY: Yay to Khloe.
KYLIE: Cheers to Khloe.

844
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:23,032
Stormi's not gonna be the new
girl in town anymore.

845
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,132
KIM: Chicago was, like, the
new girl in town for, like, a

846
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:26,699
day. >> KYLIE: Two weeks.

847
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,666
KOURTNEY: And now Stormi's
got three months, maybe, as the

848
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:31,132
new girl.
KYLIE: Anyone else pregnant?

849
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:35,099
KRIS: Nope. Not me. I'm good.
KIM: Nope, but...

850
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,566
COREY: Wait a minute. Wait,
wait, if you get...

851
00:43:37,567 --> 00:43:42,132
KIM: Just kidding. (Laughter)

852
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:44,165
Keeping Up
With the Kardashians...

853
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,699
WOMAN: You're always working
and you need to have a better

854
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,065
work-life balance.
WOMAN: To our world tour.

855
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:53,599
WOMAN 2: Our world tour.
KENDALL: Tour.

856
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,299
KHLOE: Are you and Kanye good?

857
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,599
KIM: We had a fight 'cause I
wouldn't get him a Band-Aid.

858
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,265
KHLOE: Kim, like, you
completely left Kourtney on that

859
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:04,265
(bleep) e-mail.
KIM: I was talking about.

860
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,299
Kourtney in the e-mail as if she
wasn't on the e-mail.
