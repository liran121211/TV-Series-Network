I got to jump ship, though, and

JONATHAN: Uh, midnight.

518

me and get there.

Kourtney, why are you leaning

645
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:37,232
KOURTNEY: Where?
KENDALL: Right here.

646
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,132

It's so gray.

Oh, it's this long?

KENDALL (laughing): Yeah.
KOURTNEY: Do you think it

649
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,499
just grew really fast or do you
think it's been there?

650
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,299
KENDALL (laughing): I think
it's been there.

651
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,999
Right? I don't think they grow
that fast.

652
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,065
KOURTNEY: I think it, maybe
it just grew overnight.

653
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:57,532
So, I just had therapy with
Scott.

654
00:29:57,533 --> 00:30:00,132
KENDALL: Ooh, how was it?
KOURTNEY: It was good.

KENDALL: I like that you guys
still go.

656
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,299
KOURTNEY: It's, like, we have
to talk, like, really proper,

657
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,566
like, with this girl and be
like, "I feel..."

658
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:12,132
Or, like, instead of saying,
"Well, you did it because

659
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:14,399
"da-da-da," like, you can't do,
like, mind reading.

660
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,532
So I have to say, "I'm guessing
that you did this because blah",

661
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:20,532
blah, blah, blah."
Like, instead of just saying you

662
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:23,999
did it because whatever.
KENDALL: Has he brought her

663
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,532
around more?
KOURTNEY: I don't know.

664
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:30,332
I mean, he just apologized.
KENDALL: That's good.

665
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,499
KOURTNEY: I did see his side
a little bit 'cause I was like,

666
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,165
"I feel like you're doing things
selfishly."

667
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,165
And he's like, "I'm doing things
for myself, but also because it"

668
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:42,165
makes me happy and I'm putting
that onto the kids.

669
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,599
Like, they can know, and I don't
want to lie to them and I don't

670
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,165
want them to think that I'm
not being truthful about certain

671
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,632
"things." So...
KENDALL: Yeah. That makes

672
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:53,499
sense. >> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

673
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,566
After our last fight, Scott and
I had another therapy session

674
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:01,432
and he apologized.
I'm not trying to control the

675
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:04,432
situation, you know.
That's just me being an involved

CICI: Well, 'cause they asked

788
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,532
me. >> KRIS: Who asked you?

789
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:43,466
CICI: Kim.
She said, "I didn't know my"

790
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,466
grandma was here.
Why isn't she on the show?"

791
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,599
KRIS: Yeah, because nobody
knew she was coming, and then

792
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,666
she said she wanted to come
watch.

793
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,699
CICI: Listen, I just told the
truth.

794
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,032
KRIS: I know, but...
be a politician.

795
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:58,299
So are her feelings hurt?
CICI: Ask her.

796
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,532
KRIS: Mom!
CICI: She says no.

797
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,532
KRIS: Well, then why would
you say they are?

798
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:04,733
CICI: 'Cause she's also said
they were.

799
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:07,432
KRIS: Okay, you said that you
didn't know if you were gonna

800
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:11,299
feel well or not today, so we
had to fly Jonathan in from.

801
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,032
Miami. No, I'm just saying.

802
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:15,699
I know, but I'm...
Now, Cici was saying that your

803
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,499
feelings were hurt.
MJ: No, I didn't.

804
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,232
KRIS: Because you weren't on
the show, and I just want to

805
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:22,032
make sure that we have this
right.

806
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:23,599
MJ: No, no.
That wasn't about Jonathan.

807
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,032
KRIS: We can't just tell...
a TV show with hundreds of

808
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:30,432
people.
MJ: I already have a lady

809
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:33,566
taking me to the audience.
KRIS: Kim created this mess,

810
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:37,499
and I have to clean it up.
Just another fire to put out.

811
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,566
(laughs) Oh, my God.
They're trying to figure it out.

812
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:43,632
They can tell Jonathan he can't
be on the show if you want to be

813
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,366
on it.
MJ: No, Jonathan's fine.

814
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:51,599
Like I said, he's young and
he'll know all the answers.

815
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,399
KRIS: Can somebody go talk
to her?

816
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,399
WOMAN: Tracy?
KRIS: It has to be somebody

817
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,399
with a softer approach.
I'm being too direct.

818
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,532
TRACY: Do you want me to go
talk to her?

819
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:03,099
KRIS: Yeah.
TRACY: I'll get the final

820
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,999
answer. Hi, MJ.

821
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,065
Did you want to do it?
Are you doing it?

822
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:12,499
MJ: No, Jonathan's doing it.
TRACY: But the thing is, if

823
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,065
you want to do it...
MJ: No, no, I don't want to

824
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,532
take his place 'cause he had to
come a long ways.

825
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:19,532
TRACY: I think he'll be
totally fine and understand.

826
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:21,265
MJ: No, I would've loved to
have done it, but if Jonathan

827
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:26,065
came all that way, that's fine.
STEVE: Ideally, what do you

828
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:28,332
want to work out?
COREY: MJ just stand next to

829
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,632
you and... >> STEVE: Who's MJ?

830
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:31,566
COREY: That's her mother.
STEVE: That's the grandma?

831
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:33,632
COREY: That's the boss.
KRIS: We flew somebody in

832
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:36,566
last night because we didn't
have a player, and now my mom is

833
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:39,299
like, "Well, what about me?"
And I'm like, "Oh, my God."

834
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,566
COREY: She really wants to
play, like, she thinks she was

835
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,632
playing.
TRACY: She doesn't want to be

836
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:46,432
in the way, but she does want...
I know she wants to play.

837
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,499
STEVE: Let me solve this
problem.

838
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,099
Let me get Gaby.
She's executive producer.

839
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,566
She's the only one who can solve
this problem.

840
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:55,766
KRIS: I mean, there's just
not even any words for how

841
00:37:55,767 --> 00:38:00,566
ridiculous it is that Steve
Harvey then has to step in and

842
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:04,632
try to figure this mess out for
us, so that everybody's happy.

843
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:07,366
KIM: Jonathan, have you heard
the drama?

844
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:09,099
JONATHAN: Nothing.
What happened?

845
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,032
I was in hair and makeup.
I haven't even changed yet.

846
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:14,666
COREY: So we got this fixed.
So it's all done.

847
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:19,032
STEVE: We gonna put the
grandmother next to Kris.

848
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:21,699
They're gonna share a mic.
They can argue and discuss they

849
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,399
answers.
First time they've ever done

850
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,599
six, but y'all special, they
gonna make it happen for you.

851

KIM: They were about to kick
you off.

852
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,065
I really fought hard for you.
JONATHAN: I would've

853
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:33,666
literally, it would've been a
brawl in here after this hell.

854

KIM: Honestly, Steve Harvey
really came through and figured

855
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:39,666
this out for us.
The Kardashian side could have

856
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:42,466
six players.
Everyone can play, and I think

857
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,466
it still evens out.
Still a fair trade.
