When I came on board trying to

worked hard on getting letters

We got the help of the

122

prosecutor, and there was
misinformation in her file that

123
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,766

And we already submitted a bunch

qualified to talk about Kanye."

165

00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:13,632
I have these people on the

485
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:16,566
I'll call you right back.

486

KIM: Hi. >> BRITTANY: Hi. Hi.

487
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:21,232

went really, really well.

with Jeff Sessions, John.

491
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:35,332
I mean, it was just all of those
men were in there.

492
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,065
All of those guys left, except
for John Kelly kind of hovered.

493
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:40,366
And it was a lot of
chitchatting, you know.

494
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:43,065
They talked a little bit about
The Celebrity

495
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:45,065
and things like that.

496
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:48,132
KIM: A lot of Kanye talk.
"I love Kanye, I love him."

497
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:50,332
Um, "He's so great."
I mean, just, like, overly...

498

KIM: You know, 'cause Kanye

499
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,099
has been positive about him.
Um, but I did want to keep this

500
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,399
very separate from Kanye,
because I think, you know, we

501
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,766
just...
And he said the same thing...

502
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:04,632
That he wanted to keep this as a
completely separate

503
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:07,132
conversation.
But Jared has said that, you

504
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:10,366
know, Kanye reaching out and
speaking out has been very

505
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,532
positive for this.
SHAWN: We talked about the

506
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:16,265
fact that her codefendants...
Most of them are out.

507
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:18,432
They didn't like...
You know, they didn't like the

508
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:20,999
fact that she was in, and they
were out.

509

the right thing to do.

I just... I just hope...

go."

as close as 99%" is what Jared

But he's like, "I can never give"

It's like, this is something

672
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,566
to give not only prisoners
hope, but America hope again,

673
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,566

Okay, get back to your meeting.

Okay, bye.
ALICE: I'm telling you, this

678
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:16,065
is something that everywhere I
go... if you could only just walk

679
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:19,199
down the streets of Memphis... I
know you can't, but I do.

680
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,299
People recognize me now, and
they're in tears, hugging me and

681
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,699
telling me how happy they are
that I've come back home.

682
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,332
I don't know these people, but
they're so happy for me.

683
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,466
It's just love.
It's... I'm telling you, it's

684
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:34,065
like a lovefest, if you want to
call it that.

685
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:37,099
I've seen that word before, a
"lovefest," but this is what's

686

KIM: On this journey of

687
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,332
getting Alice out, I have
learned so much about criminal

688
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:50,099
justice and really how messed up
our system is.

689
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,199
Jared was texting me and said,
"Honestly, we couldn't have"

690
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,065
picked a better person to open
up his heart, and for this to

691
00:39:56,066 --> 00:39:59,065
"get started, because now he
doesn't want to stop."

692
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:05,099

That's all you, so thank you.

case is the one that spoke to
