00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,766
KIM: Oh. MJ: I have the app.

638
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:01,065
KIM: Yeah. >> MJ: (chuckles)

639
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:02,766
Isn't that what you do?
KRIS: Hey, Mom.

640
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:04,399
MJ: Hi. KRIS: You look cute.

641
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,566
MJ: Well, thank you.
KRIS: Hi, Kimbo.

642
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,499
KIM: Hi, Mom.
MJ: Love your shoes, Krissy.

643
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,632
KRIS: Thank you.
MJ: They're so cute.

644
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,766
KRIS: Thanks.
KIM: Oh, so, I called Khloe

645
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,566
today, and I was like,
"Honestly, so many more stories"

646
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,432
have come out, so many friends
are calling me with, like, so

647
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:22,032
many more things."
MJ: I just found out, so I've

648
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:25,099
just, you know, I'm still
crying, so I can't...

649
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,632
KIM: Oh, you just found out.
MJ: Yeah.

650
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:29,132
KIM: Oh. MJ: I'm really sad.

651
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:31,632
Ruined my makeup. >> KIM: Yeah.

652
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:35,099
MJ: All the way over here.
KIM: You know, I told her,

653
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,566
"What is, what are you gonna get
out of him?"

654
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:40,165
I go, "Think about it.
You're gonna be worried and"

655
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,532
nervous and have an insecure
life, 'cause if he's not

656
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:44,399
faithful now..."
MJ: He'll never change.

657
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,733
KIM: Yeah, he'll never change.

658
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:50,199
When one thing comes out, you
kind of hope, like, "Okay, well",

659
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,999
maybe the video's old or maybe
it's a misunderstanding, maybe

660
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,532
"something," 'cause a picture
doesn't always tell the full

661
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:01,466
story.
But then, you know, two more

662
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:06,265
stories come out.
This is just, like, crazy.

663
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:09,165
And now, you know, you know it's
true.

664
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:12,265
MJ: Find-find a different type.

665
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:14,666
You know? >> KIM: Yeah.

666
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,999
MJ: An accountant or something.

667
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,699
KIM: Yeah. Preach, Grandma.
MJ: A preacher.

668
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,032
KIM: An accountant. (Both laugh)

669
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,466
KRIS: Okay, so I need your
attention.

670
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:27,099
KIM: Yeah?
KRIS: This university... Brown.

671
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,499
University... they have a class
called "Keeping Up with Keeping."

672
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,766
"Up." >> KIM: Yeah.

673
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:34,099
MJ: How cute.
KRIS: And I'm gonna surprise

674
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,566
the class by Skyping in.
Then I thought what I could do

675
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:39,232
is say that you're here, too...
KIM: Okay.

676
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:41,599
KRIS: And surprise you,
and MJ can pop in.

677
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,733
MJ: They'll be so excited.
KRIS: Where is Kourtney?

678
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:46,733
MJ: Upstairs getting her makeup.

679
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:50,032
KRIS: So I'll get on with
them now.

680
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:52,032
KIM: I can't believe they
have a class like that.

681
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:54,032
KRIS: Isn't that wild?
KIM: Yeah, to get credit for

682
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:58,199
school on our show... like,
that's crazy.

683
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,599
KRIS: The timing isn't great
with what's going on with Khloe.

684
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,733
KIM: But we can't really
reschedule the call, so, if

685
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:05,733
anything, it's like a good
distraction to get...

686
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:07,999
KRIS: For sure.
KIM: You know, our minds

687
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,065
off of everything. (Laughter)

688
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:13,499
KRIS: Hi, guys.
(indistinct chatter)

689
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,733
What are you...?
Oh, my God, it's all women?

690
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:20,132
ALL: Yes!
KRIS: Oh, that's so cool.

691
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:22,532
Well, hi. Happy Wednesday.

692
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,733
KIM: I could probably help
out with some reports.

693
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:28,766
(laughter)
That's crazy that you guys

694
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,499
actually get credit for this.
WOMAN: It's not that crazy,

695
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,733
because you guys are just so
relevant to American culture

696
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:36,532
that... and I think really, it
makes a lot of sense for us to

697
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,199
be studying you guys.
So, in general, why do you feel

698
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,232
like your family's become such
polarizing figures?

699
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:44,632
Where do you think that some of
that both positivity and

700
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:47,099
negativity comes from?
And then, how do you, I guess,

701
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,532
deal with that?
KIM: Sometimes I feel torn

702
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:51,566
about it, 'cause sometimes,
like, if I post a photo...

703
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,299
KOURTNEY: Hi, guys.
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

704
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,632
KIM: Welcome to the party.
KRIS: There she is.

705
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:59,165
KOURTNEY: Sorry. I was glamming.

706
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:02,232
KRIS: You're late, but go on.
KIM: Well, I think we've gone

707
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,766
through every crazy thing that
you could possibly imagine, and

708
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,766
we've shared that.
I think just people can relate

709
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:10,766
to that, whether they want us to
win or not.

710
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:14,299
I mean, it's so funny to me, the
people that are so bothered.

711
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,766
Like, I get it.
If it's not your thing, like,

712
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:19,232
it's not your thing, so don't...
You know, change the channel or

713
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:21,232
whatever, but at the end of the
day, people can criticize all

714
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,666
day long. We have each other.

715
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,666
(phone ringing)
KOURTNEY: Is that your phone?

716
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,666
KRIS: I don't know.
KIM: No. Um...

717
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,666
You don't know your ringtone?
KRIS: It's like everybody

718
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:31,666
else's. >> KOURTNEY: That's not

719
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:33,666
everybody else's.
KIM: It's not everyone else's

720
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,666
ringtone.
That's a really annoying, loud

721
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,666
ringtone.
KRIS: So, it's annoying,

722
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,666
okay. >> MJ: So they are normal.

723
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,666
KRIS: Just push the button.
WOMAN: We're wondering how

724
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:43,666
you balance your
responsibilities as both a

725
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,999
character on your show and also
a producer?

726
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,265
KIM: Kourtney?
KRIS: I think as far as...

727
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:50,265
What? You want to answer that?
KOURTNEY: They said you have

728
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:52,566
to check your phone right this
second.

729
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,265
KRIS: Oh. Okay, I got to go.

730
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:57,332
She's gonna answer that
question.

731
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:00,132
I'll be right back. KIM: Okay.

732
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:04,165
KOURTNEY: Um, I think...
I mean, we're always thinking

733
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:07,032
of, like... What?
KIM: Kourtney's not that good

734
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:09,165
at this role.
KOURTNEY: At producing?

735
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,199
(laughter)
No. I mean, people are always

736
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,199
coming up with fun things...
KRIS: Hey. No, but I can try

737
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,065
and get another plane.
Why? Are you contracting?

738
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:19,332
Ah, (bleep).
Okay, we should have come last

739
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:23,199
night. I knew it!

740
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,566
All right. No, I'm-I'm good.
I'm just, I'm gonna be calm.

741
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,566
I just, let me figure it out
and see how fast we can get out

742
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:34,699
of here.
She's in labor, like, full-blown

743
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,366
labor, and I'm in charge of
bringing the doctor.

744
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:40,299
Ah, (bleep).
I mean, what's gonna happen if.

745
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,332
Dr. A isn't there to deliver the
baby?

746
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,599
We've got to get there right
now.

747
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,467
It just doesn't get any worse.

748
00:36:56,367 --> 00:37:00,599
KRIS: Hi. So, listen, Khloe's
in labor, so here's the thing.

749
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,733
Can you get to the airport by
5:00?

750
00:37:02,734 --> 00:37:05,332
ALIABADI: Let me... Yeah.
Let me go see my last patient,

751
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:08,632
and I'll run out.
KRIS: Okay. Bye.

752
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:10,766
(whispering): I got to go.
Wrap it up.

753
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:13,065
I got to go. >> KIM: Okay.

754
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,232
KRIS: Do you want to just
pause them, or...?

755
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,232
KIM: Okay. One sec.
KRIS: I can't wait one

756
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:19,733
second.
KIM: Um, we have to go, but,

757
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:23,065
um, we are so excited that you
guys... this is actually a real

758
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,366
course. >> KRIS: She's in labor.

759
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:27,499
MJ: She's what?
KRIS: I think she's in labor.

760
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,532
MJ: I thought so, with this.
KRIS: Yeah, yeah, so I got to

761
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:31,766
go get on a plane.
WOMAN: Oh, thank you so much.

762
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:34,999
KOURTNEY: Okay, bye, guys.
KIM: Thanks, you guys. Bye.

763
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,999
KRIS: Okay, I got to go.
I just moved the plane up, and I

764
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,999
think she's in labor.
KIM: Okay, well, to when?

765
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,766
KRIS: I knew we should have
gone last night, I knew it.

766
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:42,999
KIM: Do you want me to go
with you?

767
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,999
KRIS: No, you come in a
couple of days.

768
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,999
I'm going, I'm bringing the
doctor.

769
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,099
KIM: I'll go.
Like, I don't care.

770
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,366
KRIS: Uh, the only thing that
frightens me is that she's gonna

771
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:53,366
have this baby before I can get
there, and then she's giving

772
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:58,265
birth alone.
KIM: Hey, are you okay?

773
00:37:58,266 --> 00:38:00,399
KHLOE: Yeah.
KIM: Um, how are you feeling?

774
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,532
Do you want me to come with Mom,
'cause I could go?

775
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,432
KRIS: I got to go.
Bye, everybody.

776
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:06,432
I love you. >> KHLOE: Should the

777
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:08,499
contractions feel like period
cramps?

778
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,432
KOURTNEY: Yeah.
KIM: I'm here with Kourt and.

779
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:12,399
Grandma.
KHLOE: But they keep going

780
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,332
from different times, so I don't
understand if I'm feeling them.

781
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,432
KOURTNEY: Write it down.
KHLOE: Oh, no, one was at

782
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,566
9:43, one was at 8:21, one was
at 10:00 something.

783
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,699
KIM: I feel like I should go.
KHLOE: 9:28.

784
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,065
KOURTNEY: Yeah. >> KIM: Okay.

785
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:25,999
KHLOE: And now, another one
was at 3:50.

786
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,399
KIM: Okay, I'm gonna run and,
um, get my bag, and I'm gonna

787
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,532
come with Mom.
I'll call you right back.

788
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:34,132
KOURTNEY: Call Corey.
KIM: I'm on my way. Bye.

789
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:36,999
You know, when there's something
crazy that goes on in our

790
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,065
family, we just always drop
everything that we're doing and

791
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:47,032
go be supportive to them.
I obviously wanted to go to my

792
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,532
reunion, and I wanted to make
both work, but since my reunion

793
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:53,632
is in two days, it's like, game
over, it's doesn't matter.

794
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:56,733
I'm gonna go to Cleveland and be
there for her.

795
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,733
KHLOE: Mom's already
stressing me out.

796
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:01,032
KOURTNEY: Yeah.
KHLOE: When I said, "Hey, I"

797
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:04,165
think I'm having contractions,"
she said, "(bleep)."

798
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,599
And I go, "What?"
KOURTNEY: No, she comes in

799
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,599
the room.
She comes in the room and goes,

800
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,699
"I got to go.
I got to go, guys."

801
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,165
(Khloe laughs) Um...

802
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:16,599
KHLOE: She's just too much,
and then, I love Kim, and I love

803
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,099
all you guys, but, like, Kim...
You know, it's like everyone

804
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,332
wants me to make a decision
right this second, and I just

805
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:24,099
want to go and give birth, and
focus on that, and, like, try to

806
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,466
enjoy this, and try to enjoy it
with him.

807
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:28,599
PENELOPE: Mom, can we go
through my backpack?

808
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,432
KHLOE: As bad as... like, as
crazy as that sounds, I want to

809
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,699
enjoy this with him.
KOURTNEY: Yeah.

810
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,099
KHLOE: I don't want any
negativity in the delivery room.

811
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,366
I don't want anyone to talk
about it, make me feel

812
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,532
uncomfortable or him
uncomfortable.

813
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,532
Like, let's just act normal
for...

814
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,532
Give me a minute.
KOURTNEY: Yeah. Okay, I'll

815
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:46,632
keep you posted on what's going
on.

816
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:48,632
KHLOE: Okay, thank you.
KOURTNEY: Okay, bye.

817
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:50,500
MJ: Love you, Khlo.

818
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:09,199
KHLOE: So, the date is April
11, and it is 7:03 p.m., and

819
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,466
I've been having contractions
for quite some time, so I'm

820
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:15,766
waiting.
My family is getting on an

821
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:19,666
airplane from L.A., and the
doctor, so I just hope everyone

822
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,566
gets here in time.
And we're just excited to meet

823
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:26,165
you. Try to hold on a little bit

824
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:30,132
longer in there.
You've been cooking very well.

825
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:38,133
I love you, baby. Big belly.

826
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,232
ALEXA: I hope someone can get
in the air soon.

827
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,499
PRODUCER: Yeah.
They said five minutes.

828
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,032
I just asked.
MALIKA: I'm gonna have no

829
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:51,132
cuticles by the time I get to
Cleveland, I swear.

830
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:54,165
KOURTNEY: We had to find two
planes at the last second.

831
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:57,466
My mom's plane lands first with
the doctor.

832
00:40:57,467 --> 00:41:01,666
They're leaving from LAX, and
then, Malika and Kim and I are

833
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,733
taking a jet from Van Nuys.
We just really want to make it

834
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:07,032
there in time.
KHLOE: When are you guys

835
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:10,566
taking off?
MALIKA: Um, we're waiting on

836
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,532
the plane right now.
WOMAN: The plane's getting

837
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:14,566
fuel right now.
They said we should be able to

838
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:16,666
get on it in five.
MALIKA: So, not too much

839
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,132
longer. >> KHLOE: Okay.

840
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:21,132
MALIKA: I will see you shortly.

841
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:23,165
Where's Sav? KHLOE: Downstairs.

842
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,566
MALIKA: Okay. I'll call him.
KHLOE: Okay.

843
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:30,466
MALIKA: All right. Bye, babe.
Hi.

844
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:32,599
SAVAS: What's up?
MALIKA: Let's have a little

845
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,132
chitchat.
It's very easy to think you need

846
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:38,699
to rush or panic... you know what
I mean... because she's gonna be

847
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,032
acting a fool in the passenger
seat...

848
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:43,599
SAVAS: Yeah, yeah.
MALIKA: Somewhat ignore that.

849
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,632
Also, you know, she's very
tough.

850
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:48,065
She's gonna try not to let you
help her do a lot of things.

851
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:51,699
Don't-don't-don't listen to her,
don't argue with her.

852
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,065
Just take it and move.
Let her focus on her

853
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:56,299
contractions. SAVAS: All right.

854
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,232
MALIKA: All right, thanks. Bye.

855
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:03,232
(indistinct chatter) Hi, Kimmy.

856
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:06,299
Can you believe it?
KIM: I know, I'm so excited.

857
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,065
MALIKA: I'm, like, look, we
all know the problem.

858
00:42:09,066 --> 00:42:11,599
Let's just get on the solution.
KOURTNEY: Let's just what?

859
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,599
MALIKA: I said, we all know
the problem.

860
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,199
Let's just get on the solution.
KOURTNEY: I don't think there

861
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,466
is one.
MALIKA: Have the damn baby

862
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:21,532
and let her figure her life out.
KOURTNEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

863
00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:23,499
MALIKA: You know what I mean?
That's all... to me, that's the

864
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,499
best thing to do at this point.
KOURTNEY: Yeah, totally.

865
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,232
MALIKA: 'Cause she's gonna
feel...

866
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:29,599
KIM: She just doesn't want us
to, like, start drama in the

867
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,632
hospital, so...
MALIKA: Yeah, she said,

868
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,599
specifically, you be nice.
KIM: Yeah, so...

869
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,632
MALIKA: I said, "Don't worry.
I got Kimmy for you."

870
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:38,199
KIM: Yeah.
I'm gonna look at him and just

871
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,199
be, like...
MALIKA: That's what a big

872
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,733
sister's supposed to do.
Okay, not the second one, babe.

873
00:42:44,734 --> 00:42:47,065
Do the look one, but not the...
KOURTNEY: I think the look

874
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:50,232
one's lame.
I think I would only do that.

875
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:53,466
MALIKA: You two are gonna be
a real problem for me.

876
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:56,733
He's definitely gonna have to
face you guys, but for her,

877
00:42:56,734 --> 00:43:00,766
we're not even...
Like, just... "Hi."

878
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:03,265
KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.
KIM: I don't even think "Hi."

879
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:05,232
MALIKA: Keep it cordial.
KIM: I think just like...

880
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:08,366
MALIKA: And you know what?
I actually like that.

881
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:12,099
'Cause that's decent.
KOURTNEY: I know how

882
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,699
important it is for Khloe to
have Tristan there, and I

883
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,766
actually really respect that,
but it's definitely going to be

884
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:22,265
awkward.
It's gonna be hard to even look

885
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,032
at him or be in the same room
with him.

886
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:29,265
It's like you are (bleep) with
all of us when you disrespect

887
00:43:29,266 --> 00:43:31,532
one of us. KIM: I think I'm just

888
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:35,165
gonna look at him and be like,
"To be continued, (bleep).

889
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:37,000
It's not over."

890
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:45,132
KIM: On the next episode...
KHLOE: I really pray that my

891
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:48,032
sisters get to the hospital in
time.

892
00:43:48,033 --> 00:43:51,399
KOURTNEY: How (bleep) insane
to be doing this by yourself?

893
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,699
KIM: How far out are we?
MAN: 25 minutes.

894
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,165
MALIKA: Oh, my God.
KOURTNEY: Hurry!

895
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:59,132
KIM: We can't miss this.
(Khloe groans, True cries)

896
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:01,132
KIM: I unfollowed Tristan on
Instagram.

897
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:03,132
KOURTNEY: Yeah.
KIM: He said I'm trying to

898
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:05,032
start stuff and I'm an
instigator.

899
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:09,032
I'm, like, done, done with him.
Over it.
