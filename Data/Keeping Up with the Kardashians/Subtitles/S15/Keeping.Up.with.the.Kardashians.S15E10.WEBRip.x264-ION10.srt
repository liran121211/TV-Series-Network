SCOTT: Being that Art.

11
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,599
Vandelay isn't really an artist,
we have to take that into our

If you weren't Middle Eastern

nonprofit organization called
Red Eye.

00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,232
He was given the keys to the
Watts Community Center, which

00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:52,299
is at risk of being shut down.
He wants to keep it open and

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,733
make a place for all the kids in
the community to go.

the kids every week for a little

over 12 years in the Watts

58

The average age of someone there
is 21, and the largest group

of people living there is the
age group of ten or younger.

60

raising kids out there.

it's looking like. KRIS: Okay.

69
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:36,065

basketball hoops inside the gym,

70

it was shot out three years...
It's never been replaced.

the walls, and, like, I see

kitchen.

74
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,632
The kitchen's falling apart.
And we've got to get them a

75
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,766
better, like, computer lab.
Because I've never one time

76

schoolwork.

just a community center, but
actually something that's gonna

79
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,099
empower them.
KRIS: So what would you do

80
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,599

had an outdoor play area?

I mean, these kids have changed

out loud.

152
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,766

Red Rover?

Call it a day?
KHLOE: Or... what's the

161
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,999
tug-of-war?
KOURTNEY: Tug-of-war.

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,132
KHLOE: Okay, yeah. (Laughs)

made them.

KHLOE: Scott, what is the

169
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:51,999
story behind these?
SCOTT: Behind the Art.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,699

KHLOE: Yeah. (Chuckles)

KHLOE: No, but, like, how

173
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,265
much, like, if she's like, "What
did you buy them for?"

174
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,432
SCOTT: Well...
We've got to think about the

175
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:04,666
time that we spent on them.
Obviously, the larger piece,

176
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,132
we spent eight minutes on...
(Khloe chuckles)

177
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:10,032
That, we spent six.
I would say you paid 50 for the

178

179
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:13,666

Art Vandelays for that?

182

183
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,766
Art Vandelay?
KHLOE: It will come up that

184
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,599
character.
SCOTT (laughs): Right!

185
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,199
KHLOE: So it will just be
confusing.

186
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,733
She'll be more like, "Huh,
okay."

187
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,566
JEANNE: He must be real
impressive.

188

KHLOE: He's really famous.
SCOTT: Yeah. You know, Kris's

189
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,566
assistant Matthew called me and
goes, "Can I have all the"

190
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,733
contact information and how much
they're worth, because Kris

191
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,165
wants to insure them."
But I told Matthew, I go,

192
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,032
"Please hold off, this is not
what you think it is."

193
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,332
KHLOE: But is he going to
tell on us?

194
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,566
SCOTT: No, he's, he's in on it.

195
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,199
I did tell Matthew to lie, but
then Matthew was also like,

196
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,065
"Uh, have you seen who I
work for?"

197
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,299
KHLOE: Right. And he's so...

198
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,065

up in a casket."

199

SCOTT: What's happening?
KRIS: I didn't know you

201
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,099
were here.
SCOTT: Oh, my goodness

202
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,632

KRIS: It's going.

206
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,499
SCOTT: Good.
KRIS: Yeah, I just spent a

207
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,466
couple hours...
Ooh, what is this?

208
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:10,199
Those paintings.
KHLOE: I know, I need to fi...

209
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,065
We were just talking about where
to put them. I don't know.

210
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,532
KRIS: Wait, did your friend
make those?

211
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,065
SCOTT: Yeah, that guy, Art
Vandelay.

212
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,733
KHLOE: I don't know if that's
your "friend."

213
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:18,632
SCOTT: Not really my friend.
It's an artist that I know.

214
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,099
KHLOE: I bought these, though.

215
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,566
KRIS: Do you want to walk
around the house and see where

216
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:24,332
they go? >> KHLOE: Yeah.

217

excuse me.

What about...
KHLOE: Right there?

220

SCOTT: Hmm.

KRIS: What do we think? Wow.

222
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,332
SCOTT: Something to think about.

223
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,599
KHLOE: Okay, so we definitely
have to tell Kris about the

224
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,632
prank soon, because she's, she's
trying to get them appraised.

225
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,132
This isn't gonna go well.
SCOTT: I know.

226
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,366
We do have to break it
to her that we're completely

227
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,099
lying, art-shaming her...
KHLOE: Oh.

228
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,366
SCOTT: And basically
giving her fraudulent paintings.

229
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:54,132
(Khloe laughs)
KRIS: We could put the other

230
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:55,666
one right there instead of that
girl.

231
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,232
Ryan Seacrest would call those
placeholders.

232
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,766
KHLOE: I know they look good.
KRIS: Oh.

233
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,666
KHLOE: She just art-shamed me
again.

234
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,999
SCOTT: Wow, and she brought
Ryan in the mix.

235
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,666
KHLOE (laughs): She said Ryan
would feel the same way.

236
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:10,999
We really just got to figure out
when to break the news to her.

237
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,499
SCOTT: Hopefully, she won't
be actually mad at us for this.

238
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,265
KHLOE: I have no idea how
Kris is going to react, but I'm

239
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:19,566
excited to see her expression.
SCOTT: Whatever happens,

240
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:21,700
it's gonna be interesting.

KOURTNEY: Tito Jackson is a
member of the Jackson Five.

273
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,232
We grew up with his three boys.
They've pretty much been in our

lives since preschool.
And they've always played

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,733
KHLOE: I'm getting out of here.

318
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:51,332
KIM: I got this, I got this.
KRIS: All right, here you go.

319
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,332
KIM: (bleep) Strike one.

320
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,332
(laughs) (bleep)

321
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,566
KHLOE: Mom, go closer.
KRIS (laughs): Sorry, Kim.

322
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,332
KHLOE: Go closer, Mom, just
for practice.

323
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,733
KRIS: I know what I'm doing.
KHLOE: Okay.

324
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:07,065
KRIS: Oh.
KHLOE: If it's not in this

325
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:09,366
zone, it's called a ball.
You don't get a penalty for

326
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:12,332
that. >> KIM: Okay.

327
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,099
(yelps)
KHLOE: That would have been a

328
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,165
ball, it's too low. >> KIM: Oh.

329
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:20,232
KHLOE: Jesus.
The first softball practice

330
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:24,499
is... terrifying. >> KRIS: Oh!

331
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,766
KHLOE: Run, run, run!
Mom has to get it!

332
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,766
She's over here, you moron.
(laughter)

333
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:33,466
KRIS: Oh, my God, I just peed
myself.

334
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:36,232
KHLOE: It's, like, just...
chickens with their head cut

335
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:40,499
off, running around this field.
It's not good.

336
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,366
KIM: All right, you ready?
(grunts)

337
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:46,099
KRIS: Oh!
(Kim and Kris laughing)

338
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,232
KHLOE: Mom, are you kidding?
KIM: Oh, my God, are you

339
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,766
okay? >> KRIS: No.

340
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,366
KIM: Oh, my God, did you hurt
your wrist?

341
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,366
KRIS: I did. KIM: Oh, my God.

342
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:55,599
How did you fall?
Mom, please don't break your

343
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,332
wrist. This is definitely very

344
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:03,232
underwhelming.
There's not a lot of skill here.

345
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,366
KHLOE: So, were you aiming
for Mom's head?

346
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,532
KIM: No. >> KHLOE: Oh.

347
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,199
(grunts) >> KRIS: Oh!

348
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,499
(Kim laughing)
KHLOE: Mom, are you kidding?

349
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,165
KIM: I'm not evil.
KHLOE: And the dramatic fall?

350
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,099
KIM: She was just so dramatic.

351
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,499
I don't think you should play,
Mom.

352
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,499
KRIS: Like, I'll try.
KHLOE: We can't lose another

353
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,132
player.
You guys barely have a team.

354
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:26,099
KOURTNEY: The MVP is here!
KIM: You gotta play.

355
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,499
KOURTNEY: See that?
KHLOE: I think your

356
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,532
camel toe looks...
KOURTNEY: See that?

357
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,165
KHLOE: Really lovely.
Okay, get your bat.

358
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,532
KOURTNEY: Don't talk about my
camel toe just 'cause you're

359
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,232
mad. (Whooping)

360
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:42,566
KHLOE: Go, go, go!
Run, Kourtney! Keep going!

361
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,532
KOURTNEY: I hit a home run!
KHLOE: Mom, you can't get

362
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:48,165
another ball.
KIM: I made it. I'm safe.

363
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,265
KHLOE: You can't pick up a
random ball.

364
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:52,999
KRIS: Okay. (Kourtney whoops)

365
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,566
KOURTNEY: Most valuable player!

366
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:58,532
I'm definitely the best player
of the family.

367
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,265
KHLOE: Well, there's three
people here.

368
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:02,332
KOURTNEY: I know.
KHLOE: It's you, Mom and Kim.

369
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,299
KOURTNEY: I'm the best.
(Khloe laughs)

370
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,466
(sighing)
KHLOE: So, you guys were in

371
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,299
charge of getting the group of
people here.

372
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,199
KOURTNEY: Okay, I asked Harry.

373
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,566
KHLOE: You asked today?
KOURTNEY: Yes, he's

374
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,299
considering it.
KHLOE: Right, but that's

375
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,466
not... that's not planning.
KOURTNEY: Who else?

376
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:19,399
KHLOE: You guys are just
super unorganized.

377
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,432
These guys don't know
how to play, and we're supposed

378
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:24,566
to be practicing, and
no one's even here to practice.

379
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,666
We are so screwed.
Just so you know, Kourt.

380
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,399
We're gonna get annihilated.
That's for sure.

381
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,233
We're (bleep) screwed.

382
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,099
SCOTT: Do you remember a
while back when you shamed Khloe

383
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,466
for not knowing art?
KRIS: I was excited to have

384
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,366
knowledge.
SCOTT: Today we tell Kris

385
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,199
this is a scam.
KHLOE: I just really hope my

386
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,232
mom doesn't throw us over this
balcony.

387
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,599
TJ: A-Rod?
ALEX: All right, all right.

388
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,232
KRIS: All right, so Alex is
here to give us a little

389
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,299
motivation.
ALEX: I want you to focus on

390
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,566
two things, 'cause we need to
win this game.

391
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:04,099
The Jacksons have to go down.
KRIS: Take that, Jacksons!

392
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,767
Yeah! (Laughs)

393
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,100
♪

394
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,199
SCOTT: Those are really
fancy, those necklaces.

395
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,632
KRIS: Thank you. KIM: I know.

396
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,466
I really like them.
SCOTT: Do you not really wear

397
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,466
jewelry, still? >> KIM: No.

398
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,632
SCOTT: Do you not even really
wear handbags?

399
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,366
KIM: No. KRIS: She doesn't wear

400
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:29,366
handbags, she doesn't wear
jewelry.

401
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:33,099
She barely wears clothes.
KIM (chuckles): Yeah.

402
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,199
KRIS: Do you think you'll
ever shave again?

403
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,666
SCOTT: Mm-mm.
KRIS: So, do you think that

404
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:40,366
the last time you had a clean-
shaven face when we were

405
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:43,232
together with you, that was the
last time we'll ever see Scott.

406
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:47,399
Disick, the Lord, Lord Disick?
SCOTT: Yeah. I don't know,

407
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,599
but Mason told me he doesn't
like...

408
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,499
I show him pictures of it
shaved, and he's like, "No!"

409
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,466
I can't look at you, Dad, I
can't!"

410
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,332
KRIS: What? >> SCOTT: Mm-hmm.

411
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,332
KIM: Yeah, sometimes when you
have something so stuck in your

412
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,332
mind in what you're used to...
SCOTT: And Penelope wants me

413
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,366
to grow it long.
Like a Santa Claus.

414
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:03,532
KRIS: Of course she does.
SCOTT: I just want to look

415
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,532
like a bum.
And then hop out of, like, a.

416
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,532
Lamborghini.
Really throw people off.

417
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,399
KRIS: That's your goal in life?

418
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,399
SCOTT: Pretty much.
KRIS: Those are good

419
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,399
aspirations.
SCOTT: By the way, do you

420
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,399
want to come with me and Khlo
tomorrow to lunch? At Nobu?

421
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,265
With that guy Art?
Weren't you, like, telling me

422
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:18,666
you were, like, dying to meet
the guy?

423
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,766
KIM: Yeah. I'm just trying to
think of what I'm doing

424
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,766
tomorrow.
SCOTT: We're gonna go at,

425
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:24,766
like, 1:00, I think.
KIM: I'll have to check my

426
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,666
schedule.
KRIS: I need a really big

427
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:30,399
piece of art for my dining room.
SCOTT: You want to come?

428
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,399
KRIS: Sure.
SCOTT: Cool. We would love to

429
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,432
have you there. KRIS: Thank you.

430
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:38,265
KHLOE: Who doesn't love Nobu?
Daytime drinking is always a

431
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:41,666
plus, so we're all gonna go to
lunch and... tell her.

432
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,432
SCOTT: We just need to have
them start talking, and then be

433
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,299
like, "By the way..."
KHLOE: "This is not a

434
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,599
"real..." >> SCOTT: Right.

435
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,566
KHLOE: "artist."
SCOTT: It's always kind of

436
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:51,532
rough when a prank comes to an
end.

437
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:52,733
KHLOE: I'm gonna miss
painting, our late nights.

438
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,532
SCOTT: Well, that doesn't
have to end.

439
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,265
KHLOE: Oh, okay.
SCOTT: Kind of freaks me out

440
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:58,265
all the time we put into stuff
like this.

441
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:02,299
KHLOE: I... (laughing)

442
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,165
KIM: I had the craziest dream
last night.

443
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,566
I've been having crazy dreams
about North.

444
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:07,232
SCOTT: Me, too.
Oh, not about North, but...

445
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,399
KIM: One was that she was
missing, and that you guys...

446
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,999
KRIS: Oh., ,
KIM: And Kylie, everyone

447
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,299
was just swimming in the pool,
and I cussed you guys all out,

448
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,699
'cause she was, like, legit
missing.

449
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,432
And then I found her in our
front yard, her and Penelope,

450
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:20,432
with a homeless man, and he had
given them alcohol and they all

451
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:22,999
were passed out.
SCOTT (laughs): Oh, my God,

452
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,032
that's weird. >> KIM: I know.

453
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:29,199
It's traumatizing. (Laughter)

KHLOE: You look so cute.
KRIS: He's my secret weapon.

This is our secret weapon.
KOURTNEY: No. You know I'm

COREY: I won't choke.
KHLOE: We are at our second

practice, and now my mom is
sitting this one out, because

461
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:55,699
her wrist hurts from her
dramatic fall.

You're not?

KHLOE: No, I'm not playing.
Fortunately, a friend of mine

467
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:05,699
connected me with Lisa.
Lisa's a coach of the women's

468

team at UCLA.
She was also in the Olympics for

469
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,766
softball.
If I can't play, at least I'm

470
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:14,332
gonna come in with guns blazing
for everybody else.

471
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,766
You guys, this is Lisa.
She is gonna kind of help steer

about you?

KENDALL: I'm literally built
as an athlete.

478
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:38,466
Every blood test I've ever done
has said that I am, like, over

479
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:41,733
the normal limit of
athleticness.

ground balls to be hit to you?

I may have spoken too soon,

because now I'm seeing everybody
practicing, they're hitting

504

some balls, going to the
outfield.

505

Seems like we might...
stand a chance

exactly...

question. >> KRIS: Mm-hmm?

while back when you shamed Khloe

for not knowing art...
KRIS: Yeah.

571
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,265
SCOTT: And making her feel
so insecure about herself?

572

KRIS: I was excited to have
knowledge.

573
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,032
SCOTT: Long story short, when
you were shaming her, we were

574
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:35,165
deciding how to shame you.
And Art Vandelay's name is Dick.

575
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,165
(Khloe and Richardson laughing)
And that art that you love so

576
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:39,032
much... >> KRIS: No!

577
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:41,265
SCOTT: Khloe and I made
in her garage.

578
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:43,367
KRIS: What?

579
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:49,999
I brought my secret weapon.
I still have one little trick up

580
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,265
my sleeve. >> TJ: No!

581
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:56,032
JUSTIN: There's been so many
people that have said nice

582
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:58,065
things, but you guys actually
have created results.

while back when you shamed Khloe

587

for not knowing art...
KRIS: Yeah.

588
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,199

596
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:33,699
KHLOE: "Khloe and I."
was an art director.

00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,766
KRIS (laughs): You made the art?

598
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,399

I have never painted a thing in

602
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:50,232
KRIS: What?
You guys are such pieces of

You had me! Ah!"

605
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,466

It's like watching, you know,

606
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:04,532
one of those, like, bad daytime
dramas.

607
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,466
Episodes? SCOTT: No, it wasn't.

608
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,065
(Khloe mimics rimshot)
SCOTT: Pow!

609
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,065
KRIS: Kim even said to me
Kanye's interested in your art.

610
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,733
SCOTT: Oh, yeah, she was in
on it.

611
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:13,666

love to buy art from me, I'll

612
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,499
start making some.
SCOTT: By the way, Matthew

613
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,132
was in on it, too. KRIS: What?

614
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:20,232
No wonder my designers made me
put it in MJ's room.

615
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:22,232

KRIS: Stop.

617
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,499
SCOTT: You just got shamed.
(Richardson laughs)

618
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,632
KRIS: You guys, I can't even
be mad, because this is so good.

619
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:33,666
Like, I would... I would be proud
of myself if I could pull this

620
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:36,032
off. Yay, Khloe and Scott.

621
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:37,766
RICHARDSON: Well done.
SCOTT: And Art.

622
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,766
KRIS: You had me this time.
This one, I didn't see this

623
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:44,499
coming.
And that's what makes me so mad,

624
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,099
is that I know it's gonna happen
again.

625
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,132
SCOTT: It sure is.
KRIS: I don't even know if

626
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:51,632
I'm being pranked right now.
Like, is Art Vandelay really

627
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:53,999
real?
And you're, like, trying to

628
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,566
reverse psychology?
RICHARDSON: Cheers to you.

629
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:59,165
KRIS: Yeah.
RICHARDSON: Aw, cheers to

630
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:00,766
you. >> SCOTT: L'chaim.

631
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:02,632
KHLOE: L'chaim.
SCOTT: Like they say in the

632
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:06,199
old country. (Khloe yipping)

633
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,132
KHLOE: Like they say in Armenia.

634
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:09,666
SCOTT: (laughs) I think
that's Mexico.

635
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:12,265
KRIS: Scott... KHLOE: Whatever.

636
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:14,533
♪

637
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,299
KRIS: What's going on here,
guys?

638
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,132
JUSTIN: Yeah, we're just
gonna have fun.

639
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:28,999
Show you a little bit of what
we've been up to.

640
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,666
KRIS: Yes.
JUSTIN: Corey, this is my

641
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,999
friend Noah.
NOAH: What's up, man? Noah.

642
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,699
KRIS: Hi. How are you?
I'm so excited.

643
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,566
JUSTIN: We've never had a
basketball court outdoor in this

644
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,666
area of Watts.
KRIS: I'm so impressed.

645
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:45,165
JUSTIN: Yeah.
KRIS: This is so fantastic.

646
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:48,165
JUSTIN: Years and years ago,
uh, they had some stuff over

647
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,566
here, but we were like, "Let's
put it on the backside."

648
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:53,566
So, with drive-bys and so forth
at nighttime, that they're

649
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,566
protected by the building, it's
not a target, and it's like...

650
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:59,299
But let's do it actually proper.
So it's, honestly, a full

651
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,199
basketball court. >> KRIS: Stop.

652
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,766
TAUNA: They're doing, um, the
rebar up and everything that

653
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,199
goes down and then the cement.
And then we'll come in and paint

654
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,733
lines and put the hoops up.
They've been working around the

655
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:14,199
clock, so... >> KRIS: Amazing.

656
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,566
I've reached out to a few
companies, asking for help with

657
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:22,032
the kitchen renovation and the
gym renovation, the basketball

658
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,299
court.
A lot of people have already

659
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,399
chipped in and donated.
TAUNA: For Adidas, our belief

660
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,733
is that, through sport, we have
the power to change lives.

661
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:33,199
And we feel like creating safe
places to play for kids is

662
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,399
life-changing.
KRIS: Adidas has been

663
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,632
amazing, because they've agreed
to do the entire outdoor play

664
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:41,199
area.
And other companies are doing

665
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,733
the inside. I'm so impressed.

666
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:45,599
JUSTIN: Yeah.
KRIS: Getting the concrete

667
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,265
poured for the future basketball
court is my dream come true for

668
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:53,065
them. Who owns these buildings?

669
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,232
JUSTIN: It's government
subsidized housing, so it's the.

670
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,132
Housing Authority of Los
Angeles.

671
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:59,766
Uh, so, yeah, it's, like, the
second largest in all of.

672
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,366
America. New York and then here.

673
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,666
KRIS: I'm really excited
about all the progress that's

674
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:07,199
being made, and I'm so
optimistic that this is going to

675
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,766
make the community a better
place.

676
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:10,399
Hi. >> BRUNO: How are you?

677
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,232
I'm Bruno Marchesi.
KRIS: Kris. Nice to see you.

678
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:14,099
BRUNO: Very nice to meet you.
KRIS: Thank you so much for

679
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,766
being a part of this.
BRUNO: No, thank you.

680
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:17,699
KRIS: It's so amazing.
BRUNO: It's about giving kids

681
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,699
safe places to play...
KRIS: Right?

682
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,366
BRUNO: And the opportunity
to be successful.

683
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:23,166
That's what it's about.

684
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:28,099
JUSTIN: Kids, they honestly
think they're born and are gonna

685
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,165
die here.
We had one person, uh, that was

686
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:35,432
shot and killed, uh, one block
away, uh, two weeks ago.

687
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:39,366
And then, last week, uh, maybe
12 blocks away, there was two

688
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:42,432
people shot and killed and six,
uh... no, six shot and two

689
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:48,632
killed.
SISTA: Some of our kids in

690
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:52,199
our community, either their
father in prison or deceased.

691
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,265
I lost two kids in 60 days.
KRIS: Oh, my God.

692
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:57,265
SISTA: That's how I met Justin.

693
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,666
This is a dream.
Whatever we wanted, you did it.

694
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:03,265
And I just want to say thank you
for everything and working hard

695
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:06,999
with Yang and his staff and
with Red Eye.

696
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,065
KRIS: We're so proud to be a
part of this, so thank you for

697
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:12,265
allowing us to be a part of your
family.

698
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:15,699
All the things that are
happening are going to be really

699
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,199
terrific for the kids.
The ability to come someplace

700
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,132
and have a really safe
environment with really loving

701
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:26,999
people can make a big difference
in a community that's otherwise

702
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,165
going to be left behind.
KRIS: See you.

703
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:34,032
(Kris laughs)
KHLOE: The opposing team is

704
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,032
here. >> KOURTNEY: Hey, Papa T.

705
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:38,032
TITO: Hey, babe.
KOURTNEY: How are you?

706
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,499
TITO: All right, sweetheart.
How are you?

707
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,432
KOURTNEY: Good. So good to
see you.

708
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:44,032
KHLOE: Hello.
KRIS: Hey, everybody, listen

709
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:46,466
up. Alex Rodriguez.

710
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:49,032
KIM: My mom really pulled it
together.

711
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:52,699
I think we have a real shot
here.

712
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,232
(screams)
CROWD: Three, two, one!

713
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:01,232
(all cheer)
KRIS: I can't wait to see all

714
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:03,232
the hard work that was put into
the center.

715
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:05,199
JUSTIN: They wouldn't even
let me see in here 'cause they

716
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,232
wanted me to be surprised.
What the...? Whoa!

717
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,233
KRIS: Oh, my God.

718
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:16,132
KHLOE: It's game time, kids.
KRIS: Let's play ball.

719
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:19,366
KHLOE: Hey, you guys.
COREY: Fired up today.

720
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:23,566
KHLOE: We came up with the
name Calabasas Peaches because,

721
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:28,332
A League of Their Own.
The opposing team is here.

722
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,466
(Jonathan laughs)
Hi, how are you?

723
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:32,466
TITO: You know Andrew.
KHLOE: How are you?

724
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:34,399
ANDREW: Oh, you look good.
KHLOE: Oh, thank you.

725
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,232
I'm not playing, but...
ANDREW: Look at you.

726
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:38,132
KHLOE: I'm here for support.
KOURTNEY: Hey, Papa T.

727
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:39,466
TITO: Hey, babe.
KOURTNEY: How are you?

728
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:41,466
TITO: All right, sweetheart.
How are you?

729
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,265
KOURTNEY: Good. So good to
see you.

730
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:46,099
KHLOE: Hello. How are you?
TITO: I'm okay.

731
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,065
KOURTNEY: Mom, are you
playing, or are you...?

732
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:50,099
KRIS: No. I brought my secret
weapon.

733
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,232
He's gonna be pulling up in
about five minutes.

734
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:56,265
We still don't have a full team,
even after the second practice.

735
00:31:56,266 --> 00:32:00,366
So I've recruited a few more
people to round out this squad.

736
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:03,366
But I still have one little
trick up my sleeve.

737
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,999
On the field, guys.
Right now, please.

738
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,132
And just stay there until you
hear from me later.

739
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:10,099
JONATHAN: What is she so
excited about?

740
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,999
LISA: We're waiting for someone.

741
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,532
KRIS: Where is he? Is he coming?

742
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,366
JONATHAN: What's the surprise?

743
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,265
KRIS: My ace in the hole. Yay.

744
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:21,032
Thank you, God. Oh, my God.

745
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:23,032
ALEX: What's up, baby?
KRIS: I'm so happy to see

746
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:24,499
you. ALEX: How are you, honey?

747
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,499
Good to see you.
KRIS: Thank you.

748
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,399
I know you're busy.
ALEX: No worries.

749
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,366
KRIS: And you're trying to
run your empire from the road,

750
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,366
but I am...
ALEX: You look great.

751
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,232
KRIS: Thank you.
ALEX: I love the uni. Yeah.

752
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:36,165
KRIS: Look. ALEX: Looking sharp.

753
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:38,065
Looking sharp.
KRIS: Professional shoes.

754
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:41,299
JONATHAN: What?
KRIS: Hey, everybody.

755
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,532
Listen up. Alex Rodriguez.

756
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:48,299
A-Rod is here to be our coach.
TJ: A-Rod? No!

757
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,299
KRIS: Take that, Jacksons.
Yeah. He is here to help coach

758
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,165
the girls today and bring in the
win for the Calabasas Peaches.

759
00:32:57,166 --> 00:33:00,199
Bam!
All right, so, Alex is here to

760
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,466
give us a little motivation,
inspiration.

761
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:04,399
He's the most amazing
motivational speaker.

762
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,265
ALEX: Wow.
KRIS: He does this all over

763
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:08,132
the world.
ALEX: I want you to focus on

764
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:10,065
two things, 'cause we need to
win this game.

765
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:12,265
The Jacksons have to go down,
okay?

766
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:14,199
KRIS: That's right, yeah!
(all cheering)

767
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,299
ALEX: So, two things.
Number one thing I want you to

768
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,432
focus on... very simple... look at
the baseball and do not stop

769
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:24,332
looking at the baseball.
Now, number two: I created this

770
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:28,466
bat to hit home runs.
All you have to do is tap, tap,

771
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,499
tap, tap. (Imitates explosion)

772
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,432
And the ball will explode.
LISA: Got it. Got it.

773
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:34,232
ALEX: See the ball and tap.
KHLOE: And have a little bit

774
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:36,065
of fun.
ALEX: And have a little bit

775
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:38,065
of fun.
KIM: Having Alex Rodriguez

776
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:41,466
here is so major.
My mom really pulled it

777
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:44,366
together.
I think we have a real shot

778
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:47,332
here.
ALEX: Dear God, help us all

779
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,165
play like New York Yankees.
(all laughing, cheering)

780
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:52,366
KRIS: Yeah! (Whoops)

781
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:56,432
JONATHAN: Good morning,
Calabasas, and welcome to the.

782
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:59,232
Southern California Baseball
Academy Field.

783
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:02,733
It's the perfect weather for
today's family game between two

784
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:08,265
equally fire teams: The
Calabasas Peaches and Tito's.

785
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:10,466
Team. (All cheering)

786
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,332
Guys, let's play some softball.
First at bat, TJ.

787
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,366
KHLOE: Wait, so we're in
the field first?

788
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:18,232
I thought we just sit.
I was gonna go eat.

789
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:22,332
(all laugh) >> LARSA: You suck!

790
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,632
TJ: Yeah! (Kim screams)

791
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:26,632
KHLOE: Nice.
JONATHAN: Batting second,

792
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:28,632
Royal. Hit something hard.

793

00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,566
Let's have a little fun.
Okay, so, guys, this is the

953
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:51,566
kitchen.
They wouldn't even let me see in

954
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:53,566
here, 'cause they wanted me to
be surprised.

955
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,566
What the...? Whoa!
KRIS: Oh, my God.

956
00:41:55,567 --> 00:41:57,566
This is so great.
JUSTIN: I was not expect...

957
00:41:57,567 --> 00:42:02,165
Wow. KRIS: Aw, this is so good.

958
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,199
PATRICK: This is... you know,
this is our youth, this is the

959
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,432
next generation.
Thank you very much for allowing

960
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:08,566
us to be part.
KRIS: It's an honor to be

961
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:12,032
involved, it truly is.
KOURTNEY: Of course.

962
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:14,165
KRIS: I can't be more
thrilled about the way

963
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,466
everything turned out.
Bluprint really went over and

964
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,165
beyond with their donation
towards the new kitchen.

965
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:21,466
JUSTIN: This is our STEM
media lab.

966
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:25,199
KRIS: This is so good.
The new media lab will really

967
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,065
bring educational opportunities
to the youth of Watts.

968
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:31,199
JUSTIN: Something that we
heard over and over from the

969
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,099
community when we were trying to
figure out how to make this all

970
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,232
happen... they just want to feel
a sense of home when they walk

971
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:38,199
here, 'cause, to be honest, lots
of them don't have a typical

972
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,632
home setting.
KRIS: I'm really proud of

973
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:44,466
everybody who contributed and
got behind this whole cause.

974
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:48,065
It's overwhelming.
MARVEON: Thank you.

975
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,599
Can I give you a hug?
KRIS: Oh, yes, thank you.

976
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,065
MARVEON: Thank you for
believing in underprivileged

977
00:42:54,066 --> 00:42:56,199
communities like ours.
KRIS: So good. Thank you.

978
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,065
KIM: I am so proud of my mom,
that she's really taken on this

979
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:01,199
project. What's your name?

980
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,366
DAVANTE: Davante.
KIM: Nice to meet you,

981
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:05,632
Davante.
It just makes me so happy to see

982
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:07,666
that these kids can get off the
streets and know that they're

983
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:10,099
safe and have fun.
KOURTNEY: Thank you.

984
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,532
That was such a nice hug.
KIM: Even though my mom has

985
00:43:13,533 --> 00:43:17,232
gotten so many amazing sponsors
and people to renovate the Watts.

986
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:19,766
Center, there's definitely so
much more work that has to be

987
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:22,632
done. KRIS: I really hope that

988
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,632
people can step up and keep
giving and contributing, 'cause

989
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:28,265
I'd like to see it just grow and
grow.

990
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:30,532
JUSTIN: Come on, come on.
Are you joking?

991
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:33,766
Little man, all day long.
Yeah, that's you.

992
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:36,099
KRIS: Hey.
JUSTIN: Hello. Hello. Hello.

993
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,499
KRIS: Hi.
WOMAN: Can I see some big

994
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,632
smiles? Keeping Up

995
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,699
with the Kardashians...
WOMAN: I'm so happy for you.

996
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,165
KIM: Ooh, so pretty!
KHLOE: I literally feel like

997
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,532
I'm dreaming.
There's no way that this baby

998
00:43:49,533 --> 00:43:53,132
shower is for me.
KYLIE: Nothing in my closet

999
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:55,132
fits me. I'm just getting, like,

1000
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,566
comfortable with my body again
since Stormi, and it's kind of

1001
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:00,532
discouraging.
KIM: Are you ready to march

1002
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:02,699
today? >> NORTH: I'm ready.

1003
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,032
KIM: If we just speak up and
get things done, I think we can

1004
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:08,532
change the world for the better.
