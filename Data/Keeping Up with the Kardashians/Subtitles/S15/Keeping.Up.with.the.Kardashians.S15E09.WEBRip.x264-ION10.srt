320

I'm trying to figure out how to

324
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:51,265
surprise Sheila with a facelift.
When I had my face done, that

325
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:54,265
was really a hard thing for me
to go through.

326

And who was there every single
step of the way?

327
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,099
Sheila.
It just occurred to me, like,

328
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,399
she's wanted to do this for
years, but this is just not

329
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,666
something she would do.
I want to do this for her and be

330
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:10,399
there for her like she's always
been there for me.

331
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,265
I'm so excited.
SCOTT: You're giving her a

332
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:13,699
facelift?
KRIS: Like, I want to jump up

333
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,132
and down.
I'm so excited, that I just,

334
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:20,232
she's been such an amazing
friend, and she's just always

335
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,165
there for me.
SCOTT: I mean, even though

336
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,366
it's really a sweet gesture, are
you at all nervous that you

337
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:27,632
could offend her in any way?
KRIS: Like...

338
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:31,099
SCOTT: Is it, like, "Hey,
your face looks old"?

339
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,499
Just think about it.
KRIS: Scott's getting in my

340
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,265
head and making me feel like
this is a mistake, and all I'm

341
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:41,299
really trying to do is show her
how much I love her.

didn't, I would definitely go

was.

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,532
KRIS: I think so. Yeah.
SHEILA: Yeah.

478
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,366
KRIS: Red, white and black.
And Sheila had on the red

479
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:28,632
earrings to match.
SHEILA: Well, we've been

480
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:31,265
through a lot, all of us
together.

481
00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:38,499
KRIS: Um, well...
I have a surprise for you.

482
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,766
I know my girlfriend better than
anybody else, especially better

483
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,232
than Scott.
But I have to be really careful

484
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:49,265
with Sheila because she's so
kind, and she's so sweet and

485
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:53,132
she never wants to hurt
anybody's feelings, so she might

486
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:58,632
be inclined to say, "Okay, thank
you," even if she really doesn't

487
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:03,399
want it.
And it's making me nervous.

488
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,132
Uh, Joyce already knows, but...
SHEILA: What do you know?

489
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:14,399
KRIS: I have arranged for
Garth Fisher to do whatever you

490
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,165
want him to do.
SHEILA: You're kidding,

491
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,666
right?
KRIS: On your face and your

492
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,132
neck. >> SHEILA: Stop.

493
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:21,065
KRIS: Yeah. Yeah.
JOYCE: So what do you think?

494
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:24,399
SHEILA: Stop. No. Come on.
KRIS: Would you do it?

495
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,065
I mean, I just said yes.
SHEILA: Yes. Yes!

496
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:29,265
(Kris laughs)
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

497
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:31,132
JOYCE: She booked you.
You're going.

498
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:32,666
KRIS: Yeah, yeah, she's going.

499
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,265
SHEILA: But wait...
KRIS: And Joyce and I are

500
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:35,999
going with you.
SHEILA: Can you be with me?

501
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,232
KRIS: Of course, we already
booked ourselves.

502
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:38,999
SHEILA: Stop.
JOYCE: We're booked out.

503
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,165
SHEILA: Oh, my... stop.
KRIS: 'Cause if you're not

504
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,265
gonna use it, we will.
JOYCE: We will.

505
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:45,332
(laughter) >> SHEILA: What?

506
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:48,432
KRIS: I feel super relieved
that Sheila's so excited about

507
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,299
her surgery.
I really am because I never want

508
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,065
to feel like I pushed her into
doing something she wasn't ready

509
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:56,432
for. >> SHEILA: Wow.

510
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:59,199
KRIS: We are so excited.
Joyce and I were like... we

511
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,666
couldn't sleep last night.
JOYCE: I'm so excited for

512
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,165
you. >> SHEILA: Oh, my God.

513
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,599
KRIS: Isn't this exciting?
SHEILA: He-he's the best.

514
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,332
JOYCE: He is the best.
SHEILA: The best.

515
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:09,599
KRIS: The whole day he booked
out for you.

516
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,165
SHEILA: I can't believe it.
That is beyond.

517
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:15,599
KRIS: Anybody have any
Kleenex by any chance?

518
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,733
SHEILA: This is clean, it's
just...

519
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:21,332
KRIS: Oh, no.
(laughing): No, I don't know.

520
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,165
SHEILA: I-I'm trying to be nice.

521
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:26,065
JOYCE: She used it once.
SHEILA: Well, no, I stuffed

522
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,466
it in here and it's from this
morning.

523
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:29,065

that one.

Does anyone have that picture?

526
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:50,065
KOURTNEY: What picture?
STYLIST 2: We're building a

527
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:51,033
case for you.
ANDREW: Stuff that Kim was

528
00:28:51,034 --> 00:28:53,199
saying to you.
She literally came for

529
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,199
everybody.
Can't really say (bleep).

530
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,199
KOURTNEY: No, after
yesterday, I wanted to wear a

531
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,499
white T-shirt and jeans.
ANDREW: Oh, for real.

532
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,666
STYLIST 2: And she's like,
"Oh, my God, fur coats are the

"worst," and I'm like, okay.
(laughter)

Burn all my clothes.
KOURTNEY: Hello? I have three

535
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,666
children and a full-time job.
I'm not gonna do... I don't have

536
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:11,766
seven stylists. (Laughter)

537
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:15,099
KIM: Kourtney and all of the
glam people at this point hate

538
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,366
me 'cause I've just killed all
their dreams.

539
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:19,366
KOURTNEY: Big shoulders are
awful. How rude.

540
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:22,232
STYLIST: I don't give a
(bleep), honey. (Laughs)

541

KIM: And I don't care.
KOURTNEY: You're so (bleep)

542
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,699
jealous.
STYLIST 2: (bleep) rude.

543
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,265
(laughter)
KIM: If you can't take the

544
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:33,366
criticism, you shouldn't have
come on this trip.

545
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:36,265
Kourtney? Ooh, what a cute room.

546
00:29:36,266 --> 00:29:40,399
I would've done a photo shoot
right there.

547
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,366
KOURTNEY: You missed out.
KIM: Um, well, I just wanted

548
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:48,265
to say, like, I know that I've
been, like, kind of snappy and

549
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:54,399
just, like, very opinionated,
but I'm here for the Yeezy

550
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,132
campaign.
I don't have time to be, like,

551
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,399
beating around the bush here.
KOURTNEY: But I feel like

552
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,399
we're also here to, like, have
fun, wear some fun stuff, do

553
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,432
some fun hair and makeup,
whatever.

554
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:07,699
And by the way, I have liked all
my outfits.

555
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,532
KIM: I don't know.
I saw what I saw and I saw

556
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:12,532
(bleep) clowns.
KOURTNEY: Nobody wants to

557
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:17,532
wake up and be criticized from
head to toe, like, the whole day

558
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,999
long. KIM: But the old Kourtney

559
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,432
would've been like, "(bleep)
you," or, like, "Whatever."

560
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,299
You know?
KOURTNEY: So would you rather

561
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,532
me just say, like, your (bleep)
outfits suck?

562
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,165
You're wearing a puffy vest.
You have pink hair and, like,

563
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:32,332
turquoise shoes.
I didn't come here to wear

564
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,299
leggings that are see-through
and show my ass off.

565
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,466
(Khloe laughs)
Do you know how easy it is to be

566
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:40,032
a bitch?
I could be a bitch all (bleep)

567
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:42,733
day if that's what you want.
But guess what?

568
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:46,432
It takes a lot more courage to
show your feelings than to sit

569
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:50,432
there and be a bitch.
KRIS: I'm personally praying

570
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,432
for you.

nervous. I hate this part.

574

KIM: This is what gives me
anxiety in life.

575
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,432
I'm starting to freak out
because there's so many looks

576
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:13,499
that we haven't shot yet.
We really have one shot.

577
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,232
Right here, right there.
Stop, stop, stop. Stop here.

578

579

saying she wanted something
where she could pass it down,

generation.
