KHLOE: Kourtney and I have a

00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,432
really special bond.
I haven't felt that from her in

I don't understand, I told them

all my carbs, and somebody gave

honestly just horrible.

21

KHLOE: Five next week.

25
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,366
But, hopefully, my belly will
just pop soon.

26
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:39,399
And when it does, Tristan and I
want to do a... Well, I don't

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,666
know if he wants to, but I want
to do a maternity shoot.

28
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,699
And I want to do it with him.
But I want that to, like,

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,666
announce that I'm (bleep)
pregnant.

30
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:54,499
I am really anxious to announce
my pregnancy, but Kylie's three

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,499
months ahead of me, and I want
to give her her own time to

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,733
shine and let her do her thing.
But Kylie keeps going back and

33
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:05,666
forth about announcing, or if
she will or won't announce.

34
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:09,733
And waiting is so frustrating
because my body is changing, and

35
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:13,399
people are super invasive and
they're just not being

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,065
respectful.
Everyone's, like, trying to,

37

like, bump into me to feel
something.

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,399
And I just think it's so rude
and... I don't like it at all.

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,999
And nothing fits me right now
'cause I lost all my weight and

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,432
I looked good, so I wanted to
wear everything tight that

41
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,666
showed my body.
So I don't have, like, a lot of

KRIS: Yeah.

are you just hungry?"

Are you gold and glittery?

it's like to have a busy"

316
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,099
schedule.
You have nothing to do."

317
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,232
Like, just, like, going crazy,
then she's like, "You're the"

318

"least interesting one to look
at," I mean...

319

thing to say.

And, like, really?

Internet?

322
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,265
Do you see what people say about
me compared to you?

323
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,366

Like, you have cellulite

324
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,132

have it in me anymore.

327

KENDALL: Yeah.
KOURTNEY: Since I've been

KENDALL: No, but I feel like

talk to?

338

don't have my back with things.

339
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:57,666
Like Kim, just out of the blue,
sends me these, like, text

340
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:01,199
messages, telling me that she
thinks that I need to invite.

341
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,265
Scott.
KENDALL: It should be Younes

342
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:06,165
going to the party and Scott
coming to Christmas morning.

343
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,566
KOURTNEY: Yeah.
KENDALL: Like, that's how it

344
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,532
should be.
KOURTNEY: But, like, why is.

345
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:13,199
Scott coming to the party more
important than my feelings?

346
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,432
KENDALL: Mm.
That conversation made me so mad

347
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,199
the other night.
KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

348
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,165
It's just because they're
friends with him, so they think

349
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,165
that they can tell me...
KENDALL: Yeah, but you were

350
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,165
in a relationship with him, and
you have your reasoning for not

351
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,666
wanting him to be there, and so
does Mom.

352
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:29,265
But it just blew my mind that no
one understood the comparison

353
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:30,432
of, like, my dad.
KOURTNEY: Yeah.

354

KOURTNEY: And I just said,

like, I can figure out my
situation.

357
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:40,299

taking the kids away for.

Why would you go away?

360
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,466
I wouldn't go away.
KOURTNEY: I've been thinking

361
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:55,199
that if my sisters are just so
inconsiderate about how I'm

362

remove myself from the situation

conversation like that, okay.

471
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,599
And then she was like, "Me and
Kendall were talking about you."

472
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,165
She goes, "You're really scared
about how your life is gonna"

473
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:49,499
"turn out." >> KIM: What a freak.

474
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,699
KHLOE: She thinks I'm scared,
and that's why I'm acting out,

475
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,999
'cause I don't want to let my
old life go. What?

476
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,499
KIM: She's so off.
KHLOE: I just was blown away

477
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,132
by her. Now she's just absurd.

478
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,733
KIM: Absurd. KHLOE: Absurd.

479
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:05,132
KIM: Absurd.
KHLOE: And 'cause she...

480
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,232
Kourtney was like, "Kendall
agrees with me."

481
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:09,733
KIM: No one understands us
like us.

482
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:12,099
KHLOE: What are we gonna do?
'Cause it's hard for me to...

483
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,065
like, even be around her at this
point.

484
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:16,632
KIM: We should just call
Kendall 'cause, like, I just

485
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,532
don't get why she's such a
freak.

486
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:21,999
(phone ringing)
KHLOE: Hey, how much (bleep)

487
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,599
were you talking about me on a
scale from one to ten?

488
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,999
KENDALL: Um, we weren't
talking that much (bleep).

489
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,199
KIM: The fact that you even
hang out with Kourtney, you're

490
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,733
such a (bleep) freak.
KENDALL: What?

491
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:34,699
KIM: I'm just kidding.
KENDALL: Why?

492
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,632
Kourt is my best friend right
now.

493
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:38,632
KHLOE: Kim is my best friend
right now. So...

494
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:40,999
KIM: I question your morals.
KENDALL: Why?

495
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,099
KIM: I question your humanity.

496
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,032
KENDALL: She told me she's
going out of town with the kids

497
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,632
for the holidays. KHLOE: What?

498
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,766
KIM: What?
KENDALL: I thought that was

499
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,766
weird, but I tried to convince
her out of it a little bit.

500
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:53,532
KIM: Like, that is just the
wildest thing.

501
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:57,032
KHLOE: It's not okay.
KENDALL: No. Well, I think

502
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:58,766
she'll end up coming...
KIM: But do you think it's

503
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,632
like a cry for help?
Like-like a cry for attention?

504
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:04,766
Is she the new Rob?
KENDALL: Yeah, that is

505
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:07,099
possible.
KHLOE: It makes me sad if

506
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,099
she's not coming.
'Cause I'm just gonna miss the

507
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,099
kids and just the tradition of
it all.

508
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,632
I just think, given everything
that's gone on, the last thing

509
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:16,666
we need is separation like this.
And for Kourtney to say she

510
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:19,165
doesn't think she's gonna spend
Christmas with us, it's just so

511
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,666
excessive.
It's, like, ridiculous at this

512
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,666
point.
The divide is gonna get worse

513
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:27,599
and worse the more time that we
just ignore what's really going

514
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,999
on.
Every time we talk about her I

515
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,132
get more upset.
KIM: She drives me so crazy.

516
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,332

do.

KOURTNEY: I don't want to do

And then we'll go home together
