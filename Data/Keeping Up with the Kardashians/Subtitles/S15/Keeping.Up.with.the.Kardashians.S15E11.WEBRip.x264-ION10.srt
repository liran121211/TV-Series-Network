JAMMAL: Parkland was, like,

of how fast people mobilized and

place in the world with this
raging epidemic.

611
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,632
Clearly, it's preventable.
People in between the ages of 18

612
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:53,132
and 29, if they all got out
there and voted, they would make

613
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:55,532
the decision that election.
CAMERON: What we're trying to

614
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:58,532
do is to make voting more
ingrained in pop culture, more

615
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:01,132
ingrained in its being cool.
KIM: I still don't know

616
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,065
(bleep) about voting.
I literally only know the

00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:06,332
president election every four
years, and that's it.

618
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,399

KIM: So when people say,

619
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,165
like, "Get out and vote," like,
what is there to vote on?

620

CAMERON: Every two years, we
have the opportunity to

completely reshape the House of
Representatives and a lot of

622
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:19,599

November 6, there is going to

623
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,666

can solve gun violence.

624
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:26,199
KIM: Kanye always says he
wants to have more kids, and I

625
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,566
was like, "I just can't."
Like, there's... our world

626
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:31,332
is so (bleep) up, and then we
were there, I was like, wait a

627
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:35,599
minute, I feel like the whole
next generation is so together

628
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,299
and is gonna change the world,
and, like, we can have another

629
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,099

631
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,599
just, I felt like...
it was so...

632
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,232
just powerful.

KHLOE: Scott, can we just do
this a little later?

793
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:04,099
SCOTT: So let's get serious.
I do want you to get your bed

794
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,999
rest, but we started this pod
and I don't want to ruin it.

795
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,032
How about you give me a solid 14
minutes of good energy and you

796
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:15,132
go take a 14-hour nap?
KHLOE: Scott.

797
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:17,132
SCOTT: 12 minutes.
KHLOE: I don't have good

798
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:20,432
energy.
SCOTT: Do you really want to

799
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:22,132
bring a child into this world
with this kind of energy?

800
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,132
KHLOE: No, and that's why I
need to take a nap.

801
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:25,999
SCOTT: Oh!
KHLOE: And if you would let

802
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,666
me take a nap, there would be
much better energy, but you're

803
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,699
not letting me take a nap, and
I'm at my wit's end, and...

804
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,699
SCOTT: Podcasters, this is
what it's like dealing with a

805
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,399
pregnant woman.
Get ready, people. (Laughs)

806
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,132
KHLOE: Don't make me throw
this at your face and chip your

807
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:38,265
tooth.
SCOTT: I don't want a chipped

808
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:40,099
tooth.
KHLOE: Stop talking in the

at this point.

SCOTT: Why do you keep
putting the mic up, then?

811

used to it, 'cause that's what

minutes ago.

815

because you're too big to swim.

come to terms that not only is
