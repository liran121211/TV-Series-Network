contemporary.

163
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,566

We need to fill up a 5,000-foot

164
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,999

I like these marble tables.

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,299
That could be cool.
I just have a passion for

166
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,999
flipping houses, so being able
to make an actual career out of

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,299

00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:03,699
AMBER: Embalming is,
essentially, making an incision

636
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,999
here, it's pulling up the
artery, it's opening it up, it's

637
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,165
putting an arterial tube in
it...

638
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:13,432
It's pushing embalming fluid
through your body.

639
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:17,432
So you're flushing out all of
the blood, because the blood is

640
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:20,032
what starts the decomposition
process.

641
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:22,299
MARIO: I always wondered
about this, too.

642
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,432
Like, let's say, God forbid,
that she passes away.

643
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:27,466
Like, what if her eyeball or
something opens? Like...

644
00:30:27,467 --> 00:30:29,699
AMBER: So, it's essentially a
contact lens that has little

645
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,466
pebbly things on it, and so,
when I take a body, I open the

646
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:36,065
eyelid, I put that on, and then
you put the eyelid over it, and

647
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:38,165
essentially, it holds the eyelid
down, so her eyelids aren't

648
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,332
gonna be popping up.
MARIO: What?

649
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,566
KIM: My stomach is turning.
I thought I was totally fine,

650
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:46,065
and all of a sudden, I'm like,
"Oh, my God, I might throw up."

651
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:48,299
AMBER: Um...
KIM: Can we sit down?

652
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,133
AMBER: Yeah.

653
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,165
KIM: What training is
involved in this?

654
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:58,065
AMBER: So I went to
Mortuary School.

655
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,299
Um, it's a three-semester
program.

656
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,432
You learn basic things, like
stuff that you already know,

657
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:05,766
like the color wheel and what
cancels out other colors.

658
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:08,065
And then, you'll build facial
features.

659
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,065
We would get clay, and we would
learn how to a build a nose,

660
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:12,199
and... >> KIM: Why?

661
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,532
AMBER: Um, because if someone
gets in a car accident, um, you

662
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:18,099
can basically rebuild their
facial features from wax.

663
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,332
KIM: Like, what if someone's,
like, shot in the head?

664
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,332
AMBER: It's easier to fix
than it sounds like.

665
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,366
Like, if it's just a simple
gunshot wound, it's just taking

666
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:27,499
filler or wax and just putting
it in, and then just, um,

667
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,199
cosmetize it. >> KIM: Wow.

668
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,232
AMBER: So, what we're going
to do, when we go into the next

669
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:34,232
room, um...
MARIO: What's in the next

670
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:36,265
room? >> KIM: I don't know.

671
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:38,265
AMBER: The next room is gonna
be us doing some makeup

672
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:40,232
together. >> MARIO: On who?

673
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:42,399
AMBER: On a person.
KIM: That's dead?

674
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,265
AMBER: You'll find out when
we go in.

675
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:48,099
KIM: We definitely asked for
the authentic experience, but

676
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,499
I'm starting to rethink this.
AMBER: Those are for you.

677
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,499
KIM: Okay, cool.
Are we gonna walk in to a dead

678
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,432
body laying on the table?
I'm just freaking out.

679
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,432
AMBER: All right, are you
guys ready?

680
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:02,632
Yeah? Excited?
MARIO: Oh, my God, my heart's

681
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:08,999
beating so fast right now. Kim.

682
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,265
KHLOE: I am about to have a
checkup with Dr. A, and I am

683
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:15,165
bringing my mom, so she can hear
it with her own ears and see it

684
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,532

She wants me to gain 80 pounds.

KHLOE: Oh. Don't lie now.

gain 80 pounds.

692
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,466
Well, she's breathing.
MARIO: Huh?

693
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:49,432
KIM: She's breathing.
Is she gonna say hi?

694
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,265
I mean, she's breathing, so...
she's not dead.

695
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:53,699
AMBER: Right. (Chuckles)
KIM: So...

696
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,265
AMBER: But she's gonna be
our... she's... she's method.

697
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,265
She's gonna be our dead body.
KIM: Hi, thank you for doing

698
00:32:59,266 --> 00:33:01,566
this for us. >> MARIO: Hello.

699
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:05,132
AMBER: So one of the things
that, um, you'll always get is

700
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:06,699
you'll get pictures of the
decedent.

701
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,165
And so, this is gonna kind of
tell me what I should work with.

702
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,699
KIM: We have the same color on.

703
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,666
Literally, the same exact color.
It's beautiful.

704
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,699
AMBER: And, actually, it's
funny, too, 'cause I bought this

705
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,566
especially for it and that was...
She's already, she's good to go.

706
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:21,566
So this is, like, some color
correction for her.

707
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,566
MARIO: How would you color
correct the blueness here?

708
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,432
AMBER: So blue, I would maybe
start by putting some yellow

709
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:26,699
over it. >> MARIO: Yellow?

710
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,366
AMBER: Yeah, I'd put yellow
here, put some yellow here.

711
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:31,232
MARIO: So could we use, like,
highlighter to make her skin

712
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:37,332
glow? >> AMBER: Mm-hmm.

713
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,499
KIM: So where are you gonna
put the highlighter, her cheek?

714
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,599
MARIO: Just, like, on her
cheeks so it makes it glow a

715
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,165
little bit.
So use the peach and I'll use

716
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:46,332
the peach on your under-eyes.
Use it here, like on her...

717
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,566
under-eyes a little bit.
KIM: So, would you use it

718
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:50,432
directly? >> AMBER: Yeah. Yeah.

719
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:54,466
MARIO: I'll do one side and
you do the other side.

720
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:59,165
Here, mix these two.
But put more of the lighter one.

721
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:02,632
KIM: Keep going.
I'll just be your assistant for

722
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:05,466
the day. Has anyone ever moved?

723
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:07,232
AMBER: (laughs) No. KIM: No?

724
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:08,733
AMBER: No.
MARIO: She needs a little bit

725
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:10,499
of eyebrow.
KIM: And then we can put

726
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,466
some, like, bronzer on top.
I could really see this as a

727
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:17,766
career for you.
I think you can handle it.

729

I'm on track for natural birth,

894

just been aware of the things

I'm putting into my body.
I think my mom hearing it

897
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:49,232
directly from Dr. A is just
really crucial for her to get it

898
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,065
through her head that this is
not me just making up random

899
