319
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,466
KHLOE: Mm-hmm.
KIM: We all communicate

320
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:41,132
really weird and we just don't
ever express what's really

321
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,399
bothering us.
We all walk on eggshells around

322
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,132
each other.
KOURTNEY: I don't think we

323
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:47,399
walk on eggshells.
KIM: Well, we're all going to

324
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,165
therapy together.
So, it's happening.

325
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,165
KOURTNEY: But why?
KIM: Because we all need to

326
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,432
communicate with a mediator, and
we don't have that mediator.

327
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,332
KOURTNEY: You guys make fun
of me for going.

328
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,432
KHLOE: We don't make fun of
you for going to therapy.

329
00:13:57,433 --> 00:14:00,466
We make fun of you for literally
hating us because of your

330
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,199
therapist now.
KOURTNEY: I don't hate you

331
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,065
because of my therapist.
KHLOE: You hate me because of

332
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,466

KOURTNEY: I don't hate you.

333
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:08,299
KHLOE: Thank you.
KOURTNEY: And my therapist

334
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,165
just said, this will start to
happen.

335
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,466
People that you're close to,
you'll probably, like, have

336
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:17,165
some arguments with them.
I don't really think we need to

337
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,032
go to therapy, to be honest, to
solve our problems.

338
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:22,466
I think we should just talk.
KHLOE: You're the one who I

339
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:25,032
think has the communication
issue.

340
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:27,100
KOURTNEY: Just me?

341
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,599
KHLOE: We always just, like,
sweep things under the rug, we

342
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,199
don't talk anything through.
That's just what this family

343
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,033
does.

344
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,632
In therapy, are you on your
phone?

345
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,099
Or do you give your therapist
attention?

346
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,366
KOURTNEY: Hmm.
KHLOE: If you were listening,

347
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,466
instead of zooming in on some
picture, you would've known what

348
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:57,099
I was saying.
So if you don't care to fix

349

that's... I can't force you to.

KOURTNEY: Um... hold on.

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,232
KHLOE: I'm trying to talk it
out with her, but instead of

352
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:12,599
actually talking it out, she's
editing a photo on her phone.

353

That's not all on her shoulders.

795
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,999

between her and I, like,

796
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,532
specifically.
And I would like to understand

797
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:25,300
what that is.

798
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,532

worries you.

799

800

803

on a trip, like, everything to

804
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:44,699

was trying to say to you on the

805

is... the show is more

806
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,399
important, work's more
important.

807
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,432
Maybe traveling isn't, like,
a priority to you, but it is

808
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:57,432
to me.
But I feel like you would never

809
00:35:57,433 --> 00:36:02,032
take the time to just go, like,
do something 'cause maybe you

810
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:03,999
don't want to leave work, maybe
you don't want to do this.

something.

KIM: I definitely think
Kourtney is going through

814
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:18,566
something, but she can't commit
to filming a season and sharing

815
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:22,032
her life if she's not going to
at all.

816
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:25,032
We, honestly, want Kourtney to
take her trips.

817
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:27,432
We want Kourtney to live her
life and do whatever she wants

818
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:30,566
to do.
But we just want her to be held

819
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:33,699
accountable and be responsible
that when you take a job and

820
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,466
you're getting paid to do
something, that you honor that.

821
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:40,699
'Cause all of us do.
ANITA: Do you guys respect

KOURTNEY: I think I do.

00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,332

lives in Cleveland half the

she wants to be.

825
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:52,065
And, I mean, whatever Kim has to
do, I think on the day of that

826
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:56,599
particular shoot, I agree that I
acted like I didn't care about

827
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,632
all of her stuff, 'cause I truly
didn't.

828
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,366
KIM: She didn't have any
other appointments.

829
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:02,065
She just wanted to take the day
easy.

830
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,466
KHLOE: I also think it's not
just this one day.

831
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:07,733
Kourtney, basically, for the
past, like, few months has been

832
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:10,499
consistently late to work, which
is, you know, there's always an

833
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,099
excuse... this or that.
But we've all been getting

834
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,733
irritated.
Then, when we're like, "What's"

835
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:15,599
wrong?"
She's like, "Oh, couldn't get it

836
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,733
together, deal with it."
Like, we were feeling very much

837
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:22,065
like if we could all be here on
time, please make yourself

838
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:24,332
avail... or when you are here,
be present.

839
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,466
She's been on her phone.
So we were feeling

840
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:30,632
frustrated with that aspect.
So that was a reoccurring,

841
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:33,766
daily, kind of nitpicking that
we would all do, or throw little

842
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:35,132

Kourtney, yeah, that got really

844
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,632
annoying to her.
But I think we thought if we

845
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,632
keep doing this, she'll be on
time.

846
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:46,766
KOURTNEY: I think it's like,
everyone understanding that we

847
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:52,366
all have different priorities
and, like, working is just...

848
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:55,532
It's not my top priority.
It's never going to be.

once a month.

850
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,999
KOURTNEY: But that was a new
relationship, and my boyfriend

851
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,532
was not living in the country.
So if I had to leave for one

852
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:08,999

what it was.
