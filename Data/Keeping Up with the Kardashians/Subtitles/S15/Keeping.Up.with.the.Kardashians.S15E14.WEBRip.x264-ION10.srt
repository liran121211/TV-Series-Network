methylisothiazolinone.
Kids started to get these rashes

137
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:29,999

ingredient out of the wipes.
KHADIJAH: So crazy.

139
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,099
NNEKA: Triphenyl phosphate,
that's a flame retardant.

140
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,499
It's in nail polish, and it
soaks right through your

141

cuticles and gets into your
body.

142
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,632

flame retardant we, like, would

00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:46,632
treat our couches or rugs with?
NNEKA: Yeah.

NNEKA: It just will. Yeah.
If you're pregnant, you should

146
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,999
avoid it.
JOCELYN: We did a test, and

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,499
babies are born pre-polluted
with over 300... 287 industrial

148

NNEKA: And also, when you

149
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:01,999
look at the European laws,
there's more than a thousand

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,132
ingredients banned or restricted
versus the 11 here.

151
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,532
That disparity is just too...
it's too striking.

152
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:11,999

it's up to us to really do the

research and figure it out, you
know.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,499
NNEKA: The law hasn't been
updated since 1938, so we're

155

working really, really hard to
update the personal care law and

156
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:23,666
get a bill passed that would
ensure that products are safe

157
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:27,099
before they go on store shelves,
and we'd love your help to get

KOURTNEY: Thank you.

633

It's a pretty big day.
I'm going to speak to Congress

KOURTNEY: I'm sorry we're

639
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,199

I don't know what happened.

ADRIENNE: You look amazing.
No, the traffic can be insane.

641

Good morning. Hi.
WOMAN: Good morning.

642

Nice to see you.
KOURTNEY: Nice to see you.

good dinner.

JOCELYN: Yes. Yeah.

648

Um, Scott and Pen started it

649
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:09,766
We have it set up as a
conversational style, and

650
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,733

walking into a full room.

651
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:14,999
KOURTNEY: Okay.
JOCELYN: There's, like, an

We're gonna go to the right.

GUARD: Step through.

KOURTNEY: I didn't really
realize this was, like, a

655
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:28,733

So I hope that I don't let my

656
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:31,766
nerves get the best of me.
FABER: So, maybe just to

657
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,232
start, maybe talk a little bit
about when you first became

658
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:37,366

cosmetics.

just haven't seen her.

662
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,632
KIM: I just feel like
Tristan's here, and she's so

663
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:51,632
nervous for him and I to see
each other.

664
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:55,499
I don't want to have any more
distance between me and Khloe,

665
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,766
so I'm going to extend an olive
branch.

666
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:02,032
Where's Tristan?
Should I go say hi to my bestie?

667
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:10,033
KHLOE: I don't want just to
have fighting in the house.

668
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,632
FABER: So, maybe just to
start, maybe you could talk a

669
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:19,632
little bit about when you first
became concerned about the

670
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:23,232
chemicals in cosmetics.
KOURTNEY: Um, well...

671
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,232
(clears throat)
When I had my first son, I

672
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:30,666
started learning a lot about the
foods that, you know, I was

673
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:34,366
giving him, and then it
snowballed into learning a lot

674
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:38,432
about products, and... you know,
I would find out that they had a

675
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:41,332
lot of harmful chemicals.
To me, it was just really

676
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:45,265
shocking that you can buy baby
products and products for

677
00:32:45,266 --> 00:32:51,165
children that are not safe.
It shouldn't be up to parents or

678
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:54,165
consumers, really, to have to do
that much research.

679
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,165
FABER: Right.
KOURTNEY: You know, it's time

680
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,999
that Congress does its job.
(laughter, applause)

681
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,032
FABER: There you go.
KOURTNEY: I never really

682
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,532
thought that I would be here
speaking in front of Congress

683
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,532
and Senate. BALDWIN: We're still

684
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:07,532
plugging away on this issue,
and thank you for your advocacy.

685
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:09,265
KOURTNEY: Yes.
BALDWIN: Really appreciate

686
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:11,265
it. KOURTNEY: We're so happy to

687
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:13,132
be here.
I feel like I'm getting my

688
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:16,265
points across well and people
are really understanding why

689
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:18,466
it's so important.
PALLONE: Yeah, you know,

690
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,566
I have two daughters,
and as they were growing up,

691
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,199
they always assumed that if they
were buying something, somebody

692
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,466
had looked at it and said it was
safe.

693
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:29,032
And when I told them that that's
not true, they were like, "How"

694
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:31,032
"can that be?" >> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

695
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:34,165
I was nervous, but I'm just
happy that I could be here to

time with my sisters.

790
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:46,265
So I'm gonna extend an olive
branch, 'cause, I mean, that's

791
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:48,066
really all I can do.

792
00:38:50,266 --> 00:38:53,165
Where's Tristan?
KHLOE: In the theater.

793
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:57,566
KIM: Should I go say hi to
my bestie?

794
00:38:57,567 --> 00:39:01,432
KHLOE: Can I go with you?
KIM: No, I can handle it.

795
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:06,199
KHLOE: Oh, my God.
Kim going into the theater to

796
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,699
see Tristan, obviously, like, my
heart is racing.

797
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,232
I have a ton of anxiety.
I don't want just to have

798
00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:20,165
fighting in the house.
KIM: Where's my bestie?

799
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:23,733
KIM: Where's my bestie?
KHLOE: Uh-oh.

800
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:26,332
Give me your audio thing.
I need to hear what's happening.

801
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,466
Oh, my God. >> KIM: Hi.

802
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:32,599
TRISTAN: What's going on?
KIM: Um...

803
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,632
Have you ever played pickleball?
KHLOE: She's like, "Have you"

804
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:41,232
ever played pickleball?"
KIM: It's like a mix between

805
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:43,133
tennis and Ping-Pong.

806
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:46,366
KOURTNEY: Are you on a phone
call?

807
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,366
KHLOE: What phone would I be on?

808
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:50,366
KIM: So, it's a smaller
court, like a tennis court, but,

809
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,332
like, tiny.
TRISTAN: So, there's no

810
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,332
pickles? >> KIM (laughing): No.

811
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:56,499
TRISTAN: Oh, okay, okay.
KIM: No pickles.

812
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,466
I have no idea how to even start
a conversation with Tristan.

813
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:03,232
Pickleball is the first thing
that popped into my head.

814
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,599
It was super awkward, but he's
an athlete.

815
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,632
I just thought maybe talking
about sports would be common

816
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:11,366
ground. I'm such a good athlete.

817
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,366
Have you ever seen me ski?
TRISTAN: You can ski?

818
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:15,632
KIM: What?
Have you ever seen my video,

819
00:40:15,633 --> 00:40:18,499
or was I blocked at that point?
TRISTAN: No, no, uh, no, I

820
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,132
didn't see it. KIM: Okay, look.

821
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:23,366
KHLOE: She's showing him the
videos, um...

822
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:25,366
KOURTNEY: From skiing?
KHLOE: From skiing to prove

823
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:27,766
what a good athlete she is.
TRISTAN: Holy (bleep).

824
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:29,632
KIM: So I'm a good athlete.
TRISTAN: You're legit.

825
00:40:29,633 --> 00:40:31,132
KIM: No, no, no.
TRISTAN: You do winter

826
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:32,699
sports. KIM: I'm legitimately a

827
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,399
really, really, really good
athlete.

828
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,265
TRISTAN: So you're coming for
Lindsey Vonn's spot?

829
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:38,299
KIM: No.
TRISTAN: You know who that

830
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,232
is? >> KIM: Yes, of course.

831
00:40:40,233 --> 00:40:42,265
She dated Tiger Woods.
TRISTAN: Yeah, she did.

832
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:44,366
KIM: And she's a professional
skier.

833
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:47,399
I'm really, really good.
KHLOE: I like that they're

834
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,666
having a moment, so I won't
intrude.

835
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,632
KIM: I bet you I can beat you
in some kind of sport, though.

836
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:53,632
What do you...?
TRISTAN: Only winter sports.

837
00:40:53,633 --> 00:40:55,632
KIM: It's on. Challenge.
TRISTAN: May the best of us

838
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,666
win. Yeah. >> KIM: Challenge.

839
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:59,566
TRISTAN: Calabasas versus
Hidden Hills. Yeah.

840
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:03,265
KIM: Yes. Yes, that's a good
one.

841
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:06,299
I just challenged Tristan to a
game of pickleball.

842
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,265
I realized that, why am I
fighting this fight if no one

843
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,699
else is?
I'm not gonna spend my time

844
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,032
angry at someone else for
something that they didn't do to

845
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:19,999
me. I'm gonna move on, if that's

846
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,399
what Khloe chooses to do.
I'm gonna be supportive of her.

847
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,399
TRISTAN: First of all, I
thought you were gonna play

848
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,399
this.
KHLOE: I am, 'cause I can't

849
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,399
do pickleball? Can you?
You don't even know what that

850
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,399
is.
I just heard of it yesterday.

851
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,265
TRISTAN: Actually, I did.
I did know, I know how it is

852
00:41:32,266 --> 00:41:34,299
now. Yeah.
The combination of Ping-Pong

853
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,532
and, uh, tennis.
KHLOE: Oh, true.

854
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:37,265
KOURTNEY: It has a lot of rules.

855
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:39,299
KHLOE: No, there's a lot of
rules.

856
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,032
You have to stay out of the
kitchen and do some...

857
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,733
TRISTAN: I just thought that
Kim had the least athletic gene

858
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,699
out of all three of you guys.
KHLOE: This one does.

859
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,599
KIM: Kourtney does for sure.
TRISTAN: She works out every

860
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,566
day. KOURTNEY: How good am I in

861
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:50,466
the gym? TRISTAN: You're good.

862
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,332
You've gotten much better.
Your lather's becoming a sweat

863
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:55,332
now. >> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

864
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:57,566
KIM: Do you think I should
ask this guy to unblock me?

865
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,699
TRISTAN: Dismissed.
KIM: There's no going back.

866
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,699
TRISTAN: There's no going
back now.

867
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,500
You're here now.

868
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,065
(birds singing)
KHLOE: Oh, and this is what

869
00:42:10,066 --> 00:42:12,699
we're getting True.
LARSA: Are you cool with him

870
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,065
now? KIM: Yeah. It's all good.

871
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,699
My relationship with Tristan...
It's a work in progress, but it

872
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,232
is just really important to move
forward.

873
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:25,499
We're such a close family.
We're one big family.

874
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,733
You just have to just move on
and get over it.

875
00:42:28,734 --> 00:42:32,065
TRISTAN: (bleep)
KHLOE: Don't hurt yourself.

876
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:34,099
KOURTNEY: Oh, my God.
Did you hit the tree?

877
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,232
TRISTAN: No, no, I almost...
I didn't know it was that

878
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:37,332
bouncy.
KHLOE: Do you know how to do

879
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,099
this? TRISTAN: I'll go with no

880
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,366
socks. LARSA: Tristan, I'm glad

881
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:43,332
you're living your best life!
KHLOE: Have you ever been on

882
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:46,332
a trampoline?
TRISTAN: Uh... maybe.

883
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,332
KOURTNEY: This is, like, a
real deal trampoline.

884
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,599
KHLOE: We're gonna get that
for True.

885
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,599
No, don't do that.
KOURTNEY: Were you gonna try

886
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,733
to flip? >> TRISTAN: Yeah.

887
00:42:54,734 --> 00:42:56,733
I don't know if I...
KHLOE: Can you flip in real

888
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:58,733
life? >> TRISTAN: I can do a

889
00:42:58,734 --> 00:43:00,599
cartwheel. KHLOE: No, you can't.

890
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,532
TRISTAN: Back in 2005...
KHLOE: Kourtney can.

891
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:04,999
Show him your cartwheel skills.
Look at this.

892
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,099
(laughing): Oh, yeah.
You know I can't do it.

893
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:13,766
LARSA: This is the life.
(children squealing)

894
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:16,999
NORTH: One, two...
KIM: Being here, swimming,

895
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,432
hanging out with my kids, with
my family... this is the dream.

896
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:23,366
This is what I love to do.
I mean, even having Tristan

897
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,366
here... it's just...
We're all together.

898
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:29,366
It's so much fun, and this is
what life's all about.

899
00:43:29,367 --> 00:43:32,099
KOURTNEY: We're gonna...
we're gonna race.

900
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,366
KIM: One. >> KOURTNEY: One.

901
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:40,566
ALL: Two. Three.
(indistinct chatter)

902
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:45,132
KOURTNEY: My top fell off!
KIM: On the next episode...

903
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:47,399
KRIS: I just got a call from
Shelli.

904
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,666
She wants to put together this
huge poker tournament.

905
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,666
MAN: Ready to learn some poker?

906
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:53,666
KIM: Don't underestimate...
No, underestimate me.

907
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:55,666
I prefer it. I'm all in.

908
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:58,466
(Kris whoops)
So, I think I'm gonna go to.

909
00:43:58,467 --> 00:44:00,999
Paris and go to the Louis
Vuitton show.

910
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,132
KHLOE: How do you feel now?
KIM: I'm going really

911
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:06,132
cautiously, but you never know
what could happen.

912
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:08,132
