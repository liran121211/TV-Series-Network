00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:21,165
time definitely helps me
mentally.

160
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:26,699
But I guess you never know what
could happen.

161
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,566
HUANG: As you know, we've
been doing ultrasounds to kind

162
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,599
of make sure that we have plenty
of eggs to harvest.

163
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,599
KOURTNEY: I'm coming to the
doctor to start the process of

164
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,466
freezing my eggs.
HUANG: See the dark circle

165
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,065
here? >> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

166
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,733
HUANG: Okay, so here's one
follicle.

167
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:42,199
KOURTNEY: Only one?
Maybe it's just not the best

168
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,065
time.
KIM: I hope that I can start

169
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:51,032
to remember all the magical
things about Paris and why Kanye

170
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:55,466
and I fell in love with it here.
There's so many people, so much

171
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,733
paparazzi. (Paparazzi clamoring)

172
00:08:57,734 --> 00:09:05,734
I'm just, like, hypersensitive
to this right now.

173
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,599
HUANG: Hey, how are you?
KOURTNEY: How are you?

174
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,599
HUANG: Hi. Good to see you.
KOURTNEY: Good to see you.

175
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,733
HUANG: How have you been?
KOURTNEY: I have almost

176
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:20,733
started the process of freezing
my eggs a few times, and the

177
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:25,199
timing is finally... feels right
with my schedule, and so I'm

178
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,332
coming to the doctor to get a
checkup to make sure that

179
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,599
everything looks good to start
the process.

180
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,599
HUANG: As you know, we've
been doing ultrasounds to kind

181
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,332
of make sure that we have plenty
of eggs to... to harvest.

182
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,232
And so some months you'll have
more, some months you'll have

183
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,065
less.
We want to get a month where you

184
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:40,632
have more. Okay? KOURTNEY: Okay.

185
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,632
HUANG: 'Cause if we do this,
I want to make it worthwhile.

186
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,132
So we want to get... I would say
for you, knowing kind of what we

187
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,132
know about you, five to ten.
KOURTNEY: Okay.

188
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,099
HUANG: Okay? 'Cause if we
can get five to ten, even as you

189
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,366
get older, these will stay
younger.

190
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:52,265
Okay? So we'll take a quick look
right now.

191
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,999
KOURTNEY: Okay.
HUANG: All right?

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,366
So, you're gonna feel a light
touch, okay?

193
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:57,366
Sorry about that.
A little bit of pressure.

194
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,632
That's it.
So, we're gonna look at the

195
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,766
right side first, okay,
Kourtney?

196
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,332
See the dark circle here?
KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

197
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,399
HUANG: Okay, so, here's one
follicle.

198
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,999
All right, so on this side, just
that one, okay?

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,399
KOURTNEY: Only one?
HUANG: On the right side.

200
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,232
So, here's where more follicles
are.

201
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,766
See this right here?
KOURTNEY: Uh-huh.

202
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,366
HUANG: That's your left ovary.

203
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:17,366
So, on this side you have about
four.

204
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,366
KOURTNEY: When the doctor
tells me that I have five

205
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,399
follicles, I'm kind of shocked.
Why am I even doing this when I

206
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,999
have five?
Should I come back another month

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,699
when I might have more?
Like, maybe it's just not

208
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,265
the best time.
HUANG: In two years, five is

209
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:32,265
gonna be down to three or four.
KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

210
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,399
HUANG: And then a few years
later, it's gonna be down to one

211
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,265
or two.
You decide, uh, and I'll help

I'm not allowed to.

00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:52,766
I'll show you why in a second.
KIM: I've heard that in poker

242
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:56,065
you're not necessarily playing
your cards, you're just playing

243
00:11:56,066 --> 00:12:00,332
the other people.
So for me, I decided to meet

244
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,099
with a mentalist.
KRIS: A mentalist is gonna

245

influence people or read people.

250
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:19,065
So, forget about the game,
forget about the rules because

251
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,466
they're gonna teach you the
rules.

252
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,466

LIOR: In poker it's all about

253
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,466
understanding how the people in
front of you think...

254
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:26,999
KIM: Mm-hmm.
LIOR: And understand if

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,999
they have good hands or bad
hands.

256
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,399
PHIL: You're only gonna play,
like, my top ten hands.

257
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,399
That's pocket aces, pocket
kings, all the way down to

258
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,532
sevens... >> KHLOE: Okay.

259
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:37,999
PHIL: And then ace-king
and ace-queen.

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,232
And fold everything else.
That's extreme, but if you play

261
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:43,232
just those ten hands...
KHLOE: Okay.

262
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:46,366

have a great chance of winning.

Phil's method of teaching,

00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:01,999
That was not the vibe. Sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

791
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,065
NURSE: That's normal.
You're gonna do great.

792
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:06,065
KOURTNEY: Okay.
LARSA: I feel like it's so

793
00:41:06,066 --> 00:41:07,666
fast, right?
NURSE: It's so fast, and

794
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,432
it's, like, the best nap you've
ever had.

795
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,566
It's just like, "Oh, that's good
sleep, I don't want to wake up."

796
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:13,566
KOURTNEY: Yeah.
NURSE: Yeah. That's what most

797
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:15,666
of our patients say.
LARSA: Yeah, it's like a good

798
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:18,132
night's rest.
KOURTNEY: Yeah. I need it.

799
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:20,733
NURSE (laughs): Yeah.
We all do when it's this early.

800
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:23,132
LARSA: Yeah, totally.
NURSE: Ready to go, so I'm

801
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:25,132
gonna walk in with you.
If you, uh...

802
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:27,132
KOURTNEY: So, I get up?
NURSE: Step down on that

803
00:41:27,133 --> 00:41:28,699
side. All right, perfect.

804
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,699
And we'll have you go out to the
waiting room, and then we'll

805
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,466
take good care of her.
LARSA: Okay.

806
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:34,065
LARSA: All right, bye.
I love you.

807
00:41:34,066 --> 00:41:42,066
KOURTNEY: Bye. ♪ ♪

808
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:54,065
KIM: Who do we have here?
Kendall.

809
00:41:54,066 --> 00:42:02,066
Cutie. Oh. Oh, hey.

810
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,733
Guys, I'm gonna say this is a
really (bleep) proud moment in

811
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:09,733
my life.
In Macy's, giant-sized cutouts

812
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:13,199
of every family member.
KOURTNEY: What do you think

813
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,699
about this? (Laughs)
KIM: Wait, so, how was your,

814
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,599
um, how was your retrieval?
How many did you get out?

815
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,499
KOURTNEY: I got out seven.
KIM: That's a lot.

816
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,099
That's exactly how many I got
out.

817
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,733
KOURTNEY: It is? KIM: Yeah.

818
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:29,065
KOURTNEY: I got out eight,
but two they said weren't good,

819
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:32,199
and then they incubated them,
and they got one out of the two.

820
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,599
So I got seven.
KIM: Oh, that's amazing.

821
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,199
KOURTNEY: Yeah.
The procedure was much easier

822
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,733
than I thought, so I'm really
happy about that.

823
00:42:41,734 --> 00:42:44,466
I mean, I just feel good.
Like, life is good.

824
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:47,733
I have the insurance if I want
to have kids, or maybe I'll

825
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:50,766
never use them.
But I think it's just nice to

826
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:53,199
have.
It's something that, like, gives

827
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,666
me peace of mind and I don't
have to worry about, and I think

828
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,733
it was all worth it, and I'm
just happy that it's done.

829
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:02,766
KIM: Wait, was it easier than
you thought it was gonna be?

830
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:05,632
KOURTNEY: Way easier.
Way easier than I

831
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:07,232
thought. >> KIM: That's amazing.

832
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:09,232
KOURTNEY: So, I don't think I
need to do it again.

833
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:11,032
KIM: Definitely, you don't
need to do it again.

834
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:13,499
You don't need that many.
KOURTNEY: No. If anything...

835
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,699
KIM: 100%. You don't need
any more.

836
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,699
KOURTNEY: Yeah.
KIM: I'm really proud of.

837
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,499
Kourtney taking the real steps
to freeze her eggs.

838
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,132
But I think it's just, like, all
really symbolic.

839
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,132
Making good decisions and moving
forward and putting herself and

840
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:29,666
her own happiness first.
Let's take a pic by mine real

841
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,467
quick.

842
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,232
KIM: Like this? Is this my pose?

843
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:38,766
Oh, but I'm like this.
MAN: Got it.

844
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:45,065
KIM: Cool.
On the next episode...

845
00:43:45,066 --> 00:43:47,599
KANYE: What? Put 'em here.
I'm the one and only Kanye.

846
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,733
West. (Ringtone playing)

847
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:52,332
KIM: Hello? What?

848
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,999
Right now.

849
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,265
When he gets ramped up, he can't
control what he says.

850
00:43:57,266 --> 00:44:01,032
You know, Alice Johnson, the
only person that could get her

851
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:03,265
out of prison would be the
president.

852
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:06,265
We have one shot to plead our
case.

853
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:09,532
Alice, you're out.
