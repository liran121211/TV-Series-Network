479
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:00,666
KHLOE: Aw. >> SAINT: Daddy.

480
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,232
KHLOE: Are you and Kanye good?

481
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,232

like, not in, like, the best

482
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:05,632
mood. >> KHLOE: Oh, no.

483
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,766
KIM: I was just, like, tired.
I got home, and I was like,

484
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:10,099
"Hey," and then I was, like, on
my computer, and then he was

485
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,699
like, "Hey, um, babe, will you
get off your computer?"

486
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,032
Like, let's t... I want to talk,
like, let's hang out."

487
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:18,032
And I was like, "Okay, will you
give me ten minutes?"

488
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,999
I'm on a deadline."
I really was like, "I have to

489
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,065
get this done."
And then Saint's like, "Mommy,

490
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:24,132
Mommy, let's go take a bath,"
I go, "Okay."

491
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:26,199
And I shut the computer, and
he's like, "You're gonna go take"

492
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,165
a bath with him, and then... but
I asked to hang out and talk

493
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,065
and you wouldn't?"
And I was like, "Oh, my God,

494
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,699
I'm sorry."
KHLOE: Maybe just take a bath

495
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,666
with Kanye, and it will all be
better.

496
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,999
KIM: And then we had a fight
'cause I wouldn't get him a.

497
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,666
Band-Aid.
I said, "Did you look in the"

498
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:40,666
proper place?
There's a Band-Aid here."

499
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:43,165
He didn't like that one.
So he wanted another one.

500
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,999
A Band-Aid there,
and I put it on him.

501
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,032
He didn't like the color of the
Band-Aid.

502
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:49,532
And so we went upstairs in the
kids room, and I go, "Oh, look",

503
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:52,065
North has Jesus Band-Aids.
Put on a Jesus Band-Aid."

504
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,999
And then he was like, "I've
slaved around the world, making"

505
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,666
clothes for you to make sure
that you find the best outfit,

506
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,566
"and you let me go out wearing a
Jesus Band-Aid?"

507
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,099
KHLOE: Aw.
KIM: He said I should've got

508
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,099
a skin-colored Band-Aid.
And I'm like, "So I'm running"

509
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,566
around to find three (bleep)
different color Band-Aids?

510
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:10,699
"When I have three kids to look
after."

511
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,699
When you have three kids, it's
kind of a wild household, so I'm

512
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,699
kind of annoyed, 'cause I wish
he would understand also, like,

513
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,699
I'm exhausted.
Like, "Go get your own."

514
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,099
Band-Aid."
Just because I didn't give birth

515
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,766
to this baby doesn't mean that
my plate is not totally full.

516
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:28,599
So I said, "Call the
housekeeper."

517
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,099
Let's have her get a Band-Aid."
He's like, "Well, why can't you

518
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,566
get it?
You would get Saint one."

519
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:35,199
And I'm like, "Oh, my God, are
you fighting with Saint?"

520
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,766
Is this... are you... is this,
like, a thing?"

521
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:40,065
I was like, "This is not gonna
be this way."

522
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:42,332
And I'm not gonna have a
full-fledged fight 'cause I

523
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,065
"won't get you a Band-Aid.
I'm sorry."

524

make him feel better, just to

KIM: I can't.

526

That's where I draw the line.
KHLOE: But if that's gonna

527

make him feel more loved, don't
you want to just get the.

528
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:57,733
Band-Aid?
Sometimes, like, men still want

overwhelmed, and I think

sometimes that's easy to maybe
get distracted or, 'cause you

532
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,733

can take care of themselves, but

792
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:12,599
'Cause from what I heard from
Kimberly is that you wanted a

boring Kourtney was.

SCOTT: And that if she was

doing anything right, she would
just have another kid with you.

797
00:39:23,066 --> 00:39:25,699
You know how it is.
I mean, when somebody in the

something, you just got to kind

I think he'll think it's really
cute.

Tough strips. No, more.
I actually think this is enough.

Kanye's so thoughtful and even
when he's really, like, in crazy

work mode, he always takes the
time to check in on me to see

823
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,032
what's going on.
And I think when I get in super

824
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:57,132
busy mode, I need to really
just, like, slow down and be a

825
00:40:57,133 --> 00:41:01,599
little bit more thoughtful.
I think I've definitely gotten

It's called Excitement,

KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.
KIM: And, like, it's $1.99.

832
00:41:16,133 --> 00:41:19,065
Oh, my God, you're gonna think
I'm, like, joking, but I love

833
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:23,165
these shoes.
KOURTNEY: Do you want a nurse

834
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:26,065

You should get a nurse since he

835
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,599
said you don't take care of him.
KIM: (laughs)

would be really cute to just go
