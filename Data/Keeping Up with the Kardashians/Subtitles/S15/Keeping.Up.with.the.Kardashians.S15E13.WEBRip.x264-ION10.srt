As much as I want to go off, I
just don't think it's the time,

I don't have to have a lot of

00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:32,766
KHLOE: Oh, my goodness.
KOURTNEY: She's smiling.

317
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,599
KHLOE: I have a baby.
It's really crazy.

318
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,999
ANDREA: Yes, my princess.
We've been waiting for you, and

319
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,199
you're finally here. Thank God.

320
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,599
TRISTAN: Good morning.
ANDREA: The new dad.

321
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,599
KOURTNEY: Mom, look how cute
this photo is.

322
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,399
I said, "Someone post it."
KRIS: Aw.

323
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Can you send that to me?
It makes me cry.

324
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,766
I couldn't go get a card.
That's for you.

325
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:08,399
KHLOE: Oh, my God, you saved
this?

326
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,399
KRIS: Mm-hmm.
KHLOE: My dad really gave

327
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,366
this to me? >> KRIS: Mm-hmm.

328
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:18,366
KHLOE: Oh, my God, what's...
Don't cry.

329
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:20,366
KRIS: I waited a long time to
do this.

330
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,366
ANDREA: Yeah, it's a blessing.

331
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:28,632
KHLOE: Oh, my God. Mom.

332
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:33,366
Oh, my God.
Oh, Mom, you've kept this for

333
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,366
that long? >> KRIS: Uh-huh.

334
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,666
TRISTAN: I'll get you, um...
KRIS: It was the present that

335
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,032
your dad gave me the day you
were born.

336
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:44,065
KHLOE: Mom, you're so cute.
KRIS: Yeah.

337
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:47,432
KHLOE: My mom is just so
thoughtful, and she thinks so

338
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:51,999
far ahead.
And I cannot put into words how

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,532
sweet it is of my mom, saving
these three bracelets that my

340
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,999
dad gave her as her push
present.

341
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,733
She saved them for 34 years.
And I'm really grateful for

342
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,733
that. TRISTAN: Now we'll save it

343
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:05,699
and give it to her when she has
her daughter.

344
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,733
KHLOE: That's exactly what
we're gonna do.

345
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:10,065
KRIS: I'm so proud of you.
TRISTAN: Wait for her.

346
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,399
KHLOE: Thank you. ALIABADI: Hey.

347
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,532
Let's go to Mama.
KHLOE: Hi, baby.

348
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,032
KOURTNEY: Khlo, do we have a
name for her?

349
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:19,532
KHLOE: I think True.
It's the only name that I think

350
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,532
about. >> KOURTNEY: T-R-U?

351
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,532
KHLOE: "E." KOURTNEY: T-R-U-E.

352
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,566
MALIKA: I think that's
beautiful.

353
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,065
KOURTNEY: It is.
KHLOE: Her name is True.

354
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,699
Thompson.
I knew I wanted the initials.

355
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,699
T.T., 'cause I love that my
initials are K.K.

356
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,566
And I was at dinner one night at
my mom's house and MJ was there

357
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:39,032
and I told her that.
Tristan and I want to do either

358
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:41,032
a name that starts with a "T" or
a "K."

359
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:43,032
MJ: How 'bout Tommy?
We could call her Tommy.

360
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:45,032
KOURTNEY: Tommy Thompson?
MJ: How about True?

361
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:47,032
KOURTNEY: I love the name True.

362
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:49,065
MJ: That's your grandfather's
name.

363
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:51,366
He was a good man. KHLOE: True.

364
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:54,065
MJ: I love that.
KHLOE: We kept going back and

365
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:57,332
forth, and True was the only one
that really always made the cut.

366
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,299
And then everyone says you have
to wait till you meet the baby.

367
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,566
But I don't know who looks like
a True.

368
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,566
I don't know if, like, when Kim
was naming North, if they were

369
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,599
like, "Oh, she looks like a
North."

370
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,599
Like, what the (bleep) is a
North?

371
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,766
What the (bleep) is a True?
They just become these names,

372
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,132
and they're so cute.
KOURTNEY: Is she gonna have a

373
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,599
middle name?
KHLOE: I don't think so.

374
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,733
MALIKA: She could be a True
Kardashian.

375
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:21,199
KOURTNEY: True Kardashian.
What if her name was True.

376
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,466
Kardashian Thompson?
KRIS: I kind of like it.

377
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,766
MALIKA: I'm not mad at it at
all.

378
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,766
(True burps)
KHLOE: Oh! There you go,

379
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,766
young lady. (Laughter)

380
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:33,099
KOURTNEY: She makes the
cutest noises.

381
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,366
MALIKA: Yeah, she coos.
KHLOE: Okay.

382
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,366
KOURTNEY: Tristan, I was
FaceTiming Reign.

383
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,733
TRISTAN: Yeah.
KOURTNEY: He was like, "Aw!"

384
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:43,733
And then he goes, "I love her.
KoKo, she can share all my toys."

385
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,733
"My Legos..." >> TRISTAN: Really?

386
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:48,099
KOURTNEY: "my..." Yeah.
TRISTAN: Aw, that's so nice.

387
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,532
KIM: That's cute.
KHLOE: You know, I was super

388
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:54,999
anxious about having everybody
in the hospital room, because it

389
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,399
was really crucial and important
for me that it was a very

390
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,232
healthy, happy, positive
experience.

391
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:05,232
And it was... Everyone put their
differences aside for that

392
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:07,499
moment.
I'm really grateful for that.

393
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,566
TRISTAN: I'm proud of you.
KHLOE: But, I mean,

394
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,232
obviously, there's a big
elephant in the room.

395
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:15,766
I think it's important for you
two... you and Kourt and him

396
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:17,766
have a talk.
KIM: Well, me, Kourtney,

397
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,766
Kendall and Kylie are coming
back Monday.

398
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:21,766
We're leaving Tuesday night.
KHLOE: So Monday will be

399
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,766
fine. We'll make time Monday.

400
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,499
TRISTAN: Mm-hmm.
KHLOE: Tristan said to me

401
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,165
that he wants to talk with my
sisters and my mom.

402
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,165
Um, I have my own personal
feelings, 'cause this happened

403
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,466
to me.
But my sisters also have their

404
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:38,699
feelings, and they are very much
entitled to that.

405
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,666
KIM: You ready? TRISTAN: Huh?

406
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,999
KIM: You ready? TRISTAN: Always.

407
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,132
KHLOE: When there's drama,
people love to be like, "Well",

408
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:48,032
this is my relationship.
I don't need to involve people."

409
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:51,132
Well, in this family, you do,
so...

410
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,132
TRISTAN: See you all later.
Safe travels.

411
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:55,165
I'll see you all in a little
bit.

412
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:59,599
KIM: Yeah, hey, bye.
See you later. Have a good game.

413
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,999
Don't slip.
KOURTNEY: All right, I feel

414
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,999
like we should go. KHLOE: Yeah.

415
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,265
FRIEND: Are you still okay
with us, like, coming out here

416
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:14,099
on Monday?
KHLOE: Why don't we talk, um,

417
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,099
just a little closer?
FRIEND: Okay.

418
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,165
KHLOE: 'Cause things are just
being weird these days.

419
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,165
So we'll just talk and see.
KOURTNEY: Are you happy we're

420
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,165
coming back or do you think
you're gonna be overwhelmed?

421
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,165
KHLOE: No, I'm happy.
I-I feel bad.

422
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,165
KOURTNEY: I feel like also
it's good you get to go home,

423
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,165
get settled. (True crying)

424
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,165
KHLOE: Yeah.
KOURTNEY: And then we'll come

425
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,466
back.
KHLOE: I just have to get out

426
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:35,566
of here.
KOURTNEY: Is somebody writing

427
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,733
you? >> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.

428
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:41,165
Too many people.
But writing about both things.

429
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,199
I'm like, "Shut up."
KOURTNEY: Yeah.

430
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,566
KHLOE: I don't have the
energy for that right now.

431
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,400
Like, everyone leave me alone.

432
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:52,566
KOURTNEY: I feel like
everyone just wants you to know

433
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:55,733
that you're supported.
KHLOE: And I appreciate that.

434
00:22:55,734 --> 00:23:00,599
I do. But...
it's also everyone has their own

435
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,766
(bleep) that I know nothing
about, and mine is thrown on the

436
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:07,065
public of everything.
And it's just... it's a lot

437
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:10,332
harder to filter through stuff
when it's this public and when I

438
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:15,733
gave birth the following day.
There's too much.

439
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:19,599
It's so much harder to deal with
it when it's so public and

440
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,632
everyone is giving you their
opinions and their input and

441
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:28,232
their unsolicited advice.
Even feeling like, "Oh, God, the"

442
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:31,466
nurses and the doctors"...
Everyone kind of, like, looking

443
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:34,099
sideways at the whole situation.
That's hard, and it's

444
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,632
humiliating.
KOURTNEY: I feel like people,

445
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:38,666
like, force you to try to, like,
get out of it.

446
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,566
KHLOE: Yeah. I just need to
figure out my own... without

447
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:45,232
feeling, like, guilty if I'm,
you know, letting you guys down

448
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,265
or this.
Or it's like I can't even worry

449
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:51,766
about that.
He obviously (bleep) up, major.

450
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:55,165
But I'm not sure how I feel
about anything right now.

451
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,265
In two weeks, I might say, "You
know what, I don't trust you",

452
00:23:57,266 --> 00:23:59,265
and this isn't for me."
Or I might say, "This is

453
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:01,265
perfect. Let's keep it going."

454
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,265
But I'm just, like... I'm
thinking way too much about

455
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,265
this. This is too (bleep) shady.

456
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:07,265
KIM: I feel like the worst is
over.

457
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:09,766
KHLOE: I don't know.
I feel so exhausted.

458
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:13,499
KIM: And we'll be back Monday
for our big family talk with.

459
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,699
Tristan. (True cries)

460
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,699
Khloe is literally acting like
nothing happened.

461
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,699
Maybe that's her way to cope.
KOURTNEY: No, that's what I

462
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,599
said.
I just said, "You're being too"

463
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,265
"nice." >> CICI: What happened in.

464
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:35,299
Cleveland?
KIM: We went back to have

465
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,699
this, like, family talk with
Tristan.

466
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,199
No cameras were there, and we
really wanted it to be a private

467
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,999
talk.
I told him, "I think you're more"

468
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,299
remorseful 'cause it's affecting
your job."

469
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:54,300
KRIS: I know she really never
saw it coming.

470
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,767
♪ ♪

471
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,332
KIM: So, for my reunion, do I
want to, like, dress up?

472
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:09,165

KOURTNEY: Yeah.

473
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,165
KIM: Like, what about, like,
something like that?

474
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,733
Where I can still have my
stomach out.

475
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:15,733
KOURTNEY: I think that's very
Kim K.

476
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:18,766
KIM: What about that?
Don't want people staring at my

477
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,199
ass. KOURTNEY: They're going to,

478
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,165
and, like, let them.
You should stand in a line and

479
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:27,199
say, "Does anyone want to touch
my ass?"

480
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,332
KIM: Since Khloe had her baby
early, despite all of the chaos,

481
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,165
one silver lining is just that
I'm gonna be able to go to my

482
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,299
reunion tomorrow.
I mean, it's been 20 years.

483
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,132
That's a really long time.
I want to see the faces of

484
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:44,632
people that I, you know, went to
high school with and see how

485
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:46,766
everyone turned out and what
they're up to.

486
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:52,632
So I'm really excited to go.
What are we gonna say on Monday?

487
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:55,232
KOURTNEY: Oh, when we go
back, you want to say something?

488
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:57,399
KIM: Yeah, he wants to have a
talk with us.

489
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,332
KOURTNEY: Oh, who said?
KIM: Tristan did.

490
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,366
KOURTNEY: He said it to you?
KIM: He said, "I would love"

491
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:06,332
to talk to you and Kourtney.
I think we all need to sit down

492
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:10,199
and talk."
And I said, "Oh, I'm ready."

493
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,733
Then I was like...
I was like, "This will be like."

494
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:18,399
Mayweather and Pacquiao, and I
am Mayweather.

495
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,165
So are you ready?"
KOURTNEY: But you're making

496
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:23,766
it into a joke?
KIM: No, I think it'll be

497
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:28,699
really serious.
I mean, it was definitely

498
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,999
awkward to see him, don't you
think?

499
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,766
KOURTNEY: I think he was
being the best he could.

500
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,766
KIM: And Khloe was literally
acting like nothing happened.

501
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,766
Maybe that's her way to cope.
KOURTNEY: Well, no, that's

502
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,299
what I said.
I just said, "I don't want him"

503
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,666
to think that you're being too
nice.

504
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,399
Like, did you have a
conversation with him that you

505
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,099
just can't wrap your head around
it right now and you need to,

506
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,999
"like, have your moment and
enjoy this... this moment?"

507
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,099
And she was like, "Yeah, he
knows."

508
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,366
But I also don't want it to be
where it just goes away then

509
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:03,666

I don't know, it just kind of

711
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:26,466
took a left turn.
Then he got mad because my mom

721
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,632

wear it, so I do.

787
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,032
PENELOPE: I want to wear it.
KIM: You want to wear it?

788
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:47,199
But I want to wear it.
Okay, fine, here you go.

789
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,032
Spider check.
KOURTNEY: Okay, you can take

790
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:54,165
off your shoes.
KIM: Can you believe.

791
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:57,032
Tristan's mad at me?
Khloe just wrote me and said...

792
00:41:57,033 --> 00:42:00,032
I sent her my... a clip of my
interview with Ellen.

793
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:02,099
KOURTNEY: Yeah.
KIM: I-I called her right

794
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,599
after and said I just want you
to know I said it's like effed

795
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,199
up. And so she texted me that he

796
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,099
said I'm trying to start
stuff, and I'm an instigator,

797
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,165
and blah, blah, blah.
(Penelope squeals)

798
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:16,065
KIM: So I unfollowed him on
Instagram and I'm like, he

799
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,733
should be embarrassed.
So I literally wrote her and

800
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:21,265
said, "Look, let's change the
subject."

801
00:42:21,266 --> 00:42:24,499
I love you and I support you."
But I'm, like, done.

802
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,099
Done with him. Over it.

803
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,065
PENELOPE: Done.
KOURTNEY: I feel like there's

804
00:42:31,066 --> 00:42:34,065
only so much we can do as much
as we... it's like, everyone has

805
00:42:34,066 --> 00:42:36,065
to learn their own lesson.
(Penelope screams)

806
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:38,099
KIM: She just should have
stood her ground.

807
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,632
You know what I mean, like, you
can't just, like, right away.

808
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:43,065
KOURTNEY: No. No.
You just... She should just do

809
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:47,332
what's in her heart.
And she should either... like,

810
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:50,099
give it a chance, and if that's
what makes her feel best for her

811
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,632
family, I've been there.
KIM: Like, that's not

812
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:54,766
realistic.
KOURTNEY: Yeah, I don't think

813
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:57,199
his intentions are right.
I don't think he's gonna change,

814
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,099
but I'm just saying, if she
wants to feel like she's trying

815
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,666
for her own heart, and know that
she's doing her best, then I

816
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:07,766
don't think there's anything
wrong with that.

817
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:11,366
I think it takes a lot more
strength to do... to hang in

818
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:17,766
there and try for your family
than to just walk away.

819
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:21,666
(Penelope speaking indistinctly)
KIM: I won't make her feel

820
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:26,366
bad about anything, but I just,
generally, don't care to, like,

821
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:30,999
be around him.
KOURTNEY: I mean, it's her

822
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,165
decision, and I don't think we
want to cause her any more

823
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:36,999
stress. KIM: I mean, ultimately,

824
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,666
whatever makes her happy.
I'll stay out of the way.

825
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:44,199
On the next episode...
Just to, like, a night off

826
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,399
to happen. >> ALL: To Cher.

827
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,666
KIM: I was able to pull off a
backstage meeting with Cher.

828
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:52,699
I feel like I'm gonna faint.
MAN: Okay, are you guys

829
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,132
ready? >> KIM: Oh, my God.

830
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,132
She's like, "Oh, please, I don't
want you guys to fight."

831
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:59,399
I'm like, "I unfollowed him and
I'm just letting you know."

832
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,399
KOURTNEY: Does he follow us?
KIM: (gasps) He blocked me.

833
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,666
Tristan is just too petty for
me.

834
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:06,399
Where's my bestie?
