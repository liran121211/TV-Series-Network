This is the first time

somebody again, but there always

back of me that feels guilty

Kourtney, you know what I mean?

475
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,632
hang with, you know what I mean?
SCOTT: Yeah, yeah, she's

476
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,099
good. >> BENNY: Good that she...

477
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,766
SCOTT: She's a copilot.
(Benny laughs)

478
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,733
SCOTT (sighing): Oh, man.
BENNY: Could we get an Uber

479
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:52,699
from up here?
SCOTT: Uh... Oh! More manure!

480
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,632
BENNY: This is a (bleep) trail.

481
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:56,566
SCOTT: This is definitely a
(bleep) trail.

482

483
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,766
KOURTNEY: Is something wrong
with the Wi-Fi, Khlo?

484
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,566
KHLOE: Oh, Kourtney.
KOURTNEY: It just won't post

485
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:10,532
my snaps.
KHLOE: Okay, well, I don't

486
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:14,032
know what to tell you, babe.
KOURTNEY: Mm, well, your.

487
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:18,132
Wi-Fi sucks.
KHLOE: Oh, it's so nice

488
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:20,632
seeing you. No, really.
That's great.

489
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:23,199
I love when people just come to
someone's house and complain

490
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,165
the whole time. >> KRIS: Oh.

491
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,065
KOURTNEY: Hey, Mom. KRIS: Hi.

492
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:32,165
KHLOE: Esperanza's here.
KOURTNEY: Um, Kim is...

493
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,632
KHLOE: What?
KOURTNEY: Really, um, wild

494
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:37,599
on the-the scheduling for
tomorrow.

495
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,099
KHLOE: Why, what's happening?

496
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,065
KOURTNEY: They had me
glamming at, like, 5:00 p.m. or

497
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:43,632
something and our shoot shooting
until 8:00.

498
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:48,666
I was like, I really want to get
home, relax, have dinner with my

499
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,599
kids, give them a bath...
KHLOE: Kim's been working so

500
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,566
hard on this, though.
KOURTNEY: Okay, but let's

501
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:57,032
move it up, what's the point?
KHLOE: So, get her out of the

502
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,666
glam room and let's ask her
these questions.

503
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,165
KOURTNEY: Kim! KHLOE: Kourt.

504
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,632
KOURTNEY: Hmm?
KHLOE: Get off your ass and

505
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,332
go get her. >> KOURTNEY: I will.

506
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:06,999
My (bleep) Snapchats keep
failing.

507
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,032
It's putting a lot of my
energy... it's draining.

508
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:17,265
Hi. We're all asking why can't
we glam at 10:00?

509
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:19,566
KIM: I just have other
meetings and I have to take

510
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,299
them. KOURTNEY: Let's just start

511
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,099
early and we can be done at
4:00.

512
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,065
KIM: But Kourtney, I have two
really important meetings, one's

513
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:27,099
a packaging meeting, one's my
baby shower.

514
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,632
If I don't have those meetings,
I cannot do either one.

515
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:33,265
KOURTNEY: Why can't you do
those today?

516
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:35,766
You know I have an important day
tomorrow and you said I would be

517
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:41,199
done early.
KIM: I honestly cannot

518
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,099
believe Kourtney.
Now she wants to pull my kids

519
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,332
out of school to do the shoot.
But I think we should keep my

520
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,632
kids in school, we should do our
meetings and glams so that when

521
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:53,332
they're out of school, we'll
just do a quick photo shoot.

522
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,099
Everyone understands if I don't
do this packaging meeting, then

523
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,199
I won't be able to launch my
collection, and I think it's so

524
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,999
selfish of Kourtney and I'm just
sad that she doesn't understand

525
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,366
that.
KRIS: Kim, it sounds like you

526
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:08,099
might be having a little bit of
a hard time just figuring it

527
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,065
out. Do you need some help?

528
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:12,366
KIM: Well, if Kourtney wasn't
so difficult...

529
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,032
KOURTNEY: If I'm out by 4:00,
that's all I need.

530
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:18,265
And I don't think I'm gonna get
there and change my mind.

531
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,399
And if no one's gonna be ready
on time, and I'm, like,

532
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,733
lingering around, then I'm
leaving at 4:00 p.m. and I don't

533
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:26,199
care what anyone says.
KIM: That was when my meeting

534
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,165
was, so...
KRIS: Where's the meeting?

535
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,666
KIM: It was supposed to be at
my house.

536
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,199
KRIS: Okay.
KIM: Unless I do it at 7:00

537
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,666
in the morning.
KOURTNEY: Do it at 7:00 in

538
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,232
the morning.
KRIS: Who are you meeting

539
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:36,332
with? Stop. Be nice.
KOURTNEY: Do it tonight.

540
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,232
KIM: No one wants you in the
(bleep) shoot so get the (bleep)

541
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:39,666
out of here.
KRIS: Okay, no, no, no...

542
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,199
KIM: Get the (bleep) out of
here and go.

543
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,132
Get the (bleep) out of here and
go.

544
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,766
No one wants you in the (bleep)
shoot.

545
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,466
I'm planning it.
KRIS: You guys just be nice

546
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:48,199
to each other.
KIM: I'm planning this shoot.

547
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,999
So we don't want you in the
shoot. I'm planning it.

548
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,999
KOURTNEY: I... Did I already
say this morning?

549
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,632
I didn't care to do it.
KIM: Then don't be in it

550
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:56,232
'cause you're so (bleep)
annoying.

551
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:57,999
KOURTNEY: I said this
morning, I don't care.

552
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,299
KIM: Perfect, then shut the
(bleep) up.

553
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,699
KOURTNEY: No, but it's like
I'm not scheduling around Kim.

554
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,399
KHLOE: Ladies, ladies, ladies.

555
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,165
KIM: So (bleep) annoying.
KRIS: You are annoying,

556
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,032
Kourtney. You're being annoying.
KHLOE: Hold on, ladies.

557
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:08,999
KOURTNEY: I'm not. That's
why, because Kim wants it around

558
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,399
her schedule?
KRIS: Do you know what we're

559
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,132
fighting about?
KIM: I've had my schedule

560
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:13,432
picked.
Who has the busier schedule?

561
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,332
Maybe if you had a (bleep)
business that you were

562
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,733
passionate about then you would
know what it takes to run a

563
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:20,366
(bleep) business.
But you don't, so don't even act

564
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:24,399
like you know what I'm talking
about.

565
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,766
KRIS: Kourtney, you just have
a way of rubbing people the

566
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:29,232
wrong way. KIM: Kourtney is out.

567
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:32,699
She will not be at the shoot
because she is the one that has

568
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,766
the annoying schedule.
I can't handle this anymore

569
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,265
'cause I... everyone is
dropping left and right from all

570
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:41,432
these schedule changes.
I need Kourtney to not be so

571
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:44,532
(bleep) annoying with a stick
up her ass like she (bleep) runs

572
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:47,165
this (bleep) because she
doesn't.

573
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:52,399
She's the least exciting to look
at, so she can be out.

574
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,766
She doesn't do (bleep).
She doesn't know what it's like

575
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:59,132
to actually have (bleep) work
to do.

576
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:03,432
You don't do (bleep).
KOURTNEY: You're a very

577
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:08,165
distraught, evil human being.
I'm not here to (bleep) be

578
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:12,232
mistreated by my (bleep)
bitch family.

579
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,132
NORTH: Welcome to the baby
shower!

580
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:15,999
KRIS: Thank you so much.
KENDALL: Is Kourtney coming?

581
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,233
KHLOE: I don't know.

582
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,132
KIM: I need Kourtney to not
be so (bleep) annoying with a

583
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:28,466
stick up her ass like she
(bleep) runs this (bleep)

584
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:32,132
because she doesn't.
She's the least exciting to look

585
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:37,099
at, so she can be out.
She doesn't do (bleep).

586
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,299
She doesn't know what it's like
to actually have (bleep) work to

587
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,499
do 'cause I don't know what the
(bleep) she does, so...

588
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,432
KRIS: Wow.
KHLOE: Kourtney's leaving?

589
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:46,165
KIM: Good.
KHLOE: She's not leaving.

590
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,632
KIM: Of course she should.
KHLOE: What a pussy.

591
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:50,199
KRIS: She was so rude.
KIM: But she'll think that

592
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,599
I'm rude and I was rude, but I
wanted to be rude 'cause she's

593
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,132
so (bleep) rude all the time.
KHLOE: Well, 'cause

594
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:57,132
everything revolves around her.
KIM: I'm just not taking her

595
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:59,165
(bleep) anymore.
KHLOE: Let me call her and

596
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,133
see why she left.

597
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,499
(phone dialing) KOURTNEY: Hello.

598
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,432
KHLOE: Hey. >> KOURTNEY: Hi.

599
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,599
KHLOE: Are you crying?
KOURTNEY: Yeah, I'm not here

600
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,199
to (bleep) be mistreated by
my (bleep) bitch family.

601
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,065
Kim saying that I'm the least
interesting to look at.

602
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:23,065
Who even speaks like that?
KHLOE: I mean, she's just

603
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:25,099
mad, so she's saying that.
People say things when...

604
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,666
KOURTNEY: Khloe, you don't
say things like that.

605
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:31,332
You guys just have really
different values than me.

606
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:36,065
I choose to be a mother to my
three kids.

607
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:39,632
I'm not here looking for another
job.

608
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:42,099
I already work enough, more
than I would like to.

609
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,599
KHLOE: Don't talk.
KIM: You don't do (bleep).

610
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,199
Take it off speaker.
KOURTNEY: It's not funny.

611
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,265
What's natural to me is being a
mother.

612
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:52,666
KRIS: No, everybody calm down.

613
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,332
KHLOE: I'm taking off speaker.

614
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,299
KRIS: Don't be mean, Kim!
(Kourtney continues talking)

615
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,132
KRIS: Oh, my God.
KHLOE: I'm sorry you feel

616
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,466
that way.
KIM: So you would think that,

617
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,699
you would think that-that you
would honestly think that we

618
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,499
have more jobs, so work around
our schedule.

619
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,499
You do whatever the (bleep) you
want to do and you don't do

620
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,632
(bleep), so be accommodating to
the people that actually do

621
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:13,065
(bleep). KOURTNEY: You're a very

622
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:18,199
distraught, evil human being.
I don't want to see you, okay?

623
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,499
I don't agree with who you are
as a human being.

624
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,399
KRIS: Say you're sorry.
KIM: Okay, well, if I said

625
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,265
something that hurt your
feelings, I'm sorry.

626
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:26,699
KOURTNEY: You're just a jerk
like that.

627
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,432
KRIS: Just say you didn't
mean it.

628
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:30,232
KOURTNEY: No, (bleep) you,
Kim. You meant it.

629
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:31,666
So (bleep) you. >> KRIS: No.

630
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:34,232
KOURTNEY: I am not going to
live my life around people that

631
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:36,232
make me not feel good on a daily
basis.

632
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:38,132
KHLOE: And you shouldn't.
KIM: Well, clearly you're

633
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,666
going through something else
'cause you're acting like a

634
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,199
(bleep) lunatic.
So maybe deal with that.

635
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,499
KHLOE: Oh my God, Kimberly.
That's not okay to say.

636
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,399
KIM: No, it is.
KOURTNEY: I don't choose to

637
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,733
be around somebody who talks to
me the way that you speak to me.

638
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:50,666
KIM: What I said to you was
rude and I wasn't even being

639
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:53,232
serious, so I said I'm sorry for
that.

640
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,366
But you're the most (bleep)
entitled person on the planet

641
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,165
when you work the least.
That's what I'm saying.

642
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,499
KRIS: Bring it down, bring it
down.

643
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,366
KOURTNEY: Why can't we
do the schedule at (bleep) 10:00

644
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:02,265
a.m. to 4:00?
I'm not here to do photo shoots

645
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:04,232
all day.
That is not important to me.

646
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:06,232
That is not one of my jobs.
KIM: So don't come. Perfect.

647
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,132
KRIS: Kourtney, we're just
trying... no! No, no!

648
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,666
KIM: I'll do the Christmas
card, me, my husband and my

649
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,766
kids, just me and him and the
kids.

650
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:13,532
KRIS: No, Kim. Kim, don't do
that.

651
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,265
KHLOE: Hello?
KOURTNEY: All everyone

652
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:17,532
(bleep) says is, "What's your
job?"

653
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,699
If I had enough money, I
wouldn't work.

654
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,199
I wouldn't do the show.
I would be a full-time mom.

655
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,599
That's what I want to do.
KHLOE: No one is saying you

656
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,265
need a second job.
My only argument was the job

657
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,466
that you do have, like, you're
not present for, but if you...

658
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,399
KOURTNEY: The guilt that I
carry every day from not being

659
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,332
at home when they get in from
school.

660
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,165
Not doing homework.
My kids suffer.

661
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:41,299
Honestly, it's like... we have
a disgusting family.

662
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,599
Like, I'm ashamed to be a part
of people that, like...

663
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,766
KHLOE: Oh, my God, you're
ashamed?

664
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:49,666
KIM: No one cares!
KOURTNEY: It's just gross

665
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:52,566
and I'm not going to be filming
with some (bleep) (bleep)

666
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:57,599
like Kim when she talks that way
about her own sister.

667
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,299
KHLOE: Well, okay, I love you
and I hope you feel better.

668
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,599
KRIS: Sorry, Kourt.
KOURTNEY: 'Kay, bye.

669
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,466
KHLOE: Bye.
Well, I don't think we're

670
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:14,199
disgusting or whatever she said.
KRIS: This is reminding me

671
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,432
of, years ago, when I used to
have to break up an argument

672
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:21,733
between my girls, and once a
referee, always a referee.

673
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:25,332
I feel like we're back in grade
school.

674
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:28,265
She's crying so hard.
KIM: I mean, was I rude

675
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:30,232
saying no one cares about
Kourtney?

676
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:32,432
Like, yeah, I know I'm being
rude.

677
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:34,265
I know I'm being rude.
KRIS: All of you cut really

678
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,699
deep. KIM: No, no, I know, but

679
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,599
she's cut really deep my whole
life.

680
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,632
I'm happy to apologize to her,
but I'm not gonna be like, "But"

681
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:45,199
please come to our shoot,"
'cause I don't care.

682
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,432
Kourtney's so (bleep) selfish.
I do not expect her to show up

683
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:51,299
to the Christmas card shoot, but
I've already booked it and we're

684
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,599
gonna do it with or without her.
KRIS: I'll see you at 8:00

685
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,332
tomorrow morning. >> KIM: Okay.

686
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,399
KRIS: For the meeting, okay?
I'll see you when I see you.

687
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,032
KHLOE: Oh, great, love you.
It's been wonderful.

688
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:02,399
KRIS: Love you, yeah, love
you guys, bye.

689
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,733
KHLOE: You feel okay?
KIM: I feel fine.

690
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:06,666
KHLOE: Okay.
KIM: I'm just not gonna

691
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:10,232
tolerate her (bleep) rudeness.
And I'll be ten billion times

692
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:13,632
ruder back to her every single
time until she just cries when

693
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:17,599
she sees me. KHLOE: Oh, my God.

694
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,032
KIM: Yeah, everyone walks
on (bleep) eggshells around her.

695
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:24,065
She's (bleep) rude.
She's so goddamn entitled.

696
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:26,366
She's such a mess, a (bleep)
gremlin.

697
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:32,232
I'm not gonna play around with
her anymore.

698
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:36,366
KOURTNEY: I'm just here to
say that I'm not gonna spend my

699
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:40,265
time, whether it's my sister or
not, with anybody that talks to

700
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,065
me that way.
KIM: So I said one (bleep)

701
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,499
up thing to you today.
KOURTNEY: I cannot handle and

702
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:52,432
be around you when you're just
(bleep) a bitch.

703
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:54,266
♪ ♪

704
00:31:57,734 --> 00:32:00,599
KOURTNEY: I have been working
on being better at communicating

705
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,132
my feelings, and I was so upset
earlier that I really didn't get

706
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:09,432
to say how I was feeling and I
really just wanted to come back

707
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:14,165
and say how I feel.
So I'm still upset, so I don't

708
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,666
want to sit here and like,
linger...

709
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,399
KHLOE: Oh, my gosh.
KOURTNEY: For days, but

710
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,632
I'm just here to say that I'm
not gonna spend my time, whether

711
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:25,632
it's my sister or not, with
anybody that talks to me that

712
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:28,632
way or thinks that way about me.
Everybody has different

713
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:30,499
priorities.
KIM: Well, I don't want to

714
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,733
spend my time with people that
don't make things that we plan a

715
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:34,733
priority and try to change
everything and aren't

716
00:32:34,734 --> 00:32:37,432
considerate of other people's
work obligations, 'cause some

717
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:40,466
people do have to work.
I do have to make this deadline

718
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:42,199
for the holiday collection or
I'm screwed.

719
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,232
KOURTNEY: So do it.
KIM: How is the person that

720
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:46,432
is the least busy...
KOURTNEY: How am I the least

721
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:48,132
busy? KIM: The most difficult?

722
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:51,232
You're not ever accommodating,
and everybody says it.

723
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:53,165
So if everyone says it...
KOURTNEY: I wasn't even going

724
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,499
to do the shoot that day, and
you asked me to do it on that

725
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,432
day, and you said it will be
this amount of hours, so we can

726
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:03,132
either not do it, or we can
do it at the time when I said.

727
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:06,165
KIM: I'm missing my baby
shower planning, and I'm missing

728
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:08,499
my meeting that's really
important so that I can do that

729
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,566
for you, and the problem...
KOURTNEY: Do whatever.

730
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:12,733
KIM: That I have with you
is you're just not considerate.

731
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:15,666
You're not like, "Thank you."
KOURTNEY: Okay, I don't

732
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:19,466
care, to be honest,
especially after you sit there

733
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:22,032
and talk to me like that today.
I just don't care.

734
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,699
KIM: Talk to you, Kourtney?
The way you've talked to me my

735
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,766
whole life, I could say so many
(bleep) things and, like, I'm

736
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:29,532
not harping on it.
So I said one (bleep) up

737
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:32,499
thing to you today.
KOURTNEY: Yeah, today.

738
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,099
KIM: So get over it.
KOURTNEY: At the end of the

739
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,632
day, when you die and when I
die, it doesn't matter how much

740
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:40,599
money is in our bank account,
but what matters to me is my

741
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,499
memories.
KIM: I don't care about that.

742
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,432
KOURTNEY: But it is to you,
because I don't give a (bleep).

743
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:47,499
KIM: I would think a memory
with your kids would be

744
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,132
important.
Like a Christmas card.

745
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:50,633
KOURTNEY: It is.

746
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:56,532
I'm not gonna be around people
that bring me down on a daily

747
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:59,265
basis and criticize if I'm this,
if I'm that...

748
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:04,299
I'm just doing my best.
So I-I cannot handle and

749
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,199
be around you when you're
just (bleep) a bitch.

750
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,666
Your words have-have meaning,
and they come from somewhere.

751
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:13,165
You didn't just make them up.
It's-It's really unkind.

752
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,499
KIM: I'm sorry if I said
something that was hurtful.

753
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,165
KOURTNEY: It's really unkind.
No, you're not sorry, Kim.

754
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,532
You (bleep) said it.
You can't take back words

755
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:23,599
that you say.
Words come from somewhere.

756
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,532
KHLOE: Okay, but she could
mean an apology if she does.

757
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:27,199
KOURTNEY: She could change
her outlook.

758
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,232
Do you think she's changing
her outlook?

759
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,632
Do you think she in any way
doesn't-doesn't feel the same

760
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:36,566
way that she felt this morning?
Cause I 1,000% know that she

761
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:39,599
doesn't feel any different.
KHLOE: I think we both have

762
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,332
to stop judging... or all of us
have to stop judging each other.

763
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,999
KOURTNEY: But every time I
come in this house or anywhere

764
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,099
lately when we're filming,
you guys judge.

765
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,065
KHLOE: The only thing that I
say to you is, Kourt, you gotta

766
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,999
be on time.
That's all I say to you.

767
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,766
KOURTNEY: And I've made an
effort to try to be on time.

768
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,999
KHLOE: I haven't been here
and I've... now I'm here, you

769
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,099
were on time today, and I said
thank you.

770
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,332
But that's all I've said to you.
And I said fully,

771
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:03,099
if you don't wanna have other
jobs, I don't care if you want

772
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,999
to or not.
I moved to another state, like,

773
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,632
I don't care about that stuff.
KOURTNEY: Good, and I will

774
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:10,032
move to another state at some
point, or another country.

775
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:12,632
But now is not the exact moment
in time.

776
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:16,299
But I cannot wait for that day,
and hopefully, like, just don't

777
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:22,999
have to have these fake
relationships.

778
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,099
KHLOE: With your sisters?
KOURTNEY: That I feel like

779
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,032
is forced. Why on earth...

780
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:28,632
