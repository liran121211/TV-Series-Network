It's, like, reality.
Like, she's coming any minute.

162
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,265
I think when you have a
surrogate, you don't feel the

163
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:44,132
everyday pains, and it just,
like, kind of creeps up on you.

It's just crazy how fast it
comes.

165

I got a call from my sister and
she was like, "All right, like",

166
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,165
the baby's head's low, I think
this is it."

167

having your baby before me and"

168

LA'REINA: I know.
CRANE: Well, let's hope your

a quickie look.

So, the head is-is getting down

looks normal and healthy.

"Hey, like, so who are we gonna

But I think after you've lost a

things more.

dating Kourtney, when I was,

208

got pregnant, and we started

who our child would go to if we

at that time, I hadn't lost

so weird.
SCOTT: I couldn't handle it.

218
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:07,265
I just wanted to shut down.
Then, later in life, once I saw

00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,232
We came here for Valentine's Day
once, and they had heart-shaped

319
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:11,199
raviolis. >> KHLOE: How cute.

320
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,733
What are you eating, Kourt?
What's good here?

321

KOURTNEY: I might get a salad.

322
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,265

breakfast all day?

323
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,699
KHLOE: Good choice.
KIM: What a treat.

324
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,499
You guys, there's nothing I
would want more than one

325
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,432
pancake.
Um, so, the baby scare...

326
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,232
KHLOE: Yeah. KIM: Thought it was

327
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:29,666
happening.
She said, "I'm having the worst"

328
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:34,299
cramps, I think it's happening."
So, I was like, "Oh, my God.

329
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,165
I don't have a hospital bag,
I don't have a this,

330
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,432
I don't have a that."
But then she went to Paul's, and

331
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:41,699
he said, "Nope, your cervix is
totally thick."

332
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,566
KHLOE: So how quickly can
that turn to be, like...

333
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:47,699
KIM: I don't know. A few days?

334
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,699
Then I started freaking, like,
I have no baby names.

335
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,165
Like, none.
KHLOE: But baby names is the

336
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,499
hardest part. KOURTNEY: Cruella.

00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,733
KOURTNEY: Guess what?
You don't have to give me an

790
00:38:52,734 --> 00:38:54,432
explanation.
I got three kids and I'm busy on

791
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,099
my own. >> KHLOE: And you're at

792
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,332
capacity.
KOURTNEY: No, I'm not at

793
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,065
capacity.
KHLOE: You want one more.

794
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:01,599
KOURTNEY: One to... one plus.
KHLOE: Kourtney.

795
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,165
KOURTNEY: Hmm.
KHLOE: Okay, we'll get into

796
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:07,299
that later, but it will be the
Keeks.

797
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,232
KOURTNEY: Congratulations.
(Khloe chuckles)

798
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,332
KIM: It is my honor.
And I will take such good care

799
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:15,099
of your kids. >> KHLOE: I know!

800
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,165
KOURTNEY: It's okay.
I've gone back and forth.

801
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,599
I told you.
First I had you, then I had Kim.

802
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,099
Then I have you again.
KHLOE: Oh! I'm back on the

803
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,065
list? KIM: What made you kick me

804
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:27,599
off? KOURTNEY: I decided that...

805
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,699
KIM: I'm so strict.
KOURTNEY: Your core moral

806
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,599
values. >> KHLOE: Oh, my God.

807
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,232
KOURTNEY: I mean, I'm a
little bit disappointed that I'm

808
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:38,232
not the guardian.
But honestly, you don't know

809
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:41,366
what your parenting style is
until you have kids.

810
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:46,099
So, I think once Khloe has her
own daughter and she is, you

811
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,999
know, really a mom, then maybe
she will realize that we have

812
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,766
more in common than she thinks
as far as parenting styles.

813
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:59,632
You never know, Khloe might
switch back to me.

814
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:02,632
Hopefully we never have to deal
with this, guys. So...

815
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,332
KHLOE: I know. We don't.
KIM: Yeah.

816
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:08,099
KHLOE: We don't. KIM: We don't.

817
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:16,100
KHLOE: We don't. ♪ ♪

818
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,032
KIM: My beautiful little baby
girl Chicago is finally here.

819
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:29,165
MJ: Oh, here's our baby.
KIM: The name Chicago,

820
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:31,165
everyone asks me where we came
up with that.

821
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:34,366
And Kanye's originally from
Chicago and the city is really

822
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:36,666
connected to his memory of his
mom.

823
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:41,366
And so, we went with Chicago.
MJ: (gasps) She's so

824
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:43,666
beautiful. KRIS: She's so cute.

825
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,567
KHLOE: Look at her hair.

826
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,666
KIM: Isn't she so cute?
MJ: She's so pretty.

827
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,265
Oh, my gosh.
KHLOE: She's so cute.

828
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:54,699
MJ: She looks a lot like you
in the mouth and nose.

829
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,733
(gasps) Hello.
KHLOE: Kim, her nose is

830
00:40:58,734 --> 00:41:02,065
really cute. MJ: So pretty, Kim.

831
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:04,332
KIM: Isn't she cute?
MJ: So beautiful.

832
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:07,399
She looks like you in the mouth.
KHLOE: Oh, God, she has so

833
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,032
much hair. >> MJ: So pretty.

834
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:11,999
Kris had that, too.
KHLOE: She's so cute and

835
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,165
little.
MJ: Kris had hair like that.

836
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,032
KIM: She has your hairstyle
right now.

837
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,332
KRIS: Yeah. >> KHLOE: Hi.

838
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:20,132
KRIS: We're twinning.
KIM: She does these really

839
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:22,399
mean faces.
KHLOE: She's very expressive

840
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,265
at so young.
KIM: Yeah, very expressive.

841
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:26,032
KHLOE: She's like me.
KIM: Like, she has this,

842
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:33,299
like, wrinkle right here, the
same one Kanye has.

843
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,165
The moment I laid eyes on my
baby, I was so in love.

844
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:42,165
Hi, cutie!
And I am just so excited to

845
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,233
have this addition to my family.

846
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,733
MJ: I was just gonna ask you,
how does it feel to be a mother

847
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:55,766
and not to carry the baby the
full time?

848
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:58,632
KIM: Honestly?
MJ: Without the worries of...

849
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:01,632
KIM: When it's done, I think
it was the best decision I ever

850
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:03,632
made. >> MJ: I do, too.

851
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:06,332
KIM: I think it was such an
amazing experience.

852
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:09,699
I would recommend it for anyone.
MJ: Well, I'm not thinking of

853
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,632
it, I just... >> KIM: Not you.

854
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:16,165
(laughter)
Um, I am, like, the biggest fan

855
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,466
of surrogacy.
All my fears of everything that

856
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:22,766
I thought was gonna happen,
like, am I gonna connect?

857
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:25,099
Am I gonna feel connected?
Am I...?

858
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,366
MJ: But you do.
KIM: All of that goes out the

859
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:31,766
door and you just, like,
instantly feel connected.

860
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:36,366
It's crazy how professional
surrogacy is and how instantly

861
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:40,466
when the baby came out, there
was no weird feeling that I was

862
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:42,499
so nervous about.
Am I gonna connect with the

863
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,466
baby?
Am I gonna feel the same way as

864
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:49,099
if it's, you know, me birthing
my kids?

865
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,099
And it was.
It was the same exact feeling.

866
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,366
So, that was instantly a relief
for me 'cause that was what I

867
00:42:56,367 --> 00:43:01,099
was most nervous about and I
just feel so lucky that I've had

868
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:09,032
such a good experience with
surrogacy.

869
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:11,399
MJ: You're gonna be good at
this, kiddo.

870
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,399
KHLOE: Oh, why thank you.
KRIS: You are.

871
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,666
MJ: You certainly will.
KHLOE: I'm just holding a

872
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:18,232
sleeping baby.
It's not hard yet.

873
00:43:18,233 --> 00:43:20,232
(chuckles)
MJ: This is why you're so

874
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:21,499
good. KHLOE: When you're holding

875
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,366
someone else's sleeping baby,
it's easy.

876
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:27,299
MJ: You look like a pro.
I want a picture of your body.

877
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,299
KIM: Oh, my body. KHLOE: Wow.

878
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,299
Don't ask her twice.
MJ (laughing): Wow. It's a

879
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,265
full photo shoot.
KHLOE: Are you smiling?

880
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:36,999
KRIS: Put your bikini on.
KHLOE: Look at her, she's

881
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,666
smiling. She's smiling.

882
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:42,666
KRIS: She's laughing at her
mom. (Laughs)

883
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:45,165
KOURTNEY: Oh, my God, did you
hear Kylie's in labor?

884
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:46,999
KIM: What?
KYLIE: I'm not trying to keep

885
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,332
it secret.
I'm really doing this for

886
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:51,065
myself.
KIM: Hey, Ky. Hi, Stormi.

887
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:53,165
KYLIE: Oh, my God.
KHLOE: You and Kourtney are,

888
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:55,265
like, at each other's throats
these days.

889
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:57,132
KOURTNEY: Mom (bleep) me in
so many ways.

890
00:43:57,133 --> 00:44:00,466
KRIS (crying): I never want
you to be disappointed in me.

891
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:04,199
KHLOE: Gabbana, hi.
(Gabbana whines)

892
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,065
She had a little bit of a
seizure.

893
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:07,999
KIM: She fully convulsed.
It's nearing time.
