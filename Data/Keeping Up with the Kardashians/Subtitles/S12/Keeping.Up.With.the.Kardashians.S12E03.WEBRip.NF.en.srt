00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,538
{\an8}[Khloé] So I walked into Rob

2
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,240
{\an8}with Blac Chyna at my house.

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:08,541
{\an8}Excuse me?

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,677
{\an8}Having Chyna over at my house

5
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,679
{\an8}without my knowledge is disrespectful

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,815
{\an8}because Chyna's Tyga's ex-girlfriend,

7
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,884
{\an8}and I just don't want that drama

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,185
{\an8}in my personal space.

9
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,821
{\an8}I told him, I said,
"You've burned your last bridge."

10
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,057
{\an8}Really, what a [bleep] nightmare.

11
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,961
{\an8}By the way, Rob's out of my house.

12
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,064
{\an8}Robert has moved in

13
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,967
{\an8}with, I guess, his girlfriend, Blac Chyna.

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,569
{\an8}He's trying to buy the house
right next door to her.

15
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,706
{\an8}You better not be paying
for his down payment.

16
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,607
{\an8}He doesn't deserve it.

17
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,842
{\an8}We have to be a little more understanding.

18
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,712
{\an8}No, we just have to stop babying him
and step back.

19
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,414
{\an8}Cut the cord.

20
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,385
[upbeat music]

21
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,557
[Mason] I wanna get in there.

22
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,325
Okay, climb up into the cart.

23
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,462
I cannot even get in this…

25
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,602
[Kourtney] Let's find some stuff, okay?

26
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,672
-I want to go on that side.
-Ooh, natural gum?

27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,208
-How exciting.
-[Mason] Can I taste?

28
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,409
Yeah.

29
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,444
{\an8}Yo, yo.

30
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,746
{\an8}-What up, my main man?
-[Mason] Hi. I'm trying gum!

31
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,148
Were… We just found natural gum.

32
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,550
-Natural gum?
-Yeah.

33
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,517
[Kourtney] Okay, let's try it.

34
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,485
[Mason] Yeah.

35
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,187
How is it?

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,756
-You like it, Mase man?
-Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,491
You like it enough
that you wanna purchase it?

38
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,860
Okay. I got cinnamon, also.

39
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,064
-[Mason] Yum! Yummy!
-Kourt, what about these?

40
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,532
[Kourtney] No, they're not organic.

41
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,633
[Mason] Oh, man!

42
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,001
Look, looky, looky!

43
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,671
They're organic, but they're not vegan.

44
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,272
-Damn.
-Those are not organic,

45
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,340
unfortunately.

46
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,842
I knew you were gonna say that.

47
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,678
I don't know how long
I could shop like this, but…

-…it, it seems all right.

[Kim] 'Cause they're, like, exploding.

56
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,417
I need them to calm down.

57
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,153
That's not very sanitary.

58
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,822
[Khloé] Question,

59
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,291
like, don't we kind of think
it's a miracle

60
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,327
that Rob, who doesn't even
show up to Christmas

61
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,396
for the past three years, literally.

62
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,764
He wouldn't leave his room.

63
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,367
But the fact that now
he's created a Snapchat,

64
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,637
the fact that now he wants
to be so public blows my mind.

65
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,539
She gave him confidence.

66
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,907
More power to her.

67
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,077
[Kim] After Rob and Blac Chyna
started dating,

68
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,613
Rob is now, like, all over social media

69
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,582
and, like, out and about.

70
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,918
[Kim] Like, he hasn't been like this
in so long

71
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,453
that even though there's been some drama,

72
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,289
if this is what it takes, then…

73
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,890
I don't care who he's dating.

74
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,426
I'm so happy that he's just,

75
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,562
you know, feeling better about himself.

76
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,565
If some [bleep] is getting him

77
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,401
to remove his braces
and shave his beard and work out…

78
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,836
My thing is, do what you want,

79
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,939
do what makes you happy, whatever.

80
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,308
But he should have said to us,

81
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,710
"Hey, guys, this is how I feel."

82
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,146
"I can't help who I love
and I fell in love with her,"

83
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,747
but Kylie should know this.

84
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,184
He just has no loyalty.

85
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,552
He has no loyalty.

86
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,622
[Khloé] Chyna is Tyga's ex,

87
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,691
and Kylie's dating Tyga now,

88
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,359
so it's pretty complicated.

89
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,528
But am I happy he's out and about?

90
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:52,165
For sure. Am I disappointed
that Rob isn't talking to me

91
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,633
after he got out of my house?

92
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,634
Yeah.

93
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,270
'Cause I've been
the only one that stood by him

94
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,872
and defended him
and wanted the best for him.

95
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,541
So that's just where it gets frustrating.

96
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,277
-Oh. You just…
-Totally.

00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,045

00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,974
[Martyn] That's good.

176
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,041
Nice, love!

177
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,543
[Kourtney]
Too bad I don't work in this office.

178
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,778
[laughter]

179
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,614
[Martyn] Beauty, gnarly, gorgeous.

180
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,549
[Kourtney] I've been working on my house

181
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,418
for the last two years,

182
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,153
hoping that it would be

183
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,388
on the cover of <i>Architectural Digest.</i>

184
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,524
I'm obsessed with interior design,

185
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,993
and so I'm just so happy.

186
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,795
This is like a dream come true.

187
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,631
[Kourtney] So I guess we're shooting this

188
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,000
other cover at Khloé's now.

189
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,235
-This is, like, my thing…
-Mm-hmm.

190
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,874
…and she doesn't really care
as much about interiors as I do,

191
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,709
-'cause I'm, like, obsessed.
-Mm-hmm.

192
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,046
Like, I'm, like, so excited.
This is, like--

193
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,514
[hairstylist] You've wanted this forever.

194
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,185
Literally a dream… come true.

195
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,989
{\an8}[upbeat music]

196
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,691
{\an8}[Martyn] <i>Beautiful, that's lovely.</i>

197
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,662
It was nice when you had
your hands together around, too.

198
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,297
That's lovely, beautiful.

199
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,532
[Kourtney] The fact that
I'm sharing this with Khloé

200
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,733
is just crazy.

201
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,535
We're the first siblings

202
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,071
to be on an <i>Architectural Digest</i> cover,

203
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,907
so it's just such an amazing day.

204
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,343
[Kourtney] All right, we're
ready to rock and roll.

205
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,811
[Khloé] Let's shoot this.

206
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,046
[indistinct chatter]

207
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,547
Mason, smile.

208
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,515
[Martyn] Gorgeous!

209
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,283
Oh, you look great!

210
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,118
Lovely, that's fantastic!

211
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,987
Look over at Kourtney for me, Mason.

212
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,389
-[Khloé] Mase, look at Mom.
-[Martyn] Yes!

213
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,058
Lovely, that's good!

214
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,727
[upbeat music]

215
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,067
{\an8}[Kourtney]
<i>Was one of these salads for you?</i>

216
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,169
[Kim] Yeah, but I don't want it.

217
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,340
I think we're gonna get
this big Rick Owens bed.

218
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,575
Like, have you seen the one that's, like…

219
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,345
-goes up, like, really high?
-[Kourtney] Mm-mm.

220
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,447
And it has, like, a border around.

221
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,548
It's really cool, you'd like it.

222
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,649
Is it wood?

223
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,750
They had it in marble,

224
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,919
but we're gonna have to make it
in, like, wood or something.

225
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,420
Yeah, you don't want a marble bed.

226
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,256
No, it's, like, way too hard.

227
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,525
You can only have that if you're, like…

228
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,393
-Never.
-Single and, like…

229
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,594
Not even.

230
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,263
Someone could bang their head on it

231
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,397
if you're hooking up.

232
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,431
Yeah.

233
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,166
-The marble looks so--
-[Kourtney] And die.

234
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,134
Yeah.

235
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,303
So it's just not, like, comfy.

236
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,108
So, did you hear that, uh,
Rob bought a house?

237
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:05,645
Yeah, so what is the deal?
Like, Khloé doesn't know?

238
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,313
I guess not, but--

239
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,916
She's gonna, like, freak
that he has, like, his own house,

240
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,817
-right down the street.
-Yeah, but I think she'll be--

241
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,019
It's so good for him.

242
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,353
I think also, it's like,

243
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,156
it wasn't working out with him
being there, so…

244
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,157
Yeah.

245
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,459
But she's definitely gonna freak out.

246
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,861
Yeah, but I think it's so good

247
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,429
that he's, like, you know, on his own.

248
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,797
He's, like, saved his money.

249
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,732
And he's, like, doing his own thing.

250
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,001
I mean, there's just been a lot of drama.

251
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,072
I feel like Mom needs to tell Khloé.

252
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,875
I feel like Rob should tell her,
but have they even spoken?

253
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,343
I don't know.

254
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,012
I think Khloé and Rob always
had a really special bond.

255
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,681
[Robert] Are you going to school today?

256
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,249
-Yes!
-[Robert] You are?

257
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,383
No, he's not.

258
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,352
[Kim] <i>Like, they were really close in age,</i>

259
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,054
{\an8}<i>and they were BFFs.</i>

260
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,923
[laughter]

261
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,226
The point of the matter is I miss you.

262
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,862
You make everything feel like
we're back at home.

263
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,497
I'm happy.

264
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,765
You're happy, good.

265
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,866
[Kim] They lived together.

266
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,934
They have such a history together.

267
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,504
So I think Khloé's just extra hurt that

268
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,207
he still hasn't called her
since he moved out.

269
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,675
So I understand it,

270
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,444
and I really do feel bad for her.

271
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,417
[upbeat music]

272
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,124
{\an8}[Khloé] <i>So tired already.</i>

273
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:26,859
[stylist] Cancel, cancel.

274
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,295
[Khloé] No, I don't wanna go.
How do we get…

275
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,496
Kourtney, are you going out?

276
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,632
-Can you go with Kourtney?
-God…

277
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,966
Jen will go with Corey.

278
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,968
Jen, is your husband in town?

279
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,503
{\an8}-No, so Jen's gonna…
-No.

280
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,772
{\an8}-…come with us, Khlo!
-He's gone.

281
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,774
She might be going just with you.

282
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,875
[Kourtney] Why?

283
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,845
[Khloé] I'm just, this seems
like such a bore!

284
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,912
[Jen] It's gonna be fun.

285
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,381
You just need to get, like, into it.

286
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,949
But I feel like we could…

287
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,752
Like, I'm having such a nice time
in glam so far.

288
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,154
Well, it gets better.
I can tell you that much.

289
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,922
We have jobs in the morning.

290
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,025
How is everyone gonna work tomorrow?

291
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,927
[Khloé] I'm not as young
as I once used to be.

292
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,797
Khloé, you only live once.

293
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,132
[Jen] Yep, she's right.

294
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,768
[Khloé] It's nine o'clock, you guys.

295
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,037
[Kourtney] What, are you saying
it's early or late?

296
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,571
It's super early.

297
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,673
[Kourtney] Let's call Corey.

298
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,608
[Khloé] I don't know Corey like that.

299
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,743
Like, we're just gonna FaceTime Corey?

300
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,112
[Kourtney] Yeah, I FaceTime him
literally every day.

301
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,616
[Khloé] I love Corey.
I think he's super nice.

302
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,751
And I love how happy my mom is.

303
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,186
[Khloé] But still, I'm not, like,

304
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,055
hanging out with Corey
one-on-one all the time

305
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,457
because I, like,
am respecting everyone's space.

306
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,660
Like, Kourtney and Corey are like…

307
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,761
conjoined twins.

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,965

-I know.

00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,902
-Where's your little bitch at?

Oh, hey!

314
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,814
So, Kourtney and I were just
wondering what you doing?

315
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,516
[Corey] <i>Justin wants me
to come meet him at Nice Guy,</i>

316
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,185
<i>so I'm about to roll over there now.</i>

317
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,287
-Okay, well…
-What should we do?

318
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,623
[Corey] <i>I mean, I think y'all should,
like, meet at Nice Guy,</i>

319
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,659
<i>and then let this be like
a little headquarters,</i>

320
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,593
<i>and then we'll just go from there.</i>

321
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,663
[Kourtney]
We can have a drink and figure it out.

322
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,198
[Corey] <i>Yeah, whatever y'all want.</i>

323
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,400
-[Kourtney] Headquarter it up!
-<i>I'll be there in, like, 15 minutes.</i>

324
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,935
[Kourtney] We're gonna headquarter it up.

325
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,871
[Corey] <i>Yeah, yeah, that's headquarters
for now… Nice Guy.</i>

326
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,873
Okay, see you soon, Dad.

327
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,710
I always thought my dad
would wear a gold diamond chain.

328
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:25,878
[Corey] <i>All right, see y'all soon.</i>

329
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:26,979
See you soon.

{\an8}[Kylie] <i>So I just learned</i>

333
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,561
that you can eat the skin off
of a kumquat.

334
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,796
[Kris] I've never had one.

335
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,367
Is it sour?

336
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,536
Is it good?

337
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,472
My mouth is getting all weird,
like it's sour now.

338
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,574
You eat the skin.

339
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,612
Oh! Oh, that is so disgusting!

340
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,215
You are such a piece of [bleep]
for making me taste that!

-I like it.
-Mm-mm.

Hi!

345
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,792
Wanna see how cool I am today?

346
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,127
[Kylie] So cool.

347
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,829
[Kris] How great is that?

348
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,764
The cover of <i>Architectural Digest</i>

349
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,065
is a big deal.

350
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,567
[Kourtney] It's super cute, right?

351
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,803
-[Kylie] Mm-hmm.
-[Kris] I love the living room.

352
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,338
-Me too.
-It's so beautiful.

353
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,641
[Kris] And look at your backyard.
Look at you.

354
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,177
The only thing I cannot stand

355
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,479
-is a couple things.
-Okay.

356
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,449
So her room, these drapes and chairs
have got to go.

357
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,852
-It just pisses the [bleep] out of me.
-Ooh.

358
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,023
I cannot stand that flower arrangement.

359
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,891
Cannot stand those pieces of art,

360
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,860
even though they are major art,
so it's fine.

361
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,261
Khloé looks beautiful--

362
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,930
But this black couches,

363
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,099
I would personally make them white,
just for life.

364
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,002
Kourtney sometimes thinks
she's a design critic.

365
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,939
And now she's criticizing Khloé's house?

366
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,740
[Kris] Khloé's house

367
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,809
is in <i>Architectural Digest</i>, also,

368
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,111
so Khloé must be doing something right.

369
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,982
[Kourtney groans]

370
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,685
Oh, oh!

371
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,453
-[chuckles]
-[Kris] I can't.

372
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,955
How's that kumquat?

373
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,292
[chuckles]
What?

374
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,161
Very, very interesting.

375
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,462
[Kylie chuckles]

376
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,800
[upbeat music]

377
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,272
{\an8}[Kim] I wonder how my hair looks today?

378
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,907
[Khloé] Why?

379
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,743
'Cause this is so short.
I feel like it doesn't blend.

380
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,911
I love your hair.

381
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,847
I just feel like I look ugly today.

382
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,948
Well, look at me.

383
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,183
I look like a [bleep] lumberjack.

384
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,417
I love it.

385
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,953
[Kim] Wait, do you find it at all

386
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,357
bizarre that Kourtney and Corey…

387
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,725
-Are BFF?
-…are BFF.

388
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,894
Like, every photo I see of them,

389
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,795
it's like they're leaving The Nice Guy.

390
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,697
-They're going to dinner…
-That's all they do is go to The Nice Guy.

391
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,599
They're doing that,
and I'm like, "What is going on?"

392
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,601
Did you see the hike they went on
and they're, like, posing together?

393
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:03,669
Yes!

394
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,671
-[Khloé] That was like--
-Wait, that looked like a family photo.

395
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,972
That was a family photo,

396
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,707
-but not their family.
-That was so inappropriate.

397
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,542
It was so ina-- Right?

398
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,413
I knew it wasn't just me
that thought it was weird

399
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,981
that Kourtney and Corey are spending

400
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,249
so much time together.

401
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,152
[Kim] Him and Kourtney,
they go out at night together.

402
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,287
They, like, hang out in the day.

403
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,756
They go on hikes.
Like, they're always together.

404
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,991
So I think I need to talk to Kourtney,

405
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,693
just to kind of call her out on it.

406
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,561
I was, like, uncomfortable.

407
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,163
Like, out of this world.

408
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,765
That's the nail in the coffin for me.

409
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,766
Seriously.

410
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,968
-Hashtag Okurrr.
-Okurrr.

411
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,937
-Okurrr, okurrr, okurrr.
-[laughs]

412
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,039
[upbeat music]

413
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,245
{\an8}[Kris] Come on, Sean's gonna make us
a yummy lunch.

414
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,113
Thank you.

415
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,548
[Kris] That looks beautiful.

416
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,884
[phone ringing]

417
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,354
-Hey, Rob.
-[Rob] <i>Hey, Mom.</i>

418
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,456
{\an8}Hi. Say hi to Kourtney.

419
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,557
{\an8}Hi, Rob.

420
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,692
[Rob] <i>Hey, Kourtney.</i>

421
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,728
We tried to FaceTime you
yesterday, the kids.

422
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,030
Mason lost a tooth yesterday.

423
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,231
His second tooth.

424
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,933
[Rob] <i>That's it?</i>

425
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,870
<i>I feel like he should've,
should've lost way more teeth by now.</i>

426
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,472
I don't think so. I think it's like

427
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,441
-when you're six.
-You start when you're six.

428
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,743
[Rob] <i>I don't know.
My son started kind of early, but--</i>

429
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,511
Yeah, he did.

430
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,613
What's your son's name, Rob? I forgot.

431
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,848
[Rob] <i>Robert.</i>

432
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:23,882
[laughs]

433
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,784
I thought it was Cornelius.

434
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,921
[Rob] <i>His name is Robert,
uh, III, actually.</i>

435
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:33,125
It feels really good to talk
to Rob on the phone

436
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,995
when he's in such a good mood
'cause it's been a long time.

437
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,896
[Kris] He's always had a sense of humor,

438
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,632
and to get that back is everything.

439
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,270
Well, um, we move you in on Wednesday.

440
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,006
[Rob] <i>What?</i>

441
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:47,973
Yeah.

442
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,341
Are you excited?

443
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,810
[Rob] <i>Yeah, I can't wait
to put my [bleep] all over that bed.</i>

444
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,179
Me too.

445
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,981
[laughs]

446
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,983
[Rob laughs]
<i>No, I'm just kidding.</i>

447
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,853
[Kris] Rob's excited about his new house.

448
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,355
And I can tell that Rob

449
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,657
is getting really excited
about life again.

450
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,960
And I just wanna make sure that he feels

451
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,231
and remains independent and on his game.

452
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,566
So I wanna help him get set up,

453
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,970
and basically, help in any way
that I can if he needs me.

454
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,805
KoKo loco.

455
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,040
All right, I'll talk to you later.

456
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,708
-Khloé's just walking in.
-Hi, guys.

457
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,043
-[Rob] <i>Okay, love you.</i>
-Love you.

458
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,511
-Bye, honey.
-Hi, Khlo.

459
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,813
[Khloé] Oh, hello.

460
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,114
[Mason] I lost my tooth last night!

461
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,450
He lost his tooth last night.
Did I tell you?

462
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,751
[Kris] Wait, what did
the Tooth Fairy bring him?

463
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,819
Oh, hello.

464
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,287
-A hundred bucks.
-Ask him…

465
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,256
-What, Kourtney?
-And what else?

466
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,525
-A hundred bucks?
-[Khloé] Let me see your mouth.

467
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,327
Oh, that is so disgusting.

468
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,329
[Khloé] Kourtney, you gave him $100?

469
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,598
No, I tried to find
the two-dollar bills last night.

470
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,700
-I gave her a stack…
-So you deprived… So, instead…

471
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,902
-…of two-dollar bills.
-Let's do 100?

472
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,703
That's all I had in my bedroom.

473
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,640
I'm going to your house
and I'm ripping out a tooth.

474
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,808
I'll just tell you that.

475
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,977
[Kris] So I wanted to tell you something.

476
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,312
Oh, my god.

477
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,281
[Kris] Um, so you know how I helped

478
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,383
-Kylie get a house?
-[Khloé] Okay.

479
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,886
So Robert is doing the same thing.

480
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,056
-[Khloé scoffs]
-And he's getting a house.

481
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,592
[upbeat music]

482
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,862
[Kourtney] You think it's good?

483
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,197
It's really good.

484
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,566
[Kris] It's his money.

485
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,000
It's not his money 'cause I know

486
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,268
-how much money he has in his account.
-Yes, it is.

487
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,970
He has enough money for a down payment.

488
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:25,938
-Yes, he does.
-You are

489
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,873
one of the world's

490
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,741
-biggest liars.
-Biggest enablers.

491
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,276
-I'm not a liar.
-You are lying.

492
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,014
{\an8}-[Kris] Yes, he does.
-[Khloé] You are

493
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,549
{\an8}one of the world's

494
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,885
-biggest liars.
-Biggest enablers.

-I'm not a liar.
-You are lying.

496
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,355
No, he has the money for the down payment.

497
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,092
[Khloé] Like, seriously, everyone…

498
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,360
[Kris] What? What did I do now?

499
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,496
-Why are you so angry all the time?
-Oh, I'm not…

[fake coughing]

501
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,032
Do you have a cough?

502
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,135
I'm just allergic to [bleep].

503
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,103
-[Kris] Oh, okay.
-[fake coughing]

504
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,507
I would have such deep fights in my family

505
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,475
because I was "enabling" Rob

506
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,943
by letting him live with me.

507
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,412
[Khloé] And then the one person
who yelled at me the most,

508
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,982
which is my mom, now she's helping Rob?

509
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,683
I just find it mind-blowing.

510
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,286
[Kris] He's very excited

511
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,288
and I want you to be supportive

512
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,090
-and get on board.
-I don't even talk to Rob.

513
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,925
I know, but just if you happen to see him.

you hurt North's feelings,"

00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,808
I remember that one. It's perfect.

685
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,111
-[Kourtney] I don't like this rug in here.
-No?

686
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,279
[Kourtney] I don't.

687
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,148
[Faye] Kris?

688
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,716
[Kris] He loves it.

689
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:56,354
[Faye] Honey, I really, really, really dig
the rug in there.

690
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,490
I think it speaks to your father.

691
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,793
-It just reminds me of…
-[Kris] Yeah.

692
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,228
-What?
-[Faye] That piece, Kourtney?

693
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,863
The rug in… in his office.

694
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,964
I dig it.

695
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,499
-[Kourtney] Really?
-It reminds me of your father.

696
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,601
I think it brings an old world
because we've got

697
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,469
-so much edgy stuff going on.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

698
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,239
I just feel like it's so traditional

699
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,807
for, like, Rob.

700
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,342
[Kris] What do you think, Rob?

701
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,444
Honestly, I'm so bad with everything.

702
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,013
We can't have feminine [bleep] in here.

703
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,749
So we're gonna go through it
and guess who's gonna help you?

704
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,051
-You.
-Me.

705
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,455
Let's remove the stuff
and then see if we like it.

706
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:34,759
It's fine if you're a female,
but maybe not for,

707
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,963
for like a young, dope guy,
who has the dopest sister

708
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,666
with the best taste in interiors
on the planet.

709
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,368
[Kim] Kourtney's just, like, taking over.

710
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,869
I mean, I get it.

711
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,405
Kourtney's on the cover
of <i>Architectural Digest,</i>

712
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,074
but still, it doesn't mean she's, like,

713
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,642
the expert of everything.

714
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,945
-Oh, what happened here, Robert?
-What?

715
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,815
-Hmm?
-All of the good stuff is now all gone?

716
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,084
I don't know, Kourt… That's Kourt. Kourt…

717
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,586
-Okay, that's gonna upset me.
-[Rob and Corey] Talk to Kourtney.

718
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:02,654
[Faye] Kourtney?

719
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,756
-Let's talk to Kourtney.
-[Faye] Kourtney!

720
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,325
Kourtney cannot control the whole show.

721
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,894
Kourtney, you totally messed up
my little thing going on

722
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,895
that I really liked.

723
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,330
[Kourtney] What? I know.

724
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,632
So I really liked it,

725
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:17,135
but I feel like it's really cool
for, like, a girl.

726
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,839
-[Faye] A girl?
-[Kourtney] Yes.

727
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:22,841
Those are the most masculine pieces.

728
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:23,908
-[Kourtney] Really?
-Yes.

729
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,443
Rob said he didn't like them.

730
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,978
Because you told him

731
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,613
-that you didn't like them.
-No, no, no. I said…

732
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,148
No, no, no, I didn't. I swear I said…

733
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,616
-Don't put it on me.
-I said, "What do you like

734
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,751
on top of here?"

735
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,852
And he said, "Nothing."

736
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:38,023
[Faye] Okay, now it was so exciting
and now it's so boring.

737
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,491
[Rob] Look what you did, Kourtney.

738
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,194
[Kris] Faye did this because she loves me

739
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,396
and she loves Rob.

740
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,297
And she's really good at what she does.

741
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:47,899
So for Kourtney to come in

742
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,202
and criticize anything
is just embarrassing.

743
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,504
Now I'm really sad.

744
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,975
[upbeat music]

745
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,047
{\an8}[Kim] <i>Hello?</i>

746
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,451
[Kris] I'm in the office.

747
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,488
-Hi.
-Hi.

748
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,458
Your hair looks good.
I like the light ends.

749
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,226
-[Kim] Thank you.
-Yeah, it looks pretty.

750
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,162
It's just annoying
because they're all pieces

751
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,763
this way so close

752
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,898
'cause I didn't really dye my hair.

753
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,199
Mm-hmm.

754
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,935
So all the light pieces
are just, like, these tape-ins.

755
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,070
Lame.

756
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,671
[Kris] Lame. Speaking of lame…

757
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,340
-your sister.
-Mm-hmm.

758
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,010
-Kourtney Kardashian.
-Mm-hmm.

759
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:35,714
Designer, decorator, home enthusiast…

760
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,815
[both] Extraordinaire.

761
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,451
She is really

762
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,353
getting a little carried away
with herself.

763
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,923
I feel really bad because, you know,

764
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:49,461
I asked Faye to help me move Rob
into his new house,

765
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,296
and so we were having so much fun,

766
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,898
and she came in and just pretty much

767
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,102
made us feel like we were idiots.

768
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:03,041
And she just feels like she's the expert

769
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,876
on all things design and decorating.

770
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,077
She's getting so crazy.

771
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,113
She's pretty good at it,
but she is getting crazy.

772
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,582
I just felt really bad for Faye…

773
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,950
[Kim] That's Kourtney.

774
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,818
[Kris] I think I'm gonna say something.

775
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,653
It's just not okay to be that rude.

776
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,055
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

777
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,891
Kourtney's become, like, the new diva.

778
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,959
[Kris] Yeah.

779
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,494
[phone chimes]

780
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,864
Speak of that little devil,
she's texting me now.

781
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:32,303
[upbeat music]

782
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,176
{\an8}[Kim] I have, like, so much work to do,

783
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,744
I just can't function.

784
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:41,780
[Corey] You're always working.

785
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,150
So what is going on?

786
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,818
[Corey] Nothing much.

787
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:47,919
Same old, same old,

788
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,823
just taking care of your queen and…

789
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,424
What a fun job you have.

790
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:56,728
And why do you like her?

791
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,063
Because we're both crazy.

792
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,632
She just shows hers more than I…

793
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,467
She… I show mine. I just think mine.

794
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,235
-She…
-Yeah.

795
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,470
…let it out all day, so,

796
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,272
but we've been coexisting good.

797
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,240
It's fun, she's just fun.
We're just alike.

798
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,342
-Yeah.
-She's just mom

799
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,812
-and I'm just me.
-Yeah.

800
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,380
[Kim] I'm always with Corey.

801
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,549
But I just don't feel like I've, you know,

802
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,084
really taken the time
to sit down and talk to him.

803
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,920
And Corey's been around for a while.

804
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,354
I don't think he's going anywhere.

805
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,390
So, you know, maybe it's time

806
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,792
that I do really, you know,
start hanging out with him

807
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:28,860
and getting to know him better.

808
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,496
Do you, um, have any brothers or sisters?

809
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,832
Yeah, I've got half-sisters,

810
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:34,999
-a half-brother…
-Really?

811
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,837
They're younger than me,
so I, I was like, long gone

812
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:39,838
and kind of like

813
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,940
our worlds never were together.

814
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,608
Hmm, interesting.

815
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,476
But my family dynamics is not y'all's,

816
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:46,978
so what y'all see as normal,

817
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,647
I don't see that [bleep] as,
like, it's not like that.

818
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,584
Like, I have my,
like my closer cousins with me

819
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,885
were on my dad's side,

820
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,887
but they all, they were always
way older than me,

821
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,289
but they used to babysit me
when I was little.

822
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:02,093
And, um, I never had the house
full of people.

823
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,262
It was like me and my dad,
then my friends.

824
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,965
Then, like, his girlfriend's kids

825
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,967
would become, like,
my sisters and brothers.

826
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,603
Like I never had this dynamic,
this [bleep] that y'all have,

827
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,071
I don't, it just don't exist.

828
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,642
-Y'all got a great--
-So because you don't have that,

829
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,877
like a close family,

830
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,546
is that why you hang around
Kourt and the kids so much?

831
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,281
[Corey] Yeah, you guys are family.

832
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,251
[Kim] Listening to Corey talk was just

833
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,486
all coming together and making sense to me

834
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,923
why he loves spending time with our family

835
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,691
and with, you know Kourtney and the kids.

836
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,594
[Corey] A lot of my friends
and people I've met along my journey

837
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,429
have become closer to me than my family.

838
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,331
-Yeah.
-You know what I'm saying?

839
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,466
I mean, I got all kinds of friends.

840
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,568
I got big friends, I got little friends.

841
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,503
North is your little friend.

842
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,604
That's my girl.

843
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,806
[Kim] I think sometimes when
you have such a big family,

844
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,508
it's so like the norm

845
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,844
but I hear about Corey's life

846
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,080
and it just, you know,
makes me feel really lucky

847
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,916
that I do have such a big family.

848
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,084
[Kim] So to find someone
that just kind of fits in,

849
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,153
and is so chill, and goes with the flow,

850
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,923
is like really, I think,
a blessing to my mom.

851
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,293
-[Kim] Where does your dad live?
-Atlanta.

852
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,228
-So he's still there?
-Mm-hmm.

853
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,563
Now, my dad now, me and him tight.

854
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,399
I… I talk to my dad every day.

855
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,967
I love my dad to death.

856
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,502
I mean, if it wasn't for my dad,

857
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:18,903
there's no telling where my life would be.

858
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,005
So, y'all are like my dad.

859
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,074
Yeah, I wanna meet him.

860
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,411
Yeah, so I think I might
take your mom to Atlanta.

861
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,046
That would be fun. You should.

862
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,714
I'm thinking about it.

863
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,716
That would be so fun. She would like it.

the opportunity to do something

876
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,016
is really fun.

877
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,484
And to also to be able to do it

878
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,553
with my daughter and my girlfriend,

879
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,521
it's gonna be a fun day.

-Anita Taiton.

-Rita?
-It's Anita.

-[Rita] Ladies…
-Anita! Sorry.

Mm. So yummy.

897
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,662
I didn't really eat very much
for a couple days.

898
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:52,864
Why not?

899
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,699
I was just so busy.

900
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,269
How is the Rob move going?

901
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,139
-It's done.
-Good.

902
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,074
Just doing the blinds on Monday

903
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,777
and the Internet goes in on Monday.

904
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,578
Hope he says "thank you" to you.

905
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,048
He did, yesterday.
I thought he was gonna cry.

906
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,216
He was so sweet.

907
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,985
I want you to come see the house.

908
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,220
I will.

909
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,955
-Whenever he feels like inviting me.
-I think you'd really like it.

910
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:19,824
You don't think it's weird

911
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,626
that Rob, like, hasn't called me one time?

912
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,327
I don't think it's weird.

913
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,997
I think it's certainly
disappointing for you

914
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,865
and I would want him to call me, too,

915
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,234
but I think you guys just see
this whole thing differently.

916
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,736
And I think he knows

917
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,671
that he probably should've
talked to you about it,

918
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,741
but felt that you were just
very judgmental.

919
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,043
He doesn't really hold a grudge.

920
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,579
What would he hold a grudge over?

921
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,214
-I mean, he doesn't--
-Me taking care of him

922
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,749
for six years?

923
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:46,651
[Khloé] What I'm so confused about is

924
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,487
why Rob has such issues with me,
all of a sudden.

925
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,788
I'm allowed to say

926
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:53,124
I don't want strangers in my home.

927
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,827
I just want Rob to reach out to me,

928
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,095
so I'm just waiting.

929
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,196
It's the waiting game.

930
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,665
Boys are different
and he's very sensitive.

931
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,567
I didn't realize how sensitive he is.

932
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,336
And I think he…

933
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,039
loves you very much.

934
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,307
He shows it.

-[Kris] Hey, guys.

00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:35,733
I want you guys to know,
this is a non-organic banana

941
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,104
because it is [bleep] hard to open, "A"…

942
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,941
Oh… [bleep].

943
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,544
And bananas aren't meant to be this large.

944
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,312
-[Kim] Really?
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.

945
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,082
What color is an egg yolk supposed to be?

946
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,517
Orange.

00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,085
Good answer.

should I get?

949
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,424
-[Kourtney] Mmm…
-Like, do you just get 'em

950
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,660
at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond,
or, like, what's the…

951
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,495
I'm not telling you where I got mine

952
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,930
'cause I don't want you to copy me.

953
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,366
[Kris] You know, Kourtney,

954
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,635
there's something I really wanna
talk to you about.

955
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,170
[Kourtney] All righty.

00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:15,106

-Mm-hmm.
-And your home

00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,543
-is insanely beautiful.
-Mm-hmm.

959
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:21,312
And I couldn't be happier
for my firstborn child.

-Mm-hmm.
-Believe me.

961

But sometimes,

962
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,954
you tend to be the authority

on everything decorating.

964
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,728

Do you want Rob to just live with things

967
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,502
that are very feminine?

968
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,504

come over and lie?

or whatever she did,

970
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,741
it was fine, but, like, you can't,

971
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,643
-like, fault someone for--
-But don't do it in a day.

Who wants to do their house in a day?

How are you going to expect me
to do my work

974
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:03,087
if you don't let me do so freely

975
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,790
and have something called an opinión?

976
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,391
Which is very valued

977
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:11,762
and many, many, many people
around the world would love it.

But I'm sorry if I came off insulting.

983

That wasn't my intention.

984
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,677
I really didn't mean to insult
all of the hard work

985

that they put into the home.

986
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,449
But I also just really
want Rob to be happy

987
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:34,018
and I know that he doesn't wanna hurt
my mom's feelings,

988
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,153
so I'll hurt her feelings for him.

hang up my mover's hat.

decides to move…

Everybody knows what they're doing,

994
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,636
and I think everybody's
ready to go out on their own

995
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,070
and, like, leave the nest.

00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,372
I feel you.

You look stressed on your face

-I think just the sun.
-Yeah.

you won't be sending Rob
a housewarming gift.

No.

-Like…
-No.

or to say "hi."

Or, like, "I miss you," like…

and you're just, like, you're okay.

just to leave that easily.

1028
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,040
[Khloé] Rob has always been
my best friend.

1029
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,776
Even though the world might have been

1030
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,912
removed from Rob for the past few years,

1031
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,013
I never have been.

1032
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,017
I've always been by Rob's side
and loyal to a fault,

1033
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:17,321
so I never imagined, out of any sibling,

1034
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,789
that he would be able to cut me off

1035
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,890
the way that he has.

1036
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,893
You're… you're more emotionally stable.

1037
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,395
Why don't you be the bigger person?

1038
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,300
[upbeat music]

1039
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,942
[Khloé] Try to call Rob.

1040
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,348
Perfect. No answer. What else is new?

1041
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,084
Oh, that's cute.

1042
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,320
Little gray house.

1043
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,523
{\an8}Oh, my god, it's so cute here.

1044
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,732
Looks cute.

1045
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,834
[knocking]

1046
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,103
That plant is dead.

1047
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,339
Hi, Juanita!

1048
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,507
Is Robert here?

1049
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,741
-No.
-Oh, he's not here?

1050
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,243
-No.
-Okay.

1051
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,345
Well, thank you.
I was just gonna say "hi."

1052
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,414
[laughs]
Thank you.

1053
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,917
Oh, well. I tried.

1054
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,820
[line ringing]

1055
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:23,988
[Malika] <i>Hello?</i>

1056
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:27,091
{\an8}Are you sleeping at 2:30 in the afternoon?

1057
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,594
[Malika] <i>Yeah, 'cause I woke up
at 4:30 this morning</i>

1058
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:31,996
<i>to get my hair done.</i>

1059
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,431
-Well…
-[Malika] <i>What?</i>

1060
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,732
I know you told me

1061
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,734
that I should try to make
the first move with Rob

1062
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,236
because you know he won't. So…

1063
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,605
I called him, of course,
he doesn't answer.

1064
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,908
But I drove by his new house,
just to go pop up

1065
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,543
and, like, say "hi" and, like, whatever,

1066
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,078
and he wasn't home or I don't know what.

1067
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,047
[Malika] <i>Just keep trying.</i>

1068
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,752
Yeah. Just keeping trying.

1069
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,454
[Khloé] You know, I'm a little

1070
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,255
frustrated about this whole situation

1071
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,324
'cause I feel like this is
just getting dragged out

1072
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,859
way longer than it needs to.

1073
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,929
[Khloé] I decide
to just be the bigger person,

1074
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,264
{\an8}and I don't really see the effort

1075
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,766
{\an8}he's making on his end.

1076
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,635
So I'm not really sure
what else to do, as of now.

1077
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,971
[Malika] <i>Well, I'm proud of you.</i>

1078
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,240
Well, I love you. Thank you.
Just had to vent.

1079
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,645
[Kim] <i>Coming up next week…</i>

1080
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,414
My mom is insane.

1081
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,182
My entire room is cleared out.

1082
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,953
It really annoys me
that you guys come to the city

1083
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,321
and don't hang out with me.

1084
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,756
-We, like, forget.
-[Kendall] I do love my career,

1085
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,859
but I feel like I'm missing out
on certain things at home.

1086
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,728
I don't wanna be forgotten
just 'cause I work a lot.

1087
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,930
Rob went on his Instagram,

1088
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,699
making fun of the food that I bought.

1089
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:44,335
There is no way I'm gonna
let my brother disrespect her.

1090
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:47,204
You're blasting Mom
and it's petty as [bleep].
