00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,605
{\an8}You know how we go on a family trip

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,040
{\an8}-once or twice a year?
-[Sheila] Mm-hm.

3
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,975
{\an8}So, I'm thinking Vail.

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,143
{\an8}Vail.

00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,479
{\an8}[Kris]
<i>I am so excited to surprise the kids.</i>

6
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,948
{\an8}It's just the perfect place
to take the family.

7
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,984
{\an8}[Kourtney] Scott's asking if he can come.

8
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,285
{\an8}I think Scott should come.

9
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,222
{\an8}I feel like it's a good opportunity to see

10
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,824
{\an8}if he can handle
coming on family vacations.

11
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,560
{\an8}You just need to keep it together, dude.

12
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,195
{\an8}[Scott]
<i>Well, you got yourself a deal, kid.</i>

13
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,398
{\an8}[Kris] <i>Welcome to Vail.</i>

14

{\an8}[Khloé] <i>Oh, my god, guys.</i>

15
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,467
{\an8}[Todd] Look at this, baby Rob.

16
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,169
{\an8}[Kim] I can't believe Rob isn't here.

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,904
{\an8}[Khloé] Rob is just a pussy.

18
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,306
{\an8}He proposed in front of her whole family.

19
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,376
{\an8}We wake up to my brother
just getting engaged.

20
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,011
{\an8}[Khloé] He hasn't told us anything.

21
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,746
{\an8}That's so [bleep] up that he did that.

22
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,918
{\an8}[upbeat music]

23
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,858
[Kris] Morning. Hi.

24
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,227
-These are so cute.
-[Sheila] So cute.

25

00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,069
Okay, let me see what's going on here.

28
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,870
See the drama.

29
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,405
[Sheila] Huh?

30
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:13,973
You all right?

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,510
I guess Rob got engaged last night.

32
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,711
-What?
-Yeah.

33
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,081

00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,049
[sighs]

35
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,218
I'll tell you, never a dull moment.
How are you?

36
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,486
I mean, are you all right?

37
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,089
[Kris]
No, but that's why we're just wandering.

38
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,293
I wake up to a gazillion text messages,

39
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,028
which is never good news,

40
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,696
and I'm reading through them

41
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,233
<i>and realize Rob got engaged last night.</i>

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,901
He got engaged.

43
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,637
<i>And it's sort of coming out of left field.</i>

44
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,073
Like I… I think I'm just in shock.

45
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,976
[Sheila] How did he tell you?

46
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,544
-Like what…
-[Kris] He didn't.

47
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,480
It was just all over the Internet.

48
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,516
-[Sheila] Oh, I'm sorry.
-It's wild.

49
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,718
-[Sheila] No, it's not right.
-[Kris] He asked for her mom's

50
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,753
hand in marriage
and I'm like, we don't even…

51
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,255
he's never even mentioned it to us.

52
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,058
-[Sheila] You gonna call him?
-[Kris] No. Mm-mm.

53
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,459
I'm not gonna call him.

54
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,829
I don't… I mean,
he should've called me and said--

55
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,030
I understand.

56
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,702
[Kris] I didn't do anything to him
except give him an amazing life.

57
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,337
[pensive music]

58
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,405

Put one foot in front of the other.

00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,008
-Take each day one at a time.
-[Kris] Yeah.

00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:27,080
[Kris] <i>To hear that Rob got engaged
through social media</i>

62
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,983
is a bit disappointing, to say the least.

63
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,819
<i>He should've told me first,</i>

64
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,988
<i>or even talked to the family about it,</i>

65
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,956
or mentioned it to his sisters.

66
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,692
But I had no idea.

-Yeah.

-Good, babe.

about his skiing

this whole situation with Rob.

-I am. So excited.

93
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,538
[Tyga] I have on tennis shoes.

I'm already tired.
[giggles]

96
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,612
We have not been to Vail in so many years,

97
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,580
and this trip is super important to us,

98
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,516
so just because we got
a little bit of this negative news,

99
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,018
I don't want it ruining our trip.

100
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,021
So, we are going to ignore

101
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,857
and go skiing
and enjoy the rest of our trip.

102
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,060

00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,604
Everyone's calling us, like, our friends,
like, asking if it's true,

172
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,273
and they want to congratulate Rob,

173
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,642
and it's kind of embarrassing
for us to not know.

174
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,744
[Kim]
<i>Like, of course, do whatever you want,</i>

175
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,145
like, do what makes you happy.

176
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,581
I got married once
and didn't tell my whole family.

177
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:33,186
But I don't know,
it just seems so not like him.

178
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,088
[Kim] Kourt, that was Roxy,
and she basically said that…

179
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,891
Rob said he's loving his life…

180
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,527
[Khloé] He was the same with Adrienne,
the same with Rita.

181
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,963
[Tyga] What are you gonna do?
Nothing you can do.

182
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,967
The best thing is to sit back
and just let them be.

183
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:48,968
Yeah.

184
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,570
Like, everything you're going through,

185
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,339
like, I've been through worse
with her, you know?

186
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,341
Tyga did have a relationship with Chyna,

187
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,245
so I appreciate his perspective
on the situation,

188
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,948
but he also has to understand
where we're coming from as well.

189
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:05,518
Rob, even after the fact,
hasn't said anything to us.

190
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,920
[Kim] I would literally never post
a photo with you,

191
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,756
just to like, not hurt her feelings
because, like, obviously,

192
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,559
that did hurt her feelings,
you know, that, like…

193
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,828
my little sister is, like,

194
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,898
you know, with her baby dad.
Like, I'm very, like…

195
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,335
Like, I understand it,
how she could've been hurt,

196
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,970
like, totally, like, I'm never…

197
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,339
[Tyga] But it also has nothing to do
with you though, you know?

198
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,406
-It's like…
-Totally.

199
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,509
[Tyga]
That's life, you know what I mean? Like…

200
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,143
People have to find out for themselves

201
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,212
-and go their own way, you know?
-[Kim] Totally.

202
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,048
She's not a bad person,
you know what I mean?

203
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,617
She's not a bad person at all.

204
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,785
When she posted something about Kylie,

205
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,356
I went so crazy on my brother
because I was, like,

206
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,558
"The way we…" And I know
everything was on speaker.

207
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,393
I was like, "The way we were raised,

208
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,362
that is now your girlfriend."

209
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,465
[Tyga] Okay, it's, like, if he was, like,
not posting anything from jump,

210
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,034
like, about Kylie, or, like,
not doing none of this stuff,

211
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,369
you were only doing it

212
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,004
because you was just trying to,
like, get at me.

213
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,338
And just be in the mix all day.

214
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,641
It's not funny, you know what I'm saying?

215
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,412
It's just the overall one-up factor.
It's like, "Yo, I won."

216
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,115
Why was he able to propose
in front of her whole family,

217
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,350
-but he can't include us?
-I don't know.

218
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,386
[tense music]

219
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,557
[Khloé] <i>I feel like
Rob is deliberately excluding us</i>

220
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,058
from so many things.

221
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,994
And he almost, like, likes this wedge

222
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,196
that's being put between us all,

223
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,566
<i>which is bizarre to me,
'cause we didn't grow up that way.</i>

224
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,100
<i>But whenever Rob needs something,</i>

225
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,069
<i>he'll come back crawling.</i>

226
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,872
Rob is full of bull [bleep].
And I can't handle it.

227
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,944
[dramatic music]

228
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,546
You were only doing it

229
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,582
because you was just trying to,
like, get at me

230
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,916
and just be in the mix all day.

231
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,685
It's not funny, you know what I'm saying?

232
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,153
-It's the overall…
-Package.

233
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,655
…one-up factor. It's like, "Yo, I won."

234
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,258
-[Kylie] Yeah.
-'Cause in her mind, like--

235
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,393
This is your sister you're talking about.

236
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,895
Have some respect.

237
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,263
Should I call her?

238
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,864
-[Tyga] No, you shouldn't call her.
-[Kourtney] Why?

239
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,133
Because… You should, Kim should call her.

240
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,835
[Kourtney] She knows I'm the rational one.

241
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,371
Kim, you're the only person
that can patch all this stuff up,

242
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,440
and you know it. You're gonna have to.

243
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,608
Would you go to the wedding?

244
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,643
[pensive music]

245
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,446
-[Tyga] You have to, right?
-[Kylie] Would you go to the wedding?

246
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,815
-[Kim] Look, guys…
-Mom has to.

247
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,817
[pensive music continues]

248
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,186
We're not going to his wedding
if he has a wedding.

249
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,288
[Kourtney] But I mean, how many weddings
have we been to in this family

250
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,656
and they don't mean [bleep]?

251
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,225
So, let's all get over it.

252
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,997
[upbeat music]

253
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,368
-[Scott] Let's go.
-[Khloé] Let's see you [bleep] like us.

254
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,902
[Corey] Which way we going?

255
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,070
All right.

256
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,306
{\an8}[Khloé] Oh, yeah.

257
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,975
[Corey] Whoa.
[chuckles]

258
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,378
{\an8}[upbeat music]

259
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,379
[Corey] Whoa.

260
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,680
[Khloé] So good.

261
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,216
[Corey] Whoa.

262
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,119
[Kourtney]
Watching Corey gives me a heart attack.

263
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,987
-[Scott] I know, it's scary.
-[all laugh]

264
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,455
{\an8}[Corey grunts]

265
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,393
[all laugh]

266
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:01,994
[Corey] I'm okay.

267
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,497
-[Kourtney] Who wiped out?
-[Corey] Now I feel safe.

268
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,433
I'm feeling good. I was going too fast.

269
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,901
[Kourtney] You needed to stop?

270
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,404
I think I'm just beat at this point.

271
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,441
[Corey panting]

272
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,376
[Corey]
All right, I got to pull it together.

273
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,279
I got to get my Scott [bleep] together.

274
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,681
You know, Scott's just too cool.

275
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,983
Look how he stands. He just stands like…

276
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,618
He don't look like he even working.

277
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,621
[Scott] If you jerk off a little
in the middle, it really helps out.

278
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,723
[Kourtney] Coming through, Khlo.

279
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,392
Open it up, open it up, open it up. Oh.

280
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,127
-[Kim] I'm coming.
-[Khloé shrieks]

281
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,031
-Yeah.
-[all cheering]

282
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,400
[upbeat music]

283
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,407
[Kendall] Wait, you guys,
it doesn't just take like that.

284
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,743
-You have to, like, wait for me to focus.
-[Scott] What do you mean?

285
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,144
Okay, do it.

286
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,345
-[Kendall] Oh.
-[camera shutter clicks]

287
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,413
. [Kendall laughs]

288
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,049
-[Kendall] He's really modeling.
-[Tyga speaks indistinctly]

289
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,584
[girl] Kendall.

290
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,152
[Scott in girly voice]
Kendall.

291
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,554
Let's put it out there.

292
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,822
-[laughs]
-[Scott] Let me see--

293
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,257
So all you have to do is
focus with this big one.

294
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,625
-[Scott] Focus…
-On me.

295
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,526
[girl] Kendall.

296
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,494
[Scott]
Well, you got to get, like, a better view.

297
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,995
-Go, like, by the door.
-[Kendall] Okay.

298
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,197
Just go outside.
[chuckles]

299
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,133
-[Kendall] Who-- Where are they?
-They're, like, right down there.

300
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,270
-[Kendall] No, Scott.
-[Scott] Here's Kendall.

301
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,438
[girl 1] Kendall.

302
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,040
[Scott]
Here's who you've been waiting for.

303
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,810
-[girl 2] Oh, my god.
-[Scott] Here's Kenny. Here's Kendall.

304
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,847
-[girl 1] Kendall.
-[Scott] Say hi. Tyga performs in 20.

305
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,749
-[girl 2] Tyga.
-[girl 3] I love you.

306
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,650
-[laughs]
-[girl 3] I love you.

307
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,220
-[girl 1] Come down and perform.
-[girl 2] Tyga.

308
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,855
-Tyga.
-[girl 3] I love you.

309
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,157
I can't believe you're really performing
in 20 minutes.

310
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,825
-That's what I'm not doing.
-[chuckles]

311
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,527
[Scott] Yo, tell them to flash us.

312
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,295
Are they old enough?

313
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,331
How old are you guys? Flash us.

314
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,432
[girls laugh]

315
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,134
[laughs]

316
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,035
{\an8}[girl 1] Tyga.

317
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,470
{\an8}-[Scott laughs]
-[girl 2] I love you.

318
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,074
Adventure Ridge.

319
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,409
See, those are the names of all the runs.

320
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,512
-Oh, okay.
-Oh, okay.

321
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,514
-[Kris] Hi.
-[Corey] Watch your step.

322
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,716
[Kris] This is nice.

323
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,385
I haven't been up here in so long.

324
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,220
It's so pretty.

325
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,957
I've set up an amazing dinner
on top of the mountain

326
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,527
<i>at the most beautiful restaurant.</i>

327
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,429
I wanna take the family up
and enjoy the sunset.

328
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,398
[Kris] Here we are.

329
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,133
[Sheila] Oh, we're here.

330
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,636
-Wow.
-[Kris] It's so good.

331
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,570
[Sheila] Thank you.

332
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,305
Look at the sun setting.

333
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,107
-[Sheila] Wow.
-[Randy] Are you serious?

334
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,809
[Sheila]
Look at this. You're on top of the world.

335
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,510
Wow.

336
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,045
[Kris] It's stunning.

337
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,914
[Sheila] Look at that sunset.

338
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,015
Honest to God.

339
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,885
-We love you guys.
-[Corey] Love you too.

340
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,520
-[Kris] Love you.
-To the best trip.

341
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,988
And good night.

342
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,025
[phone chiming]

343
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,162
[Kris] You've got to be kidding me.

344
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,431
"Hi, Kris.

345
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,669
I saw that Rob and Angela, aka Chyna,

346
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,370
got engaged and I was wondering

347
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,941
if you can forward my e-mail below
over to Rob for consideration.

348
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,244
As you already know,
I'm the best wedding videographer

349
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,146
-in Northern California."
-[Randy] No.

350
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,149
"I just thought
I would reach out first, thanks."

351
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,483
That's crazy.

352
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,586
[Kris] Oh, my god.

353
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:18,057
[waiter] So are we waiting for
a few others to show up for dinner?

354
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,593
[Kris]
That's the 10-million-dollar question.

355
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,161
[line ringing]

356
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,763
{\an8}-[Kim] <i>Hi.</i>
-[Kris] Hi.

357
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,298
[Kim]
<i>I'm throwing everyone else under the bus.</i>

358
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,933
<i>No one else is on their way.</i>

359
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,268
[somber music]

360
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,037
<i>I'm dressed and ready to go.
I was totally on my way.</i>

361
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,740
<i>And I just think by the time
we get there, it's so dark already…</i>

362
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,110
Okay, well, until we start doing
these family vacations,

363
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,247
so it's really a family vacation,

364
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,848
then I'm not doing this anymore.

365
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,583
[Kim] <i>I swear, I was literally on my way.</i>

366
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,785
<i>We all should've done it together.</i>

367
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,755
<i>I love you and I promise
I'll make it up to you. I swear.</i>

368
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,925
I've gone to so much trouble,

369
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,895
<i>and if my kids don't give a [bleep],</i>

370
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,830
then I don't give a [bleep].

371
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,865
I don't care anymore.

372
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,533
[Kris] They're just idiots.

373
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,339
[upbeat music]

374
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,443
-[woman] Hey.
<i>-Opa. Opa.</i>

375
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,511
[Scott] Work it.

376
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,746
[indistinct chatter]

377
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,015
[Scott]
Do we actually wanna go bowling or no?

378
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,049
Yeah, why not?

379
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,085
-[Khloé] Oh, hey.
-[Kendall] Care to join us?

380
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,421
-I can. Where is…
-[Khloé] Fancy Nancy strikes again.

381
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,891
-[Kourtney] Are you not going to Mom's?
-No, I felt so guilty.

382
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,394
[Kourtney]
Why didn't you go meet with Mom?

383
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,162
Because it was gonna be too dark

384
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,932
-and this sounded better, to be honest.
-[Tyga] What?

385
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,968
[Kim] <i>My mom planned this big dinner
at the top of a mountain.</i>

386
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,971
And truly, I woke up
this morning, worked out,

387
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,139
then went skiing,

388
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,907
then, you know, took my daughter skiing,

389
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:42,942
so I've had a full day.

390
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,444
<i>So we decided to just eat
at the restaurant</i>

391
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,779
<i>that's right inside of the hotel.</i>

392
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:47,913
<i>It's just easier.</i>

393
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,449
<i>She's also there with her friends,
so I don't think she would mind.</i>

394
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,484
Like, I don't know
why she's so disappointed.

395
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,820
[Kourtney] Should one of us call Rob?

396
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,857
I don't want to call our brother.

397
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,894
[Kourtney]
That's how you're feeling, but guess what?

398
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,629
How many are there of us?

399
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,266
You feel like
you don't want to talk to him.

400
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,834
-Good for you.
-You feel like you wanna talk to him?

401
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,836
[Kourtney] I feel like I'd like to--

402
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,672
Actually, I really,
really don't even care.

403
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,974
So, at a normal…

404
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,443
[Kylie] How the [bleep] are you gonna say
you don't even care?

405
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,378
[Tyga] She's gonna carry on the legacy.

406
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,813
If she has a boy?

407
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,948
I could change my kids' last name.

408
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,683
What the [bleep].

409
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,819
I'm sitting right here, you sick [bleep].

410
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:27,820
[Kourtney laughs]

411
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,522
[Tyga] Wait, all, all your guys' kids'
last name is Disick, right?

412
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,558
This bitch just said,
"I'm gonna try to change 'em."

413
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,259
No, I said I could

414
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,061
-change my kids' last name.
-[Scott] You could?

415
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,696
What the [bleep] is wrong with you?

416
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,532
So that she couldn't have the last name.

417
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,501
It's a joke.

418
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,503
[Todd] I remember you guys saying,

419
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,372
you know what,
we're gonna try snowboarding,

420
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:49,942
{\an8}and then Kourtney decided to fall,
and what happened?

421
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,810
-[Kourtney] Break my arm.
-You broke your arm.

422
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:55,314
[Kourtney] Within, like,
the first five minutes of snowboarding.

423
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,949
-Full cast?
-[Kourtney] Yeah, full cast.

424
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,951
-Yeah, I did.
-[Khloé] No, that's not a real story.

425
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,652
-[Scott] No. She swears it's real.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

426
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,321
Ask Kim if that's real.

427
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,323
[Scott] Kim, is that really true?

428
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,791
Kourtney actually says that she fell.

429
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,359
[Kourtney] That I had a full cast.

430
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,527
We thought that…

431
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,428
[Scott] Right. Okay, thank you.

432
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,063
-I rest my case.
-[Kourtney] We did.

433
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,166
[Kim] I don't know if it's true.
It was like 30 years ago.

434
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,035
[all laugh]

435
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,637
I know Kourt had a ton of anxiety

436
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,273
in regards to Scott coming on this trip,

437
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,175
which I totally understand,

438
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,411
but the more that we're on this trip,

439
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,280
<i>and Scott is really proving himself,</i>

440
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,416
I could just see
that her guards are getting let down,

441
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,117
and Kourtney's now having more fun,

442
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,586
and I could see those nerves
are completely leaving her.

443
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,856
Who the [bleep] are you waving at?

444
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,858
-[Kourtney] Those kids.
-[Scott] They didn't wave at you.

445
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,927
-[Kourtney] Yeah, they were.
-No, they weren't.

446
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,862
[Scott] Now they realize who you are.

447
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,230
-[Kourtney] Good.
-Are you insane?

448
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,799
-No.
-Those kids didn't wave at you.

449
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,567
-They were waving at us.
-No, they didn't.

450
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:49,668
-Yeah, they were.
-I'm gonna ask them.

451
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,470
[Tyga] Let's cheers.

452
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,806
-[Kendall and Khloé] To what?
-[Tyga] To, um…

453
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,509
just cheers to being blessed, having a…

454
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,078
-a great family.
-[Khloé] "Being blessed

455
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,813
-and having a great family."
-Yeah.

456
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,481
And you guys really don't realize that,

457
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,349
I'm on the outside looking in, but, like,

458
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,485
you guys have a really solid family.

459
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,755
-The family value is so strong, you know?
-Yeah.

460
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,723
[Tyga] Like, it's just a great thing.

461
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,192
Not a lot of people have
families like that,

462
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,527
-you know, so, like…
-[Khloé] Cheers to family.

463
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,062
Toast to Kris Jenner.

464
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,897
[Kourtney]
Toast to Kris Jenner for setting up

465
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,166
-this secret trip for us.
-[Khloé] Yes.

466
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,535
[Kendall] Even though she's not here,
she can feel it.

467
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,704
And just, like, doing this for all of us.

468
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,906
-[bleep]
-[Khloé] Doing the damn thing.

469
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,108
[Kourtney] Doing the damn thing.

470
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,909
[Khloé chuckles]
Yeah.

471
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,779
[upbeat music]

472
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,153
Wait, this is, like,
the nicest bowling alley I've ever seen.

473
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,288
Back here?

474
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,357
[Khloé] Mother[bleep].

475
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,558
How do you…

476
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,760
[Scott] Where's the pin master? Who's up?

477
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,429
[Khloé] Come on, Kim. I believe in you.

478
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,132
[upbeat music]

479
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,500
{\an8}-[all cheering]
-Yeah, Kim.

480
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,436
[Khloé] What?

481
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,204
-There you go.
-[Kourtney] Can I do it?

482
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,039
[Khloé] Yeah.
[laughs]

483
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,708
Oh, yeah, Ye.

484
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,477
[all laughing, yelling]

485
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,379
[Khloé] I told you. It's rigged.

486
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,214
All right.

487
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,950
-Whoa.
-Oh, oh.

488
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,186
[Khloé] Oh, yeah.

489
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,988
-Whoo!
-Yeah.

490
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,222
[Scott] I got a strike.

491
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,323
[Khloé] Oh, you did?

492
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,825
I didn't even get to see you get a strike.

493
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,793
This is [bleep] bull [bleep].

494
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,061
[Khloé] No. Yeah.

495
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,664
This girl's twerking all over town now.

496
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,666
I'm over here striking 'em out.

497
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,901
[Khloé] Ow.

498
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,869
-Did it work?
-Yeah.

499
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,005
-[Khloé on recording] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
-[Scott on recording] <i>Oh, come on.</i>

500
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,306
[Khloé] Who's winning?

501
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,675
-[Kendall] Ye.
-[Khloé] Pablo? Pablo.

502
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,876
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo.

503
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,578
-[Khloé] How are you on the trip?
-[Scott] Good.

504
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,047
Especially now that your boobs are
directly in my face.

505
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,016
"Let me ask you, how are you feeling?"

506
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,285
{\an8}[Khloé] Do you get uncomfortable
that we're all drinking?

507
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,420
{\an8}[Scott]
Nah. I don't care about that [bleep].

508
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,655
Like, is it rude?

509
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,023
No.

510
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,158
I, I would think it would be weird
if people didn't.

511
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,360
[Scott] I don't not drink, but…

512
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,596
I know, but not around Kourt, right?

513
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,730
Yeah.

514
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,732
-[Khloé] Why, 'cause there's too much…
-[Scott] No, I just told her I wouldn't.

515
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,068
-Oh, right, but she knows you do.
-Yeah.

516
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,036
[Khloé] Hmm.

517
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,003
[Scott] I don't lie to her
about anything anymore.

518
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,338
-[Khloé] Good.
-[Scott] Ever.

519
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,473
Even if she asks me,
like, the weirdest [bleep].

520
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,841
Hmm, easier that way,

521
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,210
-you don't have to remember.
-Ah, never.

522
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,111
[Khloé] Does it bother you
that she drinks now?

523
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,680
[Scott] No, [bleep] it,
I always want her to lighten up.

524
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,082
[Khloé] Yeah, but just, like,
is it awkward ever?

525
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,116
[Scott] I mean, of course.

526
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,085
But I can't imagine you not being here.

527
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,386
[Scott] Yeah, no, I mean, listen,

528
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,389
it's been, like, amazing
to be able to be around everybody,

529
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,424
and the kids, especially.

530
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,326
[pensive music]

531
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,261
[Scott] <i>One of the biggest issues</i>

532
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,896
between Kourtney and I for a long time

533
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,699
was me drinking, and a lot of times,

534
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,468
<i>I think I get overly emotional
when I drink,</i>

535
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,004
<i>and that's a lot of the times
when Kourtney and I would fight.</i>

536
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,041
And I told her, on this trip,
I just wouldn't drink.

537
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,078
<i>I just want her to see
that I can keep it together.</i>

538
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,947
{\an8}-[Kourtney] Scott?
-Huh?

539
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,749
-[Kourtney] Avocado?
-[Scott] Oh, thanks.

540
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,318
Oh, she made you a plate. Oh, wow, ho…

541
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,920
Amazing, you talk to me for two minutes,

542
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,288
-she makes me a plate.
-[Khloé laughs]

543
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,556
-[Khloé] She made you food.
-[Scott] It's unbelievable.

544
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,124
[Khloé] Get another one, Pab.

545
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,760
-[Scott] Oh. Shoot.
-[Khloé] Oh!

546
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,596
[all cheering]

547
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,966
[upbeat music]

548
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,971
{\an8}-[Khloé] Scott.
-[Scott] Huh?

549
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,906
-Hey.
-[Scott] Holy [bleep].

550
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,375
You, like, have a glam room on a ski trip.

551
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,143
Don't you guys feel like
this is gonna, like,

552
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,078
{\an8}-kind of make you look a little insane?
-We are insane.

553
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:21,980
Ooh, "Rob Kardashian,

554
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,449
'My family didn't know
jack about my engagement.'"

555
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,184
[tense music]

556
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,854
[Kim]
This is on <i>TMZ,</i> so it's all of our faces.

557
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,022
-[phone chimes]
-And it says,

558
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,190
"Rob Kardashian blindsided his family

559
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,027
not giving them the heads up
or even a hint about his engagement.

560
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,828
Sources familiar with the situation

561
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,764
tell us Rob went to great lengths

562
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,799
to keep Kim and company in the dark.

563
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:44,803
The women are not taking kindly
to being squeezed out.

564
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,571
And as reported, none of the women jumped

565
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,473
on social media to congratulate him."

566
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,343
-Why would we congratulate him?
-[phone chimes]

567
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,946
And no one should congratulate them.

568
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,116
That's so desperate
and fake of whoever does first

569
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,251
'cause I know someone's gonna break.

570
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,787
[Kylie] Tyga tweeted something.

571
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,723
-[Khloé] Saying what?
-[Kylie] He said,

572
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,724
"Everyone deserves to be happy.

573
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,193
What someone does for their happiness
is not my concern

574
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,696
as long as it's not interfering
with my happiness."

575
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,799
All the comments are like,
"Don't care anymore."

576
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,600
They're not bashing him anymore.
They're just like,

577
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,769
"Oh, okay, he doesn't care?
Good, we don't care."

578
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,872
People are trying to make it
this big feud and it's just…

579
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,208
it is what it is. Like, we just want Rob
to be happy.

580
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,779
I just feel like the world thinks
that we care so much

581
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,215
and they're making it this huge,
big deal, when in reality,

582
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,017
<i>none of us really care.</i>

583
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,152
<i>We just want Rob to be able to tell us</i>

584
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,822
when he's gonna do
something so big like this.

585
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,058
[Kylie] If people know
that we actually don't care…

586
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,960
[Khloé] As soon as no one cares
about them, it's gonna fizzle out.

587
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,362
[chuckles]

588
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,597
-God.
-[Kylie] No matter what we do,

589
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:46,732
we can't control what…

590
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,433
what's gonna happen between them.

591
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,071
I know that Kylie feels like
silence sometimes can, you know,

592
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,673
drag it on longer, and I agree.

593
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,675
<i>Part of me wants to address this.</i>

594
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:57,909
But then, on the other hand, like,

595
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,711
I do wanna talk to my brother first.

596
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,314
<i>But at this point,
I don't really know what to do.</i>

597
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,984
At the end of the day, it's his life, and…

598
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:06,985
[Khloé] His problem.

599
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,087
[tense music]

600
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,658
[upbeat music]

601
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,799
[Kendall] Where's Kylie?

602
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,102
We're so late, let's go.

603
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,370
[Kendall] <i>As much fun as I'm having,</i>

604
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,440
I have to get home
because I have a trip for work.

605
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,009
And I know Tyga's getting on a plane
'cause he has to go on tour.

606
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,744
So I'm just gonna hop
on the plane with him

607
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,246
<i>and Kylie to prepare for that.</i>

608
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,214
[Kendall] Bye, guys, love you.

609
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,517
[light music]

610
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,154
Bye, Mom, I love you. Bye.

611
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,026
[electronic music]

612
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,669
-Khloé?
-Yeah.

613
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,539
One time, we were on this, um, houseboat.

614
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,809
-Oh, jeez.
-And your dad went,

615
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,710
-went jet skiing.
-Yeah.

616
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,346
But he, like, two hours later,
never came back.

617
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,783
-Oh, god, I remember that.
-And we all could not find him.

618
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,653
And I was, like,
three, four months pregnant.

619
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,588
-That's so scary.
-[Kris] Yeah, it was scary.

620
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,190
And they were trying to calm me down,

621
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,325
and I'm like, "You guys don't understand,

622
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,461
my baby's not gonna have a dad."

623
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,629
-Oh, baby.
-I was like, "Oh, my god."

624
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,998
God, I wonder where Kylie gets
her dramatics from.

625
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,333
Oh.

626
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,235
I wonder where you get
your dramatics from.

627
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,671
I was thinking the exact same thing,
but I was…

628
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,340
-You were on the other boat barking.
-I was gonna keep my mouth shut.

629
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,441
[laughs]

630
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,877

[background chatter]

632
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,022
Kourt, did you get the video I sent you,

633
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,190
-of, uh…
-[Kourtney] Mase?

634
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,859
-Yeah. Cute, huh?
-Yeah.

635
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,994
[Khloé]
You two are sitting next to each other?

636
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,162
[Khloé] [bleep] getting real.

637
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,129
[Scott] Oh, yeah.

638
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,764
-[Kourtney] Hey, Mom.
-Hi.

639
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,665
-[Kourtney] Is she sleeping?
-Yeah.

640
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,133
-Hi.
-Hi.

641
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,971
Since we, uh, missed
the dinner the other night,

642
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,606
when you wanted us to all come out,

643
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,140
I just want to say that,

644
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,509
you know, we're really sorry.

645
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,410
[light music]

646
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,347
It's something to really appreciate
having this,

647
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,582
like, big family and a big support system.

648
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,217
Sometimes we take it for granted.

649
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,855
And I know my mom planned this dinner,
and she's probably so upset about Rob,

650
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,524
and I feel like we should have gone,

651
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,159
and I feel really guilty
'cause we should just like be there

652
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,562
and be this, like,
emotional support for her

653
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,463
and have a good time.

654
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,198
[Kim] This has been such a fun trip.

655
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,432
Don't you guys think?

656
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,867
-[Kris] Yeah.
-So fun.

657
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,135
-[Randy] Yeah, super fun.
-[Khloé] The best.

658
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,738
Guys, let's have a toast.
Let's have a toast…

659
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,773
[Randy]
Toast to the hostess with the mostest.

660
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,241
-Cheers.
-[Kanye] Cheers.

661
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,543
[Khloé] North…

662
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,611
I wish I was you right now.

663
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,914
Aw, she's snoring.

664
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,016
[Khloé] She is snoring.

665
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,451
[light music]

666
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,088
I'm gonna put ice on your brother's booty,
I hope you know.

667
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,290
[Penelope] Why?

668
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,225
Because your brother put ice
down my boobies.

669
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,062
-[Khloé] You good?
-[Penelope] I'm gonna put something on.

670
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,297
[Khloé] What?

671
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,699
Ooh.

672
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:08,900
That was delicious.

673
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,669
Oh, so good.

674
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,804
It was worth it. I had a burger…

675
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,806
[Khloé] Oh, come here, Mase.
I got to tell you something.

676
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,443
Why does everybody
call sisters now sisters?

677
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,611
[Kris] 'Cause they, they do it?

678
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,546
-[Khloé] Hey, come here--
-Well, if you're in Sydney,

679
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,915
-it's sister this, sister that.
-[Khloé] Mason, come here.

680
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,318
-Let me throw a snowball at you.
-[Mason speaks indistinctly]

681
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,753
-[Khloé] Yeah.
-Oh.

682
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,889
[Khloé] Don't you dare.

683
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,224
-Don't you… Oh!
-Oh, jeez.

684
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,192
[Scott laughs]

685
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,962
[Khloé]
Where are you going? Where are you going?

686
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,163
Oh.

687
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,264
I wanna eat it so bad.

688
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,832
-[Mason] Eat it.
-[Khloé] No.

689
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,101
[quirky music]

690
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,469
Oh.

691
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,637
[grunts]

692
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,207
-[Kourtney] Wait, hold on.
-[Kris] You get this.

693
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,610
And then I'll jump in and we'll get it.

694
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,612
Here, here, here.

695
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,216
Perfect. One, two, three.

696
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,520
[electronic music]

697
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,292
[Kourtney] There's nothing like
walking through, like, a small town.

698
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,027
I think you're right.

699
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,063
[Kourtney] All right, Gorsuch it up.

700
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,567
[Kim]
Look at how cute these are, seriously.

701
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,503
-These flame pants?
-Yeah, and these?

702
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,806
Oh, not the… not the rhinestones.

703
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,477
They are cute if we were snowboarders.

704
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,079
[Kim] Were you so nervous
for Scott to come?

705
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,048
Like, I've been telling everyone I'm…

706
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,950
Like, Scott was amazing on this trip.

707
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,420
Yeah, I'm, like, really glad
I let him come

708
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,522
'cause I feel like
it's all about, like, the memories

709
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,791
and, like, for the kids
to, like, have him here.

710
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,092
[Kim] Totally.

711
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,028
And I feel like he's been…

712
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,963
-[Kim] He's been so good.
-…so good.

713
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,097
[Kim] Yeah.

714
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,999
And he's been totally fine.

715
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,068
Yeah, I know, he's been, like, amazing.

716
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,103
-Yeah.
-I was, like, so proud.

717
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,606
[Kourtney]
Yeah, I'm glad that he could be here.

718
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,511
It was a great decision
having Scott come on the trip.

719
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:03,148
And I think it's great for him
to know that…

720
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,718
he is always going to be
a part of our family.

721
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,388
Oh, this is so cute.

722
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,157
Do you like this on me or no?

723
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,291
[Kourtney] No.

724
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,527
Oh, well, that took care of that.

725
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,362
[Kourtney] Mom, you don't even ski.

726
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,963
[Kris] Oh, right. You're right.

727
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,132
[both laugh]

728
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,834
[Kris] Okay.

729
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,703
[upbeat music]

730
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,242
[Kim] I just heard
that you canceled <i>Kocktails.</i>

731
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,544
How do you feel?

732
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,480
Well, I was just pissed about the show.
It wasn't my vision anymore.

733
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,648
I don't think you should stop it.

734
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,417
Like, I'm a person
that's really particular about production

735
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,252
and the table has to be like this.

736
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,355
But when I was at Adidas,
when we were gonna do the first shoe,

737
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,324
I didn't wanna put it out.
I didn't like the shoe.

738
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,726
But I worked through it,

739
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,795
made the 350, and now I have,
like, better opportunities.

740
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,598
Like, I always wanted
to do <i>Kocktails</i> on my app.

741
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,233
-But can you call it <i>Kocktails with Khloé</i>?
-But don't stop.

742
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,035
Oh, I'm not gonna call it <i>Kocktails</i>.

743
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,136
[Kanye] <i>Dicktails with Khloé.</i>

744
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,505
Seriously. <i>Tails from the [bleep].</i>

745
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,208
<i>-[bleep] and Roll.</i>
-[Khloé] <i>[bleep] and Roll.</i>

746
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,442
[phone chimes]

747
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,847
Rob just wrote me, by the way,
and said, "Call me when you're alone."

748
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,014
[tense music]

749
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,750
-Rob?
-Yeah.

750
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,051
I didn't respond.

751
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,220
[Khloé] There's no loyalty
or family unity with him.

752
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,655
-It's bizarre.
-He's just… That's his personality.

753
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:22,227
[Khloé] <i>I hate that other people know more
about our family than we know.</i>

754
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,262
As long as we know,
we could be a united front,

755
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,631
but if we don't know,
then there's cracks in the foundation,

756
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,566
and everything's gonna go to [bleep].

757
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,335
Caitlyn did it and now Rob's doing it.

758
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,338
He's the weak link in the bunch,
and he needs to be cut.

759
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:34,739
Let's get a new link.

760
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,175
[tense music]

761
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,477
There's no loyalty
or family unity with him.

762
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,645
-It's bizarre.
-He's just…

763
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,780
That's his personality.

764
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,716
He's the weak link in the bunch,
and he needs to be cut.

765
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,084
Let's get a new link.

766
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,787
The mom whole animosity is at you two.

767
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,589
And that's what I don't, I don't like.

768
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:55,160
Did you see what she just wrote
about all of us

769
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,928
and how we weren't invited to the wedding?

770
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,129
[Khloé] Why does she even comment?

771
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,898
Both me and Kim have been in situations

772
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,433
where we were with someone
that all of our friends hated.

773
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,401
And family.

774
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,236
[dramatic music]

775
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,438
[Kim] <i>I've definitely been
in a situation before</i>

776
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,207
where my family hasn't always approved,

777
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,075
so I know what he must feel,

778
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,077
and he probably doesn't wanna reach out,

779
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,313
thinking that we are being judgmental,

780
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,315
so I think maybe
I should make the first move?

781
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,686
I think I wanna write Rob
to put an end to…

782
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,754
[clicks tongue]

783
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,988
…like, the beef.

784
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,592
I commend Kim
for wanting to reach out to Rob.

785
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,794
I mean, I… it's huge on her part.

786
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,796
<i>I wouldn't reach out
just because I'm stubborn,</i>

787
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,097
and I just don't really give a [bleep].

788
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,966
I think I would even start
and explain like,

789
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,534
"Look, I'm not, like, an idiot, like--"

790
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,069
-I have no tolerance for him.
-[Kim] 'Cause I know your--

791
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,571
It's nuts that Rob doesn't care

792
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,139
to say something.
Like, you're our brother.

793
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:44,075
The psychic wrote me
that exact thing today.

794
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,343
Who said that?

795
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,712
The psychic texted me and says,
"Hey, I'm in the airport,

796
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,848
and I see on the magazines,

797
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,217
and I'm… Like, on the TV
of what's going on…

798
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,285
and your brother…"

799
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,621
Well, why does he need
to see that if he's a psychic?

800
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,456
[all laugh]

801
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,893
[upbeat music]

802
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,536
{\an8}[Scott] I got to tell you,
you look very sexy

803
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,771
-with your beard trimmed down.
-[Todd] You like that?

804
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,540
[Scott laughing]

805
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,141
[Todd] Thank you, thank you.

806
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,678
So, do you, like… Do you know how long
the sled, the, uh, sled riders…

807
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:21,880
[Scott] Snowmobiling?

808
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,648
-[Scott] It's probably up to us…
-[Todd] It's probably an hour…

809
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,583
-…whenever you're bored.
-[Todd] I feel like I remember doing this.

810
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,819
So you go, like… up to, like,
a beautiful, like, summit,

811
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,121
where you can see,
like, a beautiful view--

812
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,457
[Scott] You don't think anybody's
gonna take pics and Snapchat?

813
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,192
I mean, what else is there to do
when you're on a…

814
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,727
-[Scott] Nothing.
-Nothing.

815
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,729
And then, I think there's probably,
like, a big open field,

816
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,531
where you just, let loose and go,
like, 60 miles an hour and have fun.

817
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,067
[Scott] Dude, you just sold
the living hell out of that.

818
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,069
-[Todd] Right?
-Do you work for the snowmobile company?

819
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,239
[Todd] So, I'm actually offering coupons
for next season if you get it now--

820
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,642
And guess what, you can save
15 percent if you switch to…

821
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,911
-[Todd] If you go to Kawasaki, yeah.
-…snowmobiles.

822
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,747
[Todd] There's about 62 more horsepower
in the Kawasaki versus the Yamaha.

823
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,116
-And fuel efficiency is far superior.
-[Todd] Really.

824
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,551
[Randy] I'm not gonna go
60 miles an hour on it.

825
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,955
-And I don't think I'm going up the thing.
-Just do every… Just go fast.

826
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,657
The faster you go, the safer you are.

827
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,660
You gotta jump [bleep].
You gotta go fast, all right?

828
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,194
-[Todd] He's right.
-[Scott] Maybe you should stay home.

829
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,930
-I'm getting worried.
-[all laugh]

830
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,133
[upbeat music]

831
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,644
[Kim] Hold on.

832
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,080
[man] And personal preference,
would you like the open face…

833
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,482
-What do you think, the open face or this?
-…or would you like closed face?

834
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,118
-Maybe the closed face.
-I want a closed face.

835
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,354
Today, we're all going snowmobiling.

836
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,123
[Kim] <i>I love doing all these fun
family activities together.</i>

837
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,225
It's been like the perfect trip.

838
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,061
{\an8}-[Kris chuckles]
-[smooches]

839
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,129
[Scott] Mase, you ready?

840
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,397
Let's head out.

841
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,635
{\an8}[Kim] Okay, look. I'm gonna sit here,
and you can sit with me, okay?

842
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,870
{\an8}-[Scott] Good.
-[Kourtney] How'd you get the water in?

843
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,339
{\an8}[Scott]
Here, you want me to give you some?

844
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,710
-[instructor] Everybody ready?
-[Kanye] Yeah, we ready.

845
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,411
[engines rev]

846
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,347
[upbeat music]

847
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,688
[Kris] Whoa. Whoa.

848
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:11,923
[Kim] What's wrong, sweetie?

849
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,424
[North] But I'm singing.

850
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,525
[Kim] Oh, you're singing.

851
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:15,660
Oh, I thought you were crying.

852
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:18,663
[engine revving]

853
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,264
[Kim] I won.

854
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,835
I think the snowmobiling is definitely
one of the highlights of the trip.

855
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:27,305
<i>It's really, really quite amazing
for all of us</i>

856
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,474
to be in like one pack together

857
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,242
going up this beautiful mountain.

858
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,978
<i>It's a really great time to get out
of your own head, I think,</i>

859
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:38,116
and just be able to let go
of everything else that's happening.

860
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,085
[Kourtney] Two, three…

861
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,286
Boom.

862
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,190
[man] Come on, Mason, follow me.

863
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,259
[Scott] Yeah, Marty.

864
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,131
Kid's loose.

865
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,805
[Khloé laughing]

866
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,273
[Scott] Having fun?

867
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,341
[Mason] Yeah.

868
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,476
-[Scott] Are you going full throttle?
-[Mason] Uh-huh.

869
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,812
-As fast as you can?
-Yeah.

870
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,582
-You're going all the way, right?
-Uh-huh.

871
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,718
-All right, don't let off.
-Okay.

872
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,455
[Scott] Here, put your fingers all here
and not just your thumb.

873
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,024
-[Mason] Okay.
-All right, lean into the turns a bit.

874
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:20,925
[Mason] Okay.

875
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,360
[engine rumbling]

876
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,538
[upbeat music]

877
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,610
[Kris] It's so interesting
because back in the day,

878
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,213
when your mom and I used to take

879
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,915
-all of you guys skiing…
-[Todd] Mm-hm.

880
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,417
…it would take us literally
an hour and a half

881
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,885
-to get you guys dressed.
-Mm-hm.

882
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,520
First, you put on the long johns…

883
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,156
then we put on a cotton turtleneck,

884
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,526
a sweater over that, overalls,
the ski socks.

885
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,563
-I mean, 75 pieces of clothing.
-[Todd chuckles]

886
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,166
I really wish… We had so much fun today,

887
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,669
but I really wish
Kendall and Kylie would've come.

888
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,038
I always miss whoever's not here,

889
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,307
just like I miss it
when Rob isn't here all the time.

890
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,476
[pensive music]

891
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,710
[Kris] <i>I haven't spoken to Rob</i>

892
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,679
<i>since I heard the news
about his engagement,</i>

893
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,582
and it's hard because, you know what?

894
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,950
He's my son

895
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,619
and I want him to be really, really happy.

896
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,387
That's all that we've got in life.

897
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,691
But when it comes to Rob,
and this whole situation,

898
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,694
<i>I just don't know what to do.</i>

899
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,662
It's making me a little bit sad.

900
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,197
That's what moms do.

901
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:34,899
Moms worry

902
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:36,934
and moms love…

903
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,035
Yeah.

904
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,704
…and moms miss their kids.

905
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,144
[upbeat music]

906
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,881
[Todd] We have to go
to the living room or be down here?

907
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,015
[Khloé] Upstairs.

908
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,050
[Todd] So, upstairs.

909
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,553
-Where'd Scott go?
-[Kourtney] He went to bed.

910
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,121
Oh, come on.

911
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:01,058
He said he wants to wake up early
in the morning and so do I.

912
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,527
[Khloé] Are you leaving… Oh.

913
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,794
But I'm not leaving yet.

914
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,062
[Khloé] Oh, yeah.

915
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,764
Is that your little foreplay?

916
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,200
You almost… Just the tip,
and then, you shoved it on in.

917
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,135
[Kourtney]
I just touched your little [bleep].

918
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,970
You did, but you got me
raging waters, girl.

919
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,606
-Yeah. Girls and guys.
-Okay. Okay.

920
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,441
Should, should we stand over there?

921
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,710
-[Todd] Yeah, but I can stand behind you.
-[Khloé] Yeah, no.

922
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,712
Ready, set…
[chuckles]

923
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,247
[laughing]

924
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,551
-[Khloé] There's so much pressure.
-[Kanye] Tell them that I'm gonna play.

925
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:27,952
I'm gonna play one round.

926
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,154
[all laughing]

927
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,390
[Kim]
<i>We have had so much fun here in Vail,</i>

928
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,492
and, when we used to come years ago,

929
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,093
all the kids would, like, play kid games

930
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,263
and then, downstairs,
the adults would play adult games

931
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,798
that we couldn't be around for.

932
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:45,169
So it's fun that now we're older
and we're playing games.

933
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,938
Let's see what it comes down
to at the end.

934
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,472
{\an8}I can't hear. What?

935
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,475
[Kim] <i>The fact that,
with our own kids and our own families,</i>

936
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,544
<i>we can really carry on these traditions,</i>

937
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,746
<i>just makes it so special</i>

938
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,182
and it's the best way to end the trip.

939
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,985
[Kourtney]
Good game. Girls win, obviously.

940
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,486
Obviously.

941
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:07,091
[upbeat music]

942
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,365
[Kourtney] Yay, we're here.
The Chocolate Factory.

943
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,499
-[Todd] Yay.
-[Khloé] Yay.

944
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,468
-[Sheila] Ice cream.
-Do you want chocolate sprinkles

945
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,837
-or rainbow sprinkles?
-[Mason] Um, chocolate.

946
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,572
[Scott] Look at this.
Do you want a necklace?

947
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,174
-[Kourtney] Can we taste a birthday cake?
-[woman] Yeah.

948
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,675
-So good.
-[Kourtney] Are you sure?

949
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,978
-Uh-huh.
-Okay, birthday cake, please.

950
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,046

[Kourtney] <i>I was definitely really nervous
about, you know,</i>

952
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,419
<i>Scott coming on this trip,</i>

953
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:36,988
<i>but I think it's nice</i>

954
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,756
that we can all hang out together

955
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,358
<i>and, like, have fun.</i>

956
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,525
I'm not stressed out.

957
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,994
<i>Like, I think it's just nice</i>

958
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,896
that we can all just be, like,
one big family.

959
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:47,965
[Randy] What do you wanna do?

960
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,901
Go… go to the river and party.

961

Oh, my god, thanks, Mom.

964

[Kris]
They only had one, but I thought of you.

965
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:09,820
-Thanks, Mom.
-[Kris] For relaxing.

966
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,290
-Lay at home in your sock shirt.
-Oh, and it's so cozy.

967
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,791
Right?

968
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,826
Ooh, Mom.

969
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,195
That's a good one, thank you.

970
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,797
Thank you, cutie.

-[Khloé] Chimichanga. Jolly good.
-[Kris] Jolly good.

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,769
Oh, the brownies look so good.

974
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,405
We were thinking
of staying tomorrow and skiing.

Me and Scott and the kids.

[Corey] That'll be fun, Kourt.

979
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,713
[Kourtney] Yeah.

It makes me really happy
to know that Kourtney and Scott

986
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,332
are having so much fun
that they wanna stay another day.

<i>I'm just hopeful that maybe
this is the new Scott</i>

I hope it's gonna last.

990

Think we're gonna ice skate tonight.

00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,479
That's fun.

992
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,547
[Kris] Really fun.

993
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,650
What time are you being picked up?

994
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,019

[Khloé] I'm out of here.

1002
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,335
[upbeat music]

1003
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,740
North's at Kanye's. Hey, North.

1004
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,342
-[North] No. No, no.
-[Kanye] Mommy's calling you.

1005
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,178
[growling, chuckling]

1006
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,180
[North giggles]

1007
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,517
[North] I want to watch a… a girl movie.

1008
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,919
-Oh, okay.
-A girl movie.

1009
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,488
Here. Give it to Mom.

1010
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:52,957
Whoa.

1011
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,992
I need a little help.

1012
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,494
[Kim] Okay, here, I got it.

1013
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,896
[Kris]
So, Kanye, how'd you like that town?

1014
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,766
[Kanye] That we just went to?
It's a sweet town.

1015
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,468
[Khloé] I thought that this was
the perfect time of year.

1016
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,536
Me too.

1017
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,538
-I love not being cold.
-[Khloé] Me too.

1018
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,608
-[Kris] I wasn't on the mountain, so--
-I would choose hot over cold any day.

1019
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,578
Kind of surprised
Kourtney ended up staying.

1020
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,815
We haven't been to Vail
in so long, and they both…

1021
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,484
I mean, we're having
a good time, and the kids.

1022
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,953
She wants the kids to, like,
get those memories.

1023
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,722
She said it was really good for them.

1024
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,124
Scott was in such a good mood today,

1025
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,626
yesterday, and the day before.

1026
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,628
I've never seen him have so much fun.

1027
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,631
Like, he was doing everything
he loves to do.

1028
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,267
I'm just happy everyone's getting along.
That's all I care about.

1029
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:41,505
The only thing
that will always be missing is Rob.

1030
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,573
[Khloé] Mm-hm.

1031
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,543
[pensive music]

1032
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,181
[Kim] Minus the little Rob drama,

1033
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,950
it was such a good trip.
Like, everyone was having fun.

1034
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,921
This trip has been so amazing,

1035
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,156
even though there's been
some drama with Rob.

1036
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,991
<i>So now that we're, you know,
on our way home</i>

1037
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,159
{\an8}<i>and back to reality,</i>

1038
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:05,596
{\an8}<i>I, you know, I reached out to Rob.
I think it's time that we talked.</i>

1039
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:08,232
So now, you know,
I'm just waiting for him to respond

1040
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,834
and the ball is really in his court.

1041
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,073
[Kim] <i>On the next episode…</i>

1042
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,676
Friday is the Lip Kit launch.

1043
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,611
I know, it's so soon.

1044
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,913
[Kylie] <i>I am stressing out right now.</i>

1045
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,648
I really hope
that everything goes perfect.

1046
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:25,816
[loud gasp]

1047
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,117
Oh, [bleep].

1048
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,285
[Kylie] Oh, my god, you guys, you guys.

1049
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,754
You guys obviously know.

1050
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,490
We should've just at least got a text.

1051
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:35,860
If you guys really wanted to know,
you guys would've said, "Is this true?"

1052
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,461
[Khloé] You [bleep] idiot,
what do you want me to do?

1053
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,063
Hold a press conference?

1054
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,098
And then there's one more thing
I have to talk to you guys about.
