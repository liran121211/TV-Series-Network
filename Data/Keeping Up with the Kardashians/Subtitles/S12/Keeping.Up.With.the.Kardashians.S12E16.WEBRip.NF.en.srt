00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,138
{\an8}Did you invite Rob?

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:08,808
{\an8}Yeah, he said, "I'd love to,
but, because of Chyna, I'm not coming."

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,010
{\an8}Have you talked to Khloé lately?

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,911
{\an8}-No.
-She's had a hard year.

5
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,014
{\an8}And she misses her brother.

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:19,152
{\an8}[Khloé] <i>No [bleep] way!</i>

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,454
{\an8}I was just checking to see how you are

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,123
{\an8}and see if I could see you soon.

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,126
{\an8}[Khloé] <i>This is the best phone call ever.</i>

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,761
{\an8}[Khloé] Oh, Robbie.

11
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,265
{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

12
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,639
{\an8}[Kourtney] Kylie.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,944
-Ooh, girl.
-[Kourtney] What are you doing?

14
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,514
[Kylie on phone] <i>Ooh, girl.</i>

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,815
-[Kourtney] Is that funny?
-[Kylie] Yeah.

16
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,151
In two years, you'll be 39.

17
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,520
Are you gonna be
going to Vegas when I'm 21?

18
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,956
If I could work at Spearmint Rhino,

19
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,892
-I'll come with you.
-Okay.

20
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,927
You got to strip club it up
when you're in Vegas.

21
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,430
-Yeah.
-We went to one, one time,

22
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:06,766
and Khloé was hanging the strippers

23
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,868
upside down by their ankles,

24
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,837
-holding them like this.
-There's no way.

25
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,773
And then Malika, the strippers had Malika

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,409
by her ankles and were shaking her.

27
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,744
Like, upside down.

28
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,313
And I was eating chicken fingers
in the corner.

29
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,516
-Oh, my god, when was this?
-Tyga was there. And Chyna.

30
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,585
[both] Oh, my god.

31
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,088
That is so crazy.

32
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,924
-Life is crazy.
-Yeah.

{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

35
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:48,708
{\an8}[Scott] So what's shaking?

36
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,410
{\an8}[chuckles]
What's shaking?

37
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,713
What do you want to do for your birthday?

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,014
[Khloé] Well, I'm not doing anything.

39
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,516
-I never do anything.
-[Scott] Yeah, you do.

40
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,318
What have I done for my birthday
for the past two years?

41
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,386
-Just answer the question.
-[Scott] I'm trying to think.

42
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,721
Twenty-five, you were fat,

43
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,423
so you probably
just tried to eat yourself.

44
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,126
-[chuckles]
-Uh, 26, you were slimming down.

45
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,527
[Khloé] One year, Kourtney threw

46
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,128
a pajama party for me at her house.

47
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,196
What year was this?

48
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,966
It was the year that I thought
I was turning an age,

49
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,701
but I guess I missed a year,

50
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,669
so that year was not a good one for me.

51
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,037
-[Kendall chuckles]
-And I had a balloon.

52
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,373
-One balloon.
-[Kendall] We can make it so poppin'.

53
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,975
"Poppin'".

54
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,743
[Kendall] Yo, do you want to, like,

55
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,546
get a yacht from Marina del Rey,
and you sail to Malibu?

56
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,315
That's a great birthday
for people who enjoy water.

57
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:30,984
-Oh, right.
-[Scott] Oh, right.

58
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,286
-I absolutely hate water.
-[Scott] She needs a flotation device.

59
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,221
I'm gonna lookup
"penis flotation devices".

60
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,056
[Kendall] Do you want to, like, bowl?

61
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,124
Roller skating?

62
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,026
Are you kidding? I would kill myself.

63
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,962
[Khloé] I love everybody else's birthdays,

64
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,797
I don't love my own birthday.

65
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,433
Really just because there's been
plenty of years

66
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,002
where my birthday just has been,

67
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,504
kind of like, dark clouds around it.

68
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,707
So I'd rather do nothing
and have no expectations.

69
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,176
[Scott] How old are you turning?

70
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,244
-[Kendall] Twenty?
-I'm only kidding.

71
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,180
I know you don't talk
about age anymore, it's just…

72
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,315
where you are in your body?

73
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,449
-Mm-hmm.
-[Kendall chuckles]

74
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,085
I like that. In my eyes, you're about 25.

75
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,820
[Kendall] Why are you
so nervous about your--

76
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,322
Did-- You already turned 30.

77
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,891
Are you turning 31 or are you turning 30?

78
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,126
First of all, listen.
[chuckles]

79
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,328
I'm not afraid of my age.

80
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,863
Looking your age up right now.

81
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,164
That's not fair.

-I'm Googling!
-No, I…

83
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,534
No, I wouldn't Google you.

84
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,103
Here, let me tell you,
you are in your prime now.

85
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,271
Do you want me to show you
what you looked like

86
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,106
-when you were 25?
-Oh, I remember.

87
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,408
-That's it.
-[Kendall laughs]

88
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,943
You want to be this girl?

89
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,478
[Scott] You want to celebrate that,
or you want to celebrate now?

90
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,581

this part of the house.

-[Jonathan] So anyway,

98
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,435
I'm addicted to this yogurt

00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,805
that Kim and Corey brought me to
in Beverly Hills and I--

100
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,706
[Kourtney groans]

101
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,974
-But it's only--
-Go Greek?

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,075
-[Jonathan] I love it.
-[Kourtney] Do you know what

103
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,543
the best thing on top of it is?

104
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,777
The honey…

105
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,947
lavender… something.

106
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:08,948
[Jonathan] I think you're just,
like, pushing honey,

107
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,351
'cause Kim told me
you're doing some honey thing.

108
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,620
-I am. I'm doing--
-So you're like the honey ambassador.

109
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,687
-What is this thing?
-I'm doing this

110
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,656
-Manuka Doctor's skincare line.
-[Jonathan] What does Manuka do?

111
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,124
[Kourtney] Which, I'm just nervous,

112
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,393
because I have to do a London trip,

113
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,996
and I have to present at an awards show,

114
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,398
which I'm used to doing
with Kim and Khloé.

115
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,800
Like, I love doing everything
all together,

116
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,137
but I just feel like,
to do interviews by myself,

117
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,973
like, to have a meet and greet.
I'm like, "Does anybody really care?"

118
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,341
-Like…
-What?

119
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:40,380
Speaking in public by myself is,
like, a huge no for me.

120
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,849
[Kourtney] I failed two classes in college

121
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,151
because I wouldn't give a speech.

122
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,986
Like, doing anything with my sisters,

123
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,088
I'm totally fine, and we're all together.

124
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,190
But just, like,
knowing that it's all about me,

125
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,893
I just don't like being
the center of attention.

126
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,728
-People care.
-Just me, by myself…

127
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,463
You're so insecure. What's wrong with you?

128
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,965
-[Kourtney] I'm not.
-They do care.

129
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,535
[Kourtney] I don't know.

130
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,838
But, seriously, if you want
to do interview questions

131
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,341
we could, like, practice
and, like, snap you out of this.

132
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,276
And I will come out of PR retirement.

133
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,011
-Yes.
-[Jonathan] Just to help you.

134
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,212
-Okay.
-'Cause it's, like,

135
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,048
-my specialty.
-[Kourtney] I'm into it.

136
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,883
-A little practice.
-All right, well,

137
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,251
-let's set up a time.
-[Kourtney] Okay.

138
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,485
Have your people call my people.

139
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,487
-I will.
-[Jonathan chuckles]

140
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,323
[chuckles]
I really will.

[upbeat music playing]

142
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,432
{\an8}[Khloé] Haven't been to lunch
with you guys in a while.

143
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,504
Isn't it gross to think
of how many people's mouths

144
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,839
have been on these things?

145
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,742
I didn't really think of it
until right now.

146
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,510
[chuckling]
But, yeah, that's…

147
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,045
-nasty.
-That's disgusting.

148
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,082
[Scott] Did you end up
seeing Rob the other day?

149
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,884
-[Khloé] Yeah, he came over.
-And?

150
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,519
[Khloé] It was nice. We just talked.

151
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,221
-It was a nice conversation.
-[Scott] Where? At your house?

152
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,590
-Yeah, he came into my house.
-And everything was…

153
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,093
-you felt good, right?
-Yeah. Like, I was just--

154
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,694
Like, I just told him,
I was like, you know, like,

155
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,830
"When I married Lamar, like,
it was really awkward

156
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,932
and I had to put myself, and like,

157
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,534
make myself uncomfortable
so the family was comfortable."

158
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,038
It was my job to bring Lamar in
and make everyone fall in love with him.

159
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,673
-It's still his job…
-[Scott] Totally.

160
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,975
…to bring her around,
and that's what I was saying.

161
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,112
Are you aware of what happened
over the weekend?

162
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,580
No, what happened over the weekend?

163
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,748
[Scott] Are you serious?

164
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:22,849
-What happened over the weekend?
-[Khloé] Yeah, what happened

165
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,150
over the weekend? Why would I say--

166
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,085
I guess they got into, like,
a really big fight.

167
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,588
I've heard they've been
having problems recently.

168
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,323
And I'm sure he's stressed out enough

169
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,824

170
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,359

171

172
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,397
overnight, you know what I mean?

173
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,499
Like, he's had a pretty easy life,

174
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,367
and now, he technically has to take care

175
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,236
of a woman and a new child,

176
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,505
and a stepchild, basically, and it's like…

177
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,740
I mean, I would think
that's a lot of pressure, but--

178
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,975
[Khloé] Yeah.

179
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,610
-I don't know.
-What was their fight about?

180
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,645
Oh, I mean, I think it's something

181
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,114
maybe you should ask him.
It seems pretty personal.

182
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,450

Well, you feel unappreciated, and, like,

194
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,144
I don't think she realizes
maybe the effect it has on you,

195
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:29,182
but, you also can't put all that
on her shoulders, you know?

196
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,783
You've got to do your own thing,

197
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,952
you've got to be strong
on your own two feet.

198

And you got to, like, do you for you,

199
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,091
so no matter what, you'll always be okay.

<i>I don't know. I just don't…</i>

205
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,971
[Khloé] Hello?

206
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,043
I love that my brother has been so happy,

207
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,479
and out and about, and living his life,

208
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,848
but hearing how upset he is,

209
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,283
I am really concerned
that Rob will go backwards.

210
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,252
I don't want him to have made
all this progress,

211
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,754
and then, if they're arguing,
or something bad happens,

212
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,656
he's gonna go and retreat.

213
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,226
-What are they doing?
-He said that he's giving her space.

214
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,695
He doesn't know how to act.
You know, she's hormonal.

215
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,298
It's a new relationship
where it's still weird anyway.

special and loved.

334
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,593
So I think it's really important this year

335
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,662
to come together
and start celebrating Khloé.

336
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,331
Because she has had a tough year.

337
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,133
Should we get some male strippers for her?

338
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,134
Yes.

339
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,402
-[Scott] I think so.
-Oh, my god.

340
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,737
-All right, well, I'm gonna--
-[Scott] Do you like that?

341
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:52,972
I'll make that call. I'll make that

342
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,039
-happen right now.
-[Kendall] Yeah, do that. Do it.

343
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,441
-I'm gonna…
-[Scott] Wow.

344
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,510
I am not so into those glasses.

345
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,811
-[Kendall laughs]
-Why?

346
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,813
Very Harry Potter-ish.

347
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,182
-Yeah, I like them.
-I don't love them.

348
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,350
I think you're better than that.

349
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,284
[laughs]

350
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,020
[upbeat music playing]

351
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,396
{\an8}[Khloé] Are you wearing
full-blown underwear?

352
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,831
[Kourtney] Yeah, I have my period.

353
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,366
Like, granny panties?

354
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,468
Why are you wearing those
'cause you have your period?

355
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,603
-'Cause--
-What do you wear out

356
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,305
-in your period?
-What do you mean?

357
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,774
-Like, what…
-I don't wear tampons.

358
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,777
-What?
-I just don't think that's healthy.

359
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,479
Hold on, let me-- Look at me.

360
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,181
Let me see your-- No, other way.

361
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,149
-You're wearing a pad?
-Yeah.

362
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,884
How do you not look like
you have, like, a whole--

363
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,720
-Well, it's not like this thick.
-I just don't…

364
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,256
The one-- You should've seen
the one in Iceland.

365
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,058
-It was this long.
-Ew!

366
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,560
-And it was this thick.
-[laughs]

367
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,263
And it had two sets of wings. Two sets.

368
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,633
-For how big of a vagina?
-I have no idea.

369
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,734
That is the most…

370
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,370
-disgusting thing.
-I have, like, thin…

371
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,872
thin ones.

372
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,707
{\an8}-[Don] How we feeling?
-[Kourtney] Good.

373
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,642
[Don] Okay, let's warm-up.

374
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,377
Let's just go up and down for ten.

375
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,912
Just take off, grab 'em.

376
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,984
[Khloé] Are you feeling any better
about your press tour?

377
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,987
[Kourtney] No, I'm still kind
of nervous without you guys.

378
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,555
[Khloé] You act like
you've never done an interview.

379
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,824
-[Kourtney] I know.
-[panting]

380
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,527
Don't you get nervous, when you did, like,

381
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,262
Howard Stern and all that stuff?

382
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,664
[Khloé] Howard Stern is crazy.
I was so nervous.

383
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,633
Any [bleep] story our family has,

384
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,802
they're gonna ask.
But you're doing more business.

385
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,537
Howard Stern,
that's more personal-oriented.

386
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,073
[Kourtney] Yeah, I mean, I'm not
doing any crazy stuff like that.

387
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,407
It's all beauty-related.

388
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,810
[Khloé] The great thing is,
you control your interviews

389
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,845
and you could then throw
a question back at them.

390
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,313
-Everything is about you.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

391
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,183
Khloé's right. I am in control,

392
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,585
and I don't have to say anything
I don't want to say.

393
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,789
She's giving me
much more helpful advice than Jonathan.

394
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,524
I have done this for so many years,

395
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,361
I just don't know why I get so nervous.

396
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,829
[Khloé] What are you nervous about?

397
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,697
Like, what questions is
someone gonna ask you?

398
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,833
-I don't know.
-I guess Scott questions.

399
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,102
No, I actually don't care
about Scott questions.

400
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,305
I can answer any Scott question easily.

401
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,275
-I don't care about that.
-Do I kind of have a muscle

402
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,510
if I do this? No?

403
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,246
Okay. Can't hold it that much longer.

404
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,682
[upbeat music playing]

405
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,726
[Khloé] Oh, hey. Isn't this,
like, your ideal weather?

406
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,895
-You love it hot.
-That's you.

407
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,363
I feel like I've seen this before,

408
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,032
but I can't figure it out,
so I'm trying to--

409
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,134
It's just this that you've seen before.

410
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,669
[Khloé] I know. I love that cape, though.

411
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,704
-It's Kendall's.
-Ooh.

412
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,272
-Can I have it next?
-Yep.

413
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,942
I did shorten it, 'cause it was so long.

414
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,009
-And she doesn't know that…
-[Khloé] That's so mean.

415
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,578
…but I only tucked it, so you can untuck.

416
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,847
Mom loaned me this Valentino dress

417
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,816
that I wore at your wedding,

418
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,952
and I tailored the whole thing,
like, sucked it to me,

419
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,620
and I never told Mom 'cause I was scared.

420
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,188
And then she asked for it back,
and she was like,

421
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,523
"It can't fit me,
I've gained so much weight,"

422
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,891
but I was scared to tell her

423
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,959
-that I really tailored…
-Oh, my god. You have…

424
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,093
-…the whole thing
-…to confess today.

425
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,361
No, it's okay.

426
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,731
[Khloé] Oh, my. Hi.

427
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,701
-Hi, how are you?
-[Kim] South of France.

428
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,235
-Oh.
-[Kim] This is like…

429
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,404
-I haven't seen you.
-…an Italian getup.

430
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,707
My Italian getup?

431
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,309
[in Italian accent]
It seems very Italian.

432
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,878
[Kim in normal voice]
Wait, can we discuss…

433
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:20,946
Your glasses are a little crooked.

434
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,481
Oh.
[chuckles]

435
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,550
How about that?

436
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,318
[Khloé sighs]
So…

437
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,753
I'm trying to find Rob.

438
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,822
I've called him, I've texted him,

439
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,724
he's not responding.

440
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,659
But he responded to Victory today.

441
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,627
He told Victory he was at his house.

442
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,830
Oh, so he's not at Chyna's house.

443
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,798
-Mm-mm.
-They're still not

444
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,500
-talking to each other?
-Mm-mm.

445
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,703
-[Khloé] How long is that gonna go on for?
-I don't know.

446
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,673
But I talked to Chyna and it scared me

447
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,409
because it was everything
that we had experienced with him.

448
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,578
She was experiencing the same thing.

449
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,214
So, she wrote me last night, and she said,

450
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,782
"Can I see you tomorrow?"

451
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,650
"I just really need to talk to you."

452
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,419
-You know, "Rob won't talk…"
-[Khloé] And that's today?

453
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,221
"…to me." Yeah, she was supposed

454
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,956
-to come over at 9:30.
-Rob won't talk to her?

455
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,657
-[Kris] Yeah.
-Why won't Rob talk to her?

456
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:09,161
I don't know, I haven't gotten
into the whole song and dance.

457
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,796
Is he ever gonna see his kid, though,

458
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,364
or is she… is she gonna take it?

459
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,666
You don't-- You really think they're over?

460
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,568
He seems, like, when I talked to him,

461
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,871
he was very much, like, in love with her.

462
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,640
Am I missing something?
How long have they not been speaking for?

463
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,741
[Kris] I don't know.

464
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,312
I know when my brother hurts,
how badly he does hurt.

465
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,447
The more they're fighting

466
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,215
and the longer things are bothering him,

467
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,717
the more depressed he gets.

468
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,218
He'll go into hiding again, go missing.

469
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,055
Like, I don't want Rob to live
that life anymore.

470
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,760
{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

471
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,033
{\an8}[Kris] Khloé?

472
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,201
[Khloé] Hi, Mom.

473
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,736
[Kris] Hey, what are you doing out here?

474
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,871
Sitting. It's so sunny in here.

475
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,707
It is sunny in here.
I love this ping-pong table.

476
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,109
Thank you.

477
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,845
Like, this is really beautiful and chic.

478
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,647
It makes you want to play ping-pong.

479
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,616
-[Khloé] Mm.
-[Kris] So here's the deal.

480
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,453
I wanted to come over
and talk to you in person

481
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,688
because we've all been trying
to figure out

482
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,123
what to do for your birthday.

483
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,826
Nobody can think of what to do
and I thought,

484
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,828
I'm just gonna come over here and ask you

485
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,430
what would be your dream birthday party

486
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,265
that we could all do
to celebrate with you?

487
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,103
I just don't really feel, like,
it has to be something so great.

488
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,538
Like, it's just another day.

489
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,607
-Like, no.
-Well, it's your birthday.

490
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,610
Why doesn't everyone just, like, call me
and wish me a happy birthday this year?

491
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,645
No. Because… no.

492
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,813
I just feel like…

493
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,050
my birthdays, I get more anxiety about

494
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,820
because they've always been a dark cloud,
like, looms over it.

495
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,590
Like, it's always, like, something like,
negative or, like, a letdown.

496
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,025
That's why we want to make it
special this year.

497
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,229
And acknowledge it, and have a party,
and make it a celebration.

498
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,431
And make it about how we celebrate Khloé.

499
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,167
Come up with a couple of things

500
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,002
that would make you really happy to do

501
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,205
and to be with everybody,
and then we'll do the rest.

502
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,507
How about that?

503
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,008
-Okay.
-Okay, good.

504
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,076
It'll be really fun.

505
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,578
[Khloé] <i>My mom is right.</i>

506
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,981
<i>There's been a lot
of negativity in the past,</i>

507
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,650
so I'm gonna take control
over this energy,

508
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,153
and I am just gonna put
in the atmosphere that,

509
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,922
"No, we're gonna have a party,
and it's gonna be

510
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,591
one of the best parties
I've ever had in my life."

511
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,326
[Kris] Oh, and we need a birthday list.

512
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,229
'Cause I know you probably have
a list going on somewhere.

513
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,798
So register,

514
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,101
-and then send me a link.
-A birthday list for?

515
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,970
A birthday list for friends,
or are we talking about gifts?

516
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,473
Gifts. Like, what you want
for your birthday.

517
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,808
-What's your wish list?
-No, I'm not four.

518
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,910
[Kris chuckles]

519
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,012
[upbeat music playing]

520
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,418
{\an8}[Khloé] Where the hell's Kourtney?

521
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,986
-[Reign] Mama.
-[Khloé] What?

522
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,855
-[Khloé] Kourt?
-[Kourtney] What?

523
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:54,893
Do you ever think you and the Lord
are gonna get back together?

524
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,595
-Do I ever?
-[Khloé] Yeah.

525
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,030
You know you are, right?

526
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,832
I don't know. I just don't know
what is in God's plan.

527
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,935
Some days I'm like, "Ah, never."

528
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,904
And then some days, I'm like,
"Okay, maybe in the future."

529
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,706
-Like--
-I don't think tomorrow.

530
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,441
It's not in tomorrow's plan…

531
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,677
-[Khloé] No, not in tomorrow's plan.
-…I'll tell you that.

532
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,912
[Khloé] Have you guys spoken
to Rob at all?

533
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,514
[Kourtney] Nope, not once.

534
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,917
Well, apparently, Chyna called Mom to say,

535
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,853
"Rob has been sleeping all-day
until 3:00 again,

536
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,622
and he doesn't wake up,
and he's not motivated,

537
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,257
he's up under me all the time."

538
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,758
She's like, "It's annoying, it's frust--"

539
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,494
Like, they were the same issues
he had before.

540
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,164
And I know everyone was like,
"Oh, my god, Chyna saved him."

541
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,365
"Like, he's good now."

542
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,735
When you're in love, you do get,
like, that high, which is great,

543
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,503
but now it's, like, reality time.

544
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,239
And I told Rob this. I said, "You know,

545
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,107
you have some issues
that you've always had."

546
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,775
"And I'm happy that Chyna got
you out of the house,

547
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,346
but all relationships fight,
so you guys will be okay again,

548
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,914
but you have to deal with your issues."

549
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,182
Totally, as he should.

550
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,284
I just want Rob to know
that, no matter what,

551
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,553
like, we'll always be there for him.

552
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,988
He has to know he could call one of us,

553
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,090
like he could come to my house,
I'm not gonna ask questions,

554
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,692
-just go in back into your room.
-I want him to feel that way.

555
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,594
Like, I want him to feel
like he always has someone

556
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,062
to turn to, you know?

557
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,199
[Khloé] I want my brother to know
that we're all in support

558
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,433
of whatever makes Rob happy.

559
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,571
And, I think, if Rob knows that we're all
supportive and onboard,

560
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,340
Rob will feel more comfortable
to talk to us about some things,

561
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,242
and maybe if we could give him advice,

562
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,677
it will help his relationship.

563
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,613
Some tensions
between Rob and Chyna will just diminish.

564
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,116
-Do you want to call him and say "Hi"?
-[Kim] Yeah.

565
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:25,851

{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

570
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,145
[Kourtney] Rob?

571
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,346
[Kim] Where is he?

572
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,114
[Kourtney] There's nothing but a scale.

573
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,215
[Kim] Ricky?

574
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,750
Where is he? That's so weird.

575
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,352
He wouldn't be here after all that.

576
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,088
[Kim] We really wanted to check on Rob

577
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,623
'cause we haven't heard from him.

578
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,226
So, kind of worried about him,
and just want to make sure he's okay.

579
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,095
[Kourtney] Should we write him a note?

580
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,299
"Rob, we want you to be happy,
and we're here to support you

581
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,634
in any way we can."

582
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,271
-K, what do you want to say?
-Call us. Love you.

583
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,540
All right
[sighs]

584
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,447
{\an8}[Kim] I called Chyna.

585
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,514
-[Kourtney] Mm-hm.
-[Kim] Just to be like,

586
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,284
"Hey, like, I get it."
"You know, you guys are, like,

587
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,986
not vibing, but I just want you
to know, like…

588
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,457
I'm here if you need to like,
talk about anything."

589
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,760
She's like, "Honestly, I used
to think it was all you guys."

590
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,295
-[Kourtney] Yeah?
-Like… 'Cause that's like,

591
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,830
the way that it is,
like, perceived or whatever.

592
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,398
Now, she's like, "I just need someone

593
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,734
to talk to 'cause it's really hard…

594
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,502
to, um…

595
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,771
-deal with him."
-Mm-hmm.

596
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,706
She's like, "I just want someone
that's like, motivated,

597
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,109
and that'll, like, get up
and like, do something."

598
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,344
-Yeah, but he's depressed.
-Yeah.

599
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,813
And so I said, you know, she's like,

600
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,150
"I could see now that it's, like,
you guys all tried to help him."

601
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,619
And I was like, "Yeah, and we thought
you were gonna help." You know?

602
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,289
But I also said, like,
"Don't give him false hope

603
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,059
if you don't, like,
want to be with him, you know?"

604
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,260
[Kourtney] Yeah.

605
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,163
I think there's always
two sides to every story,

606
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,664
and I want to be supportive of both.

607
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,299
I mean, Chyna's now family,

608
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:25,337
and you know, I want her to be calm
and feel like she has a support system.

609
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,808
You know, I do want her to feel
like she has me to talk to,

610
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,944
and to, you know,
vent to if she needs something,

611
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,045
just like my brother can.

612
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,681
And I just want everything to be cool

613
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,450
and I think they just need to talk.

614
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,686
-[Kourtney] It's been real, Rob.
-[Kim] Hopefully, he'll call us.

00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,547
[laughter]

665
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,815
[interviewer] So I'm your first interview.

666
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:24,983
[Kourtney] Yeah.

667
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,651
[interviewer]
So, if you had to swap styles

668
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,286
with one of your sisters,
who would you choose?

669
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,588
Um…

670
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,793
I would say, Kylie,
because I think she's really--

671
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,761
First of all, she does her own makeup…

672
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,196
-Does she?
-…perfectly.

673
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,499
[Kourtney] And she's so up on
all the trends.

674
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:42,934
Brilliant.

675
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,103
[Kourtney]
I was really anxious and nervous,

676
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,439
but I'm getting more and more comfortable.

677
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,508
-Hi.
-[glasses clinking]

678
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,211
Thanks, everyone, for coming

679
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,280
and I'm so happy to be in the UK.

680
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,216
I want you all to know
that I brought this amazing weather.

681
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,818
[laughter]

682
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,187
[camera shutters clicking]

683
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:05,390
-[man] Thank you. Thanks, love.
-It looks so cute over the shoulder.

684
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,126
[indistinct chattering]

685
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,731
[Kourtney] Do you have Snapchat?

686
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,399
You'll never take a photo…

687
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,934
-[laughs]
-…any other way now.

688
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,636
I feel really confident,

689
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,472
and I'm actually enjoying
doing all this press.

690
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:24,943
[Kourtney] It's actually really fun,
so I'm really proud of myself.

691
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,412
-Amazing. Thank you.
-Thank you.

692
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,748
[upbeat music playing]

693
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,688
{\an8}[Kim] Do you want cheese bread?

694
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:37,756
{\an8}[Khloé] Sure.

695
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,025
I'll do a whole shebang.

696
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,432
[Kim] I called Chyna and I was like,
"Girl, I feel you."

697
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,402
Like, her and Rob are, like,
fighting and whatever.

698
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,870
I get it, you know what I mean?

699
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,073
Like, he's not
the easiest person on the planet

700
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,174
to deal with.

701
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,310
So, maybe if she felt like
we were all, like,

702
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,212
inviting her to your party,
then she would feel,

703
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,847
like, more accepted, 'cause it's like…

704
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,950
You know what I mean? Imagine
if you were in her shoes.

705
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,288
I'll call her.

706
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,857
Would she wanna go even if Rob…

707
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,993
-wasn't coming?
-Yeah, I mean, if I was like,

708
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,861
"Hey, I'm going, come."

709
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,097
Like, I'm sure she would love
to hear that,

710
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,499
like, you want her to go, too.
You know what I mean?

711
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,835
I think she feels like you don't like her.

712
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,837
[Khloé] I don't know her.

713
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,640
Obviously, when Rob first told me

714
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,175
about his relationship with Chyna,

715
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,311
how I first found out,
it just wasn't on good terms.

716
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,313
But I don't really know Chyna.

717
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,948
I've never hung out with her one on one,

718
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,917
I've never had her phone number,
none of that.

719
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,819
And I want to change that.

720
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,787
I want to change the energy
within the family,

721
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:45,056
I wanna make everything just happy,

722
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,158
and that we're all just
accepting of one another.

723
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,227
[line ringing]

724
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,396
{\an8}-[Chyna] <i>Hello?</i>
-Hey.

725
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,764
{\an8}<i>Hi, hey.</i>

726
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,799
{\an8}What are you doing? How are you feeling?

727
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,035
{\an8}[Chyna] <i>Hey, I'm doing good.</i>

728
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,738
<i>I just, literally, like,
got King from school</i>

729
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,340
<i>and about to make some broth and chicken.</i>

730
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,943
Oh, that's good.

731
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,044
[Chyna] <i>Yeah.</i>

732
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,879
[Kim] Well, I'm sitting here with Khloé.

733
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,715
-[Chyna] <i>Hi. Hey, Khlo.</i>
-How are you?

734
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,952
-<i>How you doing?</i>
-I'm good, thank you.

735
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,020
-How are you?
-<i>Good. Yeah, good.</i>

736
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,623
Um, well, I am having a birthday party,

737
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,960
and I wanted you to know,
like, I know you and Rob are,

738
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,362
like, kind of, like, fighting or whatever.

739
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,598
And I wanted you to know
that if he doesn't want to come,

740
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,500
like, you are still invited to come.

741
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:33,037
[Chyna] <i>All right, okay. Yes.
Thank you. Yay, I'm so down.</i>

742
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,308
I am so happy that Chyna has agreed
to come to my birthday party.

743
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,712
I think this is a great step
in such a positive direction,

744
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,680
and I hope, with us inviting Chyna,

745
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,048
Rob does decide to come.

746
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,283
[Khloé] I would love if Rob came.

747
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,153
You know, it's my brother,
I wish he would be there.

748
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,454
[Chyna] <i>Yeah.</i>

749
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,657
{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

750
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,697
{\an8}-[Khloé] Hello.
-[Rob] Hey.

751
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,966
{\an8}-[Khloé] Hi, Robbie Rob.
-[Rob] I was just--

752
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,235
I spilled some, like, fish in my car.

753
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,603
Ew.

754
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,439
That's gonna be… brutal.

755
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,043
I heard Rob and Chyna
finally spoke to one another,

756
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,579
so I really wanted to stop by
to see how Rob is doing.

757
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,014
Do you know I completely just knew

758
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,016
how to get here from memory?
I've only been here one time.

759
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,617
[Khloé] I pulled over
and was just like, "Wait."

760
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,419
[Rob] It's confusing the first time.

761
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,521
[Khloé] Cute. Cute.

762
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,390
Ooh, that's a nice backyard.

763
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:29,260
-[Khloé] Rob, oh,<i> très chic</i>.
-[Rob] Yep.

764
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,396
[Khloé] Oh, a lemon tree?

765
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,599
What? Rob, this is so cute.

766
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,069
What are you smiling for?

767
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,470
'Cause it's my license picture

768
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,039
-that I didn't want to--
-Oh, I want to see.

769
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,807
-That, uh… that I…
-Let me see.

770
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,476
-…wore a hat, so I'm like…
-[chuckles]

771
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,145
-Look, it's so bad.
-Why'd you wear a hat?

772
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,647
'Cause I just wanted to get it over with.

773
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,649
No, but you know you can't wear
a hat in your picture.

774
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,885
No, I know. I just didn't care,
'cause I'ma go back there

775
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,787
and retake the picture when I'm feelin'…

776
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,655
-when I'm feeling better.
-Spiffy?

777
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,860
Oh, my-- You got to get out of here.

778
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,262
-What?
-[Rob chuckles]

779
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,665
-[Khloé] Kimberly.
-What?

780
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,967
Uh, how much are you?

781
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,002
I know, the neighbor did kind
of look at me like…

782
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,337
-You literally look like Rob--
-…a hooker city.

783
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,872
-Yeah, he probably thought…
-I did feel, like, uncomfortable

784
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,540
-for one second.
-…like Rob paid for you.

785
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,208
Like, Kim, I literally

786
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,544
just dropped my jaw when I saw you from…

787
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,746
[chuckles] Well…

788
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,882
-Chillax.
-[Rob] It wasn't a bad "wow."

789
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,117
[Khloé] Anyway, what's going on?

790
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,119
How's everything on the home front?

791
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,654
[Rob] I mean, it's been tough.

792
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,057
It's really just--
It takes either one person to man up.

793
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,726
Obviously, that's gonna have
to be me.

794
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,362
But at the same time, I'm not
gonna argue with a female.

795
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,098
We had a good talk
the other night, so, we'll see.

796
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,066
[Khloé] I'm the one who said
arguments are normal.

797
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,402
-It's gonna happen.
-[Rob] Okay, but at that second

798
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,738
it happened, I took it seriously,

799
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,072
-and I took it to heart.
-And that's--

800
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,407
-And I was like, "All right."
-'Cause you're sensitive.

801
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,175
I don't even-- I don't know.

802
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,078
You have to worry about Rob,
and how you could be strong

803
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,547
and better for you, and now your baby.

804
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,650
[Rob] Yeah, well, I'm fine.

805
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:59,717
[Khloé] Don't you want to get

806
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:00,785
-you're [bleep] together?
-[Rob] I do.

807
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,454
My plan is not to have a kid with somebody

808
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,757
and not be with the person.
That's just bizarre to me.

809
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,427
[Khloé] I know Rob and Chyna
have a long way to go,

810
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,163
but I'm really happy
that they are working things out.

811
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,033
Relationships are hard no matter what.

812
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,602
And as long as Rob is trying,

813
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,371
and starts really engaging
and communicating,

814
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,341
that's all I could ask for,
but he has to figure it out

815
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,110
and this is, like, baby steps to his life.

816
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,779
What are you doing on Monday, Rob?

817
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:30,048
[Khloé] Are you coming
to my birthday party?

818
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,950
[Rob] I'm not sure. I don't know.

819
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,186
Where else are you gonna be?
There's alcohol, there's food.

820
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,957
There's games, there's a photo booth.

821
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,525
And I invited Chyna.

822
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,594
Well, it'll probably make me want to go.

823
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,064
It's always helpful to go with somebody.

824
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,098
[Khloé] Yeah.

825
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,733
I mean, I get it.

826
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,169
[Khloé] Uh… Kim, your selfie book is here?

827
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,505
[Kim] You guys, look what Rob reads.

828
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,774
[Khloé] It's not a reading book.

{\an8}-[Kris] There's the birthday girl.
-[Khloé] Hi, guys.

-Hey.
-[Tracey] Happy birthday.

you know, can't turn back.

839

[Khloé] Oh! This is so cute.

842
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,543
I decided on Dave &amp; Buster's,

843
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,046
because they serve alcohol and play games.

844
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,614
The best of both worlds.

845
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,886

846
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:43,321

[Khloé] There's nobody here.

Holy [bleep], Dave &amp; Buster's is huge.

-[Scott] Yeah.

865

you got us matching ones.

I keep asking him,
but I don't get a response.

880
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,702
[Kris] I don't know. Let's FaceTime him.

881
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,872
He's never going to answer.

882
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,273
Have you talked to Rob?

883
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,008
Not in, like, a week.

884
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,179
[Kris] I just want everything
to go perfectly tonight,

885
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:18,449
and it would really mean
a lot to Khloé if Rob comes.

886
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,651
So, I'm praying he shows up.

887

[Malika] Is Rob coming?

There's Crissy and John.

-And me!
-Let me get out of the way.

We're having so much fun
celebrating Khloé's birthday,

894
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,182
but Khloé really misses Rob.

Oh, my god, it means like, the world to me

00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,470
to have my brother at my birthday.

901
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:16,174
I can't remember the last time
my brother was at a family holiday.

902
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,442
So, to have him here… it's pretty awesome.

-Oh, my god, hi.
-[Chyna] Hey.

and we're all here celebrating.

915
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:49,307
We're so used to not having Rob,
and there's a sadness.

916

There's always a sadness
in the air when Rob's not here.

917

And so, tonight,
we don't have the sadness.

-[Chyna] You look bomb.

-Oh.
-I'm so round, right?

932

934

Earlier it was like smaller,
it's like it grew.

I'm so glad you invite-- I was invited.
I was, like, "Yay."

You're so sweet.

I am grateful that Chyna came
to my birthday party,

'cause I think without her,
Rob wouldn't have come here.

942
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,997
And it shows me how much
Chyna does care about Rob,

943
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,634
because that's an intimidating situation
to walk into.

I'm like five months now,

am I gonna get, you think?

that Rob and Chyna finally came.

that they can work it out,

they have a baby on the way.

cool. At the end of the day,

00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,060
[Rob] The whole argument is too much.

998
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,595
She's too hot and I'm too hot.

999
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,164
Everybody argues in a new relationship.

1000
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,432
I know you've been through a lot,

1001
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,001
but you put that wall up
to protect yourself.

1002
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,536
[Rob] <i>We're just two different people.</i>

1003
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:06,804
I don't expect her to be like me.

1004
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,973
I don't even know that you know
exactly who you are.

1005
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,542
-Yeah.
-What could I do to help?

1006
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,211
[Chyna] What really triggers you
to go into a dark hole?

1007
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,414
[Kim] Depression is a serious issue.

1008
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,449
What's gonna happen
when this baby is born?

1009
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,885
You really want to spend
the rest of your life with me?
