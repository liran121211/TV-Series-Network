There's Mama. You look great, as usual.

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,345
[Kim] I should stand on the stairs.

17
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:46,479
That's quite all right.

-Even with the shoes on.
-To give you a hug.

-Yeah, that's kind of

-how I felt.
-Yeah.

24
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,160
Well, the reason I came over,
I saw something,

25
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,928

[Caitlyn] Now, wait a second. I know.

39
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,153
-And I thought of one other thing.
-That is so funny.

40
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,354
I could do this.

41
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,791
I could have this mounted,
like, right there.

42
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,259
[Kim] Oh, so you brought a wine glass

43
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,360
-with you.
-I brought a wine glass…

44
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,029
I didn't wanna put it on
unless you would like it.

-That is amazing. Oh.
-Yeah, you see.

00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,801

Uh, it kind of does, doesn't it?

00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,914
[Don] Come on, light jog. Let's go.

171
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,816
Good.

172
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,619
Good. Touch the wall.

173
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,821
Going down. Squat.

174
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,225
Good, good. Flop, and… Good.

175
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,694
-[Khloé] So Scott came over the other day.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

176
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,898
Like, I really miss him, and I just, like…

177
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,767
-[Don] Let's go, drop the bands…
-I miss hanging out with him.

178
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,669
-Let's go, right here.
-Okay.

179
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,804
-Let's go.
-[Khloé] And, like,

180
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,939
we've been reminiscing…
[panting]

181
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,742
…and I do wanna hang out with him more.

182
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,277
But what kind of things?

183
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,779
Just, like, go to lunch or this or that.

184
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,981
[Khloé] <i>This is a complicated situation</i>

185
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,050
because I know what Scott needs right now

186
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,754
is, like, reassurance,
and he needs to feel loved,

187
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,589
and that he's a part of our family.

188
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,492
But I also wanna be respectful
of Kourtney's feelings.

189
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,761
I don't want to hang out with him

190
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,362
and have something bad happen.

191
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,131
Like, where he wants to go out.

192
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,899
[Kourtney]
Right, I don't think he should hang out

193
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,334
in a going-out environment.

194
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,203
[Don]
Just jump up and come right back down.

195
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,604
-[Kourtney] Same leg?
-[Don] Same leg.

196
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,474
Three, two, let's go. One up, good.

197
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,142
I don't mind if you guys hang out.

198
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,345
I think it's good for him
to have positive people.

199
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,681
-Back. Up, down.
-[Khloé] Yeah.

200
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,682
That's right, good.

201
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,517
[Kourtney sighs]
I never wanna do that again.

202
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,918
Get rid of your stairs.

203
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,019
[laughs]

204
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,621
This guy's using anything we have.

205
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,493
[upbeat music]

206
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,563
[Kris] Hi, guys.

207
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:18,998
How are you?

208
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,601
-[Corey] It smells so good in this store.
-[woman] Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,135
[Corey] What do you wanna show me?

210
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,272
-'Cause this is, like…
-Look, these are like dog tags.

211
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,975
That's cool.

212
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,810
[Kris] Isn't this store cute?

213
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,178
These are cool.

214
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,714
[Kris] <i>I love going antiquing.</i>

215
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,984
And it's not exactly
what Corey wants to be doing.

216
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,519
Am I allowed to open this?

217
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,090
[Kris] Oh, this is so cute.

218
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,225
He likes to do things
a little more active.

219
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,994
[Corey] Oh, this is a good lamp.

220
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,963
[Kris] Oh, my god.

221
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,598
[Corey]
You're not, like, teaching me anything.

222
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,967
You're not showing me.
You're just lost in your own world.

223
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,168
You came shopping

224
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,770
-with the wrong person.
-Okay.

225
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,874
[Kris] <i>But he loves to spend time
with me and the kids,</i>

226
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:06,312
so he just, will pretend like
he enjoys being there.

227
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,780
[Kris] Aren't you having fun?

228
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,315
I'm with you. I'm always having fun.

229
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,917
-Mm-hm.
-It's the truth.

230
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,019
-I did discover one thing.
-You're so full of [bleep].

231
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,020
What?

232
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,422
You're my perfect little antique.

233
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,594
-Is that a compliment?
-Yeah, that's a compliment.

234
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,829
[Corey chuckles]

235
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,399
[upbeat music]

236
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,073
{\an8}[Khloé] Hi, guys.

237
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,809
-[Kourtney] Hi, Khlo. Hi, Lam.
-Well, hello.

238
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,145
-[Khloé] Do you remember Auntie Sheila?
-Yes.

239
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,213
{\an8}-[laughter]
-Mwah.

240
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,582
{\an8}-Ooh, I love you so much.
-I love you too.

241
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:46,218
{\an8}-[Khloé] Uncle Randy. Hi, Uncle Randy!
-Hey.

242
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,487
{\an8}Hello, baby. Aw. How are you?

243
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,855
[Khloé] Oh, oh, oh.
[blows raspberries]

244
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,157
-How are you?
-[Khloé] Hello. Hello.

245
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,626
[Khloé] <i>Today is my dad's birthday.</i>

246
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,329
<i>We are having a huge Armenian dinner</i>

247
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,396
at my mom's house,

248
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,165
which we do every year for his birthday.

249
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,501
<i>We've invited the whole family
and his best friends,</i>

250
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,103
<i>my Uncle Randy and Auntie Sheila.</i>

251
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,738
[Khloé] Scott!

252
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,806
Hi. Oh…

253
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,674
<i>We invited Scott to come</i>

254
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,243
'cause, you know,
we really want Scott to feel

255
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,913
<i>that he's a part of our family
because he is.</i>

256
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,949
[Khloé]
Wow, how good does this food look, guys?

257
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,718
So for those that don't know,

258
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,120
we are eating from Carousel,

259
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,789
which is my dad's
favorite Armenian restaurant.

260
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,459
We used to go there every year

261
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,694
with Uncle Randy and Auntie Sheila

262
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,863
with my dad on his birthday.

263
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,499
-[Kylie] He's probably here right now…
-He is here right now.

264
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,167
-[Randy] Oh, he's here with us.
-[Sheila] For sure.

265
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,902
-[Khloé] For sure.
-[Kris] Absolutely.

266
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,704
Scott, how the hell are you?

267
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,673
[Khloé] How's the new house?

268
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,409
Fine.

269
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,610
Oh, okay.

270
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,912
[Khloé]
And you're decorating it all yourself?

271
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:48,848
He's really good at it.

272
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,357
[Scott] <i>It's definitely sad, you know,</i>

273
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,126
<i>and hard for me in many ways.</i>

274
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,994
I really don't even know where I fit in

275
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,162
at this point with this family.

276
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,465
And, you know, Kourtney and I are still
in kind of a weird state.

277
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,001
<i>And it doesn't make things easier</i>

278
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,670
<i>when we sit next to each other</i>

279
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,271
<i>because I don't really know how to act.</i>

280
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,374
I mean, when you've been
with somebody for 10, 11 years,

281
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,077
and then all of a sudden
you're not, and you, like,

282
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,279
can't touch them a certain way
or talk to them a certain way,

283
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,347
or look at them a certain way.

284
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,716
It's… it's a lot of things to get used to.

285
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,418
[Randy] The food tastes the best tonight.

286
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,020
-[Khloé] It does, right?
-It's unbelievable.

287
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,388
[Kris clears throat]
And guess what?

288
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:33,626
Lamar, if you had not pulled through
your little thing,

289
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,063
we'd be going to the [bleep] Lobster
once a month.

290
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,465
So thank you for saving us from that.

291
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,867
-No, I mean…
-[overlapping chatter]

292
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,502
[Khloé] <i>I, like…</i>

293
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,440
I just don't understand
Scott's attitude right now.

294
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,575
<i>I make an effort to have Scott here</i>

295
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,377
<i>and be interactive with the family,</i>

296
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,546
<i>but instead of focusing on the positive,</i>

297
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,782
I feel like he's just dwelling
on this moody negative space right now.

298
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,685
[Kris] What the [bleep]?

299
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,458
{\an8}If you had not pulled through
your little thing,

300
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,161
we'd be going to the [bleep] Lobster
once a month.

301
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,263
So thank you for saving us from that.

302
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,101
[Kris] What the [bleep]?

303
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:22,975
[Lamar] What's good?

304
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,009
[Scott] Nothing at all.

305
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,045
How's the new house?

306
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,880
It's all right.

307
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,048
You been sleeping all right?

308
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,450
Yeah, that's all I've been doing.

309
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,152
-That's good.
-Yeah.

310
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,122
I was super scared
when I came and saw you in the hospital.

311
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,257
-You remember everything?
-Yeah.

312
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,495
I can remember being scared,
half to death.

313
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,662
[Scott] Man.

314
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,765
I couldn't handle it.

315
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:49,635
I left. I was like, "I can't…
I can't see this man like this."

316
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:55,107
I just felt like
you were just dying, like, to talk,

317
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,510
but you couldn't,
and, like, you didn't know what to do…

318
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,677
I was like…
[groans]

319
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,013
I was, I was trapped in that… in my body.

320
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,384
Couldn't even say
"excuse me" or "thank you."

321
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,089
[Scott] So, like, how do you feel now?

322
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,491
-I mean, like…
-Taking it day by day.

323
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,893
-Thank god you're all right.
-Yeah.

324
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,060
Yeah.

325
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,396
-Trust me, I get it.
-Yeah.

326
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,564
[Scott] I've been there.

327
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,066
You know, I was in rehab for a while.

328
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,134
Yeah.

329
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,737
Like, I didn't have contact
with like, the world or whatever.

330
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,305
Now you got somebody at the house,

331
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,773
somebody's always, like, watching.

332
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,408
-Yeah.
-[Scott] It's a blessing.

333
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,576
[Lamar] Yeah.

334
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,347
When I first heard
about what happened to Lamar,

335
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,916
I mean, it was heartbreaking.

336
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,785
<i>And it didn't seem like
he was gonna be able to…</i>

337
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,420
<i>turn his life around and come back.</i>

338
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,755
<i>And now that he is, it's, like…</i>

339
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,023
it's a miracle.

340
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,624
<i>He's got, like, another chance at life,</i>

341
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,892
<i>so it's pretty unbelievable,</i>

342
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,094
and it's pretty unreal
that everybody, you know,

343
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,030
stuck beside him and was there for him.

344
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,666
You ain't calling any of your old friends?

345
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,067
Nah.

346
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,502
[Scott] That's the hardest part,

347
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,404
just getting rid of all the bad people,

348
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,772
-you know what I mean?
-[Lamar] Yeah.

349
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,208
I mean, I can't really take the risk,

350
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,609
you know what I'm saying?

351
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,045
I can't do… do that
to that girl, you know, man?

352
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,313
[Scott] Yeah.

353
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,915
It's scary, man.

354
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,750
Yeah.

355
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,220
[sighs]

356
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,122
[upbeat music]

357
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,996
{\an8}[Khloé] Oh, I [bleep] hate belly buttons.

358
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,197
[Kylie] They're super weird.

359
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,799
-Like, when I have to…
-I hate belly buttons.

360
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,834
…like, scrub my spray tan
out of my belly button.

361
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,436
[Khloé] Oh, that just freaks me out.

362
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,605
So…

363
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,275
[Kylie] I went out with Kourtney
last night and it was a mess.

364
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,943
I'm over not being able to go out

365
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,745
and just be, like, normal for a second.

366
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,480
-You know?
-Mm-hm.

367
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,550
Life is life,
but sometimes I just wanna be a kid.

368
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,651
I feel ya.

369
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,621
I just can't remember
what it's like to go out

370
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,289
and nobody know who I am.

371
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,790
Trust me, you're gonna hate it.

372
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,325
[laughs]

373
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,527
[Khloé] Literally, the last time
I've been to a mall…

374
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,063
has been years. Can't tell you.

375
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,266
Like, I would love to go
to the normal mall.

376
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,967
-Like, go to the food court.
-Walk around, yeah.

377
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,736
Like, that's what I used to do.

378
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,604
-So I totally get it.
-Yeah.

379
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,973
I definitely sympathize
with Kendall and Kylie

380
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,542
<i>that they've never truly experienced</i>

381
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,379
<i>probably a normal teenage life.</i>

382
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,415
<i>But they have incredible opportunity</i>

383
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,549
<i>and so many perks.</i>

384
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,184
And it's a gift and a curse

385
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,786
<i>no matter which way you look at it.</i>

386
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,924
<i>So I wish there was something
I can do to help them.</i>

387
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,994
Okay, so there's this guy
who does crazy prosthetics,

388
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,997
like, movie prosthetics,
like you could be whoever

389
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,465
-you wanna be, literally.
-[Kylie] Yes.

390
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,035
Do you want a big ass?
Do you wanna look pregnant?

391
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,070
Do you want to be a fat person?

392
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,172
You could do whatever.
It's not just like adding a nose.

393
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,741
-This is what I need.
-Yeah. I just--

394
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,944
To prosthetic it up and go out.

395
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,147
I was kind of joking
about doing prosthetics.

396
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,216
I didn't realize, you know,
how into it Kylie was gonna be.

397
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,218
What if we did those Hollywood tours?

398
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,988
Are you kidding?
That's something you want to do?

399
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,923
You are the Hollywood tour.

400
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,225
I know,
but, like, I wonder what they say, like,

401
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,795
how they talk about us,
like how they make us all seem.

402
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,263
Okay, if that's something you wanna do,

403
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,497
I won't discredit you.

404
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,832
We'll go on the Hollywood tour.

405
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,935
Now that she's into it, I mean,
let's do this and have fun.

406
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,204
-[phone rings]
-[grunts]

407
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,806
-[Kendall] <i>Hey.</i>
-Hey.

408
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,208
{\an8}So, Kylie and I were talking about, um…

409
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,279
she just wishes that she could,
like, just live a normal life.

410
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,448
-<i>Mm-hm.</i>
-[Khloé] So, I know this guy

411
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,717
who does dope-ass prosthetics,

412
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,652
like, for movies, and, like, literally,

413
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,221
like, you will look completely different.

414
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,322
There's no way someone

415
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,824
-can know who you are.
-<i>Oh, damn.</i>

416
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,093
We're gonna have
the best time of our lives.

417
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,161
[Kylie] As long as we take a random car.

418
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,764
[Kendall]
<i>Wear something very, like, basic.</i>

419
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,165
[whispers]
Basic.

420
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,101
I know you know
what it's like to be basic.

421
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,636
-<i>Thank you.</i>
-[Khloé] I'm just kidding.

422
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,438
[laughter]

423
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,274
[lively music]

424
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,015
[Corey]
We're about to take this bottle down.

425
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,117
[Kris laughs]

426
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,953
Wow. I love it.

427
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,154
Are you starving?

428
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,289
I'm starved. Are y'all ready for wine?

429
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,191
-[Kris] Yeah, but you're not.
-Well, you are.

430
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,459
[laughter]

431
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,594
[Kris] Thank you.

432
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,195
[Corey]
So, I wanna bounce something off of you.

433
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,296
Tell me what you think.

434
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,632
I have been thinking
about, like, fun dates.

435
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,200
Like, back to your roots of fun,

436
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,870
not, like, we just go do this luxurious

437
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,571
and romantic, that's easy.

438
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,140
I'm gonna take us skating.

439
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,108
-Ice-skating?
-No. Roller-skating.

440
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,212
-No, we ice-skate.
-[Corey] The real skating.

441
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,749
In my community, there was
no ice-skating and all that.

442
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,752
We just… Four wheels. Eight total.

443
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,354
[Corey] And you did your thing.

444
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,456
Not romantic.

445
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,792
-Yeah, it is romantic.
-[MJ] No, ice-skating.

446
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:40,926
You're from La Jolla.

447
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,530
I'll, I'll… I see
roller-skating as romantic.

448
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,934
[Kris] <i>Corey is wanting to roller-skate,</i>

449
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,805
but because I had knee surgery years ago,

450
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,407
<i>the last thing I wanna do is
reinjure my knee.</i>

451
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,776
So I'm really not a big fan.

452
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,412
-Well, good luck with that.
-No, it's gonna happen.

453
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,547
I wanna take her…

454
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,549
-Thanks, Mom.
-See where that'll get you.

455
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,583
[Corey] No, it's gonna…

456
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,585
It's gonna get me
to the next level of love,

457
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,853
-I promise you.
-[murmurs]

458
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,021
[Corey] Yeah, I know.

459
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,258
[upbeat music]

460
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,199
{\an8}[Kourtney] Khloé, how many pillows

461
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,867
do you need on your bed?

462
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,470
I'm very confused by this.

463
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,938
Can I take a photo?

464
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,573
How does it inconvenience your life?

465
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,041
Taking a photo for what?

466
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,776
-[Kourtney] I'm gonna post it.
-Kourt!

467
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,811
-How many pillows--
-[Khloé] How many do I…

468
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:33,879
-should I have?
-No, no, no.

469
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,714
How many pillows do you sleep with?

470
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,815
[Khloé] All of those.

471
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,451
Oh, my god, you have so many pillows.

472
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,653
-[Khloé] Oh, shut up.
-[Kourtney] That's what I just said!

473
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,188
-[laughs]
-[phone chimes]

474
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,823
Oh, this isn't real.

475
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,958
[Kourtney] I saw that.

476
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,860
He has an appearance in Vegas today.

477
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,163
This is what I really dislike about Scott.

478
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,500
So, like, the Armenian dinner
for Dad's birthday.

479
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,400
He is…

480
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,301
[weakly, breathily]
Hi.

481
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,538
-[Kim] Moping.
-[Khloé] The most negative,

482
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,640
depressed victim.

483
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,710
He acts like he tries so hard

484
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,179
to actually play it straight
for even a month,

485
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,714
but, like, he comes and plays this victim.

486
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,216
"I lost my family.
You guys gave up on me."

487
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,618
How are you trying?

488
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,286
I was like, "Scott, I'm gonna punch you

489
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,356
in your [bleep] jugular,
because of your depressed,

490
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,358
-negative energy."
-Maybe he's depressed.

491
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,459
No, but…

492
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,296
-[Kourtney] Um, I don't like it.
-He's not making an effort whatsoever

493
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,065
to come to Mom's,
the little smirk on his face.

494
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,367
I said he's like,

495
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,769
"I lost my whole family,
I don't have any siblings."

496
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,037
I go, "You do.

497
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,572
You have all my family members.

498
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,773
No one's ditching you.

499
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,509
They just get frustrated
with you because you--"

500
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,644
I text him all the time.

501
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,379
He doesn't respond back. "Oh, I forgot.

502
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,580
I'm just not in a good place."

503
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,116
And then I talk,
and the same conversation.

504
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,884
[imitates Scott]
"What can I do to get Kourt back?"

505
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,619
I go, "Scott, you're not trying at all."

506
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,421
Yeah.

507
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,057
[Khloé] <i>I totally get
that Kourtney and Scott's relationship</i>

508
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,592
<i>is a work in progress, but…</i>

509
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,394
Scott needs to be more accountable.

510
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,830
<i>He tends to shift the blame all the time.</i>

511
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,632
And if you want a relationship with us

512
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,768
and if you want a relationship
with this family,

513
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,069
you have to try as well.

514
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,477
[upbeat music]

515
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,049
{\an8}[Kendall] Whoa.

516
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,917
-[Khloé] I know, right?
-[Shelby] Ah, yeah, come on in.

517
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,752
So you were thinking
about being a redhead?

518
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,222
{\an8}-Kind of nerdy, with some freckles?
-[Kendall] Yeah.

519
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,623
{\an8}Yeah. And pregnant.

520
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,158
Would you like to try on
a pregnancy belly?

521
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,292
[Kendall] Sure.

522
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,796
[Khloé] <i>Today, Kendall and Kylie and I
are getting fitted</i>

523
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,331
<i>for the molds for our face</i>

524
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,132
<i>so we can go completely undercover</i>

525
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,335
<i>and nobody will recognize us tomorrow.</i>

526
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,071
It's just gonna be such an experience,
we never gonna forget it.

527
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,973
[Shelby]
I think this is a good look for you.

528
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,141
[Kendall]
I should get, like, a tramp stamp

529
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,844
-and, like, put a big…
-But who's gonna see your [bleep]?

530
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,346
[Kendall] I'll wear a crop top.

531
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,081
-As a pregnant person?
-[Kendall] Yeah.

532
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,483
[Khloé] I wanna be, like, an old lady…

533
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,919
-[Shelby] Mm-hm.
-…so I heard that's, like, a big deal.

534
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,087
Age makeup, so it's, like,

535
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,255
it's a little bit more complicated.

536
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,523
[Shelby]
To do that, we would need to life cast

537
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,125
-your whole face…
-[Khloé] Okay.

538
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,326
-…and your neck as well.
-[Khloé] Okay.

539
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,961
Because we can get
that little neck wattle.

540
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,496
[Khloé] Oh.

541
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,932
-[Shelby] Then we'll do--
-Everything that I laser away.

542
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,467
[Khloé]
<i>The only way that Kendall and Kylie</i>

543
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,369
will actually really get to know

544
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,338
what it's like to live a normal life

545
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,374
and go unnoticed and under the radar

546
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,410
is if they fully transform
into somebody else.

547
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,778
<i>And, of course,</i>

548
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,813
<i>I don't want Kendall and Kylie
to do this alone.</i>

549
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,881
I wanna try this.

550
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,950
I am a big kid at heart. I wanna have fun.

551
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,619
Okay, I'm gonna not be able
to talk to you soon.

552
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,321
[Khloé] Better enjoy this.

553
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,089
[Kourtney] Khlo, I'm gonna take a pic.
[laughs]

554
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,292
Eyebrows on fleek.

555
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,260
[Kourtney] Oh, hi.

556
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,528
[Kylie]
Oh, I'm gonna have an anxiety attack.

557
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,796
I don't know if I can do this.

558
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,865
[Kourtney]
We're not covering your whole head.

559
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,967
What do you feel, like, you missed out on,

560
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,969
like, in your childhood?

561
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,204
-You just feel like--
-I missed out on being normal.

562
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,407
Being able to feel, like,
I can, like, get out of the car

563
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,908
and nobody's staring at me.

564
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,176
Do you know what I mean?

565
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,944
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Kylie] That's what I missed out on.

566
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,047
Totally.

567
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,915
I realize that it is kind of crazy

568
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,183
that we have to go through all of this

569
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,651
just to go out and be normal,

570
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,187
but it's worth it, I think. I hope.

571
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:03,855
[woman] Here we go.

572
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,192
So, what we'll do is fill it

573
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,660
-with a stone material…
-[Khloé] Awesome.

574
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,396
…and then we have a complete,
perfect copy of your face.

575
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,432
Ooh. Awesome.

576
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,268
Kourt, where's my cool pictures?

577
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,570
[Kylie] You really are a ge…
I'm really impressed right now.

578
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:22,240
[Kourtney] I didn't wanna say it during,
but I would have been so claustrophobic.

579
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,943
-[Khloé] That looks very scary.
-[Kourtney] Yep.

580
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,947
[upbeat music]

581
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,615
{\an8}[Khloé in British accent]
Hello, Lord.

582
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,284
{\an8}-[Scott] Khloverfield.
-[Khloé] Hello.

583
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,485
Come on down.

584
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,720
[Khloé] It's so nice.

585
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,121
[Scott] It's like the Hamptons.

586
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,223
Yeah. Well, don't get too crazy.

587
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,491
So, how are you feeling?

588
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,625
-Better?
-Yeah.

589
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,260
You were pretty down the other day.

590
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,363
I mean, I feel like
I always have ups and downs,

591
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,465
you know what I mean?
That's what kind of sucks about me.

592
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,600
It's like one day I feel good,
one day I feel bad,

593
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,102
and it's, like, it's tough.

594
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,604
But then, like, you… Like, it's, like,

595
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,506
oh, you're not around
and you get sad, so, like,

596
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,874
we invite you around. And I felt like,

597
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,009
it was almost like… I felt like someone,

598
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,145
like, held a gun to your head to be there.

599
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,147
[Khloé] We want you to come around us

600
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,049
and, like, just not have,
like, your guards up.

601
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,650
If you are trying to have your own life

602
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,019
and be separated, then that's fine too.

603
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,191
{\an8}[gloomy music]

604
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,026
-[Scott] Absolutely not.
-Good.

605
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,495
It's just, I think sometimes,

606
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,363
it's difficult being around, like…

607
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,265
you and everybody,

608
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,734
because it reminds me of, like, old times.

609
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,404
It's hard. It's like,
one transition to another,

610
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,839
it's kind of like culture shock,
like, real quick.

611
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,874
You know what I mean?

612
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,909
I definitely get that it's tough,

613
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,577
and I'm not trying to say it's not.

614
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:36,481
But we invited you
to my dad's birthday dinner…

615
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,883
-I know.
-…because we wanted you…

616
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,518
-And trust me…
-…to be there,

617
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,520
and I wanted you to feel, like, involved

618
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,755
and you're part of the family
'cause you are.

619
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,690
I want you to start hanging out more

620
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,159
and to start smiling more

621
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,760
and not be so moody.

622
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,029
For sure. And I appreciate it.

that she is inviting me</i>

<i>it does make me realize that</i>

626
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,604
it's not just out of pity and…

627
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,939
it is truthful.

628
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,809
<i>Just because Kourtney and I
are not together doesn't mean</i>

629

<i>all friendships are broken.</i>

00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,779
<i>I mean, Khloé and I were,
like, as close as you could be.</i>

631

<i>I mean, she was basically like
a best friend to me.</i>

And I realize that we still have that.

633
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,519
I'd rather be there and, like,

634
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,655
have that little bit of sadness

635
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,657
-than not be there at all.
-Right.

636
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,959
I moved into the same neighborhood

637
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,127
to be close to your mom.

-Like… you know?
-Yeah.

639
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,131
I could live in Beverly Hills,
but I was, like,

640
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,667
I wanna be close to the kids
and everybody and…

641
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,035
Well, I'm proud of you

642
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,704

Um, we have two nose options for you,

00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,863

-Khloé, this is so great.
-[Khloé] I have no idea

what I look like.

656
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,609
I really thought this was
my real neck, Kendall,

-and I almost spiraled.
-[laughter]

so much fun with it

662
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,254
if we play it right.

663
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,556
We're gonna look so random.
Are we gonna be, like,

My name is Lulu.

-[Kendall] Your name should be Dolores.

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,781
[laughing]

676
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:50,782
[Kylie] Look at your nose.

677
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:51,983
-Khloé!
-Yeah, I was gonna say

678
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,752
you shouldn't be talking about me.

679
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,754
[laughter]

680
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,223
Khloé's look is so ridiculous.

681
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,792
She looks so legit and real.

682
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,727
[Kylie]
Khloé, what's your old woman voice?

683
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,829
[Khloé in old lady voice]
Dolores? Dolores?

684
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,265
I got to be Southern now.

685
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,535
[laughing]

686
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,204
I was under the impression
that all three of us

687
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,307
were doing a complete transformation.

688
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:18,276
Like, I literally have fake eyebrows,

689
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,846
fake forehead, nose, cheeks, jowls,

690
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,684
and Kendall and Kylie have
fake noses and ears.

691
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,954
<i>I feel like I'm the only one
doing a complete transformation.</i>

692
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,288
<i>Maybe I'm just jealous.</i>

693
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,556
I don't wanna be the old lady.

694
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,724
Man, this is tough.

695
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,559
[Kendall]
I feel like we all look so different.

696
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,161
-[Kylie] Yeah, exactly.
-You don't have any bras

697
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,228
that would fit me.

698
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,130
No, I wouldn't.
You don't need a bra, though.

699
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,299
Oh, so grandmas just show
their nipples now?

700
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,934
-[Kendall] Yes, Khloé.
-[laughter]

701
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:46,104
[upbeat music]

702
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,008
{\an8}[Kim] What's all this art?

703
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,611
Um, I bought the little drum table,

704
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,046
and I wanna put a piece of glass
on the little table.

705
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,749
Would you do a one-inch bevel,

706
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,784
or would you do the quarter-inch bevel

707
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,188
around the glass
that was done in that period?

708
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,522
-Probably that period.
-Yeah.

709
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,926
[Kim] I heard
you didn't wanna go roller-skating.

710
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,295
[Corey] Yeah, why is that?

711
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,263
I'm 60 years old.

712
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,332
-[Kim] Yeah.
-I've had knee surgery.

713
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,701
And I'm a grandma.

714
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,170
And I don't think grandmas
should be roller-skating.

715
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,605
[Corey] I think it will be good exercise.

716
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,073
[Kris] What if I break my arm?

717
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,042
Do you remember
when Khloé was rollerblading

718
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,644
when she was little,
and she broke her arm?

719
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,879
That could happen to me, your mother.

720
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,949
I know it's not gonna happen to you
'cause you know how to ski

721
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,752
and you know how to ice-skate.
You will not fall.

722
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,121
I don't have any skates.
I do not have skates.

723
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,856
-[Kim] You rent them there.
-[Corey] No, no, no, no.

724
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,858
I'm getting her crispy, brand-new,

725
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,293
black-on-black speed skates.

726
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,395
[Kris] "Speed skates"?

727
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,763
You're getting a little carried away.

728
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,098
-You're gonna like it.
-And, oh, I don't. Okay.

729
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,733
[Corey] Stop, stop a minute.

730
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,503
[Kim] <i>My mom and Corey's relationship
is definitely,</i>

731
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,172
like, 90 percent what my mom wants to do,

732
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,641
and Corey's so easy
and just goes with the flow.

733
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,044
<i>But she never really bends for him,</i>

734
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,413
and I feel like we all need
to nudge her sometimes,

735
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,382
and just be like,
"You've gotta do this for your man."

736
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,583
-[Kris] I don't have a--
-[Corey] Stop, stop.

-…large attention span…

738
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,121
[Kris] I can't even take this anymore.

739
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,626
{\an8}[Kris]
You're getting a little carried away.

740
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,861
-[Corey] You're gonna like it.
-And, I don't. Okay.

-Stop.

-[blabbering]
-…large attention span.

744
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,635
[Kris] I can't even take this anymore.

745
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,403
I mean, the point is,

746
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,073
it's just like doing something
that Corey really loves.

747
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,675
[Corey] How about that?

748
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,245
-[Kim] You'll be fine.
-I will go roller-skating

749
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,313
with you guys.

750
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,149
And I'll go dip my toe in the water…

751
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,952
because it's something you like to do,

752
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,554
and then I'll watch you guys skate.

753
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,556
-How about that?
-Yeah, just compromise.

754
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,892
And I'm gonna laugh a lot
if you don't get off the floor,

755
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,394
and you have more fun than the kids.

756
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,795
[Kris laughs]

757
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,797
-[Kris] Well, I'll go.
-Thank you.

758
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,733
-All right.
-Love you, Kris.

759
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,768

[Kylie] What if someone asks us?

766
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,819
Like, "Are you Kylie Jenner?"

00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,154

-Say, "oh, my god,

[Khloé]
Hold on, y'all, your grandma is coming!

772

My name is Dolores,
but you can call me Dottie.

so I have no idea how old I am.</i>

Can't remember their names.

Can I get, uh, turkey, please?

835
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,746
Do you want it toasted or no?

836
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,948
-No, just plain.
-Mayo and salt.

837
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,316
And then, um,

-can we get mayo on both?

00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,030
-[Khloé] Yeah.
-[Kylie] Where?

843
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,531
[Kendall] Right straight ahead, I'm not…

844
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,433
-I'm done.
-[Khloé] There is a paparazzi.

845
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,269
What do I do?

846
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,437
[Kendall] <i>We are not even
at the tour for two seconds,</i>

847
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,506
and all of a sudden, I notice paparazzi.

848
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,974
[Kendall]
We're going home. This is a fail.

849
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,143
<i>Honestly, I am so mad.</i>

850
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,878
We sat in makeup for hours.

851
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,880
<i>This is the worst-case scenario.</i>

852
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,617
[Khloé] He's right there on his phone.

853
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,619
<i>I don't know how paparazzi</i>

854
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,187
even know we're at this location.

855
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,423
[Khloé] Oh, my god.

856
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,226
[Kylie] Khloé, just act in character,
act in character.

857
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,763
[Khloé] <i>Kendall, Kylie, and I bolt
for the tourist vehicle,</i>

858
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,598
but the paparazzi doesn't realize

859
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:14,666
<i>it's Kendall, Kylie, and I.</i>

860
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,968
[guide]
All right, everybody, welcome aboard!

861
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,303
[Kendall] You guys…

862
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,804
[indistinct chatter]

863
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,906
I'm going, I'm going home. I'm going home.

864
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,309
This is the most embarrassing thing
I've ever…

865
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,777
-[laughter]
-Oh, my god.

866
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,812
[Khloé] This was your [bleep] idea…

867
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,414
You guys, come on.

868
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,648
This is so [bleep].

869
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,016
This is so embarrassing.

870
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,718
[Khloé]
<i>I don't know why Kendall is freaking out.</i>

871
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,752
There's one guy.

872
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:39,023
<i>I've spent, like, six hours
in prosthetic makeup.</i>

873
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,224
I'm still going on this tour.

874
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,126
Welcome to Hollywood, everybody.

875
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,329
My name is Doug,
I'm gonna be your tour guide today.

876
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,964
We're gonna do a little Hollywood tour.

877
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,765
[Doug]
Well, I always feel it's good to start

878
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,568
a glamorous Hollywood tour
right next to a 7-Eleven.

879
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,236
-It's good stuff, right?
-[Kylie] I think I'm gonna Snapchat

880
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,705
before the paparazzi sells the photos.

881
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,606
Yeah, do it, do it, do it.

882
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:58,476
-They can't get the first look.
-[Kendall] Do it, do it, do it.

883
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:02,013
[Kylie] <i>We are just gonna post
on social media</i>

884
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,716
so that we get the story out there first,

885
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,652
and they can't twist it
into their own words.

886
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,988
Little bit of selfie love
back there going on.

887
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:10,955
[Doug] Good selfie time.

888
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,623
Me and my granddaughters.

889
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,858
[Kendall] It's the old Kylie.

890
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,526
[giggling]

891
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,495
[Doug] Right away, we're gonna check out

892
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:18,963
a pretty amazing studio here.

893
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,199
Does that seem like
a big old Hollywood movie studio?

894
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,834
-[Khloé] No.
-[Doug] No.

895
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,035
That's actually a casting office.

896
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,903
That's where you go with your headshot,

897
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,505
trying to get work,

898
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,507
-trying to beat out 300 people.
-Oh! Sam!

899
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,175
That's what you could do!

900
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:34,178
[Khloé] <i>As uncomfortable as we all are,
and trust me,</i>

901
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,580
Dolores is not happy.

902
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,516
<i>I just know I have to, like,
put it up in high gear</i>

903
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,751
<i>and I have to make the best of it,</i>

904
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,219
and I have to make them have fun.

905
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,653
-[Khloé] Hi!
-[Doug] The Walk of Fame down…

906
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,889
We've never been to California before.

907
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,724
[Doug]
You've never been to California before?

908
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,192
-No, sir.
-[Doug] Oh, good.

909
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,162
-Did you drive out here or fly?
-[Khloé] Oh, I can't go on a plane.

910
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,097
I got metal pins all in my legs…

911
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,232
[Doug] Oh, you have metal pins?

912
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,633
-Oh, yeah.
-Okay.

913
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,169
-And a bad hip.
-You'll get a hip replacement, right?

914
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,937
-I've already got one, sir.
-You had several.

915
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:00,972
Several.

916
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,609
[Doug]
Skybar. That is where Cindy Crawford

917
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,544
met her husband Rande Gerber.

918
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,646
You remember Cindy Crawford,
the beautiful supermodel?

919
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,281
-She's still beautiful.
-[Doug] I know.

920
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,583
Her husband, Rande Gerber,
created the Skybar

921
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,952
and it also netted him his bride.

922
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,121
[Khloé] He nutted in his bride?

923
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,490
That's very inappropriate, sir.

924
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,959
I'm glad it's Kylie and Khloé
doing this with me

925
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:24,028
'cause I feel like
any other sister wouldn't have,

926
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,630
like, taken it like Khloé would.

927
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,066
[Doug] How about Chin Chin,
one of my favorite spots.

928
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,935
Apparently, Kim Kardashian's
favorite place over there.

929
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,537
She loves to get the Chinese chicken.

930
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,839
Kardashians? The Kartrashians?

931
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,741
I don't wanna talk
about those Kartrashians.

932
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,809
[Doug] Did you guys hear about this,

933
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,778
when Tyga wouldn't let
Paul McCartney into the club?

934
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,113
Remember, the party? Right here.

935
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,881
[Kendall and Kylie] That's not true!

936
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,483
-[Kylie] That's not true.
-[Kendall] You're wrong!

937
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,785
No, it's true 'cause I read it
on the Internet.

938
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,387
So I know it has to be true.

939
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,789
-That's not true.
-[Doug] It's so true.

940
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,825
-[car horn honks]
-[woman] Kendall!

941
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,860
-[bleep]
-Appears to have gone south.

942
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,329
[bleep]. What should we do?

943
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,164
[women] Hi!

944
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,967
-[sisters giggling]
-[Doug] Are you guys YouTube stars?

945
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,204
She's impregnated
by a really popular YouTube sensation.

946
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,005
[Doug] You were impregnated by a pop… oh.

947
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,475
Even though it didn't go how we expected,

948
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,543
<i>we're still having so much fun.</i>

949
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,846
[Doug] Ma'am from Albuquerque,
have you ever seen pictures

950
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,147
of the Beverly Hills Hotel?

951
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,915
-[Kendall] Seen pictures.
-[Khloé] For sure.

952
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:22,019
But more and more paparazzi and fans
are getting a little crazy.

953
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,421
You want to jump?

954
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,455
Can we jump out?

955
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:28,426
[Kylie] <i>So we decided to jump off the bus</i>

956
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,228
and sprint to the Beverly Hills Hotel

957
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,196
because the paparazzi
aren't allowed there.

958
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,098
[Khloé] Cover your face and just run.

959
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,134
-[sisters giggling]
-Run on subway.

960
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,902
-[Kendall] Bye, guys.
-[tourists] Bye.

961
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,470
-Bye, guys.
-[Doug] Thank you, guys.

962
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,606
Take care, ma'ams from Albuquerque.

Wait. Should I take off my wig?

969
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,025
Yeah, do it.

970
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,127
Whoa!

00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,766
[laughter]

972
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,668
[Khloé] You know that tobacco commercial?

973
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,037
[in deep voice]
"Smoking kills.

974
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,740
How much are
your cigarettes worth, people?"

975
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,608
[Kylie] <i>Khloé ripping her face off</i>

976
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:21,913

Oh, my god!

That's the lady I wanna be.

That was the old lady
I wanted to be with her hair.

Hey! Wait!

985
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,093
I love you, lady.

986
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,461
I love you too, though.

987
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,264
Okay! Wigs for everyone.

988
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,365
Wigs!

What dicks are you all?

992
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,339
They got me like that

993
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,209
and you gotta look like normal old Kylie?

994
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,245
This is what happens
when you live a life of purity

995
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,013
and non-alcoholic beverages.

-with Kourtney, Kim, or Khloé?
-You! Oh, my god!

998

I've never Snapchatted so much in my life.

Oh, dude.

You guys, learn from my mistakes, people!

I am so happy Khloé did this with us.

She made this such a fun experience.

This side is still fat, though,
but this is…

-No.
-Whatever.

-Fine. Go. Go, go. They're done.
-Khloé, run.

00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,752
[laughter]

1013
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,755
-Ah, ah, ah!
-[knocks on door]

1014
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,557
-[Kim] Hello?
-[Kylie] We had the best

1015
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,025
worst day of our lives.

1016
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,995
[Kylie and Kendall]
Yeah, the best worst day ever.

1017
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,097
[Kendall] You have to watch this,
you are going to cry.

1018
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,032
[Scott] Khloé, you look like a troll.

1019
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,433
She just looks like a slob.

1020
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,102
[Kim] You guys went crazy.

1021
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,939
[Khloé] <i>Hey, guys. Is this a good angle?</i>

1022
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,843
[laughter]

1023
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,280
[Scott] <i>You know, I feel like this…</i>

1024
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,649
kind of shows me
how much I've missed out on and,

1025
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,485
<i>you know, I think I need
to start thinking more positively.</i>

1026
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,453
And, going forward,
I'm definitely gonna put

1027
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,723
<i>much more effort into being a part of…</i>

1028
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,924
some of these great times.

1029
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,693
[Kendall] We were like, "Dude, pull over
to the Beverly Hills Hotel."

1030
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,528
So he pulls over and we're like,
"All right, we're getting out!"

1031
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,730
And I hop over--
the paps get a photo of me

1032
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,199
jumping out of the Hollywood tourist car.

1033
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,701
It was so embarrassing.

1034
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,604
Was that not the funniest day of life?

1035
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:30,007
Did that experience, like,
make you feel, like,

1036
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,509
any kind of way?

1037
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:32,710
[Khloé] Subway was interesting.

1038
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,379
Because no one took
one picture of us in Subway.

1039
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,081
There were all these kids
and I saw everyone

1040
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,450
taking Inst…
photos of themselves, selfies.

1041
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,952
And no one paid attention to us
and I was like, "That's so cool.

1042
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,488
To, like, go into a restaurant
and no one bothers you?"

1043
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,990
-[Kim] Yeah.
-Even the guy was like,

1044
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,425
"What would you like?" And we were like…

1045
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,459
[Kendall] Just life.

1046
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,628
[Kim]
I mean, I think you just gotta, like,

1047
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,330
surrender to the fact that…

1048
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,131
paparazzi is not going anywhere.

1049
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,133
[Kendall] <i>We're all so blessed,</i>

1050
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,436
but I do feel like Kim is somewhat right,

1051
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,104
and if paparazzi really are gonna be

1052
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,505
<i>this much a part of our lives,</i>

1053
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,208
then laughing about it makes it
a little bit easier.

1054
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,577
They were standing next to the bus
and didn't take photos of us.

1055
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,212
And we were sitting like… Okay.

1056
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,648
[Kylie] And then Kendall walked out
of the Subway or whatever

1057
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:11,816
and they all ran up to…

1058
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,751
And we were dying, like, [bleep].

1059
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,486
[Kendall] <i>This trip was so ridiculous,</i>

1060
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,155
and we will be laughing about it
for a really long time.

1061
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,925
Um, can someone take my face off?

1062
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:24,061
[laughter]

1063
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,964
[upbeat music]

1064
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,004
[Kris] Hi, P!

1065
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,005
[Kourtney] Hi.

1066
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,674
[Kris] You look so cute.

1067
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,043
[Corey] So everybody be prepared to fall.

1068
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,578
[Kris] I have a bad knee, though.

1069
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,246
You got a bad everything.

1070
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,417
[North] Is Lovey going with us?

1071
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,419
Yeah, Lovey's coming too.

1072
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,688
I think the last time I roller-skated,

1073
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:51,789
I was ten years old.

1074
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:56,527
So I'm really not in the mood
for an injury and I'm nervous.

1075
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,929
Okay, you ready to rock and roll?

1076
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,700
Whoo!

1077
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,468
P, you're doing so good.

1078
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,371
[Kris] I can't even get my feet to go
in the right direction.

1079
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,573
Ah! [bleep]

1080
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,275
You scared me!

1081
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,811
Aah!

1082
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,679
[Kris] Oh, shi… Whoa…

1083
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,382
[bleep].

1084
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,950
-I broke your fall.
-Oh!

1085
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,154
[Kim] See, Corey's suggestions are fun,
aren't they?

1086
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,322
You're not gonna take me down with you.

1087
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,059
[Kris] <i>I knew I was gonna fall. I knew it.</i>

1088
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,227
<i>But I'm not hurt,</i>

1089
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,363
and as long as Corey's having fun,

1090
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,965
<i>there's nothing in the world
that matters more to me.</i>

1091
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,401
[Corey]
You are especially looking good on skates.

1092
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,103
[laughs]

1093
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,306
I definitely don't like to be
outside of my comfort zone.

1094
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,474
<i>But you know what?</i>

1095
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,177
<i>I must say that it's been really great</i>

1096
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,278
<i>being here with Corey</i>

1097
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,347
<i>and just spending some time
doing something</i>

1098
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,149
that makes Corey really happy.

1099
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,051
It was a good date that you organized.

1100
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,286
-Well, I…
-[Kris] A really good date.

1101
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,721
I appreciate
you trying something different

1102
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,290
-and out of your comfort zone.
-[Kris laughs]

1103
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,091
But this is cool.
This is what I like to do.

1104
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,726
[Corey]
This is what I used to do two days a week.

1105
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,428
-Put my right hand in my pocket.
-Oh, my god.

1106
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,064
I had my 10 dollars
for my hot dogs and my drinks.

1107
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,699
And then the other little young lady

1108
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,634
that needs something to drink,
she was a little parched.

1109
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:13,070
{\an8}Uh-huh. So you're like
a 10-dollar date guy.

1110
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,005
{\an8}[Corey] No, I would loan a girl 50 cents

1111
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,607
if they needed 50 cents or a dollar.

1112
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,508
Mm.

1113
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,310
Will you loan me a dollar?

1114
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,978
-'Cause I need to call us…
-I would loan you my life.

1115
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,813
-…a Slurpee.
-I will loan you my life.

1116
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,784
[Kim] <i>Next on</i>
Keeping Up with the Kardashians…

1117
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,286
I was thinking of getting
one of those people that look like Kim.

1118
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,955
-[Jonathan] What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

1119
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,022
[Jonathan] Well, this is Camilla.

1120
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,057
What is going on?

1121
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:33,991
[Jonathan] This is awkward.

1122
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,660
You know how everybody says
there's, like, that Kardashian curse?

1123
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,562
-For the men?
-Yes.

1124
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,597
You do have a curse.

1125
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,234
Your reading is talking
about working with a rooster.

1126
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,769
We're gonna, like,
proceed with our divorce.

1127
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,272
I think Lamar needs us as a family.

1128
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,407
But Lamar and I are not together.
