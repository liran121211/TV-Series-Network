[Kim] Oh, that's right.
It's like his vibe though.

No, but I asked him.
I said, "Have you been having

reason for concern. I can--

-I just feel bad.

is so bothersome to me,

when I'm in my moods,

105

how to get me out of my moods.

106

when you're in a foreign country

157

I had to deal with visas and customs.

158
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,162
And I was like,
I don't need to get arrested

159

-on the border of Cuba.
-Yeah. Yeah.

160
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:41,868
But it looks so cool.
And now I'm like, "What am I doing?"

161
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,803
Like, "Why am I in California,
and everyone's in Cuba,"

162
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,871
-you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

163
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,974
I heard that in Cuba,
there is literally no cell service.

164
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,511
But of course, the girls happened
to figure out how to get the Internet,

165
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,212
and I have to say,

166
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,581
now the girls are posting all these photos

and Cuban cigars,

168
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,987

00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,325
Well, look at it this way,
you just fixed my television today.

171
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,693
-That should be good.
-[Scott] You know what?

172
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,562
-I can rest well tonight.
-Yeah. That's right.

173
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,631
[dance music playing]

174
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,873
[paparazzi clamoring]

175
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,145
[Kim] When we first got here,
we were living life,

176
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,481
rolling around town.
No one knew who we were.

177
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,216
But the word is spreading,

178
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,751
so now, like, people are showing up

179
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:35,354
and paparazzi, and it's starting
to get a little bit hectic.

180
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,057
-[horns honking]
-[Kanye] We love you!

181
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,292
[Kanye laughing]

182
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,526
Easy, Daddy.

183
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,727
-Hi. Good morning.
-Hi.

184
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,330
-Hi. How are you, Armando?
-I wanna go to the front.

185
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,766
[Malika] Just sit with KoKo.

186
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,634
[indistinct chatter]

187
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,369
[Kourtney] Mase, scoot over.

188
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,774
[upbeat music playing]

189
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,577
[Khloé] I thought no one knew
who we were here.

190
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,278
[Malika] That's far from the truth.

191
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,848
[dance music playing]

192
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,388
-[Khloé] Thank you.
-You're welcome.

193
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,758
[Khloé] Today, we are gonna go
salsa dancing with everybody.

194
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,828
This is not something that I typically do,

195
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,164
but that's the point,
is being somewhere new,

196
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,298
trying new things,

197
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,901
and just stepping outside
your comfort zone. This is fun.

198
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,772
{\an8}[Kanye] Babe, this might be able to work
as a skirt, like, on the low.

199
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,242
[North] I want my skirt, Mama.

200
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,910
{\an8}-[Kim] You want a skirt?
-[North] Yeah.

201
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,645
[Kim] We forgot to bring it.
You have a purple skirt

202
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,981
at the house. That's so annoying.

203
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,416
You can't salsa dance without dresses,

204
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,185
and we left ours at the hotel.

205
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,220
Thank God, my husband has the skills.

206
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,724
I'm so glad that he figured this out
and made it happen.

207
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,794
Oh, my god,
Kanye is making her an entire dress.

208
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:54,367
This is the most genius thing
I have ever witnessed.

209
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,903
-What's that?
-You.

210
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,138
Designing your wife's skirt.

211
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,275
-The cutest thing ever.
-So cute.

212
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,511
Yes, Kimmy! I love it!

213
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,747
[Malika] Now, can you make
your daughter a skirt?

214
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,782
-Yeah.
-[Kim] If North didn't have a dress,

215
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,617
she would feel so left out.

216
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,687
Everyone is happy and looks very Cubano.

217
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,122
So, do you know how to dance salsa?

218
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,156
-No.
-No.

219
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,224
[instructor] So, why don't you try it?

220
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,392
-Yes.
-[chuckles]

221
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,960
Let me show you first how to do it.

222
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,295
Actually, it's very simple.

223
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,397
And after that,
so we can join with the guys.

224
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,866
-[Khloé] Okay.
-The first step is forward.

225
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,702
One, so, two on the spot, and three.

226
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,470
We close, and now we go back.

227
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,807
We do our leg, like, five, six, and seven.

228
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,077
[instructor] This is the basic step. Okay?
So let's try again.

229
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,581
One, two, three, and five, six, seven.

230
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,382
And now we change into the second one.

231
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,420
And one, two, three, and five, six, seven.

232
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,856
And one, two, three, and five, six, seven.

233
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,392
Okay, so now let's add one more step.

234
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,195
[Kim] Even though I hate dancing,
I'm gonna be a trouper.

235
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,563
Everyone else is excited,

236
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,865
and I know North will be excited
just to see this.

237
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,301
[dance music playing]

238
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,036
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

239
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,041
They're having so much fun.

240
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,110
[dance music continues playing]

241
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,318
[Kim] It's so good to see
Khloé letting loose,

242
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,853
having so much fun.

243
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,221
This is just one of those moments

244
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,890
where it just makes you so happy.

245
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,626
I just hope that Khloé is gonna make

246
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:27,927
the best of the trip

247
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,996
and continue on and have a good time.

248
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,867
[all whooping, cheering]

249
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,970
{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

250
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,974
{\an8}-[Scott] <i>Kris?</i>
-[Kris] <i>Hey.</i>

251
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,143
{\an8}[Scott] Hi. So?

252
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,111
So?

253
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,179
I came up with a master plan.

254
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,314
A master plan for what?

255
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,383
[Scott] For feeling
like I'm missing out on Cuba.

256
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,852
[Kris] You still have Cuba FOMO?

257
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,720
[Scott] Have you seen all the pictures

258
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,922
they're posting on Instagram?
With all these

259
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,124
-little Cuban outfits…
-They're colorful.

260
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,559
…and Cuban sandwiches
and Cuban chicken and Cuban cars

261
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,694
and all these things, and it's like…

262
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,062
-[Kris laughs]
-…enough is enough.

263
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,563
So I'm bringing Cuba to me.

264
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,232
-[Kris] I love it. I'm in.
-Yeah.

265
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,402
All we got to do is get, like,
some chicken, vegetables,

266
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,203
throw some plantains in the air.

267
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,540
We could put on some old,
little, like, pastel clothes

268
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,777
that Kourt and Kim have been wearing
with the little tube tops.

269
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,346
[laughs]
They sure do look good though.

270
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,313
-They look amazing.
-I know.

271
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,782
-I'm pissed off.
-I'm not gonna wear

272
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,949
a tube top, but I hear you.

273
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,318
What do I know?
I'm just a guy trying to get to Cuba.

274
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,255
If I can't go to Cuba,
I'm bringing Cuba to me.

275
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,990
The embargo's over, baby.

276
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,758
-Okay.
-I'm going Cuba, full force.

277
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,393
-I wanna be part of the party.
-I appreciate you

278
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,795
-being a part of the party.
-Okay.

279
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,997
When Kourtney's been away
with the kids in the past,

280
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,666
Scott has used this as almost an excuse

281
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,136
to do whatever he wants to do
and hang out with his friends,

282
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,273
but I think it's really a testament

283
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,142
to how Scott is changing
in such a great way,

284
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,346
because he really wants
to hang out with me and Kylie

285
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,882
while Kourtney's out of town
with the kids,

286
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,818
and that's really impressive.

287
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,985
-[Kris] I'm in.
-All right.

288
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,220
-Okay. Done.
-Done.

289
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,254
I'm go-- I'm getting out of here.

290
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,422
-Okay. Okay.
-I'm going to work.

291
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,391
[Scott] All right, I'll see you
tomorrow in Cubaville.

292
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,762
[upbeat music playing]

293
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,599
Look where we are right now.
This is absolutely perfect.

294
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,468
I'm gonna eat some rice and beans,

295
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,137
'cause they're my favorite food.

296
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,010
{\an8}-[Kourtney] I'm serious.
-[Mason] Mama, what can I have?

297
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,947
I ordered you guys rice, chicken,

298
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,783
same kind of stuff we're gonna eat
the whole time we're here.

299
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,518
[Khloé] Want some bread, Mase?

300
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,720
Want to dip it? Do you want to try it?

301
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,789
[Kourtney] The salsa dancing
was everything.

302
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,160
Kourtney, we are the world's
worst dancers ever.

303
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,062
I just hope you know.

304
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,731
Everyone is like this, like, so cazh.

305
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,033
-You and I are like…
-[laughs]

306
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,635
[Malika] Oh, stop. It hurts.

307
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,137
[laughter]

308
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,172
Like, we cannot dance.

309
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,008
Kourtney, push play.

310
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,877
You're gonna die. Push play.

311
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,545
-[Khloé] Push play.
-Oh, my god.

312
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,780
-I'm dying already.
-[Khloé] Look at your arms.

313
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:01,847
You're so mom.

314
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,415
[Malika] That's not it at all.

315
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,817
[laughter]

316
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,352
[Kim] There you go.

317
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,087
-So cute.
-[Khloé] Kim, watch it.

318
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,990
Wait. No, look at Khloé.
Khloé's, like, into it.

319
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,258
[Khloé] I really tried to give it my all.

320
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,759
-[Kourtney] Look at Kim.
-[chuckles]

321
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,394
[laughs]

322
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,962
I couldn't move with my skirt.

323
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,732
[Khloé] I was getting a little too hip-hop

324
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,400
-rather than salsa.
-[Stephanie] Yours is very hip-hop.

325
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,302
-[Khloé] We are so bad.
-[Malika] Good times.

326
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,639
Like, it was, like,
our biggest fight that, like,

327
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,909
I don't dance
at Kanye's concerts. You know?

328
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,577
You're like,
"I don't dance. Period, babe."

329
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,745
-"I love your shows!"
-I did not dance

330
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,246
on <i>Dancing with the Stars.</i>

331
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,615
-[Kim] Like, I did not dance.
-[laughs]

332
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,684
[Malika] Look, it's not for everybody.

333
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,922
My biggest fear was,
during <i>Watch the Throne</i>,

334
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,890
that if I, like, sit next to Beyoncé,

335
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,193
'cause she dances
and she's up, like, you know.

336
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,396
So, in the last night of the tour,
she came to the dressing room,

337
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,831
was like, "Hey, do you want
to sit together?"

338
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:52,865
And I was like…

339
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,800
[fake sobbing]
No.

340
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,635
And then she wanted to go in the mosh pit,

341
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,038
and I was like, "Wait,
what do we do in the mosh pit?"

342
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,739
She's like, "Dance!"

343
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,808
"Just let loose, just dance!"
And I was like…

344
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,945
-"My life is over."
-No!

345
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,348
[upbeat music playing]

346
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,188
{\an8}-[Scott] Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey.

347
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,959
We're not in Cuba.
I'm bringing Cuba to us!

348
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,260
-Oh, my god.
-Are you ready?

349
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,162
[Scott] Jordyn?

350
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,397
{\an8}-Oh, my god.
-[Scott] Were you supposed to go to Cuba?

351
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,832
{\an8}-No.
-Well, you are now.

352
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,467
I'm down to try it.

353
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,803
Thanks for being a good sport.
It's, like, rice and beans.

354
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
-I mean…
-[Jordyn chuckles]

355
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,372
[Scott] In order to get my Cuba on,

356
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,008
there's definitely some levels
and steps I have to take.

357
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,844
I want to ease everybody into
where I'm going with this thing.

358
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,446
I don't want to just jump in there,

359
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,115
dancing around town with a cigar
popping out of my mouth.

360
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,417
So today, just Cuban food.

361
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,819
Holy…

362
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,988
This has got a heavy, uh, aroma to it.

363
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,523
[Kylie] An aroma.

364
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,925
-Okay.
-[Scott] So, plantains.

365
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,260
-Those look good.
-[Kylie] Okay.

366
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,028
-They look like buffalo wings.
-[Jordyn giggles]

367
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,564
I didn't need to go to Cuba
to see a [bleep] buffalo wing.

368
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,734
[Scott] Holy Chicago,
this is a lot of rice.

369
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,736
[Kris] I knew I smelled something.

370
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,671
-Welcome to Cuba!
-Whoa!

371
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,274
Cuba? This looks like my kitchen.

372
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,242
Yeah, but it's Cubano now.

373
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,878
Oh, okay. Do you want me
to get you a plate?

374
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,680
-I guess. Yeah, all right.
-Okay.

375
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,649
I mean, this looks good,
chicken and onions.

376
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,417
[Scott] I didn't need to go
to Cuba to see that.

377
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,551
[Kris chuckles]

378
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,086
[Kris] This is pretty cute though.

379
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,222
I mean, who else would go out
of their way to do this?

380
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,291
[Scott] Not many, not many.

381
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,358
[Kylie] Okay.

382
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,860
[Jordyn] Okay, you just went for it.

383
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,361
-[Kylie] You like it?
-All right.

384
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,698
-[Kylie] This is really good.
-[Kris] Good job, Scott.

385
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,333
I feel like we need some Cuban music.

386
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,302
[Cuban music playing]

387
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,937
[laughs]

388
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,705
-[Kris] Oh, my god.
-Don't worry, fella.

389
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,074
I got a pocket speaker.

390
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,342
[Jordyn laughs]

391
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,411
Let's get it, girls.

392
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,881
[Scott] Oh, yeah!

393
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,751
[Scott] Who needs to travel?

394
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,688
This music. I'm sorry. I'll just…

395
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:56,922
-[music slows down]
-Whoa! Whoa!

396
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,557
-Just a little bit.
-Where do you think you are,

397
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,359
-America?
-Just a little bit.

398
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,627
[Scott] You can't just go
turning down the music

399
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,595
in the middle of Cuban lunch.

400
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,097
[upbeat music playing]

401
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,738
{\an8}[Kanye] You look so hot, babe.

402
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,939
[Kim] Thanks, babe.

403
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,908
Especially here in, like, Cuba.

404
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,043
Like, appropriately hot for Cuba.

405
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,812
[Kim] What would my life have been

406
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,947
if I was with anybody else?
Like, all my friends,

407
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,750
if I haven't seen them for a while,
they're like, "You guys are twins."

408
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,386
"Like, could you ever imagine
your life with anyone else?"

409
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,222
Like, "What else would you do?"
And I was like, "I know."

410
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,260
[Kim] I gotta see if Khloé won't help me
with North on Mother's Day.

411
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,062
{\an8}-[Kanye] Where are you going to be?
-[Kim] New York.

412
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,566
{\an8}[Kanye] We didn't plan
to be together on Mother's Day?

413
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,036
I booked a photoshoot
that lands on Mother's Day,

414
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,838
and now that I'm getting back into work,

415
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,473
like, everything's moving so fast,

416
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,675
and it's just one of those sacrifices

417
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,743
I'm gonna have to make.

418
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,513
{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

419
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,655

[car horn honks]

421
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,194
[French] If I had this
back in the days, man.

422
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,497
Oh, forget about it. Come on!

423
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,066
-Where are the ladies?
-Where you at, man?

424
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,370
I'm already jealous that I feel like
I'm missing out on this whole Cuban trip.

425
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,607
So, today, I'm upping
the ante a little bit.

426
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:22,875
-[horn honks]
-[Kris] Wow.

427
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,209
Come on!

428

{\an8}-[Kylie] That is so cool.
-Ladies.

429
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,246
{\an8}-[Kylie] No!
-[Scott] You think

430
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,881
{\an8}they're gonna have Cubans?

431
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:29,848
-[Kris] Frenchie?
-[Kylie] You guys,

432
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,150
-this is perfect!
-How are you doing, ladies?

433
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,918
-[Scott] How are you?
-This is amazing.

434
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,019
-[Scott] Want to hop in?
-[Kris] We want to hop in.

435
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,187
[Scott] No problem, girls.

436
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,790
-This is unbelievable.
-[Scott] Hop in.

437
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,225
Scott and French are so crazy.

438
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,496
But I love this car,
and I'm down for the ride.

439
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,597
Who needs Cuba?

440
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,299
-[Kris] We got Cuba.
-We got it right here.

441
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,768
[French] The AC don't work
in here, but it's okay.

442
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,904
Now you guys know
how I felt, 50 years ago.

443
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,741
-[laughter]
-Come on, girls. Let's do this!

444
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,010
Ay, caramba!

445
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,145
-[Kris] I love the music.
-I don't even know how to, like,

446
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,346
-hold this in my mouth.
-It's, like, so amazing.

447

-Want to light it?
-[Kris chuckles]

448
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,150
This is a nice little ride.

449
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,053
Oh, whoa, Frenchie.

450
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,888
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

451

[Cuban music playing]

452
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,094
-This is disgusting.
-[laughter]

453
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,261
This is so gross.

454
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,330
This is the way to live life, man.

455
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,666
Cuba's feeling good.
We didn't even have to get on a plane.

456
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,268
-Cuba's nice!
-I want to hit the dance floor.

457

By the time I'm done with the carpet,
it's gonna be smoking.

[exaggerated laughter]

This is what people did in the '50s.

461
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,148
They just drove around.

462
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,016
[Kris] There wasn't a lot to do.

463
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,419
That's a nice way to live, man.

464
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,954
[Kylie] Wait. I will say, though,

465
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,689
my Lip Kit launches in 40 minutes.

466
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,324
-Oh, yeah.
-[Kylie] Less than 40 minutes.

467
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,725
[Kris] Oh, [bleep], yeah. You're right.

468
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,661
I completely forgot.
That's all the time we have.

469
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,097
-You show me where--
-And step on it.

470
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,266
-You show me where to go, y'all.
-Okay, step on it.

471
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,235
We don't have time to [bleep] around.

00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,971
[Scott] The whole bringing Cuba to LA vibe

473
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,140
was going pretty, pretty well.

474
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,243
But, of course,
Kris and Kylie started talking

475
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,612
about Lip Kit launches,

476
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,147
so, in a nutshell,

477
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,082
you can never slow anybody down, I guess.

478
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,518
Okay, we got to go home. So, step on it.

479
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,521

Cuba's not all it's cracked up to be.

482
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,731
and we have one last dinner
planned at La Guarida

483
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,266
before we go back to LA tomorrow.

484
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,768
[Khloé] You guys,
how gorgeous is this place?

485
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,237
-So fabulous.
-[laughter]

486
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,173
-[Khloé] Hi, guys.
-[Mason] Hey, what's up?

487
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,675
-[Khloé] Hello there.
-[Mason] Hi, Northy.

488
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,210
[Kanye] Do you guys have sangria?

489
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,578
[Khloé] She loved-- Those were
the bananas we had earlier.

490
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,879
[Kim] You like the bananas?

491
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,615
[Kourtney] I think we'll have
one, two, three, four,

492
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,983
-five sangrias.
-[waiter] Sangrias?

493
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,385
Right? 'Cause everybody…

494
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,020
Okay. We were looking around

495
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,289
when we were driving,
at the end of the day,

496
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,624
how chill everyone is, like, people.

497
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,892
They're just, like, lax.

498
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,595
'Cause they have no Internet
or social media.

499
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,664
They're, like, sitting on
the bus and they're just, like,

looking out the window, like, really…

-[Kim] Yeah, we saw a bus too.
-…calm.

502
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,336
[Kanye] Did you like the beans, Northy?

503
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,705
Did you like the rice?

504
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,174
How do you feel about
that white dress you're wearing?

505
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,511
I was just thinking
that even the first two questions…

506
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,545
[laughter]

507
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,049
…were so, like,
what I would probably ask you.

508
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,084
-[Kanye] Do you like what you're eating?
-[laughs]

509
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,553
[Khloé] What is Mom doing, by the way?

510
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,821
[Kim] She's with Kylie.

511
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,091
Didn't they ask you
about doing Adidas for her?

512
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,259
They didn't ask me, but--

513
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,161
Kanye was doing his Adidas deal.

514
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,495
Mom called the people

515
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,431
that Kanye was doing
his deal with and said,

516
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,899
"Hey, we want to do a deal for Kylie."

517
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,268
But they only have
a certain budget a year,

518
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,904
'cause they were looking at him
like a celebrity deal.

519
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,241
So then, she shot the campaign for Puma.

520
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,676
But did she tell Kanye after that?

521
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,711
No.

522
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,549
And then, once it was announced,
Kanye found out.

523
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,951
This is what Puma is,
y'all got to really realize.

524
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,720
It's like if I made a show on Sunday night

525
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,321
and didn't tell none of y'all about it.

526
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,557
But I had did a couple of shows
with y'all,

527
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,125
just two shows with y'all first.

528
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,328
So people saw me and thought,
"Aw, oh, he's cool on camera," blah, blah.

529
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,997
Somebody offered me a deal

530
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,667
and I, like, did it
and didn't tell none of y'all,

531
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,736
and brought all of my, like,
whatever cool friends.

532
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,972
Like, now it's like Jay-Z, Beyoncé,
blah, blah, is all on the show.

533
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,675
I mean, I don't agree with going
against the family in that way.

534
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,311
I think Mom or Kylie, whoever,
should've presented it

535
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,446
-to Kanye first.
-A hundred percent.

536
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,617
[Kim] Kanye had Kylie walk
in his first two Yeezy shows.

537
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:26,852
[stage manager]
All right, models, line up.

538
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,554
[man] Gonna start soon.
Dress! Go with the lineup.

539
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,558
[Kim] He really believed in her
as a part of his brand.

540
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,993
And you know?

541
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,531
I understand that my mom's job
as a manager is to get us deals,

542
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,833
but sometimes, I feel like

543
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,369
everything has to be
really carefully played out.

544
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,573
And I feel like that was, like,
a conflict of interest.

545
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,842
Our family, they're human beings first,

546
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,177
and, even with family,

547
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,479
people choose self, they just do.

548
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,817
P?

549
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,524
[Khloé] Northy, did you know
that your mommy is our sister?

550
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,194
You know Auntie Kourtney
and KoKo are my sisters?

551
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,896
Mm… yeah.

552
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,166
Just like baby brother's your brother?

553
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,233
Yeah.

554
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,835
[Kanye] So what's gonna happen
on Mother's Day?

555
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,504
Are we going with you
or you just don't want to see,

556
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,140
uh, your, uh, husband
and children on Mother's Day?

557
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:26,945
So now they want me to go to my fitting
at 5 p.m. on Sunday,

558
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,248
so that means I'm gonna have
to leave at, like, 6 a.m.

559
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:34,119
I feel really bad,
but I made this commitment,

560
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,555
and I've already had
to reschedule this once,

561
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,256
so I feel bad pulling out

562
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,625
because I'm just not that person
when it comes to work.

563
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,227
Like, I always stay committed.

564
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,596
[Khloé] Why don't you just tell them
you won't do your fitting

565
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,164
-until the morning of…
-[Kourtney] The morning of the show.

566
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,033
Say, "It's not an option."
"It's my Mother's Day,

567
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,335
the first one with my son."
Just be dramatic.

568
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,237
-[Penelope muttering]
-Boss up.

569
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,739
-It's honest, and I think…
-[Khloé] It is honest.

570
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,574
…anyone could really respect that.

571
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,543
What do you want me to do
exactly on Mother's Day?

572
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,581
[upbeat music playing]

573
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,223
-[Khloé] So, Malika, are you packed?
-[Malika] Yeah.

574
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,158
-Did you have fun?
-I had the best time.

575
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,559
-[Khloé] Right?
-I called it on our way in.

576
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,828
-Would you come back here?
-Yeah, I would.

577
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,597
-I love it.
-I would.

578
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,866
I love it. I lo--

579
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,635
I hope they just keep this 1950s vibe.

580
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,170
I mean, they could, like, modernize it

581
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,371
-a little bit if they want.
-Yeah.

582
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,640
Maybe, like,
just the hotel that you stay in,

583
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,576
but I think, like, I love this look.

584
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,111
It's so cool. I love that you have no--

585
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,347
You're going to someone's house
and it's a restaurant.

586
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,415
Like, it's so cool.

587
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,649
Like, yesterday
when we were going to lunch,

588
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:38,850
I was like, "Where are we going?"

589
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,387
And everyone is so nice here.
And I love Armando.

590
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,456
-Like, a lot.
-You really love Armando.

591
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,324
He's just so informed.

592
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,593
Like, if I were to take you around,

593
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,762
like, California, I'd literally be like…

594
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,499
"Here's Robertson,
I can't tell you any facts about there."

595
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,134
-Yeah.
-Like, he knows everything

596
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,103
going back to, like, the 1700s.

597
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,505
-Armando is the best.
-Khloé, you can't take him home.

598
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,908
He's, like, the nicest man.

599
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,277
Let's go so we can catch our flight.

600
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,479
[Malika] Thank you for an amazing trip.

601
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,114
Another amazing memory.

602
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,950
[upbeat music playing]

603
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,221
Good morning, Khloé.

604
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,056
{\an8}-Good morning!
-[chuckles]

605
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,191
Armando, did you know

606
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,893
that you're Khloé's
favorite person in Cuba?

607
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,195
-Me?
-Yup!

608
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,596
-Oh, thank you.
-Yes!

609
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,665
I love you. You're so great.

610
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,733
Another nice day.

611
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,670
-Beautiful.
-Came, we saw, we conquered.

612
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:33,271
[Khloé] That we did.

613
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,941
I absolutely loved this Cuba trip.

614
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:40,312
Not having a cell phone
was, like, super nice and enjoyable.

615
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,715
And I wish we could stay longer,
but I gotta get back to reality

616
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,651
and figure out everything
that's been going on since I've been gone.

617
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,553
A lot could happen in three days.

618
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,090
Has a lot changed
since, like, Obama came here?

619
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,459
Cuba changed five years ago

620
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,062
when they had the opportunity
for the private business.

621
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,765
Do you like when people want to come here
to develop new things?

622
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,334
-No. No.
-No?

623
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,835
The Cuban people are always the same.

624
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:04,903
-Yeah.
-No change.

625
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,404
I don't want it to change.

626
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,140
It's perfect how it is.

627
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,977
[Malika] Say bye to Cuba.

628
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,278
[Khloé] Bye, Cuba.

629
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:22,854
Are they good?

630
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,422
Didn't it feel so good, guys,

631
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,125
to be, like, not connected with the world

632
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,362
-and just not have our phones?
-[Khloé] Yeah. I was telling…

633
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,397
I was telling Malika earlier.
When we were leaving,

634
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,833
I was like, the first day, like,
when we got off the plane,

635
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,369
I was like, "Oh, my god!"
Like, there's no service.

636
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,937
-Oh, my god!
-I was a little freaked out.

637
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,773
And that's why everyone's so calm and cool
and, like, relaxed.

638
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,575
[Malika] Yeah. Don't you feel
like it's something

639
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,011
-you guys should do more often?
-[Kourtney] Definitely.

640
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,046
Even just, like,
communicating, like, with,

641
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,347
"What time are we leaving?"

642
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,815
Like, that was, like, a challenge.

643
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,784
Like, nobody was on their phones.

644
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,254
At dinner, everybody was
actually paying attention.

645
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,989
[Malika] We had really
good conversations at dinner.

646
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,324
-[Kourtney] We did.
-Yeah.

647
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,793
-[Malika] Um, so, Cake…
-[Khloé] Huh?

648
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,896
Um, we're heading home.
What are you gonna do about Lamar?

649
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,398
I need to just go home and see.

650
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,667
Like, I don't know
if Lamar's done anything yet.

651
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,834
Yeah.

652
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,703
Hope for the best.

653
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,572
-That's all you can do.
-[Khloé] Yup.

654
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,008
[Kourtney] Does this plane have Wi-Fi?

655
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,411
[upbeat music playing]

656
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,218
{\an8}[Kourtney] <i>We're just doing
a little organizing, you know?</i>

657
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,553
{\an8}<i>What the hell is this?</i>

658
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,055
Oh, my god. Can I have that?

659
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,056
[Kourtney] Yeah.

660
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,559
-Knock yourself out.
-I'm gonna show you what it is.

661
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,894
[Kim] Watch this.

662
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,930
This is, like, a selfie stick
that stays somewhere though.

663
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,633
[playful music playing]

664
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,668
[groans]

665
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,439
[Kourtney] Like, am I ever
gonna use a selfie stick?

666
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,974

-[Kourtney] No. Here, look.

Stop.

So, I'll have literally people,
like, friends of mine call me

676
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:11,329
and be like, "Ugh, was Kanye
so pissed that Kylie did Puma?"

-Yeah.
-People literally ask me.

[Kim] I just wish that my mom spoke
about it with us,

681
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,844
because I feel like
we're such a close family

682
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,380
that we should all be able to communicate

683
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,382
so that we don't step
on each other's toes.

684
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,751
I do see both sides.

685
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,053
[Kim] I definitely see how
Kylie should've done that deal.

686

No, not at all.

693
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,971
so I want to explain to my mom

694
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,174

and just be upfront.

00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,406
-let me talk to somebody."
-You never said--

835
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,941
He had no idea

836
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,343
until the shoot was already happening.

837
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,512
I'm just trying to give my best energy

838
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,382
and do the best job
for everybody that I can.

839
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,050
I was the one who initiated

840
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,319
the conversation in the very beginning.

841
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,187
But you didn't initiate it with him.

842
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,956
You tried to go and get an Adidas deal.

843
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,158
-No, no, no.
-Yes, and at the same time,

844
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,160
he was trying to negotiate
his Adidas deal.

845
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,662
-Yeah, but I didn't know that.
-Let's say, Kendall's with Estée Lauder,

846
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,131
-right?
-Mm-hmm.

847
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,900
I have a new manager,
and my manager decides

848
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,735
to call Estée Lauder to get me a deal.

849
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,270
And you're renegotiating with Kendall.

850
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,540
It could be a big thing,
but it would take a little bit of a dig

851
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,776
if I were to sign a huge deal
with Estée Lauder.

852
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,210
Don't you think it would be shady of me

853
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,313
if I didn't call you to be like,
"Hey, I know you're with Estée Lauder,

854
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,049
I know you've already got that
with Kendall,

855
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,917
but my new team's taking me over there."

856
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,485
You would be like, "Wait. That's weird."

857
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,088
"Why is she gonna, like,
step on Kendall's turf?"

858
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:20,725
Well…

859
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,227
Sometimes, I get ahead of myself too,

860
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,430
and sometimes I forget to communicate

861
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,331
maybe the way that I should.

862
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,368
So, I feel bad, but it wasn't intentional,

863
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,471
and I'm really happy
that things worked out the way they did.

864
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,673
It's perfect,
because Kylie can do her thing.

865
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,742
She's so excited to be with the brand.

866
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,410
The brand's excited to be with her.

867
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,412
And it all worked out for the best.

868
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,914
-Yeah. Totally.
-[Kris] You know?

869
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,550
[Kim] I'm just really glad
that my mom understands

870
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,252
where I'm coming from,
and that, in the future,

871
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:49,821
if something like this happens again,

872
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,389
she's just able to communicate with me.

873
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,791
I mean, we ultimately want
what's best for each other.

874
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:57,528
Like, everybody deserves
to have a very successful life,

875
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,431
if they're willing to work hard,
and it's a good fit.

876
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,034
And my job is to find those opportunities,

877
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,137
you know, like,
Kimberly Cupcakes. [chuckles]

878
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,505
All the things we would do…

879
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,040
-so wild.
-[Kris] Yeah. Yeah.

880
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,212
Well, you know, it's not like
you could sing or dance.

881
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,682
We made the best of it,
but it got us to here.

882
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:18,883
[chuckles softly]

883
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:22,153
[upbeat music playing]

884
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,394
{\an8}[Kris] Hi!

885
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,530
Oh, P, you look so cute!

886
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:36,567
-[Malika] You look fantastic!
-Thank you!

887
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,270
-[Khloé] You look gorgeous.
-Thank you.

888
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,140
[Kris] Look how cute this table looks.

889
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,641
Uh, and there's a band?

890
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,043
-[Khloé] Who made you a martini?
-[Kris] My boyfriend.

891
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,113
[Malika] Hey, Scottie!

892
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,415
Come on out. I've been waiting for you!

893
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,085
We did have such a great time in Cuba,

894
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,221
and I know that my mom
and Scott really felt left out,

895
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:01,459
so Kourt and I throw
a Cuban-themed party at my house,

896
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:05,997
and really get them to feel
that Cuban vibe, like, to a T.

897
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,099
I want them to really think
they're in Cuba.

898
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,635
In Cuba, our phones did not work.

899
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,037
And it was the most amazing experience.

900
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,338
-I'm a doctor right now.
-I understand that.

901
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,873
-I'm on call.
-I'm a doctor.

902
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,209
I would love for you to give me
your phone for 30 minutes.

903
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,343
Okay, take it.

904
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,379
-I love you for this.
-You do? It's fine.

905
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,713
I thought if you gave up a fight,

906
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,781
-like, I could too.
-You're gonna have the best

907
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,383
Cuban experience.

908
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,018
[Khloé] Scott, I need your cell phone.

909
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,520
Food is just being brought out,
if you guys want to sit at the table.

910
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,222
-[Scott] Let's do it!
-Yeah.

911
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:35,226
So, literally, this is
what we ate every single day.

912
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:38,829
[Malika] Rice, beans,
plantains, and chicken.

913
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,798
[Kourtney] Ooh, yeah, P.

914
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,733
-Bring the vibes.
-[Mason] Ooh, yeah, P.

915
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,269
Look at how beautiful this looks.

916
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,272
[Khloé] Kimmy!

917
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,975
Oh, my god!

918
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,844
-That's a really cool dress.
-[Kim] Thanks.

919
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,313
[Khloé] So, you know what?

920
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,715
We just wanted to bring you guys together.

921
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,184
To the people who were
not able to come to Cuba,

922
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,921
we wanted to bring Cuba to you guys.

923
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,089
-[Scott] And we appreciate it.
-[Khloé] So, here we are.

924
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,258
{\an8}-[Kris] Thank you.
-No cell phones.

925
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,727
Mason!

926
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,128
[Mason] This is just pretend.

927
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,231
KoKo planned it
as a certain kind of thing.

928
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,032
-Because I wanted--
-This is all fake?

929
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,802
I want-- Masey, you know
how we got to go to Cuba?

930
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:21,072
I wanted Lovey and everyone
to pretend that they were in Cuba,

931
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:22,306
'cause they couldn't go.

932
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,042
Mase, what was
your favorite part about Cuba?

933
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,478
Having dinner with everyone!

934
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,814
-Aw, that's nice.
-Aw! That's nice, Mase.

935
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,549
[Khloé] See? That's why we're
trying to have dinner here.

936
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,951
Remember the cars that we drove in?

937
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:34,986
Those were awesome.

938
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,420
Did you like the pink one or the red one?

939
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,655
[Mason] Green and red.

940
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,057
-Did you like salsa dancing?
-Uh-huh.

941
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,859
-Legit?
-Da-da-da!

942
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,461
Yeah!

943
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,430
-Go, Mase, go!
-Right?

944
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,332
[Scott] You know, it meant a lot
that Khloé went out of her way

945
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,667
and really made, like,

946
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,769
an amazing authentic Cuban night
at her house for me.

947
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,738
The best part of the night is

948
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,874
Mason telling me all the stories
about the cars in Cuba,

949
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,909
and just watching Kris have fun.

950
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,646
And not everyone was sitting
on their phones, texting away,

951
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,147
emailing, and not really being present.

952
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,916
You know, maybe I didn't get
to go to Cuba,

953
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:09,820
but at least I'm getting to spend
some really nice time with them now.

954
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,956
-[Khloé] Yes!
-[Kris] Oh, wow!

955

00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,194
-Here we go! Here we go!

00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,196

958

Kim, let's turn it up.

959
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:21,832
Get out there.

960
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,036
I actually threw my back out,
so I can't really move.

963
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,676

with these girls?

[Khloé] Oh, P, you're so cute, P.

975
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,455
Maybe our Cuba trip will remind all of us

976
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,491
to take advantage of family time
when we have it.

-[Kris] Arriba, arriba!

-I have no idea.
-[laughter]

982
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,470
I think that's just like, "Hey."

Oye. Okay.

984

00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,077
That's Kylie. Look at her.

1002
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,712
[Khloé] You're not pissed
that Chyna made an emoji

1003
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:15,780
about you?

1004
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,616
Do you still take
your medicine every morning?

1005
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:21,819
Lamar hasn't followed through
recently with so many things.

1006
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,388
He obviously doesn't care.

1007
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,589
[Khloé] No.
