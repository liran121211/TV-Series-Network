do you know how to play this game?

Oh, yeah, you're a Jenner.

5
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:19,519
I feel like you're good, so…

6
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,721
I'm really not.
Like, who do you think I play with?

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,124
-Ah!
-Lamar?

Oh, it still bounced!

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,132
Wait. Why do you have all that cabbage?

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,335
This? Because I need
to stop breastfeeding.

12
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,537
[Kourtney] So, is it on you right now?

13
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,839
Yeah. Green is the color I should put on,

14
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,074
or does it not matter?

15
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,743
I think I put green,
but I only tried it once,

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,780
and then, I decided
not to stop breastfeeding,

17
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,415
and then, I was done with the cabbage.

18
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,050
Wait. I kind of, like,
I was in the shower today,

19
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,117
and milk came out,

20
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,353
and then, I was, "[bleep],
should I start again?"

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,587
-Can you?
-[Kourtney] I would.

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,391
[Kim] Two months ago,

23
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,293
I gave birth to my son, Saint.

24
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,230
He is the most beautiful boy
I've ever seen.

25
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,133
But I'm not gonna lie.
Like, it is so hard.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,668
My mom used to always say,

27
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,204
"One is one, two is 20."

28
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,073
And I really do feel that way.

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,642
Being a mom is so tiring.

That's why Kim and Kanye
are together, guys,

36
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,488
because they fall asleep
at the drop of a dime.

37
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,590
[Khloé] I think Kim fakes it
half the time.

00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,626
Here! Put these [bleep] things
on your tits

39

-I have them on, you freak!

[Kris] How are you? You look so skinny.

51

[Khloé] My god, people keep
saying that to me,

52
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,363
and I don't know why.
I just ate a bag of chips.

-Oh, my god.
-You look cute.

Well, eat another one.

Thanks. This is so great.

-Is Lamar here?
-No.

57
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,906
[Khloé] So much has happened
in the past few months.

58
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,676
Lamar's recovery has been
nothing short of a miracle.

59
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,913
Right now, they have
to stabilize all of his organs.

60
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,517
They don't know yet how,
how he's gonna respond to all of it.

61
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,253
Khloé can be at the hospital every day,

62
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,054
-and maybe still sleep at home.
-Well, I don't think she was

63
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,556
-leaving his side.
-Yeah.

64
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,259
[Khloé] I got told on Tuesday

65
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,227
that he will be discharged this Friday.

66
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,063
I'm very blessed and very happy
but it's just horrible timing

67
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,866
because I have a whole New York press trip

68
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,068
that's been planned for ages now.

69
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,538
And I feel like I have
to get him into a new house

70
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,239
before I go to New York.

71
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,707

-[Kris] Yeah.

the walk-through with us.

-[Khloé] Good.

78

[Kris] Knowing Khloé,
she probably has this

79
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,124
all organized in her brain, too.

80
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,526
Everything should be more oversized.

81
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,328
-Right.
-Because he's seven feet.

-Yeah.

89
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,108
to help me install Lamar's house,

90
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,877
and help me find furniture for it.

91

92

especially for a seven-foot-tall man

93
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,319

on such a short amount of time.

-I like those.
-Yeah, those are great, Khloé.

-We're really excited.
-[Kris] Comfortable.

I'm going to New York,
and so, I was, like, frantic,

99

'cause I wanna get all this stuff done,

100
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,030
but now I'm like, "Okay.

101
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,198
I can go to New York. I feel better."

102
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,666
I'll be there for you, Khloé.

103
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,268
But if anyone could get this job done,

104
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,336

to look really nice.

-Yeah.
-Just so, you know,

110
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,946
if you're in an environment
that looks good, you feel good,

111
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,015
and I want him to feel like he has a home

112
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,116
for his journey of, like,

113
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,484
-constantly getting better.
-Yeah.

and it's too late.

for a little bit for everybody,

and, you know, it's disappointing

155

00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,484
-this much closet when they--
-I don't want a girlfriend.

175
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,252
Whenever, in 80 years.

176
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,353
[Scott] Ew.

177
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,289
I'm not thinking about that, to be honest.

178
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:34,727
Kourtney will always be
a huge motivation in my life.

179
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:38,131
I mean, no matter whether
we're together or not,

180
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,166
she's still was with me for ten years,

181
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,234
and, you know,

182
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,035
we've been through
a lot of things together.

183
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,303
How serene is this?

184
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,806
You get the outside
so you never feel depressed.

185
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,341
[Khloé] Look how beautiful that is.

186
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,475
[Scott] Yeah, I'm still depressed.

187
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,212
How are you depressed?

188
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,681
Because I'm single,
and I live here by myself.

189
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,785
[Scott] I fell in love
with the house that I'm in…

190
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,788
until I actually moved in

191
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,524
and realized that
it's way, way, way too big

192
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,327
for a single human being living alone.

193
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,896
You know, I'm sure
a lot of people wish these

194
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:10,997
were their problems,

195
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:14,300
but it's a drop lonely
living alone in a big house.

196
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,569
[Khloé] I'm so excited about this.

197
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,837
[Scott] Get your food on.

198
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,605
-Is Bob still living with you, or what?
-Mm-hm.

199
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,841
But do you wanna hear the craziest story?

200
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,510
Rob was asking what time would I be home,

201
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,312
and I got home 30 minutes earlier

202
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,448
than the time that I told him
I was coming home,

203
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,350
so I walked in on him
with Blac Chyna at my house.

204
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,585
Excuse me?

205
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,788
[Khloé] There's alcohol everywhere.

206
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,490
He's having the time of his life.

207
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,624
I don't need [bleep].

208
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,227
Don't you dare make me feel uncomfortable

209
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,595
in my own home.

210
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,965
[Khloé] I don't really care who Rob dates,

211
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,468
but having Chyna over at my house

212
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,503
without my knowledge is disrespectful.

213
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,039
Why can't he be honest
with me and communicate?

214
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:58,478
Because Robert knows
Chyna's Tyga's ex-girlfriend,

215
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,814
and I just don't want that drama
in my personal space.

216
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,917
I told him, I said,
"You've burned your last bridge."

217
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,119
Yeah, really, what a [bleep] nightmare

218
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,188
-everything has become.
-Dude, everything!

219
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,356
I'm like, "What did I do?"

220
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,624
[sighs]

221
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,961
[upbeat music]

222
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,934
{\an8}[Kourtney] <i>You wanna take it on my phone?</i>

223
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,336
I can do it on yours.

224
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,539
PS, I did a thing on you on my app today.

225
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,940
-[Monica] You did?
-So,

226
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,742
{\an8}I feel like, we should take a picture

227
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,210
{\an8}and then, like, on my app, like,

228
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,746
I could Instagram it to, like, link to it.

229
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,781
I love this as an option for <i>Ellen,</i>

230
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,383
but I brought some other stuff.

231
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,085
Was there anything else
of your personal stuff

232
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,319
-you wanna try?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

233
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,024
I am appearing
on <i>The Ellen Show</i> next week.

234
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,260
Now that my app is launching,

235
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,030
I love to be able to talk
about the positive things in my life,

236
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,066
but I haven't done any press for anything

237
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,102
in about three years.

238
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,938
I haven't talked about anything
since Scott and I broke up,

239
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,907
and I'm so nervous.

240
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,775
[Monica] Cute.

241
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,977
You look very badass in this outfit.

242
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,078
-[Kylie] Hello?
-This one.

243
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,146
-Hi.
-[Kourtney] Hi.

244
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,549
-Oh, my god, what is that?
-[squeals]

245
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,750
[Kylie] This is Piño.

246
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,018
Kylie, you didn't tell me

247
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,820
that you have to dance on <i>Ellen</i>
when you walk out.

248
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,289
-I don't dance on <i>Ellen.</i>
-[Monica] She did.

249
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,790
[Kourtney] I'm doing it on Thursday.

250
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,392
I'm like, "Why did I agree to this?"

251
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,593
I didn't know that you have to dance.

252
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,661
[Monica] You kinda dance.

253
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,795
-You kinda move a little.
-Do you get to pick a song?

254
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,497
-I was so nervous.
-I'm so nervous.

255
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,799
-Why am I nervous?
-I don't know why.

256
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,235
Literally, Monica was there.
I don't remember what I said

257
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,637
for the first, like, 60 seconds.

258
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,607
-[Monica] And she did so good.
-I don't remember.

259
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,509
[Kourtney] Like, do I take a shot before?

260
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,480
I haven't ever seen Kourtney
this nervous for anything,

261
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,882
but I know exactly how it feels

262
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,684
'cause I was just as nervous for <i>Ellen.</i>

263
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,719
And I'm just gonna be there for her.

264
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,822
Do I literally not dance at all
when I walk out?

265
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,057
-[Kylie] No.
-Like, I just don't move?

266
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,658
I just walked and was, like…

267
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,961
-I'm not gonna be like…
-[Kylie] No.

268
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,363
I mean, it would be
kind of funny if you did that.

269
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,766
I could be like, "Hey."
[chuckling]

270
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,102
-That's cute. You don't have to.
-Like, I just think it's like…

271
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,270
humiliating.

272
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,705
For real.

273
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,040
[upbeat music]

274
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,085
-[Scott] Chop-chop.
-Hi.

275
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,087
How are you, honey?

276
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,289
-Mwah. You look handsome.
-Thanks. You look nice.

277
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,124
Thanks for inviting me out to lunch.

278
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,560
-Does this mean you're buying?
-Sure.

279
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,228
I'm so excited.

280
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,797
[Scott] Kris has honestly been

281
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,900
really, really, really supportive of me

282
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,002
throughout all of this.

283
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,104
And, truthfully,
if the tables were turned,

284
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,139
you know, I don't know how I would be

285
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,974
towards a guy like me.

286
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,309
And she's been amazing.

287
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,178
So, you know, it's been
a real blessing for me, so…

288
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,314
It's pretty unbelievable.

289
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,584
[Kris] "Devils on horseback."

290
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,887
"Ceviche. Crispy California Cactus." Ooh!

291
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,555
"Chicken sauté lettuce cups."

292
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,757
Yeah, that sounds nice.

293
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,425
"Fried avocado"?

294
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,995
"Chicken wonton, peanut, sesame, citrus."

295
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,498
I'm gonna have the baby kale Caesar.

296
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,000
-Congratulations.
-Vegan… Thank you.

297
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,002
"Vegan-Caesar dressing,
almond, gluten-free--"

298
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,537
[Scott] I'm not gonna lie,
it's very difficult

299
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,773
for me to try to look through the menu

300
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,808
if you read everything out loud.

301
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,544
-I'm trying to find something.
-Okay, sorry.

302
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,346
So, wait, have you eaten here before?

303
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,314
Yeah, Kourtney and I used
to come here once in a while.

304
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,450
Aw. That's sad.

305
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,185
She's not dead.

306
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,319
[Kris chuckles]

307
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,455
So tell me about you.

308
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,158
[Scott] Physically, fine.
Emotionally, I'm always [bleep].

309
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,460
But I love the new house,
and it's gorgeous,

310
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,062
and I'm happy that I'm near you guys.

311
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,663
-Yeah.
-It makes me feel a little bit more safe,

312
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,533
and I like that I have,
you know, it's gated and…

313
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,201
-I like you're behind gates.
-It's definitely…

314
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,871
changed my life for the better
in the sense of, um…

315
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,740
I see the kids every single day.

316
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,642
Today they'll come over
and have dinner with me

317
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,144
-and watch a movie and…
-Nice. And you're so close.

318
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,813
They picked out their own bedrooms.

319
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,214
-Mm-hm.
-But…

320
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,249
You know, everybody keeps saying, like,

321
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,519
"Just wrap yourself up with work
and you'll feel better."

322
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,288
And I'm just like, "I've tried that."

323
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,157
Like, I just really just wanna feel decent

324
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,560
and be happy and take care of the kids.

325
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,028
[Kris] You know what? I think,

326
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,397
you seem to be making really good choices.

327
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,033
And you're putting your kids first,

328
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,201
which is amazing.

329
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,303
You're gonna get to a place of happiness

330
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,573
where it's just gonna feel,
all of a sudden, really good.

331
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,241
[Scott] We'll see where things go.

332
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,909
I don't know. I mean,

333
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,413
I'm a 32-year-old man that lives alone.

334
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:32,284
You know, in the back of my mind,

335
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,453
Kourtney's always there.

336
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,455
So all I can do

337
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,491
is hope one day things fall into place

338
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,594
and I can be able to raise
my kids together with her,

339
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,095
but, you know, at the end of the day,

340
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,063
I still love Kourtney,

341
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,531
and that's what's important to me,

342
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,699
and it always will be.

{\an8}[Khloé] <i>What are you doing? You freak.</i>

345
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,580
I just, like, was looking
at my old pictures

346
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,948
on Instagram last night,

347
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,184
and I just posted some throwbacks.

348
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,752
Look how cool I was.

349
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,754
You're not cool anymore?

350
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,523
-[Kylie] No, I'm cooler.
-Oh, yeah.

351
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,692
You can't pull out your eyelashes

352
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,727
while we're having a conversation

353
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,862
'cause it's really hard to look at you.

354
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,532
-It's gross.
-Okay, but do you see that one

355
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,599
-that keeps falling in my eye?
-Yeah.

356
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,967
-Why?
-I don't know.

357
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,002
-That's gross.
-I've tried everything.

358
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,271
Curling it. I was gonna cut it out
with scissors this morning.

359
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,907
I've had one that was coming in my…

360
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,742
like, down, for a good year.

361
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,477
And guess what I finally had to do.

362
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,512
-Cut it?
-I had to tweeze it.

363
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,315
To tweeze a [bleep] eyelash
from your eyeball?

364
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,483
I'm ruthless.

365
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,651
-Ooh!
-Ugh!

366
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,622
I'm so overwhelmed 'cause I have to… pack.

367
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,458
-Are you excited? For your tour?
-[Khloé laughs]

368
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,227
It's not, like, a tour, just New York.

369
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,261
Gone for three days.

370
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,932
[Khloé] I'm leaving for New York
for my press tour

371
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,667
and this is the first week
Lamar is gonna be home

372
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,568
from the hospital.

373
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,470
And it is really causing me
a ton of anxiety,

374
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,540
and I think my only comfort right now

375
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,375
is knowing that my mom
will be by Lamar's side

376
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,010
and there to help me with whatever I need.

377
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,745
[Khloé] I'm kind of not comfortable,

378
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,081
you know, leaving LA right now.

379
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,382
I don't have a caregiver,

380
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,017
I don't have any of that,
so I'm just, like,

381
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,453
I have to leave him
with people that I trust.

382
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,621
Yeah.

383
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,856
'Cause he can't sleep alone or anything.

384
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,624
He doesn't have a phone
or anything like that,

385
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,992
like, in case something happens.

386
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,694
That's okay. Going to New York.

387
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,462
So I leave Tuesday.

388
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,597
It's a lot.

389
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,898
I know, it's a lot.

390
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,132
Don't freak me out more.

392
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,009
{\an8}-[woman 1] Hello.
-[Kris] Hi.

393
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,811
{\an8}This looks so nice.

394
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,312
Welcome to the Wellness Kitchen.

395
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,647
{\an8}My name is Erika Wong.

396
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,983
{\an8}I'm one of the registered dieticians here.

397
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,619
Today we're gonna focus
on kid-friendly recipes.

398
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,721
But really our whole philosophy in here

399
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,756
is about plant-based nutrition.

400
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,858
And that's how the kids eat,
that's how Kourtney

401
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,460
-likes them to eat anyway.
-Oh, trust me, I get it.

402
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,494
-So, yeah.
-I know.

403
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,963
[Scott] Kris and I have decided

404
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,199
we are going to take
a little cooking class.

405
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,301
Kourt's over-the-top extreme

406
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,703
with the whole gluten-free, organic.

407
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,372
She's like, "I don't think it's right

408
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,640
that he eats Cap'n Crunch there

409
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,609
because he wants to come over there
just so he can eat Cap'n Crunch."

410
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,177
So I'm trying to do everything I can.

411
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,579
[Kris] Yeah.

412
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,281
So I want to at least

413
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,716
be able to supply healthy food
for the kids

414
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,851
when they're at my house,

415
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,487
and I mean, I think Kourtney
will appreciate it.

416
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,189
I feel like I'm cutting up
somebody's body.

417
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,392
-Scott.
-Oh, my. [laughs]

418
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,193
[Scott] To be able to cut something, it's…

419
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,962
-pretty proud of myself.
-Good. That's really good.

420
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,330
-You did a good job.
-Yeah, thank you.

421
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,400
So we're moving on to turkey meatballs.

422
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,834
-[Kris] Meatballs.
-Oh, meatballs. That sounds fun.

423
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,470
So garlic has a tendency to burn.

424
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,906
-Never turn your back on garlic.
-Right.

425
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,142
Never go against the family, Kris.

426
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,311
Just gotta get in there like that.

427
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,012
[Scott] Oh. I got one meatball
stuck in there.

428
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,914
-[Kris] Okay.
-[Scott] This is a lot of work.

429
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,049
[Kris] It's not really.

430
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,318
This is nothing compared
to a lot of recipes.

431
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,987
I'm from New York.
I'm just so used to just ordering in.

432
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,923
I know, but it's gonna be
so much healthier for the kids.

433
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,358
-Okay. I know.
-And Kourtney's

434
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,960
gonna be really happy.

435
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:05,097
[Kris] I think Scott is finding his way.

436
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,767
And I think he realizes
that he messed up a good thing.

437
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,604
He was with Kourtney for the last decade,

438
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,306
and that's a big change for anybody.

439
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,977
And all I wanna do
is just be here for him right now.

440
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,611
His kids are my grandchildren.

441
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,747
So, yeah, I love Scott a lot.

442
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,650
Oh, the cauliflower is amazing.

443
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,318
Cauliflower is so good.

444
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,054
-I love the chicken.
-Mm, mm, mm.

445
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,557
Well, this could be your new, like, hobby.

446
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,858
No, I love it. I mean, I--

447
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,027
[Kris] You could become, like,
one of the biggest chefs in the world.

448
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,296
I… I don't… I don't think
that's gonna happen.

449
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,331
But I'll settle for the smallest.

450
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,933

-I'm good. Thank you.

456
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,289

[mellow music]

463
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,240
[Khloé] It is really, really hard
being away from Lamar.

464
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,409
All I'm thinking about is,
"Is Lamar okay?"

465
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,344
"Is he eating at the right time?"

466
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,879
"Is he being taken care of?"

467
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,313
But I have to get it together.

468
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,015

Um, just the Lamar questions.

00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,449
Obviously, I know I have
to talk about it, but that's…

487
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,051
I'm not one to talk about that stuff.

00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,587
I was glad that you opened up
more than I thought you would.

489
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,456
[Joyce] And those are his
kind of questions all the time.

490
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,792
But I just, I don't like
talking about someone else.

491
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,462
Like, that's for them to talk about.

492
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,798
[Khloé] Howard and everyone
else today keeps asking me

493
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,066
about my relationship with Lamar.

494
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,635
How am I doing? Am I back together?

495
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,305
And like, I just… I don't know.

496
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,241
[Khloé] It's just a really
difficult thing to answer.

497
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,677
-[Andy] <i>To begin the year with Caitlyn…</i>
-[Khloé] <i>Yeah.</i>

498
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,812
…and end the year with Lamar,

499
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,848
{\an8}do you think you and Lamar
could ever get back together?

500
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,816
{\an8}You obviously loved him very much.

501
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,354
I've learned to say, "Never say never,"

502
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,723
because if you would've asked me
two years ago

503
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,692
if this is what the events
would have happened in my life,

504
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,893
-I would've said, "Never."
-[Andy] Right.

505
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,661
But now, I can't say that.

506
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,498
[Khloé] I love Lamar,
and we've been through so much,

507
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,234
but there's so much more
that has to be resolved.

508
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,936
There's a lot of hurt and things
that need to be fixed.

509
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:58,871
I don't know.

510
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:02,107
I'm figuring out

{\an8}[Jen] I mean, how gorge do you look?

[Kris] Oh, my goodness,
everybody has so much energy.

00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,126
[Kourtney] Well, I don't.

516

-I drink this calming tea at home.
-Wait…

517
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,429
I was yawning the whole car ride up.

518
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,664
I almost fell asleep.

519
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,399
[Kris] You're not supposed
to have calming tea

520
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,967
before you do <i>The Ellen Show</i>.

521
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,436
Why? I thought I needed to calm down.

522
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,438
I was like,
"I'm gonna have a heart attack."

523
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,874
No, you are gonna do great.
Why are you so nervous?

-You've done a million talk shows.
-[Kourtney] I know.

525
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,711
[Kris] So, just relax.

526
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,648
Just go out there and tell them
how much you love your mom.

527
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,483
That'll calm your nerves.

528
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,353
I think I'm so nervous
to do <i>The Ellen Show</i>

529
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,889
because there's been, you know,
a lot going on

530
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,391
with everybody in our family,

531
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,526
and it's like, if you say the wrong thing,

532
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,928
everyone gets mad.

533
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,496
And I just… you know,

534
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,665
I never know what someone's gonna ask.

[Kris] Kourtney is just getting back
into the swing of things

545
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,521
into the best shape of her life,

546
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,022
and she's the old Kourtney again.

547
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,825
It's kind of cute that she's so nervous.

548
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,293
[Kris] But she looks great.

-a little bit insecure today.
-[Kourtney] No.

{\an8}Well, we're not together.

{\an8}I feel like every day is different,

-[Kourtney] What do you think?

00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,340
Wasn't the beginning, like, so bad?

573
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,042
[Kris] No. It was fun.

574
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,678
{\an8}I thought you just seemed
so cool, calm, collected.

Well, I don't even know
what the [bleep] I said.

586

{\an8}[Khloé] Well, I wanted to call you

587
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,241
to tell you about these texts
I got from Caitlyn.

588
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,311
She was like, "What happened
to family sticking together?"

589
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,813
[Khloé] I am on this New York press trip,

590
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,283
and I am getting insane,
aggressive texts from Caitlyn.

591
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,319
It all stems from
my Howard Stern interview,

592
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,387
but I said nothing inappropriate,

593
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,757
I said nothing that was new information,

594
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,059
everything has been said before.

595
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,228
And I said, "You slaughtered my mother

596
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,730
and you have the nerve to say,

597
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,832
"What happened
to family sticking together?'"

598
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,401
I said, "You jumped that ship
as soon as you did Diane Sawyer,

599
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,371
and you, like, attacked my mom!"

600
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,273
But instead, tells me to get a life

601
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,774
and to shut up, and all this,

602
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,310
I'm like, "You shut up
and you get a [bleep] life!"

603
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,446
Mom, can you handle this?

[Kris] <i>Yes.</i>

605
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,884
If Caitlyn were to actually
listen to my interview,

606
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,754
she would know that nothing bad
or harmful was said.

607
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,756
She could tell me to [bleep] off
all she wants,

with her, I'm done.

I don't think Khloé
would ever say anything

to intentionally hurt anybody,

638

Turn away. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

681
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,017
[Kendall] It's so fun
to have our lines come out

682
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,652
every once in a while and grow with us

683
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,854
and to get more mature every time.

684
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,956
-Bye, guys. Thank you so much.
-Bye.

685
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,157
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

686

[phone ringing]

687
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,997
{\an8}-Hey, Kim.
-[Kendall] What did he give her?

688
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,199
-[Kylie] Kendall, an iPad.
-A big one? The massive one?

689
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,267
Yes, shut [bleep] up.

690
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,869
I gave that to him for Christmas.

691
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,137
Did you give him a keyboard or no?

692
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,506
Yes! A keyboard, a pen, and an iPad.

693
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,574
For Christmas.

694
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,442
Kim, you're gonna die right now.

695
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,077
He regifted

696
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,579
-Kendall's birthday gift.
-[Kendall] I'm so mad.

697
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,547
I would've given that to someone else.

698
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,115
[Kendall] Rob is dating someone

699
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,284
that has kind of had
a bad history with my family,

700
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,653
and he fully regifted my gift.

701
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,890
On top of it, it's so annoying
to find out through social media

702
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,258
because his girlfriend posted it.

703
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,393
Like, there's some things
that just aren't cool,

704
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,861
and I don't think this is very cool.

705
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,264
[Kendall] I'm gonna tell him
to give it back to me.

706
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,832
[Kylie] Kendall, you need
to call him right now.

707
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,067
Call him right now and say,
"I want it back,"

708
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,368
and see what he says.

709
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,503
[line rings]

710
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,972
Hi.

711
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,641
{\an8}Yo, um, can I have my iPad back?

712
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,610
{\an8}[Rob speaks indistinctly]

713
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,845
{\an8}No, for… Bible, I want my iPad,

714
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,213
my pen, and my keyboard back.

715
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,748
You tell him, I want them right now.

716
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,317
What?

717
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,486
[Rob] <i>What pen?</i>

718
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:05,156
It came with an iPad, a pen,
and a keyboard,

719
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,458
and I want it all back

720
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,093
because if you're not gonna use it,

721
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,695
I have someone who actually
really is dying for it.

722
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,197
One, I'm annoyed.

723
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,967
Two, I'm actually hurt
that you regifted my [bleep] gift

724
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,902
that I went out of the way to give you.

725
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,337
[mouths]
Oh, my god.

726
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,407
[Rob] <i>That's the first time you've ever
gotten me a gift in your entire life.</i>

727
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,109
Why are you being so defensive?

728
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,012
[Rob] <i>You're hilarious.
Buy it yourself, you moron.</i>

729
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,079
Send me the link.

730
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,048
Send me the link, bro. Send me the link.

731
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,650
[beeps]

732
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,118
[Kylie] He knows he's wrong.
You should just say,

733
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,319
"You know you're in the wrong."

734
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:36,755
[Kendall] Ungrateful.

735
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,862
[upbeat music]

736
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,668
[Kris] Oh, it smells good.

737
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,604
-Hi.
-[Scott] Hi.

738
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,772
How are you?

739
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,907
-I'm excited, is what I am.
-I've never…

740
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,742
-I've never done this before.
-Stop.

741
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,678
-I think Kourt's coming, too.
-Oh, she is?

742
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:00,845
[Scott] I'm going to have a dinner party

743
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,313
-at my house.
-Okay.

744
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,715
I want to invite the whole family over.

745
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,817
I wanna make pretend
I'm running a real household.

746
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,018
Okay.

747
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,156
I know how important it is for Scott

748
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,524
to spend time with Kourtney,

749
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,393
but hopefully, he'll realize that

750
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,396
it's just not about improving his life

751
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,798
or making things better,

752
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,067
so he can get back
into Kourtney's good graces.

753
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,568
He needs to figure things out

754
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,537
because he wants to make
his own life better

755
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,238
and improve his own self.

756
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,607
You know what, your house
is kind of Cape Cod,

757
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,743
so, like, these navy and white towels.

758
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,144
-Like, this in the kitchen?
-[Kris] Yeah.

759
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,279
[Kourtney] Hi.

760
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,014
[gasps]

761
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,315
-Hey.
-Well, look who it is.

762
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,650
It's Buford.

763
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,618
-Hey…
-[Kris] How are you?

764
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,520
I'm having the best time.

765
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,422
Scott, do you like these mixing bowls?

766
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,457
They're really cute.

767
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,826
[Kourtney] Did you get white towels or no?

768
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,461
-We need to get the white.
-She went blue…

769
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,362
-I would get rid of the blue.
-She's…

770
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,497
She's a tough cookie

771
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,232
-you're talking about here.
-Goddang.

772
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,366
I do trust her.

773
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,268
She did run my life for 11 years.

774
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,772
[Kourtney] When it comes to Scott,

775
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,273
I'm not looking

776
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,143
to get back together any time soon.

777
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,345
I don't have specific boundaries set,

778
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,215
but coming to help him pick out stuff

779
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,083
for his kitchen in his new house

780
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,153
as a friend, like,
I'm totally okay with that,

781
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,224
and I don't feel like
I'm giving any false hope.

782
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,859
[Kris] We need a knife set, Kourtney.

783
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,861
Could you help him pick out a knife set?

784
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,162
[Kourtney] Personally,

785
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,898
I don't like keeping
a knife set on the counter,

786
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,666
because I feel like people can grab them

787
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,168
-or the kids can grab them.
-I agree.

788
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,703
-I think they should be in the drawer.
-Okay.

789
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,804
Do you like this?

790
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,240
This is gonna make you look like
more of a home

791
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,474
because you're gonna have a teakettle.

792
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,911
I mean, I kind of wanted
Kourtney's opinion a little bit.

793
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,547
Personally, my teakettle is from here.

794
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,449
That one's cooler than the one I have.

795
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:47,185
I just wanna have what's normal
because at some point

796
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,087
I wanna have all of you guys over
for dinner

797
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,288
at the new house.

798
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:51,523
-So we need knives…
-That's what I'm trying

799
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,991
-to accomplish.
-[Kourtney] That's cool.

800
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,359
Okay, I'm gonna go. Bye, guys.

801
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,894
-I'm going to Khloé's.
-Why?

802
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,263
-[Scott] You're not even done.
-[Kourtney] We are done.

803
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,064
I don't have all day.
I have to meet Khloé.

804
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,771
[Scott] Kourt came,
she stopped by, said hi.

805
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,439
All I wanted was kind of, her two cents,

806
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:11,009
and maybe we got one, not two.
In the back of my mind,

807
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,877
I want everybody to be proud of me,

808
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,479
and I want my kids to be proud of me,

809
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,680
I want Kourtney to be proud of me.

810
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,515
[Scott] But she seems to not really care,

811
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,450
so I'm a little disappointed.

812
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,920
-Thanks for coming by.
-Thanks for helping out, kid.

813
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,755
-It's been really fun.
-[Kourtney] You're welcome.

-Thank you, yes.

[Kris] Yeah, really thoughtful, so…

821
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,781

822
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,782
You're pregnant.

If you're pregnant,
I think I might slit my wrists.

824

-What?

[Kris] Oh, my god. She showed you?

833
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,936
[Kourtney] Can I show you mine later?

834
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,037
What do you show?

835
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,139
You lay down on your back
and, like, bust it wide open?

836
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,976
No, I was sitting on the toilet,
and I just took a mirror,

837
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,178
and I said, "Stand here
and look in the mirror."

838
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,881
Come on, you guys, do you have
to just talk like this?

839
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:23,982
You weren't raised like this.

-You can't just--
-No, we just have

851
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,508
to stop babying him and step back.

852
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,582
[Khloé] Robert has left
the premises of my house

853
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,183
and moved in with,

854
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,486
I guess, his girlfriend, Blac Chyna.

855
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,321
I don't know where they stay,

856
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,822
I don't what they… I don't know anything.

857
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,125
[Kylie] He's asked Stone
if his house is still for sale

858
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,559
right next door to Chyna's.

859
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,628
[Kourtney] What?

860
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,931
He's trying to buy the house
next door to her.

861
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,599
[Kris] Girls, you know,

862
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,568
he can't find his way right now.
He's lost.

863
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,405
Are you paying
for his down payment, Cruella?

864
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,106
[tense music]

865
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,275
You're calling me Cruella?

866
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,178
You better not be paying
for his down payment.

867
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,212
He doesn't deserve it.

868
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,015
[Khloé] You work so hard for your money,
and you need to enjoy your money.

869
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,083
-Yeah.
-I agree.

870
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,285
Well, first of all, I wouldn't
buy a house for someone.

871
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,988
I would buy a house for myself
as an investment.

872
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,090
-[Khloé] And let him live in it.
-[Kris] Well, somebody

873
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,191
-would have to pay rent.
-Same thing, don't.

874
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,426
We're not stupid, so stop.

875
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,593
I'm not stupid either.

876
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,165
You should not be paying for your son

877
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:50,168
that is almost 30 years old
to buy a house.

878
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,171
[Khloé] Drop him.

879
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,039
Cut the cord.

880
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,876
[Kris] You guys can judge me all day long.

881
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,378
I came here to have a nice dinner,

882
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,313
so just, everybody, relax.

883
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,815
You… you all have to have somebody

884
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,450
to blame and criticize.

885
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,518
Instead of saying, "What's the problem…"

886
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,888
The problem is you. You. Yes, it is.

887
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,690
No, all of you can [bleep] off,

888
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,826
and go think of something else
to talk about.

889
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:18,196
I've seen you guys through
so much [bleep] that you do

890
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,131
that I have to [bleep] put up with.

891
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,833
"I'm married for 72 days."

892
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:22,900
Really? That was normal.

893
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,036
I mean, the [bleep]
we've all gone through,

894
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,639
you guys can do anything
you want, and it's okay,

895
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,108
and I'm supposed to accept it all.

896
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,176
And I'm gonna do the same thing for him.

897
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,811
So stop judging me.

I haven't been here, yet…

-[Kris] Stop it.
-No, I've been waiting.

909
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,715
[Kris] Look at this room.

910
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,051
[Khloé] This looks so nice and so comfy.

911
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,986
And we made this specially for the house.

912
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,321
-Cool, no way!
-This is all manufactured by us.

913
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,123
-[Kris] What?
-[Khloé] This room is so nice.

914
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,358
[Kris] Oh, my god.

915
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,393
I love how it just feels peaceful.

916
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,561
I love the art.

917
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,996
-I love the lamps.
-[Khloé] I love it all.

918
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,965
I absolutely love Lamar's house.

919
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:32,570
[Khloé] I think it is just clean
and serene and comfortable.

920
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:33,871
It was a quick turnaround.

921
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,473
-Forty-eight hours.
-Go for it.

922
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,442
[Khloé] I think it's so incredible

923
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,210
that even after our huge fight last night,

924
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,711
my mom is still here helping me

925
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:43,014
put the finishing touches
on Lamar's house.

926
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,483
And I might not always show

927
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,919
my appreciation as well as I should,

928
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,487
but I do appreciate my mom.

929
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:52,657
[Khloé] I know she goes above and beyond
in everything she does,

930
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,826
and I know how much work all of this was

931
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,360
to get Lamar's house together.

932
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,595
I'm incredibly grateful,

933
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,030
and I really don't know
what I would do without her.

934
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,165
-Mom.
-[Kris] Hmm?

935
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,101
[Khloé] I just wanna say
I love you so much

936
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,503
and thank you for helping me do this.

937
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,439
Hold on. Coming around this big island.

938
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,641
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

939
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,009
And thank you.

00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,678
-That was fun.
-For always being so supportive

941
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,346
and just getting [bleep] done.

942
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,515
I mean, without you,
I don't know what I would do.

943
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,617
And we're all very
verbally abusive to you,

944
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:20,985
and I think we need to stop doing that.

945
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,186
Me too.

946
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,423
We did it. He's home.

947
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,258
This is like a miracle.

948
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,594
Truly is.

949
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,862
-You gonna start crying?
-Yeah.

Why?

951
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,598
Because it's a miracle that he's here.

952
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,666
-Okay.
-And that we're at this step.

That's my text.

957
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,476
I figure if I hear a train,

958
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,378
it might encourage me to go somewhere.

959
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,147
Oh, we should take a train trip

960
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,782
and have, like, our own car
and have lunch…

961

-The train.
-Mm.

-It sounds good, though.
-Mm-hmm.

[upbeat music]

965
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,232
{\an8}[Khloé] I'm having a really hard time

966
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,734
communicating today.

967
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,802
How do you say "maneurisms"?

00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:12,803
"Maneurisms"?

00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,105

-How do you say it?
-"Maneurisms"?

972
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,142
[Khloé] I said "maneurisms."

973
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,512
You know what word Mom says
that drives me insane?

974
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,780
"Poy-trit."

975
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,215
[laughter]

976
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,283
[Kim] Pretty yeah, she does.

977
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,085
-But is that true, is that how you say it?
-What?

978
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,487
-I say "portrait."
-Portrait.

979
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,755
[Khloé] Portrait. Say it again?

980
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,256
Mom says "poy-trit."

[laughter]

982
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,693
-That's not normal.
-[Kim] Yeah.

983
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,729
[Khloé] You know what?
I feel really bad for Mom.

984
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,097
-Why?
-I feel like there's always drama

985
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,933
with one of us and it just sucks.

986
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,769
And to be a mom that's so supportive

987
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,572
-and so hands-on can't be easy.
-With all of us.

988
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,739
Yeah, with all of us.

989
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,945
My mom has actually been super hands-on

990
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,680
in all of our lives.

991
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,881
[Khloé] And I think we all forget

992
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,117
how many people she takes care of.

993
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,953
She's helped me with Lamar's move

994
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,254
and all this Caitlyn drama.

995
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,456
And so, like, now that Rob's
trying to figure out his life

996
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,924
and now that he's dating Chyna,

997
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,893
and the divide with everybody
in the family,

998
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,661
it has to be hard on Mom,

999
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,663
and we can't ask her to pick sides.

1000
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,266
[Khloé] Even if I don't agree
with what Rob's doing,

1001
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,202
I know my mom is just being Rob's mom,

1002
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,238
and she's doing exactly
what she would do for me

1003
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,639
or for Kim or Kourt.

1004
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,642
And I think we just have to be
way more aware

1005
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,078
and appreciative of everything
she does for us.

1006
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,514
I mean, we might not agree
with everything,

1007
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,618
but, you know, we know
she's coming from a good place,

1008
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,554
and it is her son,
so let's just, like, back off.

1009
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,723
-Yeah.
-I can back off.

00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,384
to Scott's house.

1022
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,886
[Kourtney] I'm not…
I just, like, I can't do it.

1023
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,424
[Kourtney] We were supposed to have

1024
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,726
a nice family dinner together with Scott,

1025
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,927
but he's gone missing.

1026
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,030
You know, there's definitely times

1027
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,365
when he'll take a few steps forward,

1028
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,000
and then a few steps backwards,

1029
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,835
and it's just, like, this cycle

1030
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,204
that has been going on for years.

1031
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:30,174
And that's why I finally had
to step out of it.

1032
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,811
Well, I haven't seen him,
but I'm happy to Facetime him.

1033
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,046
[Kim] That's crazy.

1034
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,814
Thought we were having a shindig
at his house.

1035
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,250
[line ringing]

1036
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:50,528
[upbeat music]

1037
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:51,962
{\an8}[Kris] <i>Hi.</i>

1038
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,064
Hey, Mom.

1039
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,299
-You wanna sit down?
-[Kris] I'd love to.

1040
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,468
-Hi, Kourt.
-[Kourtney] Hi, Mom.

1041
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,136
[Kris] Um, where's Scott?

1042
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,442
[Kourtney] Um, I called him

1043
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,278
when I was going to
pick up Mason from school.

1044
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,915
Scott and Tyga have been
hanging out at his house.

1045
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,616
All day and night.

1046
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,720
[Kris] I thought Scott
was finding his way,

1047
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,221
and his balance.

1048
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,691
[Kris] I'm really disappointed
and worried about him.

1049
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,660
It breaks my heart.

1050
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,895
I almost called T

1051
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,631
screaming on the absolute top of my lungs,

1052
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,533
you don't even know
what would've gone down.

1053
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,701
[Kylie] Who cares?

1054
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:34,372
I know Kourtney kind of gets mad
at Tyga sometimes,

1055
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,574
and redirects her anger towards him

1056
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,143
since Tyga and Scott
are together all the time,

1057
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,013
so I'm kinda stuck
between a rock and a hard place.

1058
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,183
Scott needs to grow some balls
and be a bigger person.

1059
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,486
-No, he just needs to grow up.
-[Kim] Yeah.

1060
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,289
[Kourtney] But I'm saying
not for me, for my kids.

1061
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:57,762
Scott really needs to want to get his life

1062
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,398
in the right direction for himself,

1063
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,500
but I just don't want Tyga

1064
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,569
to be like a negative influence on Scott.

1065
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,239
So, it just gives me a bad taste
in my mouth.

1066
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,875
It pisses me off that people like Tyga,

1067
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,510
who should know better,

1068
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,979
{\an8}that are close to our family,

1069
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,782
{\an8}that don't just, like,
find some other friends.

1070
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,557
[Khloé] <i>This season on</i>

1071
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,025
Keeping Up with the Kardashians…

1072
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,059
[laughter]

1073
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,263
My one fan. Thank you, Khloé.

1074
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,497
Are you thinking about having a third?

1075
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,533
Kanye has said it every single day.

1076
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,568
I don't think I can carry another one.

1077
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,803
[paparazzi clamoring]

1078
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,771
I can't remember what it's like to go out,

1079
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,673
and nobody know who I am.

1080
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,141
[Khloé laughing]

1081
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,610
[Khloé] Oh, my god, there's a paparazzi.

1082
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,213
Lamar wants to go to Kanye's fashion show.

1083
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,314
[whooping]

1084
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,683
[Khloé] <i>This is Lamar's
first time out in public.</i>

1085
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,552
[Kim] <i>This is the most epic day!</i>

1086
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,488
Lam is nervous about meeting Caitlyn.

1087
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,290
What has happened? We got to talk.

1088
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,460
-[Kris] You guys know where you are?
-Vail.

1089
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,295
[Kris] Go for it!

1090
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,964
[Khloé] Here's to creating new memories.

1091
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,966
Oh, my god.
[shrieks]

1092
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,301
[laughs]

1093
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,736
I don't think
a girl's ever done that for me.

1094
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,407
No successful relationship
can happen in Los Angeles.

1095
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,608
-Let's move.
-[laughs]

1096
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,044
He's been so good.

1097
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,646
[Kourtney] I almost wanna call Tyga,

1098
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,815
and just literally go off on him.

1099
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,517
You think I'm the bad guy all the time.

1100
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,652
[Tyga] He still has to make
a decision as a man.

1101
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,221
Trust me, I'm trying.

1102
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,489
Welcome home, baby.

1103
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,792
The fact that now he wants
to be so public blows my mind.

1104
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,026
[Rob] <i>I don't want no fighting.</i>

1105
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,661
You make sure that your girlfriend

1106
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,129
doesn't publicly bash your sisters.

1107
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,264
[Khloé] No.

1108
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,999
He proposed in front of her whole family.

1109
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,100
That's so [bleep] up.

1110
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,102
Listen to your hostility in your voice.

1111
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,904
That's exactly why I don't say anything.

1112
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,073
This is the first time I ever proposed
to someone in my life.

1113
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,141
Don't come at me with some bull [bleep].
