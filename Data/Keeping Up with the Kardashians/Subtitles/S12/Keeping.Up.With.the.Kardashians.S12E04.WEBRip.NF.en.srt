00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,605
{\an8}-[Kris] Welcome home, baby.
-[Kim] You look good.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,941
{\an8}[Kris] Rob is moving into his new house.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,442
{\an8}It's been a labor of love.

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,044
{\an8}Do you love it? Do you love it?
Do you love it?

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,646
{\an8}[Kim] After Rob and Blac Chyna
started dating,

6
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,281
{\an8}Rob is out and about.

7
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,449
{\an8}It's a miracle.

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,085
{\an8}If she gave him confidence,
more power to her.

9
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,121
{\an8}Even though there's been this drama,

10
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,355
{\an8}if this is what it takes,

11
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,224
{\an8}I don't care who he's dating.

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,261

13
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,534
{\an8}[Kylie] <i>Where's Khloé?</i>

14
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,869
{\an8}[Harry] <i>I don't know.
I haven't seen her yet.</i>

15
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:38,405
Okay, cool. Harry's gonna be,
like, a little assistant.

16
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,672
[Harry] What does that mean? Like…

17
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,741
-Am I gonna be your assistant--
-Like a sous-chef. Sous-chef.

18
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,010
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

19
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,078
[Kylie] Hello!

20
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,746
-Hello.
-I'm so excited for this.

21
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,081
I'm so excited for this.

22
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,383
[Khloé] This is so up my alley.

23
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,318
[Kylie] Hey, Khlo.

24
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,054
What are we doing today?

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,156
Cooking with Kylie on her app!

26
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,191
[Kylie] Today we have sliders.

27
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,660
[Khloé] But you know
I don't eat red meat or pork,

28
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,795
and you picked that.

29
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,763
That's why I said chicken. That's okay.

30
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,066
So Khloé doesn't eat red meat. So, great.

31
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,133
{\an8}-So…
-[Khloé] Or pork.

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,868
{\an8}-So this is a great meal.
-Or pork.

33
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,204
So, she's not gonna be able
to eat this meal.

34
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,873
[Khloé] Just to be on a segment
on your app

35
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,177
makes me so [bleep] lubricated,
you have no idea.

36
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,445
[snorts]

37
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,514
Okay, so it's always good
to know how to make sliders.

38
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,817
Today we have beef.

39
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,218
-Ooh.
-Ground beef.

40
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,653
[Kylie] These are all our condiments.

41
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,887
Condoms!

42
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,355
Um…
[clicks tongue]

43
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,425
-We have our little slider buns.
-[muffled laughter]

44
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,194
[Khloé] Buns! Yeah!

45
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,395
Bidi-bidi-bun-bun!

46
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,264
But it never hurts to marinate your meat.

47
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,301
[Harry] That's actually disgusting, Khloé.

48
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,936
[Kylie] And we have white cheddar.

49
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,504
Do you like white cheddar the best?

50
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,239
-Yeah, I do.
-[Harry] Why's that?

51
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,874
[Kylie] I don't know.
I just like how it tastes.

52
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,275
-Makes me feel good.
-[Harry] Yeah. Yeah, no.

53
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,944
I love things that make me feel good.

54
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,112
-Like what?
-Yeah.

55
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,080
Normally, they're not white.

56
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,748
Hmm.

57
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,184
[exhales deeply]
Damn.

58
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,853
-Like you, Harry.

62
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,374

Chic Spice.

64

-Furry Spice.
-[Khloé] Yeah, Sporty Spice.

65
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,516
Did you see my bowling pic with the, um…

66
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,417
Why are you sitting right here?

67
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,153
Like, how am I supposed to talk to you?
[laughs]

68
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,255
-So I'll just finish this story…
-Wait, so just sit right here.

69
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,422
-…really quick.
-Oh, wait.

70
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,091
-She's telling us something.
-Okay.

71
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,159
[Kim] So, I called Rob,

72
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,661
and he said
that Chyna wants to talk to me.

73
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,496
And, you know, I just told him

74
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,231
that I'll talk to her when I'm ready.

75
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,600
And so, he put me on speaker.

76
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,736
And then he was like,
"Oh, Kim, Chyna's in the room."

77
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:50,837
[gasps]

78
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,506
"Um, I just wanted to tell you
so you didn't think I was alone."

79
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,209
And so she goes, "Hi," in the background,

80
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,378
-and I didn't say anything--
-You didn't say hi?

81
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,580
No, I did not know what to say, I froze.

82
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,549
-[Khloé] You're joking.
-No, he goes, "Hold on."

83
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,684
"I'm gonna brush my teeth.
You talk to her."

84
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,985
And so I go, "Okay, gotta go. Bye."

85
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,086
And I hung up.

86
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,356
[Kim] I understand that Kylie dating Tyga

87
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,158
completely broke Chyna's heart.

88
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,395
I feel for her
in that, you know, situation.

89
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,197
[Kim] Was it uncomfortable for me

90
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,632
when Kylie and Tyga started to date?

91
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,767
Absolutely.

92
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,702
Because Chyna was my friend,

93
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,972
but I had no choice
but to take my sister's side.

94
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,173
That's my sister.

95
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,608
I just wasn't ready, you know?

96
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,211
And I'm not gonna, like, be forced
to be on the phone with her.

97
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,879
Do I think that everyone needs

98
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,415
to sit down and talk
and work it out? Absolutely.

99
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,984
I'll talk to her when I am ready.

100
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,487
I have no reason to be rude.

101
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,656
This is a…
I love talking to you like this.

102

your text messages too.

00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,564

Hi, P.

111
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,183
[Kourtney] You wanna go with Kenny

112

-and I'll get your backpack?
-Yeah.

-[Kendall] Come on.

00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,122
I have been working nonstop
and traveling a lot.

115
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,491
So when I do come home, I try hard to see

116
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,059
my sisters and my brother.

117
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:23,263
Mama, you see the slices of bread.

118

[Kendall] The last couple of times
I've gone home,

119
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,898
my nieces and nephews,

120
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,500
every time I feel like they get bigger,

121
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,668
and they grow up even more.

122
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,869
[Kendall] It's, like, crazy.

123
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,271
[Kourtney] The turkey Reuben sounds good.

124
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,472
What comes on it?

125
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:36,075
Turkey, Thousand Island,
sauerkraut, and mozzarella.

126
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,710
What's sauerkraut?

127
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,313
You don't know what sauerkraut is?

128
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,914
No. It sounds gross.

129
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,316
[Kourtney] It's like…

130
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,885
sour.

131
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,787
-Kraut?
-[Kourtney] Exactly.

132
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,889
-I don't know what kraut is.
-Yeah, I'm, like,

133
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,592
not on my A game today.

134
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,726
Mm.

135
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,962
Kylie looked so pretty last night.

136
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,497
[Kendall] Oh, what did you guys do?

137
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,998
[Kourtney] Nicole Reda's in town.

138
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,100
They're staying with Allie
and our friend, Ben.

139
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,536
I took them to the WME party.

140
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,039
[Kourtney smacks lips]
And it was fun.

141
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,441
Again, I love that you called me

142
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,144
-to hang out.
-I know.

143
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,179
I'm joking.

144
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,248
-[Kendall] You didn't call me.
-Oh.

145
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,687
Mm…

146
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,458
I feel torn sometimes
'cause I do love my career,

147
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,126
and I love being able to travel the world

148
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,828
and I feel blessed. But at the same time,

149
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,530
I don't get to see my family very often.

150
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,699
I feel like I'm missing out
on certain things at home,

151
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:33,866
and it sucks.

152
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,469
You don't use
the blue one very often, do you?

153
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,271
[Penelope speaks indistinctly]

154
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,774
I ran into your friend, Leon, last night.

155
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,810
[Kourtney] He was at Chateau.

156
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,545
You know, it like, still really annoys me

157
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,381
that you guys come to the city
and don't hang out with me.

158
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,751
You aren't always here,
so then we, like, forget.

159
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,353
-You forget about me?
-[Kourtney] Yep.

160
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,024
[upbeat music]

161
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,499
{\an8}[Kourtney] Oh, my god.
We were reading a Bible book,

162
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,001
and the angel in the book was this

163
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,003
person with long hair

164
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,472
and, like, a white long dress.

165
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,541
Penelope was like,
"That looks like my grandma!"

166
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,344
And I was like, "Which grandma, Bonnie?"

167
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,779
She was like, "No."

168
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,581
And I go, "Lovey? Gigi?"

169
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,249
And she was like, "No." And she goes,

170
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,753
"My grandma that came with us
to see <i>Zootopia</i>."

171
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,421

So I was thinking, I didn't even think

173
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,258
Caitlyn was a grandma.

174
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,726
-Yeah.
-[Kourtney] You know?

175
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,595
-[Kris] Hey, guys.
-[Kourtney] Hey, Mom.

176
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,663
-Hello. So…
-[Kim] What's happening?

177
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,432
-I just went outside.
-[Kim] Yeah?

178
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,503
And there's like four huge scratches
in my driveway.

179
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,772
[tense music]

180
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:50,543
I have a strict "don't park your car
on my driveway" rule.

181
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,246
And guess what?
Somebody parked on my driveway.

182
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,982
[Kris] It does not look like a situation

183
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,117
where nobody came on my driveway.

184
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,786
I'm gonna kill that kid.

185
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,621
I can barely believe

186
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,757
that Kim and Kanye
are still living with me.

187
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,826
There's major boundaries

188
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,128
that are not being observed. So I'm done.

189
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,396
That's it.

190
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,331
Final straw. I'm done.

191
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,766
I have not parked in your driveway.

192
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,002
-This is the first time…
-It's people that I think…

193
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,537
-…in six months.
-…have dragged stuff

194
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,539
out of the garage on your behalf

195
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,074
and scraped it across the floor.

196
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,676
What would they be dragging?

197
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,611
-Dead bodies.
-[Kris] She has racks

198
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,746
in the garage with all

199
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,381
-of her clothes on them.
-But they have wheels.

200
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,450
No, I don't think they have wheels.

201
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,452
-Yeah, they do.
-[Kris] They're not those kind of racks.

202
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,387
-Yeah, they are. All my racks--
-[Kris] All the standing racks

203
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,189
-with all your bags on them?
-Yep.

204
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,193
Kim, you know, if this was
the other way around,

205
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,528
you guys would want me
to be more respectful.

206
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,865
You know, you guys like to live
exactly a certain way

207
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,233
in your own homes,

208
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,636
so why am I, like, being, sort of ignored

209
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,472
-for the things that I like in my house?
-Look what Scott sent.

210
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,474
-Oh, my god.
-[Kim] That's so cute.

211
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,876
All right. Well, I'll have
to check camera footage,

212
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,478
but the least you could, guys do

213
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,513
is be a little respectful of my driveway.

214
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,882
[Kris] I just built this gorgeous driveway

215
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,150
and it took me nine months,

216
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,752
and I just, would like it if you just--

217
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,688
[Kourtney] That one
kind of looks like Mason.

218
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,356
…paid attention to me.

219
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,826
My mom is insane.

220
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,162
[Kim] She won't let anyone
drive on the driveway.

221
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,297
They have to park in the dirt
and get a ticket

222
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,332
every single day.

223
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,134
[Kim] It's literally like this
every single day.

224
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,970
Like, she comes up
with something different.

225
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,338
Like, the washing machine broke,

226
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,772
-and it's all my fault.
-[Kourtney] She tells me.

227
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,674
-[Kim] She literally…
-She tells me all the time.

228
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,978
-It's so…
-The chef broke my pots and pans

229
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,779
-and my stove, and…
-It's like…

230
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,883
She just tells me
thing after thing after thing.

231
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,584
I literally deal with this every day.

232
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,785
It's, like, always something.

233
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,556
Like, literally, there's something wrong
every single day.

234
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,192
[upbeat music]

235
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,000
{\an8}[Jonathan laughing]

236
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,536
{\an8}This is fun.

237
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,637
{\an8}Mm-hmm.

238
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,239
[Jonathan] Oh, wait, let me see
that video for a good laugh.

239
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,942
Oh, and then I gotta really
show you a good funny one.

240
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,578
-Find me a funny one, please.
-[Kim] Okay.

241
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,314
[phone chimes]

242
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,350
[Kim] Hold on. My friend just sent me
something on Chyna.

243
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,752
What it says, "Bitch, bye.

244
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,156
Follow cooking with Chyna.
Infatuated with chai."

245
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,357
[Kim] Like, why is that?

246
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,493
Oh, 'cause Kylie just put
a thing on Instagram

247
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,861
about cooking with Kylie.

248
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,397
-On what did… Where?
-[Jonathan] On her app.

249
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,833
[Kim] Kylie loves to cook
and loves to bake,

250
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,169
so as soon as Kylie posts this video,

251
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,604
Rob's girlfriend,

252
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,507
who had her own cooking show, got upset.

253
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,876
{\an8}[Kim] Hey, did you just see
what Chyna posted?

254
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,144
{\an8}[Kylie] <i>What do I do?</i>

255
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,412
<i>What do we do about this?</i>

256
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,881
Just ignore it. Don't do anything back.

257
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,083
Like, Khloé, if you say ignore it,

258
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,319
she always has to do an Instagram tweet

259
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,920
or something as a dig.

260
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,755
So don't, like--

261
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,090
[Kylie] <i>No, I never dig.</i>

262
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,625
I was willing to talk to her.

263
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,261
I said, I have… I'm going on vacation,

264
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,164
and I have to, like, you know,
I need more time.

265
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,067
[Kim] I never left them,
like, thinking negatively.

266
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,468
[Kylie] <i>Yeah, like, we were close.</i>

267
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,303
<i>We were actually talking
about talking to her.</i>

268
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,271
Yeah.

269
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,606
[tense music]

270
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,208
[Kylie] <i>I think that Mom needs to,
like, talk to her or something.</i>

271
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,676
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

272
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,877
I think so too.

273
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,813
[Kylie] <i>I've never paid her any mind</i>

274
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,215
<i>or had any fight with her
over social media.</i>

275
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,484
<i>I didn't know you had a cooking Instagram.</i>

276
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,152
<i>I don't stalk your life.</i>

277
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,322
[Kim] Kylie, Tyga, Chyna, Rob,

278
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,758
like, all the drama, it's too messy.

279
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,693
I'm calling my brother right now.

280
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,196
[Kim] The fact that my brother
would allow his girlfriend

281
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,263
to talk so bad

282
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,532
about his little sister publicly,
isn't cool.

283
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,600
[phone line rings]

284
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,268
[automated voice] <i>I'm sorry,
the person you are trying to reach</i>

285
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,537
<i>has a voicemail box
that has not been set up yet.</i>

286
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:39,839
[Kim] So not cool.

00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,112
[electronic music]

288
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,053
[camera shutter clicking]

289
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,357
[Kim] She looks so good.

290
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,661
She literally has the best body.

291
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,963
I cannot wait to get in shape now.

292
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,299
[Khloé] I am doing a photoshoot
for <i>Shape</i> magazine.

293
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,035
I am super excited about it.

294
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,205
[Khloé] I need to work out consistently,

295
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,641
and I have not been
as religious as I once was.

296
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,111
But do I embrace my curves
and just say [bleep] it?

297
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,980
Sure. It is what it is.

298
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,816
You are so inspiring me.

299
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,284
[Khloé] Thank you for coming.

300
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,819
[Kim] Of course.

301
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,355
Wait, did you see, um…

302
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,991
Rob's Instagram?

303
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,126
[Khloé] Yeah, that's [bleep] up.

304
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,861
[Kim] It's so crazy, right?

305
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,664
[Khloé] Rob has been publicly
posting memes about

306
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,333
if the [bleep] is that good,
he'd rather be an orphan.

307
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,769
[Khloé] Like, to me, that's not funny.

308
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,807
I called him, and he said,
"Oh, it's just a funny meme.

309
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,142
There's no beef between us all.
I love you guys."

310
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,877
I'm like, "There's a beef now."

311
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,446
He's so annoying.

312
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,614
[Khloé] I have reached out
to Rob a few times.

313
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,184
Rob is too busy to respond to me,

314
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,152
but he's not too busy to post

315
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,287
a [bleep] meme.

316
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,555
That's so unnecessary.

317
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,223
[Kim] I just need a break from him.

318
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,291
Yeah.

319
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,759
[Kim] What is this shoot for, <i>Shape</i>?

320
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,260
It's so good.

321
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,896
-[Kim] Like, honestly, like--
-What's on your jacket, Kim?

322
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,465
-Me.
-Oh.

323
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,033
-Totally normal.
-And me.

324
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,801
And me, and me.

Oh…

326
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,070

{\an8}[Khloé] Oh, yes, Tina!

329
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,252
You looked so cute
when you wore that baseball hat

330
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,553
and that red jacket.

331
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,489
You looked like a down-ass bitch.

332
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,390
-[laughing]
-[phone chimes]

333
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,393
[Kim] Mom's so [bleep] annoying.

334
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,662
I walk in and my room is empty.

335
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,064
[Khloé] What do you mean?

336
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,999
All the furniture has been moved out.

337
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,268
But why… why is your stuff out?

338
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,836
[Kim] 'Cause she gave it to Rob.

339
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,905
And I was like, "Um, excuse me?

340
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,641
Are you gonna tell me
that you've emptied out my room?"

341
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,176
And Kanye walks in and goes, "Okay.

342
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,145
It's very clear she wants us to leave."

343
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,748
[Kim] I know we have lived
with my mom way too long.

344
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,785
I totally get it,
but I have six weeks left

345
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,987
until we are gonna move into our house,

346
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,890
and she's pretty much kicked
her daughter out of her room.

347
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,325
She could have waited a few more weeks.

348
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,728
So it's the furniture
that was in your bedroom.

349
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,897
Yeah. She claims that was his furniture.

350
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,565
-That's not true.
-[Kim] No.

351
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,570
She just lies and lies and lies. Own up.

352
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,605
Like, let's just be honest
about what you're doing.

353
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,773
I know.

354
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,376
[upbeat music]

355
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,981
[Kendall] So what exactly are you doing?

356
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,383
[Kris] So, you know your stomach goes…

357
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,919
{\an8}[humming]
…six times?

358
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,288
{\an8}When you get it all tightened up,

359
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,156
you feel, like, so good about yourself,

360
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,357
and then you turn 50.

361
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,592
[laughs]

362
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,195
Thanks for giving me something
to look forward to.

363
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,763
{\an8}So, how are you guys doing?

364
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,298
{\an8}[Kris] We're good.

365
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,201
[Dr. Ourian] It's really not as bad
as you imagine it to be.

366
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,703
So the CoolSculpting is a great treatment.

367
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,271
It's going to freeze the fat.

368
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,307
The treatment is FDA cleared.

369
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,808
And it lasts a very, very long time.

370
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,177
[Joyce] So you're, like,
so naturally gorgeous and perfect,

371
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,912
can you imagine having to do
all this stuff?

372
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:11,050
It's so interesting to watch,
to be honest.

373
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,785
-Appreciate your abs, honey.
-[Kris] Yeah.

374
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,787
[Kendall] Wait, on another note,
how crazy is it

375
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,755
that Kourtney and Kylie
come out to the city

376
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,858
and don't call me when they come out?

377
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,893
And I'm the only one that lives out here,

378
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,295
I live right down the street,
and they don't call me.

379
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,930
[Joyce] Sometimes you just get
really busy,

380
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,032
and you have time to do
one thing, you know?

381
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,267
[Kendall] No, but it's not like that.

382
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,402
It's like they come out here,
and they go out.

383
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,071
-Like, out to, like…
-[Joyce] That's not nice.

384
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,306
…restaurants and places.

385
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,476
{\an8}[Kendall] And then a couple days later,
Kylie came out here to go shopping.

386
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,479
They made excuses.

387
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,650
[Kendall] I'm in town,
and I had to find out

388
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,751
through social media

389
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,753
that my sisters are out in the city,

390
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,188
having fun without me.

391
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,223
Like, I already told Kourtney
that this annoys me,

392
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,259
and now it just sucks even more
that it happened again.

393
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,961
I don't wanna be, like, forgotten

394
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,596
just 'cause I have to work a lot.

395

You look like a little kid today.</i>

400
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,154
[Kendall] I have zero makeup on.

401

[Kris] <i>That's why you look like

to wish your sister luck.</i>

407

Good luck!

00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,577
[Kendall] I wish Kylie would have told me

411
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,212
that she was doing her lipstick launch

412
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,914
'cause I would have, like,
cleared my schedule

413
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,349
and made sure
that I could have been there.

414
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,085
I'm frustrated just 'cause everyone
has so much going on.

415
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,453
I feel like I'm missing it.

It's just a rental I got.

423

I'm just keeping this one
for a month for now.

Yeah.

I hope you planned something.

428

We got it planned. Don't worry.

429
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,952
I love it. I feel like I've spent

430
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,355
the last seven birthdays with you.

431
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,422

that's, like, still cool?

439
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,268
'Cause Kanye doesn't really do Halloween.

440
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,005
Yeah, we just have
to pretty much keep him Kanye.

441
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,139
-Yeah.
-It'd be fun

442
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,874
if you came out as Amber Rose.

443
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,676
You would kill it.

444
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,911
That would be the best thing ever.

445
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,246
'Cause he could still stay Kanye.

446
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,715
And Kylie could be Chyna.

447
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,386
And Tyga could just stay Tyga,
he doesn't have to switch.

-That would be so funny.

with the, with the stripes.

Yeah.

455
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,600
[Jonathan] Why?

00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,069
"So my chef told me that now
we have roaches in our pantry

457
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,570
because of all of the messes in there.

458

Honestly, my mom
is accusing me of everything.

462
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,281

She's insane.

or uses food in the pantry.

She's like, "Oh, um…"

00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,392
-Like, "Oh, you broke this."
-She's sick, let's nail her.

469
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,161
[Kim] I think it's just, like, ridiculous.

Like, I cannot take this anymore.

471
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,498

at my mother-in-law's house just tonight.</i>

For Halloween this year,

483
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,192
and then Kylie was Chyna
and Tyga was Tyga?

484
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,128
[Kanye] <i>Yeah, I think that's lit.</i>

-Isn't that--
-Lit!

about home and she said,

"I miss anything in an American market,"

502
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,738
like grilled cheese
and the stuff she likes to--

to my house and be gluten-free,</i>

I think she's feeling really left out,

512
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,459
and she feels like,

513
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,694
-she misses you so much.
-[Kourtney] <i>Yeah.</i>

514
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,796
[Kris] After the last show,
she started crying.

515
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,166
I felt so bad.

516
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,702
She was like, "I miss my sisters
so much," and I…

517
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,672
It just broke my heart
because she's so homesick.

518
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,408
Kendall can be really sensitive,

519
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,343
but she doesn't always show it.

520
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,247
So I think it's really important
that the girls give Kendall

521
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,850
a little extra love
when she's back in town,

522
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,286
and maybe surprise her
with something fabulous.

523
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,288
There's nothing like family.

524
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,924
[Kourtney] <i>I'm gonna be with Kim
so I'll talk to her about it.</i>

525
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,660
[Kris] Okay. That would mean
so much to her, Kourt,

526
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,827
you have no idea.

527
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,829
All right, well, I love you.

528
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,097
-[Kourtney] <i>Love you! Okay.</i>
-Okay. Me too.

529
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,232
I can't wait to see you.

530
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,533
{\an8}-[Kourtney] <i>Love you.</i>

532
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,178
{\an8}For fun, you wanna do the face swap?

533
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,279
[Kylie] Mm-hmm.

534
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,781
Ooh, there, I look really good
right there.

535
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,284
I think this is the best face swap ever.

536
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,286
I've always wanted to look like you.

537
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,322
-Hey, Kylie.
-Hey, Kim.

538
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,692
Oh, my god!

539
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,726
[both laugh]

540
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,962
That was your tongue
that came out of my mouth.

541
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,897
[Kylie] Your tongue just
came out of my mouth.

542
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,099
That is so funny.

543
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,401
-[Kim] That is so weird.
-[both laugh]

544
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,971
[Kylie] Rob texted me.

545
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,339
-Saying what?
-Last night.

546
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,673
Talking about how he wants to move.

547
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,909
[Kylie] He texted me and said,

548
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,345
"Does Tyga wanna buy my house?
I hate it, I'm out."

549
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,547
{\an8}-Why does he hate his house?
-Dude.

550
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,983
[Kim] I have no idea
what my brother's thinking.

551
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,918
I mean, my mom literally
just helped him move

552
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,019
into a new house,

553
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,622
and now he says he doesn't want
the house anymore.

554
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,057
I mean, as crazy as my mom is right now,

555
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,893
I don't know why he's being
so crazy mean to her.

556
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,130
I said, "Robert, why you gotta
let Mom get all disrespected?"

557
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,598
"That's so hurtful to my mom."

558
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,900
"Let me get happy
and the rest will follow."

559
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,670
Dude. I need to call Mom right now.

560
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,171
She should never have done that.

561
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,206
I know.

562
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,610
[upbeat music]

563
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,488
[Kim] It's so funny
that Mom literally copies everything I do.

564
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:31,923
-Like what?
-She, like, wore a baseball hat

565
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,991
and Yeezys.

566
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,393
[Kim] And I wore that this weekend.

567
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,496
Literally, every photo
is a different baseball hat

568
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,630
and Yeezys.

569
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,466
[Kourtney clicks tongue]
Um, so I talked to Mom.

570
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,069
She just said how Kendall's,
like, so homesick,

571
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,704
and that she was crying. And I was like,

572
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,873
"I haven't even heard
from her, like, once."

573
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,711
But it would be nice for us
to do something for her.

574
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,279
Like, remember, like, when we'd go to,

575
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,814
like, sleepaway camp?

576
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,450
And you'd come home and, like everyone

577
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,519
would kind of, like, welcome you home?

578
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,753
-[Kim] Yeah.
-I feel like it's like,

579
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,821
when you're an adult

580
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,223
and you have a job
and, like, you come home, like,

581
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,558
-no one cares.
-[Kim] No one… Yeah.

582
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,826
-We should do, like…
-So…

583
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:08,960
…a care package

584
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,929
and we'll be, like,
her welcoming committee.

585
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,265
[Kourtney] Yeah.

586
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,102
I mean, we could stock her place
with, like, her favorite stuff

587
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,137
and do, like, a girls' night in.

588
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,908
And just, like,
just get her, like, excited.

589
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:29,014
It does make me sad to hear
that Kendall feels left out.

590
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:32,217
I feel like when she's gone,
I never hear from her,

591
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,153
so I just assume
that she's having the time of her life.

592
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,255
[Kourtney] We definitely miss Kendall
when she's gone,

593
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,391
and I think that we should do something

594
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,892
so that she knows that.

595
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,228
[Kourtney] Mom said all she talks about

596
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,863
is, like, going to the…

597
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,998
an American grocery store.

598
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,567
[Kim] I haven't been to a grocery store

599
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,868
in, like, four years.

600
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,169
[Kourtney] Yeah.

601
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,004

what flavor deodorants

602
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,139
they have anymore.

00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,842

by moving out of my mom's house, finally,

620
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,618
and so she's asked me to distract my mom.

621

I'm going to try and buy Kim
as much time as possible.

my stomach looks wrinkly?

626

or not sucked in?

-It was not sucked in--
-[Kris] Well, it always looks better.

No, not sucked in is better.

I mean, one of my favorite things to do

682
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,817
is, like, stay in bed all day on a Sunday,

683
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,952
and have my computer

684
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,087
-and my books and my magazines.
-Mm-hmm.

685
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,757
[Kourtney] <i>This is thankfully
the last lunch</i>

686
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,192
<i>I'm gonna have to sit through
listening to this.</i>

687
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,261
[Kris] Oh, my god, it's unbearable.

688
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,529
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-Mm.

689
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,064
[Kourtney] Kim better move quickly

690
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:09,134
because there's only
so much of this I can take.

691
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,605
[upbeat music]

692
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,508
[mover 2]
Guys, we're running out of space.

693
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,842
Gonna have to wait for another truck.

694
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,245
Not possible today. Not possible.

695
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,747
There is so much stuff to move
and just not enough time,

696
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,449
so I'm kind of, like, freaking out.

697
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,450
We have to make it work.

698
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,886
Anything in the garage,
they need to empty it.

699
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,389
My mom was definitely trying
to pull a fast one on me

700
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,757
by moving me out,

701
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:37,195
but I will definitely show her
who the queen of surprises is.

702
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,431
I think she's gonna be sad.

703
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:40,599
[woman] She'll be sad.

704
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,535
But she'll run around the house naked.

705
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,605
-[Penelope] <i>Mama!</i>
-[Kourtney] <i>Huh?</i>

706
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,407
After, can we make something with paint

707
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,076
at Color Me Mine?

708
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,011
[Kourtney]
Let's see how much time we have.

709
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,145
[Kris] Uh-oh.

710
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,715
It's been a long day, Kourtney.

711
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,149
I'm gonna head home now.

712
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,517
-Huh.
-[Kris] Yeah.

713
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,554
So, P, can you drive me home?

714
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,822
[Penelope] No.

715
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,991
[Kris] Do you drive yet, P?

716
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,058
No.

717
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,660
-[Kris] Are you sure?
-No.

718
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,128
[Kourtney] When are you gonna drive?

719
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,831
When I'm five.

720
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,032
-Five?
-[Kris] Oh, five.

721
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,267
Will you drive me to the mall
when you're five?

722
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,902
-Mm-hmm.
-[Kris] Thank you.

723
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,704
[Kourtney] Are you not coming in here?

724
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,640
No. I'm going in my car.

725
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,308
-[Kris] I'm gonna go home.
-[Kourtney] Okay.

726
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,945
Okay, let me call KiKi really quick.

727
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,446
[line rings]

728
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,148
{\an8}-[Kim] <i>Hello?</i>
-Hi.

729
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,150
{\an8}-[Kim] <i>Hi.</i>
-[smacks lips]

730
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,286
{\an8}Um, so we just had lunch,
we just finished.

731
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,422
[Kourtney] So she's going straight home.

732
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,391
So I'm sure she'll be there soon.

733
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,892
[Kim] <i>Oh, my god.</i>

734
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,262
I distracted my mom as long as possible,

735
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,098
so hopefully, Kim finished the move.

736
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,433
[Kourtney] <i>Okay, so, uh,</i>

737
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,868
that's my update, I guess.

738
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:50,869
[Kim] Okay, bye.

739
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,840
Okay, hurry, guys. She's coming. Hurry.

740
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,777
[Kim] We are so close.

741
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,312
She cannot come
till the moving truck's gone,

742
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,314
or the surprise will be totally ruined.

743
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,354
[Kim] She cannot come
till the moving truck's gone,

744
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,289
or the surprise will be totally ruined.

745
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,128
[Kris] You look cute.

746
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,430
[Kim] Hey, thanks.

747
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,132
-Guess what.
-What?

748
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,437
Not one of my things resides
in this home anymore.

749
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:29,441
I spent the entire day
moving into my Bel Air house.

750
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,077
Stop! Seriously?

751
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,845
Wait a second.

752
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,580
Wait, you really moved out of here?

753
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,882
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

754
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,285
Oh! What?

755
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,454
[Kris] Oh…

756
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,255
My child moved out.

757
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,924
Wait, your clothes are really gone.

758
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,058
[Kim] Everything's gone.

759
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,928
It's all moved. The kids' beds.
There's no cribs.

760
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,097
-There's no cribs?
-[Kim] Everything's gone.

761
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,232
How did you know
that I was gonna be gone all day?

762
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,600
I planned it, honey.

763
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,235
Wow.

764
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:00,038
[Kris] I feel like a teenager
that just got their own house.

765
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,308
It's amazing. This is a big day.

766
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,043
-Aw…
-But, um…

767
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,011
-I'm gonna miss my roommate.
-But…

768
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,147
Maybe tomorrow,
we'll have everyone come over

769
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,081
and see the house.

770
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,649
I would love to.

771
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,719
This is probably one
of the happiest days of my life.

772
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,288
I can't imagine a better surprise.

773
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:21,259
I think it was thoughtful
that she decided to move out

774
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,660
and give me some privacy.

775
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,729
[Kris] I haven't even let it sink in yet,

776
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,664
but this is amazing.

777
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,566
[Kim] Enjoy your house.

778
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,567
Your first night alone.

779
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,137
[laughing]

780
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,271
-[door closes]
-Oh, my god.

781
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,873
Bye! I love you!

782
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,011
Whoa! I got my house back!

783
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,212
Yes!

784
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,580
[Kris laughs]

785
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,848
I love it!

786
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:48,553
[upbeat music]

787
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,964
[Penelope] Mom, where's Lovey?

788
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,065
[Kourtney] She's coming.

789
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:02,867
Hi, guys.
[chuckles]

790
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,169
[Kourtney] Hey, Mom.

791
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,870
[Kris] How's everybody doing?

792
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,605
-[Kourtney] Good.
-Yeah?

793
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,706
Yeah.

794
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,342
[Kris] You have no idea how amazing it is

795
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,111
to have an empty house.

796
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,413
Oh, I feel… I feel so good.

797
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,347
Mm-hmm.

798
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,417
[Kourtney] Wait, what's up
with Rob and Chyna?

799
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,019
[Kris] You know, actually,

800
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,621
I don't really wanna deal
with Rob right now

801
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,957
because they, you know,
went on his Instagram

802
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,692
and posted all these pictures,

803
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,427
making fun of the food that I bought.

804
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,729
[Kris] Just because it's really healthy.

805
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,665
And it really hurt my feelings.

806
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,768
[Rob] What the [bleep] is this?

807
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,837
[Kris] I tried to do a really good job

808
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,738
at stocking Rob's pantry

809
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,641
with some healthy food,
so I'm kind of shocked

810
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,878
that he's making fun
of what I just did for him.

811
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,114
I know that the posts are just about food,

812
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,116
but it just hurts my feelings

813
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,018
because it took a lot of time

814
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,354
and effort to make sure

815
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,389
that it was all perfect for Rob.

816
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,725
And so, I'm not sure
where it's coming from.

817
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,428
That pantry has to be stocked

818
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,163
for several different family members.

819
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,497
It's not just Rob.

820
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,466
[Kris] So shoot me 'cause we like quinoa.

821
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,203
He loves a supportive,
loving, fabulous family.

822
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,505
I don't get where this is coming from.

823
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,040
He's just so defensive.

824
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,275
So, I don't know what to do.

825
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:21,679
But your dad would have expected
more out of Rob.

826
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,782
It is hard to see, you know,

827
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,585
my mom so upset over Rob's posts.

828
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,121
And it's just a hard situation.

829
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,856
My mom does so much for him.

830
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,525
[Kris] Kourtney,
what should I do about him?

831
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,160
I'm just so confused.

832
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,863
There's nothing you can do.

833
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,365
And it's hurting my family.

834
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,938

836

{\an8}[Khloé] Oh, yeah, it worked.

00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,319
-Wait, so when does she…
-Oh.

838
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,654
-…come home?
-I did the wrong way

839
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,056
How cute, she has Lip Kits waiting for her

840
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,524
that were mailed to her.

841
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,992
Do you think this is interesting

842
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,228
that both of my kids are left-handed?

843
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,264
No, that's so great.

844
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,632
-[Kim] Really?
-That means they're gonna be

845

artsy-fartsy.

846
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,769
I respect lefties.

847
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:18,903
Really?

848
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,004
Kanye was a lefty,

849
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,773
but his mom made him be a righty.

00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,174
-[Khloé] What?
-In school,

851
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,510
-they made him switch.
-[Khloé] Hmm…

852
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,446
Look at all this. She doesn't let me
unpack the boxes.

853
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,481
I always ask, "Can I unpack your boxes?"

854
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,383
She says she likes to do it herself.

855
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,819
[Khloé] I think we should display it cute.

856
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,087
Like, look at these dead flowers.

857
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,790
Like, I want her to have, like,
nice new flowers.

858
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,692
Where are these from?

859
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,694
You can't eat her stuff
that we're getting her.

860
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,962
Just one bite.

861
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:45,430
[Kim] Mm.

862
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,831
That is so cute.

863
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,833
[Kim] Okay, what…
what do you want me to say?

864
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,336
Like, "We're so happy to have you back.

865
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:54,072
Your sisters missed you.

866
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,008
Here's just a few little goodies
to let you know

867
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,676
that we're obsessed with you."

868
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,846
"Hello, gorgeous.

869
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:02,914
Welcome back.

870
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,716
We're so happy you are home.

871
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,217
Here are some of your fave things

872
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,320
to welcome you back
and know how much we love you."

873
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,723
[Kim] Oh, my god, they have pretzel minis?

874
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,192
Does she really need those? Just kidding.

875
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,929
[Kim] Don't you love looking
in people's cabinets?

876
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,931
No. Shut her cabinets!

877
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,466
[Khloé] Nermal…

878
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,335
When you first start dating a guy,
it's, like, my favorite thing to do.

879
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,773
[upbeat music]

880
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,082
{\an8}[Kim] <i>Hey, okay, come here.</i>

881
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,851
{\an8}Where should we go?
Let's go in the garage.

882
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,152
[phone line ringing]

883
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,489
{\an8}[Rob] <i>Hey.</i>

884
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,457
{\an8}[Kim] Hey, Rob? Look…

885
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,093
I never get pissed,
and I am so for you being happy,

886
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,963
but whatever Chyna and Kylie
and all the drama

887
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,197
that they have together,

888
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,932
like, that's for them to work out.

889
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,203
Mom has bent over backwards
doing all this stuff…

890
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,841
My mom told me about Rob
making fun of the food

891
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,209
that my mom bought him.

892
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,477
[Kim] I mean, my mom literally

893
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,146
just helped him move into a new house.

894
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,148
I have to call my brother out on this.

895
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,317
Like, there's no way I'm gonna
let my brother disrespect her.

896
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,452
Mom is pissed.

897
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:18,089
When you start publicly bashing
my sister and Mom,

898
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,357
that's not cool.

899
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:21,626
This is just unnecessary.

900
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,528
We just, this is not what our family does.

901
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,996
Like, there's way too much drama,

902
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,464
so many haters in the world,

903
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,733
we don't need it
from our own inside circle.

904
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,369
[Rob] <i>I, I didn't even know
what was going on, first of all.</i>

905
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,571
<i>And I don't even think it's that serious.</i>

906
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:39,744
Everyone has to just not be
blasting people on social media.

907
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,913
You two are a unit now,

908
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,881
so it looks like you're blasting Mom,

909
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,550
and it's petty as [bleep].

910
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,687
{\an8}You two are a unit now,

911
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,589
{\an8}so it looks like you're blasting Mom,

912
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,357
{\an8}and it's petty as [bleep].

913
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,162
I just want everyone to be respectful

914
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,997
and to know that the social media part

915
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,532
just makes everyone look bad,

916
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,668
especially you, and I care about you.

917
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,704
[Rob] <i>We're not</i> [bleep]
<i>like here to hurt anybody.</i>

918
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,039
-Okay, all…
-[Rob] <i>We're here</i> [bleep].

919
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,140
<i>It's like real.</i>

920
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,509
<i>I</i> [bleep] <i>with Chyna. I like her.</i>

921
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,377
<i>I love her. She loves me.</i>

922
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,246
<i>I don't want no fighting.</i>

923
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,851
It's a little hard to see
my brother be mean to my mom.

924
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,919
[Kim] I mean, as siblings, like,

925
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,688
do we, like, give my mom a hard time?

926
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:24,755
Totally. But, like,

927
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,391
he really should just, like, be respectful

928
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,260
and acknowledge that my mom has put in

929
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,428
such hard work for him.

930
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,296
I think he just owes that to her.

931
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,232
[Rob] <i>All right, we'll go
about it differently.</i>

932
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,701
-<i>I got you. And… I got you.</i>
-I hope so.

933
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,202
Thank you, Rob. I really hope so.

934
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,071
-[Rob] <i>Okay.</i>
-Everyone should just be cool,

935
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,273
and we'll talk,
but this was a big setback,

936
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,808
and I didn't want that for you.

937
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,543
I love you and I'm not, you know,

938
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,745
I just think we gotta,
like, keep it tighter

939
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,348
and not have this, like, internal arguing

940
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,683
-that we bring out to the world.
-[Rob] <i>Okay.</i>

941
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,255
[upbeat music]

942
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,634
{\an8}[Kendall] <i>Hello?</i>

943
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,868
{\an8}[Kourtney] <i>Yay!</i>

944
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,103
Hi.

945
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,205
Reunited.

946
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,774
No, you need to learn how to hug.

947
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,877
When Kylie hugs, we push it in like this.

948
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,546
It's, like, really hugging.

949
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:22,580
-But, like…
-Okay.

950
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,583
If you really wanna hug them,
then hug them

951
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,752
in the way I just showed you.

952
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,220
-[Kendall] Okay.
-Hips forward…

953
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,756
[Kourtney] The last thing
we want Kendall to feel

954
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,257
is that she's left out.

955
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,193
And so, we wanna throw her

956
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,161
this little surprise girls' night,

957
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,496
so that we can all be together.

958
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,399
[Kourtney] We really want her
to know how valuable

959
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,201
having sister time is,

960
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,435
when she is in town.

961
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,804
[Kourtney]
We have all your favorites for you.

962
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,906
-Your favorite sweet potato fries.
-Food!

963
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,775
Oh, yeah. Thanks for my basket.

964
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,977
-Did you love it?
-[Kendall] It was so cute.

965
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,579
-Did you eat it?
-[Kendall] I did.

966
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,447
-Sadly.
-[Kourtney] Um…

967
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,450
We wanted to celebrate you being home.

968
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,352
[Kendall] Thanks, guys.

969
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,054
[Kourtney] We're… We never
not wanna hang out with you.

970
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,256
-I just always think you're out of town.
-Yeah.

971
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,425
When you're gone, Kenny,

972
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:10,127
we just never want you to feel,
like, alienated,

973
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:11,929
'cause we do so many things together,

974
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,465
like, we never want you
to feel, like, left out.

975
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,634
'Cause I feel like
Rob definitely feels left out,

976
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,069
so he, like…

977
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,837
I know, but I know… but I also know

978
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,839
that it's like I'm the one who's away.

979
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,407
It's not like you guys are choosing

980
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:24,942
-to not do things with me.
-[Kim] Yeah.

981
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,577
Yeah, true.

982
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,412
That's so funny. You get, like, FOMO.

983
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,350
I would get that way
when I was, like, super pregnant.

984
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,487
I love that my sisters put together
a little care package

985
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,956
and that we're all gonna have
kind of a girls' night together.

986
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:40,625
[Kendall] The second we see each other,

987
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,326
everything kind of falls back into place,

988
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,161
and we're always normal and we have fun.

989
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,964
[Kendall] And I guess, in the future,
I'll just let them know

990
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,599
that I'm in town more ahead of time,

991
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,401
and we can make time for each other.

992
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,137
Um, thanks, guys, for doing this.

993
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,073
-Yeah.
-[Kim] Of course.

994
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,542
Thanks for taking time to chill with us.

995
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,877
[Kim] Just pamper yourself.

996
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,978
[Kendall] Yeah.

997
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,481
[mechanical jabbering, rattling]

998
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,449
Mason, that's actually giving me chills.

999
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,218
-It's really freaky.
-[laughter]

1000
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,188
I don't like it.
I really actually don't like it, Mason.

1001
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,456
[Kendall laughs]

{\an8}[Corey] <i>Kim, I'm gonna call you Skinny K.</i>

1004
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,903
{\an8}What you, a size two?

1005
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,371
[Kim] Four.

1006
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,507
[Corey] You'll be a two in three weeks.

1007
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,975
Oh, hey, you.

1008
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,343
[Kim] You have created some drama

1009
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,312
that you need to get yourself out of.

1011
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,214
[Rob] No, I understand.

1012
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,483
I know what I need to say.

1013
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,919
[Kim] After I got off the phone with Rob,

1014
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,323
he called Kylie to apologize
to her personally.

1015
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,924
But I'm glad that Rob is here

1016
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,327
to talk to my mom, like, face to face.

1017
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,529
I think he just owes that to her.

1018

-[Kris] Hey, Rob.
-Hey, Mom.

1019
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,267
-Hey, Kim.
-[Kim] Hey.

00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,903
-What's everybody doing?
-Just talking.

1021
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,604
-[Kim] Just hanging.
-It's like a town hall meeting?

1022
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,673
You look good.

00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,777
[Kris] Uh-huh.

1026
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,546
You…

1027
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,549
have some "splainin" to do.

1028
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,955
You decorated my home,
did all these nice things,

1029
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,191
put, set everything up in my home.

1030
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,727
[Rob] Do you really think that me and her

1031
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,029
are gonna go around
making fun of everything

1032
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,064
when we were literally enjoying the house,

1033
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,166
our first night in the new home together,

1034
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,502
and we were laughing
and making funny Snapchat videos

1035
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,003
so everyone could see the house?

1036
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,005
Why would your son go around

1037
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,707
-publicly making fun…
-I don't know. That's why…

1038
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:37,908
-…of his own mother?
-…I was so confused.

1039
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,310
His only mother.

1040
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,514
I'm very appreciative of everything,

1041
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,982
so I always say that.

1042
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,650
I'm not that type of person.

1043
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,752
[Kris] No, I know. You're the best.

1044
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,820
That's why I didn't know
what to make of it,

1045
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,188
-'cause I was--
-Well, you obviously,

1046
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,390
didn't understand the humor.

1047
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,558
-But that was funny.
-Okay, okay.

1048
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,396
All right, well, next time,
I'll try to keep that in mind.

1049
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,499
[Kim] I'm really so happy that Rob

1050
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,967
came over to talk to my mom.

1051
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,036
And I just know that that makes my mom
feel so much better.

1052
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,906
You know, I think she really deserves
to hear from him.

1053
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:13,010
He really hasn't been making the effort
the last few years,

1054
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,413
so it really does show
that my brother cares

1055
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,548
and that he really does feel bad about it.

1056
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,419
When Rob was a little boy,
I used to walk in the kitchen.

1057
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,421
He would be laying on the floor,

1058
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,756
and he would put ketchup
all over his body,

1059
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,192
like he was bleeding
with a knife right here,

1060
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,827
and lay there, going like this.

1061
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,896
[Kris] And I would just walk over him.

1062
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,697
-Like, totally ignore him.
-Yeah.

1063
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,299
'Cause he tried to make me laugh.

1064
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,968
So I get that you have
this crazy sense of humor,

1065
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,172
but sometimes, I just need to be reminded.

1066
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:44,875
[softly]
I know.

1067
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,978
I love you, Rob. You're so cute.

1068
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,413
I love you too.

1069
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,450
I just really want the best for Rob.

1070
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:56,053
[Kris] It's every mother's dream
to see her child

1071
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,955
be really excited about life again.

1072
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,691
I think the most important thing is that

1073
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,893
Rob is in a really positive place,

1074
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,296
and that's all that really matters.

1075
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:06,997
{\an8}[Kris] All right, give me a hug.
I love you.

1076
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,432
{\an8}-[Rob] Love you.
-Bye.

1077
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,500
{\an8}I'll call you.

1078
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,335
-[Kris] See you later, dear.
-[Rob] See you.

1079
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,075
[Kim] <i>Next on</i> Keeping Up
with the Kardashians…

1080
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,744
I'm over not being able to go out
and just be, like, normal.

1081
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,213
[Khloé] I know this guy
who does prosthetics.

1082
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,048
[laughs]

1083
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,850
{\an8}[guide] Kim Kardashian's favorite place…

1084
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,152
[Khloé] The Kardashians?
The Kar-trash-ians?

1085
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,854
Khloé, run!
[Kylie laughs]

1086
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,190
Kourtney and Scott's relationship
is a work in progress.

1087
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,726
"I lost my family.
You guys gave up on me."

1088
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,161
How are you trying, Scott?

1089
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,330
He's just blaming everybody else
for his problems.

1090
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,364
[Khloé] Scott…
