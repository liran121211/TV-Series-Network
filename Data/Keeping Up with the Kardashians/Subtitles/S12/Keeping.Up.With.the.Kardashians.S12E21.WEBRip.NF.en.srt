{\an8}[Kendall] This is a huge bowl of fruit.

3
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,749
[Kourtney] Yeah, does it ever get eaten

4
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,752
or just get thrown away
every week and restocked?

5
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,220
[Kendall] That's really bad.

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,921
There are people in Africa
that are starving.

7
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,957
Did one of you guys
wait for the [bleep] answer?

8
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,794
-Can I have a peach?
-No, you can't.

9
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,429
I don't have enough.

10
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,865
First of all, I hope you guys
know I have a fruit bowl

11
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,802
every single morning
and I make myself smoothies.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,337
And do you know
how many trees I've planted

13
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,772
so I can have a lot of those fruits?

14
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,808
You have mango and peach trees outside?

15
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,412
Shut the [bleep] up
about my [bleep] fruit bowl.

16
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,881
Go back to your gluten-free house

17
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,483
and let me live with,
like, a world of Oreos,

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,951
and gluten, and flour, and wheat

19
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,887
and whatever the [bleep] I want.

20
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:54,888
Okay.

[Kourtney] Since I've been
drinking those floral drops--

24
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,245
[Khloé] Oh, is your heart
getting more open?

25
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,848
No, I literally cry at, like--

26
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,618
I cried at an Adam Levine song
today in the car.

27
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,421
No. You're not a crier.
Something's wrong with you.

28
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,457
-I'm crying now.
-[chuckles]

29
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,858
[Khloé] So, Chyna,

30
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,793
like, we should do something
really special for her.

31
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,428
Make her feel, like,
welcomed to the family

32
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,097
and, like, that we
are celebrating the baby,

33
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,432
not just at the shower she already has.

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,071
Chyna is throwing a baby shower
and it really sucks

35
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,941
because the date that the baby shower is

36
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,909
me and my whole family
are gonna be out of the country.

37
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,212
[Khloé] <i>We still really want
to throw her something special</i>

38
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,481
<i>so that Rob knows
that we're all supportive</i>

39
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,416
<i>and on board with their relationship.</i>

40
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,319
Let's call her and say,
"Hey, is there anything

41
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,321
that you've been dying to do
since you've been pregnant?"

42
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,389
-Okay. I will call her.
-[Khloé] Okay.

43

-[Khloé] Hi, Chyna Balls.

00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,164
{\an8}[Chyna] <i>Oh, hi.</i>

47
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,066
[Kourtney] So, I just found out
that all of us

48
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,935
are not gonna be in town
the weekend of your shower.

49
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,906
-[Chyna] <i>Okay.</i>
-So, we want to do something…

50
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,708
[Chyna] <i>For the baby shower?</i>

51
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,910
Well, like, I mean,
not even as a baby shower,

52
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,245
like, just something, like,

53
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,780
-special that we could all do.
-Like a pampering day for you.

54
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,883
Like when I was pregnant,
they took me--

55
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,385
We want to…
we want to spoil you

56
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,587
and Kourtney's so bad
at this conversation.

57
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,089
-Shut up.
-[Khloé] You shut up.

58
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,790
-[Kourtney] Khloé.
-Stop hitting yourself.

59
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,659
We want to spoil you,
and lavish you

60
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,594
and make you just whatever you want to do.

61
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,429
If you've been craving to do something,

62
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,166
but if you want to do anything
we want to treat you.

63

[Chyna] <i>Ooh.</i>

64
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,102
[Kourtney] We'll all brainstorm
and think of something,

65
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,037
just, like, something with all of us.

66
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,173
{\an8}[Chyna] <i>Yeah, something small
and, like, intimate.</i>

67
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,340
{\an8}<i>I'm down.</i>

68
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,475
{\an8}-Okay.
-<i>Thank you.</i>

69
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,876
[Kourtney] Yeah. Okay, bye.

70
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,545
Listen, you don't tell someone…

71
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,879
[imitates Kourtney]
…we're not all gonna be here

72
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,080
for your baby shower.

73
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,017
Like, act a little more,
like, apologetic and sincere.

74
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,485
[in high-pitched voice]
We're all not gonna be here

75

it's for DASH.

79
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,268
Mm. I am a secretary.

80
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,570
[Khloé] What am I?

81
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,904
[Kim] You're the president?

82
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,106
[gasps]

83
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,576
[Kim] Think Kourtney
is just an authorized signer.

[Kim chuckles]

85
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,379
[Khloé] I have so much
that I need to do workwise.

86
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,281
Mom is so [bleep] annoying.

87
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,016
[Kim] Why?

88
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,953
Like, they wanted to do this
whole fitness thing with me.

89
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,388
What I want to do is, like,
my backpack that, like,

90
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,823
I'm always wearing and paparazzi,

91
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,391
everyone's like,
"What's in your backpack?"

92
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,493
It would be, like,
the fitness survival kit.

93
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,329
But, like,
I haven't been able to, like,

94
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,798
reach Mom or, like, get
any direct answers out of her.

95
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,633
[slow tense music playing]

96
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,603
Like, I'm super annoyed.

97

[Kim] <i>My mom has always been our manager.</i>

98
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,941
<i>She is a good manager,</i>

99
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,811
<i>but she's just been, like,
dropping the ball a lot lately.</i>

100
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,947
We all feel a little bit
neglected sometimes.

101
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,282
She goes through phases

102
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,017
of who she's, like, really diving into.

103
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,785
-Just timeless.
-And it should be Khloé's,

104
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,687
like, emergency fitness kit.

105
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,556
I know what it's like when, you know,

106
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,659
you want something executed
and you can't figure it out.

107
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,763
And I feel bad for Khloé,
so I totally want to help her.

108
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,865
[Khloé] It's just really important to me.

109
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,967
[Kim] She should talk to my KIMOJI people

110

'cause we're doing, like,
all stuff like lighters,

once, but it's also…

115

was just in an accident.

-[woman] Yeah.

was in a car accident.

make it or something?

[Kris] He thought he could make it.

142

And then right behind him,
the other dude

-[Kim] Was it a paparazzi?

-Kylie and I went to see her.
-So, I just hung on

-[Kim] We're at her house now.

We can't buy a new mommy. Oh.

Thank you for coming.

we were like,

"She got into an accident, okay."

163
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,786
Like, we didn't…
still didn't think it was big.

164
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,654
Then we drove up the street
and we found her.

the last time we saw Mom?

-[Kim] I know.

00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,995
-God forbid.
-[Scott] Yeah.

169
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,200
[upbeat music playing]

170
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,874
{\an8}[Kim] Hey. What's going on?

171
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,877
I'm so exhausted.

172
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,480
-Everything hurts.
-[Kim] I feel you.

173
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,415
And I have so much to do…

174
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,684
{\an8}-[Kim] Do you want help with something?
-…and I'm just tired.

175
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,553
[Kris] Well, to be honest,

176
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,722
I'm working on this
Australia date for Kylie.

177
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,458
-[Kim] Yeah.
-But…

178
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,194
I don't know, it's just a lot.
It's a lot of details.

179
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,563
You'd probably lose focus in five minutes.

180
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,465
Why don't you just chill?
I'll help you.

181
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,699
[Kris] Really?

182
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,702
I would say, okay,
she needs security, glam,

183
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,405
she should find one person
to do hair and makeup,

184
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,942
and have them pay for hotel,
flights, and a fee.

185
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,311
But it's take care of your own travel,

186
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,146
so I would need you to get on the phone

187
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,782
-with the travel agent.
-[Kim] Let me get her on the phone.

188
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,585
I mean, I've joked a lot that I could be

189
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,254
my sister's manager
better than my mom could be.

190
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,190
<i>I think I do give a lot of good,
creative input.</i>

191
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,959
<i>And I know they, like, listen.</i>

192
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,094
So I feel like
I could totally handle this.

193
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,264
{\an8}-[Kylie] <i>Kim.</i>
-[Kim] Hey.

194
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,599
{\an8}So, Mom's not feeling good

195
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,301
{\an8}so I'm just helping her
with your Australia trip.

196
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,603
[Kylie] <i>Are you at Mom's house?</i>

197
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,770
[Kim] Yeah.

198
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,140
Um, there's, like,
really good shopping,

199
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,408
I can tell you, like,
all that kind of stuff.

200
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,245
But, to save some money,
would you ever use,

201
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,882
like, someone from Australia
to do both hair and makeup?

202
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,950
[Kylie] <i>No.</i>

203
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,220
{\an8}<i>Why, do you want to have Ariel</i>
<i>at that time or something?</i>

204
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,456
No, not at all. I was just
helping you save money.

205
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,191
'Cause the travel's included.

206
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,292
{\an8}[Kylie] <i>I don't know.</i>

207
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,796
Okay, think about it
and maybe let's talk in a little bit

208
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,999
and figure out if you even want to go.

209
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,034
-[Kylie] <i>All right.</i>
-Bye.

210
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,937
[Kim] All right, we got this.

211
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,642
[upbeat music playing]

212
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,650
{\an8}-[Khloé] Oh! Wow!
-[Rob] Oh, that's not--

213
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,718
That's definitely not Kourtney. [chuckles]

214
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,620
Wow. I see you.

215
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,322
-What is going…
-[Scott] Oh, my goodness.

216
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,591
What gave you the confidence
to wear that today?

217
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,659
[Kim] To wear what?

218
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,860
Stand up.

219
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,094
[Scott] Isn't that lingerie?

220
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,830
-You guys are insane.
-[Khloé] You want some of my Big Stick?

221
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,900
I prefer to suck on my own Big Stick.

222
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,169
[Scott] Bet you do, you little sucker.

223
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,938
Yeah, just give it a lick,
just give it a lick, Bobby.

224
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,239
Just one lick. Oh, yeah.

225
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,907
-[Scott] Oh, just one lick, Rob!
-[Khloé] Just one lick.

226
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,075
[Scott] Don't be weird.

227
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,611
[Khloé] Yeah, lick it once!

228
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,280
[Scott] Oh, it feels so good,
but it hurts. Oh, God, yes!

229
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,515
-Give it to me!
-[Rob laughs]

230
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,250
[Scott] Hey, don't hurt him. Oh, God.

231
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,551
[Rob] It's pretty good, though.

232
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,752
I don't remember it tasting like that.

233
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,287
'Cause you never had them
stuffed in your mouth

234
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,755
-by your sister.
-[Khloé laughs]

235
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,157
[Rob] Oh, man.

236
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,459
You seem good. You seem
like you're in good spirits.

237
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,595
Yeah, I'm completely fine.

238
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,631
Okay. I'm just making sure,
you go like this.

239
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,600
[Rob] I do go like that.

240
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,301
[Khloé] How are you and Chyna?

241
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,369
[Rob] We don't live together.

242
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,371
[slow tense music playing]

243
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,606
[Khloé] You're not together?

244
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,741
I'm not super comfortable at her house,

245
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,409
and she's not super comfortable at mine.

246
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,979
So after the baby, you guys
are gonna move in together?

247
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,480
I don't know.

248
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,116
[Khloé] <i>I thought Rob and Chyna
were getting better,</i>

249
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,252
<i>and I'm so disappointed that
they're spending time apart.</i>

250
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,655
A baby doesn't fix any situation.

251
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:27,059
<i>So I think Rob and Chyna
have a lot of things to work on.</i>

252
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,428
Hopefully, with a baby involved,

253
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,665
maybe that would motivate Rob
to try a little harder,

254
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,066
and to do things a little differently.

255
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,736
Wait, are you and Chyna still engaged?

256
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,510
{\an8}[Kim] Wait, are you
and Chyna still engaged?

257
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,812
[Rob] I mean, I don't expect
to get no ring back

258
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,748
if we weren't. I'm not tripping.

259
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,450
Rob and Chyna's relationship

260
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,819
is the craziest up-and-down situation.

261
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,689
[Kim] <i>It's like a lot all at once.</i>

262
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,491
<i>I'm just hoping that they just,</i>

263
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,893
<i>you know, can figure it out
before the baby comes.</i>

264
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,562
Have you guys built your crib
and everything yet?

265
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,630
[Rob] No.

266
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,866
[Khloé] Have you read any baby books?

267
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,502
No.

268
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,671
Do you know how to take care of a baby?

269
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,439
-No.
-[laughter]

270
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,374
[Rob] But, um, I'm a first-time dad,

271
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,844
so I'm sure I'm not gonna be perfect.

272
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,080
-[Khloé] Nobody is.
-[Rob] Yeah.

273
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,516
[Khloé] Rob, just do it again.

274
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:24,817
-Don't do that to me.
-[laughter]

275
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,253
-[Scott] It's not right.
-[Khloé] Just say something.

276
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,689
[laughter]

277
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:30,756
[Rob] Hey!

278
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,159
[laughter continues]

279
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,226
Oh…

280
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,928
[Khloé] You want to go look
at the guest house?

281
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,496
[Rob] Yeah.

282
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,532
-You guys not coming or…
-[Scott] Uh-uh.

283
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,067
[Khloé] Scott doesn't care.

284
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,334
[Scott] I was just there.

285
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,939
[Kim] What do you think
about them not living together?

286
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,742
I mean, I'm not
the best example, you know?

287
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,644
-[Kim] Yeah.
-I've been in similar situations

288
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,613
with Kourtney before
and after we've had kids,

289
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,681
-do you know what I'm saying?
-[Kim] Yeah.

290
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,783
And it's never easy, I mean,
Kourtney and I make it work,

291
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,752
but we're pretty unique.

292
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,254
Hopefully it works out for them,
but I do think,

293
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,391
if they're gonna make it work,
they need to, like, join forces.

294
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,859
-Totally.
-[Scott] I just hope

295
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,495
that they just, like,
get on the same page,

296
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,330
-and, like, push together.
-True.

297
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,698
[Scott] I mean, I would if I was him.

298
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,867
Maybe, you know,
he'll take the baby on as his,

299
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,503
like, his first priority
and that'll be his thing that,

300
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,774
like, really, like,
gives him satisfaction in life.

301
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,009
-Yeah.
-Little babies are tough.

302
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,244
-[Kim] Mm-hmm.
-Then it becomes, like,

303
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,079
the best job in the world,
taking care of a kid.

304
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,448
Now it's like, I look at Mason,
and he's just like,

305
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,150
nothing even gets by the kid,

306
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,885
he's just, like, so funny and so quick.

307
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,287
-He's so funny.
-Speaking of Marty,

308
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,656
-I'm going over to get him now.
-[Kim] You are?

309
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:38,924
I'm gonna go see what he's doing.

310
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,359
-I'll see you later.
-'Kay.

311
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,729
[upbeat music playing]

312
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,373
{\an8}[Khloé] Hi, Coca-Cola.

313
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,976
-[Kim groans]
-I like your jack.

314
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,711
Thank you. I was thinking
it's too big for me,

315
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,846
so you could probably have it, but…

316
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,916
So anyway, I just set up
your meeting with Whalerock,

317
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,619
and I just want
to make sure that, you know,

318
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,021
I have everything that you're thinking of,

319
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,757
'cause I want them to try to,
like, start sourcing out

320
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,425
people that could actually
make this stuff.

321
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,161
I think Whalerock could be great.

322
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,263
[upbeat music playing]

323
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,099
My mom is still in bed recovering.

324
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,602
<i>So I'm gonna be managing
all the girls this week.</i>

325
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,239
I know this fitness backpack's
really important to Khloé,

326
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,176
so I've set up a meeting for her
to meet with a team

327
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,411
that I think can really execute this

328
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,947
and get it going, and she can
sell it on her own website.

329
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,349
I've been trying to do this
for literally a year,

330
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,918
like, since before my book came out,

331
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,553
like, that's what I wanted.
I appreciate you,

332

361
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,986

00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,681
<i>I have the launch</i>

501
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,683
<i>I have to do</i> Jimmy Kimmel <i>at some point.</i>

502
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,585
<i>SoulCycle charity event.</i>

503
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,221
<i>I have to meet</i>
<i>with a charity called Step Up.</i>

504
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:26,692
I am, like, super overwhelmed.
There's a lot going on.

505
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,927
<i>You know,
juggling all of my sisters.</i>

506
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,330
I think managing five girls is definitely

507
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,465
a lot harder than I thought it would be.

508
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,400
[Khloé] <i>I need to make sure
that the charity</i>

509
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,836
<i>and everything</i>
<i>is done for my book signing.</i>

510
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,972

with that stuff, that's awesome.</i>

512
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,217
{\an8}-[Scott] Hello.
-[Leslye] Hi, there. I'm Leslye.

513
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,852
-[Scott] Hey.
-Nice to meet you.

514
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,221
{\an8}-I got three of my own kids.
-So, you're here to teach me.

515
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,157
{\an8}Not at all. I'm just making sure
my brother Rob learns.

516
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,859
[Scott] <i>So, I set up a class</i>

517
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,728
<i>for a woman to come to Rob's house.</i>

518
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:06,198
Basically, just,
you know, a one-on-one

519
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,667
<i>that gets you prepared
to have your first child.</i>

520
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,302
-How are you? Rob.
-Hi.

521
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,803
[Rob] So what are we learning today?

522
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,206
Well, we're gonna learn
a little bit about the girl.

523
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,841
How to bathe,
and diaper, and dress.

524
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,242
-[Rob] Okay.
-See, you're not even holding

525
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,777
-the kid right already.
-Nah, I know how.

526
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,412
-I'm up in this bitch.
-[Rob laughs]

527
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,547
-Are you gonna cut the cord?
-Probably, yeah.

528
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,682
-[Scott] I did.
-Yeah. Yeah.

529
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,050
-[Leslye] You did?
-[Scott] It's fun, yeah.

530
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,152
And they'll hand you a scissor
and you'll cut it here.

531
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,854
Then the nurse will cut it lower down.

532
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,422
-Okay.
-They don't want dads

533
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,024
to feel guilty if the baby has an outie.

534
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,792
-[Rob] Got you.
-So, that's why you--

535
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,227
[Scott] Right, they want a Bentley.

536
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,396
-Right.
-[laughs] Good one.

537
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,499
So you want to go from the center, out.

538
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,901
Is that okay, little girl?
Let me get the other eye.

539
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,036
-Oh, no.
-[Leslye] Now you use--

540
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,804
-Ooh, and then, oh.
-[Scott] Idiot.

541
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,905
[Leslye] You use a clean corner.

542
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,973
[Rob] There you go. Got you.

543
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,574
Poor guy just gave his kid pink eye.

544
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,610
[Leslye] Now we're gonna get underneath--

545
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,178
[Scott] Aw. How nice.

546
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,313
[Leslye] Now, we're gonna put a onesie on.

547
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,648
-Roll it up like a donut.
-Ooh.

548
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,518
[Rob] You better put
your [bleep] hand in there.

549
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,520
-[Rob laughs]
-[Leslye] Good job.

550
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,589
[Scott] <i>Rob looks like
he knows his way around a baby.</i>

551
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,125
But I'm not gonna lie,
a plastic doll

552
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,128
is a lot easier than something real.

553
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,464
<i>I think this is definitely
a good stepping stone,</i>

554
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,499
but he definitely has a ton more to learn.

555
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,337
-[Scott] Oh!
-[Leslye] Ooh…

556
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,172
That's called a concussion

557
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,306
in my book, ladies and gentlemen.

558
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,641
Well, I wouldn't do it that hard.

559
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,076
-[Leslye chuckles]
-[Rob] Learned a lot.

560
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,944
-[Leslye] Yeah?
-[Rob] Yeah, thank you.

561
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,579
-[Rob smooches]
-Aw…

562
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,514
-And thank you.
-May I?

563
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,685
[upbeat music playing]

564
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,158
{\an8}[Khloé] Hello!

565
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,760
{\an8}-[Jen] Hi.
-[Khloé] Hi.

566
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,628
-Sorry about today.
-[Jen] All good.

567
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,631
Today's just been… crazy busy.

568
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,066
-Jeff couldn't be here.
-Yeah, Jeff couldn't be here,

569
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,234
-just with the time change.
-It's okay.

570
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,635
[Khloé] Well, Kim is supposed to be here,

571
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,204
but I have no idea where she is.

572
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,941
{\an8}Okay. Um, I filled Jared in
on our conversation,

573
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,309
{\an8}so basically, we just want

574
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,378
{\an8}to hone in on everything from you.

575
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,647
{\an8}To, like products, like what
you want to accomplish.

576
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,383
{\an8}Have you decided
how you want to, like, brand it?

577
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,650
[Khloé] Um…

578
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,487
Hmm…

579
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,755
[Jen] Do you want to brand it KHLO-FIT ?

580
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,790
I want to brand it KHLO-FIT.

581
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,892
-[Jen] Okay.
-[Khloé] Um…

582
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,028
[Khloé] <i>I'm a little frustrated</i>

583
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,864
<i>because I'm being asked a ton of questions</i>

584
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,901
and I just wish I had someone
on my team to just make sure

585
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,070
<i>that I'm making the right decision.</i>

586
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,772
Kimberly arranged it for me,

587
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,274
and she also told me
she was gonna be here.

588
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,977
But she's nowhere to be found. [chuckles]

589
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,979
Did you like some of these,
or do you want to…

590
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,814
-I want to…
-[Jen] We can do a second pass

591
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,382
-at them, too…
-…look more.

592
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,750
-[Jen] Okay.
-[Khloé] Um…

593
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,352
Can you guys excuse me for one minute?

594
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,453
Totally.

595
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,423
[line ringing]

596
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,358
[Kim] <i>Hey.</i>

597
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,360
{\an8}[Khloé] Hey. Are you not coming
to my meeting?

598
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,028
{\an8}[Kim] <i>What meeting?</i>

599
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,130
{\an8}Kim, the merch meeting that you set up.

to a meeting with Kylie</i>

<i>we're working on.</i>

602
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,337
Okay.

603
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,072
I'm really irritated.
I just feel like it's--

604
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,241
Like, this keeps
happening to me, so I don't know

605
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,110
what the [bleep] it is about managing us.

606
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,511
But it's not okay.

607
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,848
{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

608
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,255
{\an8}[Kim] Hi. What are you doing?

609
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:19,791
How was your meeting?

610
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,728
I mean, it was good, I just wish
you were here, though.

611
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,231
I know. But I was busy
doing the LuMee stuff.

612
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,433
And then I was busy with Kylie's thing.

613
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,869
I just, like, I can't be
at two places at once, like--

614
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,871
Yeah, but don't [bleep] double book!

615
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,440
I thought I was supposed to be
a priority for you.

616
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,075
You made this whole spiel to me

617
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,044
how you're gonna be a better manager,

618
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,946
and let me show you how this is done.

619
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,315
And you're the same [bleep] person.

620
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,618
Did Kris Jenner
even set up the meeting? No.

621
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,954
[Khloé] Yeah, but you didn't
follow through.

622
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,489
For you to tell me,
"Hey, go and have a meeting

623
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,090
with my people," cool,
but you said

624
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,226
you were gonna be in here,
you forgot, you did Kylie.

625
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,761
And I don't really know
why you're taking over for Mom

626
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,129
when you're acting just like Mom.

627
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,166
Mom forgets about me all the time.

628
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,567
She's never at my meetings.

629
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,304
So, why am I trading one
forgetful manager for another?

630
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:07,806
-Because in--
-[Kim] I'll call them.

631
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:08,974
So, I'm sorry.

632
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,510
Like, I'll definitely,
you know, be here next time.

633
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,546
But I'll call them now,
and I'll get, like,

634
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,749
a report sheet on how the meeting went,

635
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,318
and what products they think
that they can really do.

636
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,786
So, have no fear.

637
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,722
[light music playing]

638
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,725
I feel really, really bad

639
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,260
for Khloé,
and I don't want her to feel

640
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,262
like there's no one there to support her.

641
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,932
[Kim] <i>Like, I'm trying to do my best,
but I should've been there.</i>

642
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,400
And, I mean, if anything,

643
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,236
it just really makes me
empathize with my mom,

644
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,540
and just how much she has on her plate,

645
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,842
and how she can't be everywhere at once.

646
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:44,976
And I totally get it.

647
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,814
The moral of this story is,
I think Mom just needs a team,

648
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,083
'cause obviously it's, like,
hard for one person

649
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,285
to be able to do this.

650
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,486
We've always said that.

651
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,388
Especially when she is like…

652
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,557
Like how Kendall and Kylie have Liz.

653
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,992
-[Kim] Totally.
-[Khloé] Liz is such an OG.

654
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,595
I'm gonna steal Liz
from Kendall and Kylie.

655
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,431
Seriously. Maybe that's,
like, our ambush move.

-[Rob] How are you?

663
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,052
{\an8}I hear you're taking over today.

664
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,020
[chuckles] Yeah.

665
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,757
Rob needs to get in shape,
'cause he's about to be a new dad.

666
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,726
-That's what I heard. Good luck.
-[Rob] Yeah.

667
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,194
Thank you.

668
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,563
[baby crying]

669
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,466
[Scott] <i>I wish I could say
that only sometimes parenting was chaotic,</i>

670
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,436
but it's pretty much
at all times, 24 hours a day.

671
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,738
<i>It's just difficult all around.</i>

672
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,641
<i>So, I figure, like, bring Rob
to a friend's daycare center,</i>

673
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,643
and see if he can really be hands-on

674
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,844
when the kid is not plastic.

675
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,480
-All right. Rob, get in there.
-[laughs]

676
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,549
[Scott] Just start grabbing some kids up.

677
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,783
So, what are we thinking, guys?

678
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,418
-Some games?
-[baby cries]

679
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,420
-Oh, oh! Pick him up.
-See?

680
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,155
Here, come on. You want to play?

681
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,558
Where you going?

682
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,094
You can't go on the carpet
with your shoes on.

683
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,829
You got to take your shoes off.

684
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:11,930
[Scott] We got a runner!

685
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,665
-[baby cries]
-[Rob] Uh-oh.

686
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,700
-Here.
-[crying continues]

687
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,469
This kid hasn't moved in two days.

688
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,437
[Scott] You all right, buddy.
What's shaking?

689
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,706
What's-- Ooh!
You look like Popeye.

690
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,043
[babies crying]

691
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,811
Everyone, just start crying.

692
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,480
[sighs]

693
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,582
[crying continues]

694
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,450
[Rob] Scott, are you gonna do anything?

695
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,386
[Scott] This is for you
to start to understand

696
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,888
the responsibilities of children.

697
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,557
I already know. I've been
in this game for years.

698
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,660
[Rob] All right,
I'mma go look for him, then.

699
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,429
Oh, no! Oh!

700
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,231
[Scott] That's not bad.
That's a normal day.

701
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,266
[Rob] Here, I'll clean 'em.
No crying.

702
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,769
-[Scott] Oh, God.
-[Rob] You don't see me crying.

703
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,570
[Scott] You're about to see me cry.

704
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,873
Get ready, Rob,
this is gonna be every day

705
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,508
for the rest of your life.

706
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,576
-[Rob] Wanna go outside?
-[baby crying]

707
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,645
-[Rob] Here you go. No? [chuckles]
-[Scott] Aw.

708
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,213
She didn't want to go down?

709
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,782
Looks like somebody loves Bobby.

710
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,284
I feel like, I tried to make this,

711
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,153
like, a little bit of a lesson,
or an experience,

712
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,888
but I realize that…

713
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,290
you're a good-hearted person,

714
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,692
and you're gonna be a good-hearted dad.

715
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,160
-[Rob] Yeah.
-That, you can't teach.

716
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,262
You're gonna be unbelievable
with your daughter.

717
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,697
You know, there's definitely
a couple of things

718
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,633
that Rob still needs to learn.
But that's the keyword.

719
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,867
He can learn them.

720
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,536
But at the end of the day,

721
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,838
he definitely has the heart of a parent,

722
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,506
and I think he's gonna be
an unbelievable one.

723
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,543
[Scott] Oh, my goodness.

724
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,578
Very impressed
with your gymnastics skills.

725
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,447
{\an8}-I got to tell you.
-It's your turn.

726
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,948
What do you want me
to try to do? A split?

727
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,416
-Mm-hmm.
-How do you do that?

728
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,851
Just slide in.

729
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,220
[grunts]

730
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,189
[screams]

731
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,290
-[Rob] Oh, my God.
-Is that good?

732
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,559
[screams] Oh!

733
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,228
[exhales deeply]
That's what I'm talking about.

734
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,596
[Scott] Good effort. Good effort.

735
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,600
[upbeat music playing]

736
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,442
There's some more monkeys.
We could do a monkey theme.

737
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,643
[Kris] Do you like this one?

738
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,213
-[Scott] It's kind of cool.
-[Kris] Okay. You hold this.

739
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,349
And you hold this.
And let me just think about it.

740
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,285
Oh, look.
This is so cute. We could do--

741
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,386
Where's the monkey?

742
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,855
-[Scott] I put them in storage.
-Here.

743
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,323
-I'll put that--
-That goes with it.

744
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,791
I'll go start a storage lot.

745
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,093
[Kris] Okay. I'm so excited.

746
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,896
After taking a minute,
after my accident,

747
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,766
<i>my body feels good,
my neck feels better,</i>

748
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:28,900
<i>which makes me happy,</i>

749
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,804
<i>because now I can focus
on the gifts for Rob's shower.</i>

750
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:33,905
-[Scott] You're just taking everything--
-[gasps]

751
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,907
I like that one better.
See that one over there

752
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,175
with just the daisies?

753
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,676
-Right. That's what I'm saying.
-We need that one.

754
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,679
I'm having another grandchild,
and it's such a blessing.

755
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,014
[Kris] Look at these.

756
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,350
Oh! They're just wonderful.

757
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,318
-They look big, no?
-[Kris] For six to 18 months.

758
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,154
Yeah, but they put a diaper under it.

759
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,655
-Ah. Well, the kid's…
-Goes on top.

760
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,257
…probably gonna have a big butt, anyway.

761
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:56,461
Okay. Get that. I love this.
We need the matching blanket.

762
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,329
-[Kris] We want the hat.
-Take the hat.

763
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,165
Oh! Do we have a changing table?

764
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,533
[Kris] We'll take one of those.

765
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,369
That's what-- We are gonna do
something practical here.

766
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,005
Practical would've been
if we left, like, 25 minutes ago.

767
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,040
Never had so much fun in my life.

768
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:12,143
[Kris] <i>I'm so excited about this party.</i>

769
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,914
I can't think of any more
important reason to celebrate.

770
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,082
Do you have a breast pump?

771
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,051
-Uh, I…
-Yeah.

772
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,587
But we need a huge one,
'cause she's got huge knockers.

773
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,424
[upbeat music playing]

774
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,500
{\an8}[Kim] I think I was
in a 2Pac video, you guys.

775
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,868
Kim, you were not in a 2Pac video.

776
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,002
-Swear to God.
-[Kourtney] Yes.

777
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,404
-2Pac!
-[Khloé] Kourtney…

778
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,539
2Pac is never your style.

779
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,374
-Never.
-I like 2Pac.

780
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,577
I've got to find this,
because I swear,

781
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,479
me, Kim, and Bijou were in a 2Pac video.

782
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,581
-[Kim] No one knows…
-[Khloé] Can you find it?

783
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,149
-You got to find it.
-[phone chimes]

784
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,551
[chiming continues]

785
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,087
[Kim] Rob and Chyna are fighting again.

786
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,722
[Khloé] What's the fighting about?

787
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,657
-[Kim] I don't know, I mean--
-[Khloé] Like, intense?

788
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,092
[Kim] She texts some crazy things.

789
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,428
He texts her crazy things all night long.

790
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,698
He just doesn't want to go to the shower.

791
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,200
[dramatic music playing]

792
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,338
We have the shower planned
for tomorrow for Rob and Chyna.

793
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,373
But now they get into this big fight,

794
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,741
<i>and we don't know what's going on.</i>

795
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,546
He said that he doesn't want
to celebrate a shower

796
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,848
because this pregnancy
has been really bad for him

797
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,550
and really awful for him.

798
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,919
You guys, our brother's
coming to the shower.

799
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,020
That's crazy.

800
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,288
So what do we do?

801
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,356
[Khloé] I don't know.

802
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:35,460
I feel like we should try to…
get him to come for Mom.

803
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:39,063
If it's for nobody else,
it should be for her.

804
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,899
She does so much for him.

805
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,436
We just really want to do this for Rob.

806
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:46,838
Especially my mom.

807
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,275
She's so excited to give him presents,

808
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,744
and just, like,
really, like, celebrate him,

809
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,413
so I think she's definitely
not gonna take it well

810
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,915
<i>if he doesn't show up.</i>

811
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,353
I hate that, like, I just have to be
the middleman between these two.

812
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,789
[line ringing]

813
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,125
{\an8}-[Chyna] <i>Hey.</i>
-Hey.

814
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,027
[Kim] So, Chyna, Rob is now saying

815
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,862
he doesn't want to come to the shower,

816
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,797
and I just don't know what to do.

817
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,699
[Chyna] <i>Oh, [bleep]. Okay.</i>

818
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,768
[Kim] We, you know,
want to shower you,

819
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,404
but we also want him to be
a part of it. And for him--

820
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,673
[Chyna] <i>Yes, him involved,
no, for sure.</i>

821
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,875
<i>Uh, listen, I'm for that.</i>

822
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,109
<i>You should just have it with Rob,</i>

823
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,544
<i>I totally understand.</i>

824
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,848
I love that Chyna is so understanding

825
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,050
and has this great idea

826
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,952
that we'll just make the shower for Rob.

827
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:37,855
[Kim] <i>But I just want my brother
to figure out how to be a partner.</i>

828
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,757
<i>The drama has got to stop.</i>

829
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,760
[Chyna] <i>Just let me know
how Rob is feeling.</i>

830
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,028
Okay.

831
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,196
[Chyna] <i>Thanks for calling me,
though. Bye.</i>

832
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,597
-[Kim] Okay, bye.
-<i>Bye.</i>

{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

834
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,645
I was gonna wear that dress today.

835
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,746
And the choker!

836
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,247
[Khloé] Kourtney, you look so cute.

837
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,849
It's Buford.

838
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,818
What an amazing shower.

839
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,587
[Kris] <i>The shower looks great.</i>

840
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,357
With guy stuff, and things
that a dad would need.

841
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,125
[Kylie] Wait, wait, keep going,
keep going, keep going.

842
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,460
[Kris] <i>I want to really celebrate Rob</i>

843
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,295
and make it really special for him,

844
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,197
and show him how excited we are.

845
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,265
By the way,
why didn't I get a baby shower

846
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,034
the three times I had kids?

847
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:27,205
I don't know, it's a more…
unusual relationship.

848
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,307
You want to see something
more unusual than us?

849
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:30,708
[Kris laughs]

850
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,777
{\an8}-[Kim] Hey.
-[Rob] <i>I'm not coming to the shower</i>

851
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,678
<i>if Chyna's not coming.</i>

852
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,747
<i>What were you guys even thinking?</i>

853
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,315
<i>I don't even wanna
talk about this anymore.</i>

854
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,484
[Kim] <i>I mean, this is crazy.</i>

855
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,053
All we're trying to do
is to keep my brother happy.

856
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,155
[Scott] Wait, so where's Bob?
Isn't this his shower?

857
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,191
[Kim] <i>He can't even show up
to his own shower?</i>

858
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,460
Like, we've put so much time
and energy into this.

859
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,063
I don't know,
it makes no sense to me.

860
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,198
[Kim] You guys,
I have an announcement!

861
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,299
Oh, God.

862
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,869
[Kim] Well, since no one's here to enjoy…

863
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,170
[Khloé] What's happening?

864
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,206
[Kim] I just got off the phone
with Rob, he's not coming.

865
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,408
[Kris] What a little butt face.

866
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,178
-What's happening?
-Rob and Chyna got into a fight,

867
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,748
so we thought we were doing
the best thing to not have drama.

868
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,084
So we made it a guy's baby shower

869
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:16,054
and invited Rob's guy friends.
And Chyna was so cool with that.

870
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,322
She's like, "Look,
I'm having my other shower."

871
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,425
"It's all good,
like, don't worry about it."

872
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,493
And then Rob now flipped out on us,

873
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,262
like this was supposed to be about her.

874
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,563
[Kim] Now no one's coming.

875
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,931
[Kendall] I can't deal with the dram.

876
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,399
[Kris] Oh, brother.

877
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,334
[Kim] <i>I mean, this is crazy.</i>

878
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,769
Rob is accusing us

879
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,038
of not being supportive of him and Chyna,

880
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,574
and all we're doing
is trying to be supportive.

881
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,944
<i>And we're trying to just do
whatever he wants.</i>

882
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,813
We thought he wanted a shower with her,

883
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,215
then we thought he didn't want
the shower with her,

884
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,450
so we tried to do it for him,

885
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,552
<i>and then he gets mad and doesn't show up.</i>

886
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,555
I can't take this [bleep].
Like, I can't tiptoe anymore.

887
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,656
Like, I've had it.

888
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,958
[Kris] I'm just sad that Rob's not here.

889
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,527
[Khloé] [bleep] Rob. Ruins everything.

890
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,566

that our attempt at throwing Rob and Chyna

901
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:36,000
a baby shower did not go quite as planned.

902
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:40,371
-Oh, Rob!
-[Sheila] Oh!

903
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,641
[Kris] This is the cutest surprise.

904
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,344
He sent me balloons.
And they're amazing.

Amazing.

<i>and open up their gifts real quick…</i>

923
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,689

-[Kris] Hey.
-Oh, hey.

925
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,294
-Look who's here.
-[Scott] Welcome to the…

Hey, guys.

00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,330
[Kris] Oh, presents.

928
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,032
[Khloé] Oh, hello.

929
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:44,635
Okay, so I want to just
start off this little soiree

930
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:49,874
by having Rob and Chyna
open this gift first

931
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,109
because this is very special.

932
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,578
Paul Crane told us

933
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,446
that he was probably gonna be a girl.

934
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,848
So I had something made

935
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,750
to bring Rob home from the hospital.

936
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,253
These better not be some thigh-high boots.

937
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,388
I wanted you to open this gift

938
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,525
because this is what Rob looked like…

939
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,994
when he came home from the hospital.

940
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,829
[Rob] Oh, in a pink, uh, pink thing?

941
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,998
-[Kris] In his baby bunting.
-[all] Aw…

942
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,834
Which of course I saved
for 30-- almost 30 years.

943
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,569
-[Rob] Is this the same one?
-That's so cute.

944
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,504
-[Kris] Same one.
-[Chyna] You kept that?

945
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,772
-[Kim] That's cute.
-You know?

946
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,375
-[Chyna] That is so sweet.
-[Kris] Isn't it cute?

947
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,580
So Rob, why didn't you show up
to the baby shower?

948
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:33,150
Um, pretty much it was a misunderstanding,

949
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,319
and I thought you guys
were trying to be shady,

950
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,855
and, like, only surprise me
and not include her.

951
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,791
So, I took it offensively,
and, obviously, didn't show up.

952
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,560
So instead of talking to your family,

953
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,629
you just decided to, like…

954
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,331
I want it to be about
both of us. That was just my…

955
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,934
It should be about…
it should be about the women

956
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,069
that's birthing the baby
just as much as it should--

957
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,604
It's both of us.

958
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,573
I just took it the wrong way.

959
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,941
-My bad.
-[Kris] But the good news

960
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,542
is you're a sensitive dude,
and we love you.

961
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,544
And it's all good,
and I love you guys.

962
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,713
-And thank you for this.
-This is amazing. Thank you.

963
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,016
[Rob] <i>Of course,
I feel terrible that the shower</i>

964
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,019
that they planned for… for me got ruined.

965
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,254
Ooh! This is really nice.

966
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,923
Sometimes when Chyna and I
aren't doing so well,

967
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,760
I let it get the best of me,
and I need to work on that.

968
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:16,694
That's cute.

969
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,397
[Rob] <i>I'm super excited
to be having this baby.</i>

970
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,932
It's something that I've always wanted.

971
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,602
I just picked out
some of my favorite books.

972
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,736
[Rob] Thank you, Kourt.

973
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,407
Rob has wanted to be a dad
for as long as I can remember.

974
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,708
Baby Robert?

975
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:35,579
[Kris] <i>It's every mother's dream
to see her child be happy.</i>

976
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,548
This is Robert's first Christmas.

977
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,916
[Kris] <i>So, for Rob…</i>

978
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,586
<i>this is such a great step
in the right direction.</i>

979
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,022
<i>And I'm so proud of that boy.</i>

980
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,192
Oh, Rob, it's a daddy bag.

981
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,994
Look, they got a princess hat.

982
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,164
Despite all of the craziness,
and all the drama,

983
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,666
there's, like,
so much to be thankful for.

984
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,537
New beginnings, new baby.
It'll be so much fun.

985
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:00,871
I can't wait.

986
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,073
Oh, this is so sweet.

987
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,274
[Rob] This is all very, very nice.

988
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,376
-[Kris] Do you like it?
-Thank you so much.

989
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,644
[Kris] You're welcome.

990
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,713
We all love you so much,
and we're so happy

991
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,348
that this is all happening,

992
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,216
and we can't wait till she's born.

993
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,685
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Mom, you want me to open this?

994
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,253
[Kris] Yeah, there are gifts in there.

995
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,355
Look, babe.

996
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,423
[Kim] A little Hermès robe.

997
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,359
[Rob] Ooh, little Hermès robe.

998
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,960
[Kris] Open it. Look at this.

999
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,062
[Rob] Two white Range Rovers, pretty good.

1000
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,297
Oh, my God.

1001
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,265
{\an8}[Kris] It's cashmere, which--
It's La Perla.

1002
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,868
{\an8}Isn't that great?
And then that goes with it.

1003
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,671
Wait, no one got the baby a Birkin bag?

1004
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,439
[laughs]

1005
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,707
[camera shutter clicking]

1006
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,809
[Chyna] <i>Coming up on the
"Rob and Chyna Baby Special."</i>

1007
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,544
The baby's finally here.

1008
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:43,347
-Here, Ma, feel right here.
-[Shalana exclaims]

1009
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,149
I'm gonna simulate a contraction for you.

1010
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,618
[moaning loudly]

1011
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,587
[bleep]. I need to learn that

1012
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,589
-just to learn that.
-[laughs]

1013
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,991
-[King squeals]
-[Chyna laughs]

1014
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,659
[Chyna] It's King's birthday coming up,

1015
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,195
and I just want it to be,
like, super special,

1016
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,397
'cause this is his last year

1017
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,298
-of being an only child.
-[children cheering]

1018
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,167
So, what are you gonna do now?
Moving? Staying?

1019
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,835
I'm gonna have to go back to her house.

1020
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,071
With a pregnant woman,
you're gonna have to suck this one up.

1021
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,306
Paige, I know you don't want to leave me.

1022
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,342
-[Paige] That's what you came here to say?
-[Chyna] Are you gonna miss me?

1023
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,078
[Scott] Congrats on the baby shower.

1024
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,813
Hey, hey!

1025
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,648
I thought this was, like, a chill thing.

1026
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,949
I didn't know it was, like, the Oscars.

1027
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,085
Did you ever think about a water birth?

1028
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,820
I think she's gonna do a C-section.

1029
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,855
-What?
-But she's down to do that.

1030
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,457
-She's down to go natural?
-[Rob] Yeah.

1031
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,092
Who's gonna be in the room
while you have this baby?

1032
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,894
My mom, Kris, Rob.

1033
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,262
Oh, Kris is gonna be in the room?

1034
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,397
[Rob] Chyna's mom just got into town.

1035
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,065
What was that whole thing
that your mom said

1036
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,134
that she said bad things about her?

1037
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,869
Her mom's just, like, a loose cannon.

1038
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,272
Sometimes it's like you intimidate people.

1039
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,140
I go off when it's deserved.

1040
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,810
And you not acting accordingly,
I'mma handle you.

1041
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,579
I'm trying to find my mom
so she can see you.

1042
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,981
{\an8}-Oh, God, here we go.
-[Shalana] Excuse me.

1043
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,052
-Are you scared?
-Yeah.

1044
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,787
[indistinct chattering]

1045
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,289
[crying] I'm freaking out.

1046
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:00,758
[Kris] This is Dad.

1047
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,560
[baby crying]
