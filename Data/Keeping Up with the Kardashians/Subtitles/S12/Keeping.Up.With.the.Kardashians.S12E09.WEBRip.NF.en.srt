{\an8}And you don't even tell your sisters?

00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:14,414
{\an8}We basically wake up to the news
that my brother is engaged.

{\an8}"None of the women jumped

7

00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,152
{\an8}Why would we congratulate him?

9
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,688
{\an8}We were thinking
of staying tomorrow and skiing.

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,523
{\an8}Me and Scott and the kids.

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,426
{\an8}It makes me really happy
to know that Kourtney and Scott

12
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,594
{\an8}are having so much fun

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,262

Oh, my god.

And this is all Snapchat?

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,262
Yeah, these are fun
and I can record them for the kids.

21
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,264
But how many different things are there?

22
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,266
Tons? Or do you have to download--

23
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,334
-And they change daily.
-Oh…

00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,003
Mase loves doing them.

00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,605
I'm sure. He's six.

26
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,841
Like, how this offends you…
[chuckles]

27

-That doesn't offend.
-That took one second in glam.

30
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,017
It didn't. A hundred percent
didn't take one second.

31
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,351
-No, literally.
-No.

32
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,886
Do you know how many people say to me

33
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,222
that my snaps are, like, the best?

34
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,390
What are they gonna say, they suck?

35
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,424
I don't ask them.

Went skiing, had some fun,
like, restaurant nights.

Your brother doesn't miss
going on vacation with his family, like--

46
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,363
He was invited.

47
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,632
And he said he was coming
and he ditched it.

48
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,967
It's his life to choose.

49
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,668
Do you feel like he won't do it

50
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,204
because he feels like you guys, like,

51
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,305
he can't bring her?

52
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,774
I don't know what she would do
on our family trips.

53
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,543
I don't know, if she's about to be family,

54
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,145
you might want to start thinking about it.

55
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,615
[Khloé] I'm not struggling
that Rob got engaged.

56
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,051
I'm offended that Rob
hasn't said anything to us.

57
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,220
And I think the most frustrating part

58
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,690
is Rob and I were always super close.

59
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,426
So I feel like the fact
that he hasn't said anything yet,

60
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,662
it just, I mean, it hurts my feelings,

61
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,031
and I just want Rob to reach out to me.

62
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,200
It's still new.

75

has been a big step for my family.

76
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,343
I think realizing that Scott can come

77
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,179
on our family vacations was big.

78
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,149
I'm glad that we had
that one extra night in Vail,

79
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,251
but there's a lot going on in LA,

80
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,220

I am happy that Rob has reached out.

The last thing I want
is drama with my own brother,

and be a happy family.

I am having another
one of my Lip Kit restocks,

I am a little nervous
about my next Lip Kit restock

122
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,233
because last time,

123
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,337
my website was over capacity
and it crashed.

124
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,739

so many negative comments,

But why?

I just think it's not
the greatest time to be away

148

and what if somebody needs me here?

149

But why isn't it a great time to be away?

150

Just to go so far away
with so many changes going on.

that includes going to Dubai
and the Maldives,

but I've had an opportunity
to sit down with Rob

154
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,948
and understand everything that's going on,

155
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,251
but no one else in the family has.

156
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:02,722
So I feel extremely irresponsible
for leaving town.

if he needs me.

00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,642
Okurrr.

176
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,277
-[Corey laughs]
-Well, whatever.

177
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,213
[Kourtney]
Mom, who did your makeup yesterday?

178
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,380
[Kris] Joyce.

179
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,815
-[Khloé] You looked so good.
-[Kourtney] The best I've seen

180
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,184
{\an8}-you look in a long time.
-I thought you looked so cute.

181
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,019
Well, good, I'll get booed more often.

182
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,588
[Kris] I was so upset
I didn't know what to do,

183
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,189
so I'm texting Kim,

184
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,924
"I just got booed. What do I do?"

185
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,061
[Khloé] I was saying to Kourt, like,

186
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,196
when I was at the basketball game
and I got booed,

187
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,365
like, it's just one person
and then, like, the…

188
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,367
It's like the wave.
One person starts, like,

189
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,468
who the [bleep] wants to do the wave?

190
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,469
But everyone just copies.

191
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,205
I was, like, very upset.

192
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,074
If you're gonna get booed,
at least look good

193
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,108
and you looked good.

194
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:33,079
[Kylie] Hearing my mom talk about
how she got booed at an appearance,

195
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,981
I so feel for her.

196
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,149
And that's the worst feeling ever.

197
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,552
Stories like that just stress me out,

198
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,154
and that's why I don't like
to deal with this kind of stuff.

199
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,390
Thank you.

200
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,159
Mom, I'm having really bad anxiety lately.

201
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,829
[Corey] What are you doing
when you notice it the most?

202
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,264
When I'm working a lot.

203
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,066
[Jonathan] Are you just overwhelmed,

204
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,668
or you just feel like
you have too much going on?

205
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,703
It's really hard to explain,

206
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,705
but it's, like, something in your mind,

207
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,441
that how your brain works,
like, you overthink a lot.

208
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,976
[Kris] Kourtney had that for a long time.

209
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,912
[Kourtney]
I had, like, a therapist on call,

210
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,347
and I would just talk to her
on the phone for an hour

211
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,550
and talk about everything,
like, sometimes daily.

212
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,251
I always talk about it.

213
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,586
I'm talking about it right now.

214
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,456
I totally forget that Kylie's 18 years old

215
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,959
and that she is doing so much.

216
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,795
And then on top of it being really famous

217
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:28,167
and having her every move watched
and judged is pretty insane.

218
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,770
[Kourtney] When you're really anxious,

219
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,538
you're not supposed to drink caffeine,

220
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,474
alcohol or have excessive sweets.

221
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,476
-Yeah.
-[Khloé] That's horrible.

222
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,747
[upbeat music]

223
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,763
Ready? Kris, this is Diala Makki.

224
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,565
-Hi. How are you?
-Pleased to meet you.

225
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,000
And my good friend as well.

226
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,735
[indistinct chatter]

227
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,772
[Diala] You have five grandchildren now?

228
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,840
I do.

229
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,577
[Diala] And your daughters are getting
more successful day by day.

230
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,279
Is… is it more difficult

231
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,414
to spend time together now as a family?

232
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,050
Do you have to work harder
at getting everybody…

233
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,685
I know you hijacked your family

234
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,887
and put them on a plane
and took them on a vacation.

235
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,057
I did. I did. I said "Be there or else."

236
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,395
I really need to be focused
on my business trip.

237
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,063
-Thank you.
-[woman 1] Thank you so much.

238
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,164
But at the same time,

239
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,266
I can't help but wonder what's going on,

240
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,869
and I just wish I was at home.

241
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,704
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

242
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,908
[Kris] <i>All right, where are we going?</i>

243
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,410
Great.

244
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,015
-I'm obsessed with watches.
-[woman 2] Me too.

245
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,583
-And I love…
-[phone ringing]

246
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,051
Hello.

247
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:52,952
[Rob] <i>It's Rob.</i>

248
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,020
{\an8}Hi.

249
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,455
{\an8}What are you doing?

250
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,559
Oh, wow. Okay.

251
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,528
All right, well, I'm just about to go…

252
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,764
Okay, bye. Love you.

253
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,466
Okay, that was Rob.

254
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,104
Rob calls me to tell me
that he's gonna meet his sisters,

255
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,940
and it makes me extremely nervous.

256
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:19,211
I really pray that they will
solve their differences

257
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,647
and see things eye to eye.

258
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,650
-I just need a glass of water.

[upbeat music]

260
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,631
{\an8}[Kourtney] <i>You know I shot
my cover yesterday.</i>

261
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,832
Yeah, how was it?

262
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,567
Great. I love Yu Tsai.

263
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,735
How crazy is he?

264
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,270
Like, he tells you what to do.

265
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,072
"Smile. Keep that smile."

266
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,807
Then he's like, "Okay, now, stop smiling."

267
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,909
And then he's like,
"But smile through your eyes."

268
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,478
I would think that you
would not like that personality.

269
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,180
-No, I loved it.
-[phone chimes]

270
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,318
[Kourtney] Why is Kylie having
a talk with Scott right now?

271
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,820
I don't know. About what?

272
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,122
I don't know. He said, "I'm with Kylie.
We're having a talk."

273
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,390
About what?

274
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,891
-I didn't ask.
-Oh, that's what I just asked you.

275
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,160
[Kourtney] I feel like she was
just, like, in an anxious mood.

276
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,663
She kept saying to me,
"I'm so anxious. I'm so anxious."

277
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,798
And so, I was like, you know,

278
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,967
"Working out helps a lot.
Work out with me."

279
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,135
Oh, I mean, for me, like,

280
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,771
workouts took away so much of my anxiety.

281
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,873
-Same.
-That's my place of solitude.

282
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,509
Me too. I'm like, I have to work out.

283
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,878
Just mentally, what it does for you
and that release.

284
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,279
-What up, girl?
-[dog panting]

285
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,583
[Kourtney] I had such a good workout
with Don the other day.

286
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,951
Oh, I love him.

287
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,919
Like, he's so nice.

288
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,021
This guy works out all day long.

289
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,890
He has the most energy I've ever seen.

290
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,025
He's not fazed by you and I whatsoever.

291
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,762
I forgot to tell him. But he was like,
"I wanna come to your shoot."

292
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,196
Who, Don?

293
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,334
Who, Don wants to?

296
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,520
Mase.

297
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,088
-What?
-[Khloé] Hello.

298
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,523
[Rob] Oh, what's up?

299
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,590
[Mason] Nothing.

300
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,694
So what's up?

301
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,897
Well, well, well.

302
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,431
What do we have here?

303
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,367
Oh, a new sweatsuit finally.

304
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,903
-Same one.
-[Khloé chuckles]

305
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,338
[Rob] Same one I wore ten days in a row.

306
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,240
Where's Kourt?

307
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,276
Kourtney?

308
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,912
Rob and I can't be left alone together
for too long.

309
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,413
Kourtney.

310
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,415
[Khloé] This is uncomfortable.

311
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,583
I love my brother,

312
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,052
but I haven't seen Rob in…

313
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,887
I feel like a really long time,

314
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,256
so I can't lie, it's a little awkward.

315
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,725
And it's almost like we don't
wanna be left alone together,

316
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,993
which is kind of weird.

317
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,596
How was Vail?

318
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,666
It was good.

319
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,801
[Khloé] Good memories.

320
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,470
[Rob] Mm… I was supposed to go.

321
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,206
I know you were.

322
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,874
No one told me it was a ski trip.

323
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,276
-Okay.
-[Rob] So…

324
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,045
No one told you it was a ski trip.

325
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,180
Mom says we were flying
an hour and a half away.

326
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,516
I had a stylist come over
and get me all shorts.

327
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,819
You always find some loophole excuse.

328
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,189
I'm not gonna go on a ski trip
with no… with nothing.

329
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,190
-Sorry.
-[Rob] No, it's…

330
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,525
There's plenty… There's plenty of time

331
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,227
in the year to go on a family trip.

332
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,596
Well, if that's your mentality,
then things will never happen.

333
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,297
There is plenty of time
in this year to go on a--

334
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,033
So there's plenty of time for you to do
what you gotta do, right?

335
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,201
-[Rob] Hey.
-[Kourtney] Oh. Oh. Oh.

-You can't leave Rob and I

-my movie theater room?
-[Rob] No.

-We'll go check it out.
-Check it out after.

and the movie theater are downstairs.

345
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,754
-[Kim] Hi. What are you doing?
-You look thin.

346
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,189
-I look thin?
-Yeah.

347
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,491
What do you think
he's gonna talk to us about?

348
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,826
[Kim sighs]

349
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
[Khloé] We were left alone together
for too long,

350
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,097
and I had an attitude,
so I'm not gonna talk a lot.

351
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,932
-It's like--
-Yeah, I think you just have to,

352
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,967
like, you know what? It's not your life.

353
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,203
I'm gonna refrain from talking.

354
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,272
Yeah. Just be quiet.

355
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,941
Khloé and Rob have, like, this, you know,

356
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,377
history of growing up so close together.

357
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,480
[Kim] So Khloé is obviously
taking this harder

358
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,881
than all of us.

359
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,483
And I really do feel bad for her.

360
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,151
[Kim] Hey.

361
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,120
My favorite sister.
[Rob chuckles]

362
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,224
Khloé should probably sit over there.

363
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,793
Why? Because I'm too close to you?

364
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,728
-You're in close reach.
-It's just better.

365
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,897
-Like I'm gonna hit you?
-[Kourtney] Let's just switch.

366
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,365
What are you gonna say?

367
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,500
[chuckles]

368
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,969
I know you guys obviously know
what happened,

369
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,571
just based on, whatever.

370
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,806
-[Kim] Social media.
-Social media.

371
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,910
But everything that happened,
I'm very happy about.

372
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,245
It was something that I--

373
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,913
So, like, did you get on, like, one knee?

374
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,548
[chuckles]
I gave her the ring,

375
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,550
and then I got on the knee after.

376
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,652
It happened, like, spontaneously,

377
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,521
so that's why you guys
weren't in the loop,

378
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,222
because I was gonna do this regardless.

379
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,925
I just didn't know when,
and it just ended up happening.

380
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,226
We wanna be honest with you.

381
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,929
We felt like we should have just
at least got a text and say,

382
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,732
"Hey, guys. I know you're seeing this
on social media. It's true."

383
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,100
People were asking us and we were like,

384
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,635
"We don't even know if it's true."

385
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,438
If you guys really were concerned
and wanted to know,

386
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,340
you guys would have said, "Is this true?

387
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,441
-Congratulations…
-Well, we felt,

388
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,608
-…you just got engaged."
-I'm not finding things out.

389
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,310
Obviously, well, you think
I'm just gonna post

390
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,479
some fake [bleep]
because I'm a media whore?

391
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,081
-Never in my life.
-Why would I say congratulations

392
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,182
if I don't know if it's true or not?

393
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,084
It's the first time I ever proposed
to someone in my life.

394
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,286
Why would I joke with that?
I don't joke with that.

395
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,787
-We understand, you know--
-[Rob] It's a two-way street.

396
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,122
You guys could easily

397
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,790
have picked up the phone and called me.

398
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,392
No, I'm not gonna talk to you guys

399
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,328
when you guys are in a room
with Tyga in… on a ski trip.

400
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,197
But yet you put it on social media.

401
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,099
That's not the point.
You act like I'm supposed

402
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,835
to just call you guys and just say,
"Oh, this and that,"

403
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,570
-when you hate this girl.
-[Kim] We would've appreciated that.

404
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,904
-So it's like, it's crazy.
-But we love you.

405
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,340
-That's great. And she makes me happy.
-So we would have appreciated that.

406
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,742
-And she loves me.
-And we're happy for you.

407
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:50,943
-Right. So we…
-[Rob] And I'm happy. And that's it.

408
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,845
Of course, we would be happy for you.

409
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,247
But we're allowed to be hurt
that you didn't tell us,

410
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,382
-but we're also…
-[Rob] But that's why…

411
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,484
You're allowed to do it in your own way.

412
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,586
[Kim] We see that you're happy,

413
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,554
and that's all that matters to us, really.

414
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,922
Like, we obviously have tried

415
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,492
to get you out of the house
for years, you know,

416
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,693
and that hasn't worked.

417
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,562
And so, if someone else can do that,

418
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,299
like, we are really, you know,
thankful for that.

419
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,337
Do you understand that
that was hurtful to us

420
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,906
that we found out about your engagement
on social media?

421
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,741
Yes, I understand,
but I didn't understand…

422
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,743
I didn't… I wasn't even thinking that
at the time.

423
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,479
It happened so fast,
but I get I upset you guys.

424
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,348
I get I'm your brother, your only brother.

425
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,383
You would like to know
when something important

426
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,785
like this happens.

427
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,455
I apologize
'cause I wasn't trying to be rude.

428
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,756
So…
[exhales]

429
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,392
And then there's one more thing

430
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,327
I have to talk to you guys about.

431
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,898
I don't want you guys to get mad.
[nervous chuckle]

432
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,567
[tense music]

433
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,338
{\an8}[Rob] <i>There's one more thing
I have to talk to you guys about,</i>

434
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,909
but I don't want you guys to get mad.
[nervous chuckle]

435
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,710
[Kourtney] What?

436
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,183
You're having a baby.

437
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,219
[sighs]
Yeah.

438
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,022
[tense music]

439
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,792
-[Rob] Just so you know…
-[Kim] Are you being serious?

440
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,927
[Rob] No, I'm being Bible.

441
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,062
I'm being deadass,
but you have to understand

442
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,798
I've been trying to do this.
I'm not even kidding.

443
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,934
This was, like, really my decision.

444
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,435
It, like, really wasn't hers.

445
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,838
On Dad's grave, on everything, I'm Bible.

446
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,739
Did you tell Mom?

447
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,108
Yeah, Mom knows.

448
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,276
She didn't want me to say anything to Mom

449
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,712
and you guys until she was three months,

450
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,515
but I want Mom and you guys involved

451
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,717
'cause I think it would be worse,

452
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,319
since obviously the engagement thing,

453
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,754
how you all reacted
and then she starts to show

454
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,356
or something, but…

455
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,992
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

456
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,260
-Congrats.
-Thank you.

457
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,231
I know Khloé's probably feeling--

458
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,866
[Khloé] Congratulations.

459
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,033
[Rob] Thank you.

460
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,103
[Khloé]
I don't know my emotions right now.

461
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,406
I know I feel… I feel more empty

462
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,409
and more unresolved
than anything else, and…

463
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,346
I'm, like, internally sad.

464
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,182
[Kourtney] Are you excited?

465
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,417
I'm excited, yes, but I know you guys,

466
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,186
probably feel really weird.

467
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,624
I mean, I don't expect you guys
to be all happy, but…

468
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,993
I'm sure you guys will eventually.

469
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,594
So…

470
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,030
She's not a bad girl at all.

471
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,099
She's really loyal and she helps me a lot

472
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,868
with trying to get back on track
and it's just good.

473
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,104
So, obviously, I want you all a part of it

474
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,506
because it's gonna happen,

475
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,109
so there definitely needs to be a talk

476
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,211
between all you guys,
'cause she's not going anywhere.

477
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,913
She knows I'm gonna be in her life.

478
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,514
She knows you guys aren't going anywhere.

479
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,982
I don't want it to be where it's just,

480
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,717
like, y'all don't have a relationship.

481
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,818
That's just weird.

482
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,588
[tense music]

483
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,861
[Khloé] I do think a baby is a blessing.

484
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,063
I think that if this is gonna get Rob

485
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,932
to get his [bleep] together, cool,

486
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,568
but I personally don't know
what the next steps

487
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,804
for Rob and his girlfriend
and all of us are.

488
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,806
I mean, that's up to Rob.

489
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,642
Obviously, things aren't gonna be,
like, perfect overnight.

490
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,311
-No, I know, but I just wanted--
-And, you know, I think

491
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,879
-we should talk, you know.
-Yeah.

492
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,949
It has to start somewhere,

493
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,717
and that's why I started
with Mom and then you guys,

494
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,653
and I'll have my talk
with Kendall and Kylie,

495
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,388
but I wouldn't make a decision like this

496
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,924
if I wasn't all the way sure
with everything.

497
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,994
-What?
-[Kourtney] That's exciting.

498
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,662
Babies are a blessing.

499
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,031
Who would have thought Rob

500
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,601
would've been the one to join the…

501
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,437
North and Saint and everybody?

502
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,107
[Kourtney]
Who is that little guy? Come on.

503
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,275
[Kim] Hi.

504
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,411
-[thumps]
-Ow!

505
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,247
-[thumps]
-Ow!

506
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,682
[upbeat music]

507
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,458
{\an8}Hey. Today is Freestyle Friday,
so we're not doing

508
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,293
{\an8}the motivational quote thing right now.

509
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,527
We're just gonna jump into the workout…

510
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,629
-All right.
-…and get it done.

511
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,897
-Freestyle Friday!
-[Kourtney] It's Friday!

-[phone chimes]
-[Khloé] "Could not send."

513
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,635
Kourtney, what the [bleep] is up
with your Wi-Fi?

514
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,169
You have this big-ass house

515
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,105
and you can't afford a Wi-Fi box out here?

516
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,708
It's not about affording,
it's about radiation.

517
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,511
You're gonna die anyway.
You understand that, right?

518
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,080
Die with a good Snapchat going through.

519
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,015
What the [bleep]?

520
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,216
[Kylie] Hey.

521
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,085
Kylie is here.

522
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,588
[Khloé squeals]
You made it to the family workout.

523
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,023
Kylie is here!

524
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,891
-[Khloé squealing]
-Hi, you guys.

525
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,026
[Khloé exclaiming]

526
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,962
Kylie, get ready to crush your anxiety.

527
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,996
Crush it.

528
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,766
[Kourtney] Khloé and I have
a lot going on in our lives.

529
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,334
We have, like, the best lives

530
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,970
and also the most [bleep] up lives
at the same time.

531
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,972
So, this is what gets us through our days.

532
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,073
-[Don] Here we go.
-Okay.

533
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,976
[Don] Three, two, one. Let's go.

534
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,512
One. Twenty seconds. Two.

535
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,514
I'm so surprised you could jump rope.

536
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,149
-Kim can't.
-[Don] Two…

537
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,251
They had to cut the jump rope over her.

538
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,853
She just swings the rope around.

539
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,622
Good. Drop your ropes right there.

540
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,123
[panting]
Okay, guys,

541
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,658
I don't know if I'm gonna finish this.

542
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,026
[Don] It's just the warm-up.

543
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,228
I need to get home and take a shower
and get ready for the day.

544
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,230
Do one quarter and just try it.

545
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,765
I kind of wanna leave.

546
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,968
[Khloé] Just do at least one quarter.

547
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,170
[sighs]

548
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,038
[Don] One leg up, we're going 30 seconds.

549
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,709
One, drop. Two, slow it down.

550
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,478
[Khloé] Kylie really just seems

551
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,513
like her head is not here this morning.

552
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,384
-You only did one quarter.
-[Kylie] I know.

553
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,319
There's three more to do
and possibly overtime.

554
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,854
[Don] You at least got to do half.

555
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,456
You know, Kylie being so young

556
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,658
and there's so much pressure
and focus on her life,

557
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,193
I could definitely understand

558
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,261
why she feels anxious a ton of the time.

559
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:46,098
But I know Kylie just has to find

560
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,367
what it is that will take away
that anxiety.

561
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,469
[Kylie] I love you, guys.

562
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,538
Think about if you did four,
how good you would feel.

563
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,639
[Khloé] Love you.

564
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,946
[upbeat music]

565
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,220
{\an8}[Khloé] Excuse me, can I help you?

566
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,254
[Mason] No.

567
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,022
[Khloé] Well, that's not how you shut it.

568
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,658
Put the stick back.

569
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,827
-Which one?
-That big one. Now pull it out.

570
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,229
Pull the drawer out.

571
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,731
There you go.

572
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,600
Everything has a home.

573
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,201
You have a home.

574
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,070
I do and you're in my home.

575
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,638
It's been real.

576
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,607
[Mason] It's been so good.

577
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,176
[Kourtney] Should we call Mom
and tell her we talked to Rob?

578
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,277
[Khloé] She's obviously known.

579
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,547
That's obviously why she was
tripping out like that

580
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,748
and not wanting to go,

581
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,850
and I think if she just knows
that we're cool,

582
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,952
then she'll feel better.

583
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:41,987
Yeah.

584
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,389
[phone ringing]

585
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,490
{\an8}[Kris] <i>Hello.</i>

586
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,792
{\an8}Hi, Mom.

587
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,461
-[Kris] <i>Hi there, pussycat.</i>
-Ooh.

588
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,097
How is Dubai going?

589
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,232
[Kris] <i>The jet lag is always
a challenge for me,</i>

590
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,168
<i>but other than that, it's all good.</i>

591
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,602
-<i>What's going on?</i>
-Well, nothing.

592
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,337
Kourt and I wanted to call you

593
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,740
because now we obviously talked to Rob,

594
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,577
and we now know why you were
so hesitant about leaving

595
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,179
and that we're all good over here,

596
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,214
and there's nothing you could do
if you stayed here,

597
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,615
so don't worry about that.

598
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,651
[Kris] <i>What did he say
when you talked to him?</i>

599
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:16,154
You know, just a lot, a lot to digest. Um…

600
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,857
[dramatic music]

601
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,592
You know, there's nothing we can do,

602
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,360
what's done is done, so…

603
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,595
[Kris] <i>Yeah.</i>

604
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,031
I don't know.

605
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,668
My mom was planning
on going to the Maldives

606
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,570
right after her Dubai trip.

607
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,971
She wants to be here for Rob,

608
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,841
but Rob and all of us sisters, we're good.

609
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,410
There's no reason
why she has to rush back home.

610
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,412
If anything, she needs this vacation

611
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,147
and she deserves this vacation.

612
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,782
[Kris] <i>Thanks for letting me know.</i>

613
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,884
<i>I'm fine now that you called</i>
<i>and you guys are there,</i>

614
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,219
<i>and it makes me feel better,</i>

615
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,120
<i>I love you, guys,</i> <i>and I'll be home soon. </i>

616
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,155
-<i>Bye, guys.</i>
-[Khloé] Bye.

617
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,423
Love you.

This looks nice.

621
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,540
I feel like we're on Fantasy Island.

[light music]

623
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,449
I was really anxious to leave town

624
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,151
at a time when my family really needs me,

625
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,454
but I got a call from the kids,

626
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,156
and everything's all good
with the girls and Rob.

627
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,061
[Kris] It just gives me the confirmation

628
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,163
that I really needed to take a minute

629
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,634
away from the situation and relax.

630
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,975
[Kris] Wow, this is so cool.

631
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,877
-Cheers.
-Cheers, baby.

632
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,480
[Kris] This is peaceful.

633
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,448
This makes you like
you're one of the fish.

634
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:51,550
Yeah.

635
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,151
-Look at the teeth.
-[Kris laughs]

636
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,820
[Corey] Why have rabbit teeth as a fish?

637
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,023
[Kris gasps]
Here comes the whole school.

638

-Yeah.
-It's like my kids.

Okay, if you were Kylie,
what fish would you be?

641
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,332
[Corey] I'm gonna pick out Kylie for you.

642
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,734
[Kris] Okay. It has to be, like, big lips.

643

644
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,372

-Uh-huh.

-There goes Kim.
-[Corey] Hello.

647

[Kris] That could be Rob.

651
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,186
I kind of miss the kids.

652
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,888
[Corey] We're almost home, baby.

653
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,590
Back to Hidden Hills.

654
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,361
Sometimes in life,
you just need to take a minute

655
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,330
and walk away from a situation

656
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:41,132
in order to see things more clearly.

657
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,634
I'm having another grandchild,

658
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,869
and I'm Rob's mom,

659
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:49,507
and I need to just be as loving

660
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,043
and positive as possible for him

661
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,778

Those two are pissed off.

[Corey] He's probably getting
after his bitch.

He like, "Girl, where the [bleep]

with anxiety for so long.

686
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,641
-[Kylie] It's just a thing.
-Like, you just get overwhelmed.

687
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,710
Yeah, some people are born for this life

688
00:27:58,777 --> 00:27:59,778
and some people aren't,

689
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,681
and I just know
I'm not supposed to be famous.

690
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,283
Like, I can feel it deep down inside.

691
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,324
{\an8}Some people are born for this life
and some people aren't,

692
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,127
and I just know
I'm not supposed to be famous.

693
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,264
Like, I can feel it deep down inside.

694
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,732
-[Kim] Really?
-Yeah.

695
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,467
That makes me so sad.

696
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,570
-I'm not supposed to be famous.
-I'm not either, for sure.

697
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:26,938
-Yeah.
-I am.

698
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,174
-[Kourtney] I think you are.
-[Kylie] I know you are.

699
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,608
Because you can handle it.

700
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,744
I can handle it,
I just don't give a [bleep].

701
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,846
I can't handle it, and I give a [bleep].

702
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,483
I care too much, I read too many things.

703
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,151
No, but I was like that.

704
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,388
At the beginning,
I would go out, I'd come home,

705
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,623
and I'd sit home
on the computer all night long.

706
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,524
Yup.

707
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,360
[Kim] I do sympathize with Kylie.

708
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:53,198
It does take really thick skin
to not read the comments.

709
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:56,701
And it took me
up until about two years ago

710
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,002
for me to get that way.

711
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,139
So I can understand that she is,
like, in the height of it all

712
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,941
and she has so much attention around her,

713
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,477
but your life is just so much better

714
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,145
when you don't pay
too much attention to it.

715
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,748
I used to literally spend all my days,

716
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,550
like, just worried about media and, like,

717
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,319
I was just so obsessed.

718
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,822
And then what happened?
You just stopped caring

719
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,390
and you realized
you couldn't please everybody?

720
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,825
Kanye didn't care,

721
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,794
so being around someone that, like,

722
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,129
-doesn't care as much…
-Doesn't care.

723
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,597
…you just let it go.

724
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,132
I couldn't even tell you the last time

725
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,333
I looked at a magazine,

726
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,034
-and I wouldn't even care.
-[Kourtney] Me neither.

727
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,504
[upbeat music]

728
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,472
[Kylie] I'm surprised to hear that Kim

729
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,041
struggled with being famous
in the past too,

730
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,643
and it does give me a little hope

731
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,212
that if she got through it, I can, too.

732
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,615
Yeah, it's just been like this
for too long.

733
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,416
Like, I'm way too young for this.

734
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,118
But don't you think that, like,

735
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,053
you're like a normal person at a party?

736
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,889
-Not really.
-Yeah.

737
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,423
I just don't like parties at all.

738
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,526
I know. On the way walking you
to the car, you're like,

739
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,729
"By the way, I hate parties."

740
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,897
I hate parties.

741
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,665
[laughter]

742
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,368
[upbeat music]

743
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,076
{\an8}Hi.

744
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,012
[man 1] We are here.

745
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,280
[Kylie] Should we talk about Lip Kit,

746
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,414
and go through
some of the stuff right now?

747
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,448
[Kris] Yeah.

748
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,050
So this is what they're getting.

749
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,152
The box is epic.

750
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,654
And then Kylie's note,

751
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,823
"Thank you so much
for purchasing your Kylie Lip Kit.

752
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,157
I hope you enjoy using it.

753
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,993
And I wanna thank you
for joining me on my journey."

754
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,095
Kylie, this is so good.

755
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,531
We have 25 minutes to go.

756
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,532
[Kylie mutters]

757
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,501
I know. I'm getting nervous.

758
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,236
[tense music]

759
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,172
[Kylie] I am stressing out right now

760
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,876
because today's the day
of my Lip Kit restock

761
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,312
and I really hope
that everything goes perfect

762
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,948
so that no one
has anything negative to say.

763
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,885
So I'm gonna post photo before,
and I'm gonna say,

764
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,521
{\an8}"All six shades are now available

765
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,989
on kyliecosmetics.com," right?

766
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,591
-Yes.
-Yeah, kyliecosmetics.com.

767
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,725
-[woman 3] Yeah.
-You guys,

768
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,360
we're, like just a few minutes.

00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,561
[all exclaiming]

770
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,231
Okay, guys, showtime, go time.

771
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,999
[Kris] Let's do this.

772
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,968
[Kylie] I'm scared, I'm scared.

773
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,404
[woman 4] This is how many people
are on the site right now.

774
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,472
[Kris] Fourteen thousand?

775
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,607
[Laura] Fourteen thousand.

776
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,875
-Wow.
-[Laura] We're up.

777
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,810
People have a feeling,
they have a feeling.

778
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,311
[woman 5] I'm having,
like, heart palpitations.

779
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,714
I know. Me too. I think
I'm gonna cry or something.

780
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,748
Okay, it's 8:59.

781
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,583
[Kris] Oh, look how people
are starting to jump on.

782
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,518
[Kylie] All right,
tell me when I can post.

783
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,288
-[Laura] It's 9:00, it's 9:00.
-Tell me. I just shared it.

784
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,389
-[Kylie] I did it.
-[Laura] It's 9:00.

785
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,391
[gasps]

786
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,559
[Kris] What?

787
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,861
[Kylie] It stopped. I think they literally

788
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,229
-just broke it.
-[Kris] What?

789
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,000
-[Kylie] It just stopped.
-[man 2] No, no, no, no, no.

790
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,167
[Kris] Is it broken already?

791
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,636
[tense music]

792
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,771
-Oh, [bleep].
-Oh, my god, you guys, you guys.

793
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,277
{\an8}[Kylie] It stopped. I think they literally

794
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,611
-just broke it.
-[Kris] What?

795
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,949
-[Kylie] It just stopped.
-[man 2] No, no, no, no, no.

796
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,284
[Kris] Is it broken already?

797
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,152
Oh, [bleep].

798
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,954
[Kylie] Oh, my god, you guys, you guys.

799
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,424
[Kris] Is it our site
or it's Shopify's site?

800
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,458
[man 2] It's the site.

801
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,893
-The site's down?
-[Laura] Shopify…

802
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,228
Shopify can't get in.

803
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,863
This is so stressful.

804
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,666
[Laura] Let's get Ryan on the phone.

805
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,567
[phone ringing]

806
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,802
{\an8}Hey, Ryan. Um…

807
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:21,472
{\an8}I can't get into the back end
of the Shopify admin. Can you?

808
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,108
[Ryan] <i>We're looking at that right now
but the site is open.</i>

809
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,143
<i>The IT guy, he says</i>

810
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,445
<i>you'll be able to log in</i>
<i>once we remove the cache.</i>

811
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,113
-<i>So they're doing it right now.</i>
-Cash?

812
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,282
-<i>I think they need to clear theirs…</i>
-Different "cache."

813
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,583
-Okay.
-[Laura] Okay.

814
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,918
-[Kylie] Oh, my god.
-[Kris] You're up?

815
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,053
-[Laura] I'm up over here.
-[Kris] Okay.

816
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,854
-So it hasn't crashed yet?
-[both] No.

817
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,291
The customer's
not experiencing any problems.

818
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,793
-It's just our end, Kris.
-Okay.

819
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,828
-So we're selling product?
-[Laura] Yeah.

820
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,497
[Kris] So almost 30,000 people
are on the site.

821
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,565
[Kylie] Amazing.

822
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,800
[man 2] What's it saying on social?

823
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,234
-[woman 5] "Bam, bitches."
-[Kris] "Bam?"

824
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,869
"Thank you for improving the site.

825
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,871
I got Posie and Koko easy.

826
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,306
It was such a pain last time."

827
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,808
-[people cheering]
-Oh, yay!

828
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,811
[Kylie] I just posted on Twitter.

829
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,079
Go get it, honey.

830
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,048
We're up over 70.

831
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,717
[exclaiming]

832
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,051
[Kris] Hundred thousand.

833
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,220
-Congratulations, Kylie.
-Yay, congratulations.

834
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,288
[Kris] Whoo!

835
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,856
Oh, now it's… now it's sold out.

836
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,324
In less than 30 minutes.

837
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,994
-[man] That was it.
-[all cheering]

838
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,062
That is really… it makes me happy.

839
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,897
-[Kris] Congrats.
-[woman 5] It paid off.

840
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,966
-[Kylie] Thank you.
-You're welcome.

841
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,702
This is just so exciting.

842
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,038
[Laura] Oh, my god, you're gonna all cry!

843
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,207
-I'm so proud of you.
-[chuckles, sniffles]

844
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,609
Proud of you, my girl.

845
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,645
I am so happy everything went perfectly.

846
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,014
The website didn't crash,

847
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,117
everybody's happy, except for the people

848
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,519
that weren't able to get it this time.

849
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,622
But other than that,
I'm just focusing on the positive.

850
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,993
Kylie, I think
you've just launched an empire.

851
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,597
[Kris] Congratulations, everybody.

852
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,233
[all cheering]

853
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,602
We kind of [bleep] rock.

854
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,337
-[Kris chuckles]
-Amazing.

855
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,173
[all cheering]

856
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,809
[upbeat music]

857
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,650
{\an8}What kind of couch is this?
[Khloé chuckles]

858
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,619
{\an8}-There's, like, no back to it.
-I know.

859
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,587
Well, there is
if you take this pillow away.

860
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,956
What happened to your couch
that was comfortable?

861
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,124
[Kris] I gave it away.

862
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,160
Look, and then
I can't even move my head back

863
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,661
'cause there's no back support.

864
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,897
Okay, well, I don't know
if you've noticed or not,

865
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,534
but everybody moved out of here,
and I had to do something.

866
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,601
[phone chimes]

867
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:37,175
Wait, Kylie and Chyna,
they were upstairs, Mom?

868
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,109
Yeah.

869
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,880
I'm just so confused.

870
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,783
{\an8}[Khloé] Seeing this picture
of Kylie and Chyna together,

871
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,919
{\an8}I legit thought
it was Photoshopped at first.

872
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,021
{\an8}I was like, "What am I looking at
right now?"

873
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,890
Well, Rob came over to have a talk.

874
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,859
Why didn't you tell me that?

875
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,928
I haven't gotten a chance to talk to you.

876
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,664
Kylie and Blac Chyna?

877
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,733
[tense music]

878
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:08,439
It feels so good to have had
the conversation with Rob and Chyna.

879
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,042
I said, "Look,
I just want Rob to be joyful

880
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,144
and happy and productive and…"

881
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:17,248
He goes, "Mom, I'm really happy.
This is what I want." So…

882
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,918
Just being with them and hearing
what they had to say,

883
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:26,057
and to see how in love
they are is amazing.

884
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,725
He's a grown man,

885
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,428
and he needs to make his own decisions,

886
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,396
and I need to let go a little bit.

887
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,767
-[phone ringing]
-[Khloé sighs]

888
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,404
{\an8}Did you forget to tell me something?

889
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,372
{\an8}[Kylie chuckles]

890
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,875
I just am seeing screen grabs
from Twitter,

891
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,343
and I'm like, "What?"

892
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,378
[Khloé] This is crazy. How was it?

893
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,280
[Kylie] <i>Should I just tell you
when you get here, the whole story?</i>

894
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,983
-[Khloé] You are a beast.
-[Kylie] <i>Let's talk when you get here.</i>

895
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,218
-<i>I love you.</i>
-M'kay. Love you, too. Bye.

896
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:00,258
It makes me so happy
that Kylie was able to be so mature

897
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,727
and sit down with her brother and Chyna

898
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:06,364
and really get some
of the past issues talked about.

899
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,433
The next step, I think,
is really for my other kids

900
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,736
to follow in Kylie's footsteps.

901
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,844
[upbeat music]

902
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,616
{\an8}[Harry] <i>What's new, Khloé?</i>

903
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,185
Oh.
[sighs]

904
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,720
{\an8}[Khloé] Not much.

905
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:30,922
So tired.

906
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,924
But that's not new.

907
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,058
Uh-huh.

908
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,627
[playful music]

909
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,865
Oh, what's new with you?

910
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,501
[Harry snickers]
This is the worst conversation, Khloé.

911
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,936
[laughs]

912
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,270
Who cares about small talk?

913
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,572
Yeah, true.

914
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,106
Make me so uncomfortable.

915
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,609
So, Kylie, are you gonna tell us?

916
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:52,543
Yes.

917
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,979
[Khloé] I need to hear what happened
with you and Chyna today.

918
00:36:56,113 --> 00:37:00,718
So pretty much, um, Rob called me
about the whole situation,

919
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,121
and I was just like,
"Look, I'm done. I'm over it."

920
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,224
And he was like,
"Just come in for the meeting."

921
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,859
Her and Mom were going back
and forth for a while.

922
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,728
Were they fighting or they were fine?

923
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,897
I mean, Mom was being kind of like Mom.

924
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,833
-[Khloé] No.
-Like, for sure.

925
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,602
-No.
-Yeah.

926
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,036
That's scary.

927
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,471
She was like, "I don't have
a problem with you guys,

928
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,607
I don't have a problem
with any of the sisters.

929
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,542
I swear I didn't do this out of spite.

930
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,244
Like, it just happened." This and that.

931
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,380
And then her and I were talking
about, like, Tyga a lot,

932
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,182
and, like, what went down
in the beginning,

933
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,185
because she was just like,
"You know, he would still text me."

934
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,520
And I already knew that.
Like, T told me everything.

935
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,257
Like, I saw all their text messages,
like, whatever.

936
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:43,160
I do think I'm still working
on finding ways

937
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,163
to let go of the things
that people say about me.

938
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,034
[Kylie] So I just told Rob
I want to talk to Chyna

939
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,004
because there's so much
misunderstanding going on

940
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,006
between her and I over social media.

941
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,641
[Kylie] We just talked a lot.

942
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,409
As I was talking to Chyna,

943
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:02,046
she had as much to say to me
as I had to say to her,

944
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,648
and I feel like a weight

945
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,883
has just been lifted off
both of our shoulders.

946
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,085
And I feel like that's all we needed.

947
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,089
And then I was like,
"We have to take a Snapchat

948
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,557
so the world knows."

949
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,959
-You said that?
-Yeah.

950
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,527
And then I just did the…

951
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,296
"We've been best friends the whole time."

952
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,264
I swear, I thought that was
a Photoshopped picture.

953
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,432
Everyone did.

954
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,000
So you guys are cool now?

955
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,136
[pensive music]

956
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,471
So that's that?

957
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:28,639
Yeah.

958
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,343
I think, at this point,

959
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,011
we all need to be one big happy family,

960
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,213
'cause some things we just can't control.

961
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,948
Like other people's lives.

962
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,785
And honestly,
I think you guys should talk.

963
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,988
It's like, people need to make up
and get over things, and, like--

964
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,524
I'm just gonna start
minding my own business.

965
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,592
No, because family is family.

966
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,529
I don't know why I would have
a sit-down with Chyna

967
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,664
'cause I don't have any issues with Chyna.

968
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,167
I find it weird that Rob doesn't think

969
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,436
him and I should have a sit-down
before anything else

970
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,137
because that's where the issue is,

971
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,639
is between Robert and myself,

972
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,641
and Rob can't just go into hiding.

973
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,077
[Khloé] I think the more space
Rob leaves between us,

974
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,079
it's… it's not just gonna fix itself.

975
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,581
Robert and I need to talk
about what happened,

976
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,084
how did we get to this place,
and how we could fix it

977
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,852
so we could never go back here again.

978
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,588
Who wants to have beef with someone?

979
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,324
-I don't.
-[Kylie] It's, like, tiring.

980
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,759
I don't like having a beef with anyone.

981
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,527
Beef is not fun, you know?

982
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:24,862
I just don't like beef.

983
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,265
I haven't had beef in years.

984
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,401
[laughs]
"I don't like beef."

985
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,736
[Kylie chuckles]

986
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,238
[upbeat music]

987
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,377
{\an8}[Khloé] <i>Who shut the door?</i>

988
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,611
{\an8}Who shut the door?

989
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,113
Did Kris Jenner do that to you?

990
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,848
Do you remember her? You lived with her

991
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:44,982
-for a minute.
-[Kris] Hi.

992
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,150
Yeah, but is it the same dog?

993
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,686
Because Gabbana,
I feel like, was more gray.

994
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,188
She's just happier,
so her hair turned back dark.

995
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,992
That's exactly why I went to the Maldives.

996
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,695
I wanted to be happier,
I had too much gray hair.

997
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,963
[Khloé] How was it?

998
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:01,265
It was really, really fun.

999
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,200
-We just, like, chilled.
-That's good.

1000
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,336
I just needed a minute because…

1001
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,471
I just felt really overwhelmed,

1002
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,707
and I didn't wanna just come
right back home

1003
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:13,411
before I took some time
for myself to breathe.

1004
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,012
-Mm-hm.
-[Kris] And just…

1005
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,081
digest everything that's been going on.

1006
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,382
Especially after Vail.

1007
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,753
Vail was a lot for me.

1008
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,356
I just think that all of us

1009
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,992
have been so caught up with,
like, all this Rob drama.

1010
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,627
It's just overwhelming.

1011
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,329
You know, there's this huge part of me

1012
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,632
that just wants him to be happy.

1013
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,903
[Kris] Khloé and Rob have always
been two peas in a pod

1014
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,237
and best friends.

1015
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,139
And it just breaks my heart

1016
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,842
that there's any divide
between the two of them

1017
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:48,279
whatsoever, especially over relationships.

1018
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,217
I think I cried myself
to sleep for three years

1019
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,020
just praying he would feel and get better.

1020
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,691
I was telling Kourtney and Kim, it's like,

1021
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,027
wait till your kids grow up and, you know,

1022
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:06,063
you face some real-life challenges
with everyone.

1023
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,233
And then you realize
what a mom really goes through

1024
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,769
even when her kids are adults.

1025
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:16,574
The next step, I think,
is really for Khloé to hopefully

1026
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,477
{\an8}have a great conversation
with Chyna and Rob,

1027
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,978
{\an8}and I think that

1028
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,415
{\an8}the more we all heal together
and bond together,

1029
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,383
the better life we're all gonna have.

1030
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,352
[dramatic music]

1031
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:32,857
[Kim] <i>Coming up next week…</i>

1032
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,426
Kanye's shooting the video in Iceland.

1033
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,861
This is unreal.

1034
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,396
Are you sad that you're not
with Kourt on her birthday?

1035
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:40,764
[Scott] Yeah, obviously.

1036
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,033
[Kim] We need to go straight to the video.

1037
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,802
We don't have time to go to the hotel.

1038
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,670
I'm starting to freak out.
I'm not gonna make it

1039
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,005
to Kanye's shoot in time.

1040
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,740
We may not make the video shoot.

1041
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,008
[Lamar] You should talk to your sister.

1042
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,576
[Rob] Whenever I talk to her,

1043
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,979
it just leads to yelling at each other.

1044
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,847
[Lamar] Look who I found.
