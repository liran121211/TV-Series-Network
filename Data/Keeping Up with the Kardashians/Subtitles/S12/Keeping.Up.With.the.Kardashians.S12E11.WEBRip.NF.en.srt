He just, like, did it on his own.

00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,396
-Then we've been saying it, so…
-[Kourtney] We were like,

"Make a cute face."

Shake your head. Mase, you know,

11

we used to say that to you all the time.

12
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,836
-"Shake your head."
-[Scott] And then we would say,

"Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you boot."

00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,775
That was, like, when we brought you home

-You put me in the garbage

17
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,512
and then you let me poop in it.

18
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,981
Yeah, I should've put you in the garbage
and let you poop all over the place,

19
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,449
-so I wouldn't have to deal with it.
-Yeah.

"You better figure this out.

00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,586
Figure out how to handle this kid."

22
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,056

this German Shepherd?

164
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,878
[Kylie] How cool would, like, our photos
be, like, of me and the dog?

165
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,015

and just have the dopest photos.

[Kris] Because I wanted samples.

Chris Brown, Rihanna,

that do what they wanna do.

It's really important to him
when he was writing this song, "Famous,"

-[Jen laughs]
-[Khloé] Wait.

00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,723
{\an8}[quirky music continues]

340
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,961
Hi.
[laughs]

341
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,496
[Jen] Your eyes weirdly look big.

342
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,398
Yeah, my eyes look [bleep] bizarre,

343
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,167
and I think it's your phone.
Like, I thought the app was on.

344
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,102
-So that's just what my eyes look like?
-Yeah.

345
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,438
[Jen] We can't change that.
There's no filter for that.

346
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,273
[phone ringing]

347
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,875
{\an8}[Kim] Hi.

348
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,177
[publicist] <i>They have an audio recording.</i>

349
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,612
[Kim] Shut the [bleep] up.

350
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,182
-[publicist] <i>I'm not.</i>
-[Kim] Shut the [bleep] up.

351
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,984
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

352
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,219
{\an8}It's Kanye, hold on.

353
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,721
-Oh.
-[Kim] Hey, babe. Um…

354
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,791
So, you know someone recorded you.

355
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,259
-[Kanye] <i>Okay.</i>
-[Kim] Um…

356
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,494
-He said, "Okay."
-When you were, like,

357
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,396
upset about Taylor.

358
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,199
The guy recorded the whole thing
and someone has the audio.

359
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,334
[Kanye] <i>Uh-huh.</i>

360
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,970
And you just, like, are, like, upset.

361
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,974
[Kanye] <i>I don't care. Like, I was mad.</i>

362
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,042
<i>Is that illegal for them to record me?</i>

363
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,677
-Not in New York.
-<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

364
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:39,778
[Kim] Not in New York.

365
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,881
-Not in--
-<i>Yeah, so, what, what…</i>

366
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,016
<i>I mean, does it start to seem unfair now?</i>

367
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,120
<i>I mean, if you think it's a big deal,
I'm gonna follow your lead.</i>

368
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,855
[Kim] I don't think it's a big deal.

369
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,991
It's just the way the perception is.

370
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,125
[Kanye] <i>Well, yeah.</i>

371
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,561
[Kim] All right, let me see
what the team wants to do

372
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,229
and says and all that.

373
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,865
Not that you care, but I'm just saying

374
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,133
I care what people think.

375
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,936
[Kim] I'm just like,
my full-time job is your publicist.

376
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,640
Kanye definitely just always,
like, speaks the truth,

377
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,475
says what he feels, says what he wants.

378
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,777
<i>He has no filter, he just says what he,</i>

379
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,279
<i>you know, believes in.</i>

380
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,447
And some people might not understand that.

381
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,083
<i>And so, like, he has a bad guy reputation.</i>

382
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,586
[Kanye] <i>If you want to do something
to help it out or fix it, I'm down.</i>

383
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,389
Maybe just, like, lay off Twitter
for a little bit.

384
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,457
[Kim] Let me see what the team says.

385
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,093
Usually, you know,
I always try to stay neutral,

386
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,530
<i>and, you know, really think
about where Kanye's coming from</i>

387
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,166
<i>and just, you know,
definitely try to give, like,</i>

388
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,534
moral support and input.

389
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,370
Don't you think, like,
I have to think smarter for him?

390
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,372
'Cause he's gonna say, "I don't care."

391
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,707
The wife of Pablo?

392
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,342
The wife of Pablo.

393
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,413
[upbeat music]

394
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,954
-[Åkerlund] Hi.
-[Kim] Hi.

395
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,223
-How are you? Nice to meet you.
-I'm great. Nice to meet you.

396
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,959
{\an8}-Come into my world.
-Oh, my goodness, who is this?

397
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,393
{\an8}This is my baby.

398
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,796
-What's her name?
-This is Beelzebub.

399
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,965
Hey, welcome to my world.

400
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,700
[Kim] This is so cool.

401
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:14,506
B. Åkerlund is an amazing stylist,
creative director.

402
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,709
She is doing the Fergie video.

403
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,444
So cool.

404
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,112
[Kim] Love this.

405
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,381
<i>I'm excited to meet with her today</i>

406
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,950
and, you know, just see
what her vision is for me,

407
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,652
'cause I really have no idea.

408
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,787
[Åkerlund] I mean, just to give you,
like, a general,

409
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,189
like, overlook of the video.

410
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,592
We really, like, wanna,
like, lift up all the women.

411
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,662
If it's a woman breast-feeding,
or whatever they're doing, that,

412
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,464
I mean, they still look like
they're in Italian <i>Vogue</i>.

413
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,632
-So that…
-That's, like, so been my motto.

414
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,169
If anything, I felt, like,
sexier after becoming a mom.

415
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,438
I had a curvier body after becoming a mom.

416
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,906
-You can be hot and be a mom.
-Yeah.

417
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,342
[Åkerlund] That's what
the whole concept is about, powerful moms.

418
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,011
And obviously, you're one of them,

419
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,447
so we wanna, you know, showcase you
and, sort of…

420
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,648
But I could show you.

421
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,918
[Åkerlund] So, we want you
to have your own "Got MILF" ad,

422
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,854
which will, like, pop up on the TV.

423
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,990
I don't know what speaks to you
the most as a person.

424
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,658
Like, if you had to explain yourself

425
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,360
in, like, three words, what would it be?

426
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,529
I hate describing myself, but…

427
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,898
[Kim] I mean, I would definitely say
sexy is one of them.

428
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,366
-[Åkerlund] Mm-hm.
-And I think,

429
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,769
if I were to do an ad like this,

430
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,506
like, I like the ones
when the girls are, like, wet

431
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,241
and, like, dripping milk on them,

432
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,876
-and, like, that vibe.
-[Åkerlund] Okay.

433
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,077
Should be in the shower.

434
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,745
[Åkerlund] Like, should we do a swimsuit?

435
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,147
Yeah, I think so.

436
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,015
Like, a special swimsuit that…

437
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,350
-[Kim] Yeah.
-…sucks everything in.

438
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,851
Do whatever you want with me.

439
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:33,919
-[Åkerlund] Okay.
-You know, just…

440
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,954
-make me look skinny.
-[laughter]

441
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,958
Meeting with B., I definitely know

442
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,060
that I'm in really good hands.

443
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,661
Like, she's got it.

444
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,496
<i>Her references were insane.</i>

445
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,632
What she's planning on having, you know,

446
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,834
custom-made, is just gonna look so good.

447
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,804
<i>So I feel like this is gonna be so major.</i>

448
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,206
I'm… I'm really getting excited now.

449
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,041
{\an8}[Fergie] <i>Hello.</i>

450
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,210
{\an8}-Hi.
-[Fergie] <i>Hey.</i>

451
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,412
I'm, like, obsessing.

452
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,814
[Fergie gasps over phone]

453
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,749
[Fergie] <i>I know. It's gonna be so fun.</i>

454
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,186
<i>Well, you are in good hands with B.</i>

455
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,655
<i>Uh, I can't wait to see</i>
<i>what you guys come up with.</i>

456
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,723
-<i>It's gonna be so good.</i>
-She'll take the milk shower,

457
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,225
you'll take the milk bath.

458
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,327
-[Fergie] <i>Okay, perfect.</i>
-[laughs]

459
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,895
-Yes.
-[Fergie] <i>Perfect.</i>

460
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,497
Okay.
[laughs]

461
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,432
Well, we'll get in a bath together.

462
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,633

463
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,769
[upbeat music]

464
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,512
[Kourtney] What are you gonna get?

465
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,247
Salad?

466
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,483
I have no idea if they have anything else.

467
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,152
They do. I mean, they have,
like, sandwiches and stuff.

468
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,221
[Kourtney] I used to get
a tuna sandwich once in a while.

469
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,157
[Khloé] Okay, so while we're at lunch,

470
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,127
we're basically trying
to teach Kylie, like…

471
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,896
-[phone ringing]
-…her lesson. And Kim, I swear to God.

472
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,798
Oh, it's Kim, speak of the devil.

473
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,934
{\an8}-Hey.
-[Kim] <i>Hey.</i>

474
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:59,037
{\an8}<i>So, Steph is gonna come</i>
<i>and she's gonna set it all up.</i>

475
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,839
Oh, my god, that's amazing. Okay.

476
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,508
-[Khloé] We'll be there distracting her.
-[Kim] <i>It'll be so good.</i>

477
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,609
[Khloé] So good.

478
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:08,914
Because Kylie has been so casual
about this security issue,

479
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,985
my sisters and I decide
to do a little prank on her

480
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,686
<i>to give her a wake-up call.</i>

481
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,989
I think Kylie needs to understand

482
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,423
that this is not a joke.

483
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,058
We're gonna make sure, like,

484
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,028
when we walk out with her,
that we think, like…

485
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,062
That we're like…
[gasps]

486
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,864
-[Khloé] Like it's serious.
-Make it a serious thing,

487
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,666
instead of being like, "Ha-ha-ha-ha."

488
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,468
Right. She's not gonna know,
at this point,

489
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,036
that it's us doing it.

490
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,505
[Kim on phone]
<i>Yeah, we got to, like, scare her into it.</i>

491
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,941
<i>She needs to take this seriously.</i>

492
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,176
Agreed.

493
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,578
I don't think it's a bad idea to play

494
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,446
a harmless prank on Kylie.

495
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,948
[Khloé] Hi. What a cute bag.

496
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,083
And hopefully, kind of scare her a little.

497
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,521
I think just showing Kylie
how easy it is to reach her

498
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,890
might, like, rattle her up a little bit.

499
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,560
[Kourtney] Are you buying
horny goat weed extract?

500
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,595
-Yeah.
-[Kourtney] Mm-hm.

501
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,664
Horny goat weed extract,

502
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,731
-what is this?
-[Harry] Yeah.

503
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,366
-I saw "horny" and I got excited.
-I saw "horny"

504
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,701
and I got excited.
[laughs]

505
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,037
-And then I saw "goat."
-"Goat" made me really excited.

506
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,305
-[Harry] Yeah.
-[laughs]

507
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,839
[Harry] And the "extract" part, yeah.

508
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,042
-[laughter]
-Oh.

509
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,781
Cute.

510
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,919
I'm not surprised Kylie is Snapchatting

511
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:24,923
and not concerned
about our location being known.

512
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,859
And so this is exactly
why we're doing the prank.

513
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,561
[Khloé] Okay, Kourt, we gotta go.

514
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,729
[Kourtney] Okay.

515
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,201
-Ky… where's Kylie?
-[Kylie] Say what?

516
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,336
-[Kourtney] Oh.
-This way.

517
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,139
Go, this way.

518
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,809
-[Kylie clears throat]
-[indistinct chatter]

519
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,744
[car horn honks]

520
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,212
-[man 1] Right over here.
-My car? You moved it?

521
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,081
Yeah. Uh, Kourtney,
we pulled your car up here.

522
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,549
-What's on my car?
-Uh…

523
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,050
[Kourtney] What is on your car?

524
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,086
[upbeat music]

525
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,688
[Khloé] Who did that to your car?
Is that your car?

526
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,957
[Kylie] <i>Oh, my god.
I have no idea what's going on.</i>

527
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,592
I am freaking out.

528
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,027
I'm just gonna wait till they take it off.

529
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,996
[Kourtney] Come here. Let's go look at it.

530
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,063
[Kylie] Why?

531
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,765
'Cause, let's go see what it is.

532
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,400
[Kourtney] You only live once.

533
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,269
[Kylie] No, you guys did this.

534
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,770
It was nothing about us.

535
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,939
-[Kourtney laughs]
-[Kylie] Very funny.

536
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:17,509
<i>I can't really understand
why Kourtney would do this.</i>

537
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:22,214
The paparazzi are definitely
gonna release these photos.

538
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,682
<i>It's embarrassing.</i>

539
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,951
[Kourtney laughing]
Kylie. Kylie.

540
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,289
[upbeat music]

541
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,529
{\an8}-[Khloé] So, Kourt.
-[Kourtney] Huh?

542
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,264
[Khloé] What were you saying
about [bleep] fast?

543
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:46,071
I said some guys jerk it,
so they can last longer.

544
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,240
Yeah, but I don't think
there's anything wrong with that.

545
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,142
I'm not saying there is at all.

546
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,810
We're going to Hef's at 12:30.

547
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,513
[woman] What do you do
if you bump into Taylor Swift tonight?

548
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,082
[Khloé] I mean, I don't know Taylor Swift.
Why do I care?

549
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,216
[phone chimes]

550
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,651
-Call Kim.
-Okay.

{\an8}[line ringing]

552
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,722
[Kourtney] Hi.

553
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,491
Uh, whatever happened
with the Taylor Swift video?

554
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,826
[Kim] <i>The clip is so good.</i>

555
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,695
<i>So the line, when she said,</i>

556
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,830
<i>"I made her famous," or whatever,</i>

557
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,665
<i>I heard she told everyone at the table,</i>

558
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,434
<i>like, "Well, I mean, it's true, whatever.</i>

559
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,370
<i>Kanye totally, like, made me more famous."</i>

560
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:22,474
<i>And so, that's what Kanye came up</i>
<i>with the line, but whatever.</i>

561
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,343
So why don't you… I'll put it out.

562
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,577
-What's wrong with you?
-Yeah, but it's like, why…

563
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,712
I don't know. 'Cause, like,

564
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,980
why do you even wanna
get into this battle?

565
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,216
[Kim] <i>I just wanted to, like,
kind of stay out of it.</i>

566
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,118
Don't let Khloé post it.

567
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,286
[Kim] <i>No, don't.</i>

568
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,021
<i>I don't want any of us to get involved.</i>

569
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,422
-Yeah.
-[Kim] <i>Okay, bye.</i>

00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,458
-Bye.
-[Khloé] Kourt, come here.

[pensive music]

573
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't really feel like saying much,

574
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,836
<i>because the Taylor Swift fans…</i>

575
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,971
love her, and I'm all for that.

576
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,773
And all I know is,

577
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,274
<i>I saw the video.</i>

578
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,009
I've heard Taylor,

579
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,845
<i>and I think
that Kanye did the right thing.</i>

580
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,581
So… Please, Taylor Swift fans,
don't kill me.

581
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,751
-What do you think about that?
-[Khloé] That's not okay.

582
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,787
I know how it is when people are,

583
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:09,988
like, attacking your husband,

584
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,191
<i>and I know that Kim feels
that Kanye did the right thing.</i>

585
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,060
You don't have to do that as a songwriter.

586
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,595
You could really just say
whatever you want.

587
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,131
<i>It's so easy to just go ahead
and attack Kanye,</i>

588
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,400
<i>'cause they already perceive him
in a negative way anyway.</i>

589
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,903
I really hate that he gets
such a bad rap for everything.

590
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,473
I mean, what do you think about the video?

591
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,209
It's just funny.

592
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,979
Everyone's so full of [bleep].

593
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,815
So full of [bleep] that it pisses me off.

594
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,619
[upbeat music]

595
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:48,460
{\an8}[Khloé] Hello, Don.

596
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,895
{\an8}[Don] How your body feeling?

597
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,363
{\an8}Fine, but you know my quad.

598
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,831
-[Don] Right.
-We got to, just see.

599
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:53,965
[Don] Mm-hm.

600
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,134
Mind right, body ready.

601
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,104
Mentally, zone in, focus.

602
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,373
I'm gonna start doing
the, uh, upper body with me.

603
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,342
So just cushion down,
when the arms go down, light jump.

604
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,578
Let's go. One, drop.

605
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,280
Two, perfect.

606
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,081
Three, drop.

607
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,484
Good, four. That's the pace I want.

608
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,352
Five, don't speed that up. Six.

609
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:17,088
I've got to get it together
and get myself in shape

610
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,491
for this "MILF Money" music video.

611
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,692
<i>I'm really nervous, though.</i>

612
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,994
But if Chrissy can do this,

613
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,164
and she had a baby two weeks ago,

614
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,467
I definitely can get it together,

615
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,635
like, four months later.

616
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,505
[Don] Four, cushion. Five, cushion.

617
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,541
Let's go. One, drop, up.

618
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,144
Two, drop. Squeeze the arms.

619
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,378
Good.

620
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:43,281
You know, with Kim,
she just, like, you know,

621
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,749
puts being a mom first,

622
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,686
but she takes time to work out,

623
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:48,887
eat well

624
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,256
and just feel her best.

625
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,125
[Don] Oh, the roll down. Let me see this.

626
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,261
-Let's see it.
-[Don] I remember those days.

627
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,396
-[Kourtney] Good job!
-[Don] Yeah.

628
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,397
Good work. Good work.

629
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,299
[upbeat music]

630
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,806
{\an8}-[Kris] Hey.
-[Kourtney] Hi.

631
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,908
Hi, Reigny. What are you doing?

632
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,243
[Kris] Give me a little kiss.

633
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,677
Show me the face.

634
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,946
[laughter]

635
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,781
-[Kourtney] Did he do it?
-Yes.

636
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,350
You're so cute.

637
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,551
How come you're so cute?

638
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,785
Show me the face.

639
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,121
Your mama used to do that.

640
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,856
Yeah.
[laughs]

641
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,492
-You're so cute.
-[Reigny coos]

642
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,794
[Kris] So what is going on with Kylie?

643
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,863
She was so upset.

644
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,632
Called me, hysterical, crying.

645
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,534
Said she never wanted to go out

646
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,968
and hang out with you guys again

647
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,169
-because she felt, like…
-[Kourtney] Well no, we all went…

648
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,471
-…really disrespected.
-…to lunch.

649
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,072
[Kourtney] And then
we were walking out to the car.

650
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,340
It just, was a bad day.

651
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:46,011
There was so many people around,
so many paparazzi,

652
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,213
and so, I think
she was just like, "What's going on?"

653
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,314
And then I was like, "Come on,

654
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,615
let's go to your car and see it."

655
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,618
You know, I think she's just young still

656
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,221
and trying to do so much,

657
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,989
and she's got so much on her plate.

658
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,793
It's still a really new, big world for her

659
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,295
because she just turned 18,

660
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,363
so she's got this world of responsibility

661
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,932
that she's just trying to get used to.

662
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,633
One of the things
that's stressing her out,

663
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,502
and she doesn't really talk
about it at all,

664
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,270
is the whole stalker situation.

665
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:16,308
She's had to change
her whole computer system,

666
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,009
she's had to up her security,

667
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,946
hire more bodyguards, and get a new phone.

668
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,547
It's a lot to go through

669
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,550
when someone starts threatening
your existence

670
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,218
and just the way you live your life.

671
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,520

what you're doing
on these sexy shoots, girl.

840
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,198
I really have no idea.

-[Fergie] Yeah, you do. Babe.

842
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,903
-[Kim] Thank you.
-Thank you.

843
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,671
I cannot wait to see this.

844
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,540
Thank you. Thank you so much
for everything.

-[man] Yeah. Yeah.

-You too.

I have my <i>Cosmo</i> interview coming up.

852
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,437
[Kim] Do you get nervous for them?

853
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,607
I never did. I'm like, "Why do I care?"

854
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,242
[Kim] Yeah, who cares?

855
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,211
I just shot <i>GQ.</i>

856
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,512
-[Kourtney] How was it?
-It was good.

857
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,749
She asked me questions like Rob and Chyna,

858
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,418
random OJ questions
that no one really asks me,

859
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,253
but maybe because that show came out.

860
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,888
My publicist is gonna die.

861
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:47,125
She asked me how do I feel when Kanye,

862
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,961
like, raps about having sex
with other girls.

863
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,995
Mm-hm.

864
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,564

867
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,240
<i>like, how do I feel that Kanye…</i>

868
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,709
<i>talked about having sex with Taylor Swift?</i>

869
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,315
I kind of just, was really truthful
and said how I felt.

870
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,685
I never talk [bleep] about anyone,
like, publicly, like,

871
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,120
especially in interviews,

872
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,589
but I was just like, "I've so had it."

873
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,259
I just felt like I wanted to,
like, defend him in it.

874
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,427
[Kourtney] Mm-hm.

875
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,463
'Cause it's like, she legitimately…

876
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,832
quote, says,

877
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,369
"As soon as I get on
that Grammy red carpet,

878
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,505
I'm gonna tell all the press,
like, I was in on it."

879
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,308
And then she just didn't like
the reaction?

880
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,678
Yeah, and, you know,
just another way to play the victim.

881
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,781
Definitely got her
a lot of attention the first time.

882
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,818
I just don't think
that he should be punished

883
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,653
for it still to this day.

884
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,721
I feel like I've had it

885
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,991
with people blatantly treating
my husband a certain way

886
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,426
and making him look a certain way.

887
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,262
<i>Kanye is always so honest
and speaks his mind.</i>

888
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,431
<i>And, you know, when we were first dating,</i>

889
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,767
<i>everyone would talk [bleep]
and he always had my back.</i>

890
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,669
<i>At this point,
I really don't give a [bleep],</i>

891
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,904
so I'll do whatever to protect my husband.

892
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:10,741
Yeah, Kanye, you know,
definitely, like, hurt her

893
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,643
years ago when he did that,

894
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,779
and it wasn't meant to be personal.

895
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:15,713
It could've been anyone.

896
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,316
'Cause, like, we all know
that "Single Ladies"

00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,019
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-So I think

899
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,387
when she didn't win,

900
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,690
he just wanted to stand up for it.

901
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,026
I'm so glad that you said the truth.

902
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,229
[Kim]
Yeah, I'm just, like, speaking the truth.

903
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,831
Like, he called her, spoke to her.

904
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,300
She even helped him, like, rewrite.

905
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,035
-Yeah.
-It's so wild.

-No.

-for that prank.
-Mm-hm.

00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,942

I just don't think that we realized,

922
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,343
like, what a scene…

923
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,812
I feel like we should've known
the second we got there,

924
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,781
and there was, like,
thousands of people outside.

925
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,717
-It was just too many people.
-It was too much to do that,

926
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,286
so we should've, like, stopped it.

-Yeah.
-…when there's too many fans

929
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,658
and paparazzi is already stressful.

930
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,793
And then the balloons,
and the guy was videoing,

931
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,695
and then, like,
you just, like, weren't sure,

like, who was in on it.
Like, it was just too much.

So, I just wanted to say sorry,
but I think

934
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,804
it is, you know, important

935
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,207
to, like, take it seriously
with the stalker.

00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,209

if I'm out in public

with the snapping,

938
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,446
like, I'll turn to airplane mode
and then you post them later.

[Kris] And be respectful.

1008
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,096
Maybe she just took it the wrong way.

<i>I mean, at this point, I'm just over it.</i>

1010
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,868
Like, yeah, am I annoyed

1011
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,137
that people try to pin my husband

1012
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:09,073
<i>as this bad guy
to, like, take advantage a little bit?</i>

1013
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,875
<i>But, at this point, like,</i>

1014
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,309
I know the truth,

1015
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,045
I know everyone around me knows the truth,
we all do,

1016
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,447
<i>so it is what it is.</i>

1017
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,816
<i>You know, there's nothing
we can really do about it.</i>

1018
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:22,953
{\an8}My advice is that you give Taylor a call

1019
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,455
{\an8}and try to make amends.

1020
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,824
Thank you for your lovely advice.

1021
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,960
-[Kris] You're welcome.
-But I'm not going to take it.

Keeping Up with the Kardashians…

1023
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,233
Are you excited for Cuba?

1024
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,035
[Kanye] It feels like we're in a dream.

<i>Dorothy, you're not in Canada anymore.</i>

1026

[Khloé] <i>Canada?</i>

1027
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,540
[Kris] Hey, Kylie.

1028
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,475
You look so cute and pretty.

1029
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,043
All my sisters are in Cuba,

1030
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,845
<i>and she doesn't know
what to do with herself.</i>

1031
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,381
-Mom, you're acting a little crazy.
-Okay.

1032
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,483
He was, like, waiting for me
to leave town.

1033
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,353
I've been trying to contact Lamar,
but I am unable to.

1034
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,389
<i>Definitely makes me nervous.</i>
