[doctor]<i> I'm well, how are you?</i>

49
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:04,190
I'm good. So, Lamar's coming in
to see you at, um, five today.

50
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:08,895
And he was just in a coma a few months ago

51
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,598
and he's on a ton of medications
for that stuff,

52
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,066
but they vary every week,

53
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,435
so it was hard for me
to fill out that form.

the best care possible.</i>

Okay, thank you so much. Bye.

Don't apologize. You're so kind.

Got his nails done this morning.
He's in a massage right now.

00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,716
He's gonna go to the eye doctor at five,

61
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,584
and then a dermatologist
is making a house call

62
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,486
to his house
'cause his skin is breaking out.

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,921
Bam.

64
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,656
I don't know what he would do without you.

00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,258
He doesn't know.

66
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:43,129
Lamar has definitely come a long way

67
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,866
since his whole hospital situation.

68
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,903

a lot of my life on hold

to try to help Lamar
and get him on a great track.

00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,876
But, you know, internally
there's still so much that

71
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,746
Lamar has to fix about himself.

[pensive music]

00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,117
I thought you were calling
a doctor for yourself.

74

For something, like,
oh, God, forgot my gynecologist

75
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,424
wants to make an appointment with me,

76
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:15,128
and then it's like
9,000 things about yellow.

77
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,863
I just want him to focus
on positive things,

78

-so I don't care.
-Yeah.

with us, though.

is doing a fashion show in Cuba.

-[Khloé] Yeah, you and I,

chill with Kendall,

00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,091
like, whatever we can do.

90
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,593
So I think it's gonna be super cool

91
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,661

that we're allowed to go there.

'cause all I hear

00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,001
is that people are buying
property over there to like--

to stop you from buying a house?

-I would… I, honestly,

so it would make me

And I need to start pushing
myself to do things

110
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,303
that are more for me,
instead of for everybody else.

-[Malika] Cuba!

115

{\an8}[Khloé] Like, you guys take
everything from me

116
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:52,292
and that's, like, a known fact,
but you have the balls, though,

117
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,528
to take something
that's so identifiable to me

118
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,531
and my personality and my home, right?

119
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:02,035
And this started by me saying to her,

120
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,438
"Oh, my god, you didn't give Mom
that Marilyn Monroe painting

121
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,739
that's in her kitchen?"

122
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,174
"Oh, I thought you gave it to her."

123
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,609
"She has the same exact one."

124
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,678

125
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,613
-Are you [bleep] out of your--
-[Kris] I don't want…

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,248
I don't even want it
if it's the same print.

127
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,986
Mom, I'm obsessed with Marilyn.
And I… it's, like, my thing.

128
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,788
I have the Larry Schiller one…

129
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,257
[Kim] Like, I looked at the
Larry Schiller ones years ago,

130
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,959
but I knew that was
Khloé's thing. I love Marilyn.

131
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,528
[Khloé] Mom?

132
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:29,696
[Kris] Oh, sorry.

133
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:36,369
Okay, well, uh, this Cuba trip,
Kim, Kourt and the kids,

134
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,705
and Malika, and Kanye,
and all of them were all--

135
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,306
We decided we all want to go.

136
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,709
We think it's gonna be so much fun.

137
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,545
Like, if they're doing
this Chanel fashion show

138
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,848
and everything there, like,
it's got to be safe and--

139
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,883
Kendall's supposed to walk in Chanel.

140
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,885

-But I will tell you guys

141
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,522
-[Khloé mutters]
-…that there's no Internet…

142
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,359
If we're with our whole family,
who needs to call anyone?

143
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,728
Uh… me.

144
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,930
Why wouldn't you come?

145
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,366
I'm not going to Cuba. I… I can't.

146

If there's no communication…

147
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,502

148
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,940
[Kris] The girls wanting to go to Cuba
is a little stressful for me.

149
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,642
I feel very anxious about not being able

150
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,578
to communicate with them
while they're gone.

151
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,748
You don't communicate
either way. Can't reach you…

152

153

to Cuba, have fun.

154

I'm gonna really enjoy

about you guys being in Cuba,

159
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,030
I can have some peace and quiet.

160

All right, guys, well, I'll enjoy my time,

161
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,904
and you guys let me know
when you get back,

162
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,073

can't send me an email

163

[Khloé] Oh, my god. This way!

169
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,324
KoKo, I got a jellyfish stung.

170
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,126
What? You got stung by a jellyfish?

171
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,561
-[Mason] Uh-huh.
-Where?

172
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,662
-[Mason] Right here.
-[Malika] No way.

173
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,230
I did, too, before.

174
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,466
-Where's my huggie?
-[Malika] So, what did you do?

175
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,168
[Kourtney] We put vinegar on it.

176
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,602
[Khloé] Masey, guess what?

177
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,072
One time, I got stung
by a jellyfish two times.

178
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,408
-Aw, Mase.
-Say KoKo.

179
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,476
[Reign babbles]

180
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,978
KoKo! Hi, Reigny.

181
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,247
[Kourtney] It sucks that Kendall
couldn't make the trip.

182
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,617
The whole reason
we were even going to Cuba

183
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,688
was because Kendall was walking
in the Chanel show there,

184
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,257
but because of last-minute changes,

185
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,625
Kendall has dropped out,

186
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,395
so since we all have our travel plans,

187
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,531
we're all still going, and I'm so excited.

188
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,366
-Is Kim coming?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

189
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,734
-Oh…
-[Kourtney] Not here, though.

190
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,670
-She's meeting us there.
-[Khloé] Oh, it's just us?

191
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,005
So we're gonna party on this plane?

192
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,907
What are you talking about?

193
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,610
[Kourtney] And Kim and Kanye
are in New York,

194
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:01,214
so they are going to meet us in Cuba.

195
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,882
[rumbling]

196
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,718
Khloé, did you guys spray
yourself with DEET?

197
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,988
Yeah, I brought us, like,
refills enough for four days.

198
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,958
I don't mess with, like, real bug spray,

199
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,125
but I'm not taking a chance.

200
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,627
We, like, doused ourselves,

201
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,562
'cause I don't want to get the Zika.

202
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,998
-[Malika] Yeah.
-[Penelope] Oh no.

203
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,533
[Kourtney] That is Cuba.

204
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,135
Never been, but we're going
as a family together,

205
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,403
this is so exciting.

206
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,006
Are you excited for Cuba? Are you?

207
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,307
-Yeah.
-What are you--

208
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,742
We're on a world tour.

209
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,080
[Khloé] So Scott couldn't get into Cuba?

210
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:37,316
He wanted to come,
but he told me the night before.

211
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,584
And he was like,

212
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,220
"I'm getting a jet. Let's go."

213
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,488
Is he coming?

214
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,491
I don't think that
he could get his traveling.

215
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,727
It's like really hard,
I guess, to get a visa.

216
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,130
Scott decided at the last minute

217
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,099
that he really wanted to come to Cuba,

218
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,269
but you need, like, visas
and all this paperwork

219
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,504
to be filled out that takes,
like, weeks and weeks,

220
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,273
so he wasn't able to make it.

221
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,408
Were you fine with him coming?

222
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,543
Yep.

223
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,281
I said, "Come on down to Cuba town."

224
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,682
[Khloé] Yeah!

225
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,417
-We're landing already?
-[Penelope] Already?

226
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,320
[Khloé] Five more minutes, we're landing!

227
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,857
I am annoyed, like,
that I don't have contact

228
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,026
to anybody that's not with us.

229
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,029
Like, the fact that I can't use
my phone does disturb me.

230
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,230
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-It bothers me

231
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,298
and that's my prerogative,

232
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,568
like, Kim has her husband
and her babies with her,

233
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,403
you have all your babies with you,

234
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,904
and then it's just me and Malika.

235
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,006
Like, we want to be able
to talk to our friends

236
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,641
or whatever.

237
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,876
-And I want to be--
-[Kourtney] Guess what?

238
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,945
-No, but you get…
-Friends schmrends.

239
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,546
[Khloé] That's why you guys
aren't tripping out

240
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,447
about your cell phones.

241
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,049
You guys are with all your family.

242
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,317
[Kourtney] Right.

243
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,155
It's definitely scary
to go to another country

244
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:53,326
and then not have any access to back home.

245
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,495
Lamar knows that it's not easy to reach me

246
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,131
because our cell phones
don't work in Cuba.

247
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,736
And there's, like, one hotel
in all of Cuba that has Wi-Fi.

248
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,907
That's just a nerve-racking thought.

249
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,546
{\an8}[upbeat music]

250
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,420
[Khloé] Hi.

[Malika] Very excited.

-Malika, how pretty is it here?
-It's amazing.

253
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,994
We got the car that I wanted.

254
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:29,996
Yes.

[woman] Hi.

257
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,368
I'm just so excited.

258
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:39,305
I love getting out of town,
I love seeing new places.

259
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:44,243
Cuba is now open to Americans.
Like, I'm just so excited,

260
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,546
I feel like, to witness
such a piece of history.

261
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,815
And we got your seats in here, guys.

262
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,284
And be able to bring our kids

263
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,654
and, like, all go together
and make memories.

264
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,490
[Khloé] Oh, I've already been bitten

265
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,625
and I have Zikia or whatever
the [bleep] it is.

266
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,827
Where did you put the DEET,
Khlo? I can spray you.

-You have it, in your purse.
-You just need to be overloaded.

Look at the goats.

282
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,329
So the goats are, like,
people's dogs, almost.

283
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,665
[Khloé] Yeah, they're one with nature.

284
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,768
All the colors are so pretty,
on all the buildings.

285
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,637
Yes, in Cuba the people like the colors.

286
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,805
I love it.

287
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,873

-I love it.
-[Malika] You meet people

in United States and they look
at you like you're crazy.

I love that there's history and culture.

294
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,590
People are outside,
and they're walking the streets

295

and everyone is, like,
enjoying other people.

it's refreshing to see that.

[Malika] We should set a goal.

To walk away from this trip

amazing trips we've ever had.

00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,691
[Kanye] I know.
Isn't the lightning so crazy?

339
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,593
Crazy, crazy lightning.

340
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,728
Let's go like this. Whoo!

341
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:50,996
[North whoops]

342
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,231
No, wait till the lightning…

343
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,333
[North whooping]

344
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,901
-No, we gotta see lightning.
-No, wait.

345
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,036
-Wait for the lightning.
-[North whoops quietly]

346
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,904
-[thunder rumbles]
-[Kim and Kanye gasp, whoop]

347
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,906
-[North] Whoo!
-See? She's like, "What?"

348
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,041
[North whoops]

349
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,108
-What?
-[North] Whoo!

350
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,544
-[thunder rumbles]
-[all whooping]

351
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,147
[Kim] When we first get to Cuba,

352
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,616
it really is exactly how I imagined it.

353
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,918
Like, nothing's really changed in decades

354
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,887
and it's so amazing,

355
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,989
and I'm so glad we came at this time.

356
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,626
-[Khloé] It's so beautiful.
-Yeah.

357
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,895
[Khloé] Come here, Mase Dumbledore.

358
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,631
[chanting] Dumbledore! Dumbledore!

359
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,733
-Spotless door.
-Mason is a Dumbledore!

360
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,371
Mase, why did you, like,
make a peef on your juje?

361
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,273
They made my butt liberated.

362
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,641
[Khloé laughs]

363
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,509
Kourt, what are we doing?

364
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,112
We are walking the streets of Cuba

365
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,047
with my friend, <i>mi amiga</i>.

366
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,216
-Berta.
-[Khloé] Hi, Berta.

367
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,684
Hi. And is your name?

368
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,719
Kourtney.

369
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,521
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

370
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,857
I love to just be free,

371
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,627
especially in other countries and cities,

372
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,362
and just, like, explore.

373
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,565
That was their house. Did you see
inside the window of their house?

374
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,633
No, Kourt.

375
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,735
This is life. This is life, Khloé.

376
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,637
This is life in Cuba.

377
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,206
It's so fun to be able
to just walk the streets

378
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,443
and talk to local people
and see how other people live.

379
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,545
And it feels like we're living life.

380
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,181
[Malika] Dorothy, you're not
in Canada anymore.

381
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,217
-[Khloé] Canada?
-Kansas.

382
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,618
[laughter]

383
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,086
[Malika] This is fun, see?

384
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,591
[indistinct chatter]

385
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,625
[Kim] How cool.

386
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,093
[indistinct chatter]

387
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,361
[Malika] Hi.

388
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,497
What?

389
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,932
[Kanye] Yo, can you come here?

390
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,702
I think when you film,
you should film it with the camera in it.

391
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,836
You know what I mean, like…

392
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,305
Get the full view.

393
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,540
-This is Kourtney, Mason…
-How are you?

394
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,108
-Malika.
-[Malika] Hi.

395
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,176
-[Kourtney] He films everything.
-[Khloé] I was just like,

396
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,111
"Who is filming us with that,
like, VHS camera?"

397
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,546
-[Kim] He just likes to film.
-Like what is happening?

398
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,381
Well, he films… he films me.

399
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:54,186
Kanye always has his eye out
for a young generation

400
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,422
of, like, really creative people.

401
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,658
And Kanye's been working
with this young filmmaker

402
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,262
who is videoing everything
that Kanye's been doing.

403
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,965
So he's here in Cuba
just to capture our trip.

404
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,467
[Khloé] Kourt, what are you drinking?

405
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,703
I might have sangria.
It's, like, my favorite.

406
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,671
[Khloé] I'm sure it has to be
good here, right?

407
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,841
You guys, the pres who dropped the mic,

408
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,177
this is where he came
and he sat here, Obam.

409
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,245
-At this table?
-Obama sat at this table.

410
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,182
And when Michelle needed
to use the restroom,

411
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,683
they put a toilet seat over it,

412
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,719
because there's nothing to sit on,

413
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,154
you just gotta cop a squat
and pray for the best.

414
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,357
You guys, copping a squat is my thing.

415
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,858
-[Khloé] I know.
-[Kourtney] They don't know.

416
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,126
[Khloé] Well, they're going to…

417
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,228
Are all sangrias like this?

418
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,564
-What a fun beverage.
-[Malika] How is it, Kim?

419
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,734
-Good.
-So she called me.

420
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,335
-[Malika] Mm-hm.
-[Khloé] And was like,

421
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,070
"We need to talk to you about Lamar."

422
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,906
And I was like, "Okay."

423
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,175
And she was like, "I am really sorry,

424
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,212
I don't know what to say.
Lamar just asked for cash."

425
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,681
So she's giving it… She has
to get it to him in the morning.

426
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,950
-Do you guys want some?
-No, thank you.

427
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,021
[Khloé] I am his, like, advisor,
if he's… something's wrong.

428
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,323
-But, like, technically…
-I just feel so bad.

429
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,290
…he's of sound…

430
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,293
-You feel so bad for what?
-Like… you.

431
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,165
Khloé, you can't do…

432
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,567
You've done everything you can do.

433
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,369
You can't control him.

434
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,239
You want to try and be the best,
but honey,

435
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,142
if he wants to run himself
back into the gutter,

436
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,877
he's gonna do just that.

437
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,613
But who's with him that's even
gonna, like, let him…

438
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,282
[Malika] He may ditch everyone.

439
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,217
We don't know exactly what he's thinking.

440
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,986
It doesn't mean
that someone's gonna let him.

441
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,455
Or is he just gonna run away
while we're here?

442
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,224
[tense music]

443
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,793
I already know why he was, like,

444
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,262
waiting for me to leave town,
waiting for me.

445
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,197
And he knows my phone doesn't work.

446
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,198
-Yeah.
-He doesn't know

447
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,766
that I got Wi-Fi in the room.

448
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,102
What a [bleep]. He was waiting for this.

449
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,540
This is what he used to do
when you would leave town?

450
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,475
Every time I'd leave town,
when we were married,

451
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,810
did this happen.

452
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,346
I just didn't think he would
still do the same thing.

453
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,820
[Kourtney] Can you pass the olives, Kim?

454
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,254
[Khloé chuckles]

455
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,123
-Do you like Kourtney's outfit?
-[Kanye] Yeah.

456
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,227
Is this like the dress you wore
to your first Met appearance?

457
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,262
Yes, this print right here? Yeah.

458
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,530
Your appearance.

459
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,665
-[Kanye] Your first appearance.
-Appearance.

460
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,400
-Yes, please.
-[indistinct muttering]

461
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,535
How did you feel about your blue eyes?

462
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,271
-How did I feel about them?
-He can hardly see.

463
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,372
Oh, you could?

464
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,508
No, they were…
they were thick plastic things.

465
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,743
I don't understand that question.

466
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,279
No, no, let me just tell you,
the question is,

467
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:38,117
"How did you feel about your blue eyes?"

468
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,753
That's like if Kim had on
a blonde wig and I said,

469
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,555
"How did you feel about your blonde hair?"

470
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,990
[Khloé] That's
a passive-aggressive question.

471
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,792
It didn't sound like you liked them.

472
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,193
No, it's like, did you like the look?

473
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,062
[Kanye] How do you feel about your choker

474
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,163
that you're wearing?

475
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,298
[laughing]

476
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,933
[Malika] Do you know
what I love about you?

477
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,034
What?

478
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,138
There are often moments
that I just want to say

479
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,673
exactly what I'm thinking and I don't.
[chuckles]

480
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,941
[Khloé] Yeah.

481
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,678
You guys, Kanye and I
got into a fight in Iceland.

482
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:07,913
[Khloé] What about?

483
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,015
About this whole topic.

484
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,452
-[Khloé] Thank you.
-[waiter] You're welcome.

485
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,954
So everybody got the same thing?

486
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,089
Basically.

487
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,058
But back to…
Okay, I'll answer the question.

488
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,261
I felt very good about my contacts.

489
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,896
-[Khloé chuckles]
-I felt very…

490
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,231
No, I could tell Kim was into it.

491
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,167
[chuckles]

492
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,137
{\an8}[upbeat music]

493
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,346
{\an8}So, let's do this, gang. Let's earmark.

494
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,782
So, Claire, get some stickys, honey,

495
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,384
take all the products.

496
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,652
-[Claire] Okay.
-[Kris] We'd like to give

497
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,488
all of the Kardashian
beauty stuff that we have

498
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,424
{\an8}to the, um, underprivileged women…

499
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,426
-[Claire] Mm-hm.
-…downtown for Mother's Day.

500
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,162
Let's look and compete for these ladies.

501
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,864
If there's product here…

502
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,499
Ooh, boy.

503
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,968
This is what happens
when they went to Cuba?

504
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,637
-[Claire] It's outrageous.
-[Kris] Oy, boy.

505
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,540
Matt, where's Khloé's assistant?

506
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,642
-[Matt] I can track her down.
-Yeah.

I haven't been here in so long,
it feels good.

511
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,822
I was able to email Kim, like, twice.

512
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,558
I haven't talked to them
since they've been in Cuba.

513
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,126
They're not posting anything.

514
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,429
So I was just hoping that they were okay.

515
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,533
Even though I already knew
the communication would be bad,

516
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,201
it's like crickets over there.

517
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,271
I can't believe that they're out there
having this great time

518
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,907
and probably not giving me
a second thought.

519
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,042
And I'm sitting on pins and needles,

520
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,911
waiting to hear anything.

how much I miss them, you know?

that they're right there to call

[Kourtney] Okay.

533
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,718
I almost didn't come to Cuba because,

534
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,353
like, all of the old-fashioned cars,

535
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,756
you can't put car seats in them

536
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,958
because there's no seat belts at all,

537
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,193
so there's nothing to strap
the seats into.

538
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,864
But, in Cuba, like, nobody's in a rush,

539
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,033
and it just seems like everybody

540
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,635
is much safer, like, with the driving.

[Kanye] She didn't…
She didn't respond to me.

[Kourtney] Did she say,
"Dad, are you trying to say

-you don't like my diamonds?"
-[Kanye] No. But now I understand.

00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,724
[Grethel] So these are, uh,
some of the Havana Club products.

681
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,428
We are at Havana Club
and I'm so excited to see

682
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,465
a rum distillery
because Cuba makes the best rum,

683
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,101
and just to smoke cigars, drink some rum,

684
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,203
be like really Cuban for the day.

685
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,106
[Grethel] From this one on
is part of our iconic collection.

686
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,541
The one that you're going to try

687
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,444
{\an8}is our very, very special product here,

688
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,614
{\an8}the extra-aged rum Máximo.

689
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,518
It's a work of our grand rum master
José Pablo Navarro.

690
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,454
He has been working
for the brand for 42 years.

691
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,523
-Pablo?
-José Pablo Navarro.

692
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,557
José Pablo.

693
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,792
-What's his name?
-Pablo, Pablo, Pablo.

694
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,493
-Pablo. One more Pablo.
-[Kourtney giggles]

695
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,062
[Grethel] Okay, follow me.

696
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,065
[Kim] Even though
I'm not that big of a drinker,

697
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,167
I'm enjoying all the memories
that we're gonna have

698
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,935
and it's really cool just to, like,

699
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,171
soak up what the culture is here.

700
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,940
Rum doesn't age in the bottle.
It ages only…

701
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,575
-[Khloé] In a barrel.
-…in the, uh… in the barrel.

702
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,278
So, once it's in a bottle,
it can't age anymore?

703
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,014
-[Grethel] No, not in the case of rum.
-Interesting.

704
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,551
[Grethel] So, uh,
the tasting we do with, uh, cigars

705
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:42,721
and rum is called <i>sobremesa</i>.

706
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,824
<i>Sobremesa </i>is something you do,
generally, after you eat dinner.

707
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,725
Okay.

708
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,928
[Grethel] It's that you chill
at the table. You share with your friends,

709
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,330
you share a drink, a cigar, dessert…

710
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,899
Americans don't do that enough.

711
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,434
Americans are rushing

712
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,037
and always wanting
to go to the next place.

713
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,371
I like it.

714
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,807
I like this Cub… this Cuban moment.

715
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,944
[upbeat music]

716
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,147
[Kourtney] I think
that last one's the best.

717
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,284
-Come on over, "ropa."
-Check what I missed, right?

718
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,986
-Is that it?
-[Khloé] I like that one.

719
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,388
[Kanye] I'm actually super into this

720
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,724
because I like fire and I like alcohol.

721
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,993
-Right up your alley today.
-[Kanye] I really like cigars.

722
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,730
[Malika] Hey, Kimmy, I see you.

723
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,699
[coughs]

724
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,900
[Grethel] Oh, oh, one thing.

725
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,869
-Don't inhale the air, okay?
-Yeah, she told me,

726
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,670
after I did ten times.

727
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,906
-What is the point of this then?
-[laughter]

728
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,775
-[Kim] Does anyone want mine?
-Khloé does.

729
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,777
[Khloé] Not really.

730
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,080
[Kourtney] Did you get a good video?

731
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,049
[dramatic music]

732
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,485
I'm trying to make an effort
to be in the moment,

733
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,655
but being away from the hotel
and being unreachable

734
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,924
is just not, like, a settling feeling.

735
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,296
{\an8}[upbeat music]

736
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,701
[Malika] Aren't the buildings pretty?

737
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,136
-[Penelope] Right now?
-[Malika] Yeah.

738
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,005
Okay, on the left now,

739
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,108
is the cemetery of Havana.

740
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,544
It's the biggest cemetery
in Latin America.

741
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,413
The name is Necropolis of Columbus.

742
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,148
That's crazy.

743
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,984
[Malika] That's a beautiful
church, Armando.

744
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,754
This is the San Francisco de Paula Church.

745
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,455
-Oh, it's so pretty.
-This church…

746
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,991
This church used for maternity hospital
in 17th century.

747
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,193
Wow.

748
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,828
[Armando] It's beautiful building.

749
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,062
[Khloé] Beautiful building.

750
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,431
I can probably ride through this town

751
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,667
all day long, just, like, looking.

752
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,202
[Khloé] Yeah, it's so cute.

753
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,971
Don't you feel like if you
had someone with you in LA

754
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,072
and you had to drive them around,

755
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,007
wouldn't you just say,
"This is the Valley"?

756
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,409
Right.

757
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,779
{\an8}[upbeat music]

758
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,654
{\an8}What if I just, like,
dipped myself in the water?

759
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,256
Mm-hm. That would be perfect.

760
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,358
That it would be,
like, super wet and cool.

761
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,659
[photographer] Amazing. Stay right there.

762
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,628
[upbeat music]

763
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,929
[camera shutter clicking]

764
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,701
I am doing a photoshoot

765
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,870
for one of my new lip kit colors,

766
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,906
and it's just so exciting
to be a part of something

767
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,108
that I have always wanted
since I was little.

768
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,645
[female staff] He always tried to escape.

769
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,647
[Kris] Hey, Kylie.

770
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,082
[camera shutter clicking]

771
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,184
[Kris] Oh, that looks great.

772
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,387
You look so cute and pretty.

773
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,058
Everyone's been in Cuba now for a few days

774
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,128
and I have a little more
free time on my hands.

775
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,063
Now I can focus on Kylie a little bit.

776
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,833
[Kris] Have you heard from your sisters?

777
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,934
[camera shutter clicks]

778
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,169
[Kylie] No.

[camera shutter clicking]

780
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,208
I haven't heard from anybody
in, like, two days.

781
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,443
[tense music]

782
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,178
[camera shutter clicking]

783
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,481
M'kay.

784
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,851
I mean, you want to have
a conversation? What's up?

785
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,522
[Kris] I'm just not used
to not hearing from anybody.

786
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,058
[Kylie] My mom shows up.
I didn't invite her.

787
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,559
All my sisters are in Cuba,

788
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,495
and she doesn't know
what to do with herself,

789
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,397
so she's harassing me.

790
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,333
It feels really awkward not being able

791
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,901
to talk to anybody or check in.

792
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,470
[Kylie] Mom, you're acting a little crazy.

793
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,571

-We are the judges.
-Mase, we're here.

That's how… Ain't that how
you enter in convertibles?

-[Kim] Yup.
-Look at the water, Mase.

00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,739

-<i>♪ You've got the magic… ♪</i>
-Babe, don't say that.

-Oh, sorry.
-You know what that is?

-[bleep].
-Oh, sorry.

to sit next to KoKo.

-It's good to be an aunt.
-[Khloé] You know what?

Don't have kids, don't need them.

814
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:14,959
Khlo, Kanye and I
had a discovery in the car.

815
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,794
-What?
-[Kourtney] He said that he realized…

816
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,229
'cause he said to North,

817
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,532
-"Hey, North, do you like your diamonds?"
-[Reign] KoKo.

818
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,968
And then he said, "The way that I talk

819
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,370
is how I talk to a kid."

820
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,139
And I said, "I swear I woke up
in the middle of the night

821
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,874
and thought that to myself."

822
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,243
And I said to Kanye, 'cause he's like,

823
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,413
"I would never say anything intentionally
to hurt your feelings."

824
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,582
I think you two
are just not vibing right now.

825
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,484
No, no, we are. We are.

826
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,419
[Kanye] So what's worse?

827
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,087
Uh, intentionally trying to hurt me

828
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,223
or talking to me like a child? [chuckles]

829
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,693
That's the way I like to be communicated
with anyway, mostly.

830
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,062
-Yeah. I keep it simple.
-[Kanye] Yeah.

831
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,597
I get it. [chuckles]

832
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,299
[Kim] You know they have, like,
potato rations here,

833
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,269
so, like, you can only get
a certain amount,

834
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,637
-'cause there's not a lot.
-[Khloé] Thank you.

835
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,538
[Kanye chuckles]

836
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,741
[Kourtney] Khloé went out
of town and Lamar kept asking, like,

837
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,777
"When are you leaving?
When are you leaving?"

838
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,212
And the day she left, he asked for cash.

839
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:09,781
For what?

840
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,682
[Kourtney] What do you think?

841
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,117
[Khloé] What?

842
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,186
[Kourtney] Just telling him about Lamar.

843
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,555
But you're so upset, but…

844
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,491
But doesn't he want to start
playing ball again?

845
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,061
[Khloé] He never wanted
to stop playing ball,

846
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,296
but you just can't live
that lifestyle and do that.

847
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,265
And I tell him, without discouraging him,

848
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,501
I'm like, you know, like…
Let's, like, focus on coaching,

849
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,003
like, Kobe just retired.

850
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,773
But his motor skills
are not what they used to be.

851
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,008
[Kanye] Yeah.

852
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:41,312
He was such a great athlete
and didn't even try.

853
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,581
Like, that's him not trying.

854
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:48,486
When he got off the Clippers
is when he started doing that.

855
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,391
And he didn't finish his therapy
to get better.

856
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,026
And that was his choice.

857
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,527
He told me and Malika when we were there.

858
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,029
I was like,
"Why are you sleeping all day?"

859
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,131
And, like, Malika was there,
like, "You got to get up,

860
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,733
it's a beautiful day. Like,
go on a walk or something."

861
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,702
And he was like, "I just have
thoughts now, at night."

862
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,737
[dramatic music]

863
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,974
And I was like,
"Well, what do you think about?

864
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,709
Like, that's why I said
you need to go to a counselor,

865
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,344
'cause I don't know how to help that.

866
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,180
I don't have those thoughts
and I want you to get better."

867
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,819
[Kim] It's really hard
to see Khloé so stressed out.

868
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,255
And I wish she wouldn't put
that much weight

869
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,557
of this whole situation on her shoulders,

870
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,826
but I think that's just who she is.

871
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,995
I wish she would just enjoy herself…

872
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,499
and wouldn't put herself through that.

I can tell that my mom needs

a little extra attention right now.

913
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,927

that she has too many children,

915
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:16,133

-Really?
-Yeah.

920

'Cause it means you still
want to hang out with me

You're not all grown up, yet.

923
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,850
So this gets sautéed, with the garlic,

924
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,253
for about five minutes.

925
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,021
And you put the carrots in first,

926
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,956
because they're the most dense,
and they're hard.

927

-[Kylie] Yeah.
-You know?

-No. Oh, yeah.
-'Cause it's got

-[Corey laughs]

00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,823
you really listen to your mother,

00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,225
-which is great.
-She does.

everyone in Cuba,

951
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,770

957
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,516
And I think she can feel

958
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,751
that I'm missing the other kids so much,

959
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,220
that she wants to come over
and keep me company,

960
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,789

And that's the house of Hemingway.

00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,341
In 1928, it was the first time
Hemingway visit Cuba.

980
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,478
Only 48 hours, but was enough.
He was in love.

981
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,546
When Hemingway received a special guest,

982
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,515
he used to ring the bell to say "welcome."

it's not luxury in the house.

Everything is simple,
but nice and practical.

991

One of the most interesting
things here is on the wall.

-[Kim] It's like me.
