00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,705
{\an8}[Khloé] How's everything
on the home front?

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,874
{\an8}-[Rob] I mean, it's been tough.
-[Khloé] You have to worry

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,310
{\an8}about, Rob… and how you could be strong

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,278
{\an8}and better for you, and now your baby.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,346
{\an8}Don't you want to get

6
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,081
{\an8}-your [bleeps] together?
-[Rob] I do.

7
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,550
{\an8}We're gonna go out of town for a month.

8
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:18,985
{\an8}-Is Scott going?
-No.

9
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,587
{\an8}[Scott] This is gonna be
the longest I'm away

10
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,022
{\an8}from the kids and Kourt ever.

11
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,124
{\an8}-[Khloé] How do you feel?
-Well, I'm kind of anxious.

12
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,692
{\an8}[Scott] Any time I have
too much time on my hands,

13
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,494
{\an8}I'm not exactly sure what to do.

14
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,563
{\an8}[upbeat music]

15
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,405
{\an8}[Khloé] Gabbana, go in and get it.

16
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,640
{\an8}I accidentally threw the ball
in the Jacuzzi,

17
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,075
and she just, like, can't figure it out.

18
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,143
Is she in there just chilling?

19
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,677
[Khloé] It's right there, isn't it?

20
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,913
Just get on the step. Look.

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,983
-[Gabbana barking]
-I know, I'm trying to show you.

22
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,987
I don't get it. You'll jump in a pool,
you won't jump in a three-foot hot tub?

23
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,023
-[Khloé] Go!
-There's a [bleeps] staircase here.

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,359
[gasps] She went on the step, you guys.

25
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,194
[Scott] Uh-oh, gettin' it.

26
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,663
-Good girl, finally.
-Okay.

27
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,865
-There you go.
-Yeah.

28
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:06,933
[Scott] Whoa!

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,735
-This dog's a champion.
-[Khloé] Good girl.

00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,638

00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,214
{\an8}[upbeat music]

32
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,824
[Khloé] Oh, Northie, come here right now.

33
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,992
-[Khloé squealing]
-[Kris] Northie.

34
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,062
[screams]

35
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,263
Hello.

36
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,099
[Khloé] Why are you so cute?

37
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,901
-What am I gonna do?
-Say hi to Uncle Robbie.

38
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,170
Did you say hi to Uncle Robbie?

39
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,005
Hey.

40
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,108
See what happens when you go
in hiding for three years?

41
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,376
So how the hell are you, haberstran?

42
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,744
[Rob] I'm good.

43
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,347
[Khloé] Are you and, like,
Chyna better, though?

44
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,516
Yeah, we're, like, completely all good.

45
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,551
-Oh, good.
-[Rob] Yeah, everything's good.

46
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,787
[Kris] You know what I was thinking, guys?

47
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,522
-MJ's birthday is coming up…
-[Kim] Mm-hm.

48
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,591
[Kris] …and I thought
we could all go down there

49
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,526
and have dinner with her for her birthday.

50
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,863
And we could take her
to the races the next day

51
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,030
-at Del Mar racetrack.
-[Khloé] Oh, cute.

52
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,832
-She likes that?
-[Kris] Her favorite thing to do

53
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,901
-is go to the races.
-[Kim] Can I bring the kids?

54
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,169
-[Kris] Yeah.
-I'm in.

55
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,303
[Kris] She would love that.

56
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,139
And Kourtney's going
to be back from her trip,

57
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,573
so she'll bring her kids, too.

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,642
But we could go down
and take her to dinner.

59
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,744
And we'll invite Chyna
so she can get to know her

60
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,912
-a little better.
-[Rob] Yeah.

61
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,514
That would be so much fun.

62
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,384
I really think it's important
that we go and celebrate

63
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,454
my mom's birthday with her
and bring the whole family.

64
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,290
Rob hasn't seen her in a long time,

65
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,360
so with Rob coming,
and if Chyna comes with him,

66
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,229
I think she would really,
really be excited.

67
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,898
Why do you have a bowl of marbles?

68
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,499
The bowl of marbles represent

69
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,535
how many weekends I have left in my life.

70
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,303
-[snorts]
-[Rob] What?

71
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,038
-How do you know, though?
-[Kris] Assuming I would live

72
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,007
-till 80 or 85.
-[Khloé] What happens

73
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,775
when you have four marbles left?

74
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,478
I know. I didn't think about it like that.

75
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,647
-[Khloé] Like, that's horrible.
-[Kim] Is that why they say

76
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:04,083
-you're losing your marbles?
-[Kris] I'm losing my marbles.

77
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,718
That's where the term comes from.

78
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,388
[upbeat music]

79
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,627
-[automated voice] <i>Turn left.</i>
-[Khloé] Oh, shut up!

80
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,529
-Hi.
-Fresh shave?

81
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,164
-Laser?
-I get laser hair removal.

82
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,166
-Look… You can't see my hair?
-You look real shiny.

83
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,068
-I have hair. Just little stubs.
-Nothing.

84
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,236
-[Khloé] Look, you can.
-Nothing.

85
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,204
[Khloé] They're little,
but look how thin they are.

86
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,572
-Oh, there.
-See?

87
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,374
How is real estate?
Like, flipping? Is that, like,

88
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,809
preoccupying your time and stuff?

89
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,978
You know, I mean, listen, all
the real estate stuff is great.

90
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,279
It's just at the end
of the night, when I lay

91
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,847
my head down on the pillow and I'm alone,

92
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,417
and it's, like, I know my kids
are across the country,

93
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,420
I just feel, like, super alone sometimes.

94
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:44,123
It's just tough, 'cause, like,
I see pictures she posted,

95
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,459
and, like, she'd send me videos
of the kids,

96
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,494
-and I'm just, like…
-That's good, though.

97
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,097
[Scott] It's amazing.
I don't want it any other way.

98
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,067
But then it just makes me
miss them more and more.

99
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,103
[Khloé] I get it's hard for Scott
to be away from Kourt and the kids,

100
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,172
but Kourtney and Scott are co-parenting,

101
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,374
and this has to be their new normal,

102
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,110
them having separate family vacations.

103
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,212
But that doesn't mean
that he should let this

104
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,281
dictate his happiness.
He can't just be miserable

105
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,350
'cause his kids are with their mom.

106
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,753
It's just sad. Like, it's just weird when,

107
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,055
you know, memories
are happening and I'm not there.

108
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,391
And that's usually when I get,
like, upset.

109
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,028
[upbeat music]

110
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,536
{\an8}[Kris] I think we all have our,
like, individual style

111
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,772
that we just wear every single day.

112
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,906
Kim's into kimonas…

113
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,408
-What's a "kimona"?
-I was in robe because

114
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,110
-I was resting.
-It's a kimon-o.

115
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,544
-Kimono, kimono.
-[Khloé] Do you want me

116
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,014
to tell you what your style is?
You wear black?

117
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,116
No, no, can I tell you what her style is?

118
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,985
-Your style, yeah.
-Whatever I wear.

119
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,187
[Khloé] You guys, I'm worried about Scott.

120
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,589
I feel like he's in, like,

121
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,724
kind of like a low point in his life

122
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,127
with Kourtney and the family gone.

123
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,462
And you just, like,
get in a rut and you stay in it.

124
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,997
Don't you know about that lifestyle?

125
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,132
-I do.
-Right.

126
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,267
[Kris] I like it when
he was always really dressed up.

127
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,536
It reminded me of, like,
the Frank Sinatra days.

128
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,873
Well, I mean,
I miss the Lord version of Scott.

129
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,275
He needs to shave and wear a pocket scarf.

130
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,577
No, the beard has changed his life,

131
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,346
so he could be the Lord in other ways.

132
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,915
[Khloé] The last that I remember

133
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,884
that Scott was, like, fun and silly

134
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,520
was when he embodied the Lord.

135
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,922
[Simon] With this crown,
I crown you Scott Disick,

136
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,057
the new Lord of the Manor.

137
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,492
-[bell dings]
-Long live His Lordship.

138
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,428
What's up, London? Lord Disick is here!

139
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,663
[Khloé] He was always dressed to the nines

140
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,065
and was always, like, really elaborate,

141
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,466
-over the top.
-[Scott] Going up.

142
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,401
[Khloé] That looks great, Scott.

143
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,602
[laughter]

144
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,438
[Scott] Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

145
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,474
Tonight we dine like gentlemen.

146
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,910
But I feel like lately Scott's been, like,

147
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,946
forgetting to have fun
and takes life too seriously.

148
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,550
So I do wish that we got some more
of the Lord version of Scott.

149
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,786
And maybe help him find
some happiness just for him.

150
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,321
[Khloé] When you talk to me, what do you…

151
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,522
What's your focal point?

152
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,359
-Like, what do you stare at?
-I don't know. Nothing bad.

153
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,227
-[Khloé] Oh, are you sure?
-[Rob] Yeah.

154
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,062
'Cause you look at my teeth a lot.

155
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,897
And I'm wondering is something in them?

156
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,599
It's hard for me to talk to somebody…

157
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,368
What… You just looked at my teeth again.

158
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,502
-What's in them?
-[laughs]

159
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,371
Nothing, they're good.

160
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,307
[upbeat music]

161
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,950
-[waitress] Edamame.
-Thank you.

162
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,419
[Larsa] So what's going on
with Miss North?

163
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,287
{\an8}-Thank you.
-[Kim] She had her…

164
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,989
{\an8}second violin lesson today.

165
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,891
-She loves it.
-Oh! That's so cute.

166
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,459
She's, like, so obsessed.

167
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,495
The teacher was like,
"She's gonna learn to read music

168
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,430
before she can read the alphabet."

169
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,466
That's so cool. Sophia's like,
"North is so lucky.

170
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,402
Her dad is gonna teach her how to sing,

171
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,371
like how Daddy teaches the boys
how to play basketball."

172
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,672
[Kim] So cute.

173
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,674
Do you have to do the boys' hair?

174
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,876
[Larsa] No, the boys do their own hair.

175
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,210
You just have to keep their hair short.

176
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,345
[Kim] Then you don't have
to worry about it.

177
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,413
Yeah.

178
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,448
But Sophia's hair is, like, work.

179
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,151
Like, Sophia just started
not crying when I wash her hair,

180
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,585
'cause it would get so, like, knotty.

181
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,487
And, like, brushing through the back part

182
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,489
of her hair was always, like, work.

183
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,058
[Kim] I've got to figure out
how to do North's hair.

184
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,728
I can do her hair in a ponytail or a bun.

185
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,263
[Larsa] That's cute.
I love her hair in a bun.

186
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,398
But she'll be like,
"I want a braid like Elsa."

187
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,167
-I like how they love Elsa.
-[Kim] Totally,

188
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,068
but I'm not that good
at braiding her hair,

189
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,637
and I really want to learn how.

190
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,706
North is so proud of her curly hair,

191
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,675
but she's very opinionated

192
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,343
on how she wants to wear her hair.

193
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,779
And as a mom, you don't want
to have to tell her,

194
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,347
"I don't know how to do your hair."

195
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:32,251
It's, like, such a prideful thing
to be able to make her look pretty

196
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,187
and make her feel confident.

197
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,354
It's important to me.

198
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,957
North said to me,
"Mama, you want curly hair?"

199
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,726
And I said yeah, and she goes,
"Okay, how you get curly hair,

200
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,695
you get a spray bottle, and you go…

201
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,663
[crunching]

202
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,264
…and you scrunch, scrunch, scrunch.

203
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,999
And that's how you get good curls."

204
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,501
And I'm like, "Okay."

205
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,136
[Larsa] She already knows how
to do her own hair.

206
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,871
-[Kim] Okay.
-That's so freakin' cute.

207

209
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,250
{\an8}When I'm a mouse.

210
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,886
The dog filter doesn't work.

What's this new Snapchat on Instagram?

212
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,456
I don't know. I don't like change.

213
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,391
I just got used to this Snapchat.

214
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,860
[Kris] Hey, guys.

215
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,461
-[Khloé] Hey, Mom.
-Hey, LD.

216
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,530
What in God's name are you doing?

217
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,434
This is for you.
We're bringing back the Lord.

218
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,035
-[Scott] What the…
-[Kris] Yeah.

219
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,637
-This is epic.
-[Scott] Should I have

220
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,638
-every one of these hanged?
-[Kris] Ep… ic.

221
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,374
We miss the Lord, okay? So bring it back.

222
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,811
My mom and I decided that
we want to try to prevent

223
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,713
any more of our family
members from being, like,

224
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,948
stuck in a dark, sad place.

225
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,385
So why not show Scott his old Lord swag

226
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,755
and see if he misses it
the way we miss the Lord?

227
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,323
You know what this is.

228
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,526
-Is that from the Hamptons?
-[Kris] Yes, it is.

229
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,328
You guys don't call me
a hoarder for nothing.

230
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,730
Look how gorgeous you are.

231
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,465
I've always wanted
to wrap myself in velvet.

232
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,300
-That was on the flagpole?
-[Kris] Yes.

233
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,802
I never knew you guys
wanted the Lord back so bad.

234
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,139
I actually thought the Lord
was a bit on the obnoxious side.

235
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,407
Oh!

236
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,309
-Oh!
-Oh, my God.

237
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,610
-Okey dokey.
-I'm not mad.

238
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,713
But the Lord does
bring out another side of me.

239
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,115
-[Khloé] Oh, my God.
-[Kris] Exactly.

240
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,884
This is exactly what I'm talking… about.

241
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,753
[Scott] I'm not gonna lie.

242
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,256
Seeing all my old, uh,
Lord paraphernalia feels pretty good.

243
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,759
I mean, I just felt like
when I was a lord,

244
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,494
I was flying all over the world,
getting in trouble.

245
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,330
But if everybody wants it,
I'm more than happy to bring it back.

246
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,798
[Kris] Look what I found.

to ask you something.

I have a real question.

00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:00,466
{\an8}So, I want to know how to, like,
isolate my upper thighs

{\an8}-and make them, like, wiggle.
-<i>Okay.</i>

262
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,136
[Khloé] How do I do that?

263
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,605
<i>You just, kind of, like, wiggle your legs.</i>

264
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,607
-Am I doing it? Am I doing it?
-[Chyna] <i>Like your thigh muscles.</i>

265
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,375
-She's wearing jeans.
-[Chyna] <i>You can't have</i>

-<i>on jeans, though.</i>
-Oh, okay.

267
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,845
[Chyna]<i> And then, once that wiggles,</i>

268
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:13,980
<i>then your ass wiggles.</i>

00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,649
[laughs] Yes.

you got to really teach me in-depth.

[Chyna] <i>No, I'll show you,
it's super easy.</i>

00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,625
Oh, good. Good. Okay. Thank you. Bye.

273
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,927
-[Chyna] <i>Y'all are so fun.</i>
-All right.

274
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,295
I'll call you later.

275
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,565
[Khloé] It is really nice
that my sisters and I

relationship with Chyna.

that everyone is just

And we're all going to this horse race

because Mom met my dad
at the Del Mar racetrack,

290

to the horse races and stuff.

294

I just don't feel comfortable
wearing the same shirt,

00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,416
-and shorts, and sandals…
-[Khloé] If you wear sweats…

296
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,450
-[Rob] …and a hat.
-[Khloé] …I'll wear sweats.

'Cause of my weight,
I'm just not comfortable, like…

301
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,291
[Khloé] So you're not coming to San Diego?

[Rob] I… I mean, I might.

303

Might not.

304
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,966
[Khloé] Obviously,
I know clothes is a big deal

305
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,334
and you want to feel comfortable,

306
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,037
but I also want Rob to come
and kind of push himself

307
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,372
to make these memories.

308
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,941
My grandmother is, you know, turning 82,

309

and God forbid anything were to happen,

310
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,979
I think he would be really upset
with himself about that.

311
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,182
[Khloé] Rob, you said you were gonna come.

312

so many memories of being royal,

I need a plane already.

definitely reminds me of my roots.

I mean my lordship,

00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,101
[Chris] Imagine trolling around Calabasas?

333
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,903
This has got to be quicker than a Bugatti.

334
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,507
You know, if I'm gonna get
my Lord back on, I think

335
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,609
I definitely need to bring
Lord Airways into the mix.

336
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,677
[Chris] Does this come in a two-seater?

337
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,646
-It might get lonely in there.
-[Scott] Get a picture of me.

338
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,515
This is not bad.

339
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,151
[Scott] I don't think there's anything
more royal you could do

340
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,286
than probably owning
your own private aircraft.

341
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,455
Only 40 million bucks.

342
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:11,824
That's not that bad.

343
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,692
Forty million pounds for a one-seater?

344
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,028
[Scott] Two seater's probably
60 million, no big deal.

345
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,663
It's cab fare.

346
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,731
I've narrowed it down

347
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,666
to at least I know which brand I want.

348
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,235
-And it's definitely Gulfstream.
-[Chris] Definitely Gulfstream.

349
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:26,071
A lord wouldn't fly in anything
less than a Gulfstream.

350
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,073
And it's true. It makes sense.

351
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,242
-Lordstream.
-[Chris laughs]

352
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,143
Lordstream.

353
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,845
What are you gonna put
on the side of the plane?

354
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:33,946
Lord.

355
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,483
{\an8}[upbeat music]

356
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,990
{\an8}[Khloé] Are we gonna go swimming today?

357
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,792
{\an8}-[kids] Yeah!
-[Khloé] Yeah.

358
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,495
-One…
-Hi.

359
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,564
…two, three.

360
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,701
-Yay! Kick, kick, kick…
-What are you doing, Northie?

361
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,970
Ready, set, dive.

362
00:13:58,938 --> 00:13:59,939
-[laughter]
-[applause]

363
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,374
-[North speaks indistinctly]
-[all cheering]

364
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,443
[Khloé] How cute is her dive?

365
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,414
So, Rob says he's not coming to San Diego?

366
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,650
No, well, he said,
you know, he's just insecure,

367
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,485
he has no new clothes,

368
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,322
and he just doesn't feel, like,
appropriate going like that.

369
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,790
That's weird.

370
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,225
Who knows, he might come.

371
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,961
-[Khloé] But you know.
-Yeah.

372
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,029
Call him and talk him into it.
Where are you going, Ryan?

373
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,431
[Kim] All right, I'll call him.

374
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,202
I understand that Rob
is not comfortable in his own skin

375
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,770
and he doesn't have anything to wear,

376
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,773
but, like, it's not a reason
to miss my grandma's birthday.

377
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,476
We can pull clothes for him.
We can have stuff made.

378
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,678
Like, as long as he's open to the idea,

379
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,480
we can definitely find him
something to wear.

380
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,649
{\an8}-[line rings]
-[Rob] <i>Yo.</i>

381
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,684
{\an8}Hey, what are you doing?

382
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,086
[Rob] <i>We're driving to take some pictures.</i>

383
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,487
-<i>We're going to Reseda.</i>
-[Kim] Oh, that's cute.

384
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,724
What I wanted to see
if you didn't want to come to San Diego

385
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,360
'cause you were, like, insecure
and couldn't find anything to wear,

386
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,296
we can, like, find a stylist
to get you, like, stuff.

387
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,931
[Rob]<i> I mean,</i>

388
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,701
<i>I'm just sick and tired of wearing, like,
Gucci sandals, and a black T-shirt</i>

389
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,772
<i>and a Dodger hat. You know what I mean?
Especially to the horse race stuff.</i>

390
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,109
[Kim] Yeah, but we never know
how many birthdays she's gonna have left,

391
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,911
and I just don't want you to use, like,

392
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,779
"Oh, I have nothing to wear" as an excuse

393
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,814
-for, like, another year.
-[Rob] <i>Yeah.</i>

394
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,817
[Kim] I think you have to, like,
just for even your own soul,

395
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,820
like, you have to just start
getting up and getting dressed

396
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,455
and, like, getting motivated.

397
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,757
[Rob] <i>I know.</i>

398
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,260
<i>I mean, if we can find something,
yeah, obviously I'm happy to try stuff.</i>

399
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,995
All right, let me see what I can do

400
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,196
and, like, what I could find,

401
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,965
-and we'll go from there.
-[Rob] <i>All right.</i>

402
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,668
Okay, I'm gonna take a five-minute nap.

403
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,273

[camera shutters clicking]

405
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,584
{\an8}-Hi.
-[man] Welcome to Kimble Studio.

406
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,953
{\an8}-Hi. How are you?
-[man] How you doing?

407
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,120
[Khadijah] Good. How are you?

408
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,990
-[Kim] Ooh, look at those braids.
-It's like teal at the bottom.

409
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,425
-Hi!
-[Kim] How are you?

410
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,492
[Kimble] Good.

411
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,329
Kim Kimble is a celebrity hairstylist

412
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:07,032
{\an8}who teaches how to do
different hair techniques.

413
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,835
So it's, like, so exciting
that we're gonna meet with her

414
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,037
and she's gonna teach us how to braid

415
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,206
and how to just take care of curly hair.

416
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,307
I'm, like, struggling.

417
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,143
North's hair is, like, ringlets,
like, curly, curly, curly,

418
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,079
so I definitely want her to, like,

419
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,715
feel proud of her hair and wear it…

420
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,350
Like, anytime she sees
someone with curly hair,

421
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,751
she, like, runs up to them and was like,

422
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,619
"You have curly hair like me."

423
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,288
-Aw.
-And I just want to, like,

424
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,223
figure out how to do her hair.

425
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,992
I mean, Khadijah and I
talk about it all the time.

426
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,461
I literally can't do my child's hair.

427
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,363
-[Kim laughs]
-It's kinda bad, it's kinda bad.

428
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,398
I can absolutely help you,
I can show you how to work

429
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,733
-with curly hair…
-Okay.

430
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,434
…and if you want me to,
I can give you some little

431
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,502
-braid techniques.
-'Kay.

432
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,071
You can do some just little cute…
that's really cute now.

433
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,273
So, with the braid,
you take three separate pieces…

434
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,609
-[Kim] Uh-huh.
-[Kimble] …and you just take your finger

435
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,380
underneath the top piece…
and then you go under.

436
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,648
You got to braid it so it's onto the hair.

437
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,817
I know. I just don't know how to do that.

438
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,387
[Kimble] See, I'm working
all three, and as I'm going,

439
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,822
I'm grabbing pieces of hair

440
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,591
and connecting it with that piece here.

441
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:06,658
-[Kim] Yeah.
-[Kimble] So, I would start

442
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,862
-with this one going under.
-Under. This one?

443
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,131
And then now this goes in this hand
and that goes in that hand.

444
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,999
Now that part going under.

445
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,568
-Under the middle.
-[Kim] Okay, okay.

446
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,237
And that goes under, and then, like…

447
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,139
[Kimble] Uh-oh, you're back going in,
you're going in now.

448
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,807
-It's the other way.
-Okay. So…

449
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,043
-[Kimble giggles]
-[Kim] This is bad.

450
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,544
[Khadijah laughs]

451
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,581
It's definitely overwhelming figuring out
how to do these braids.

452
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,816
I ruined this whole girl.

453
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,651
[Kim] I honestly thought

454
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,720
it would be so much easier to learn,

455
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,791
but I feel like, with practice,
I know I can totally do it.

456
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,492
You know what? I can give you
one of these to take home

457
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,960
-if you want to practice.
-[Kim] Really?

458
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,395
And then at the next session, I can just…

459
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,631
-Oh, my gosh, North… yes.
-[Kimble] Check it out for you.

460
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,800
-[Kim] Thank you so much.
-No problem.

461
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,935
-Any time.
-Like, this is super helpful.

462
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,771
[upbeat music]

463
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,114
{\an8}-Hi. Oh, that's a cool outfit.
-[Kim] Hi.

464
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,082
Thanks.

465
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,717
I like that, and it makes you
look skinny and [bleeps].

466
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:06,852
Yeah.

467
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,587
What's on the bottom of your shoes?

468
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:09,755
[Scott] What is it?

469
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,190
[Kim] Five hundred dots.

470
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,759
[Scott] You just counted that?
What are you [bleeps] Rain Man?

471
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,994
-No. I didn't count your dots.
-[Scott] Who are you?

472
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,396
[Kim] Those look like the little
velvet stickers.

473
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,065
-[Scott] A weird chick.
-You know, that you put under something.

474
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,167
[Scott] I actually put
500 velvet dots on there.

475
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,269
How was, um…

476
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,672
-the aviation show?
-Oh. Insane.

477
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,140
-It was?
-[Scott] One of the sickest trips

478
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,374
-I've ever been on.
-Really?

479
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,009
Literally, every company

480
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,278
that makes airplanes,
whether they're private jets,

481
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,648
business jets, fighter jets,
all come to this show,

482
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,418
and I just looked at, like,
everything, just 'cause,

483
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,220
you know, it's not easy
when you're shopping for a jet,

484
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,088
it's not like just going
to a car dealership

485
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,858
so it's the only time you can,
kind of, compare

486
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,059
plane by plane…

487
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,027
Wait. You're looking for a plane?

488
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,196
-[Scott] Yeah.
-Why?

489
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,531
[Scott] I'm over cars.
I've been there and done it.

490
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,665
I've had everything.

491
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,001
Now the next step is airplanes,
you know what I mean?

492
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,238
It's been fun trying to figure out
what kind of aircraft I want,

493
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,873
what kind of configuration I want.

494
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,175
And I'd obviously put "Lord" on the side,

495
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,410
nothing pretentious, you know what I mean?

496
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,413
[Kim] I'm kind of getting worried
that Scott's missing the point.

497
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,450
We didn't mean to fly to London
and go buy a jet.

498
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,952
We all just miss the Scott that was just

499
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,489
so wild and fun, you know?
Not, like, extreme.

500
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,658
[Scott] I mean, I'm thinking
about chartering a plane

501
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,626
to get to San Diego.

502
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,295
Mm. Well, I think
that's a bit extravagant.

503
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:28,267
It's definitely a bit extravagant,
but Daddy needs a plane.

504
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,339
{\an8}[upbeat music]

505
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,047
{\an8}[Khloé] You have a ducky in your pool.

506
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,349
-You got to see it.
-[Rob] Oh.

507
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,585
Let me get my Snapchat.

508
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,587
[Khloé] Hello, my little friend.

509
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,557
-[Rob] It's a duck in the pool.
-[Khloé] The little guy.

510
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,559
-With the big one.
-[Rob] With the big duck.

511
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,194
Oh, he's cleaning himself.

512
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,863
[Khloé] Quacker. Hi.

513
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,231
Do you remember me?

514
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,266
-No!
-[Rob] No! Khloé!

515
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,202
I wanted him to feel comfortable.

516
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,237
-It's really hot out here.
-It's really hot.

517
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,172
[Rob] I'm wearing a hat and I'm hot.

518
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,908
So, Kim sent all these people to…

519
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,743
for me to try these clothes on.

520
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,446
Nothing's gonna fit me, though,
so, we'll be good.

521
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,615
It'll be real quick.

522
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,386
[Khloé] I totally get why Rob
doesn't have the best attitude

523
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,487
when it comes to this.

524
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,656
He's uncomfortable in his own body.

525
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,326
Trying on clothes is really
the last thing he wants to do.

526
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,127
But I'm gonna stay positive,

527
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,964
and I hope that he finds something
he feels great in

528
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,533
and he's gonna want to come to San Diego?

529
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,637
We got a ton of, like,
super dope stuff for you to try on.

530
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,805
Yeah.

531
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,106
[Khloé] So, what are you
comfortable wearing?

532
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,674
'Cause all you do is wear black right now.

533
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,143
Are you come… like, do you just
want to stick with black?

534
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,112
I don't even know.

535
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,581
Do you want to try on a pair of jeans?

536
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,784
[Rob] I mean, honestly,
I'm just more comfortable

537
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:56,421
with the baseball hat
and sweat shorts and sandals.

538
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,423
But you can't just wear,
like, a black T-shirt

539
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,659
and basketball shorts every day.

540
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,095
[Rob] No. I get it…

541
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,565
[Khloé] I'm a little confused
by how Rob is acting.

542
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,334
You know, his complaint is that
he has no clothes to wear to San Diego,

543
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,404
but now that he has options
of clothes to wear,

544
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,773
he's not even willing to try on anything.

545
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,876
I mean, I, like,
wasn't even comfortable, like…

546
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,845
over a hundred pounds ago, so…

547
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,546
If you just tell me, like, a genre…

548
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,614
Like, if you don't want to be in, like

549
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,882
a suit for this, that's fine.

550
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,118
I'm just not comfortable, like…

551
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,086
I don't know.

552
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,225
[light music]

553
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,332
{\an8}[Khadijah] See, if only
I could take Celine's head…

554
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,067
{\an8}-[Malika] Khadijah, what?
-[Khadijah] Stick it in between

555
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,836
{\an8}my legs like this,
then I would be able to do this.

556
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:48,340
{\an8}Oh, for, like, a split second,
I thought that was, like, a kid.

557
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,708
[Khadijah] I just said if I could get…

558
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,210
Do you know my nanny was holding that?

559
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,780
-Really?
-[Kim] And the housekeeper walked in

560
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,281
and was, like, in the back, going,

561
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,283
-"Northie, you're still here?"
-[laughter]

562
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,752
And then she was like, "Wait, no, it's a…"

563
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,888
You're like, uh, "That is the furthest

564
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,423
from what my daughter looks like.

565
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,557
-Thanks."
-I know.

566
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,225
[Malika] Wouldn't it be nice
if you could give North

567
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:10,929
-two, like, French braids?
-That's, like, my dream.

568
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,098
I wanted… I want you to try and braid.

569
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,501
Okay. So, let me show you
how I would do it.

570
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,004
Now, lay that one down.

571
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,373
And grab.

572
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,442
[tense music]

573
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,146
Kimberly, this is becoming a braid
not attached to her head.

574
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,915
I know, I forgot this side.

575
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,685
[Kim] I just don't get why this
is, like, still so difficult.

576
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,420
I've been practicing a lot,

577
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,290
and my braiding skills are a disaster.

578
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,526
I just really hope that
I can figure this out.

579
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,462
[Malika] In a way, does it bother you?

580
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,698
Do you feel like, I don't know
how to do my daughter's hair?

581
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,300
-[Kim] Yeah.
-[Khadijah] It's kind of embarrassing.

582
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,135
You know, I don't think
you need to be embarrassed,

583
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,738
but I think you guys would feel
so much better if you were like,

584
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,874
-"I can do my daughter's hair."
-Yeah.

585
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,243
[upbeat music]

586
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,250
{\an8}-[Kim] Who is that?
-[Scott] Scott.

587
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,419
-[Kim] Hi. What are you doing?
-Just roaming around.

588
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,688
You're just bored, in the area?

589
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,323
You can play with Saint.

590
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,492
He's literally the best.

591
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,061
But he said "Dada"
the other day, and I was like,

592
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,430
"How dare you not say 'Mama' first?"

593
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,564
-And I was like…
-[exhales]

594
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,366
Starting off young with problems.

595
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,901
Wait, what's going on with my brother?

596
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,504
He just deleted
all of the pictures of Chyna…

597
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,172
-[Scott] Oh, no.
-And everywhere in the media,

598
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,175
-it says they're broken up.
-Oh, [bleeps].

599
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,676
[Kim] Let's call Rob.

600
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,881
[line ringing]

601
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,816
[automated voice] <i>I'm sorry,
the person you are trying to…</i>

602
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:38,917
Something's going on.

603
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,385
He's not answering my calls,
and I texted him…

604
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,020
[Scott] I just wrote him, too.
I'm supposed to look at houses

605
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,321
today at four o'clock with him.

606
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,590
Does this mean he's not gonna come
to San Diego, probably?

607
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:46,691
[Kim] Totally.

608
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,494
I mean, I can call Chyna.

609
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,962
[Scott] I think we go for it.

610
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,131
[line ringing]

611
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,000
{\an8}-[Chyna] <i>Hello.</i>
-Hi.

612
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,502
{\an8}-[Chyna] <i>Hey.</i>
-What are you doing?

613
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,939
{\an8}[Chyna] <i>Um, about to start
getting my makeup done.</i>

614
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:01,873
<i>What are you doing?</i>

615
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,309
[Kim] I just, um,
am sitting here with Scott,

616
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,244
but I've been trying
to get a hold of my brother,

617
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,113
and he is totally MIA.

618
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,649
Oh, and then he deleted
all of his Instagrams.

619
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,017
-Like a lunatic.
-[Chyna] <i>Yeah.</i>

620
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,519
<i>He does stuff for, like, a reaction.</i>

621
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,654
-Cry for help.
-[Chyna] <i>Like, for example,</i>

622
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,322
<i>he asked me about his business stuff,</i>

623
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,524
<i>and then I gave him my honest opinion,</i>

624
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,259
<i>and then he got upset with me.</i>

625
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,429
<i>Like, I'm just trying to be stress-free,
'cause Rob doesn't realize,</i>

626
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,964
<i>like, when he's not in a good mood,</i>

627
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,567
<i>it affects everybody.
And I just don't want,</i>

628
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,435
-<i>like this stuff to transpire…</i>
-Yeah.

629
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,205
-[Chyna] <i>…to the baby, you know?</i>
-[Kim] Yeah, totally.

630
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,774
[Chyna] <i>Honestly,
I think he doesn't want to go</i>

631
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,877
<i>to MJ's birthday party on Tuesday.</i>

632
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:40,879
-Stop.
-[Chyna] <i>And I feel like</i>

633
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,347
-<i>that's what this is all about.</i>
-[Kim] Totally.

634
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,149
[Chyna] <i>"'Cause if I start
an argument with Chyna,</i>

635
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,251
<i>and I really don't want to go…" </i>

636
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,787
-Totally.
-[Chyna] <i>"…even more reason for me</i>

637
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:51,990
<i>not to go to MJ's party
and I can blame it on Chyna maybe."</i>

638
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,026
-I just don't even know what to say.
-[Chyna] <i>Yeah.</i>

639
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:59,397
I know that Rob and Chyna have, like,
an unstable relationship.

640
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,100
There's obviously,
two sides to every story.

641
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,969
And, you know, they just know

642
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,537
how to push each other's buttons,

643
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,539
and my brother just, like, shuts down,

644
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,441
and doesn't really tell us because

645
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,310
he doesn't want us to turn
against him or against her.

646
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,914
So instead he just comes up
with all of these excuses.

647
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,318
[upbeat music]

648
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,426
[Scott] Thanks, guys,
for flying the friendly skies.

649
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,330
[Scott] Quite frankly,
with all this Lord talk,

650
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,500
I really didn't feel comfortable
driving all the way down

651
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,536
to San Diego,
especially with summer traffic.

652
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,738
All right, boys and girls,
let's get going.

653
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,773
[Scott] If I had to say
what would a lord do,

654
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,242
I know what he would do.
He'd charter an aircraft.

655
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,312
[Kourtney] All right, guys.
We're gonna rock and roll.

-Have you, um, talked to Rob?

661
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:07,966
No.

662
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,502
No. I texted him my new number
and, like, he didn't respond.

663
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,937
No, I've been texting him and calling him

664
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,105
-and he won't answer.
-[phone ringing]

665

-[Kim] Hey.
-[Kourtney] <i>Hi.</i>

666
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,442
Are you guys on your way?

667
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,344
[Kourtney] <i>Yeah, we're here.</i>

668
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,180
<i>We landed
and we're just driving to the hotel.</i>

669
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,315
You landed?

670
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,817
[Kourtney] <i>Yeah,
we took the airplane and now we're here.</i>

671
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,018
-What?
-What?

672
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,787
That's crazy.

673
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,722
Okay, we'll see you soon.

674
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,692
I know I really wanted the Lord back,

675
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,460
but I feel like we're now
creating a monster.

676
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,295
I don't think, like…

677
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,264
Scott's really understanding,

678
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,167
like, what we mean when we,
like, bring the Lord back.

679
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,702
I don't want Scott to spend money.

680
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,071
I don't want Scott to be a douchebag again

681
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,138
and be obnoxious.

682
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,608
All I want is, like, a little personality.

683
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,775
That's all.

684
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,177
-Uh-oh. I can't control it.
-Oh!

685
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,112
-You just threw your Shopkins…
-I can't control it!

[Kim] We're all in San Diego
at the La Valencia.

693
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,101
We used to stay here when we were kids.

694
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,869
I love spending time with my grandma

695
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,739
and the whole family,
but I wish my brother was here.

696

-[Kim] What's up?
-Let's get this show on the road.

Hey. I know. You look great.

698
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,747
So, just so you guys know,
um, Chyna is gonna…

699
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,948
[Scott] You guys
are drinking tequila in here?

700
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,317
…meet us, yeah… at the restaurant.

701
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,386
So she's coming without him?

702
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,423
Yeah. Well, you know what?
Here's the thing.

703
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,092
She really wanted to come
and show her support for MJ

704
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,495
and say "happy birthday"
and be with all of us.

705
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,664
It's nice that she's…
it's nice that she's…

706
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,898
making an effort.

707
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,100
[Kim] I mean, I just think
that Rob just, like, honestly

708
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,303
has to just start being honest.
Like, enough with the excuses.

709
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,471
Like, we're never gonna believe him.

710
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,141
If you don't want to come,
just say, "I don't want to come."

711
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,076
That's what pisses me off
so bad about him.

712
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,412
She's trying to make an effort
for the both of them,

713
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,814
because I think she's
just throwing… you know,

714
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,116
a towel in the air, going,
"I don't even know what to do."

715
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,152
You think she just threw a towel
in the air?

716
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,420
Well, whatever it is.

Oh, my gosh.

00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,269
And the balloons…

-Hi, MJ.

[Khloé] It's my MJ's birthday.
You look beautiful.

726
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,346
MJ, look how hot you look.

727
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:36,614
I know. I know.

728
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,516
-No, really. It's wild.
-I'm just kidding.

729
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,052
[MJ] So are you looking forward
to the races, girls?

730
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,821
Your mother and I grew up there.
[chuckles]

731
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,457
-Yes, we did.
-[Khloé] My mom found a husband there.

732
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,559
-Yeah.
-If we're going to feed them,

733
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,060
can we move them down one?

734
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,530
-Guys, let's all move down one seat.
-[Kourtney] Why, who's here?

735
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,099
[MJ] Who's here?

736
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,701
-Chyna, but she can sit there.
-And who's she with?

737
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,769
-Herself.
-[Kris] Herself.

738
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,437
Because Rob canceled.

739
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,774
Well, that's… that's a shame.
That's a shame.

740
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:03,942
Rob should've been the one to come.

741
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,410
[Kris] Well, guess what.

742
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,779
-Look at the glass half full.
-[MJ] All right.

743
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,148
[Kris] I don't want any negative waves.

744
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,919
It really makes me sad
when Rob misses any event,

00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,522
and especially a family celebration.

746
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:22,427
But I need to be as positive as possible

It sucks that Rob flakes,

00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,022
but it's, like, so nice
that Chyna made this effort

759
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,958
to come down and spend
my grandma's birthday with us.

760
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,427
When you were texting Rob,
did it go through?

761
00:29:56,494 --> 00:30:00,198
I texted him the night before I called you
and was like, "Have you talked to him?"

762
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,100
-Mm-hm.
-[Kim] This was what I sent him.

763
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,036
And I thought he would at least respond,
because it was, like, a cute baby pic.

764
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,938
-[Chyna] No, that's super cute.
-[Kim] You know what?

765
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,608
I almost feel like he likes it
when we're all stalking him.

766
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,145
But try to text again now…

767
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,247
and see if it says "delivered." [laughs]

768
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,250
I'm like, this dude…
like, he blocked all my friends.

769

Oh, he blocked you, too.

770
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,488
Why would he block us?

00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,191
-[Kourtney] Khlo, what is that?
-Why would he block all of us?

772
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,827
-[MJ] Why?
-[Kim] Grandma, he's a little off.

773
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:32,330
[MJ] Tell… tell him, Chyna,
that Mary Jo wants to talk to him.

774
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,932

-[Khloé] He blocked us.
-[Kim] What is he doing?

776
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,070
Does Rob normally, like,
just run away like that?

That's how he's been
for the last, like, three years.

778
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,042
Like, he came to my wedding.

779

-He went to a fitting.
-Yeah.

780
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,245
And he left.

-It's just who he is.
-That's crazy.

what the answer is.

Yeah.

784
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,855

that you came

00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,057
to, um, my grandma's birthday…

786
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,593

-Chyna, she's opening your gift.

-Oh, me?
-[MJ] Oh, my gosh.

-[Chyna] You're welcome. Happy birthday.

-From me and Rob.
-[MJ] Yeah.

so Kim and I are thinking,

824
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,459
let's make this a fun thing.

825
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,629
What's higher than a lord? A duke.

826
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,898
[Khloé] Let's get Lord a duke title.

827
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,499
He can be the Lord and the Duke,

828
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,102
but at least maybe the Duke
has, like, a clean slate.

829
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,870
And he could be…

830
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,807
whatever persona he wants to be
as the Duke.

831
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:59,243
I don't think I want to be
referred to as the Dooken.

832
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,012
[laughs] As the Dookie.

833
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,680
[Scott] Right.

834
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,615
-Except she was like…
-…a Dookie.

835
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,817
[laughter]

836
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,685
Are you okay?

837
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:11,089
What about the Double Ds? The Double Ds.

838
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,524
Scott, you got some Double Ds.
[laughs]

839
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,593
How, how are you, Duke Disick?

840
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,729
Double [bleeps].
[laughs]

841
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,632
Right. What does this really mean?
Is there something more to this?

842
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,634
[Khloé] It's like us saying
we miss the Lord,

843
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,470
that doesn't mean we need you to be, like,

844
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,972
like, big ballin'
and, like, trying to buy planes.

845
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,243
We just want you to, just be fun.

846
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,979
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm definitely the type of guy

847
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:38,750
that covers some of my problems
with materialistic items.

848
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,886
And I'm pretty sure
when the family came to me

849
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,122
and said they wanted more of the Lord,

850
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,724
they really just kind of more so
wanted to get me out of, like,

851
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,259
the little funk that I was in.

852
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:52,530
Yeah, I definitely appreciate
that they notice and care.

853
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,165
I can't ask much more than that.

854
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,601
[Scott] I realize I don't have
to go that far

855
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,037
with the whole Lord thing,
and I can calm down

856
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,805
-and just be myself.
-Just a… just a dookie.

857
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,441
There's nothing wrong
with a good ol' clean dook.

858
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,443
-[Khloé] No.
-[laughter]

859
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,514
[upbeat music]

860
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,887
Oh, I can't stand looking like this.

861
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,790
I need my hair up or something.

862
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,458
There's just, like, no makeup…

863
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,594
[laughs] …in Nantucket.

864
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,396
First of all, [bleeps] Nantucket.

865
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,099
You're talking, looking like this?

866
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,867
But I'm not complaining about it.

867
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,135
Yeah.

868
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:35,873
Anyway, Kathy called me last night
looking for Rob, and so did the twins.

869
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,575
And I said, "Oh, he hasn't been around,

870
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,776
I haven't seen him."

871
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,779
We can't, like, act like
what he's doing isn't wrong.

872
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,550
If this was any man that we were with,
we would be pissed. How dare…

873
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,085
I don't even know what he's doing.

874
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,653
He hasn't spoken to her in days.

875
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,021
-[Kourtney] Why?
-How dare you leave a preg--

876
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,522
I don't give a [bleeps].

877
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,026
You still need to check on her.
Would you be happy with Kanye

878
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,428
if he disappeared for five days
and never reached out to you?

879
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,297
-[Kim] No, I'd die.
-Right.

880
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,399
I don't care if it's our brother,
facts are facts.

881
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,201
It's crazy how he's acting.

882
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,136
-[Kim] Totally.
-That's so [bleeps] up.

883
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,172
[Khloé] Rob is going to be a dad,
and he has a family

884
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,876
to answer to, so I feel like
now, more than ever,

885
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,512
Rob can't handle things
the way he once did.

886
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,913
He has to deal with his problems.

887
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,715
He can't just run away and ignore them.

888
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,221
{\an8}[upbeat music]

889
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,727
[Kim] Do you love
how Mommy did your braids?

890
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,195
-[North babbles]
-[Kim] I love your braids.

891
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,197
Do you love your braids Mama did?

892
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,134
Okay, let's go to KoKo's room
and say "Let's go, guys."

893
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,735
{\an8}[North] Let's go.

894
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,905
I couldn't make it down
for MJ's birthday dinner,

895
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,040
but I wanted to make sure
that I could make it down

896
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:45,076
for the races to at least
see her for a little bit.

897
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,079
And it's just nice to have a fun
day out like this.

898
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,347
It's kind of like dressing up,

899
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,582
and I love horses and being around them,

900
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,384
so yeah, it's cool.

901
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,395
{\an8}-[Kendall] You did?
-Yeah.

902
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:09,433
[Kim] I worked so hard
on these braids, and it's,

903
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,103
like, such a fun experience
in the morning with North and I,

904
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,639
like, just getting her ready
and getting her hair done.

905
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,874
I'm just excited for everyone to see them.

906
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,943
I went to a hair tutorial place.

907
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,612
Kim Kimble, she taught me
how to make braids.

908
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,582
I mean, I think anything
with parenting just takes time.

909
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,552
You're not gonna know
how to do everything overnight.

910
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,620
All you can really do is try your best

911
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,789
and just keep on learning
and keep on practicing,

912
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,091
and that's really all you can hope for.

913
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:37,028
-[Kendall] All right, should we go?
-Uh, let's go outside!

00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,611
[MJ] I was saying,
"That girl looks like Kendall."

-Happy birthday.
-I was surprised.

I'm so glad to see you.

00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,317
[Kendall] I'm so happy to see you.

922
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,752
Oh, my God, you look amazing.

923
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,288
Oh, my God. It's the Duke.

-[Scott] How the hell are you?
-The Duke.

925
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,459
Oh, my goodness, Dookie.

926
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,861
I haven't rocked anything
like this in a long time.

927
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:14,031
I'm throwing Duke way out of the water.

928
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,132
-[Khloé] Okay.
-[Scott] I'm not a duke.

929
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,267
I'll stay the Lord.

930
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:20,004
I want to say,
from the deepest bottom of my heart,

931
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,107
thank you for bringing the Lord back.
It feels so good.

932
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,277
[Scott] You know, I'm happy
that everybody supports the Lord.

933
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,678
Because I've always been the Lord,

934
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,615
and the Lord is here to stay.
And that's it.

935

00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,218

-Do you like it?

-Aw, man.
-[Scott] All right.

-I'm going home ahead.

to come back as the Lord today.

00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,633
[Khloé] Of course,
now that we're back in LA,

969
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,235
Rob conveniently is found
and answers his phone

970
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,604
and unblocks all of us all of a sudden.

971
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,540
It's ridiculous that he keeps doing

972
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:03,708
this disappearing act.

973
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,544
Rob, why did you disappear?

974
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,986
I just didn't want to hear from everyone
about anything regarding anything,

975
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,155
so I choose to block everybody
and that's it.

976
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,591
[Khloé] Why didn't you go to San Diego?

977
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,059
'Cause I went to Vegas instead.

978

So that's more important than
your grandmother's 82nd birthday?

979
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:29,266
No, I just didn't feel like going because,
um, me and Chyna just got in

a little, a little disagreement.
That was it.

981
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,071
So I was just like,
"I'm just gonna leave."

982
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,308
She just gave me a reason
to not want to go with her to San Diego.

983
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:41,912
I was just like, "All right, my boys
are going to Vegas. Road trip. I'm good."

984
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,114
So you really went to Vegas?

985
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,415
-He really did.
-[Rob] Yeah.

986
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,986
I just feel like you need
to communicate more and tell us,

987
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,654
like, when you're going through something

988
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,590
so we can help you.
Like, if you don't want to go

989
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:53,858
to San Diego, that's fine,
but maybe, like, tell us.

990
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,893
[Kim] Yeah, just be like,
"Everyone off my back."

991
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,695
[Rob] Obviously I get it.

992
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:00,097
Communication, sending a text message.

993
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,932
But with you guys, if I said,

994
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,701
"Oh, I'm gonna take a couple days off,"

995
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,604
then everyone would freak out,
think something's wrong.

996
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,006
"What's wrong with Rob?"
Show up in my bedroom.

997
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,376
Like, you guys are just…
it just gets very dramatic.

998
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,545
[tense music]

999
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,751
If Rob feels that we are really
dramatic and judgmental,

1000
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,888
I feel like we all have
to take heed to that.

1001
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:26,190
What's done is done,
and I'm just happy that Rob

1002
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,859
is now able to talk to us about things.

1003
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,896
I really hope though that we each
learn something from this.

1004
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:34,932
I hope Rob knows that
he doesn't have to just block

1005
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,101
every family member that exists.

1006
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,370
Okay, so how are you and Chyna now, good?

1007
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,439
-Yeah, we're all good.
-[Khloé] But you guys keep going

1008
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,941
like, I feel like you guys
have high highs and low lows.

1009
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,076
How can we, like, keep it, like, even?

1010
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,078
[Kim] You guys just can't push
each other's buttons.

1011
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,314
No, I push her buttons all the time.

1012
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,583
She pushes mine all the time. You know?

1013
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,319
[Kim] Do you think life
is better with four kids or two?

1014
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,122
[Khloé] Life is better with me.

1015
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,124
-Really?
-No kids.

1016
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:03,861
I just think, for me, four or six.

1017
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,362
-[Kim] You?
-[Khloé and Rob laughing]

1018
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,198
[Kourtney] Oh, Khloé's whole ass was out.

1019
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,166
-[chuckles]
-[Khloé] My ass was out?

1020
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,069
{\an8}-Your whole entire ass.
-I'm wearing Spanx,

1021
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,972
{\an8}-but he pulled up my shirt.
-[Kourtney] Oh.

1022
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,007
[Khloé] I have a good ass,
so you guys are fine.

1023
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,509
[Kim] <i>Coming up next week…</i>

1024
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,644
[Scott] I didn't know
water aerobics was so sexual.

1025
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,847
I just don't know if it's
the most appropriate thing

1026
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,583
spending time with women that are, like,
20 years older than me.

1027
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,420
Like, since when were you
interested in water aerobics?

1028
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,088
[Kim] Yeah, that's a little odd.

1029
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,390
[Kendall] The sleep paralysis
is, like, really getting to me.

1030
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:34,492
Nothing can move.

1031
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:39,129
You have a week in Paris,
Milan, and then London.

1032
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,032
-I can't travel that much.
-Well, you're already booked.

1033
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,834
I'm, like, scared. I'm freaking out.
