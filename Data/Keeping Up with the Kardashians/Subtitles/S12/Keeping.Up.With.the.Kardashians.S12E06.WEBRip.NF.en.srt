Hello, Mr. Montana.

{\an8}-You remember French.
-Hi.

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,989
{\an8}[Khloé] Doesn't this remind you
of the Hamptons, this house?

8
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,624
-Yeah.
-But we're not in the Hamptons

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,760
and none of us are together anymore.

-Oh, man, what'd you do, Karim?

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,331
[Scott] I brought you together once,

13
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,732
-I'm gonna bring you back.
-When did you ever bring…

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,700
Oh, no.

15
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,368
[Scott] I introduced you, guys.

16
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,770
-No.
-Nah, he walked right up to me.

17
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,605
He was like, "You trying
to [bleep] my sister, huh?"

18
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,839
[Scott laughs]
Yeah.

19
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,708

[Khloé chuckles]

21
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,511
-[Khloé] Do you like my nails?
-[French] I love 'em.

22
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,513
I like the little gold splash
you got on there.

23
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,115
[Scott] Hey, look at the way
he just touched your hand.

24
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,050
[French] Of course. All the time.

25
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,918
He didn't care about those nails.
That's a real man.

26
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,988
-[Khloé] Oh, god.
-Why is she hating on you?

27
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,756
She's always been a hater.

28
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,993
Well, this has been a lovely surprise,
seeing you here.

-[Khloé] It's been real. Okay.

-Don't touch me. Too low.
-[Scott] There you go.

-That's the way to start the day.
-That thing's still fat.

Yo, talk to Kourt.

-Let's make this all work out.
-[Khloé] All right.

-We were talking about it,

and then he was like, "Okay, well,
can you wait to decide this?"

-[Kim] But I stayed… I stayed…

to have this argument with her.

No, 'cause I would say
there's, like, a six-month period

-When are you ready to go out?

00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,280
[Mason] And I know how to spell "cat."

171
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,548
C-A-T.

172
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,883
[French whoops]

173
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,185
-How cool is he?
-Yeah, no, the best.

174
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,420
[Kylie] He's so cool.

175
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,757
[upbeat music]

176
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,130
[Kourtney] Jonathan.

177
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,065
[Jonathan] Whoa.

178
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,867
You really dressed up for me.

179
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,335
{\an8}What time is the royal ball?

180
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,871
[Kourtney] Okay. These people
were yelling "goals" at me,

181
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,639
and I could not understand
what they were saying.

182
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,408
I'm like, "Why are they screaming 'gold'?"

183
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,475
[all laugh]

184
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,711
And they were like, "Goals. Your goals."

185
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,413
And I was like, "Wait, I'm gold?"

186
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,081
[Jonathan] Yeah, they wanna be you, baby.

187
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,949
Your goals. Wait, I have to tell you,

188
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,618
Kim's really been pissing me off.

189
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,386
She's literally turned into the old you.

190
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,954
Remember? You called me, "Mommy, Mommy."

191
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:02,855
[Jonathan] All the time.

192
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,591
So then she's not only that, she's worse.

193
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,429
So Kim has turned
into, like, a mother from hell.

194
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,664
A mother stays home with her kids.

195
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,066
A mother from hell would go out with you.

196
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,668
[Jonathan] Well, she's a mother
from hell to me.

197
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,270
Did you think that she was
gonna be going out

198
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,471
every Friday, Saturday, Sunday?

199
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,605
[Jonathan] Like, I'm there,

200
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,542
and she needs to give me
some attention when I'm there.

201
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,510
-Okay.
-[Kourtney] She just had a baby.

202
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,246
-She went from one to two kids.
-[Jonathan] Kourtney, listen to me.

203
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,715
I was thinking of getting one
of those people that look like Kim.

204
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,184
[Simon] Right. Like a look-alike?

205
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,418
[Jonathan] Like a look-alike. But, like…

206
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,554
-Like a look-alike? [laughs]
-…kinda looks like her.

207
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,422
-[Kourtney] Like a look-alike?
-Like a look-alike?

208
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,624
[Jonathan] Like a look-alike.
And I'm gonna go out with her,

209
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,293
and I know that we're
gonna get photographed,

210
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,527
and she's gonna be so pissed.

211
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,862
[Simon] Should be constant Snapchats too.

212
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,565
-Oh, I'm gonna Snapchat…
-[Simon] BFFs, squad goals.

213
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,966
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-[Simon] Everything.

214
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,668
[Jonathan] I think it'd be
the funniest thing.

215
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,736
-Do you think Kim will care?
-[Jonathan] Yeah.

216
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,172
Bitch is [bleep] sitting at home
with her kids, being a mother,

217
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,874
while I'm trying to go hit the town.

218
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,210
-I'm ready to trade her in, for you.
-[laughs]

219
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,011
-Because you are, you are--
-Who wouldn't be?

220
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,881
-You are the funny one now.
-I can't blame you. "Now"?

221
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,283
Was Kim ever funny?

222
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,551
[Simon laughs]

223
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,087
[upbeat music]

224
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,261
{\an8}[Kim] I feel like I have heartburn again.

225
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,696
What is going on?

226
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,130
It's probably because you have

227
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,066
so many things going on inside your body.

228
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,567
Hormones are changing,

229
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,970
-your insides are changing.
-[Kim] Yeah.

230
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,239
You know your necklace
doesn't say "Saint."

231
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,907
Yeah. I just have to shorten one.

232
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,109
[Kris] It's so cute.

233
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,577
[Kim] I feel so bad for Khloé.

234
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,580
She's been, like, so stressed out
and so overwhelmed.

235
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,015
Yeah, I know.

236
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,017
Because she has, like, you know, Lamar.

237
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:38,985
I know.

238
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,053
She needs to also just take a minute

239
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,056
and not be doing that all the time.

240
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,226
[Kim] <i>Khloé's in such an awkward position</i>

241
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,228
'cause they were getting a divorce before,

242
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,132
and then, they called it off
when Lamar was really sick.

243
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,735
And now that he's doing better,
they're not, like,

244
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,270
intimately together.

245
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,706
So does she still stick
with staying married to him?

246
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,608
Does she re-file for divorce?

247
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,077
Like, what is the right move
for her to make?

248
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,412
I just don't know what to do.

249
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,281
She called me this morning, just…

250
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,016
ready to hit a wall.

251
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,517
It's like she's super stressed.

252
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,953
I feel like she just needs,
like, a girls' day.

253
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,722
I know. Everybody needs
a little bit of downtime.

254
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,158
So, it's almost like,
maybe if we plan something

255
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,193
and just get away for a minute.

256
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,396
She's never gonna take
any time off by herself.

257
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,033
[Kim] <i>I feel really, really bad for Khloé.</i>

258
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,269
She doesn't wanna create
any situation that would, like,

259
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,806
cause him to be depressed
or go back into any kind of,

260
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,341
like, old bad habits,

261
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,611
<i>and just feels like it'll be her fault
if something happens.</i>

262
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,080
<i>But she's also missing out
so much on her life.</i>

263
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,116
She has, like, all these
crazy life decisions to make.

264
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,453
She's definitely
bit off more than she can chew.

265
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,357
[upbeat music]

266
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,664
{\an8}[Khloé] Do I wanna do
a Make-A-Wish thing at my house?

267
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,633
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

268
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,501
[Khloé] Sure, that's okay,

269
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,338
and we will do, like,
donuts, comma, cookies…

270
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,572
-Cupcakes.
-How old is she?

271
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,807
-[cell phone beeps]
-[Khloé] Shut up.

272
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,075
The thing was talking.

273
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,443
[Kris laughs]
Oh, I'm sorry.

274
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,444
Cupcakes…

275
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,946
See, this is what's wrong
with you in your life.

276
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,382
Every time you have
five minutes to yourself,

277
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,084
you fill it up with something else.

278
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,585
It's a Make-A-Wish person though.

279
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,587
-No, no, I know.
-What am I gonna do, not do that?

280
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,956
Of course, you're gonna do it,
but I'm just saying,

281
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,059
every once in a while,
even you need to take a break.

282
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,328
I need to take you away.

283
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,598
I think that sometimes

284
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,900
because you're there every single day

285
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,403
and doing such an amazing job with Lamar,

286
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,971
that you don't realize

287
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,073
that you, too, need a break
once in a while.

288
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,408
Oh, I do realize it.

289
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,577
-That's why I snap.
-Exactly.

290
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,512
So we are gonna go to Napa,

291
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,748
and we're gonna go wine tasting

292
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,850
and just have a fabulous time together.

293
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,184
Deal?

294
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,021
I agree with my mom
that I need to get away.

295
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,122
I just feel like,

296
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,990
<i>is now really the right time to go?</i>

297
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,559
<i>But it's a 45-minute flight
if anything happens,</i>

298
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,029
and I actually just feel
really relieved to get away

299
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,563
from all the Lamar stuff for a minute.

300
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,298
[Kris] So, I'll plan the whole thing,

301
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,034
and at the end of it,

302
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,502
I hope you'll say,

303
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,604
-"You were right, Mom."
-"That was the best trip ever."

304
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,242
You know what, I think you've had
way too much Diet Snapple.

305
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,812
Yeah. Okay, I'm making plans,
kiddo, so get ready.

306
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,714
[upbeat music]

307
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,488
{\an8}[Jonathan] Welcome to the house.

308
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,991
The location here
is one second from everywhere.

309
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,225
I could walk to Beverly Hills

310
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,326
-if I want. Yeah.
-Really?

311
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,328
-So, what's up?
-Wait, hold on.

312
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,631
So, you know,
'cause everybody wants a butt,

313
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,133
so Dr. Ourian bought this factory,

314
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,669
and he made these
that you can't see, like,

315
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,037
for girls that can't afford butts,

316
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,306
like, to lift their ass,
so I'm gonna make this--

317
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,475
-So, does it lift it and pad it?
-Yeah.

318
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,178
No, no, it pads it, but it gives
you like, uh, like, nice high ass.

319
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,245
Will you try it on?

320
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,413
[Kourtney] Give me the black one.

321
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,349
What I have now is all muscle.

322
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,751
[Jonathan] Oh, damn.

323
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,953
-[Kourtney] No, I don't know if…
-[Jonathan] You look like Naomi Campbell.

324
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,789
-Holy [bleep].
-[Kourtney] This is what I need to do.

325
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,291
-[Jonathan] Oh. It's…
-It does keep…

326
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,959
Damn, you go down low.

327
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,794
You're like a [bleep] stripper
at King of Diamonds

328
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,529
on Monday nights in Miami.

329
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,765
Now I'm really ready for a nap.

330
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,100
Well, thanks for hanging out.

331
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,401
-Yeah.
-This girl's coming

332
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,736
but I didn't wanna meet her alone.

333
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,804
-She's coming here?
-No, no, we're hanging out.

334
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,740
-You two?
-With Dr. Ourian.

335
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,308
I really wanna piss Kim off.

336
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,509
I hope she really looks like her.

337
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,910
This is so exciting.

338
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,045
Sucks that you have so many kids

339
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,347
and you can't hang out with me
all the time when I'm here.

340
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,015
It sucks that I have kids?

341
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,584
-So many.
-Oh.

342
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,719
[upbeat music]

343
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,360
{\an8}[Scott] Oh, wow, I've never seen his room.

344
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,696
-Aren't you going to Dubai?
-[Tyga] Yeah, man.

345
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,930
How long are you gonna stay in Dubai for?

346
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,132
Like, four days.

347
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,433
[Scott] Why didn't you want to go, Kylie?

348
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,968
[Tyga] She used to travel
the world with me.

349
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,369
I've been everywhere with him.

350
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,271
{\an8}[Scott] Trust me,
it only gets worse, buddy.

351
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,706
{\an8}They just keep getting meaner.

352
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,708
-[Tyga] I think she's different.
-And meaner and meaner.

353
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,276
[Tyga] Can't be no worse than you.

354
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,212
[Scott] You've never seen me
say one bad thing to anybody.

355
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,547
-What?
-[Kylie] What?

356
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,049
These two girls went up to him
and asked for a photo,

357
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,985
and he's in the photo.
Right before they take it,

358
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,488
he goes, "Psych. I'm not taking
a [bleep] photo with you,"

359
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,589
and he runs away.

360
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,458
-[doorbell rings]
-[Scott] Oh, wait.

361
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,959
The psychic guy that I called is here.

362
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,195
-[Kylie] Hello.
-[Scott] Hi.

363
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,398
{\an8}-I'm Scott. How you are?
-Brett. Nice to see you.

364
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,901
{\an8}-I'm Kylie. Nice to meet you.
-Hi, Kylie. Nice to meet you.

365
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,235
-Hi, Ty.
-Tyga.

366
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,937
-Oh, Tyga.
-But you already knew that.

367
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,772
-What's that?
-Nothing, don't worry.

368
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,375
He's funny. He's got jokes.

369
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,510
-[Brett] I'll just get started.
-Okay.

370
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,512
[Brett] I feel very drawn
to you specifically

371
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:34,847
about relationships in general.

372
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,549
Whether it's with your family

373
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,984
or whether it's with your partner,
or, like, whoever it is,

374
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,987
things are just kind of going
in a very different way

375
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,324
that's not giving you the clarity
that you're looking for.

376
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,893
I mean, I think everybody
kind of feels that way, right?

377
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,328
Uh, yeah.
[stutters]

378
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,364
It gets really kind of confusing.

379
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,467
It's almost as if
I have a lens going on in one eye,

380
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,002
then I have a lens in the other eye,

381
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,938
and I'm looking in two different lenses,

382
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,773
and it makes it very unclear.

383
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,941
Correct?

384
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,044
Um, I guess you could say that.

385
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,012
Okay.

386
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,617
I feel like everybody
that's dated any girl

387
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,186
within her family
has gotten some kind of curse.

388
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,021
That's what we're kind of more
trying to get into.

389
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,024
[Brett] That's up to you
to understand for yourself.

390
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,392
You are the person

391
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,928
who's in charge of your own ship,

392
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,831
so nothing can bump you off
except your perception

393
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,100
that somebody else
is taking the ship over.

394
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,835
Do you understand what I mean by that?

395
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,204
I get that.
Tell me something I don't know.

396
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,707
Um…
[clears throat]

397
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,809
What's the definition
of what you do, exactly?

398
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,644
A spiritual medium. So I feel and sense--

399
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,146
Yeah, I think we, like,
called the wrong number.

400
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,182
-Oh, you did?
-We wanted just a psychic.

401
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,351
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

402
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,619
Oh, that's okay.

403
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,020
[Scott] <i>I asked one of the girls
who works for me</i>

404
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,688
<i>to find a good psychic.</i>

405
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,892
Evidently, she went
the complete opposite direction

406
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,562
and found the worst guy
maybe ever for what I need.

407
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,464
That's ridiculous.
We weren't looking for that.

408
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,299
I just wanted a little guy
with a little crystal ball

409
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,834
-to come in here and be, like…
-Yeah, like…

410
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,868
What's up, baby?

411
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,638
You need to get, like,
an old lady with long hair.

412
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,640
-Yeah. I want a freaky witch.
-Yeah.

413
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,508
-Little woman. With a cape on.
-[Tyga] Get a real, like…

414
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,743
Got, like, ten cats.

415
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,278
Yeah. Cats everywhere.

416
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,946
-You know what I mean?
-[Kylie chuckles]

417
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,081
[upbeat music]

418
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:22,755
[doctor] I'll come back in a few minutes?

419
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:23,822
Okay, cool.

420
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,392
[woman] Oh, it's so cute here.

421
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,626
[Jonathan] What are you doing here?

422
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,461
[inquisitive music]

423
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,829
What are you doing here?

424
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,364
-[Kamilla] Oh, hello.
-[Jonathan] What?

425
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,800
-[Kamilla] Hi.
-No, no, this was not planned.

426
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:35,935
-[Kamilla] Really?
-I cannot--

427
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:36,835
I thought that was your…

428
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,537
I was gonna say that looks like
Kim's car, but I was like no.

429
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,605
-That's so crazy.
-Kourtney just called me

430
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,706
and said they're on their way to Ourian's.

431
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,774
I was like, "Wait, I'm…

432
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,042
I'm here with a friend."

433
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,143
[Jonathan] You brought somebody here?

434
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,377
-Stop.
-Yeah.

435
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,346
[Kim] That's so funny.

436
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,981
[Jonathan] This whole thing
is weird and funny.

437
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,282
{\an8}-It is really--
-Well, there's Kim. [laughs]

438
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,384
{\an8}-Yeah, well, hello.
-[Kim] Nice to meet you.

439
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,186
Nice to meet you, too, finally.

440
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,888
[quirky music]

441
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,292
[Jonathan] I was gonna…
I was taking her with me 'cause…

442
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,127
-He wanted to show me…
-Yeah, 'cause…

443
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,630
-Ourian's office.
-[Jonathan] Yeah, we just hit the town.

444
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,565
[Kim] <i>This is super awkward.</i>

445
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,768
The fact that Jonathan
would take it to this level

446
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,937
is so bizarre to me.

447
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,206
We were just coming in
'cause I wanted Dr. Ourian

448
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,908
to just, like, look at my eye right here,

449
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,242
see if we wanted to do a little laser.

450
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,111
So I was taking her with me

451
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,447
'cause you're too busy
to hang out with me,

452
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,016
but meanwhile, you're here
hanging out with somebody,

453
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:24,917
so now I'm pissed.

454
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,519
I just realized I nailed her.

455
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,521
And like, 'cause I'm so, I was so shocked.

456
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,656
-But I realize that…
-[Kamilla] He was like,

457
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,292
-"She doesn't chill with me."
-[Jonathan] Yeah, are you kidding me?

458
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,561
[Kim] You're so ridiculous.

459
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,396
[Jonathan laughs]

460
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,565
[Kim] <i>Jonathan's trying
to rub this in my face</i>

461
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:43,135
and make me feel
some type of way, but I don't.

462
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,937
Having two kids is a lot,

463
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,972
and, like, your priorities just change.

464
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,274
-Well, we had a great lunch.
-[Kamilla] Yeah, we did.

465
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,876
-[Jonathan] We had fun.
-[Kamilla] So much fun.

466
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,611
-Mm-hmm.
-[Kim] We have to take a pic.

467
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,879
[Kamilla] We do.

can try all he wants to go</i>

00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,352
<i>and replace me, but he can't.</i>

471
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,688
Go try, honey, go try.

472
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,523
-All right. Thanks.
-Have fun.

00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,824
-See ya later.
-See ya later.

474
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,593
So nice to meet you, too.

475
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,828
-[Kim] Bye, guys, bye.
-[Jonathan] All right. See you later.

476
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,031
We don't need Kim.
Let's go do our own stuff.

[Khloé] Oh, my god, look at her hat box.

479
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:26,779
Wait. Let me snap Mom.

480
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,380
[Khloé] Where is she going?

481
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,183
She's really, like,
from <i>Breakfast with Tiffany's</i>.

482
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,251
-[pilot] Hello.
-Hello.

-[pilot] How are you?
-Shoot.

00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,355
-Hi, Mom.
-[Khloé] Hi, Audrey.

-[Khloé] How are you?
-Audrey, how are you?

486
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,160
I'm fine, darling. How are you?

487
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,361
Wow.

488
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,495
Fancy.

489
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,798
I'm confused if you're going
to a Western or a…

490
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,666
or a New York Fashion Week.

491
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,335
I'm… it's a little bit of both.

492
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,704
What are we talking about here?

493
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,706
Let's go to freaking Napa.

[Kourtney] <i>I've never been to Napa,</i>

496

and there's nobody
that's more fun to hang out with

<i>Khloé's been so stressed out,</i>

499
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,353

drink some wine, like,
just not care about anything.

00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,298
[Kris] Why?

504
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,033
I went to the show.

505
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,968
[Kourtney] I'm so tired.

506
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,636
[Kris] Was it worth it?
Was it a good show?

507
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:25,704
[Kourtney] Yeah.

Kourt's never been here.

518
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,063
-[Dave] Hi there.
-Hi, Dave. How're you? I'm Kris.

519
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,598
{\an8}-Kris, nice to see you. Welcome.
-Nice to see you, too.

00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:53,999
{\an8}-Thank you for having us.
-Welcome.

521

{\an8}-Our pleasure.

-Khloé, nice to see you.

-Okay. Thank you.
-[Kris] This is beautiful.

[Kourtney] What is that?

526
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,343
[Dave] This is the entrance
to the sacred cave here.

527
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,612
-Oh, fancy entrance.
-[Dave] Get ready, you guys,

528
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,914

is gonna blow your mind.

-This is our wine spa.

-Here we go.

-Oh, my god.
-[Khloé] Every barrel has wine in it?

533
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,489
[Dave] Yes, it does.

534
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,458
We're gonna try some
of this beautiful wine

535

out of the barrel.

536
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,162
And this is a Cabernet Sauvignon,

537
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,697
and this is a special
French barrel called Picard.

538
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,332
-Oh, I like this.
-[laughs]

539
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,800
[Dave] I have a barrel and it's so good,

540
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,502
it tastes like smoked ham.

541
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,838
[Khloé laughing]

542
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,506
[Dave] This is another Cabernet.

[Kourtney] <i>Being hungover and wine-tasting</i>

544
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,111

545
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,348
but Khloé and I, we just, like,
are entertaining ourselves,

00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,883

547
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,985
[Khloé] Oh, you wanna play the game?

00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,887
No. I'm just giving you five.

just could go on and on,

It says that everything
that you try to do,

673
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,296
you have a tendency to have,

674
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,598
um, many obstacles in front of you.

675
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,400
[tense music]

676
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,068
So, to answer your question,

677
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,604
I would probably say you do have a curse.

678
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,607
[uneasy music]

679
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,342
-Hmm. Okay.
-[psychic] Okay?

680
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,444
[Scott] <i>You know, right off the bat,</i>

681
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,746
<i>she confirms that there is a curse,</i>

682
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,949
so I think she's pretty good.

683
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,884
[psychic] So to take care of that,

684
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,154
your reading is talking about
working with Ogun

685
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,691
which it's an offering
that you do with a rooster.

686
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,326
So, like, a real…

687
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,627
A real rooster.

688
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:56,795
Kosher or not?

689
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,196
[quirky music]

690
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,798
It could be kosher, if you like.

691
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,233
Make sure he's alive.

692
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,201
Okay.

693
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,971
[Scott] <i>Everything seemed
pretty normal with this psychic,</i>

694
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,106
<i>but I need to get a rooster?</i>

695
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,108
I guess I'll try anything.

696
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,610
[psychic] When you do
that kind of offering,

697
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,111
you have to be dressed in white.

698
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,513
Then we kill the rooster or no?

699
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,814
No, we set him free.

700
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:16,882
That's not so bad.

701
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,751
You know, the rooster
carries what you have.

702
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,486
It sets you free

703
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,855
as you set him free and off he goes.

704
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,257
All right, I hope it works.

705
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,892
If it does, I'll be a very happy man.

706
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,694
Even though I'm not sure
that this curse is real,

707
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,496
[Kendall] <i>I just really hope he goes
through with the ritual</i>

708
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,064
'cause all that I'm picturing is Scott

709
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,133
holding a little rooster
in a little white gown.

710
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,669
And then, uh, that's followed
with an herbal bath

711
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,405
that you do to kind of clear
that energy so you--

712
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,506
I got to shower now?

713
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,542
Yeah, you have to shower.
[laughs]

714
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,844
[upbeat music]

715
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,345
[Kendall] Wow-wow.

716
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,148
[upbeat music]

717
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,719
{\an8}[Khloé] This is the best video.

718
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:58,056
[Kris on video] <i>A wa… A wa…
A walkie-talkie?</i>

719
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,724
[all laughing]

720
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,226
[Kourtney] This is cute.

721
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,528
-How are you?
-Good, how are you?

722
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,763
[Kris] Hi.

723
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:07,866
-[Angela] Hi, welcome.
-[Kourtney] Thanks.

724
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,100
-Hi.
-[Khloé] Hi.

725
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,369
Thank you. Hi, Khloé.

726
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,404
{\an8}-Hi.
-Nice to see you.

727
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,105
{\an8}-[Kourtney] How are you?
-[Kim] Hi.

728
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,675
{\an8}-Hi. I'm Angela with "Promise Wine."
-[Kim] Hi. Nice to meet you.

729
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,543
-It's beautiful in here. Yeah.
-Thank you. Thank you.

730
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,912
Oscar and I are gonna come by
with some wines.

731
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:21,846
[Angela] You're gonna have a lot,

732
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,682
so look at the sea of glasses, right?

733
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,783
[Kris] Oh, my goodness.

734
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,284
[Khloé] Kourtney, are you excited?

735
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,420
-[Kourtney] No.
-[Kim] Kourtney's a little hungover…

736
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,288
-[Kourtney] I am.
-…just to let you guys know.

737
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,357
[Angela] You want to know what?
They call this the hair of dog.

738
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,125
[Khloé] It looks like
she's having a tough time.

739
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,027
-[Oscar] We do have a bucket.
-I am. Yeah.

740
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,629
[Kourtney] I'm gonna need a bucket later.

741
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,798
-[chef] Hello. How are you?
-This looks beautiful.

742
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,100
-Thank you.
-[chef] This is a garden green salad

743
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,736
from our garden with roasted beets.

744
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:45,937
Looks really good.

745
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,506
-You okay, Kourt?
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.

746
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,442
I'm, like, ready to go to bed.

747
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,410
Count me in, Seymour.

748
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,512
Remember when Kourtney lived
next door to Seymour Butts?

749
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,615
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.
-[laughs]

750
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,817
[Khloé] They used to film pornos
in his backyard.

751
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,852
Then I told everyone
that he taught me how to squirt.

752
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,053
[Kris] Well, what's squirting?

753
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,622
Why don't you ask Corey to show you?

754
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,824
[laughing]

755
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,692
[Angela] How are the wines?

756
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,660
-[cell phone rings]
-[Kourtney] Good. Really good.

757
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,362
[Angela] I see that you're pacing
yourself throughout now.

758
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,529
-But that's very good.
-[Khloé] That's good.

759
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:12,764
-[Khloé] Hello?
-[Lamar] <i>Hey.</i>

760
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,065
{\an8}[Kourtney] Miss you.

761
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,300
{\an8}[Lamar] <i>Miss you, too, Kourt.</i>

762
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,635
{\an8}[Kourtney] How are you doing?

763
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,169
[Lamar] <i>I'm doing fine.</i>

764
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,071
-Hi.
-[Lamar] <i>Hey, Kris.</i>

765
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,340
-[Kris] We're going to dinner.
-[Lamar] <i>Are we?</i>

766
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,842
We could go… He would like Craig's.

767
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,243
[quirky music]

768
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,580
What about Nice Guy, Kourtney's favorite?

769
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,182
-My mom is just crazy right now.
-[Kris] I have an Italian place

770
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,485
that nobody knows about
that's a mile away from the house.

771
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,921
[Khloé] <i>The thing about my mom
is that she has great intentions</i>

772
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,758
and I know she just wants
to take Lamar out somewhere,

773
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,427
but Lamar has to focus
on trying to be sober.

774
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,497
<i>I need Lamar to make these changes
to better himself.</i>

775
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,900
I mean, a lot of [bleep] has happened
that I can't forget.

776
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,569
No virgin Roman Punches, okay?

777
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:52,671
[Lamar] <i>Why not?</i>

778
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,606
[Khloé]
'Cause I don't think you stop there.

779
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,307
I don't wanna take that risk.

780
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,076
It's that hard for you?

781
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,010
[Lamar] <i>Nah.</i>

782
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,080
-Okay, Virgin Rum, peace.
-[Lamar] <i>Bye-bye, Khloé.</i>

783
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,549
[Khloé] Ugh. This guy.

784
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,686
See, why would you say
to take him to Craig's?

785
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,888
[tense music]

786
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,257
I wanna hang out with him privately

787
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,858
just 'cause I'm allowed
to be friends with him,

788
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,060
but why do I want that in the atmosphere

789
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,294
-and all this pressure?
-[Kris] Yeah, I got it.

790
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,862
So there's this little place
right by our house--

791
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,098
-[Khloé] But if you get it, get it.
-Okay.

792
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,867
[tense music]

793
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,472
[upbeat music]

794
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,444
{\an8}Who knew you could go get roosters?

795
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,679
I usually don't go rooster shopping,

796
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,881
<i>but I figured
I'd bring my friend Benny and…</i>

797
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,750
I guess it's a pretty hot item right now.

798
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:39,751
[Scott] Hey, how are you?

799
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,986
{\an8}-Micah. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, guys. Marco.

800
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,022
{\an8}-Marco, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too, guys.

801
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,590
{\an8}[Scott] So, I'm looking for a rooster.

802
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,025
[Dylan] Well, here they are.

803
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,560
Beautiful Rhode Island Red Roosters.

804
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,895
-[Scott] Are they nasty?
-You know, they're roosters.

805
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,030
They're not gonna be
the super friendliest,

806
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,065
but they're not gonna,
bite you or anything.

807
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,400
You go first.

808
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,601
[roosters clucking]

809
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:57,669
Whoa.

810
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,437
[Marco] If you want, you can
grab it with your own hands.

811
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,673
-Uh… what's protocol?
-Yeah.

812
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,975
I'm not gonna lie, I really don't know

813
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,710
a ton about roosters.

814
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,279
[Dylan] Place your hands the same way
that I'm kinda doing it.

815
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,482
-You wanna squeeze a little bit harder.
-[Marco] Squeeze a little bit harder.

816
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:11,883
[Dylan] But not too hard. But just…

817
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,685
[Scott] He's got a good girth on him.

818
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,953
[clucks]

819
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,055
-For sure this is the one.
-That's the one.

820
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,356
[Scott] This one's gonna save my life.

821
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,191
-He's been very tame.
-Yeah.

822
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,160
Is that a boy or a girl? Whoa. Hey.

823
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,294
[all laugh]

824
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,163
[Marco] Both are boys. Every one is boy.

825
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,698
They have a return policy?

826
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,566
[Dylan] Um… not really.

827
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,034
-[Benny laughs]
-[Scott] I don't blame you.

828
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,402
Let's cage this thing up and take him.

829
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,937
-[Dylan] Perfect.
-[Marco] There you go.

830
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,240
-You have your rooster.
-Thank you.

831
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:38,076
Now I have the rooster, but it's not over.

832
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,577
[Scott] <i>I have to carry the rooster,</i>

833
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,247
I have to put my energy into him or her.

834
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,816
<i>This whole rooster thing better work.</i>

835
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,951
<i>I'm sure people think
it's a little bit weird,</i>

836
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,254
but look at this family.

837
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,556
All right, you be good now.

838
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,658
-[Benny] You hear?

839
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:54,859
[Benny] All right, all right, all right.

840
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,427
[Scott] All right.
No one's getting mad at you.

841
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,962
[Benny] Calm down, you're in a Mercedes.

842

-Relax.

844
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,074
[Kris] There's Cakebread Cellars.

845
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,509
You have to take a picture of me

846
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,311
-in front of the Cakebread Cellars sign.
-Okay.

847
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,980
[Kourtney] So cute.

848
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,650
-[Kris] Hi.
-How we doing today?

849
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,952
-[Kris] Good, how are you?
-Great, thank you. Welcome in.

850
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,687
[Kris] This is so amazing.

851
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,223
[Kourtney] I think we should take
a picture with the wineries.

852
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,758
[Khloé] I don't wanna take
one more picture.

853
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,827
You're not into snapping today?

854
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:29,928
[Khloé] No.

855
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,564
[Kourtney] Well, I'm gonna snap
you're in a bad mood.

856
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,166
We have to fly back to LA soon,

857
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,369
but we're hitting one last winery
on our way to the airport,

858
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,840
but I can just really tell
something's bothering Khloé.

859
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:45,510
She's definitely not in
as great of a mood today

860
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,644
as she was yesterday.

861
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:47,712
[man] I have a little area where…

862
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,780
-[Kris] Great.
-…it's private.

863
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,716
-[Kris] Awesome. Super.
-[man] Sit up there, taste some wine.

864
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:52,984
[Kris] It's very peaceful here.

865
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,719
Look at the clouds, you guys.

866
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,354
Just so beautiful.

867
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,891
[man] So you ladies feel free
to grab a seat.

868
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,961
We should have some cheese in the center,
which I'll kind of go over here in a bit.

869
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,531
[cell phone ringing]

870
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,433
Hello?

871
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,568
{\an8}Hey, Lam.

872
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,104
How are you?

873
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,205
[Lamar] <i>I'm all right.</i>

874
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,273
[Khloé] Did you ice your knee?

875
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,608
[Lamar] <i>Yeah.</i>

876
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,576
[Khloé] Um, did you eat today?

877
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,311
[Lamar] <i>I'm about to eat right now,
Pop Tarts.</i>

878
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,080
Pop Tarts are on your diet?

879
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,348
[Lamar] <i>Yeah.</i>

880
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,850
[Khloé] Okay. All right.

881
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,018
Bye.

882
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:28,720
[sighs]

883
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,558
[Kourtney] What's happening?
Should we sit?

884
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,527
[Khloé] God, it's so hard,
and, like, as it is,

885
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,229
just me dealing with it.

886
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,665
[dramatic music]

887
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,134
I love Mom, and I know
her intentions are super good,

888
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,437
but I feel so much pressure,
and it's just, like, everything.

889
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,406
Like how we were yesterday,
and she was like,

890
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,508
"Oh, you and Lamar should go to Craig's."

891
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,676
-It's like…
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

892
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,012
I just wanna support him
and take care of him,

893
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,647
but sometimes I get frustrated.

894
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:56,714
Like, why don't you want

895
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,483
-more for me, too?
-Yeah.

896
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,452
And why is she so on his side
and never really mine?

897
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,121
[dramatic music]

898
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,323
[Khloé] <i>I know my mom has good intentions,</i>

899
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:09,794
but I just feel like she's not getting it.

900
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,063
I really just want my space
for a minute from Lamar.

901
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,067
It's just a lot, and I feel like,
I love how much she loves our people.

902
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,735
-Yeah.
-And I also…

903
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:18,970
I don't want that to change,

904
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,406
but I just want someone to just, like,

905
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,241
care about me a little, too.

906
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,810
-Maybe that's her role.
-What?

907
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,212
Just to be the one to, like, push you.

908
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,081
Maybe it's, like, a good reminder

909
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,016
that there's other options.

910
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,052
I think you should talk to Mom.

911
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,153
Ugh.

912
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,154
[Khloé] <i>I know Kourt is right</i>

913
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,789
and I definitely have to talk to my mom.

914
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:40,992
I also don't think that this trip
is appropriate for that talk,

915
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,828
<i>so I really wanna enjoy
the rest of my trip,</i>

916
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,097
and I just will deal with this issue
when I get home.

917
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:47,999
It's getting worse and worst.

918
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,634
What do you wanna do right now?

919
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,836
[clicks tongue]
Um, I have to urinate.

Mom was so fun.

he'd even think that exists.

-Like, there's no such thing.
-[Kourtney] Obviously.

somewhere else, you know?

I just think a lot of people
have come into this family

00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,552
-and hasn't been the easiest.
-It's such a lie.

987

You guys think nothing is ever wrong.

-[Kim] It's not real.
-Are you joking?

It just seems like the guys in the family
have it a little tougher.

They definitely do. I will say that.

[Scott] Right, it's tough.

a little caught up
with this whole curse thing,

1005
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,960
and maybe taken it a little too far.

1006
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,296
All right, so maybe there's not a curse.

1007
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,733
Maybe I should stop with the excuses.

00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,637
Wait, so do you really have a rooster?

1009
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,639
Do you have a Kourtney voodoo doll

1010
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,140
is what I wanna know.

1011
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,443
No, it's… it's life-size so I can bang it.

1012
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,012
-[chuckles]
-[Kim] Where is this rooster?

1013
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,414
It's around. Don't worry about it.

1014
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,682
[Kourtney] We're gonna find it.

1015
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,717
Reign, do you wanna see a rooster?

1016
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:27,985
[Scott] Where's Mase?

1017
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,487
-He's here.
-[Kim mimics rooster crowing]

1018
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,621
[Scott] Mase.

1019
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,956
[upbeat music]

1020
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,257
[Mason] Where is he?

1021
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,992
[rooster crowing]

1022
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,494
[Kim] There he is. I see him.

1023
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,529
[Kim gasps]
I see him.

1024
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:39,597
I see him.

1025
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,065
-[Scott] Uh-oh.
-[rooster crowing]

1026
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,466
[Scott] There it is.

1027
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,869
By the way, you can't touch the rooster

1028
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,637
because he can only have my energy.

1029
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,172
-[Kourtney laughs]
-[Scott] Who knows?

1030
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,141
<i>If I tell Kourtney the rooster is, like,</i>

1031
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,776
gluten-free and organic-free…

1032
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,613
she may keep the [bleep] thing.
I don't know.

1033
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,882
I feel like I weirded you guys out
with the rooster.

1034
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,717
You think?

1035
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,254
To think, like, Kanye and I
are the most normal ones

1036
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,690
-out of this family is…
-[Kourtney] You're actually not.

1037
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:06,791
Yeah, we are.

1038
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,193
I don't know how you define normal, but…

1039
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,695
[Kim laughs]

1040
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,665
[electronic music]

1041
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,939
{\an8}[Khloé] It's always hot.
I need powder on this mug.

1042
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,876
Uh, you know, I'm obsessed
with books right now?

1043
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:30,114
I'm reading a book about Le Corbusier,

1044
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,649
which is an architect.

1045
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,517
It's so weird and boring.

1046
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,086
But I'm obsessed.

1047
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,755
No, you're not,
and you're not reading that book.

1048
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,957
-Well, I look at them.
-Right, you look at it.

1049
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,525
It's not a real book.

1050
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,027
It has words.

1051
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,362
-Oh, this building…
-Big words.

1052
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,931
…was erected in 19-whatever?

1053
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,666
Yeah, it's his… called history.

1054
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,368
That's a coffee table book.

1055
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,671
-[curtain rattling]
-[Khloé] Um…

1056
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,941
Okay, so why I wanted to talk to you

1057
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,242
-is…
-[Kris] Oh, my god.

1058
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,511
No, but, like, even this weekend,

1059
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,047
like, you just do things.

1060
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,284
So, I love Lamar with all of my heart,

1061
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,019
and I love, love, love, love him,

1062
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,887
and I want the best for him.

1063
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,189
But don't you ever

1064
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,525
think it's a cute surprise

1065
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,294
to have Lam come somewhere.

1066
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,729
You guys don't understand.

1067
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,999
It's like this snowball that starts,
like, rolling out of control.

1068
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,269
-I…
-[Kris] I understand that.

1069
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,505
-Okay, but I'm not done.
-Okay.

1070
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,675
Like, sometimes I feel like, as my mom,

1071
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,443
you should want
a little bit better for me.

1072
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,545
I'm tired of feeling trapped.

1073
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,448
When I originally needed
to file for divorce,

1074
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,483
it was the hardest thing in my life.

1075
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,585
I never wanted a divorce ever.

1076
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,787
[Kris] Yeah, I know.

1077
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,723
And so I finally had
the strength to do that.

1078
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,794
And now, I only took divorce
off the table to help him.

1079
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,362
-I understand.
-But now I feel…

1080
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,331
but now I feel back, like I'm,

1081
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:55,933
like it's the hardest thing again.
But I'm like, I…

1082
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,437
I don't look at Lamar in a romantic way.

1083
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,205
I wanna have kids one day.

1084
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,841
I might wanna get remarried one day.

1085
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:08,179
So I'm just gonna sit
in this weird space, like…

1086
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:09,914
What?

1087
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,749
I think Lamar needs us

1088
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,050
-as a family.
-Totally.

1089
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:16,020
But Lamar and I are not together.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1090
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,557
So I need to move on,

1091
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:23,094
and I will be filing for divorce
very soon.

1092
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,135
{\an8}[Khloé] Lamar and I are not together.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1093
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,271
So I need to move on,

1094
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:37,675
and I will be filing
for divorce very soon.

1095
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,614
I've been very honest with Lamar.

1096
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,816
I will still be his medical advisor,

1097
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,319
and I'll be the advisor
to all of his finances

1098
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,921
if he ever becomes incapacitated again.

1099
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,957
I want you guys
to remain friends with him.

1100
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,659
I want you guys to love him
and talk to him every day.

1101
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,229
There's no reason not to.
I have forgiven Lamar.

1102
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,531
-Yeah.
-But I still have boundaries.

1103
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,901
[Khloé] <i>I've been focusing
on Lamar for so long,</i>

1104
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,770
but it's time that I focus on me.

1105
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,204
<i>This marriage just needs to end</i>

1106
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,739
<i>and let's just see
what happens after that.</i>

1107
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:09,874
One day at a time.

1108
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,377
My point is I want him to know
he still has a family.

1109
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,112
He can still come to family dinners

1110
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,016
if I invite him or if you're like,
"Hey, do you want Lamar to come?"

1111
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,217
You could ask me.

1112
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:21,952
Yeah.

1113
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,356
Sometimes I forget
what you've gone through.

1114
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,592
You come first, and I'm here for you,

1115
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,994
-and you are going to have…
-But I want--

1116
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,129
…to tell me what my boundaries are.

1117
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,732
I understand it when you say it like that.

1118
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,367
I get it.

1119
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,769
I understand.

1120
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,238
I will be and try better.

1121
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,542
I love you. Give me a hug.

1122
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,578
-I love you so much. All right?
-Okay.

1123
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,313
I get what you're saying. I'm trying.

1124
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,749
-I'm gonna be a better mom.
-You're a great mom.

1125
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,083
And I'm gonna be more understanding

1126
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,820
and more respectful of your boundaries.
How about that?

1127
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:57,922
{\an8}[smacks lips]
We'll see how long

1128
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,691
{\an8}-this will last for.
-Okay. Live in the moment.

1129
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,762
[Kris] Nice chatting with you.

1130
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,031
[Kim] <i>Coming up next week…</i>

1131
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,532
[Kris] Welcome to Vail, kids.

1132
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,069
{\an8}-Oh.
-Oh, my [bleep].

[Khloé] <i>My dad used to take us
to Vail every year.</i>

1134
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,774
[Kourtney] It's so crazy
that we're back here.

1135
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,476
Thank you, Mom,
for putting this all together.

1136
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,543
-[Kris] I love you, guys.
-[Kim] I love you.

1137
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,846
{\an8}You think I'm, like,
the bad guy all the time.

1138
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,948
[Tyga] He still has to make
a decision as a man.

1139
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:24,849
[Kendall] Hi, Bob.

1140
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,584
I miss you.

1141
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,918
[Khloé] No.

1142
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,820
He proposed in front of her whole family?

1143
