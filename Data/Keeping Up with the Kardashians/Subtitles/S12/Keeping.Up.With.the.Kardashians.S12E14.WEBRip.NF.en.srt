An agent texted me two days ago

00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,518
and said, "Hey, there's this new player.

4
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,520
{\an8}He really is into your sister."

5
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:21,755
And I go, "Which one?"

6
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:24,924
And then he goes, "Kendall."

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,593
And then Kendall and I Googled him,

8
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,461
we decided she's not into him, whatever.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,563
So then he says, "Okay,

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,966
is the other sister, Kylie, down to talk?"

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,569
Yeah, it's just like
going through the rotation.

12
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,506
-And Kendall was like, "How dumb are you?"
-[laughs]

Malika, she's, like, the best sidekick,
'cause she's down for whatever,

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,214
but I saw Malika do
some crazy things last night.

16
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,251
I feel like this weekend, like,
was a lot of sinning.

17
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,486
A lot of sinning,
we all need to go to church.

-You don't want to go here.
-I don't have the urge,

23

so that's good. You know?

Like, living a content life…

25
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,640

-What went on?

00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,414

to Mother's Day in the last three years,

with my brother.

46
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,160
So I was more than happy
to sleep in on Mother's Day

47
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,995
and let my brother take this holiday.

00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,538
-Please.
-It's all right.

173
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,874
[Khloé] If this was anybody else,
she would cuss them out,

174
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,943
-"What the [bleep]?"
-[Kris] Damn right.

175
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,380
[Khloé] You have her wrapped
around your little finger.

176
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,650
Sauce all over her gray rug,
and she doesn't even flinch.

177
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,552
It's okay, Lammy, I got you.

178
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,454
[Khloé]
Has my mom ever gotten me a napkin ever?

179
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,924
No. Or got on her knees
to clean up after us? Never.

180
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,127
[Kris] It's all right. How are the kids?

181
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,628
[Lamar] They got so big.

182
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,363
Right? Tall.

183
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,132
Yeah, he played ball, so he just,

184
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,800
you know, he's in his own world.

185
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,336
[Kris]
Have you tried to play basketball again?

186
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,571
Just for fun?

187
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,540
-Like, dribble the ball, or…
-[Lamar] Yeah.

188
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,742
-Bounce it around for a minute?
-Mm-hm.

189
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,212
You know, Kourtney has
that basketball court.

190
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,913
-[Lamar] Yeah.
-Right down the street.

191
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,783
No. Imma go to this, um,

192
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,551
training facility in Santa Barbara.

193
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,788
A lot of pros and, um…

194
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,625
guys that would be pros work out there.

195
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,793
-[Kris] Oh, really?
-Yeah.

196
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,195
[dramatic music]

197
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,098
Basketball is obviously
Lamar's passion and love,

198
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,068
and anything that's positive
and uplifting, I'm all for,

199
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,837

200
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,038
<i>with so many things.</i>

201
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,507
Like, I need to see some consistency

202
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,975
and a little effort on Lamar's part.

203
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,811
<i>Going to a basketball camp is a big step,</i>

204
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,880
<i>and I don't want
to set him up for failure.</i>

205
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,815
[Kris] And so you would just train?

206
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:36,749
[Lamar] Yeah.

207
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,017
[Kris] That sounds really cool.

208
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,919
[Lamar]
Yeah, I'm looking forward to going.

209

[upbeat music]

210
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,231
{\an8}[Kourtney] Your hair looks cute.

211
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,132
{\an8}[Kim] The braid?

212
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,867
-Who did it?
-[Kim] Cesar.

213
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:55,935
Yeah.

214
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,603
Cute, right? Your makeup looks good.

215
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,405
Last night was awful.

216
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,908
Like, I couldn't even
Snapchat myself. I had to…

217
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,175
-It would take, like…
-I hate it

218
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,977
-when you can't Snap yourself.
-[Kourtney] It was, like,

219
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,213
would take ten times to do a Snap

220
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,548
-because it was so bad.
-Yeah.

221
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,249
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

222
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,118
[Kim]
Did I tell you what Chyna wrote to me?

223
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,352
[Kourtney] What did she write?

224
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,456
She basically told me
that she's doing animated emojis.

225
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,126
They showed Chyna hers,
Chyna sent me hers,

226
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,995
and there was one of her kicking a tiger.

227
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,097
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Kim] Like, for Tyga.

228
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,033
And she said, "Oh, I told them
to take that out."

229
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,834
"I don't want to put that one in."

230
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,603
So it'll be interesting to see…

231
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,538
She acted like she had the power.

232
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,642
<i>I think it's super cool of Chyna
to just give me the heads-up,</i>

233
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,511
just so we all know
what's going on with each other,

234
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,047
<i>since, you know, she's having
a baby with my brother.</i>

235
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,149
I really do appreciate that.

236
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,518
How was she
when you guys went to hang out?

237
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,853
She's so friendly.
Like, if you hung out with her,

238
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,156
she just would be like,
"Oh, do you want this product

239
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,490
for your skin? Oh, my friend…

240
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,758
I know exactly where to get it, hold on.

241
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,993
Let me get it for you."

242
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,562
[Kourtney]
<i>If Chyna's coming out with ChyMojis,</i>

243
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,564
it's nice that she's running it by Kim,

244
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,268
who was, like,
the original KIMOJI inventor.

245
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,571
The more time
that the family can spend with Chyna,

246
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,673
<i>hopefully, everybody can,</i>

247
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,876
like, accept that she's going
to be a part of our family.

248
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,778
She's, like, totally normal,

249
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,680
like, as if nothing, like, ever happened.

250
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,815
Yeah.

-[Khloé] Hi.

254
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,197
[Malika] Oh, yeah, comfort.

255
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,634
That's a pretty color on you.
Especially on that couch.

256
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,502
-Thank you.
-Um…

257
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,137
I need to call Elizabeth.

258
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,339
Because Lam wants,
you know, he still wants to go

259
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,542
to that basketball camp in Santa Barbara.

260
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:48,280
And I don't mind if he goes,
but I said to him,

261
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,517
"Why don't you go
to your boxing class five days a week

262
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,085
-that I've set up for you?"
-[Malika] Mm-hm.

263
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,920
"Consistent. Go five days a week.

264
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,889
And if you could follow through
five days a week

265
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,625
for one week, I'll think about it."

266
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,261
I think that's a lovely compromise.

267
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,430
He hasn't gone to one workout.

268
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,601
[Khloé] <i>I am just so conflicted right now,</i>

269
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,136
<i>and I feel guilty about it.</i>

270
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,071
I want the best for Lamar.

271
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,608
I love that he would be spending
his time in such a positive way.

272
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,210
<i>But, you know,
with everything going on lately,</i>

273
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,745
there's just not a lot of trust there.

274
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,982
There's nothing wrong with helping someone
when they're in need.

275
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,984
But you don't want to make a habit

276
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,153
of giving, giving, and giving to someone

277
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,755
that has only proven
that they're not ready to do it.

278
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,190
Yeah.

Why would this be so complicated for,

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,044
like, a normal person to use?

-I don't know what it does yet.
-[Scott] You know what time it is?

Coming up in here is like,
"Damn. I done made it."

291
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,563
Let me ask you a question.

292
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,398
Do you not think it's a little ridiculous

293
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,767
how obsessed Kourtney is
with all these allergies?

294
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,903
Yeah, well, honestly,
I don't think… I don't know.

295
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,405
Some of the things, like…

296
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,540
They change every day, number one,

297
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,943
which is not normal
when you're really allergic to something.

298
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,479
-I think it's, like, her hobby.
-Right.

"Once in a while, it's not so bad."

300
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,083
I go, "No, not once in a while."

301
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,451
Like, it doesn't work like that.

302
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,453
-No middle ground.
-[Khloé] There's no logic.

303

[Scott] <i>I know,</i>

304
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,124

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,391

The next time we're over at the house,

309
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:52,071
I think we swap out her drink
of what she usually drinks

310
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,339
and then just watch her.

311
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,840
-Regular soy and almond.
-But what if…

312
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,976
What if she really can't have it?

313
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,012

in front of me.

{\an8}[Khloé]
Hi. Did you talk to Mr. Odom yesterday?

340
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,239
-[Lamar's friend] <i>I did.</i>
-[Khloé] Okay.

341
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,275
[Lamar's friend] <i>The basketball camp is
right in the heart of Santa Barbara.</i>

342
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,612
<i>It's run by this doctor
who turned sports guru.</i>

343
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,248
[Khloé] <i>I'm on the phone
with a dear friend of Lamar's,</i>

344
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,550
and he knows very much
about this basketball camp

345
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,053
<i>and he's been through it all
with me and Lamar,</i>

346
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,722
and so he knows exactly
where I'm coming from

347
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,625
and the information that I need
to figure out what to do.

348
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,460
[Lamar's friend]
<i>I talked to Lamar recently.</i>

349
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,661
<i>I said I'm really bummed</i>

350
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,864
<i>you're not taking
everything else seriously.</i>

351
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,033
<i>Like, I'm seeing you going out,</i>
<i>you're not doing counseling.</i>

352
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,902
<i>He just doesn't have a lot of motivation.</i>

353
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,170
-[Khloé] That's an understatement.
-[Lamar's friend] <i>Now,</i>

354
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,538
<i>maybe this is a start.</i>

355
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,275
<i>Why I liked it is
'cause</i> <i>there's nothing to do up there.</i>

356
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,444
<i>You know, Santa Barbara closes early.</i>

357
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,212
<i>It's a very healthy environment.</i>

358
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,415
I'm obviously supportive
if it's something that's healthy,

359
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,118
and even if it's something
that, you know, would get him in shape

360
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,687
and make him feel good
about himself, I'm all for that.

361
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,323
[Khloé]
<i>I do feel better that this is something</i>

362
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,893
<i>that he thinks Lamar should go and do.</i>

363
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:59,431
I just want this to actually go
as smoothly as I pray it goes.

364
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,367
Well, I will figure this out

365
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,470
and I'll, uh, text you
with some information soon.

366
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,871
-[Lamar's friend] <i>All right.</i>
-Okay.

367
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,474
-[Khloé] Bye.
-You got a hair.

368
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,578
-I need to take a nap.
-Okay.

369
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,047
Okay, I'm gonna start now.

370
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,817
Five, four, three, two, one, done.

371
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,085
[chuckles softly]

372
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,222
[upbeat music]

373
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,872
[Yu Tsai] Do you need coffee, tea

374
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,273
-or anything?
-[Kourtney] Okay.

375
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,408
-[Yu Tsai] Tea?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

376
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,678
You don't even know the drama yesterday
that was happening.

377
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,279
{\an8}What? What happened?

378
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:53,152
{\an8}Like, um, did you see
the ChyMojis or whatever?

379
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,954
I didn't see them, but I heard about them.

380
00:15:55,554 --> 00:16:00,592
Yesterday, Chyna's emojis come out,
and there's just some

381
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,495
that we all don't even know
what to think about.

382
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,030
[Kourtney] It really threw me off.

383
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:09,101
There was, like, one of, um,
her slapping Kylie.

384
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,004
-Did you see it?
-No, I didn't see them.

385
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,372
[Mario] Is it for sure Kylie though?

386
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,674
[Kourtney] That's, like,
what everyone was saying online.

387
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,911
Just when everybody was trying
to be really accepting

388
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,881
and welcoming Chyna
into the family, this comes out,

389
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,018
and I think that we all are
just, like, confused.

390
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,953
It says, "Surely, that's not Kylie…

391
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,890
Blac Chyna slaps Jenner look-alike
in daring new emoji."

392
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:34,393
And then, look,
there's a picture of her without…

393
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,696
{\an8}[Kourtney] Totally.

394
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,531
-The lips.
-[Mario] The big lips, yeah.

395
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,667
[Kourtney] It sent me over the edge.

396
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,603
Everything with Rob,
I always try to be super calm,

397
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,206
but I was just, like, in a mood.

398
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:51,176
So I was gonna call Chyna,
and then Kylie was like,

399
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,480
"No, just call Rob.
Like, it's too crazy to call Chyna."

400
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,149
And I'm like, "I don't want to yell
at a pregnant person."

401
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,717
[Mario] So, wait, what did you say to Rob?

402
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,486
[Kourtney] I yelled at him.

403
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:04,456
[Kourtney] <i>This is the first time
that made me question</i>

404
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,692
<i>Chyna's intentions.</i>

405
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,229
Like, I usually don't let
any of this kind of stuff bother me.

406
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,965
<i>But for some reason,
this just sets me off.</i>

407
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:17,102
I just had to call Rob. And Rob's like,

408
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,772
<i>"It's not Kylie.
When has she ever slapped Kylie?"</i>

409
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,774
<i>And I'm like, "I don't know."</i>

410
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,643
But, you know, I just really upset him.

411
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,813
But didn't he see that,
didn't he see them, the emojis?

412
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,615
[Kourtney] Yeah, but he's like,

413
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,450
"What do you care
if she's, like, doing this?"

414
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,152
"Everyone has emojis."

415
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,254
I'm like, "I don't care
that she has them."

416
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,922
"I care that it was Kylie."

417
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,191
[phone ringing]

418
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,794
{\an8}-Hey, Khlo.
-[Khloé] <i>You okay?</i>

419
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,229
<i>What is going on with all the Kimojis?</i>

420
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,565
And I showed Mario Kylie,

421
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,667
and he's like, "That is for sure Kylie."

422
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,302
[Khloé]
<i>It's all online, saying it's Kylie!</i>

423
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,071
[Kourtney] I went off on him yesterday.

424
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,940
He's like, "I'm gonna go
on the red carpet tonight,

425
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,176
and I'm gonna tell everybody
how I have the worst,

426
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,012
most unsupportive, disgusting family."

427
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,914
Like, ridiculous.

428
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,818
But I think that it's stupid
to take it there.

429
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,522
[Khloé]<i> I actually have a good tweet
that I'm gonna do. It's a subliminal.</i>

430
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,291
What? Your subliminal tweets

431
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,992
are not subliminal.
[chuckles]

432
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,360
[Khloé] <i>Okay, I'm out.</i>

433
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,995
[Kourtney] Okay, love you.

434
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,400
[upbeat techno music]

435
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,740
{\an8}[Kylie]
Khlo, I really need food. I'm like…

436
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,909
{\an8}[Khloé] So eat,
there's so much food in my fridge.

437
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,077
-[Kylie] I don't know what to eat.
-[Khloé] I don't know what's wrong

438
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,445
-with you.
-[Kylie] Maybe I'll try

439
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,482
some chicken risotto.
I kind of want a sweet potato too.

440
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,549
[Khloé] Okay.

441
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,018
There's only so much I can do
with one hand.

442
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,987
[Kylie]
Let's cut this open and see what it is.

443
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,859
What is that?

444
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,327
It's chicken of some sort.

445
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,795
Doesn't look like chicken to me.

446
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,564
Oh, it doesn't? Well, I don't eat
anything else but chicken.

447
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,932
All right.

448
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,268
[Khloé]
My text was ruthless yesterday, huh?

449
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,403
[tense music]

450
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,341
-Yeah.
-[Khloé] This emoji situation.

451
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,110
Can you believe
Kourt got so upset yesterday?

452
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,345
[Kylie] Yeah, so upset.

453
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,748
And for Kourtney to get upset,
you know it's a big deal.

454
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,883
Mm-hm.

455
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,319
[Khloé] Aren't you upset
that Chyna made an emoji about you?

456
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,022
You think that looks like me,
with the thick brows

457
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,057
and side bang and purple lips?

458
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,161
[Kylie] I've never worn
that hairstyle before, right?

459
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,729
[Khloé] You've worn every hairstyle.

460
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,764
I really think it looks like this girl

461
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,267
that she hates
that she had a public fight with.

462
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,103
There's so much misunderstanding going on.

463
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,773
I know everyone is really upset,
but I talked to Chyna,

464
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,509
<i>and I really don't think
the emojis are of me.</i>

465
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,378
<i>I'm really tired of my family
fighting with Rob</i>

466
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,879
<i>over every little thing.</i>

467
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,881
He is expecting a baby,

468
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,517
<i>and it's time for everyone
to just be happy for him.</i>

469
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,252
I just found out it's a lot easier

470
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,221
when, like, everyone gets along.

471
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,723
[Khloé] I know I'll talk
to him again, it's my brother.

472
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,593
[Kylie] So, who is this person
that cooks all this for you?

473
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,628
Mr. Odom's chef.

474
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,130
-[Khloé chuckles]
-Mm-hm.

475
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,200
[Khloé] Um…

476
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,735
Yesterday, I called Lam, and I was like,

477
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,205
"I'm looking for house rentals
in Santa Barbara."

478
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,539
[Kylie] Oh, wow.

479
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,508
[Khloé] And then, he was like,

480
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,843
"I'm having really bad cravings."

481
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,645
And I was like,
"You should talk to someone.

482
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,048
Like, I don't know how to help you.
Like, I wish I did."

483
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,250
[Kylie] That's crazy.

484
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,685
[Khloé] <i>I want this for Lamar.</i>

485
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,653
<i>Lamar has been really honest about,</i>

486
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,322
<i>you know, the thoughts he's been having,</i>

487
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,459
but at the same time,
my answer to that is, like,

488
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,295
"I think you should see someone
that could help you with this."

489
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,364
But Lamar won't do that.

490
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,033
And so that's really, again, frustrating.

491
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,636
You can't do anything
if the person's not willing

492
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,972
to take control of their life
and get help.

493
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,911
{\an8}[upbeat music]

494
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,051
[Scott] Have you gotten
into the new house yet or not?

495
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,353
[Kylie] No, but now I'm in escrow.

496
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,588
Are you gonna be able to gate
your property now?

497
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,790
Yeah. And then, eventually,

498
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,526
if I get older
and I just always have those properties,

499
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,764
I could tear down the whole thing
and, like, build a house.

500
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,966
Maybe you could attach the two houses.

501
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,068
-Yeah, like, something.
-And just make a compound,

502
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,104
and then it just comes through the middle.

503
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,108
So what did you need me for?

504
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,311
I need you to help me

505
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,979
'cause I really truthfully believe

506
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,615
that Kourtney has made up in her head

507
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,384
that she's highly allergic

508
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,718
-to every single thing…
-[laughs]

509
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,553
-…on the face of the planet.
-I know.

510
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,489
[Scott]
<i>Now that Khloé's not gonna participate</i>

511
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,925
with switching out all the foods
to "the allergic stuff,"

512
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,029
<i>I've decided Kylie needs to be
my accomplice here.</i>

513
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:40,599
I mean, I trust her,
and we'll see what happens.

514
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,867
She's just lost it.

515
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,002
I don't even think
she knows what gluten is.

516
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,171
I don't. Do you?

517
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,774
-No.
-Does anybody?

518
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,043
I'm sure.

519
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:55,547
So, my point is, I'm saying,
I want you to distract her,

520
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:59,718
I want to replace
everything she has with regular dairy,

521
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,321
regular gluten, regular soy,

522
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,489
and then we'll see the end result.

523
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,491
Okay.

524
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,194
That's it. Plain and simple.

525
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,531
Plain and simple.

526
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,300
[techno music]

527
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,941
{\an8}[Scott] So, let's find her,
and then you distract her.

528
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,810
{\an8}And then I'll come back
and get the groceries.

529
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,746

Smells like a gluten-free grilled cheese.

[Scott] Yeah, aka, horse [bleep].

531

-[Kylie] Kourtney?
-[Kourtney] Hi.

532
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:34,920
[Kylie] Hey.

533
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,521
-[Kourtney] Cutting P's nails.
-[Scott gasps]

534
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:37,956
[Scott] Hi, Paloosh.

535
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,859
So you're getting your nails done?

536
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:41,993
Mm-hm.

537
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,831
You have a little gray hair.
Do you want me to pull it out?

538
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:46,898
[Kourtney] No.

539
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,834
-You like it? Okay.
-[Kourtney] Live for them.

540
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,070
All right, I'm gonna go downstairs
and eat some food.

541
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,573
[Scott] I'll be back.

542
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,007
You never eat here.

543
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,411
-I have my lunch. It's salad.
-[Kourtney] Oh.

544
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:00,979
[sniffles]

545
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,118
I know it's all psychological
with Kourtney thinking

546
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,452
that she has all these allergies.

547
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,688
<i>And she makes up
these elaborate stories, like…</i>

548
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,224
[gasps]
"Oh, well, this one time I had gluten,

549
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,126
<i>and I had a little goosebump on my arm."</i>

550
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,294
I'm like, "Maybe that's just
'cause you're wearing a T-shirt,

551
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,462
and you're in the middle
of a ski mountain."

552
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,531
<i>So I definitely think this is some place</i>

553
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,901
where I can prove to her
that it's not real, then.

-[phone chiming]

556
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:36,948
Should we go down there?

557
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,818
Mm…

[mischievous music continues]

559
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,025
[Kylie] I'm just gonna tell you.

560
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,794
-What?
-'Cause I feel awkward.

561
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,862
-What?
-But he's… he's…

562
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,500
He's switching your food downstairs.

563
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,735
My food?

564
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,137
'Cause he thinks that your gluten allergy

565
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,772
-is, like, a joke, so he…
-Yeah, he does.

566
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,340
So he's switching all of them.

567
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:08,046
Scott just doesn't understand
why me and the kids

568
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,515
have to be gluten-free, dairy-free,

569

<i>and it may not seem like a big deal,</i>

570

<i>but it's, like, it's an allergy, so…</i>

571
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,489
I… It's just annoying.

572
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,226
By the way, like,
he should know of anyone.

573
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,695
-He's lactose intolerant.
-And I just want to tell you,

574
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,665
'cause, like, I don't know
if you're, like, really allergic

575
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,099
and something might happen.

576
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,837
He, like, doesn't believe me,
so he'll go against my ways.

577
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,004
Yeah.

578
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,474
Okay, don't tell him that I know.

00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,608

-Good to see you.

585

I'm gonna sit over here.
So I can gaze into your eyes.

586

{\an8}What took you so long?

587
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,702
{\an8}-There was a lot of traffic.
-[Kim] I was at a doctor's--

coming from Beverly Hills.

-Like, there's so much…
-[Scott] So much.

-[Kim] …traffic here all the time.
-Rodeo was, like, shut down.

'Cause we were over there shopping.

00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,676
-[Leon] Yeah.

Uh, we'll take some Brussels sprouts,
sounds good.

595
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,284
-[Leon] Yeah.
-[Scott] So, you know,

596
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,052
I've heard Kourtney talk about

597
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,257
all these little emojis
about Chyna and whatnot.

598
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,126
And I said to Kourt,
I go, "But in all honesty, like,

599
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,096
there is such a bigger picture here
we do need to think about."

600
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:34,699
"Like, your brother,
whether what terms everyone's on with him,

601
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,236
is gonna have a child with this woman
for the rest of his life."

602
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,938
"That's it."

603
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,306
-[Leon] Yeah.
-[Scott] Like, forget it, who cares?

604
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,041
-Like, there's a bigger picture.
-Yeah.

605
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,309
[Scott]
And I told Kourtney and she was like,

606
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,610
"All right, I'm still annoyed."

607
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,946

like, sit back, be supportive,</i>

he hasn't cared enough to call you.

-[Penelope] No.

668
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,021
I didn't cry.

669
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,890
-[Kourtney] She didn't even move.
-[Kris] You didn't cry?

670
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,325
-[Kourtney] Nothing, right?
-What?

671
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,893
Just a little bit.

672
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,030
Mase, what do you feel like?
Gluten-free pasta?

673
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,032
-[Mason] Yeah.
-[Kourtney] Okay.

674
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:59,137
So, Scott was over the other day
and saying that,

675
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,172
like, our allergies aren't real

676
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,975
and that we don't need to be on that diet.

677
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,144
So anyways, he came over and, like,

678
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:11,015
switched out our non-dairy milk
with real milk.

679
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,519
But then Kylie told me
before we even had it.

680
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,654
Did you tell him that you found out?

681
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,556
-Mm-mm.
-[chuckles]

682
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,159
I feel like I could pretend
to be really sick.

683
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,061
That's a good one.

684
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,897
I think you should say
that you're super sick

685
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,501
and you have to go to the doctor's.

686
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:30,869
[chuckles]

687
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,837
Scott, in a million years,

688
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,672
would never think that I would get sick,

689
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,308
<i>so it is, like, a great opportunity</i>

690
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,711
<i>to just get to make him feel bad,</i>

691
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,580
because he just needs
to learn a lesson to, like,

692
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,784
get out of my business
about, like, what I'm eating.

693
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,521
That is amazing. Payback is a bitch.

694
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,824
Hey, watch your language.

695
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,393
Oh, my god.

696
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,863
Between the food and the non-cussing,
I would go crazy.

[Lamar's friend]
<i>Do you know if he's shady?</i>

702
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,651
{\an8}I know he was around
during, like, a bizarre time,

703
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,153
{\an8}but I don't know for sure.

704
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,190
One of Lamar's friends has called me
and is, you know,

705
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:29,160
notifying me that Lamar is hanging out
with bad guys again.

706
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,095
<i>And it saddens me.</i>

707
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,497
I know Lamar wants better,

708
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,400
I know Lamar wants to excel
and be on a good path,

709
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,335
but he just can't help it.

710
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,338
[Khloé] I'm just at a loss of,
like, so what do we do anyway?

711
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,507
I've tried every single thing.

712
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,842
[Lamar's friend] <i>I know you have.</i>

713
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,977
Nothing's gonna wake him up.

714
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,012
That's where the biggest problem is.

715
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,949
I thought he was really gonna change,

716
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,851
but, like, this is Lamar.

-[Kris] Yeah?

719
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,565
God, I thought you'd never get here.

720
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,900
[Scott] What do you mean "never get here?"

721
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,501
I just drove
100 miles an hour to get here.

722
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,970
You've got to come see Kourtney

723

because I don't know what's wrong,

724
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,874

to the hospital.

[Kourtney grunts weakly]

00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,216
[Kris] I think she's eaten something

729
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,619
that she's not…
that's not agreeing with her.

She's fine. Are you guys kidding?

00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,062
Kourtney sucks at this.

her partner in crime anymore.</i>

734

I mean, this is epic,
but Kourtney's like, "Whatever."

735
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,571
She's just not a very good actor.

736
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,642
[Scott] Hello? She's fine.

There's nothing wrong with this kid.

[Scott] This is ridiculous.

741
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,218
She doesn't look sick,
she's just decked out,

742
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,619
hair and makeup.

743
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,289

she's going to the Oscars.

-[Kourtney] Kylie.
-Kylie told you?

748
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,132
But just because it's like, it's a choice.

749
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:15,833
But I don't think it's fair
to tell everyone

750
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,568
you're allergic to all these things.

751
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,470
And then go have a glass of milk
or eat a big ice cream,

752
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,139
and be like, "Oh, it's a cheat day."

753
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,074
You can't cheat on allergies.

754
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,709
[Scott] <i>The fact that she thinks</i>

755
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,346
that she can take "off days"
of being allergic,

00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,814
that doesn't work in America, lady.

757

<i>Or anywhere else in this world.</i>

758
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,719
It's absolutely ridiculous,
and I'm appalled.

759
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,922
Listen. Some people choose to be vegans,

760
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,591
some people choose to be vegetarian.

761
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,393
-Great.
-We are choosing to be

762
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,128
-dairy-free.
-[Scott] You're choosing to lie

763
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,663
and say you're allergic.

764
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,931
-That's fair too.
-[Kris] It's her choice. She's--

765
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,500
-Okay, okay. So I…
-Maybe just don't use the word "allergic."

00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,670
[Kourtney]
<i>Since Scott is being ridiculous,</i>

767
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:57,141
I won't call
my diet restrictions an allergy,

768
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,811
since that seems to be offending Scott.

769
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:03,448
I'll just say
that it's, like, a healthy lifestyle.

-I…

-step outside of here…

then you'll see
a colonial and Old English,

00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,033
[upbeat music]

834
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,878
-I did that. And that.
-[Kourtney] Ooh.

835
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,881
[gasps]
Mase, that guy's the best.

836
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,149
With that heart.

837
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,984
[Mason] I'm gonna make them mermen.

838
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,620
[Kourtney] That's so good.

839
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,990
Well, I love this mermaid.

840
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,059
-[Khloé] Do you know all these states?
-No.

841
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,728
[Khloé] You're not even looking at them.

842
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,030
-[Mason speaking indistinctly]
-How was your night? What did you do?

843
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,867
[Khloé] Honestly, Kim, I…
I don't want to talk about it.

844
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,904
It was, like, five steps backwards.

845
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,472
I don't even know what to do.

846
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,840
[tense music]

847
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,275
-How crazy.
-[Khloé] And I said,

848
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,278
"You know, like,
you could die right now, right?"

849
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,281
[Khloé] <i>Lamar and I talked about…</i>

850
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,516
the demons he's been battling recently.

851
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:29,387
<i>And he doesn't realize
how erratic I think he's acting,</i>

852
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,888
<i>'cause it… he can't help it.</i>

853
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,357
And I'm just like,
"God, I thought all this was over."

854
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,731
[Kim]
I'll go over there today if you want,

855
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,266
and I can talk to him, or I can, like,

856
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,968
have Kanye come and help talk to him.

857
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,370
[tense music continues]

858
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,876
Like, why do I treat him
better than I treat myself?

859
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,781
[Kim]
I mean, I feel like maybe you shouldn't…

860
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,116
put so much energy into it.

861
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,886
You know, you'll always be there,
but you can't, you know,

862
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,255
baby him and be his, like, mom.

863
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,991
Like, with Scott, like, it's like,

864
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,427
I don't tell him, "Don't do this or that."

865
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,863
And it feels so good to let it go,

866
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,665
but it's hard because, at the same time,

867
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,534
you don't want the person to die.

868
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,671
Well, that's just what's gonna happen.

869
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,740
[somber music]

870
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,446
I feel really strongly
there's only one outcome.

871
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,583
You know, I've always hoped
that Lamar seeing

872
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,486
everyone that rallied around him
during a dark time

873
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,022
<i>and everyone who's rooting
for a comeback story</i>

874
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,558
and everyone that wants
to see Lamar do well

875
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:44,762
and just succeed in life,
just win at the game of life.

876
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,064
I think that's where,

877
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,367
I always put all my eggs into that basket.

878
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,902
And it… whether it be my personal family,

879
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,638
or the fans of the world,

880
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,939
<i>or just everyone that's praying for him,</i>

881
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,842
it really is so moving how much everyone…

882
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,177
was rooting for Lamar.

883
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:04,181
Except him. So it is disappointing.

884
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,883
I just think, in your mind,

885
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,953
you have to be, like,
prepared for the worst.

886
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,722
And try your best.

887
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,093
[calm music]

888
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,973
{\an8}You know you gave me these jeans
a long time ago?

889
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,076
Oh, my god. Those are the jeans
that I wore when I was in Spain.

890
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,579
I love them. They're a 27,
but, like, they fit me.

891
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,014
So, like, they would never fit me,

892
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,215
but my goal was just to see--

893
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,251
-These would never fit you.
-[Kim] I know, I know.

894
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,053
But I'm saying,
like, in, like, six months.

895
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,690
What are we gonna do
about, like, Khloé and Lamar?

896
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,161
I feel like she just, like,
did so much thinking,

897
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,663
like, this was it and, like,
they're gonna get back together.

898
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,433
And, like, she's gonna,
like, help save him.

899
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,435
I don't think she thought that.

900
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,903
-Really?
-[Kourtney] No.

901
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,671
I think, deep down inside,
she thought, like,

902
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,173
-"What if this works out?"
-I don't.

903
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,275
-I don't. I don't.
-Really?

904
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,776
-Oh, I so think that.
-[Kourtney] She…

905
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,411
I don't think she thinks,

906
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,448
"I want to spend my life
with him and have kids with him."

907
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,150
Because, like, where's the trust?

908
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,720
-And where's…
-The normalcy?

909
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,522
I just don't think
that's the situation she wants.

910
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,858
Yeah, but I think she feels,
like, tied to him.

911
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:21,992
[Kourtney] Of course.

912
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,628
She feels tied to him,
and she feels responsible,

913
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,031
and she feels like she's all he has.

914
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,366
Yeah, totally.

915
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,603
[Kourtney] <i>When it comes to Lamar,
I know that Khloé has,</i>

916
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,905
<i>you know, been through it all with him.</i>

917
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,675
Khloé has given everything,
she's tried everything.

918
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,245
{\an8}<i>You know, I can give her
as much advice as I can,</i>

919
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,949
but, like, there's only so much
that she can do.

920
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,353
[Kim] <i>Next on</i>
Keeping Up with the Kardashians…

921
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,323
I don't want to send him
the wrong message.

922
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,761
Scott invited me
to his birthday party in Las Vegas.

923
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,829
[Kourtney] Ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah!

924
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,866
So have you talked to Khloé lately?

925
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,667
-No.
-She misses her brother.

926
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,936
She should be careful what she says.

927
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,372
And you all aren't welcoming
of this relationship,

928
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,341
-so it's not that easy.
-I've missed you.

929
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,810
Why won't you even look at me?

930
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,011
[Rob groans]
