00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,918
…three years ago. Now, you're on.

171
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,686
-[Khloé] No, but it was [bleep] with me.
-Yeah, you're good.

172
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,054
It was my whole life,
it's [bleep] with me.

173
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,690
Then I had
about two and a half solid years

174
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,725
where she was pregnant and I was good.

175
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,060
And now, she's, like, back.

176
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,795
You didn't think
she was gonna get this back?

177
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,966
Like, she has this…
which I don't-- I don't have this,

178
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,235
'cause she has big tits and a small waist,

179
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,503
-and a big ass.
-[Kim] I wish my--

180
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,506
I literally took a screengrab
of your… of your shirt,

181
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,974
when we were in New York.

182
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,009
Your boobs were, like, fully,

183
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,479
-perfectly perky, up. I have--
-[Khloé] There's no boobs.

184
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,980
-There's no cleavage. Look at that.
-I wish.

185
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,381
-[Khloé] I wish.
-I wish.

186
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,116
I have no waist because I have no tits.

187
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,152
If I get tits, I'll have a waist.

188
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,956
Ever since I've lost weight,
you lose weight everywhere,

189
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,758
so I've lost some extra cleavage

190
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,694
that once helped these things look
a little bigger.

191
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,064
Now, I feel a good more bottom heavy
than top heavy,

192
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,565
and I want to have, like…

193
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,968
you know, the hourglass thing going on.

194
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:25,505
It's really now, like,
I'm, like, really irritated.

195
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,240
-Well…
-[Khloé] I had the best workout

196
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,009
this morning and now I feel like
I need to go work out again.

197
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,278
-Why, what'd you do?
-Just look at Kim.

198
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,547
[Jonathan] Inspiration.

199
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,849
[upbeat music]

200
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,258
{\an8}[Kourtney] You're just such a hater.

201
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,627
{\an8}[Scott] How am I a hater? On what?

202
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,562
-On everything.
-Tell me which part.

203
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,264
I had no idea that I was such a hater.

204
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,999
Just 'cause I try to help you.
I won't help again.

205
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,100
Okay.

206
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,102
In London, I was trying to help you
with your outfits.

207
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,303
[Kourtney] No, you said,

208
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,239
"Everyone's texting me, congratulating me

209
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,807
that you're pregnant with my kid,

210
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,876
because you look pregnant in this photo."

211
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,845
-You said that to somebody?
-That's not a hater.

212
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,146
I always try to give you compliments

213
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,447
and tell you what looks good
and what doesn't.

214
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,384
Being a hater is saying, "Hey, do you--"

215
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,619
Oh, you said,
"Do you edit your Snapchats?"

216
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,954
-I never said that.
-[Kourtney] Yeah, you did.

217
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,123
You said, "Do you edit your Snapchats?"

218
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,958
I said, "You can't edit Snapchats."

219
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,961
-"And no, I don't take time to do that."
-[Scott] I never asked that.

220
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,863
-Yeah, you did.
-I said Instas.

221
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,098
Mm-mm. You said Snapchats.

222
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,167
I don't even know about Snapchat.
You could edit it?

223
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,069
I don't edit mine.

224
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,037
I don't think you can.

225
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,772
[Kourtney] Drinking that Haterade.

226
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,044
So, I finally made my plans
for the summer.

227
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,246
-Are the kids gonna be in camp?
-[Kourtney clears throat]

228
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,348
-[Kourtney] No.
-[Kris] What are you gonna do?

229
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,983
We're gonna go out of town for a month.

230
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,184
For a month?

231
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,086
Mm-hm. Like, three weeks.

232
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,721
Are you going?

233
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,023
I'm trying to understand what she's doing.

234
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,726
-[Kris] Is Scott going?
-No.

235
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,030
I'll send you guys an itinerary,
but it's top secret, for now.

236
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,966
<i>It's the middle of the summer</i>

237
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,202
and it's, like, really important to me
to take time with my kids

238
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,238
and just get out of town, and live life.

239
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:10,042
I have an idea of some places
that we wanna go,

240
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,379
but I haven't really figured out exactly

241
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,513
what we're going to do.

242
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,482
I just wanna see
where the summer takes us.

243
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,451
Okay, listen.

244
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,786
We're gonna have the best summer ever,

245
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,888
and you're gonna go on an amazing vacation

246
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,956
with the three kids.

247
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,658
And you should be looking at this like,

248
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,793
"Wow, she's taking the kids
on a vacation."

249
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,328
They could be stuck at home.

250
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,931
Like, walking around the house
driving you crazy.

251
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,666
-And you could be babysitting.
-I like that.

252
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,201
[dramatic music]

253
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,703
There's 11 other months out of the year
you can do that.

254
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,639
You know, hearing Kourtney say

255
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,441
that she's gonna go on
some month-long vacation,

256
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,543
<i>I realize that Kourtney and I
aren't together,</i>

257
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,481
but we do spend, like,
every day together with the kids.

258
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,350
It does feel like a very, very long time.

259
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:52,918
She's just annoying.

260
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,186
[Scott] She's just so rude.

261
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,422
[imitates Kourtney]
Like, let me find out and tell you

262
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,424
the day before.

263
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,427
-She's just playing with you.
-No, she's not.

264
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,332
[upbeat music]

265
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,040
{\an8}Your last fragrance launch was in 2014.

266
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,910
So, critical time right now
to really build a brand new signature.

267
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,146
-[Kim] Mm-hm.
-You've evolved. You've changed.

268
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,714
[Kim] Yeah, I think new name,

269
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,782
-new logo.
-Yeah,

270
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,550
-we should.
-Like, it could be Kim Kardashian West,

271
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,218
-you know, instead of…
-[Kris] Yeah.

272
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,386
-With a new logo and, like…
-[Kris] That's great.

273
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,454
[publicist 1] Absolutely.

274
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,956
So, everyone will know,
like, the Kim Kardashian stuff

275
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,959
and Kim Kardashian West is all,
like, the new stuff.

276
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,896
I am so excited to relaunch my fragrance.

277
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,431
It's, like, a whole new team,

278
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,133
and I just loved working
on all of my fragrances before,

279
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,835
and I'm excited to have a new one.

280
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,604
I mean, I love, like, obviously,
Elizabeth Taylor

281
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,640
and what she's done
with her fragrance business,

282
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,008
-even, you know…
-[publicist 2] It's tremendous business.

283
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,076
-…after her passing.
-Yes.

284
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,477
[Scott] Yo.

285
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,578
-[Kris] Hey.
-[publicist 2] Hi.

286
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,879
What's, uh… what's happening over here

287
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,548
-at this big table?
-[laughter]

288
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,916
Our big business meeting.

289
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,217
-Fragrance meeting.
-Fragrance meeting.

290
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,752
Oh, it smells good in here.

-[laughter]
-[gasps]

292
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,621
-I was kidding. It's the pastries.
-[publicist 1] Well put.

293
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,723
[publicist 2] Well put.

294
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,491
If you're nice to me, I might do

295
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,127
-a Scott Disick men's cologne.
-Yes.

296
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,030
I'd love to get something, that, uh, says,

297
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,699
"I like you, but still, [bleep] off"
at the same time.

298
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,568
-[laughter]
-Okay.

299
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,936
-Wait, what are you doing?
-[publicist 1] I think it sounds like

300
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,504
-the best seller.
-I thought we were hanging out today.

301
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,473
-Were we?
-[Scott] Yeah.

302
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,808
Whatever. I mean, it's cool.
I'll just wait for a little bit.

303
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,110
<i>Kourtney and the kids</i>

304
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,644
just left town a couple of days ago.

305
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,280
And it already feels like
they've been gone about a year.

306
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,949
<i>It's definitely difficult. I mean,</i>

307
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,717
I'm used to seeing my kids
every single day.

308
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,886
<i>Any time I have too much time on my hands,</i>

309
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,721
<i>I'm not exactly sure what to do.</i>

310
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,590
-So, it's hard.
-[Kim] I feel really bad

311
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,126
I have so many meetings. Can we, uh…

312
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,895
I thought you said yesterday
we'll go run around.

313
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,130
Go to Maria's.

314
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,464
[Kim] I know, but I totally forgot.

315
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,766
Please don't be mad at me.

316
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:47,967
-Please, please, please.
-[Scott] I'm not mad. It just…

317
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,101
it felt like you made plans.

318
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,703
[Kim]
I know, but this house meeting came up.

319
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,037
-[Scott] All right. Bye.
-[Kim] Bye.

320
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,274
[upbeat music]

321
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,381
{\an8}[Khloé]
I've just got to tailor up some jeans.

322
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,816
{\an8}[Monica] Okay.

323
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,651
[Khloé] 'Cause I'm so thin.

324
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,753
You are too skinny, please stop.

325
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,055
And because I'm so thin,
I don't have boobies anymore.

326
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,724
Well, we wanna get boobs one day.

327
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,193
Wait, I'm obsessed with your boobs.

328
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,761
I don't think you need boobs.

329
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,897
[Monica]
And you have that bra that literally…

330
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,498
-makes your boobs--
-[Khloé] I know, but not everyone wants

331
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,733
to wear a bra all the time.

332
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,269
I thought about getting my boobs done
for years.

333
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,037
Never really that serious about it,

334
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,973
because I've always had
somewhat decent-sized boobs.

335
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,375
<i>But now I'm thinking,</i>

336
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,510
"Okay, well, maybe I want
to get my boobs done."

337
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,580
I got these. Do you know
they sell these with nipples?

338
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,348
I don't want big boobs, I just want…

339
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,817
-Oh, my god.
-What in the hell?

340
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,718
-[Monica laughs]
-[Khloé and Monica] Hi.

341
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,053
[Scott] What are you holding on there?

342
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,556
Monica and I were just talking
about boobs.

343
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,424
-Those are nice boobs.
-You came into a…

344
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,459
-really good conversation.
-[Khloé] You really scared me.

345
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,528
I want more, like, full…

346
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,297
what is it, like, full circumference.

347
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,364
-[Monica] But you are a "C."
-You want a little more

348
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,233
-side boob.
-[Khloé] I'm really a "B" now.

349
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,001
[Scott]
If you're gonna be so bottom heavy,

350
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,570
-you got to be top too.
-Right. Like,

351
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,071
-don't you think I need bigger boobs?
-Yeah.

352
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,739
She's like a big booty ho

353
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,107
-video vixen.
-Yeah.

354
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,109
[Scott] She needs to be up and popping.

355
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,811
-[Monica] Well, let's try the dress on.
-Yeah.

356
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,546
-[Scott] Let's get those titties popping.
-[chuckles]

357
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,448
[upbeat music]

358
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,852
[Scott] Ooh, let me see what's popping.

359
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:18,257
-Ooh! Getting them titties on.
-[Khloé] The other one? Give it to me.

360
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,026
[Scott] Pop that bad boy in here.

361
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,595
Now that's proportional.

362
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,929
[Scott] Pow, pow!

363
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,831
[Khloé] But Scott, you don't think
my butt shrunk?

364
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,334
I mean, it's still out there
and living the dream.

365
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,902
[Monica] I have these.

366
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,371
That's kind of just, put it on the side,

367
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,106
so it just gives it a little…

368
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,309
-[Khloé] Oh!
-Ooh. Shake and bake.

369
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,011
Scott, that's very inappropriate.

370
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,646
[Scott] I want to make sure
that you're good.

371
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,514
I know how you like it rough.
[chuckles]

372
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,316
I don't think it looks bad
the way it is, Khlo.

373
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,784
I have fake boobs in here right now.

374
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,721
Like I said, I don't think it looks bad.

375
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,689
Look, if you saw me
at a wedding like this,

376
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,658
-would you be like…
-[Scott] If you were with a date

377
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,826
-or without a date?
-No, either…

378
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,561
-Would you be like…
-Either way, I'd be like, "Damn!"

379
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,363
"…I wish that bitch was on my arm."

380
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,797
[Scott] On my [bleep], not arm.

381
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,266
-Okay.
-[Monica] You are not allowed

382
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,667
at my fittings anymore.

383
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,103
Monica, I love you
and I think you do an amazing job.

384
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,337
Just let her get a little tittie on.

385
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,238
[laughs]
Oh, my god.

386
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,806
-I mean, [bleep] it.
-[Khloé] I hate him.

387
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,541
Okay, let me throw these on.

388
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,143
Oh, my god!

389
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,045
-Kim K.
-Hi, guys.

390
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,446
[Khloé] Do you like these boobs?

391
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,749
[Kim] Why on earth
would you want to get your boobs done?

392
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,785
I think it, like,
so suits you and fits you.

393
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,954
Do you know how much
of a confidence builder this is?

394
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,423
What are you doing in here?
This… Kourtney…

395
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,925
This is, like, really inappropriate.

396
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,559
-For who, Khloé or me?
-[Khloé] No, Scott…

397
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,228
-[Kim] Both of you.
-Scott and I do this

398
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,462
all the time.
[laughs]

399
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,866
Obviously, these implants are not
the real thing,

400
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,335
but I love the way they look.
[chuckles]

401
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,903
[Scott] Wow. Now you're talking.

402
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,405
Get the--
But you got to hold them up, right.

403
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,140
All of a sudden,
you can dance like a stripper.

404
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,509
Get it, girl. Show me
what you're working with.

405
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,411
[upbeat music]

406
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,018
[Kim] Should I try to go up here?

407
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,086
I've never been this way.

408
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,587
I just want to experiment.

409
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,256
But do you know where you're going?

410
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,758
Oh, don't tell me
there's a lot of traffic right here.

411
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,660
[phone ringing]

412
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,795
[Kim] Hi.

413
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,263
[Caitlyn] <i>Kimmy.</i>

414
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,799
{\an8}Caitlyn.

415
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,101
{\an8}<i>Baby, how ya doin'?</i>

416
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,071
{\an8}Good. I'm just riding
around town with Khloé.

417
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,505
[Khloé] Hey, Cait.

418
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,574
<i>Baby, I haven't seen you forever.</i>

419
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,944
Yeah, we texted the other day.

420
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,612
<i>Oh, just briefly.</i>

421
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,481
-Briefly, yeah.
-[Caitlyn] <i>Yeah.</i>

422
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,217
<i>But anyway, Kim, I got a, uh, a request.</i>

423
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,453
-Yeah?
-[Caitlyn] <i>Are you ready?</i>

424
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,254
-Yes, I'm ready.
-<i>All right.</i>

425
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,023
<i>I got to do the ESPYs next week.</i>

426
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,726
<i>I was thinking,
why don't I give Kim a call</i>

427
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,128
<i>and see what she would come up with?</i>

428
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,199
Okay. I can definitely help you
find something.

429
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,135
I know how important
the ESPYs are to Caitlyn,

430
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,572
<i>so, of course, I want
to help her pick out an outfit.</i>

431
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:51,443
I've always said, just make sure
you represent and dress appropriately.

432
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,580
[Caitlyn] <i>The ESPYs, you can do any--
You can go formal, full-length.</i>

433
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,882
<i>Basically, anything that you want to do.</i>

434
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,584
-Okay. I will figure it out.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

435
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,753
<i>Oh! We're working together.</i>

436
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,389
<i>Kim Kardashian, my stylist.</i>

437
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,824
<i>Next time, Khloé, you can do it.</i>

438
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,626
[both] Okay.

439
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,763
I'm a little more ratchet
than… than Kim is.

440
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,166
-[Caitlyn] <i>I love that.</i>
-[both chuckle]

441
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,869
-Okay.
-[Caitlyn chuckles]

442
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,837
[Caitlyn]
<i>All right. I'll talk to you guys later.</i>

443
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,572
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

444
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,640
<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

445
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,008
She has no idea what ratchet is.

446
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,109
-No clue.
-No clue.

447
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,310
[both laugh]

448
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,747
[upbeat music]

449
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,257
{\an8}[Scott] Whoa. Is this like
a whole workout room?

450
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,092
Dude, this place is no joke.

451
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,094
I'm getting buff over here.

452
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,328
[Khloé] I didn't know
you even knew how to do that.

453
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,065
[exhales sharply]
Oh, my god.

454
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,967
I'm gonna be huge
by the time I leave here.

455
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,637
[Scott chuckles]
That toilet doesn't look,

456
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,038
like, super comfy.

457
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,440
-[Khloé] It is.
-[Scott] Is it?

458
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,675
[Khloé] Why are you, like,
going through everything?

459
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,877
<i>Ever since Kourt has left town
with the kids,</i>

460
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,413
Scott has been over quite a bit.

461
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,615
<i>And it's a little stressful.</i>
[chuckles]

462
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,151
-[Scott] Let me ask you a question.
-[Khloé] Mm?

463
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,719
[Scott]
You got to get rid of some of this.

464
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,254
Why don't you throw this bad boy up there?

465
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,157
No, no, because those two go together

466
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,358
-as a piece.
-[Scott] What do you mean?

467
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,827
As a horse and carriage?

468
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,362
-Holy [bleep], this thing is heavy.
-It's real.

469
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,932
[quirky music]

470
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,066
[gasping nervously]

471
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,367
[Khloé gasps]

472
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,936
No, no. No, no. It stands up.

473
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,104
[Scott] Where is it supposed to go?

474
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,338
[Khloé] Stand. Yeah.

475
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,573
[Scott] I just broke
at least a hundred dollars

476
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,074
worth of this thing.

477
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,609
[Khloé] Okay. No, no. I got it.

478
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,611
You, literally, are no help.

479
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,048
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

480
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,250
Nope. No more touching.

481
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,551
[Scott] A lot of fun stuff in here.

482
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,120
Oh, my god.

483
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:44,156
Is this table
not really centered to the TV,

484
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,357
or it's centered to the wall?

485
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,327
Centered to the [bleep] thing,
I don't know!

486
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,262
It's centered to something!
What the [bleep]?

487
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,831
[Khloé] I can't handle this right now!
Seriously, what else

488
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,133
-is wrong with this room?
-Wait. Let me just…

489
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,334
-let me just fix it.
-No. For what?

490
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,136
Here's the [bleep] edge.

491
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,203
-What the [bleep] do you want me to do?
-Okay, okay.

492
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,339
All right, here. How about this?
How about you look down

493
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,773
and take a look at the speakers?

494
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,075
-No. I don't give…
-And then look at that side,

495
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,110
-and then look at that side.
-…a [bleep]. I've been fine here

496
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,078
-for how long?
-[Scott] That speakers half-closed

497
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,446
-and that's not.
-[bleep] that

498
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,381
because you're [bleep] stressing me out.

499
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,283
-So, no. We're not doing that anymore.
-I'd be stressed out too,

500
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,551
if my table was sideways.

501
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,953
I love Scott,
and I want to be there for him,

502
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,421
and I want to support him,

503
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,390
but he has got to stop touching
my [bleep].

504
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:21,760
Because I just want to kill him.
Like, I am too OCD for this.

505
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,196
Clearly, he has no idea
what to do with his time.

506
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,664
[Khloé] You have got to get out.

507
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,634
{\an8}[upbeat music]

508
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,142
{\an8}Is this a hairless peach?

509
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,178
[Scott] You're asking me
if that's a hairless peach?

510
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,979
What do you think I'm gonna think about?

511
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,915
This one went and got a Brazilian.

512
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,583
This is obviously a nectarine.

513
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,118
How the [bleep]
was I supposed to know that?

514
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,219
-What's the difference?
-Obviously, you're not

515
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,521
-a fruit specialist.
-Wait, I've got a-- Oh, my god.

516
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,223
-You're gonna Google a nectarine?
-[phone chimes]

517
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,859
Nectarine versus peaches.

518
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,396
[Khloé] "A peach and a nectarine are
very similar.

519
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,464
Genetically, there's not much difference
between the two.

520
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,799
-The main difference is that…
-[Scott] One's hairless?

521
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,069
a peach has fuzz on its skin,
while a nectarine does not."

522
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,337
-I'm not an idiot.
-[Khloé] Oh, wait, "Nectarines are

523
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,272
a bit more likely
to be affected by diseases,

524
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,175
-such as brown rot and bacterial spots."
-[Scott] The nectarine?

525
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,310
Well, it's 'cause it's got no bush.

526
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,212
-Right. There's nothing to protect it.
-Right.

527
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,346
You wonder why in the '80s

528
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,215
the girls weren't getting STDs
like they were today.

529
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,182
[Khloé chuckles]

530
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,118
You know, this is gonna be, like,
the longest I'm away from the kids

531
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,954
and Kourt, ever.

532
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,989
[Khloé] How do you feel?

533
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,090
Oh, I'm kind of anxious.

534
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,960
[Scott]
I'm supposed to do some appearances.

535
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,062
I just feel like I, like,
want to book my time,

536
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,863
so like, I don't think
about missing the kids and Kourtney.

537
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,065
-But at the same time--
-[Khloé] But are you gonna be

538
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,299
on your best behavior?

539
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,402
-Worse!
-Oh, my god. You probably are.

540
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,972
Well, I mean, it's hard to be
on amazing behavior

541
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,907
when you're at a nightclub or at a party.

542
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,510
Just make sure you're doing
whatever you think is best.

543
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,580
Well, I usually would do it strictly
because of money.

544
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,581
-[Khloé] Right. So, do you…
-'Cause I like money.

545
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,016
…need the money?

546
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,752
I could probably make money
other ways that are healthier.

547
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,220
Why don't you try that first?

548
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,991
You could go into your hobby
of flipping houses.

549
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,661
I could work on my houses.
I'm still gonna miss the kids.

550
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,896
I just feel like if I went to Europe
and I did some parties,

551
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,565
I probably would totally not think
about anything.

552
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,601
[Khloé] <i>Kourt and the kids have been gone
about a week now.</i>

553
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,737
In the past, when Scott had downtime,

554
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,939
he would book parties
and club appearances,

555
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,508
and nothing good ever came out of that.

556
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,777
So for him to even be thinking

557
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,880
of booking a club appearance again
really has me worried.

558
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,050
Think it through, and don't just do it
'cause you're bored.

559
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,721
[upbeat music]

560
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,059
{\an8}[Kim] That one's, like, a little too big.

561
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,895
-I don't think you'd want to go that size.
-Which one?

562
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,231
-This one or this one?
-[Kim] Let me see them both.

563
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,568
This one feels heavier,
but the shape might be better.

564
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,873
The one on the left looks, like, bigger.

565
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,144
[Kim] That's all you've ever wanted,
is cleavage.

566
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,446
Look at that. That's amazing.

567
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,316
-That's, like, huge.
-[Khloé] That's amazing, right?

568
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,817
You would never go that big, would you?

569
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,886
-You talkin' to me?
-[Kim] I don't think they look bad.

570
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,854
[Khloé]
I totally look like an Instagram whore.

571
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,524
Whore. Boring.

572
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,959
It really is a tougher way to live.

573
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,828
Oh, my god, I'm finally you.

574
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,196
[gasps]

575
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,165
Oh, my god.

576
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,936
[Kim] <i>I mean, Khloé looks beautiful
no matter what.</i>

577
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,471
I love small boobs,

578
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,373
but, like, I've always had big boobs.

579
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,775
I think Khloé doesn't get
how hard it is to workout

580
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,677
when you really have, like, big boobs,

581
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,846
<i>like, bouncing around everywhere.</i>

582
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,614
<i>So I wanted to work out with Khloé</i>

583
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,883
so that she can really test out
her bigger boobs.

584
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,085
[Don] How's everybody's body feeling?

585
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,753
{\an8}-[Khloé] Fabulous.
-[Kim] Really tired.

586
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,455
All right, what are we doing today?

587
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,490
[Don] Let's start here
on the ball for the warm-up.

588
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,158
You just get some blood flow right now.

589
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,294
Pull it, knee up, drop.

590
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,196
Good. Two up. Three up.

591
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,732
{\an8}Look at how big my boobs…

592
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,102
Do a little jump up this time.
Up, two, up. Good.

593
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,838
I've always wanted, like,
cleavage in a sports bra.

594
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,773
Like, I love those girls at the gym

595
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,408
<i>that just got big ol' boobs.</i>

596
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,876
<i>And I never really have that.</i>

597
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:01,246
So, I'm digging
this whole cleavage-in-a-sports-bra thing.

598
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,347
-[Don] Nine, eight…
-[Kim] Oh, my god, you're way heavier

599
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,615
than usual.

600
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,616
-[Don] …seven, six…
-Shut up.

601
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,817
-[Kim] You do.
-[Don] …five…

602
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,053
I do feel like the boobs pass the test.

603
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,023
So, I don't feel like it hurts
to go get a consultation,

604
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,626
see what my options are,
and just to see, like,

605
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:18,130
how serious I am
about this whole boob job thing.

606
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,865
I mean, we're in LA.

607
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:23,402
I feel like people get their boobs done
like they fill up a car with gas.

608
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,104
-[Khloé] Don, thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

609
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,473
[Kim]
So how was it? Really different, right?

610
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,244
No, not that different,
but, you know… we'll see.

611
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,312
[upbeat music]

612
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,088
-[Tomer] Just want to walk through it?
-[Scott] Yes, let's just go through it.

613
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,223
{\an8}This has head-on city light views,

614
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,392
{\an8}it's got about a 180-degree view.

615
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,927
[Tomer] It's a mid-century house.

616
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,595
They've owned it for about 52 years.

617
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,465
You've got really high ceilings in here.
I mean, once they get everything out,

618
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,866
you'll be able to see, but…

619
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,669
-Yeah, the views are crazy.
-[Scott] This is nice out here.

620
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:59,504
<i>The view and the land
and how private it is</i>

621
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,173
<i>and the private street is what makes it.</i>

622
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,842
I'm happy that Khloé gave me
that little push

623
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,211
just to remember that I got to work,

624
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,779
<i>instead of doing all these club gigs,</i>

625
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,215
<i>because it's not the best thing
in the world for me.</i>

626
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,550
[Scott] Big pool, big view.

627
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,285
And you'd have a whole yard here.

628
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,353
And then all this just needs to be redone.

629
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,289
Everything needs to slide.

630
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,990
It has potential.

631
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,993
I think in the past,
it was very difficult for me

632
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,929
to be positive with my time

633
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,831
<i>if I wasn't spending time with my kids.</i>

634
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,500
But now I realize that they are
the most important thing in my life.

635
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,569
And there's gonna
be times when they're gone,

636
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,805
and I'm gonna need to fill my time
with positive things.

637
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,141
-[Khloé] How are you feeling?
-[Scott] I feel good. I mean,

638
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,342
I miss the kids, and I miss Kourtney,

639
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,044
but I feel good.

640
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,412
As long as I'm thinking about work

641
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,315
and, like, you know,
pounding the pavement…

642
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,783
-Pounding the pavement.
-…I feel fine and I'm happy.

643
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,251
And I love houses, and I love decorating,

644
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,353
so it's, like, I'm excited,
and it's a lot better

645
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,454
than sitting in a nightclub all night.

646
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,789
[Khloé] Yeah, it's like a whole--

647
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,324
-it's a whole shebang.
-It's a whole shabooble.

648
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,326
-[Khloé] Shabooble.
-This is just like a booba-aloosk.

649
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,360

{\an8}-[Caitlyn] Look who it is.
-[Kim] Hello.

00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,139
{\an8}My little girl.

00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,374
-How are you doing?
-Hi.

654
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,709
-How are you doing?
-[Caitlyn] I appreciate,

655
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,445
{\an8}Michael, you coming through
in very short notice.

656
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,779
{\an8}-It was only what?
-[Kim] That's what Michael does,

657
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,747
{\an8}-you know?
-A week and…

658
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,148
-[Caitlyn] That's what he does.
-So, let's, um…

659
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,817
-let's get started.
-[Caitlyn] Yeah.

660
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:19,951
I say we try some clothes on.

661
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,454
[Kim] <i>Tonight is the night of the ESPYs</i>

662
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,489
so Michael Costello and I
are gonna go through

663
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,258
all of the outfits with Caitlyn

664
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,693
just to make sure
that she has the perfect look

665
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,129
and we get her out the door
looking amazing.

666
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,631
-[Caitlyn] Are you ready?
-[Michael] We're ready.

667
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,099
[Kim] Should we let Snapchatters

668
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:37,002
-pick your outfit?
-All right, now this is a very Kim dress.

669
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,436
This is what I would call this,

670
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,538
-a Kim…
-Yes!

671
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,273
-[Michael] Well?
-[Kim] Should we Snapchat?

672
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,742
Yeah, I just don't have
the Snapchat thing going.

673
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:44,876
[Kim] Yeah. I could do it.

674
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:46,811
Let me shoot it
and then see if we like it.

675
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,280
-[man] See what it looks like.
-[Kim] Turn around

676
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,814
and we'll make the train perfect.

677
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,417
At the count of three,
start walking into the room.

678
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,953
One, two, three. Go.

679
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:58,690
This could be an option.

680
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,959
[Michael] You'll like this one,

681
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,561
the white one that she's gonna try on.

682
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:03,628
[Caitlyn] Are you ready?

683
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:04,763
-[Michael] I'm ready.
-[Kim] Yes.

684
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:09,100
[Caitlyn vocalizing]

685
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,201
[Kim] Wow!

686
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,470
-Go for this.
-[Caitlyn] I know you like the black one.

687
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,373
[Kim] Wear whatever makes you feel
the most comfortable…

688
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,408
-I feel comfortable.
-[Kim] …and the prettiest.

689
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:17,876
Yeah. I like this.

690
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,644
[Kim] Sorry to be annoying,
but do you have underwear on?

691
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,746
'Cause you see the underwear.
Oh, you need that.

692
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,782
-[Caitlyn] What?
-No, it's fine if you need it.

693
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,116
-I was just saying--
-[Caitlyn] Yeah, I know.

694
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,152
-We can play with that.
-I was just saying, that line.

695
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,720
Just cut a little bit in the back

696
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,655
or a little bit on the sides
just to not, like, dig in.

697
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,290
[Caitlyn]
No, I can wear different ones. All right.

698
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,625
Let me take these off.

699
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,760
[Kim] And what shoes
are you planning on wearing?

700
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,696
Well, I'm gonna wear these just because…

701
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,799
-I don't have any…
-[Kim] Why? No.

702
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,801
-Let me look.
-I don't have any that are…

703
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,269
-[Kim] Let me look.
-I got to be walking around

704
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,972
-so much, these are comfortable.
-[Kim] Well, this is an awards show.

705
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,074
You have to step it up.
Comfortable is for daytime.

706
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,643
This is like <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>.

707
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,278
Just try one on each foot.

708
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,880
[Kim] Why do you own them
if you won't wear them?

709
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,117
This is the event.
This is the time you're gonna wear them.

710
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,385
Roll your eyes.

711
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,020
[Michael] Did you show Kim the jewelry?

712
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,188
{\an8}[Caitlyn]

713
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,156
-I'm wearing it.
-No, we're not doing the ring.

714
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,291
Oh. No ring?

715
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,892
-[Kim] No ring.
-What if I wear the ring on this side?

716
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,661
-[Kim] You're over-accessorizing.
-[Ronda] No. This and that.

717
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,696
-Over-accessorizing. Okay.
-[Kim] Yeah. Yeah.

718
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,934
Caitlyn is just not used to really putting
whole looks together all the time.

719
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,070
Or maybe she's so excited
that she finally has

720
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,773
<i> the chance to wear
every accessory under the sun.</i>

721
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,642
But she needs to, like, tone it down.

722
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,076
[Caitlyn] The final look.

723
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,911
Are you ready?

724
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,580
-[Kim] Yes!
-[Michael] Yay!

725
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,916
-[Caitlyn vocalizes]
-[Michael whistles]

726
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,051
-[laughter]
-Get that off.

727
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,886
[Caitlyn] Don't you like the crown?

728
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,855
-[Kim] I love it.
-[Michael] I love it.

729
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,657
-[Ronda] Oh.
-All right, let's take it off. I know.

730
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,025
It was so good too.

731
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,160
-[Kim] Gorgeous.
-Thank you, babe.

732
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,895
I still don't cosign the shoes.

733
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,697
-It's gonna be okay.
-[Michael] Beautiful.

734
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,499
-[Caitlyn] Are we ready?
-[Ronda] We're ready.

735
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,468
Let's do the ESPYs.

736
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,037
-[Caitlyn] Bye.
-[Ronda] Bye.

737
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,005
[upbeat music]

738
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,344
[Kevin] This is, like, double hotness.

739
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,645
{\an8}-How are you?
-I feel like I died and went to heaven.

740
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,113
{\an8}[Malika] It's your lucky day.

741
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,782
Do you want to go in
and not stand in the doorway?

742
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,816
[Kevin] Um, yeah.

743
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,418
{\an8}[Malika] I'm the dental assistant.

744
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,953
[Kevin] Well, I can see
you've been very active lately.

745
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,289
[laughter]

746
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,391
Wait. You can tell that
through someone's teeth?

747
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,427
-[Khloé] Uh-uh.
-[Kevin] Um, yeah.

748
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,828
What's this little hair right here?

749
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,697
{\an8}-[Khloé] Uh…
-[laughter]

750
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,899
[Kevin]
Okay, I'm gonna send in the cleaner.

751
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,400
-McGolly?
-Send in the…

752
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,635
Send in the cleaner.

753
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,136
[phone chimes]

754
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,973
Oh. Wait. Look what my mom sent me.

755
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,508
She's so pissed that, like, Kim

756
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,944
was dressing Caitlyn for the ESPYs.

757
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,579
Like, she's, like, really upset about it.

758
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,849
-Are you kidding? "Not loyal."
-[Khloé] No. Read hashtag.

759
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,784
"Hashtag not loyal."

760
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,353
[Malika]
"Mom, do not write to me in hashtags."

761
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,789
-[laughs]
-I was literally, like,

762
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,157
-"Who texts this?"
-Okay, you're such a jerk

763
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,193
for not addressing the real problem.

764
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,661
The first thing you say is, "Mom

765
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,296
-don't talk to me in hashtags"?
-Well, 'cause it makes her…

766
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,364
sound like she's, like, kidding.

767
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,867
No, she's not kidding. She's… she's…

768
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,670
she's being sarcastic, but she's pissed,

769
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,371
with all these question marks.

770
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,408
I know, but she ruins it
with the hashtags.

771
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,110
It's not out of character of my mom

772
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,512
to, like, go on a rant via text.

773
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,747
I feel like we all do that.

774
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:12,884
<i>But I can't really understand
her tone right now,</i>

775
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,120
and I don't fully understand…

776
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,188
[chuckles]
…why she's so angry

777
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,890
and why we're speaking in hashtags.

778
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,092
I don't know what to say.
I just feel like I need to, now tell Kim.

779
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,395
I mean, if she's kind of spiraling,
like, you should talk to her.

780
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,731
No. I'll talk to her.
I don't have a problem with that at all.

781
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,800
I just want to tell Kim, you know,

782
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,436
"Mom's really upset with you.
Like, Mom's pissed."

783
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,938
I don't think Kim has any idea.

784
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:38,209
[in sing-song tone]
Ooh… trouble.

785
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,280
{\an8}[cheerful music]

786
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,921
{\an8}[Jonathan] Those daggers are crazy.

787
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:50,989
-And they're shorter right now.
-Is this the sharpest

788
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,223
-they've ever been?
-If you had a baby,

789
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,558
you wouldn't be able to have those.

790
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,460
-[Kim] You can't wipe.
-Do you know the things I do?

791
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,594
I give massages,

792
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,662
-I do everything.
-[Jonathan] With this?

793
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,730
-Yeah.
-You could scramble

794
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,864
eggs and stuff. You're like,

795
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,266
-"Hold on…"
-Let me see.

796
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,668
-[Khloé] I could still massage you.
-[Kim] Ooh. Wait, but they're spiky.

797
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,037
-Like, they're hard.
-It's 'cause it's the first day.

798
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,305
-Yeah.
-[Khloé] Wait.

799
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,441
So, Mom is, like, fuming with you.

800
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,543
Wait. Why?

801
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,812
[Khloé] She was texting me with hashtags.

802
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,513
She was "hashtag disloyal."

803
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,915
Hashtag… And I said,

804
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,449
"Please don't text me with hashtags."

805
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,784
[Jonathan]
That's the weirdest thing I've ever heard.

806
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,653
She thinks you're a traitor,
and she thinks that you…

807
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,589
[chuckles]
…went against the family with Caitlyn.

808
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,024
[dramatic music]

809
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,559
[Khloé] She's pissed.

810
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,860
-[Jonathan] Want to call her?
-Yeah.

811
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,930
[line ringing]

812
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,498
[Jonathan] I cannot believe this.

813
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,433
[Khloé]
She's pissed. She was, like, really upset.

814
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,635
{\an8}-[Kris] <i>What are you doing?</i>
-Mom, it's Khloé.

815
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,038
{\an8}-Are you okay?
-[Kris] <i>Yeah.</i>

816
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,240
Wait. Why are you pissed off at me?

817
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,276
-Hashtag pissed.
-Oh, hashtag disloyal.

818
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,445
-[Kris] <i>Kim?</i>
-What?

819
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,614
<i>You are a </i>[bleep] <i>traitor</i>

820
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,050
<i>that you would have the nerve</i>

821
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:56,421
<i>to go to help Caitlyn to pick a gown.</i>

822
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,789
<i>Like, what is going on?</i>

823
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,526
[Kim] She said, "Fashion emergency.
I have nothing to wear."

824
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,594
<i>Okay, here's the problem.</i>

825
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,198
<i>Why do you need to show up to help…</i>

826
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,601
But last time I heard,
you guys are all good.

827
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,035
<i>That's what you don't get.</i>

828
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,137
<i>I don't say anything to you</i>

829
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:17,141
<i>until I feel abandoned.</i>

830
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,777
<i>And that right now, I'm feeling abandoned.</i>

831
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,679
Mom, I would never abandon you.

832
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,015
-If I even knew that you really thought--
-[Kris] <i>But you've abandoned me.</i>

833
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,884
<i>You have taken somebody else and said,</i>

834
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,419
<i>"Okay, her feelings don't matter.</i>

835
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,288
<i>Everything that…"</i>

836
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,489
-I truly didn't think…
-<i>You know what?</i>

837
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,358
-…that you would care.
-<i>I can't teach you…</i>

838
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:37,328
I'm just gonna try to stay neutral
and not get involved.

839
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,530
<i>I don't want you to be neutral.</i>

840
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,635
[voice breaking]
<i>From my children that I gave birth to,</i>

841
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,404
<i>I want loyalty.</i>

842
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,007
<i>I don't want [bleep] neutral.</i>

843
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,477
Oh, she's really upset.

844
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,413
[Kris] <i>Neutral isn't what I signed up for.</i>

845
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,849
[in normal voice]
<i>That's what you don't get.</i>

846
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,621
<i>I'm trying to be as gracious as I can.</i>

847
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,926
<i>I'm trying to be
as understanding as I can.</i>

848
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,694
<i>I'm betrayed.</i>

849
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,765
<i>I've been [bleep] over on so many levels</i>

850
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,833
<i>that your head would spin.</i>

851
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,469
[Kim] Okay, Mom--

852
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,438
-[Kris] <i>I'm not going to…</i>
-Oh, my god.

853
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:24,542
<i>…[bleep] play this game anymore, okay?</i>

854
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,746
We're all shocked. Like, I had--

855
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,149
Truly, like, I had no idea
she was this upset.

856
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,786
I would never intentionally do anything
to hurt her like this.

857
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,890
[Kris] <i>I would lay in front of a bullet
for any one of you.</i>

858
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,960
Kim totally hears you out,
and I think, moving forward,

859
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,163
it'll be really different.
But I don't think, like,

860
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,432
we ever heard this extreme of it.

861
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,468
[Kris] <i>I never would put that out there.
So I say nothing.</i>

862
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,738
<i>Because I don't want you to be conflicted.</i>

863
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,006
<i>But enough is enough.</i>

864
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,975

{\an8}[Kim] Hi, guys.

867
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,555
[Jonathan]
Oh, what's up? What are you doin'?

868
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,458
-What? 'Cause I have sunglasses?
-[Khloé] No, you look beautiful.

869
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,560
-Can I use this?
-I was with Malika

870
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,562
at the dentist when mom was texting me

871
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:18,963
all that crazy stuff.

872
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,865
-Oh, you were?
-[Jonathan] We got

873
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,700
-the aftermath.
-Like, she was like…

874
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,535
[Kim]
Like, screaming at the top of her lungs.

875
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,104
I was trying to keep the peace.

876
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,172
I… I didn't think it was a big deal.

877
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,640
I really didn't know there was, like…

878
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,476
I didn't know she really felt that way.

879
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,910
[Khloé] Have you spoken to her since?

880
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,178
No.

881
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,446
[Kim] <i>The ESPYs was</i>

882
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,582
Caitlyn's first public appearance
last year.

883

<i>I didn't really consider
that it might still be</i>

884
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,320
<i>a really sensitive subject for my mom</i>

885
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,323
and bring up these emotions
and it would be this painful.

886
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,492
<i>She always tries to do a really good job</i>

887
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,227
at not bringing drama to us,

888
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,662
<i>especially if it's, like,
in her personal life.</i>

889
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:55,066
I totally feel so guilty. I feel so bad.

890
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,702
Like, I obviously want, like,

891
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,571
Mom to know that she's, like,
my number one.

892
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,907
Like, I just want to take her out
for a fun day

893
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,308
or, like, something that she would, like,

894
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,543
actually think is, like, fun.

895
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,611
[Jonathan] Right.

[cheerful music]

[Khloé] Hi.

898
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:15,887
[Dr. Fisher] Good to see you again.

899
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,121
{\an8}Nice to see you.

900
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,322
{\an8}-[Kim] Hi.
-How are you?

901
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,658
{\an8}-Good. How are you?
-Good to see you also.

902
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,193
-Wow.
-Doesn't Kim look so business?

903
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,163
I look so whorish
and Kim looks so business.

904
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,098
I should wear those with my black outfit.

905
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,599
[Dr. Fisher] You know,
I could really get some attention.

906
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,334
-You could borrow mine.
-[Dr. Fisher chuckles]

907
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,036
Okay, let's go look at some tits.

908
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,906
-Okay. Are we going? Okay.
-Easy as that.

909
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,240
[Khloé] <i>I set up a consultation</i>

910
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,110
with Garth Fisher, who is a family friend.

911
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,747
Also, I think, like,
the king of boob jobs.

912
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,316
<i>He's literally done
hundreds of thousands of boobs</i>

913
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:47,151
and just knows what he's doing.

914
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,920
[Dr. Fisher] Let me grab a few implants.

915
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:51,823
[Khloé] Garth, where are the good boobs?

916
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,257
-Okay, there are the good boobs.
-[Dr. Fisher] These are…

917
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:54,992
Okay. The ones--

918
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,261
Those are before
and after reconstruction cases.

919
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,997
[Khloé] I think I love the fullness of--
And, like, these don't look

920
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,032
-super fake to me.
-Right.

921
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,302
[Dr. Fisher] I think you're probably
gonna be around, you know, 350.

922
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,470
-Something like that.
-[Khloé] Okay.

923
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,672
-And that's, like, a "C"? Okay.
-Yeah. Full "C."

924
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,308
Kimberly likes the size of my boobs.

925
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,043
I just wish I had more cleavage.

926
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,511
[Dr. Fisher]
There's different styles of implants.

927
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,012
It just depends on what you want to do.

928
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,013
-I don't like the, too…
-Yeah.

929
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,284
…like, Playmate. Like, I don't like
really, like, circular boobs.

930
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,352
-[Dr. Fisher] Okay.
-I like-- I know you do,

931
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,521
like, the best, like, natural shape.

932
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,723
I want them to look natural.
I don't want them, you know?

933
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,158
Some boobs look hard.

934
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,594
-Yeah, I can make 'em look--
-[Kim] Like, two tennis balls.

935
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,862
-Like, that's the worst.
-[Dr. Fisher] Right.

936
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,964
Like, how can you guarantee that,

937
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,532
like, they're not gonna be hard?

938
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,267
You can never guarantee that.

939
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,237
What happens when you put this
in your body,

940
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,673
your body forms scar tissue around it
because it's a foreign object.

941
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,809
And everybody gets that in the world,

942
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,144
-no matter where you go.
-Mm-hm.

943
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,912
It's something that's kind
of a nuisance, annoying,

944
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,148
and sometimes,
you know, painful, sometimes.

945
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,516
So we hope it doesn't happen, but…

946
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,850
Okay.

947
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,953
[Khloé] How long is the recovery process?

948
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,155
Like, when can I work out again?

949
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,389
You should wait a month.

950
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,791
Because you don't want
to increase the risk

951
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,393
of having scar tissue forming in there.

952
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,229
[Dr. Fisher] Because you're gonna have
a raw surface inside.

953
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,199
Ugh, it's so hard.
Like, I really don't know.

954
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,002
<i>Do I think I would like my boobs bigger?</i>

955
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,405
Yeah. It's just
the seriousness of a surgery.

956
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,773
So I don't know.

957
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,375

962

Wow.

963
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,299
[Kim] Have you thought
any more about the procedure?

964
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,602
So, like, before I went to Garth's, Kim,

965
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,170
it didn't seem, like, that scary

966
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,271
-of a deal to me.
-[Kim] Yeah.

967
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,006
I mean, he says himself, he's like,

968
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,642
"I can't guarantee you won't,
like, capsulate."

969
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,277
No doctor can guarantee that.

970
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:58,249
He was like, "We have a 95% rate
that that hasn't happened."

971
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,350
I know, but…

972
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,685
[Khloé] But I'm not in a rush.

973
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:01,686
I still want to think about it,

974
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,287
-marinate with it, and just see.
-[Kim] Yeah.

975
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,488
Like, I'm not in a rush to do it.

976
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,723
Yeah.

977
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,792
For me, I do want my boobs done,

978
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,694
in the sense that I want bigger boobs.

980
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,098
<i>I'm gonna be changing a part of my body,</i>

00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,400
<i>and I need to make sure I'm planning</i>

982
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,337
<i>for healing time and downtime
and not just rush into something.</i>

983
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,339
It's not that I'm never gonna get
my boobs done.

984
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,474
I'm just… not getting them,

985

990
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,996
What a gorgeous, beautiful view.

991
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,099
The view's crazy
from, like, every direction.

992
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,268
[Kim] <i>I do feel bad
that I hurt my mom's feelings.</i>

993
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,570
<i>So Khloé and I set up this whole…</i>

994
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,572
fun Beverly Hills day for my mom.

995
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,907
[Kris]
This is definitely the <i>Pretty Woman</i> suite.

996
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,844
My mom loves <i>Pretty Woman</i>,
and the Regent Beverly Wilshire is

997
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,679
the hotel that they filmed it in.

998
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,681
<i>We're all gonna have lunch in the suite</i>

999
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,650
that was their main suite in the movie.

1000
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,619
<i>And I just want her to know
we support her no matter what.</i>

1001
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:10,988
This is a dream.

1002
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,090
You guys, this is so fun.

1003
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,026
-[Kim] Thank you so much.
-[Khloé] Ooh, yummy!

1004
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,827
Don't you love this hotel suite?

1005
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:17,928
[Kris] Yes.

1006
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,431
We wanted you to have a fun, pampered day,

1007
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:24,168
as like, an apology
for upsetting you so much

1008
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,037
with, like, me dressing Caitlyn.

1009
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,071
[chuckles softly]

1010
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,240
I mean, I would just never want you
to feel betrayed,

1011
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,541
like, by your own daughter.

1012
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,678
I obviously didn't know,
you know, how serious it was.

1013
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:37,648
You always act so strong
and that it just never bothers you, so…

1014
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,455
I mean, I would just never want you
to feel betrayed,

1015
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,756
like, by your own daughter.

1016
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,926
I obviously didn't know,
you know, how serious it was.

1017
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,463
You always act so strong
and that it just never bothers you, so…

1018
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,500
I felt really bad
about getting so angry at you.

1019
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,536
-I really did.
-[Khloé] Why? You should be honest.

1020
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:02,106
[Kris] It took me by surprise.
Even my emotion surprised me.

1021
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,240
I don't know. I think…

1022
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:06,544
just if I had known, I think
I would've had time to…

1023
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,978
-absorb that.
-Mm-hm.

1024
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,181
[Kris] Because sometimes
that stuff's hard for me.

1025
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:15,886
I don't even have anybody to talk to
that's been through anything similar.

1026
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,255
You know how you guys can talk
to your girlfriends?

1027
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,590
But as a wife

1028
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,058
who was with somebody for all that time,

1029
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,694
that's a lot of memories
and a lot of years

1030
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,530
and a lot of Christmas Eves
and a lot of Father's Day

1031
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,165
and Mother's Day and Easters and…

1032
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:31,335
[Kris] So, I don't really think about it
day to day.

1033
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,771
But for some reason, that hit me,

1034
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,407
I guess, just the wrong way, like, crazy.

1035
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:43,247
[Kris] <i>Going through this whole process
with Caitlyn has been challenging.</i>

1036
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,216
I've always wanted to be there for my kids

1037
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:49,520
<i>and have kind of pushed my feelings
down below the surface</i>

1038
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,455
so that I don't have to feel anything.

1039
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,924
And that's always been kind of my MO.

1040
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:57,228
And I think that sometimes,
you have to feel

1041
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,598
what's going on inside.
And I just exploded,

1042
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,634
<i>because I finally was feeling</i>

1043
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:07,171
what I needed to feel for so many years.

1044
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,273
And it just all came out in one moment.

1045
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,175
I would never go do something like this

1046
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,811
in the middle of the day.
So this is really fun.

1047
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,079
[Khloé] This is so cute.

1048
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,748
Kim wanted you to experience
your favorite movie

1049
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,018
and feel like you're Julia Roberts
and she's Richard Gere.

1050
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,088
[Kris] I think we should go boot shopping
in honor of Julia.

1051
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,556
WWJD?

1052
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,024
-[Kris] Yeah. Yeah.
-What Would Julia Do?

1053
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:27,925
[Kris] What Would Julia Do?

1054
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,094
[Kris and Kim laugh]

1055
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,029
[upbeat music]

1056
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,567
[Kris] Ooh.

1057
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,470
-[Kris] Hi. How are you?
-[woman] How are you, ladies?

1058
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,941
[Kris] This store is so beautiful.

1059
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,144
What is this?

1060
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,814
-To die. It's a jumpsuit.
-Yeah, it's pretty fab.

1061
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,117
-Wow.
-[Kim] I love those little velvet shoes.

1062
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,385
You don't love those, like,

1063
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,353
-the little velvet?
-[Kris] I do. I do.

1064
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,988
-Do you have an eight and a half?
-[woman] Eight and a half?

1065
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,323
In the velvet shoes?

1066
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,425
[Kris] You guys are the best.

1067
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,726
Thank you.

1068
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,062
Mm…

1069
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,630
-Yeah.
-[Kris] Thank you, Khlo.

1070
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,366
{\an8}[crowd cheering]

1071
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,869
[Kris] Hi, guys!

1072
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,371
[cheering continues]

1073
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,473
[man] You're the best mom ever.

1074
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,575
-Thank you.
-She is.

[Kim] <i>Next on</i>
Keeping Up with the Kardashians…

1076
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,379
We won!

1077
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:23,814
[Kris] Look what I found.

1078
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,716
We miss Scott being the Lord.

1079
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,052
I never knew
you guys wanted the Lord back so bad.

1080
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,621
[Khloé] You are now Duke Disick.

1081
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,857
What's going on with my brother?

1082
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,559
He just deleted
all of the pictures of Chyna.

1083
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,861
[Khloé] He hasn't spoken to her in days.

1084
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,362
-[Kourtney] Why?
-How dare you leave a preg--

1085
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,065
I don't give a [bleep].
You still need to check on her.

1086
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,434
Rob, why did you disappear?
