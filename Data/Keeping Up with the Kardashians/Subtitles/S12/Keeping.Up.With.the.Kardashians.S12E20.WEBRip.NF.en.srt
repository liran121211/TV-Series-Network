[Snoop Dogg] So, Khloé,
the Kardashian empire is gigantic now,

31
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:09,602
and it's loving and it's fun, it's happy
and it's all ages and sizes and colors.

You got your baby sisters.

You got your sisters that's right by you.

-For real.

36

And it feels good to see you doing it

37
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,281
because I like to pass it on
to my family. Like…

38
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,083
It's good to keep family in the business

39
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,219
and to be rightful-minded
while you're doing it.

40
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,987
We don't have to argue and fight
and we don't have to agree

41

-to everything that we do or don't like…
-Right.

42
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,890
…but we can always be family.

43
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,159
Yeah. Your son just asked me out
on a date.

44

-No, he didn't.

-He won't tell me his age.

46

-I'm not gonna tell you, either.
-He said, "Steak or crab?"

-[Snoop Dogg] Was he serious?
-Mm-hm.

-[Khloé] Technically not. I birthed it.
-No, no.

No. That's what a surrogate is for.

-Well, I know.
-They're all gonna be together

-I'm gonna have to ask Kanye, seriously.

He already said yes,

99

-I asked him at the birthday party!
-But I think he thought you were joking.

You can't ask him in a party environment
with some drinks…

101

-He wasn't drinking, it was like…
-[Kim] It has to be, like,

-with attorneys and a sit-down.
-…children's party… No.

103
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,528
It has to be, like, a full sit-down.

104

00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,032
I'm so, like, happy to be a part of this.

167
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,367
[Corey] Yeah, Will, good job, man.

168
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,968
-Thanks, man.
-Bye, guys. Thank you.

169
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,969
[Corey] Great job.

170
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,305
[upbeat music]

171
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,014
{\an8}[Faye] Oh, is this silk?

172
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,883
-Yeah.
-I thought it was cotton.

173
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,518
{\an8}-No, silk Dolce.
-[gasps]

174
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,987
{\an8}-Oh, that's even better.
-No, what's even better

175
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,589
-is this art.
-Christ, it's fantastic.

176
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,224
-[Faye] Do you love it?
-[Kris] Faye…

177
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,025
can I just tell you you have

178
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,061
the most amazing taste
in the entire world?

179
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,398
This is something
that's, like, taken to another level.

180
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,999
[Faye] I love this artist.

181
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,368
This reminds me of the wedding.

182
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,104
Oh, my gosh. You got married right there.

183
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,439
-[Faye] I know. Right here.
-Right there.

184
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,941
-[Kris] We'll have that memory forever.
-[Faye] Forever.

185
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,543
-[Kris] Speaking of memories…
-Yes.

186
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,511
I had the best idea.

187
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:56,949
I want to have a videographer
interview my mom

188
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,753
and have her spell out her whole life.

189
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,754
-Like…
-That is the best.

190
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,990
[Kris]
"What was your first childhood memory?"

191
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,426
And what she misses,
and what she would do over again,

192
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:07,927
or does she have regrets, and just…

193
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,796
-[Faye] Love it.
-…really talk about her life

194
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,365
and give us a little bit of history
that we can hang on to.

195
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,101
Yes, I think that's a great idea.

196
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,706
My mom is my best friend, and she's lived

197
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,277
a very beautiful, incredible, long life,

198
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:29,182
and has so many interesting stories
about things

199
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:33,119
that I can't possibly begin
to tell my kids,

200
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,987
because I can't remember it all.

201
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,423
-[Faye] When are you gonna do it?
-[Kris] As soon as possible.

202
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,694
I don't wanna ever have
my regret be that I didn't do it.

203
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,764
I've never met a woman
who's so conservative.

204
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,399
Sometimes, when we get into conversations,

205
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,633
do you ever notice she…

206
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,469
-Sometimes she's shocked…
-[chuckles]

207
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,636
-…that we've ever said something…
-[Kris] She's shocked, and then

208
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,305
she'll give you a gummy and say,

209
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,906
-"Eat this, you're gonna love it."
-[chuckles]

210
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,708
-"You're gonna love it."
-[laughs]

[upbeat music]

212
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,218
[Dr. Crane] Hey, Kris.

213
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,118
[Kris] Hi.

214
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,287
{\an8}-Hi, Kim. How are you?
-[Kim] Hi. How are you?

215
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,589
-How are you?
-[Kris] Good to see you.

216
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,924
You both look… you look as young as ever.

217
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,828
Well, I've only known you
since I'm 17 years old, so…

218
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,864
I hear you've been thinking
about pregnancy.

219
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,665
-Yeah.
-[Kris] Do you think

220
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,202
that her body could withstand
another pregnancy?

221
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,505
[Kim] <i>I want to check with my doctor</i>

222
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:28,107
and see how everything's looking…

223
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,444
to see if it's even possible
to get pregnant again.

224
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,312
Here's what I think.

225
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,583
[Dr. Crane]
Your pregnancies, you had toxemia.

226
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,986
-[Kim] Mm-hm.
-[Dr. Crane] You had a retained placenta.

227
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,187
Very traumatic.

228
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,321
-You know.
-Yeah.

229
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,258
We're always worried
about the next serious complication.

230
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,428
I think the potential fear
of the whole situation is legitimate.

231
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,999
You never know that you might not have
the same type of problem

232
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,834
that could be more serious this time.

233
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,102
[tense music]

234
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,271
You're always taking
a little bit of a chance.

235
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,573
-Yeah.
-[Dr. Crane] There are situations

236
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,142
where a retained placenta
could be life and death.

237
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,478
[tense music continues]

238
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,280
You could bleed to death.

239
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,017
{\an8}[upbeat music]

240
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,226
-[Khloé] Oh, hi.
-[Kendall] Hi.

241
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,229
-Oh, we're so…
-Oh, my goodness!

242
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,998
Wow, we coordinated,
and we didn't even have to try.

243
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,533
That's 'cause we're sisters.

244
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,303
-Cute. Yeah.
-[Khloé] Aren't we?

245
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,405
How the hell are you, "happershrand"?

246
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,674
Remember the Black Eyed Peas song,
"Where is the Love?"

247
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,842
-Mm-hm.
-[Kendall] will.i.am remixed it

248
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,379
-and did a whole video to it.
-For what?

249
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,716
So I did… For everything that's happening,
Black Lives Matter, all of that stuff.

250
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,652
It's so sad. It's one thing
after another after another.

251
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,521
It makes me feel like the world is ending.

252
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,389
I don't know if we have more access

253
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,391
to viewing everything, like,
we're just more aware…

254
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,726
-[Kendall] Yeah.
-…of stuff or…

255
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,728
But we've had access to viewing everything

256
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,330
for years now, and it hasn't been

257
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,965
-this bad.
-Yeah, but the older you get,

258
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,299
the more aware you become of things.

259
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,934
-True.
-And like social media wasn't as big

260
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,035
a few years ago.

261
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,170
We should do something.

262
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,806
With our platforms, how many people

263
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,442
we have access to,
it's probably really silly to not.

264
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,411
But, like, what are you
most passionate about?

265
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,613
Is it, like, the gun laws?

266
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,015
Yeah, I mean, I feel like
that's kind of step one, no?

267
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,552
I think gun laws, forever,
have needed to be changed.

268
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,887
Movie theater killings,
all that stuff, that's, all things

269
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,024
-that were preventable, like…
-Yeah, totally.

270
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,060
[Kendall] <i>I'm very passionate
about stricter gun laws.</i>

271
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,497
I've never really made a statement,
but having such a big platform,

272
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,000
I feel obligated to take action now,

273
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,901
especially with everything
that's going on.

274
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,705
It's such a hard thing to try and, like,
change one human being.

275
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,808
You can't go and like, be like,
"I'm gonna change your soul."

276
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,543
-Mm-hm.
-Like, you know what I mean?

277
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,913
It's harder to get a car
than it is to buy a gun,

278
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,616
-which is wild.
-That's so wild.

279
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,818
But I think, like,
it starts with one person.

280
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,020
-One person has to make a change…
-[Kendall] Uh-huh.

281
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,054
-…somewhere…
-Mm-hm.

282
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,958
…and if you could bring awareness
to just one other person, like,

283
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,594
that follows you, or believes in you,
or likes you,

284
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,796
I think that's all you could ask for.

285
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,264
-Yeah.
-[Khloé] But I think if we all

286
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,402
as a family, did one cause
and really brought awareness to it,

287
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,970
I think it will move mountains.

288
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,439
Kim loves that. Like, Kim's always been
really passionate about it,

289
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,575
so I think our next step is maybe
having, like, a little family powwow.

290
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,179
Yeah. Are you supposed to have
one braid popping out?

291
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,581
-I have, like, a few braids.
-[Kendall] Oh.

292
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,784
I thought it was like
part of your, like, extensions,

293
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,686
or something,
that was just, like, coming out.

294
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,954
-Like my weave? No.
-[Kendall] Yeah. Yeah.

303
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,474

-[Kim] Good.

305
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,712
-He's so big.
-[Dr. Huang] Oh, my gosh,

306
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,580
-congratulations.
-[Kim] He weighs almost as much

307
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,515
-as my daughter. He's huge.
-[Dr. Huang] Adorable.

308

-Happy kid.
-He's so cute that I feel like,

309
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,219
oh, my god, I need to have another one.

310
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,620
[Dr. Huang]
Okay, so this is why you're here today?

311
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:02,688
Yeah.

312
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,825
So I didn't get good news from Dr. Crane,

313
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,893
and, you know, it's super disappointing.

314
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,796
<i>I really wanna have another baby,</i>

315
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:15,234
and Dr. Huang is
the best fertility specialist.

316
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,070
<i>So, I just want to get a second opinion</i>

317
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,205
and see what he has to say.

318
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,640
[Dr. Huang]
In my evaluation of your pregnancies,

319
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,609
there's the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.

320
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,144
-Mm-hm.
-[Dr. Huang] Right? So, you know,

321
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,780
we don't want to carry
that same risk of having you

322
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,181
get pregnant, deliver the babies,

323
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,650
then need blood transfusion
or, God forbid,

324
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,687
if we can't stop the bleeding,
uh, do a hysterectomy.

325
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,922
Your first pregnancy,
you had placenta accreta

326
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,290
and preeclampsia.

327
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,126
When you have one pregnancy
with preeclampsia,

328
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,495
it does increase your risk
about 25 to 30 percent

329
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,396
of having a subsequent pregnancy
with preeclampsia.

330
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,599
You getting pregnant again would be
a high-risk pregnancy.

331
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,567
The other option then,
would be to consider

332
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,835
using a gestational surrogate.

333
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,339
You know, if you were trying
to safeguard you,

334
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,875
and being around for these, you know,

335
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,311
kids that you have,
then doing what's safe is the best thing.

336
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,481
Using a surrogate is not
an unreasonable option.

337
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,052
If the two doctors
that I trust have told me

338
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,022
that it would not be safe for me
to get pregnant again,

339
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,959
I have to listen to that,
but because I don't know anyone

340
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,762
that's been a surrogate,
anyone that's used a surrogate,

341
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,732
I didn't really think of that
as an option for me.

342
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,767
[Kim] I don't know. I need…

343
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,102
I just want to, like, weigh my options.

344
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,771
[Dr. Huang] The question is,
how can we do this safely,

345
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,274
because if our goal is to grow your family
like you want to,

346
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,709
then a surrogate makes sense.

347
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,280
[upbeat music]

348
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,756
Well, what are you leaning towards?
Like, do you think

349
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,625
you would be pregnant again
or have a surrogate?

350
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,762
[Kim]
Obviously, I do want to have my own baby.

351
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,064
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-You know?

352
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,800
But I feel like I truly don't know

353
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,336
if my body can handle it one more time.

354
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,741
You should talk to somebody
maybe who's used a surrogate.

355
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,343
Yeah.

356
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,447
Just think of a surrogate
the whole way through.

357
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,451
Somebody, like, would you,
like I would be…

358
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,886
Yeah, like, what are you eating?

359
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,554
-Right.
-What are you this? What are you that?

360
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,227
[Kim] <i>I mean, there's just a lot of fears
that I have about surrogacy</i>

361
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,262
and a lot of, like, unanswered questions.

362
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,064
<i>Like, I just don't have
the information on it.</i>

363
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,199
I don't know how I'm gonna feel about it.

364
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,368
I never have given it that much thought,

365
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,771
that I just… it's something that does…

366
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,274
concern me.

367
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,544
If you use a surrogate,

368
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,613
nobody has to know, the whole time.

369
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,615
You could have a baby for a year,

370
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,450
-and nobody would even know.
-[chuckles]

371
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,252
Not that that's a reason
to have a surrogate,

372
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,387
but if you have to, that is a benefit.

373
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,356
Like, who's in that little stroller?

374
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,457
Yeah.

375
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,560
[soft upbeat music]

376
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,868
{\an8}-[dog barking]
-[Scott] Should we go out here

377
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,303
-with the sun?
-Sure.

378
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,971
I wouldn't mind getting a little rays.

379
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,339
[Khloé] Kind of breezy.

380
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,075
Oh, look who it is!

381
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,078
[Khloé] Oh, my god, you look so pretty!

382
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,347
-What's going on out here?
-[Khloé] Wow.

383
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,083
-Where are you going?
-Just over here to say hi.

384
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,586
-[Khloé] You look so pretty.
-Thank you.

385
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,221
-You look good.
-[Scott] I feel like

386
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,123
you guys get so decked out.

387
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,625
-I'm so decked out right now.
-Me and you don't.

388
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,793
In my Bible shirt…

389
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,396
-[Scott] But I feel like you and Kim…
-…and my flats that I wear every second.

390
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,331
[Kris] So cute. So wait,

391
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,033
I wanted to run something by you guys.

392
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,568
-Let's hear it.
-[Kris] I've been thinking a lot about…

393
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,837
life and my mom.

394
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,773
Wouldn't it be great

395
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,576
if I had somebody interview Mary Jo

396
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,845
about her life on camera

397
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,114
so that we have these amazing memories

398
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,216
about this person that none of us know

399
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,751
as well as we know each other,

400
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,421
because we all grew up together.
We didn't grow up with her

401
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,523
in her life, in her childhood.

402
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,991
[Khloé] That is such a good idea.

403
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,826
[Kris]
I want to ask her if she'd be into it.

404
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,962
She's in San Diego. Call her right now.

405
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,230
-[Khloé] Okay.
-[dog barking]

406
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,299
[line rings]

407
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,867
-[MJ] <i>Hello.</i>
-Hi, MJ.

408
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,102
{\an8}[MJ] <i>Hi.</i>

409
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,971
{\an8}-[Khloé] What are you doing?
-[Scott] Oh, she's the best.

410
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,106
{\an8}<i>I went to lunch
with Frankie, my boyfriend,</i>

411
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,408
-<i>and his wife.</i>
-What?

412
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,277
-[laughs]
-[Khloé] How was your lunch?

413
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,079
-Good?
-Is she a side girl?

414
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,281
My mom wanted
to ask you something, hold on.

415
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,582
Did you just catch that?

416
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,352
-[Khloé] What?
-Hey, Mom, are you a side chick?

417
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,586
[MJ] <i>Am I a what?</i>

418
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,021
[Kris] A side chick.

419
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,623
<i>I don't know these terms.
Yes, I think I'm a side chick.</i>

420
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,524
[Scott] Oh!

421
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,526
<i>He's going to introduce me to the wife. </i>

422
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:38,263
-[laughter]
-Oh, thank God. Lucky you.

423
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,599
-Is she being serious?
-[Kris] She's kidding.

424
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,469
Hey, Mom, I wanted
to run something by you.

425
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,772
Wouldn't it be great if you came up here,

426
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,809
and I got somebody
to ask you questions on camera

427
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,344
and then we would interview you…

428
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,246
No, give this, give this to me,
give this to me.

429
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,681
-[Kris] Never mind.
-[Khloé] Hi, MJ.

430
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,551
-[Scott] I think there's a word for it.
-[MJ] <i>Oh, it's called a legacy, uh, video.</i>

431
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,820
[Khloé]
Yeah, we want a legacy video of you.

432
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,789
<i>Okay, could I have
hair and makeup, please?</i>

433
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,224
-[Khloé] Of course.
-[laughs]

434
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,593
-[Scott] Of course, the best.
-[MJ] <i>I look so horrible.</i>

435
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,595
[Kris] So you're in, Mom, if we set it up?

436
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,663
Yeah, we want a legacy video of you.

437
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,831
Please say yes.

438
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,066
<i>I'll come up when you're ready.</i>

439
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,234
-[Khloé] Yay!
-Okay.

440
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,201
<i>We'll do it.</i>

441
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,369
[Kris and Khloé] All right. Love you.

442
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,438
-[MJ] <i>Love you, bunnies.</i>
-[Khloé] Bye.

443
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,007
Like, the cutest thing in the world.

444
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,043
[Khloé] But why don't you interview her?

445
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,412
You videotape her so you have more like…

446
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,546
of, like, a family feel.

447
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,548
You don't want some stranger
interviewing her.

448
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,618
Well, I'll be there, but I think
I need a professional.

449
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,253
You should interview her.

450
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,554
[Kris] No, I'd rather not.

451
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,759
I don't know why my mom is so against her

452
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,062
being the interviewer for MJ.

453
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,164
I feel like this can't go any other way.

454
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,999
I don't want to hire
some random interviewer

455
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,067
to interview MJ,

456
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,535
'cause I don't think we're gonna get

457
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,538
raw, deep, good stories.

458
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,473
[Scott] I've known her 11 years.

459
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,742
-I could ask from 11.
-[Kris] Your questions.

460
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,344
-Oh, that's a good idea.
-I have my questions already.

461
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,446
[Kris] Okay.

462
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,514
Work on your questions!

463
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,049
It's gonna be a big deal!

464

465
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,928
{\an8}-[Kendall] Who are ya?
-[Rob sighs]

466
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,630
{\an8}[Kendall]
You smell nice. Do you want to see around?

467
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,766
-This is your brand-new home?
-[Kendall] Yes.

468
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,670
So, this is gonna be
the family living room.

469
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,704
-[Rob] Okay.
-[Kendall] I don't know the difference

470
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,106
between a family and living room.

471
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,874
-And then, I'm making a puzzle…
-Oh, nice.

472
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,142
…because I'm really cool.

473
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,544
-[Rob] Oh, <i>Lion King</i> puzzle?
-[Kendall] Yeah.

474
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,012
The guest rooms aren't done.

475
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,814
These are just, like…
this is just [bleep] we had.

476
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,250
Khloé had that bed in storage,
so she just gave it to me.

477
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,985
[Rob] This…
[laughs]

478
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,086
[Kendall] What, it was yours or something?

479
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,387
You can keep-- No, it doesn't--
It doesn't matter.

480
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,989
-[Kendall] What?
-No, what it was…

481
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,058
It was just…
I put it in her storage. It's all good.

482
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,026
-It's brand… It's brand-new.
-[Kendall] Oh. She just gave it to me.

483
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,328
And then…

484
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,463
-this is my favorite part.
-This is a dope ass room.

485
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,698
I call it the boys' room.

486
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:56,201
Yeah, this is where probably
I would be all the time.

487
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,072
What's this?
"Chrissy Teigen leaves Twitter

488
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,007
-after gun…"
-[Kendall] "…control tweet."

489
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,208
Um, Khloé and I were talking,

490
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,544
and I've been looking
for, like, gun control organizations

491
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,879
to get involved with.

492
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:07,779
-[Rob] Yeah.
-'Cause I'm, like,

00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:11,884
we have such a nice platform
to, like, bring awareness to things.

494
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,686
Yeah. Gun control's,
like, a very serious thing

495
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,088
in America, in the world.

496
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,891
But if you get involved
with that type of stuff,

497
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,894
you're definitely gonna,
like, get some backlash.

498
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,596
Be a lot of people that have
completely different views,

499
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,331
that are opposite than you.

500
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,766
So, you're gonna get a lot of hate.

501
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,635
[tense music]

502
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,503
Kim received a lot of backlash

503
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,038
-when she spoke on it.
-Really?

504
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:37,276
Yeah, you're a young, powerful woman,
so you got to…

505
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,213
just be prepared
for the negativity as well.

506
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,414
[Kendall] That's crazy.

507
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,384
"Conservatives are saying
that Matt Damon is a hypocrite

508
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,053
because his character
in a movie carries firearms."

509
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,388
Is that a joke?

510
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,256
People get crazy with anything.

511
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,458
If you say something
that's completely right,

512
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,160
you're still gonna hear
a bunch of [bleep].

513
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,395
I feel like if I get involved,

514
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,730
it's gonna do more damage
than actually help.

515
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,701
[upbeat music]

516
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,411
{\an8}[Kendall] Put your right hand out
like you're gonna shake my hand.

517
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,047
-[Kendall] Wait, wait, wait.
-[Khloé chuckles]

518
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,182
That's so trippy.
Who taught you to do that?

519
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,818
Okay, wait, then another one.
Everyone just curl in.

520
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,286
Keep going, keep going.

521
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,889
[Kim] This deserves a Snapchat.

522
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,525
-Guess the fingers.
-Oh, I think they'll know my fingers.

523
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,893
My nail is so…

524
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,661
[Khloé]
I think they're gonna know my finger.

525
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,497
[Kim] Do you guys know you can change
the color of your letters?

526
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,632
-I had no idea.
-[Kendall] Yeah.

527
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,567
Duh. I don't even know Snapchat.

528
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,302
Dodo bird.

529
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,472
Khloé was telling me
that you really wanted to get involved

530
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,640
-in something.
-[Kendall] Mm-hm.

531
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,344
I was telling her that you do
a lot of stuff for, like,

532
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,946
gun awareness and gun violence.
I was saying we should ask you.

533
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,616
I work with this organization, Everytown…

534
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,085
-[Kendall] Mm-hm.
-…and I set up a lunch

535
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,420
with some gun violence victims.

536
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,657
Some family members
that have been affected

537
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,559
that I think would really love
to meet you guys,

538
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,996
'cause they really do appreciate
people like us speaking out.

539
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:07,165
I've been meeting
with Everytown, an organization that…

540
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,369
<i>is fighting to change
all the gun control laws.</i>

541
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,804
<i>There are so many loopholes in the system,</i>

542
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,673
<i>and I just feel really passionately about…</i>

543
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,109
how our gun control laws have to change.

544
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,711
You guys should meet with them
and see what they're all about

545
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,214
and see if it's something
that fits for you.

546
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,482
[Khloé] I'm down for it.

547
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,520
I wanna do this
and I wanna be a part of it,

548
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,855
but it just makes me nervous,

549
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,057
like, what people are gonna think of it.

550
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,294
You don't know who's gonna, like,
actually be for it and who's not.

551
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,196
That's why a lot of people
don't get involved, I've learned,

552
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,300
is because you do…
you can get a lot of backlash.

553
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,135
[Kendall]
<i>It's kinda difficult, 'cause I know</i>

554
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,636
<i>that we are public figures.</i>

555
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,773
And seeing how controversial it could be

556
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,608
to speak out about something
you're passionate about,

557
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,510
I just think I don't want

558
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,246
<i>the attention of someone not agreeing</i>

559
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,615
with what I'm saying to take away

560
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,318
from the fact
that there's actual gun issues

561
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,252
<i>that need to be handled.</i>

562
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,987
It might bring more harm than good.

563
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,891
I feel like, in life,
I've gotten a lot of backlash

564
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,593
and I've gotten a lot of hate,
so I'm gonna just stick up

565
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,629
for what I believe in and what I want.

566
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,064
It's something that you believe in,

567
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,999
so you have to be confident in it
and go for it.

568
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,768
But at the same time, like… I don't know.

569
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,238
[upbeat music]

570
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,313
{\an8}[Kris] This tan is everything.

571
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,316
Thanks. It's actually a real tan,
for once in my life.

572
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,718
It's very becoming.

573
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,220
I haven't had a real tan
in about three years.

574
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,722
Yeah. Me, neither.

575
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,791
[Khloé] Um, we are…
Do you even know about this,

576
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,860
the legacy video
that we want to shoot with MJ?

577
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,995
-I don't.
-I love that it has a name now.

578
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,797
-It's a legacy video.
-[Khloé] Yeah.

579
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,867
So, Mom wanted to do this video with MJ.

580
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,769
So, I came up with a few questions

581
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,937
-that we could ask.
-Can I see?

582
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,307
Why don't we have
Anderson Cooper be the mediator

583
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,509
and ask MJ all the questions?

584
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,910
[Kris] She would die.

585
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,480
Okay, that's so impersonal,
and MJ will give…

586
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,881
like, she would love that her grandkids

587
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,082
are asking her questions.

588
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,151
-And it's way more sentimental.
-Totally.

589
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,520
And she will be
way more inclined to give, like,

590
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,489
deep, emotional answers,
rather than Anderson.

591
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,890
-Oh, here we go.
-She'll feel guarded,

592
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,259
-and MJ's not…
-Anderson is hot.

593
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,294
[Kris] Like, she loves Anderson.

594
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,230
[Kim]
Why don't you wanna do the interview?

595
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,766
[emotional music]

596
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,101
It just makes me sad.

597
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,270
[Kris] I don't want to cry
through the whole thing, you know,

598
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,039
because it's like
the story of someone's life,

599
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,307
but at the end of their life.

600
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:35,046
I just feel like, I…
I don't know what I will do

601
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,648
when something happens to her.

602
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,085
I'm especially emotional
when it comes to my mom,

603
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:43,021
because I realize
that one day she won't be here.

604
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,158
<i>So, I would rather not be the person</i>

605
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,026
<i>interviewing my mom, because I know</i>

606
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,363
that I'm going to be an emotional wreck.

607
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,133
I think you will regret it later
if you don't.

608
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,371
If you ever watch this,
you're gonna wanna, like,

609
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,973
hear your voice or things
that you really are interested about,

610
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,308
'cause you're gonna have
way different questions

611
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,443
than I have.

612
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,846
-It's okay to share emotion.
-Totally.

613
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,648
I share too much emotion sometimes…

614
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,082
But you don't want
to interview her at all.

615
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,385
I would love to…
You know what, I think is…

616
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,253
just because we're sitting here
discussing it,

617
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,922
now I'm really thinking about it.

618
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,290
I think we should share.

619
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,426
I think if we each took an hour,
it would be a lot easier

620
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,129
and it would give her a change of scenery.

621
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,631
[Kris] <i>I understand what Khloé's saying,</i>

622
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,867
<i>but I don't want to be that emotional.</i>

623
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,103
I think it will be a more meaningful tape

624
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,505
with me doing it,

625
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,842
as long as I can just keep it together.

626
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,480
{\an8}[upbeat music]

627
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,986
{\an8}[Kourtney] I'm redecorating this room.

628
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,022
-I'm keeping those sconces.
-[Kim] Yeah.

629
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,425
The hallway looks
so much cleaner without them.

630
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,494
-[Kim] Way better.
-[Kourtney] But I also want it

631
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,529
to look like a home.
I don't want it to look like…

-[Kim] A monastery?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

633

someone that has used

634
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,170
a surrogate before. Her name's Natalie.

[dramatic music]

636
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,775
I want to talk to someone
that's used a surrogate

637
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,978
that also has carried a child before

638
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,447
so that she would know the difference.

<i>I want to explore every avenue,</i>

640
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,219
just do all the research
that I possibly can

641
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,188
to figure out what all of my options are.

642
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,422
Hi.

643
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,891
-Hi. How are you?
-How are you?

{\an8}-I'm Natalie.
-[Kim] Hi. I'm Kim.

645
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,628
{\an8}-Nice to meet you.
-[Kim] Nice to meet you.

00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,962
-Hi. Kourtney.
-This is my sister.

647
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,831
-[Natalie] Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

648
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,633
[Kim] So you had

649
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,401
-a baby naturally.
-Yes.

650
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,637
And then you used a surrogate
and had twins.

651
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,305
Yeah. I was diagnosed with breast cancer,

652
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,740
and my oldest was six months old,

653
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:45,010
so if I wanted more kids, this was it.

654
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,211
-Yeah.
-[Natalie] And so,

655
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,746
I then had twins via surrogate.

656
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,614
-And were they your egg?
-[Natalie] Yes.

657
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,516
-And your husband's sperm?
-Yeah.

658
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,884
They are my husband's, yeah.

659
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,519
They're genetically ours.

00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,187
Yeah, and do you have a relationship

661
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:57,622
with the surrogate now?

662
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,858
-We don't.
-Was that her first time?

663
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,326
[Natalie] No, it was her third.

664
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,496
Someone has to really understand
what they're taking on,

665
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,599
and if you've done it before,
it makes a huge difference.

666
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,467
I'm more worried that, like,

667
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,937
'cause I gave birth to two,

668
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,672
there's a sense in me that feels like

669
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,007
because I went through all that pain

670
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,077
for these two babies,
like, I know we, like,

671
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,779
did this together. You know what I mean?

672
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:21,780
-[Natalie] Yeah.
-Like, we went

673
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:26,851
through hell and back together.
This little baby was just…

674
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,155
Like, there's no one
that would feel your love.

675
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,757
Like, they're literally near your heart.

676
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,160
Like, they're inside of you,
and there's no one else

677
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,662
that could be as close to your heart
as your babies.

678
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:43,101
[Kim] My bond with my kids is so strong.

679
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,837
I think my biggest fear is
just that, like,

680
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,273
if I had had a surrogate,
what I just don't know…

681
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,075
Like, would I love them the same?

682
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,645
That's, like, the main thing
that I keep on thinking about.

683
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,114
That scares me.

684
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:03,321
There's not a day where I have any thought

685
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,357
that my love for my kids are different.

686
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,259
That my connection
to my kids are different.

687
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,729
-Wow.
-You know, you get to carry one

688
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,764
and have them close to you,
but the other is

689
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,166
'cause you so desperately wanted them
in your family.

690
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:19,871
Yeah, but, like, I don't want
to take the easy way out.

691
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,806
It's not taking the easy way out.

692
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,942
-Mm-hm.
-[Natalie] It's actually saying,

693
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,378
"I want to raise my kids."
It's actually the hard way out.

694
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,079
It's you saying you're not gonna do it.

695
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,081
-Yeah.
-You say you're gonna let

696
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,516
somebody else do that for you

697
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,685
because you want to be with your kids.

698
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,987
[Kim] <i>This is really reassuring.</i>

699
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,722
So she's giving me a lot of hope.

700
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,591
I mean, it's still a lot
for me to think about,

701
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,661
so I really want to, like,
talk it over with my husband.

702
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,195
<i>I have to see</i>

703
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,932
just what I believe God is, like,

704
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,402
putting in my life
and what's meant to be for me.

705
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,636
-[Kim] Thank you so much.
-My pleasure.

706
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,672
Thank you for sharing your story.

707
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,144
Just a lot to think about.

708
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,312
[upbeat music]

709
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,485
[Khloé] So nice out here.

710
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,187
[Kris] It is really pretty.

711
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:10,922
[Kim] Hi.

712
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,526
Today is the lunch with Everytown,

713
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:15,927
and I'm really glad that my mom

714
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,962
and my other sisters are going to join.

715
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,230
{\an8}-Hi. Lucy McBath.
-Hi.

716
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,932
{\an8}-So nice to meet you.
-Mother of Jordan Davis.

717
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,834
-[Lucy] Hi.
-I'm Kris. How are you?

718
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,902
Hi. How are you?

719
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,804
The more we can get this message out,

720
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,707
the better, and I just…
I want them to see something

721
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,608
<i>that I've been really passionate about.</i>

722
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,544
[Christopher]
So, I just wanted to thank everyone

723
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,579
for coming together to share stories,

724
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,681
to talk about
why this work matters so much.

725
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,349
{\an8}We also wanted to thank

726
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,951
{\an8}the Kardashian family for coming here.

727
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,020
Thank you for all the work
that you guys have done.

728
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,522
Um, I know that this has been an issue
that you've been speaking out on.

729
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:46,558
-[applause]
-[Kim] Where is Kendall?

730
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,327
I thought she was gonna be here.

731
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,596
[dramatic music]

732
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,702
-[applause]
-[Kim] Where is Kendall?

733
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,472
I thought she was gonna be here.

734
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,909
I know Kendall had some reservations

735
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,512
about supporting the cause
due to backlash.

736
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,014
I would say if you're passionate
about something,

737
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,384
get behind it 100 percent.
[bleep] the backlash.

738
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,552
Who cares?

739
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,721
<i>So I hope that she does show up.</i>

740
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:21,593
I wanted to kick it off to Lucy
to welcome and share her story

741
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,261
and some of the work that she's doing

742
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,896
and, um, that she's proud of.

743
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,364
[Kendall] Sorry I'm late.
[chuckles]

744
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,901
And there's another little Jenner Kendall.

745
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,703
[laughter]

746
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,772
-[Kendall] Oh, I'm at the head.
-[Kris] Yeah, you are.

747
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,541
[Kendall chuckles]
Hi.

748
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,576
{\an8}Everybody, thank you so much
for coming here.

749
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,945
{\an8}We're very honored
to have you here with us.

750
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,347
[Lucy] I'm the mother of Jordan Davis.

751
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,316
{\an8}<i>He's the young man
that was shot and killed in Jacksonville.</i>

752
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,886
{\an8}<i>One that the country has deemed
"the loud music case."</i>

753
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,388
Moms Demand Action
for Gun Sense in America were

754
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,123
really the ones to give me a platform

755
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,425
to really be able to fight,
not just for Jordan,

756
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,728
but for all Americans that are dying

757
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,396
senselessly around the country.

758
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,633
{\an8}My mom, Dawn, was the principal
that was killed

759
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,268
{\an8}<i>in the Sandy Hook school shooting.</i>

760
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:07,038
{\an8}<i>[Nza-ari] I lost a close friend
to gun violence</i>

761
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,973
{\an8}<i>when, um, I was in high school.</i>

762
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,176
{\an8}Gun violence is just ravaging
our community.

763
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,345
{\an8}My son and their brother
was murdered last year

764
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:18,349
{\an8}outside our family home
by a friend from high school

765
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,151
that he had not seen for four years.

766
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:25,190
{\an8}<i>He, um, shot him seven times
and left him to die.</i>

767
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,662
My dad, he was at a work training event

768
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,298
in San Bernardino last December

769
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,900
{\an8}when, um, his co-workers shot the place,

770
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,902
{\an8}and he, along with 13 other people, died.

771
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,305
{\an8}<i>The weekend before the shooting,</i>

772
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,473
{\an8}<i>we were speaking about workplace violence,</i>

773
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,576
and I had no idea that four days later,

774
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:45,910
my dad would be gone.

775
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,813
[Richard] Chris was our only child.

776
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,416
{\an8}He was everything to us,

777
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,651
{\an8}<i>and the only thing
that's important to me now…</i>

778
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:58,356
{\an8}<i>is try to prevent more families</i>

779
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,358
{\an8}<i>from losing their children like ours did.</i>

780
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,194
Every day that goes by

781
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,063
without us taking our best efforts

782
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,098
to reduce gun violence
in this country means

783
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,101
that more people die for no good reason.

784
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,904
Anything we can do, we're glad, you know,

785
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,074
to be here and just to spread the word.

786
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,277
Hearing all these personal stories

787
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,446
from the people
that actually had to suffer from it

788
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,915
<i>just makes me want to get more involved
in Everytown.</i>

789
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,650
I think it'd be
a little irresponsible of me

790
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,252
to take this platform for granted.

791
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,520
And I think that I need to appreciate it
and use it,

792
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,756
so, I'm just gonna kind of go for it.

793
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,092
[Kim] So handsome.

794
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,461
[Kendall and Kris] Thank you.

795
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:39,564
They say, "Not one more,"
which is what our goal is,

796
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,532
that not one more person has to die…

797
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,667
-[Khloé] Thank you.
-[Richard] …in this country

798
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,936
for reasons that we can prevent.

799
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,274
[Kim] We should all take a group picture,

800
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,076
and start getting
a good message out there.

801
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,445
Can we all squeeze in? Okay.

802
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:58,049
-[woman 1] One, two, three.
-[camera shutter clicks]

803
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,218
[Kim] Is everyone okay
if I post this to social media?

804
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,953
-[woman 1] Sure, yeah.
-[woman 2] Please do.

805
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,222
[upbeat music]

806
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,329
[chuckles]
Okay, bye.

807
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,398
Can I just tell you one little thing?

808
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:14,499
Mm?

809
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,268
It's a little distracting
talking to you with a grill.

810
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,736
I knew you were gonna say that.

811
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,805
I don't know whether
to look at your grill or your boobs.

812
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,807
I'm really so confused today.

813
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,876
It's just the first time
I'm wearing it, so…

814
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,411
Mm.

815
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,314
So there's this woman
that Dr. Huang had me meet with

816
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,616
that had a baby with a surrogate.

817
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,085
I just wanted to know
what her experience was.

818
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,220
Like, is she…

819
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,057
Does she love the baby the same?
Does it feel the same?

820
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,292
Like, is she just as happy? You know?

821
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,828
[Kim] <i>I know what it's like
to have a lot of siblings</i>

822
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,763
and having, like, all of our fun holidays

823
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,166
and what a fun life that is.

824
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:51,636
[Robert]
<i>There's Kourtney and Robert and Khloé.</i>

825
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,339
<i>There we have all four of you.</i>

826
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,974
<i>How beautiful.</i>

827
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,075
[Kim] <i>I think it's, like,</i>

828
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,811
<i>the best support system to have siblings,</i>

829
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,380
so I would love to have one more at least.

830
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,649
So I've kind of come
to the conclusion in my mind

831
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,617
that, okay, I can't carry another one.

832
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:10,488
And now I just want
to, like, explore surrogacy.

833
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,657
I just think that that scares me for you.

834
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,365
{\an8}So there is this woman
that Dr. Huang had me meet with

835
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,734
that had a baby with a surrogate.

836
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,269
I just wanted to know
what her experience was.

837
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,338
Like, is she…

838
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,675
Does she love the baby the same?
Does it feel the same?

839
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,210
Like, is she just as happy? You know?

840
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,579
So I've kind of come to the conclusion
in my mind

841
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,481
that, okay, I can't carry another one.

842
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,485
And now I just want to, like,
explore surrogacy.

843
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,520
I just think that that scares me for you.

844
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,822
Like, what if she gives birth

845
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,525
and then grabs the baby
and makes a run for it?

846
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,460
-Well, I don't think she can.
-Oh.

847
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,998
Also, the best thing is
I could have… a new baby

848
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,167
and have no one know

849
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,337
and live my life for a good year
before we announce it.

850
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,740
But I don't know if it's for me.

851
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,309
-Yeah?
-I really don't know.

852
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,014
[upbeat music]

853
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,757
{\an8}Wait, do you ever post anything
to your private and public?

854
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,293
-[Kendall] Yeah, always.
-[MJ] I'm gonna grab my phone.

855
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,728
So cute.

856
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,129
[MJ] That's what everyone's doing,

857
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,330
-so I might as well do it too.
-[laughter]

858
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,533
[Khloé] Oh, my goodness!

859
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,435
-[Kourtney] Oh, my gosh.
-[Khloé] Stop.

860
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,204
-[Kourtney] That is so small.
-[Khloé] Wait, I want to see her.

861
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,274
[Kendall muttering]

862
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,142
So cute.

863
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,011
That dog is so cute.

864
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,046
-[smooches]
-[Kris] Hey, guys.

865
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,347
Hi, Kenny.

866
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,183
Do you guys want to chat for a second

867
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,252
-about how this is gonna go?
-Okay.

868
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,722
Um, I'm gonna start out by myself.

869
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:56,461
I decide to ask my mom
the questions after all,

870
00:34:56,527 --> 00:35:00,064
<i>but I'm nervous.
I don't want to make this a sad</i>

871
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,834
<i>or emotional experience for my mom.</i>

872
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,270
I'm gonna start slow
and hopefully get through the interviews.

873
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,940
Oh, whoa. This is cool.

874
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,709
-[Kris] Okay, Mom, you ready to do this?
-[MJ] Yeah.

875
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,412
-What year were you born?
-'34.

876
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,348
1934 or 1834?

877
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,684
-19. Uh-huh.
-1934.

878
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,919
And your mom was how old when she had you?

879
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,187
Probably 19.

880
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,455
-Wow.
-[Kris] Really?

881
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,790
[Kris] So, like, Kylie's age.

882
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,559
Yeah, but in those days,
you know, that's what happened.

883
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,329
[Kris] How old were you
when you got kissed the first time?

884
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,463
[MJ] 15.

885
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,866
And who did you kiss?
Do you remember his name?

886
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,101
-Yeah, I married him.
-[Kylie] Oh, how amazing.

887
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,170
-Her first kiss she married.
-[Khloé] That's so cute.

888
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,239
But we were only married two months.

889
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,874
-Two months?
-Yeah.

890
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,108
Less than Kimmy.

891
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,277
[laughter]

892
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,514
-What's your biggest fear?
-Biggest fear.

893
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,048
[MJ] I try not to fear.

894
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,950
What's your biggest fear?

895
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,586
[emotional music]

896
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,423
[voice breaking]
I don't wanna say it.

897
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,666
Why did you ask me that?
I can't believe I'm crying.

898
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,969
Just losing someone.

899
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,540
[Khloé] Oh, my god, I'm gonna cry.

900
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,310
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

901
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,451
{\an8}[MJ] What's your biggest fear?

902
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,054
[emotional music]

903
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,424
[voice breaking]
I don't wanna say it.

904
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,267
Why did you ask me that?
I can't believe I'm crying.

905
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,271
Just losing someone.

906
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,808
[Khloé] Oh, my god, I'm gonna cry.

907
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,781
[emotional music continues]

908
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,291
Just emotional.

909
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,360
[Khloé] What are you upset about?

910
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,897
It makes me realize
that she's not gonna always be here

911
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,499
and she's not gonna live
that much longer and…

912
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,134
Yeah, but most people don't have
the opportunity

913
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,437
to even get, like,
these questions answered,

914
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:20,571
-do you know?
-Yeah, I know.

915
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,206
So I think it's, like, a blessing.

916
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,243
[Kris]
Losing her… It's gonna be really hard…

917
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,811
[sniffles]
…when she's not here.

918
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,046
But… And I'm glad we're doing this, but…

919
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,216
And it's hard to lose a parent.
But you can't think like that.

920
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,317
-Like, you can't be…
-[Kris] No, you can't…

921
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,120
but when you're talking
about someone's life…

922
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,989
[Khloé] But she's had, like, a great life,

923
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,257
-you know?
-Yeah.

924
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,157
-[Khloé] And…
-Yeah.

925
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,159
At least she's had 82 years.

926
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,862
You get to have these memories,
and you get to do this.

927
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,897
Many people… Like my dad,
they didn't have the opp--

928
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,432
-You don't get to talk about anything,
-[Kris] Yeah.

929
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,767
-[Kris] Yeah.
-You know?

930
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:50,901
-So…
-[Kris sniffles]

931
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,703
[Khloé] We're lucky.

932
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,639
[Kris] <i>I know that Khloé's right.</i>

933
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,141
I'm just an emotional person who,

934
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,477
when I start talking to somebody I love,

935
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,612
especially about memories and…

936
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,850
<i>anything about life,
I just get real mushy.</i>

937
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,653
So, I just need to get
one of my kids to take over,

938
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,588
<i>so I can pull it together.</i>

939
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,789
[Kim] Are we ready?

940
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,891
I'll start with the first question.

941
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,793
If you could only save one grandchild…

942
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,861
-[MJ gasps]
-…who would it be?

943
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,129
-Oh, my god.
-[MJ] Oh, no.

944
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,764
I declare the fifth.

945
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,499
[laughter]

946
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,933
Okay, the fifth grandchild?

947
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,268
[laughing]

948
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,004
How many people have you slept with?

949
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,806
[MJ] Oh, that's a good question.

950
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,875
-Four.
-Four total?

951
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,144
-No, four that I remember.
-[Kendall] Remember, yeah.

952
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,313
[laughing]

953
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,882
[Kourtney] Were you a party animal?

954
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,617
Uh, between husbands,

955
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,286
I went out a lot with the girls
and went to bars

956
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,155
and learned to salsa and all that.

957
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:47,124
Do you have any favorite sayings
or quotes that you live by?

958
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,492
[MJ] Always try harder.

959
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,727
Do your best.

960
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,862
That's all we can do.

961
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,533
[Kourtney] What is the best thing
about growing older?

962
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,835
[MJ] I figure if you make it this far,
it's all good.

963
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:58,736
[chuckles]

964
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,273
[Kris] <i>It's pretty awesome seeing my kids</i>

965
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,009
interview MJ about her life.

966
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:09,013
And about her story and her memories

967
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,917
<i>and just have it on film
as something that will last forever.</i>

968
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,019
[Kourtney] Okay, I think we're good.

969
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,954
[Kendall] Yeah, we'll let Khloé do it now.

970
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,557
[Khloé]
Mom, why don't you come back out with me.

971
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,359
[Kris] I would love to.

972
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,196
[Khloé] Where'd you get your style from?

973
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,464
[MJ] Probably my mom.

974
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,667
And I think, you know, I love the movies,
and I think I got it from that.

975
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,836
'Cause we always say we get it from you,

976
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,138
because you gave it to my mom.

977
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,640
Do you wish you had a boyfriend right now?

978
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,910
Most of the guys that would be my age…

979
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,612
-are gone, number one.
-You don't, you don't have to date

980
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,847
anyone your age.

981
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,849
-Look at Kris Jenner.
-[MJ] Well, yeah.

982
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:48,319
[laughter]

983
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,654
What is your most treasured possession?

984
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,057
I don't know. I don't like possessions.

985
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,127
I'm not hoarding things for that reason.

986
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,028
I hoard them for sentimental reasons.

987
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,797
[MJ] I do have a garage full of the things

988
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,499
you've sent over to my house…

989
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,566
[laughs]

990
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,268
…like chairs and things you want to hoard.

991
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,970
[Kris] They're all gone.

992
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,005
Well, I save what I want to.

993
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,274
What do you think is
the most precious thing

994
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,375
that you've kept?

995
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,344
Well, now, let me think.

996
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,179
Your baby pictures?

997
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,514
-Aww…
-[MJ chuckles]

998
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,551
-If you could have one superpower…
-That I could fly

999
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,953
so I could go back and forth quicker…

1000
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,121
to see you.

1001
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,226
[Kris]
What's your idea of perfect happiness?

1002
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:33,597
Well, being around all my kids
and, uh, seeing everyone happy.

1003
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,633
[MJ] I'm very happy to be here.

1004
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,468
Yeah, I like waking up
in the morning and saying,

1005
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,538
-"Thank you, God. One more day."
-[Khloé] Aww.

1006
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,406
-[MJ] Yeah. Don't you?
-[Khloé] Mm-hm.

1007
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,707
We're lucky.

1008
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,309
-Super lucky.
-Yeah.

1009
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,210
Blessed.

1010
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,778
All right.

1011
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,213
-We're out.
-[laughs]

1012
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,848
-Give me a hug.
-Okay.

1013
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,583
-[Kris] I love you, Mom.
-Love you too.

1014
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,818
I'm so happy

1015
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,786
-that I did this.
-I love you, MJ.

1016
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:56,921
[Kris] <i>Khloé was right.</i>

1017
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,256
It's definitely a lot more sentimental

1018
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,591
<i>and personal this way.</i>

1019
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,359
[Kris] Thank God we have that on tape.

1020
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,562
-Yeah. I told you.
-You know, forever.

1021
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,996
I know it's emotional, but…

1022
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,199
most people don't get to do
this kind of stuff.

1023
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,667
{\an8}I know. Thank you.

1024
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,735
{\an8}-[Kris] Love you.
-Love you too.

1025
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,137
{\an8}-Oh, thank you.
-[Kris] Thank you.

1026
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,141
[Kris]
Sometimes, the young ones are smarter

1027
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,542
than the older ones.

1028
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,412
[Kim] <i>Next on</i>
Keeping Up with the Kardashians…

1029
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,614
-Have you read any baby books?
-No.

1030
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:24,949
Do you know how to take care of a baby?

1031
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,217
No.
[chuckles]

1032
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:29,053
-[Rob] Is that okay, little girl?
-Poor guy just gave his kid pinkeye.

1033
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,555
Kim, are you not coming to my meeting?

1034
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,057
[Kim on phone] <i>What meeting?</i>

1035
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,291
[Khloé] You always talk [bleep] about Mom.

1036
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,593
"Oh, she's a horrible manager."

1037
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,828
You're taking over for Mom
when you're acting just like Mom.

1038
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,665
[Alexa] Your mom, I think,
was just in an accident.

1039
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:42,566
[siren wailing]

1040
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,368
[tense music]
