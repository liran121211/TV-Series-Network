00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,306
{\an8}[Scott] Look at this. You want a necklace?

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,742
{\an8}Scott and I had one extra night in Vail.

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:14,314
{\an8}I think realizing Scott can come
on our family vacations was big.

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,582
{\an8}[Randy] What do you wanna do?

5
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,517
{\an8}Go… go to the room and party.

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,820
{\an8}[laughter]

7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,024
{\an8}You guys, Rob proposed
in front of her whole family

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,325
{\an8}at her house last night.

9
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,427
{\an8}[Rob] It happened, like, spontaneously,

10
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,295
{\an8}so that's why you guys weren't
in the loop.

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,165
{\an8}Do you understand
that that was hurtful to us

12
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,167
{\an8}that we found out about your engagement

13
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,502
{\an8}-on social media?
-Yes, I understand.

14
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,570
{\an8}There's one more thing I have
to talk to you guys about,

15
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:38,972
{\an8}but I don't want you guys to get mad.

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,573
{\an8}[Kourtney] You're having a baby.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,809
{\an8}-Yeah.
-Congratulations.

18
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,210
{\an8}I know Khloé's probably feeling--

19
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,512
{\an8}[Khloé] Congratulations.

20
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,380
{\an8}I personally don't know what the next step

21
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,882
{\an8}for all of us is.

22
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,550
{\an8}I mean, that's up to Rob.

23
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,888
[upbeat music]

24
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,663
What do you think life is like
with three kids?

25
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,131
-Different than two?
-[clears throat]

26
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,699
Or same as two?

27
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,535
No, it's different, I think.

28
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,603
Why? Are you thinking
about having a third?

29
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,572
Kanye has said it every single day

30
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,041
-for, like, the last week.
-Really?

31
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,510
And I was like, I don't think
I can carry another one.

32
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,245
I just feel like…

33
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:22,082
[groans]
I'll never be the same down there.

34
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,150
Kanye says it, like, feels the same.

35
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,386
Wait, tell me.
Do you think it's different?

36
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,688
-Dude, 100 percent things change.
-[Kim gasps]

37
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,824
Like, it's like throwing
a hot dog through a hallway?

38
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,592
No, it's not about that.

39
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,694
-I heard that ought to feel.
-I feel like me and Kanye

40
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,929
don't care about that. It's like,

41
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,363
the fact that, like…

42
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,034
something that big has come
in and out of there,

43
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,369
like, things are
just different internally.

44
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,071
There's just, like, bumps and curves

45
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,773
that, like, you know
what I'm saying? Like…

46
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,208
-Oh, my god.
-It's just not the same.

47
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,409
It's like the same house,

48
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,077
but the furniture's been rearranged.

49
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,080
-Correct. Like, exactly.
-Huh.

50
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,915
The front door is still the same,

51
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,585
but inside, all of your couches
have been spread apart

52
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,920
and mixed and matched
like a hurricane hit.

53
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,889
Yeah, that's a good analogy.

54
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,591
[bleep] my life.

{\an8}[upbeat music]

{\an8}Oh, you dropped it.

59
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,481
[Khloé] Are you gonna dive?

Go, Gabbana, go.

Go, go, dive.

62
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,786
Dive, dive, dive! You can do it.

63
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,321
You can do it!

64
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,892
Dive! Yeah, go under.

65

You did it! Good girl!

66
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:47,333
So, have you told anybody
about Rob and Chyna?

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,971
No. I have no one to tell,
nor do I care to be, like,

68
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,174
-the person that…
-Tells?

69
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,876
Yeah, and also there's so much,
like, drama with them.

70
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,612
I don't want them to get mad
if we do say something,

71
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,781
so I'm acting like nothing's happening.

72
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,550
But how do you feel?

73
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,985
[pensive music]

74
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,587
I mean, it's Rob's life.

75
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,322
I don't know.

76
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,758
[Khloé] How do you feel?

77
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,963
I feel like children
are a blessing from God.

78
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,298
[Khloé] Okay.

79
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,535
And that, you know,
it's God's plan and, like,

80
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,904
I just want him to be happy, really.

81
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,409
My brother and I have always had
such a strong connection,

82
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,578
and we've always been so close.

83
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,380
So what bothers me is not that
he's engaged,

84
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,648
not that he's having a baby,

85
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,052
but that Rob has completely
just disconnected from me.

86
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,589
He hasn't spoken to me
since he told us Chyna was pregnant.

87
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,557
He's not including me in his new life,

88
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,259
so how could I be happy

89
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,162
for someone or something
that I know nothing about?

90
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,397
[Kourtney] Hopefully,
it's all for the right reasons.

91
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,199
I mean, I've never really known her.

92
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,501
Like, I've never had
a relationship with her.

93
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,270
-Mm-hmm.
-So I don't know

94
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,005
the type of person she is.

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,475
She must be somewhat of a good person

96
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,611
for Rob to like her.

97
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,212
'Cause Rob's funny and charming.

98
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,180
Yeah.

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,016
I like this, um, fabric.

100
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,086
It's called something magical,
such as terrycloth.

the video for "Highlights"

114
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,429
this weekend in Iceland.

115
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,265
He just really wants me there
when he's shooting the video.

116
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,267
Every time Kanye and I have a project

117
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,736
that each other's working on,
we definitely try to be there

118
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,172
just to give, like,
moral support and input.

119
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,774
We really do feed off each other a lot,

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,209
so I know it's really important to him
that I come to Iceland.

121
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,078
-[Kourtney] That'll be fun.
-[Kim] Yeah.

122
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,314
And I really want you to go with me.

123
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,850
[Kourtney] Um, it's during my birthday.

124
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,786
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-I think I would still go.

125
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,354
[Kim] Yeah, why not?
Make it a birthday trip.

126
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,422
Yeah.

127
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,691
-Jonathan and Simon would come.
-Yeah.

128
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:28,094
I always get anxious to, like,
travel and not bring the kids,

129
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,463
but that's my favorite song
from the album.

130
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,998
I feel like it would be fun.

131
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,734
[Kourtney] I've always wanted
to go to Iceland,

132
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,937
but I just don't know
how I'm going to feel

133
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,406
being away from my kids on my birthday.

134
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,342
But I wanna be adventurous

135
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,077
and do things that are different,

136
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:48,147
so I think it's fine to do
this quick trip to Iceland,

137
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,516
and just, like, live life and have fun.

that the radiation on airplanes,

[Khloé] Okay. Well,
you can't just sit at home

153
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,362
and eat Twinkies and soda and lose weight.

154
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,332
If that was the case,
I would've been super skinny years ago.

-Why not?

Rob has disconnected himself from us,

162
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,387
apparently, mainly me.
He doesn't talk to me.

163

I hear he talks to my sisters way more.

won't answer my phone call.

-[Kourtney] No.

-Yes.
-Oh.

-[Mason] Oh, cool.
-That's weird.

something locally,

and give her a hug or give her a gift.

One of the things
that Kourtney and I argued about

I never really fought enough for her,

320
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,955
so now I'm thinking,
should I go to Iceland?

321
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,291
Because maybe now, she would appreciate me

322

-[Jonathan] It's beautiful.

342
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,880
[Knútur] Here, we try to grow
what's healthy, tasty,

343
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,849
good, fresh tomatoes as possible.

344
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,550
[Kourtney]
Wait. Is that all bees in there?

345
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,752
Yeah. The flowers,
they need to be pollinate.

346
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,788
Otherwise, we will not have many tomatoes.

347
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,390
And to help us to do that,
we have the bumblebees.

348
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,860
About 600 active bumblebees.

349
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:21,961
-[Kim] Oh, my…
-Oh, my god, hold on.

350
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,162
-[gasps]
-[Jonathan screams]

351
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,630
Sorry.
[Kourtney yelps]

352
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,232
Are these the killer bees?

353
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,466
No, no, no. These are bumblebees.

354
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,601
They are very friendly.

355
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,069
[Kourtney]
Kim used to be friends with bees

356
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,237
-when she was little.
-[man laughs]

357
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,972
I used to really like bees.

358
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,141
[upbeat music]

359
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,311
-Cheers.
-[Knútur murmurs]

-[indistinct chatter]

361
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,916
Yes, guys.

362
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,150
This is called living.

363
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,353
I just put basil in your drink.

364
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,154
[Kim] Wait. Can you believe
it's your birthday week?

365
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,090
-Are you so excited?
-[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.

366
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:54,126
But if you think about it,
for the last ten years,

367
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,495
like, we've all been in, like, Mexico

368
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,398
or, like, something with you guys.

369
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,432
[Kourtney] True.

370
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,034
I feel like Iceland's a good change.

371
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,971
I'm definitely happy that I came,

372
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,475
and that I'm doing something different
for my birthday,

373
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,411
but I feel like I'm a little bit homesick.

374
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,047
I definitely miss my kids so much.

375
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,918
But I'm just gonna try to make
the most of it while I'm here.

376
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,552
Aren't you going to the video shoot?

377
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,687
Yeah.

378
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,022
-[Kim] Do you wanna come?
-I don't know.

379
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,189
[Simon] How far is the shoot?

380
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,891
[Kim] It's 90 minutes,

381
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,660
but it's atop of a glacier.

382
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,828
-[Kanye] Do I have to take a helicopter?
-[Kim] It's a helicopter.

383
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,497
I'm not so much a helicopter person.

384
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,898
But you're gonna do it anyway?

385
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,233
Yeah, I got to do it for the shoot.

386
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,602
[Kanye] It's hard to shoot these videos.

387
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,805
Like, I was in Scotland,
took a helicopter over.

388
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,640
It was below the wind chill.

389
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,208
You know, on the side of a rock.

390
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,810
You step two steps over, you could die.

391
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,545
-Kill yourself, yup.
-And I was just sitting there,

392
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,846
I was like,
"Man, people don't give a [bleep]

393
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,415
about videos like that anymore,

394
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,817
and people don't appreciate, like,
all the work you put into it."

395
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:52,985
-[Kim] Yeah.
-I need to do

396
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,086
some [bleep] on green screen.

397
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,788
[laughter]

398
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,690
[Knútur] This is a tomato ice cream.

399
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,692
Everything is made out of tomato.

400
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,694
-[Simon] Tomato ice cream.
-That's the tomato on top.

401
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,462
[Jonathan] Yeah, yeah,
that's the tomato on top.

402
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,331
[laughter]

403
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,599
Do you have cappuccino
without a tomato blend?

404
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,202

00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,673
What up, man? How you doing, son?

407
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,108
-[man 3] Can I get a photo?
-Yeah, let's take it, yeah.

408
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,678
[man 3] Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.

-[Kourtney] What? It smells?
-[laughter]

410
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,717
-[Simon] Someone tooted?
-[Nicole] There was a toot.

411
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,919
[Simon] Well, it's definitely one of us.

412
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,953
-[both laugh]
-Jonathan.

413
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,855
Just 'cause my shirt's the color of tomato

414
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,623
doesn't mean I [bleep] farted.

415

They're thicker.

-Oh.
-Hold on.

Okay, that's fine.

[Malika] What's going on with you?

423
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,351
{\an8}I'm a little frustrated
'cause I was with Lam,

424
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,687
{\an8}and he was FaceTiming Rob,

425
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,223
and they were, like, talking, and like,
"Oh, I wanna see you, let's hang out."

426
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,357
Blah, blah, blah.

427
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,394
Rob is making such an effort
to hang out with Lam,

428
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,330
but yet Rob still hasn't seen me,
nor will he talk to me.

429
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,034
So it's a little…
Like, I'm a little annoyed

430
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,301
-by that.
-Mm-hmm.

431
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,437
But, okay, so what do I have to do?

432
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,872
You feel left out?

433
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,840
No. I don't care to do what they're doing.

434
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,109
I just feel like I'm owed,
like, a conversation

435
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,011
ever since he's moved out of here.

436
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,647
It's like, okay, so you do have time.

437
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,683
I just wish you guys could break the ice.
I don't see why…

438
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,519
Break the ice,
like we don't know each other.

439
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,554
[Malika] No, well, that's how
you guys are acting.

440
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,655
It's, like, ver-- I'm sorry,

441
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,257
even to hear it is, like, very strange.

442
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,426
Mm-hm. It's so weird.

443
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,994
I don't get it.

444
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,297

this one little thing

445
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,366
that needs to be done to fix it.

446

If I'm not invited to hang out
or do something,

447

what am I supposed to do?

This is the only issue, I think,
why everyone cared,

502
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,996
was because she, like,

-She's really funny. Like…

509
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,311
-Chyna?
-Yeah, she's a laugher.

510
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,879
I remember her with Kim, she was so…

511
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,747
She used to be, "I love her.
Oh, you're so funny."

512
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:16,748
She used to giggle, and then, like,

513
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,417
everything went sour so fast…

514
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,119
I mean, I remember them doing
those sexy mirror pictures

515
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,588
-in their… in the bathroom.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

516
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,689
Yeah, yeah.

517
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,656
-Why did she stop…
-I used to, like…

518
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,024
-…talking to her?
-…go on walks with her

519
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:26,925
in the neighborhood.

520
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,694
-Okay.
-Scott and I would hang out

521
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,662
with Chyna and Tyga.

522
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,164
-When he moved into our neighborhood.
-Right.

523
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,199
We would go just hang out at their house.

524
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,301
We'd all go to dinner together
with the kids.

525
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,574
In the past, Kim and I
were friends with Chyna,

526
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,611
but I think that for everyone else, like,

527
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,413
they're gonna have to get
to know her from scratch.

528
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,984
And I know not everybody feels
the same way that I do right now,

529
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,785
but because it's my brother,

530
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,954
and she's going to be family,

531
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,890
I think that we just need
to figure it out.

532
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,592
-Good for him.
-I hope they get married.

533
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,427
-That wedding will be wild.
-[Jonathan] Oh, my god.

534
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,529
[Simon] His sense of humor is beyond.

535
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,798
-[Jonathan] That's funny.
-[laughs]

536
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,533
He is, like, wild.

537
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,469
-So quirky.
-[Kourtney] He is.

538
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,771
He's the funniest ever.

539
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:13,905
[chuckles]

540
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,575
[upbeat music]

541
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,483
-[Kourtney] Guys, look.
-[Jonathan] Wow.

542
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,451
This is unreal.

543
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,920
This is… beyond.

544
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,064
-Guys, how is it?
-[Kourtney] Wait.

545
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,565
-[Simon] Beautiful.
-You have to start, though,

546
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,767
from the beginning.

547
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,368
Yeah, we will. We're just taking a pic.

548
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,138
So I just left Kanye at his fitting,

549
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,874
and I'm meeting up
with the group at the Blue Lagoon.

550
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,776
This place is so amazing.

551
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,210
I am so excited to be here.

552
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,579
It's like the Fountain of Youth,
supposedly.

553
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,519
[Kim] What is this that I'm stepping on?

554
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,787
That's the slimy stuff.

555
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,188
[Jonathan] That's the stuff
that goes on your face.

556
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,324
[Kourtney] I keep grabbing it
off the walls.

557
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,159
[Jonathan] It is all over my face.
I thought it was clear.

558
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,428
-[Simon] Oh, god, it feels so…
-[Jonathan] Does it look clear to you?

559
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,363
-[laughter]
-No, it's… it's turquoise.

560
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,131
-[Jonathan] What?
-[Kim] It's like…

561
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,232
it's, like, the color of the water.

562
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,300
-[Jonathan] Are you serious?
-Yeah, it's like

563
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,435
-a green… it looks white.
-[Simon] Are you guys dipping

564
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,769
into the water?

565
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,739
[Kim] Should we FaceTime Scott
and show him?

566
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:21,973
[Kourtney] Sure.

567
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,442
[line ringing]

568
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,509
-[Nicole] Oh.
-Oh.

569
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,044
[Jonathan] Wow, okay.

570
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,113
-[Kourtney chuckles]
-What's going on with you guys?

571
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,781
-Um…
-[line ringing]

572
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,484
We're just doing our best to co-parent.

573
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,286
[Kim] Yeah, that's the most important.

574
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,654
And getting along.

575
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,322
[Kim] Yeah.

576
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,425
[somber music]

577
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,062
I know that Scott was
a little bit disappointed

578
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,998
that I wasn't going to be
spending my birthday

579
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,600
with him and the kids,

580
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,069
but I do think part of figuring out

581
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,772
how to co-parent is realizing

582
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,775
that experiences together are great,

583
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:00,512
but we are going to have some experiences

584
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,980
not together, as well,

585
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,783
and I think that's equally as important.

586
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,819
-He gets so carried away…
-Sensitive, yeah.

587
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,488
-…and ahead of himself.
-[Kim] Yeah.

588
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,189
I just feel like I don't wanna just

589
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,724
{\an8}-spend time with him one on one…
-I was like, "Don't…"

590
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,159
…because that's not…

591
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,261
What is that gonna benefit anybody?

592
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,295
[Kim] Yeah.

593
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,364
That's just not what I want right now

594
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,533
-and it's not what's good.
-[Kim] Yeah.

595
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,635
[Kourtney] All right,
should we go get our drinks?

596
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,737
[Kim] You guys, don't you think
we should all take a pic.

597
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,239
-Yeah.
-I wanted to show cleavage

598
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,607
-and I was like…
-Yeah.

599
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,041
-Got it.
-Wait, Kourt,

600
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,109
you're blocking my boobs.

601

-We keep moving.
-[laughter]

One, two, three.

604
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,485
I don't have any cleavage to show.

605
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,953
All right, should we go back?

606
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,355

Hearing that Kourt's having
some fabulous time in Iceland

630
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,941
and knowing I'm not there is definitely

631

a little hard to hear.

632

I mean, at the end of the day,
I want Kourt to be happy

and I want her to have
the best time she can have.

I would come with Kourtney and them, like,

at the end of the day.

00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,782
The one thing I was out here to do,
I missed.

848
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,451
-So today was my fault.
-For what? What happened?

849
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,854
I think he thinks, like,
"Kourt and her friends are coming,

850
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,022
-and they'll just hang out."
-Yeah.

851
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,723
"We might see them, but, you know…"

852
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,658
But now it's like,
"Oh, babe, I might see you."

853
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:48,893
[chuckles]
You know?

854
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,629
Like, we flew all the way
out here for him,

855
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,232
and I did say from the beginning,

856
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,168
my number one priority is the video.

857
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,203
I usually have my [bleep] together,
so I'm…

858
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,072
just really kind of disappointed
in myself.

859
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,675
And I just… I don't know
what the right thing to do is.

[Kourtney] So do you think we're getting
some Northern Lights action tonight?

00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,357
[Simon] I pray.

863

People fly to Iceland
just to see the Northern Lights.

865
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,003
[Kourtney] It's not guaranteed
that you can see them,

866
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,237
but we're hoping,

867
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:36,107
hoping, hoping
that we will get to see them.

868
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,444
[Kim] Wow, that is un… That's beautiful.

[Kourtney chuckles]
The wine is over there, guys.

870
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,782
I double dog dare one of you to jump in.

-[Kourtney] Yes!

Guys, is there a chance
that we're gonna see some kind

-Nope.

875
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,425
-[Jonathan] Zero?
-Zero chance.

-Where's the moon?
-The moon's, like fully covered.

[Kourtney]
Even though it was hard to leave the kids,

878
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,899
I'm glad that Kim and Kanye,

879
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,135
you know, took me
on this adventure with them.

880
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,971
[Kourtney] Kanye.
Here, I feel like you'll like this.

881
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,273
-It's, like, hot red wine.
-[Kanye] Nah, I'm okay.

882
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,642
-[Kourtney] Okay.
-[Kanye] Kim! You're not waiting for me?

883
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,411
Okay, I'm getting in the car.

884
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,146
You wanna get in the car?

885
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,948
[Kanye] Yeah, I'm down to go in the car.

886

[Kourtney] Okay, a quick toast.

Where's Kim and Kanye?

888

They went in the car.

889
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,720
[Kourtney] They went on the bus?

890
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,490
They're the worst people to travel with!

891
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,158
The Wests suck!

892
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:28,559
[Kim] I feel bad.

893
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,961
Today was a mistake.

894
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,230
I'd love to, like, come to the studio.

895
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,166
I do feel so bad about missing the video.

896
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,335
We have one more night here,
so I just want a night

897

of the two of us alone,

898
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,739
and I really do wanna see
how the video is going,

899
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,142
and I just wanna do what I can
to make up for it.

00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,943
-We made it to Iceland…
-You're so sweet.

…but we didn't make it
to the Northern Lights.

But our northern light is you, tonight.

Are you trying to do
something funny right now?

No, no, I'm trying to get you to smell it.

-Smell my cologne.

-[Lamar] You like it?
-[Rob] Yeah, I do.

that Rob is finally willing to talk,

928
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,118
but it's super awkward at first.

929
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,253
Very awkward.

930
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,722
We need to get over this initial moment.

-[Lamar] I mean, you know…
-Sounds like it.

I felt like something was in my throat.

It's called nicotine.

937
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,472

talking about the other day

00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,279
when you said why I don't call Khloé?

941
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,580
-[Lamar] Yeah.
-It's 'cause…

942
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,383

[Lamar] Um, do you wanna go out
with Rob, soon, to dinner?

948
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,236
And Blac Chyna?

949
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,238
[Khloé] No, that's not part of the plan.

-No. 'Cause I'm not

[Khloé] I need to talk to Rob first.

954
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,147
Rob and I just need to have
a private conversation

955
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,249
and just have a talk
and let's hash things out

956
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,885
so we could just move on
and get out of this awkward space.

957
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,522
I think we should all get dinner together,

958
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,858
or hang out here at the house.

959
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,192

we should all definitely do something.

00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,009

971
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:39,083
but I want my relationship
back with my brother,

972
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,484
so, I don't know.

00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,463
You had to go to Iceland
to go to a tomato farm?

1017
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,867
[Scott] I definitely wanted to be there
and it was just one more thing

1018
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,402
I didn't wanna miss.

1019
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:42,440
I mean, it's difficult being not together
with someone you've been with for so long

1020
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,708
and somebody that you're still
close friends with,

1021
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,444
and I guess this is just one more thing

1022
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,012
that, you know, you got to get used to.

1023
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,314
[Kourtney] Ready for the cow ride, guys?

1024
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,684
Okay, I'm going in, um, Molly Moo.

1025
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,419
Scott, which one are you going in?

1026
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,121
[Scott] Can I drive the tractor?

1027
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,657
[Kourtney] No, there's no way
that you're not getting in it.

1028
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,225
[Scott] I can't get in this thing.

1029
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,694
Yeah, you can. I squeezed my butt in.

1030
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,530
What… Are you… My legs don't go in here.

1031
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,165
{\an8}There's a bigger one, look.

1032
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,500
{\an8}[Scott] God…

1033
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,069
{\an8}-Oh, this is like, oh…
-[Kourtney] Yeah!

1034
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,437
-Living the dream.
-[Scott whoops]

1035
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,307
[Scott] American Airlines,
all the way up front.

1036
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,075
Living the dream.

1037
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,211
[Kim] <i>Next on</i> Keeping Up
with the Kardashians…

1038
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:23,614
{\an8}I have to do Fergie's video about MILFS.

1039
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,382
What's going on with the stalker?

1040
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,884
He's out of the psychiatric ward.

1041
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,886
He didn't just get released, he escaped.

1042
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,855
Kylie needs a wake-up call.

1043
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,656
[Kylie] What's on my car?

1044
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,625
I did an interview for <i>GQ.</i>

1045
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,528
[Kim] I've had it with people

1046
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,463
blatantly treating my husband
a certain way

1047
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,432
and making him look a certain way,

1048
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,067
and I'm gonna say how I feel.

1049
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,102
He really did wanna do the right thing.
