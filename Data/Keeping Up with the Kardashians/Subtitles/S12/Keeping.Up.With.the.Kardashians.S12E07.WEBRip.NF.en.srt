{\an8}[Kris] Where's Scott?

00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:06,806
{\an8}[Kourtney] Scott and Tyga
have been hanging out

3
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,442
{\an8}at his house, all day and night.

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,911
{\an8}I almost wanna, like, call Tyga

5
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,114
{\an8}and just literally go off on him.

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,752
{\an8}Like, don't we kind of think
it's a miracle?

7
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,521
{\an8}That Rob wants to be so public
blows my mind.

8
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,223
{\an8}She gave him confidence.

9
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,524
{\an8}More power to her.

10
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,394
{\an8}[Khloé] Am I happy
he's out and about? For sure.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,096
{\an8}Am I disappointed
that Rob isn't talking to me?

12
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,265
{\an8}Yeah. That's just
where it gets frustrating.

-[Khloé] Hi, how are you?

-Khloé. Nice to meet you.

{\an8}-Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
-How cool.

-No.

-No? Are you sure?
-[Mason] Yeah.

23
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:53,853
Because I'm gonna test that today.

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,188
-[Mason] Okay.
-All right?

25
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,956
You just come on over here. Come on, bud.

26
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,225
[Flip] See if you can climb
all the way to the middle, Mase.

27
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,560
With your hands only.

28
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,095
[Kourtney] Khlo, take a picture of Mase.

29
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,363
[Khloé] I'm videotaping him.

30
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,632
-[Mason] Can I let go?
-[Flip] Yeah, you can let go.

31
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:06,599
[Mason whoops]

32
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,935
-[Flip] There you go.
-[Kourtney] Oh, my goodness.

33
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,370
Khlo, you have to do something,

34
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,971
like, you just have to jump off there.

35
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,040
-I don't like heights, though.
-Yeah, go do it with Mase.

36
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,108
-I'll do it with you.
-[Flip] That gives you more

37
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,676
of a reason to do it.

38
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,911
[Khloé] Oh, my god.

39
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,814
It's like, sorry, I can't handle this.
[laughs]

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,782
Mase, you gonna show them how to do it?

41
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,917
Go for it!

-[Flip] KoKo, jump, okay?
-[laughs]

46
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,394
[Flip] Come on, KoKo, you can do it.

47
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,229
-[Khloé] Oh, my, I literally just--
-[Flip] Walk in.

48
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,497
-[Kourtney] Just do it.
-Okay.

-Just do it.
-[Mason] KoKo!

I'll give you my 100 bucks!

Okay.

Oh, my god, I just can't do this.

I have chargers right here.

-[Kourtney] On me?
-[Kim] Yeah.

-Right there. I'm not.
-Don't pull it out.

That's okay. I'm 36.

Who's Rob?

82
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,646
I think that Rob has his life with Chyna.

83
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,215
And I'm happy that Rob is at least

getting out of the house and living life,

85
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,819
but I just hope
that it will get to the place

86
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:10,290
where he wants to hang out
with his family again.

00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,426
You guys, I wonder what my boobs
are gonna look like

Years ago, I used to tape up my boobs.
This is 2009.

And I'm like, it is masking tape
on another level,

91
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,769
and now it's duct tape.

is brilliant.

115
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:19,325
Because that's where my kids and I,
and their dad,

116
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,294
spent most of their childhood

117

on every family vacation
during the winter.

118

of my family's life

120
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,271
and memories that we made
that will last a lifetime.

And it's just the perfect place
to take the family.

-great memories.
-Right.

I'll get 'em to meet me at the airport.

135
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,730
I'll tell the pilots not to say
where we're going,

-Can't tell you.

169

I can't tell you 'cause it's a surprise,

00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,516
but it's like
a one-and-a-half-hour flight,

Planning this family vacation
is more difficult than it seems

175

that I have to navigate

177

my 60th birthday present

and say "happy birthday."

to call you on your birthday.</i>

-[Kourtney] Oh, my god, remember…

-…look at purses.
-…when we used to do that

188
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,700
and then we would put butter on it

-with cinnamon sugar?
-[Kylie] Guys…

-Mom, where's your ghee?
-[Kris] I don't know anymore.

191
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,907
[Kourtney] What goes on in this house?

192
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,875
Gotta use this [bleep].

193
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,744
[bleep]-A.

194
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,479
[Kris] So do you guys want me to tell you

195
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,515
why I asked you to come over,
aside from cooking eggs?

196
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,817
[Kourtney] Sure.

197
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:34,987
So, we're gonna go on our family vacation,

198
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,423
and I just wanted to let everyone know

199
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,225
that I'm not gonna tell you
where you're going.

200
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,226
[Kourtney] Okay.

201
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,228
But I'll tell you,
you might wanna bring a sweater.

202
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,330
[Kris] I got a private plane

203
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,666
-and we're leaving Van Nuys…
-[camera shutter clicks]

204
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,335
…at ten o'clock sharp…

205
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,337
-[Kim] Mix it up.
-…on Monday morning.

206
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,738
-Okay.
-[Kourtney] Add a little…

207
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,373
-And we're gonna be gone…
-…sea salt and pepper.

208
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,509
-[Kim] Wait, do not snap.
-…for four days.

209
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,511
-She's saying when we're going.
-Oh, yeah, sorry, sorry.

210
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,213
[Kylie] Wait, let me make sure
this posted real quick.

211
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,415
[Kourtney] I don't think
you've said what we're doing.

[indistinct chatter]

213
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,985
Well, I just said we're leaving
Van Nuys at 10:00 a.m.

214
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,987
-on Monday morning.
-[Kim] Yeah.

215
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,122
You have to come with a great attitude

216
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,357
and a sense of adventure.

217
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,992
[Kourtney] When do we not?

218
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,094
Who's going on this trip?

219
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,230
-Is it just the girls?
-[Kris] No.

220
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,433
It's as many family members
as we can pull together

221
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,168
-who wanna go.
-[Kourtney] Is Kendall going?

222
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,704
-[Kris] Kendall is going.
-What about Rob?

223
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,339
Rob is supposed to go.

224
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,708
-He's really going?
-[Kris] He's so coming.

225
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,811
I have not told Rob
what kind of a trip it is,

226
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,881
and Scott wanted to know
if he could come on the trip.

227
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,215
[Kourtney] What do you guys think?

228
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,651
I'm, like, I just really,
really wanna have fun

229
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,319
with my sisters, though.

230
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,821
[Kris] I'll babysit Scott.

231
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,223
-I'm just saying--
-I'll be his nanny.

232
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,225
Is he gonna be… Like, do I have to worry

233
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,493
if he's drinking?

234
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,464
Okay, but if he's there,
he's there with his kids,

235
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,832
having a good time.

236
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,634
I think Scott should come, poor guy.

237
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,437
[Kourtney] Scott and I, on family trips,

238
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,040
have definitely had some issues.

239
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,010
You're starting to drink a little bit more

240
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,045
-and a little bit more.
-Don't worry about me.

241
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,079
Like, do you just write down

242
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,247
-all the reasons…
-Oh, my god.

243
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,715
-…to pick at Scott every day?
-So annoying.

244
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,018
[Scott] Yeah, I don't wanna be here.
I literally hate this thing.

245
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,720
I don't wanna have to be worried.

246
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,789
[Kourtney]
I just wanna have fun with the kids.

247
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,990
Like, have a great time.

248
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,792
[Kim] I would just say, do it.

249
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,261
Especially, like, maybe
Rob will feel more comfortable

250
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,329
if he ever goes.

Don't use that word
in front of my daughter, please.

255
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,545
Okay.
[Kris laughs]

256
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,680
[Kourtney] My son,

257
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,081
he uses that word all day.

258
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,082
-Really?
-It's what he calls

259
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,350
the paparazzi.

260
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,520
I just wanna know
if Scott's definitely coming

261
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,654
on the family trip.

262
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,956
[Kourtney] I don't know.

263
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,558
I just wanna have fun without having

264
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,493
to worry about,

Is T coming or not? Has anyone decided?

[Kris] He's not gonna come
if Rob's coming.

268
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,305
If Tyga does come on the family trip,

269
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,541
there's definitely more of a chance

270
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,876
of Scott just going crazy.

271
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,778
Hanging out with somebody that, like,

272
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,649
brings out certain behaviors in you,

273
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,818
like, is also a scary thing.

274
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,988
I just remember how sad last time was

275
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,223
when he saw all of us having a good time

276
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,458
on the family vacation.

277
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,893
That's called consequences
to your actions.

278
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,595
But I still felt bad.

If you wanted to come on the family trip,

290
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,789
but you just need
to keep it together, dude,

291

00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,579
[Kris] Ain't that good? Look at the…

511
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,047
Look at the ice skating rink.

512
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,182
-[Mason] Mommy.
-[Kourtney] Yes?

513
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,383
Isn't that great?

514
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,720
[knocking on door]

515
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,288
[knocking continues]

516
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,990
[Kris] Why don't you go answer the door?

517
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,057
Hurry up.

518
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,559
-Someone's here, you guys.
-[knocking continues]

519
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,627
-Knock, knock…
-[Kris] Who is here?

520
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,529
Somebody's knocking on the door.

521
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:28,133
I have so many memories
of Vail back in the day.

522
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,869
And I have another surprise
for the kids at the door.

523
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,338
And I cannot wait to see their reaction.

524
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,174
[Khloé] What's happening?

525
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,241
[door opens]

526
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,413
-[Sheila] Surprise!
-[all cheering, clamoring]

527
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,149
[Khloé] Oh, my god!

528
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,851
{\an8}-Hi.
-[Kendall] Hi. How are you?

529
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,288
Oh, my god!

530
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,622
Ooh!

531
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,025
{\an8}[Kendall] How are you?

532
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,260
-I'm so happy you're here.
-Oh, my god.

533
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,228
{\an8}[Corey] How you doing?

534
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,763
{\an8}-Yo, baby.
-It's nice to see you.

535
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,264
{\an8}-[Todd] Great to see you.
-[Randy] Kris.

536
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,566
-Hey!
-Aw!

537
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,569
Every single trip
that the kids ever took to Vail

538
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,103
on these wonderful vacations,

539
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,139
they went with the Kolkers
and the Kraines,

540
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,675
so I thought what an amazing surprise

541
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,476
if I invited them on the trip

542
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,513
and we could all share a reunion together.

543
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,881
{\an8}-Now that you're here--
-Oh, we're doing this

544
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,217
{\an8}-20 years later, you know?
-[laughing]

545
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,885
{\an8}This is the 20-year reunion.

546
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,420
Before you were born.

547
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,788
{\an8}Yeah, I was gonna say I wasn't part of it.

548
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,856
-They don't, like, get it.
-No, you were not, but…

549
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,725
{\an8}-They don't get it.
-We used to come up with,

550
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,895
with Robert every single year.

551
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,330
They tell me all the time.

552
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,032
[Kim] Will you say,
"Hi, Auntie Kris, it's me."

553
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,235
-Yes, Scott, you got to do it.
-Yeah, you got to.

554
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,636
-Come on.
-Go on, Scott.

555
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,837
-Come on.
-You got it.

556
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,972
What do you want me to do?

557
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,740
[Kim] Just say, "It's me, Todd Kraines,"

558
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,376
and then I'm gonna go,
"And the real Todd Kraines."

559
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,445
-Come on. Okay, you ready?
-[Scott] Yeah, I'm ready.

560
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,813
[Kim] One, two, three.

561
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,484
Auntie Kris, it's me! It's Todd Kraines!

562
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,519
Oh, you better believe it.

563
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,388
You know, a long time ago,

564
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,223
when we started prank calling Kris

565
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,259
with the whole Todd Kraines thing,

566
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,394
I never even knew who the person was.

567
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,329
And then it became,
like, an on-going joke.

568
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,031
[Kourtney] We need to call right now.

569
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,132
[line rings]

570
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,668
-[Kris on phone] <i>Hello?</i>
-Auntie Kris, it's me.

571
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,271
It's Todd Kraines. Where are you?

572
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,772
[Kris] <i>Stop calling this number.</i>

573
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,541
-Let's do a Todd Kraines prank.
-[blows air]

574
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,910
-Come on, Todd Kraines it up.
-It's me!

575
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,746
[Scott] It's Todd Kraines.

576
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,147
[Kraines] Surprise!

577
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,182
Auntie Kris, it's me. Todd Kraines.

578
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,918
It's me. It's Todd Kraines.

579
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,454
-Auntie Kris, it's me.
-[laughter]

580
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,989
[Scott] <i>But I never thought
I'd actually, like,</i>

581
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,424
go on a ski trip with him.

582
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,493
[laughter]

583
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,096
[Scott] <i>Auntie Kris, it's me.
It's Todd Kraines.</i>

584
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,666
[Kris] Okay, so, I wanted
to show you guys this.

585
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,600
-[Todd] Oh, wow.
-Aw…

586
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,403
I put together a little
walk down memory lane

587
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,604
for you guys.

588
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,738
[Todd] Oh, wow.

589
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,240
-[Kris] Look at you all…
-Oh, my god.

590
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,542
-Look. Look at your mom…
-Look at the hair.

591
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,411
-You're gonna make me cry.
-Who that?

592
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,881
When we were, like, 14 and 15,

593
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,416
we used to always say

594
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,885
when we're older
and we have families and kids,

595
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,952
we can never break

596
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,587
this tradition of coming to Vail.

597
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,656
We have to come with our kids.

598
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,992
[Kim] And so, the fact that my mom
made that happen for us,

599
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,360
it's such a cool thing

600
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,295
that we're carrying on this tradition.

601
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,331
-Look at this, baby Rob.
-[Kourtney] Me and Lindsey.

602
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,999
I can't believe Rob isn't here.

603
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,834
-Aw, we miss him so much.
-I know. I know.

604
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,103
Uh, that is the ugliest picture
I've ever seen of me.

605
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,938
[laughter, chattering]

606
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,807
[upbeat music]

607
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,649
[Mason] Let's touch the snow!

608
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,851
Guys, stick a little closer there.

609
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,453
[Scott] Mase…

610
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,689
[Kourtney] Look at the river.

611
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,725
-[Penelope] I can't see it.
-Look.

612
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,927
You know, when Mom was little,

613
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,730
I took my Christmas card picture
here with my daddy.

614
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,899
[Kourtney] We stood on the bridge
and we took a picture

615
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,469
with Uncle Bob and KoKo and KiKi.

616
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,770
[kids clamoring]

617
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,038
{\an8}[laughter]

618
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,540
{\an8}My best friend surprised me…

619
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,543
{\an8}-Hi.
-…and is on our family vacation.

620
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,114
Mason, let's see
if you're okay over there.

621
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,252
Mason, let's put our foot in the snow.

622
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,320
[Scott] Just for a minute, let her,

623
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,955
so she can touch the snow like you did.

624
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,556
I think the one thing

625
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,892
I wanna really get out
of this trip is that

626
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,261
we can go places together

627
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,664
and be a family even though
we're not dating or together.

628
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,533
[Mason] To make the biggest snowball.

629
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,368
[Scott] And I just want

630
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,971
her to see that I'm fine.

631
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,105
[Kourtney] Let's go.

632
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,006
[Kraines] All right, let's go, girls.

633
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,242
-[kids chuckle]
-[groans]

634
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,309
[Scott] All right, Kourt,
I'm gonna go check

635
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,245
-into my hotel.
-[Kourtney] Okay.

636
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,782
[lively music]

637
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,389
[Khloé] <i>Ye, do you ski?</i>

638
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,525
-[Kanye] I mean, I do ski…
-[Khloé] Not today?

639
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,060
I just feel like
I'm about to die every moment.

640
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,228
[indistinct chatter]

641
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,596
[Kim] Go show Daddy your boots, North.

642
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,764
Oh, those are cool!

643
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,132
[Kourtney] Zoe's on her way here.

644
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,567
Are your boots so heavy?

645
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,769
Are these boots so heavy?

646
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,605
[Kim] I grew up skiing and Kanye didn't.

647
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:04,075
And it's so fun having, like,
Kanye be so excited,

648
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,545
and we're teaching
our little girl how to ski,

649
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,414
and you know, it really is crazy.

650
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,583
It's, like, I've envisioned this
since I was little

651
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,618
of having these memories with my family,

652
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,353
and the fact that it's all happening

653
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,488
is really special to me.

654
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,557
[Khloé] We all made it.

655
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,293
[Kanye] It's so hard to walk
in those, right?

656
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,161
-[Khloé] Yeah.
-[Kris] Hold my hand.

657
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,563
[Kourtney] Does that fit, Mase?

658
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,032
[Scott] Kourt, what are…
Are we gonna watch the kids or what?

659
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah, let's watch them
for a sec and then go.

660
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,702
We're gonna ski this way.

661
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,471
We're gonna… Let's go this way.

662
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,239
[Kourtney] You're doing it, Mase!

663
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,942
Whoo-hoo!

664
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,443
You ready?

665
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,045
[instructor] Go, put your arms out.

666
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,413
Arms out for Dad.

667
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,149
-[Scott laughing]
-Whee!

668
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,917
-Are we going?
-Wow.

669
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,986
-[Kourtney] Yeah, let's go.
-[Kris] You did it.

670
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,288
-Bye, P!
-Wait, wait. Tell my mom!

671
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,556
[Kourtney] Bye, Mase!

672
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,125
[Scott] All right,
we're not leaving them forever.

673
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,194
Bye, guys. Bye! Bye!

674
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,230
[Khloé] You'll probably
never gonna see them again.

675
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,332
[Scott] Oh, P, bye!

676
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,800
You think it was like Titanic,

677
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,702
and they were getting
on, like, the little boat.

678
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,904
[Khloé] Kanye's a really good dad.

679
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,106
Kanye has great family morals

680
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,075
and how he always wants us together.

681
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,409
-Yeah, totally.
-Like…

682
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,879
Probably even wants us, like,
in the studio with him or, like,

683
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:14,946
it's good, just like,

684
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,615
-I love that.
-Yeah, me too.

685
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,817
It's not at all
how I ever imagined he would be.

686
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,520
You don't know when someone has kids.

687
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:22,787
Yeah, totally.

688
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,657
And he has, like, surprised me
for the best.

689
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,559
[Kanye] Where you wanna go, Northy?

690
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,793
Where are you going?

691
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,830
You gonna make a snow angel like Daddy?

692
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:33,965
Here.

693
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,268
[Kanye chuckles]

694
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,703
[Kris] Oh, I need a picture.

695
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,706
Oh, is that too cute?

696
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,508
[chuckles]

697
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:44,976
[Kanye] You gonna help me up?

698
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,512
{\an8}Ah, so much snow.

699
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,314
{\an8}Ah, it's snowing, it's snowing.

700
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,682
{\an8}-[North laughs]
-It's snowing.

701
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,884
{\an8}-[Kris laughs]
-[Kanye] I love you, Northy.

702
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,753
-[Khloé] Oh, where'd it go?
-Coming down!

703
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,323
[electronic music]

704
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:22,314
We used to yell "Cowabunga"
the whole time skiing.

705
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,381
I'll yell it with you.

706
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,950
'Cause Ninja Turtles were cool.

707
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,952
Oh, good. Well, Mason can do that now.

708
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:27,852
[Kourtney chuckles]

709
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,422
Whoo! Woo-hoo!

710
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,961
[upbeat music]

711
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,032
{\an8}[Kris] <i>Okay, who wants to go
to Sweet Basil?</i>

712
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,402
Hi, boo… Oh!

713
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,604
Yeah.

714
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,871
These hats are everything.

715
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,473
-Where'd you get these hats?
-You look so cool, Mom.

716
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,908
-Thank you.
-[Kendall] Khloé's.

717
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,310
This outfit is from 1985.

718
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,745
-[both] Is it actually?
-Yeah.

719
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,313
-Was it yours?
-[Kris] Yeah.

720
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,581
I cannot button the pants.

721
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,682
-[Kendall] You are so cool.
-Wait.

722
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:58,750
You can't tell.

723
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,619
-Oh!
-[laughter]

724
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,888
Mom, you look like
Elton John or something.

725
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,423
-[laughs]
-Oh.

726
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,758
[Kris] Let's go, we're gonna walk.

727
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,159
Don't eat any more.

728
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,696
Sweet Basil
is an amazing restaurant in Vail

729
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,065
and it's one of the places
that we would come to

730
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,234
every single time we would come to Vail.

731
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,970
And the kids continued
to go there through the years,

732
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,739
and I think it'll be a great memory.

733
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,175
[Kendall] <i>Kourt, where's Scott?</i>

734
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,543
[Kourtney] <i>He's coming.</i>

735
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,045
[Sophia] Cheers, babe.

736
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:28,546
There he is.

737
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,517
Hey. Hey! Want to say hi to your dad?

738
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,320
[Kourtney] Oh, boy.

739
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,989
Oh, my god, look at them
taking selfies, you guys.

740
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,190
Look at them taking selfies together.

741
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,960
Yeah. I think, I think they're,
like, a little bit crushing.

742
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,763
Scott's been great on this trip so far,

743
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,032
but I'm definitely a little nervous

744
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,968
because I know how
out of control things can get.

745
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,637
[Kim] Why don't we do a toast?

746
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,509
Thank you, Mom,
for bringing us all to Vail,

747
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:00,679
our favorite, most memorable place

748
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:01,846
in the world,

749
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,083
and surprising us
with the Kraines and the Kolkers

750
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,118
and making it old-school,

751
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,621
just like my dad would've wanted.

752
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,922
Thank you, Mom,
for putting this all together.

753
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,457
-I love you, guys.
-[Kim] Love you.

754
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,059
-Cheers.
-Cheers, everybody.

755
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,094
[Kris] Thank you, everyone,
for being here.

756
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,296
[indistinct chatter]

757
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,732
[Khloé] Let's call… Rob.

758
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,833
-[line rings]
-Oh, look,

759
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,702
he's gonna answer you. Say "Hi, Bob."

760
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:24,903
{\an8}Hi, Bob.

761
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,104
[Rob] <i>Hi, P!</i>

762
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,106
-Oh, Rob!
-Oh!

763
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,442
-We're at Sweet Basil.
-[Corey] Sweet Basil.

764
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,377
[Rob] <i>Are you drinking?
What are you drinking?</i>

765
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,945
-[Kraines] Tell him I said hi.
-Red wine.

766
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,447
-Red wine.
-Red wine.

767
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,583
-Bobby.
-And here's Todd Kraines.

768
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,752
-[Randy] Can I… Can I say hello?
-Todd Kraines.

769
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,387
-[Sheila] Can we say hello?
-And Uncle Randy.

770
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,788
-We miss you.
-Pull it.

771
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,357
-Give it to Kanye.
-Just hop on a plane.

772
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,792
We need you down here.

773
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,694
-Get over here.
-[Kim] You need to come.

774
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,930
-I need to give you a big hug.
-It's our family vacation.

775
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,032
[Todd] Come on. I'm serious.

776
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,768
{\an8}-We have a whole room for you.
-Hi, Bob.

777
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,070
[Kendall] I miss you.

778
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,572
[Rob] <i>I miss you.</i>

779
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,943
Rob, I think, definitely has some things

780
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,611
that he has to work out.

781
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,913
We've always been such a close family,

782
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,250
so it's just a different dynamic
when he's not around.

783
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,418
[Kim] It's just kind of sad.

784
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,054
We like him to, you know,
have all these memories

785
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:17,255
and live in the moment with us.

786
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,556
[Kylie] …later.

787
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:19,724
<i>Love you.</i>

788
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,534
{\an8}[fan] Hello, Kim!

789
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,337
Hi, guys.

790
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:33,938
[fans chattering]

791
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,874
-Right here.
-[Kris] Oh, right here.

792
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,643
Oh, my favorite.

793
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,312
This is a place
that I used to take my kids

794
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,114
every time we went to Vail,

795
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,917
so it's really special
because I took my kids,

796
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,419
and now my kids are taking their kids

797
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,955
and we can have these same memories

798
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,023
with all the grandkids.

799
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,825
[Khloé] Do you want one of these cones?

800
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,728
-Or you want one of these cones?
-Or should we put it in a cup?

801
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,963
-Or in a cup?
-[Kris] Oh, my god.

802
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,133
This is, like, my favorite place
in the world.

803
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,340
[Kris] Do you guys have the sea foam,

804
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,575
-like a…
-[woman] Yes.

805
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,210
Ah! Beautiful.

806
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,646
What did North get?

807
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,381
-You want ice cream?
-Yeah.

808
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,483
-[Kourtney] How do you like it?
-[Mason] I love this.

809
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,285
Kind of amazing.

810
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,820
-[Kris] Thank you so much.
-[woman] You're welcome.

811
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,221
Thank you.

812
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,156
-[Kourtney] Thanks, Mom.
-[Kris] Love you, guys.

813
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,026
[light upbeat music]

814
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,467
P said to me, "I don't like skiing."

815
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,169
-[Kourtney] Really?
-I said, "Why not?"

816
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,270
Her feet hurt.

817
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,673
And it does, it hurts my feet.

818
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,274
It's really not, like,

819
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,310
"this is the best feeling in the world."

820
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,379
I don't get people
who wanna ski by themselves, like…

821
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:49,914
That, like, love it.

822
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,183
I do. Like, I could've skied at the one…

823
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,586
Once we got down, we were like,
"Should we go back up?"

824
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,854
Oh, no. I… After lunch,

825
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,189
I was like, "Uh-uh. I got it. I'm done."

826
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,091
-[Khloé] I'm tired.
-Like, I was so ready for more.

827
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,693
[Kourtney] I just love it.

828
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,163
[Khloé] Have you spoken
to Kylie or Kendall?

829
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,698
[Kourtney] No, I haven't. Why?

830
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,434
No, I just didn't know
if you spoke to them.

831
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,936
I guess, like, T's coming on the trip.

832
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,572
I thought he wasn't coming.

833
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,642
I just don't know what that means,

834
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,644
like, for Scott.

835
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,813
Like, I don't want Tyga here, though.

836
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,582
Yeah, but you can't put…
I've told you a million times,

837
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,718
as much as I would like
to blame other people

838
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:30,054
for what Lamar's done
in his past, you can't.

839
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,490
Like, they still make their own decisions.

840
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,393
Totally. And I can't control people,
nor do I want to.

841
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,295
I'm just saying I'm not gonna lie

842
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,698
and say that it doesn't
concern me that, like…

843
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,634
That Scott's gonna, like, spiral.

844
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,204
[Kourtney] Yeah, and just when we're here
on vacation with the kids.

845
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,775
Tyga is in our family.

846
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,410
-Totally.
-And so is Scott.

847
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,412
Yeah.

848
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,180
Like, we're gonna have to come to some…

849
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,317
understanding.

850
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,720
[Khloé] I do get why Kourtney is nervous

851
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,355
because she doesn't want Scott

852
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,324
to wanna go ahead and, like, rage.

853
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:11,062
But it's not Tyga's fault
if Scott wants to rage.

854
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,598
Like, Scott needs to know
how to control himself

855
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,166
and be an adult.

856
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,035
Like, let's hold Scott accountable

857
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,269
for Scott's actions.

20 hours later.

Tyga is on break from his tour,

873
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,047
so I invited him out

874
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,350
to experience all this with me.

875
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,417
It's just nice,

876
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,785
and I just hope that

877
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,821
there's no tension
between him and Kourtney.

878
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,423
I made you spaghetti and garlic.

879
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,492
-[Tyga] That's very nice.
-Really?

[Kourtney] Can we go downstairs?

887
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,984
Kylie told me that she talked to T

888
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,321
about how I feel about him and Scott

889
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,324
and now Tyga wants to talk to me about it.

I feel like, you think I'm,
like, the bad guy all the time.

[Kourtney] Yeah.

892
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,400
[tense music]

893
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,735
{\an8}-[Tyga] <i>Can we talk?</i>
-[Kourtney] <i>Yeah.</i>

894
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,338
[Tyga] I just wanted to,
like, you know, like,

895
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,073
pull you to the side and really, like,

896
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,474
clear up everything, you know what I mean?

897
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,542
[Kourtney] Yeah.

898
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,145
'Cause I feel like, you think
I'm the bad guy all the time.

899
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,747
I just felt like when I was hearing,

900
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,683
you know, a million stories, like--

901
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,052
-"T and Scott, T and Scott."
-Yeah.

902
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,354
-Yeah. Mm.
-Um, you know.

903
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,388
And I was just like,

904
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,791
"He has three kids, he's, like, a father.

905
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,559
Like, what are you guys doing?"

906
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,094
Yeah.

907
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,096
But I feel like with me around, like,

908
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,864
it's way better because, like,

909
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,666
I'm actually a friend that he values

910
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,801
and actually listens to,

911
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,235
but at the same time, like,

912
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,504
he still has to make a decision as a man.

913
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,373
-Yeah.
-You know?

914
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,311
Yeah, it's just like
when there's responsibilities…

915
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,146
-For sure.
-…or for example, like,

916
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,181
when I was hearing, like,

917
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,049
more serious things, like in Vegas,

918
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,452
or, you know, like, back at home

919
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,887
and I was starting to get
really, like, pissed at you.

920
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:50,888
-And I'm like…
-It was a point…

921
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,757
It was a point where it was
really, like, bad, you know?

922
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:53,991
-Yeah.
-And I was kind of worried,

923
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,494
and I was really around him
like every day, you know,

924
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,695
but I feel like…

925
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,499
I feel like I helped him realize what…

926
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,301
more what's important too, you know?

927
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,670
Right. And I don't know
'cause I'm not there.

928
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:06,737
Right.

929
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,240
So, I tend to, like, shift the blame

930
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,908
-on other people.
-For sure.

931
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,479
It isn't my concern
what Scott is doing now,

932
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,581
but he is still the father of my kids,

933
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,517
and I want him to be the best
that he can be.

934
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,153
[Kourtney]
And so, I think it's reassuring to hear

935
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,755
that Tyga wants the best for him as well.

936
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:28,292
Maybe he is looking out
for Scott more than I think.

937
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,429
And I really can't blame Tyga
at the end of the day.

938
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,031
Yeah, he came a long way,
he's doing a lot better.

939
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,099
A lot better.

940
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,135
-It seems that way.
-Yeah.

941
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,338
-Well, glad we talked.
-This bacon is really good.

942
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:43,474
-Is it turkey bacon or regular?
-No, this is turkey bacon.

943
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,511
It's all right though.

944
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,913

But I can't stop thinking
about my brother.

He's the one piece
of this puzzle that's missing,

993

and I really wish he was here
'cause he would love this trip.

994
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,844
Pick a [bleep] card.

995
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,246
Shut the [bleep] up!

996
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,581

[Khloé] Rob is just a [bleep] pussy.

1003
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,770
He proposed in front of her whole family.

1004
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,473
She said, "He proposed
in front of her whole family

1005
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,141
at her house last night."

1006
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,476
So he's engaged to Black Chyna.

1007
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,144
And you don't even tell your sisters?

1008
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,649
We wake up to all of these pictures

1009

of my brother just getting engaged.

1010
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,091
I'm just like, "Is this real?"
Like, "What's going on?"

1011
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,160
Like, "How do we tell my mom?
Has she seen it?"

1012
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,629
So, all these group chats are going on.

1013
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,831
Everyone's calling us asking if it's true

1014
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,533
and we just don't know.

1015
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,235
How does our own brother not tell us?

1016
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,971

00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,148
at dinner last night.

1020
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,284
That's so [bleep] up that he did that.

1021
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,953
My feelings are hurt
just that he doesn't feel like

1022
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,422
he could talk to me about that

1023
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,324
or just, like, like, I was…

1024
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,793
He was so involved
with me and like, Lamar.

1025
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,028
I just find it weird he won't ever, like…

1026
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,397
He acts like it's two different lives.

1027
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,367
Like, he doesn't even give me
a chance, and I…

1028
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,369
That's what hurts my feelings. I'm like…

1029
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,638
We've all said, "Okay, do your thing, Rob,

1030
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:03,140
but just don't get her pregnant
or get married."

1031
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:06,043
I mean, that's it, you can't
tell him something like that.

1032
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,246
[Khloé] This is ridiculous.
I told Malika and she cried.

1033
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,615
[Kourtney] I just need to think
of what I'm gonna say.

1034
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,751
I think I'll say something
like… Well, let's see if he…

1035
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,386
[Khloé] Well, we don't know anything yet.

1036
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,620
He hasn't told us anything.

1037
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,089
That's the truth.

1038
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,658
And I'm not gonna cover for him anymore.

1039
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,793
I'm not gonna be, like,
"Oh, we're one big happy family."

1040
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,994
If someone asks me,
I'll say, "I don't know.

1041
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,663
I haven't spoken to him.
He hasn't told me."

1042
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,131
I'm not lying anymore.

1043
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,799
What am I lying for?

1044
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,701
I've been covering for him for how long?

1045
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,703
No.

1046
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,405
[Kim] I don't care if he tells me.

1047
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,809
At all. I have not said
one word, I could care less.

1048
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,478
I truly could care less.

1049
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,879
[Kourtney] But you obviously could.

1050
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,782
I woke up to 170 text messages
this morning.

1051
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,150
[Kim] Did I start the text message chain?

1052
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:50,221
I saw it, did I send one,
did I initiate anything?

1053
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,756
[Kourtney] I'm just saying, who cares?

1054
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,890
[Khloé] But come on.

1055
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,426
[Kourtney] I just don't give
a flying [bleep].

1056
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,660
[Khloé] But you don't think
it's [bleep] up

1057
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,962
that your brother doesn't tell us?

1058
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,197
Like, yeah, Kim might've
gotten married fast,

1059
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,632
-or we got married…
-[Kourtney] Maybe he feels that

1060
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,668
you guys are judgmental,
which clearly you are.

1061
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,971
Because we're not… Hello, we at least

1062
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,439
-involved everybody…
-Just be happy that [bleep]

1063
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,508
he's been exiting the house.

1064
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,910
It's not our [bleep] decision.

1065
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,613
I said, "It's God's plan, it's not yours."

1066
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,251
My brother is the happiest
I've seen him in a long time,

1067
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,019
and I just hope that, like,

1068
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,388
everything is genuine and sincere,

1069
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,724
and, like, that's all we can hope.

1070
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,025
It's not up to us.

1071
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,762
So why cause any tension or add any drama,

1072
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,631
like, we should just be happy for them.

1073
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,833
-It definitely…
-But I'm not being a bitch.

1074
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,701
[Kim] Like, I haven't even said
anything to him,

1075
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,969
how I feel about him,

1076
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,138
and how I think he's, like, a lunatic.

1077
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,206
[Kourtney] That's nice.

1078
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,008
And that's exactly why he didn't tell you

1079
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:45,709
'cause you're a [bleep] bitch.

1080
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,514
We all are reacting differently
to this news, and as we should.

1081
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,350
[Khloé] He never mentioned anything,
not even, like,

1082
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,386
an inkling that this was about to happen.

1083
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,855
Finding out on social media leaves

1084
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,356
a really bad taste in my mouth.

1085
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,892
All of us have always wanted
the best for him.

1086
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:05,329
Now that Rob has figured out
where his happy is,

1087
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,865
instead of sharing that with his family,

1088
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:11,502
he's, like, pushing us more away
and he just keeps doing things

1089
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:15,239
to keep this divide between us,
which I find disturbing.

1090
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,974
{\an8}It's almost like
there's someone in his ear

1091
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,210
{\an8}giving him all this information

1092
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,878
that he should stay away from us,

1093
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,413
and I can't handle it.

1094
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,581
That's [bleep] up.

1095
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,484
[upbeat music]

1096
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,354
-[Kim] <i>Coming up next week…</i>
-[Sheila] You all right?

1097
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,490
-Rob got engaged.
-Stop.

1098
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:34,992
I, I think I'm just in shock.

1099
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,794
He has not spoken to any of us.

1100
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,430
He must legitimately hate
our whole family.

1101
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,501
[Khloé] Oh, yeah.

1102
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,903
I know Kourt had a ton of anxiety,

1103
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,073
but I could see those nerves
are completely leaving her.

1104
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,709
There's no loyalty
or family unity with him.

1105
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:55,279
Other people know more
about our family than we know.
