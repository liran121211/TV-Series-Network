{\an8}-[Khloé] Hi, Mom.
-Hi.

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,407
{\an8}[Kris] This is so great.

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,609
{\an8}Lamar's recovery has been a miracle.

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,911
{\an8}<i>He is now getting out of the hospital</i>

5
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,080
{\an8}<i>and he is able to move into his own home.</i>

6
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:17,083
{\an8}[Kris] This is such a great space.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,918
{\an8}[Khloé] I got these texts from Caitlyn.

8
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,354
{\an8}She tells me to get a life and to shut up.

9
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,390
{\an8}I'm like, "You shut up
and you get a [bleep] life."

10
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:27,160
{\an8}[Caitlyn on phone] <i>You don't go on
Howard Stern and call me a liar.</i>

11
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,230
{\an8}You were her dad
since she was five years old.

12
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,664
{\an8}So tell me about you.

13
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,300
{\an8}I'm a 32-year-old man that lives alone.

14
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,669
{\an8}-[Scott] We'll see where things go.
-[Kris] Where's Scott?

15
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,872
{\an8}[Kourtney]
Scott and Tyga have been hanging out

16
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,441
{\an8}at his house. All day and night.

17
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,680
{\an8}[upbeat music]

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,784
[Kourtney]
It pisses me off that people like Tyga,

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,419
who should know better,

20
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,155
that are close to our family,

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,058
that don't just, like,
find some other friends.

22
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,262
It's not like Kanye's
calling him and saying,

23
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,064
"Come to the studio," every night,

24
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,865
"Come to my show," you know?

25
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,002
It's Tyga calling him
to hang out and go to parties.

26
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,070
[Kris] Yeah.

27
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,073
I think Kourtney has to accept the fact

28
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,208
that it's really Scott
that she should be mad at,

29
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,445
and she can't keep putting
the blame on other people.

30
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,346
[Kourtney] So, it just…

31
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,415
-It still bothers me.
-Yeah.

32
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:29,656
You guys, Baby Yeezys
are gonna be launched in August.

33
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,391
-The black ones and the…
-[Khloé] Oh, my god, how cute.

34
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,460
…like, original blue and cream mix.

35
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,461
[Kim] And so I was like,

36
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,029
"Well, have you guys thought about pink?"

37
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,931
-So, "You guys are gonna be…
-I think pink would be so cute.

38
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,332
…wearing them all in the show?"

39
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,167
"The new ones in the show?"

40
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,938
Kanye is having
his Yeezy Season Three fashion show

41
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,172
at Madison Square Garden.

42
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,509
<i>Kanye really wants the whole family there,
and I do too.</i>

43
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,377
And I think it's really cool
that he's opening up

44
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,713
a fashion show to the public,

45
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,548
<i>which has never been done before.</i>

46
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,718
So I can't wait for all of us to go
and just have a good time.

47
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,987
[Kris] I was thinking
about getting a private plane

48
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,422
on Monday morning.

49
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,591
-[Kourtney] I'm going with Kim on Tuesday.
-Honey, we got a plane.

{\an8}Hold on. You wanna say hi
to Kylie and Kourt?

Hi, Lam.

[Lamar] <i>It was good. I ran
on the treadmill for 10 minutes today.</i>

No, you didn't.

That's so good.

You're gonna need that jacket there.

-And it's all about just,

leave Lam, and, like, I have <i>Kocktails--</i>

00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,190

bring Lamar to New York.

Like, he has not been in public yet.

or been around people.

Like, it's just way more anxiety for me,

114
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,808
I think, than for anybody else.

<i>New York is

[sighs]
It's a lot.

120
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,990
When I was sitting there
with him at his house,

121
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,692
he was like, "Honestly,

122
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,261
like, Kanye's music,
like, helped me so much.

123
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,929
Like, that's when I realized, like, okay,

124
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,998
I could start, like, thinking again

125
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,633
and things were coming back to me

126
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,702
and I could start, like, articulating it."

127
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,472
[Khloé] He loves that. He's always, like,

128
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,508
"Ah, Kanye saved me."

129
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,410
That's so sweet.

130
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,712
[Kim] <i>There was a moment when Lamar</i>

131
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,847
couldn't really express himself

132
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,215
and he couldn't really talk,

133
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,950
<i>but he could hear
what we were saying to him.</i>

134
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,487
And Kanye really felt, like,
we can cure him through music,

135
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,588
like, we can get him to talk.

136
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,290
<i>He would go to the hospital,</i>

137
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,125
<i>and he would, like, rap and sing.</i>

138
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,728
<i>And I think Lamar started
to get his, like, function back</i>

139
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,796
<i>and started to talk,</i>

140
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,898
<i>once he started to listen
to a lot of music.</i>

141
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,033
[Khloé] You're doing so well.

142

Good job.

143
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,639
I think Lamar wants to go
and support Kanye,

144
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,607
and this will be just

145
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,110
such a powerful moment for them, I think.

146
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,312
But, like, what's the plan?

147
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,014
[Kim]
Like, shouldn't he get out at some point?

148
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,616
[Khloé] No. I mean, I'm doing <i>Kocktails</i>
because I wasn't planning on going.

149
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,085
[Kim] Well, see if he even wants to go.

150
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,690
[upbeat music]

151
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,397
[Kylie] How's your app going and stuff?

152
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,599
[Kourtney] Good, I think.

153
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,735
[Kylie] How's Scott?

154
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,937
I don't think he's been okay lately.

155
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,774
After his hanging out with Tyga
and all that.

156
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,444
So, I almost wanna, like, call Tyga

157
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,881
and just literally go off on him.

158
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,217
I have a tendency to, like,

159
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,686
shift some blame from, like, Scott

160
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,389
onto the people that are around him,

161
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,023
to where, like, I'm never be able

162
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,092
to be cool with you again. So…

163
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,028
[Kylie] I mean…

164
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,732
I don't know about going off on him

165
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,200
'cause he's really sensitive.

166
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,505
[Kylie] <i>I know Kourtney gets mad
at Tyga sometimes.</i>

167
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,206
But Tyga always feels like

168
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,809
he's in the middle of Scott and Kourtney.

169
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,945
I think I should just say, like,

170
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,747
"Do you ever think about how your actions,

171
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,215

174
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,594
{\an8}[Malika] What's up?

175
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,998
Wait, please, please,
I like my toes licked but not by dogs.

176
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,400
I hate when she does that too.

177
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,903
{\an8}You wanna like it, but you're like,
"You're a dog. Ugh."

178
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,439
No, because she has a soft tongue too.

179
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,573
Babe, you got a good tongue.

180
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,941
-[Khloé] Yeah, it's bizarre.
-I'm just saying.

181
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,242
[dog whines]

182
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,911
I think you should get Lamar a dog.

183
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,179
-Not a puppy.
-No, no, no.

184
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,147
He doesn't need to take care of anything.

185
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,017
It just needs to be, like, a companion.

186
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:35,521
So, obviously,
Kanye's fashion show is, like, known,

187
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,290
and the whole family
keeps talking about it

188
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:38,524
and talking about it.

189
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,326
And I was never planning on going.

190
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,228
-Who's gonna watch Lamar?
-[Khloé] Exactly.

191
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,530
So then Kim was like,
"Well, why don't you bring Lamar?"

192
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,399
And I was like, "Bring Lamar?"

193
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:52,038
And, mind you, I just found out
that it's for, like, 14,000 people.

194
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,207
It's just a lot to handle no matter what.

195
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,477
[Malika] It is very natural for you
to be protective.

196
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:01,547
You should be, but you also have to let
the reins go a little bit,

197
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,082
to see how he's progressing.

198
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,750
You won't know that until you try.

199
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,386
Yeah, of course. But Lamar's…

200
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,889
It's like when you're starving
and you go to a restaurant,

201
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,891
don't you order way more
than you could eat?

202
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,926
His eyes are bigger
than his stomach right now.

203
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,561
[Khloé] I'm just trying to protect him.

204
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,663
[Malika] I'm thinking on the other side is

205
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,565
think about what his life has been like.

206
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,733
He's been very secluded.

207
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,201
I think it's time.

208
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,836
I actually agree with Kim.

209
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,239
[Khloé] <i>I am really overprotective,</i>

210
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,941
and I know how much Lamar wants
to go to New York.

211
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,343
<i>But, still, I'm scared,</i>

212
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,211
'cause I don't know how Lamar's
gonna handle the situation.

213
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,315
I really just have to decide
what I think is best…

214
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,352
for Lam at the end of the day.

215
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,992
[upbeat music]

216
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,764
{\an8}[Kim] Hello.

217
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,132
{\an8}[Kris] Hi.

218
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,600
I've had, like, a headache

219
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,169
since the middle of the night last night.

220
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,738
It's really weird.

221
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,974
[Kris] Did you hear
that Scott has an appearance

222
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,743
at 1 Oak in New York while we're there?

223
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,344
[Kim] Yeah, so he called me

224
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,413
because he wanted a ride on the plane.

225
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,949
So I was, like, "Yeah, for sure, come."
And then, like,

226
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,885
you know, I can maybe, like,
hang out with him, keep an eye on him,

227
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,655
just, like, help him with, like, sobriety.

228
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,725
If we're hanging out,
he's not gonna, like, be wasted.

229
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,160
-Yeah.
-And I'm like, "We'll all hang out

230
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,963
and go to dinner when we land,
and, like, be busy,"

231
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,766
so that he's not, you know,
in, like, party mode.

232
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,334
Yeah.

233
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,736
He did say he wanted to go
to the fashion show,

234
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,038
-so…
-Oh, good.

235
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,707
[Kim] <i>You know, it was really important
for us to invite Scott</i>

236
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,376
because I want him to feel like
if he needs to feel busy,

237
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,378
<i>that it's with us instead of partying</i>

238
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,448
<i>and resorting back to maybe,
like, unhealthy behavior.</i>

239
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,551
So I wanna invite him
to all the things that we're doing.

-Oh.

-Maybe not your head at that angle.

-No, you can be on your phone.

-I know.
-Finally.

-No. I haven't spoken to her.

we need to have a girl's dinner

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,498
[indistinct chatter]

339
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,799
-With my house?
-[Caitlyn] Yeah.

340
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,135
Oh, oh, oh. Where's Scott?

341
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,070
He's here.

342
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,939
-He's at the hotel.
-[Kris] Where?

343
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,474
-Doing what?
-Hanging out.

344
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,544
[Kourtney]
Kim has invited him to every single thing.

345
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,246
She's, like, "Do you wanna come
to the album thing?

346
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,316
Do you wanna…" I already…
I wrote Kim days ago and said,

347
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,319
"No Tyga, no Scott at the show."

348
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,321
-[Jonathan] She invited both.
-Of course.

349
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,756
[all laughing]

350
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,658
But Kim's, like, "What do you care?

351
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,694
Just invite Scott to stuff

352
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,897
if it's gonna, like,
keep him out of trouble.

353
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,533
Better him hanging out
with all of us than…

354
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,702
-[Jonathan] Getting into…
-Whatever."

355
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,471
-There's no rhyme or reason at this point.
-[Kourtney] So… Yeah.

356
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,107
[Jonathan]
If he wants to be in trouble, he will be.

357
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,508
Exactly.

358
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,111
[Kourtney]
<i>Kim may have the best intentions,</i>

359
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,046
<i>but that doesn't mean
that it's going to go</i>

360
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,649
<i>the way that she's thinking it's gonna go.</i>

361
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,185
And I'm really just hoping
that there's no drama

362
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,455
because we're really there
to support Kanye.

363
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,258
Hey, you want to go to the bathroom?

364
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,325
I think I'm good.

365
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,294
-[Kourtney] I have to go to the bathroom.
-Okay. Let's go.

366
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,395
[Caitlyn chuckles]

367
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,498
You guys know that I've peed
in the Delano lobby.

368
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,499
-[Jonathan] When?
-[Kris] I've heard this story

369
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,768
a million times,
and I wouldn't keep repeating it.

370
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,405
And I peed in my BMW
because I had seven ice teas.

371
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,474
{\an8}[Kris] No wonder you couldn't sell it.

372
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,245
{\an8}[upbeat music]

373
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,618
How was therapy today?

374
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,320
Good.

375
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,656
You're just chilling, right?

376
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,691
You're… You don't have anxiety. Only I do.

377
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,760
Great.

378
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,795
[light music]

379
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,665
I've decided to go to New York with Lamar

380
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,600
<i>'cause I think this is
something he truly wants to do,</i>

381
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,036
and at the end of the day,
I want Lamar to be happy.

382
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,705
<i>I still feel
a ton of anxiety and pressure,</i>

383
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,675
but if this makes him happy,
and if I could keep him safe,

384
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,543
then that's a match made in heaven.

385
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,246
{\an8}[Kim]
<i>Just relax. I got the perfect outfit.</i>

386
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,748
{\an8}<i>-I've got it custom-made for you, okay?</i>
-Thank you.

387
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,517
-[Kim] <i>Okay, relax. Calm down.</i>
-He said thank you.

388
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,421
{\an8}-<i>Have fun. Okay. I got to go.</i>
-[Khloé] Okay. Love you. Bye.

389
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,555
{\an8}[Kim] <i>Bye.</i>

390
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,725
I'm nervous. Like, this is nerve-racking.
You haven't been in public ever.

391
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,027
I have more anxiety than you do, I'm sure,

392
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,163
but it's because I don't think
you understand.

393
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:05,998
I can understand.

394
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,933
[Khloé] I know. I know you wanna go.

395
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,803
I know all that, but it's a lot.
That's all I'm saying.

396
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,538

<i>Oh, my god, I miss being in New York.</i>

399
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,315
Knock, knock.

[knock on door]

[Caitlyn] Whew.

402
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,086
-[Caitlyn] Look at that.
-You know La La.

403
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,220
-Oh, yes. How are you doing?
-Oh, hi.

404
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,722
Good to see you.

405
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:30,990
{\an8}-How are you?
-It's so nice to see you.

406
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,158
{\an8}-[Caitlyn] Nice to see you. Hey, baby.
-[Kim] Hi.

407
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,760
It is hot in here.

408
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,195
Well, after Christmas,

409
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,696
it's so good that you're here in New York

410
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,831
so you have all these coats

411
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,766
-you can actually wear.
-[Kim] I know. I know.

412
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,301
That's what… I was just telling La La.

413
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,470
She asked where I got this,
and I was like,

414
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,238
"One of my Christmas presents."

415
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,806
-Yeah.
-[Kim] You look nice.

416
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,676
Well, thank you.
How's the show coming along?

417
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,644
[Kim] Really good, really hectic.

418
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,279
Lamar's coming into town.

419
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,281
-Right.
-[Kim] Isn't that exciting?

420
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,050
[Caitlyn] Extraordinarily exciting.

421
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,818
[Kim]
Her husband played with him for years.

422
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,353
-Yeah, right.
-[La La] Yeah, he was.

423
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,757
He saw something on the news about you,

424
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,493
and he was a little confused,
so I had to, like, explain it to him.

425
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,529
I was like, "Well, it's Caitlyn now."
And he was like, "What?"

426
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,732
I know Khloé tried to explain it to him
a couple of times,

427
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,101
but at that point, I don't think
he was getting anything.

428
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,470
[Kim]
Yeah. Have you talked to Khloé at all?

429
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,739
She hasn't been talking to me lately.

430
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:21,840
[Kim] I know. I was gonna say,

431
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,243
-didn't you guys get into a big fight?
-I know. Yeah.

432
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,744
[tense music]

433
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,346
[Kim] <i>This is a really big week.</i>

434
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,016
<i>Lamar's already dealing with the pressure
of being in an environment where there's</i>

435
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,351
a lot of people.

436
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,521
And this is, you know,
it might be really difficult for him.

437
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,257
<i>And Khloé and Caitlyn are
kind of on the outs.</i>

438
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,026
<i>So everyone has to put
our differences aside</i>

439
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,695
for this week and just be cool.

440
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,765
She called me a liar with Howard Stern.

441
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,234
[Caitlyn] I didn't lie to anybody.

442
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,104
I hope Khloé will spend some time with me.

443
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,773
And she didn't reach out to me at all
at that time either.

444
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,475
-I mean…
-And she has a big hang-up

445
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,043
that "she's the kid,"

446
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,845
so the adult should reach out to the kid,

447
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,780
or you're the one transitioning,

448
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,882
so you should have reached out to her.

449
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,818
It's just how she feels.

450
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,887
I just hope that Caitlyn and Khloé

451
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,056
get a chance to move past the drama

452
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,859
<i>because otherwise,
it could just be a disaster.</i>

453
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,394
[Kim] It's not wrong or right,

454
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,564
but I just think that, like,
at some point, talk to Khloé.

455
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,004

456
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,144

-[Kourtney] Yeah.

460
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,651

Kourtney got, like, ambushed by Tyga

461
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,221
{\an8}and, like, five other men
who came around her

462
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,922
and were like, "I hope there's not beef."

463
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:44,957
And Kourtney was like,

464
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,893
"No, we're fine. We're not fine,
but we are fine."

465
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,098
Tyga's been hanging out with Scott.
They've been going to clubs together.

-[Jonathan] Hi. Hi.
-Yeah. Hi.

467
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,203
-Hollywood.
-Why Hollywood?

468
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,506
-[Simon] What did you get to drink?
-[Kourtney] I don't know.

469
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,876
{\an8}-I might just have a beer.
-Whoa. It's that time?

00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,584
-At the hotel.
-[Jonathan] Oh, why doesn't he hang out?

474
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,787
When is he staying till? Tell me
just so I know when the misery ends.

I'm not sure.

478
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,728

"Can we watch a movie? Can we hang out?"

480
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,832
And he's like, "If I hang out with you
then I won't go out."

00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,536

00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,822
All the white people will.
The black people will know.

504
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,990
[chuckles]

505
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,626
-[Khloé] Kim.
-[Kim] Yeah?

506
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:32,564
Uh, one thing, Lam is really nervous
about meeting Caitlyn.

507
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,168
[Kim] Well, I had a whole talk
with Caitlyn yesterday about it.

508
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,803
-[Khloé] About Lam?
-And I was just like,

509
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,472
"You know, you have to, like,
take it in baby steps."

510
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,107
Like, he… I don't know.

511
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,609
You know,
he could definitely comprehend it.

512
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,479
[Kim] But, you know, he might not be able
to grasp it all at once.

513
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,782
He said to me the other day,
"Bruce", something.

514
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,353
And I had to say there is
no Bruce anymore, it's Caitlyn.

515
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,625
[Khloé] After our New York fight,
we, like, have not spoken.

516
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,560
[tense music]

517
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,996
I don't really care
to see Caitlyn right now

518
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,464
<i>because the last time
me and Caitlyn spoke,</i>

519
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,799
we were fighting over text.

520
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,835

521
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,470

522
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,971
I feel very overwhelmed.

523
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,108

-Yes, ma'am.
-Ready.

-As ready as I'm gonna be.

<i>I am so excited that Khloé and Lamar
pulled through and came to New York.</i>

536
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,774
I really think
that Lamar's gonna enjoy being out,

537
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,477
and it'll make him feel
super normal again.

538

[Khloé] Yeah, Lam,
check yourself out in that mirror.

-Actually, great.
-That's good.

543
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,659

You're going out with that?

550

No, I'm just doing it on purpose, just to…

551
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,140
Why would I give them a shot?

552
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,011
I can't even think right now.
I'm stressing out. I can tell.

-Ready?

probably playing in a basketball game.

I'm always going to love Caitlyn.

839
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,935
We might not see eye to eye all the time,

840
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,538
or any of the time, but,

841
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,007
<i>I know Caitlyn loves me.</i>

842
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,543
<i>We're family. I think that's
what family does best.</i>

843
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,779
We go up and down, and…

844
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,481
But we are still always gonna be there
for one another.

845
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,583
[Caitlyn]
So happy to see you there tonight.

846
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,751
-Thank you.
-It's just like…

847
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,453
I was crying the whole time.

848
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,554
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

849
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,524
[electronic music]

850
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,930
[Kourtney] You know what's crazy?

851
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,001
Just, we were saying,
can you believe Lamar is here?

852
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,503
-When we left you in the hospital…
-Mm-hm.

853
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,571
in Vegas,

854
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,607
we didn't think we would see you again.

855
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,876
[somber music]

856
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,447
And we were hysterically crying
on the airplane.

857
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,616
We couldn't even talk.

858
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,620
Can you believe that from that moment…

859
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,955
-Till now.
-…like, we've gotten here…

860
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,156
Mm-hm.

861
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,726
…to where you're
at this huge Madison Square Garden

862
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,563
-with, like, 30,000 people?
-Yeah.

863
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,232
[Khloé] Like, screaming
when you walked through the door too.

864
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,768
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-[Khloé] That's major.

865
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:07,138
I swear that people's prayers for you,

866
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,473
-like, saved your life.
-Mm-hm.

867
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,807
Like, the world

868
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,676
-praying for you…
-Mm-hm. Yeah.

869
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,778
-I agree.
-…saved your life.

870
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,884
It's a great question, Kourt.

871
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,954
Yeah.

872
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,856
[Khloé] Do you appreciate everything,

873
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,424
-you think?
-I do.

874
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,793
Wait. But you never had, like, a moment

875
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,496
where you saw heaven and stuff like that?

876
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,397
[Lamar sighs]

877
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:38,703
No, I kept having real dreams,
in-depth dreams.

878
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,439
[Kourtney] With people you know and stuff?

879
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,407
Some people that have passed on.

880
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,443
-Oh, really?
-I think he went to heaven

881
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,278
from the conversations he has with me.

882
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,412
Yeah.

883
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,649
And since they told me
he was basically dead.

884
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,685
[chuckles]

885
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,356
Maybe those people were just with you.

886
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,458
{\an8}I mean, that's what it is.

887
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,626
Yeah.

888
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,763
-Telling you to stay.
-Talking to you and…

889
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,231
[sniffs]
That's what it is.

890
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:10,501
[upbeat music]

891
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,113
[Jonathan] It's so peaceful in here,
I could fall asleep.

892
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,815
This lighting is amazing.
I'm literally, like…

893
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,053
{\an8}[Kim] Ugh. I can't believe
Scott has not texted me back.

894
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,721
Where is he? How have I not seen him

895
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:31,856
-one day this week?
-[Simon] He's psychotic.

896
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,292
So first of all,
whole entire plane flight,

897
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,861
he's like, "I'm coming, I'm excited."

898
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,696
And then, he was at the hotel
the first night,

899
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:39,830
and he asked Kourtney
to hang out with him.

900
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:40,898
And Kourtney's like, "I'm in New York."

901
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,166
-"I wanna go see my friends."
-Right.

902
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,634
-[Jonathan] But he went out that night.
-[Kim] So…

903
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,102
-So I guess he went out.
-[Simon] He went out that night.

904
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,204
With his guy friends.

905
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,074
[Kim] I was, like, "Don't drink, be good.
Remember what we talked about."

906
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,709
So then, yesterday,
he never wrote me back.

907
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,678
I go, "Okay, are you rested?"

908
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:57,114
"Because you're gonna look so handsome
at the show next to Kourt."

909
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,151
Nothing. Never wrote me back.

910
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,587
-Just nothing?
-[Kim] He's just MIA.

911
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,388
[Simon] He went out that night,
the night before the show.

912
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,023
Jake's cousin saw him at Up&amp;Down.

913
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,392
My friend saw him at 1 Oak last night too.

914
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:11,529
[Simon] I just don't understand why Scott,
like, doesn't wanna make his life better.

915
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,663
-Yeah.
-[Jonathan] He's got everything.

916
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,232
-You couldn't ask for anything more.
-[Simon] Everything.

917
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,299
[Jonathan] It's, like, amazing.

918
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,735
But he said
he's not happy inside, you know?

919
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,337
[indistinct chatter]

920
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,339
[Kim] <i>I can only do so much for Scott.</i>

921
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,574
I can't control him
and I'm not gonna try to.

922
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,676
<i>You can try so hard to help people,</i>

923
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,578
but you really can't change them.

924
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:30,848
<i>It's easier, sometimes,
just to sit back, be supportive,</i>

925
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,650
<i>but let them do what they wanna do.</i>

926
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,452
He just needs to figure this out
on his own.

927
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,887
-It's so sad.
-It's dark.

928
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,856
[indistinct chatter]

929
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,492
[upbeat music]

930
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,030
Yeah.

931
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,366
[Caitlyn]
Ooh. Borrowing all the magazines?

932
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,501
Oh, these are my interior design ones.

933
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,536
[Caitlyn] No flying magazines?

934
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,405
-Like, airplane stuff?
-[Kris] Oh.

935
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,874
No, but there's a safety card here
you can read.

936
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,078
[Khloé] <i>I really wanted to, like, mend</i>

937
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,181
that bridge with Caitlyn
and extend the olive branch

938
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,051
and invite her on the plane
back to LA with us.

939
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,886
[Lamar] How long was I in the coma?

940
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,921
[Khloé] You were in a coma for four days.

941
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,723
Lam sees a hearse and says,

942
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,892
"Was I supposed to be
in one of those?" But, like…

943
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,161
[serene music]

944
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,629
-Yeah.
-No.

945
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,565
-No, I mean, he was--
-God is good.

946
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,968
{\an8}-[Lamar] God is great.
-God is good but I kind of want him

947
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,336
to be a little more free.

948
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,672
[serene music continues]

949
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,607
You're very rare.

950
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:33,044
Like, bad things can happen
if you go back to that life.

951
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,081
-You know, like I was talking about it.
-This is, like, a second chance

952
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,182
-for life.
-Yeah.

953
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,486
[Lamar] The last time I came to New York,

954
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,622
my cousin was killed.

955
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:48,993
And then the day after that,
I got into a car accident…

956
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,261
[Khloé] Yeah.

957
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,397
-…and that kid died in front of me.
-[Khloé] Yeah.

958
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:54,699
So I do.

959
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,935
There's a thin line
between life and death.

960
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,637
[Khloé] Yeah.

961
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,173
-[Caitlyn] How are you doing?
-[Lamar] Good.

962
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,644
Thanks to this lovely young lady.

963
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,045
[Khloé chuckles]

964
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:10,014
[Caitlyn]
Well, she certainly was there for you.

965
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,482
-[Lamar] Yeah.
-Yeah.

966
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,253
Khloé was showing me some pictures.

967
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,424
Of when I was in the hospital.
Let me see the pictures?

968
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,193
[emotional music]

969
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,599
[Khloé] October 14th.

970
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,703
<i>To get to a hospital and hear</i>

971
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,439
that someone has four hours to live

972
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,908
<i>and there's nothing you can really do,</i>

973
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:38,843
it's horrible.

974
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,745
[emotional music continues]

975
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,480
<i>Lamar wasn't able to walk.</i>

976
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,181
He had no facial recognition.

977
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,384
He did not know people's names.

978
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,720
[Khloé] But now Lam is walking perfectly.

979
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,323
High five.

980
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,393
Person who wasn't walking
a month and a half ago.

981
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,230
[Caitlyn] Into Madison Square Garden.

982
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,732
Into Madison Square Garden, baby.

983
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,503
[Lamar] I gotta get back out there
with a ball in my hand.

984
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,606
[Khloé]
<i>When something as tragic as this happens,</i>

985
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,274
it does make you hold onto life

986
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,709
<i>and think about things.</i>

987
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,843
You're more in the moment

988
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,213
and you don't take things for granted
as much as, maybe, you once did.

989
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,550
Isn't my friend Melanie nice?

990
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,420
The best.

991
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:23,888
[Khloé laughs]
Melanie Griffith?

992
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:26,223
[Kris] She married Don Johnson twice.

993
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,291
She did?

994
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,493
If you're lucky, that could be you, Lamar.

995
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,762
-[Kris] Okay?
-Yeah. If you're lucky.

996
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,764
[Kourtney]
Wait, why did she marry him twice?

997
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:34,832
Because they got a divorce

998
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,001
and then they decided
they shouldn't be divorced.

999
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:41,872
If you guys ever got married,
can we just skip the wedding part?

1000
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,707
No.

1001
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,075
[Khloé] Oh. I was gonna say "sure."

1002
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,710
But we're definitely
getting out of this marriage,

1003
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,446
'cause it's been a little tainted.

1004
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,681
{\an8}Call… call if you hear me.

1005
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,050
{\an8}[all laughing]

1006
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,251
Just sayin', okay.

1007
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:55,886
[Khloé]
I'm just saying we need to cut our ties

1008
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,755
and we can figure it back out.

1009
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,257
-You know?
-Agreed.

1010
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,829
[Kim] <i>On the next episode…</i>

1011
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,465
Did you hear that Rob bought a house?

1012
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,233
Yeah, Khloé's kind of, like, freaked.

1013
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,434
[Kris] It's his money.

1014
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:11,569
[Khloé] It's not his money

1015
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,770
-'cause I know--
-Yes, it is.

1016
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,506
I'm just allergic to [bleep]. Oh.

1017
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,441
-[Rob] Yo.
-[Kris] Welcome home.

1018
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,710
[Kourtney] Can I just say
I don't like this rug in here?

1019
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,879
-[Kris] Okay.
-[Kourtney] Let's remove the stuff…

1020
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,681
Kourtney's just, like, taking over.

1021
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,717
I just feel like they had worked
so hard all day

1022
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,052
-and we were just trying to--
-What do you want me to do,

1023
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,119
come over and lie?
