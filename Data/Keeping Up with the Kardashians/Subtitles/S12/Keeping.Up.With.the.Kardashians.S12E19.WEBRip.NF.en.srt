[Kourtney] I'm so excited for Miami.

00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,483
When are we going
to get good Miami outfits?

4
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:18,351
I know. I need some good outfits.

5
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,553
I should see if Monica can come this week.

-[Khloé] No, I'm texting Monica.
-No, no, no,

7
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,724
but I'm leaving before you.

8
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,293
[Khloé] Hey, Moni, I'm going to Miami

00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,130
for a full Kardashian extravaganza,

10
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:34,701

How does your thing work?

-[Kourtney] Hi.

14
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,542
Exclamation.
[chuckles]

15
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,110
You say exclamation point.

[Kourtney] Monica, exclamation point.

Nope.

21
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,756
[Khloé] It can't read tone.

22
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,491
It just reads your words.

23

[Kourtney] I leave town for three weeks.

24

this hill and down by herself."

Going into this whole tea party…
sounds okay.

{\an8}-[Scott] Hi. How you doing?
-[Kyle] What's happening?

165
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,837
At least put your sunglasses on
so we're chic.

166
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,538
Oh, are you supposed to wear
sunglasses here?

167
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,140
[Kris] Well, when you're having tea.

168
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,808
-Really? Okay.
-Honestly, I don't know.

00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,544
I'll take mine off.
But you should leave yours on.

170
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,114
I try to see my girlfriends
every week or so.

171
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,051
We're always hanging out,
and why not invite Scott?

172
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,452
He's the life of the party.

173
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,689
So, Kylie just went to a new gynecologist,

174
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,790
-and he said to her.
-Oh, awesome.

175
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,091
I can't wait to hear about this.

176
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,459
-That's right.
-[Scott] I didn't think…

177
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,361
Let's talk about
all of your daughters' vaginas.

178
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,332
[Kris] You have to learn
how to take care of your body.

179
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,833
-As a female, it's a lot different…
-Scott--

180
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,901
…than when you're a male.

181
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,005
Is this comfortable, this table?

182
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,573
That's why it's called

183
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,008
-"high tea".
-[Scott] It goes low into me.

184
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,744
-Get it?
-No, it's crushing my tea.

185
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,480
[Kris] So what else?

186
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,782
{\an8}You have some gossip for us?

187
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,350
{\an8}[Scott] I wish I did. I have nothing.

188
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,153
[Kris] If you're gonna come to tea,
you have to have really good gossip.

189
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,088
-Okay, so…
-[Kris] Did you sell your house?

190
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,123
-No.
-Rob was looking for a house one time,

191
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,293
and I got really mad
because Rob didn't like the house I liked.

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,828
I said, "Well, this is just [bleep]."

193
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,763
She literally wants to buy everything.

194
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,998
-It's unbelievable.
-[chuckles]

195
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,100
If I send her anything, she's like,

196
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,902
"Oh, my god, that's so amazing.
Is there two of them?"

197
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,171
[laughter]

198
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,439
[Kyle] I feel like
we should do a girl's trip.

199
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,673
[Kris] Definitely, or…

200
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,141
-Nice. I'll be there.
-Girl's trip.

201
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,976
-[Kris] Nice.
-[laughter]

202
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,778
I was a little nervous coming into this,

203
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,981
but everybody's so nice
and so not intimidating.

204
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,018
And I feel like I'm definitely
getting along even better

205
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,953
than I thought with all of her friends.

206
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,388
-[waiter] Arnold Palmers?
-Right here…

207
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,590
for our other girlfriend, Scott.

208
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,058
[laughter]

209
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,360
-That's what I'm here for.
-[Kyle] I know.

210
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,864
But I will say, I really admire
hanging out with you guys

211
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,799
because it's not all about texting

212
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,768
-and being on your phones.
-[laughter]

213
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,836
But it's beautiful.

214
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,537
Like, I actually get to listen
and hear things.

215
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,406
-[Kyle] We're old school.
-I need to get to this meeting.

216
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,540
I love you guys…

217
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,542
[Kyle] Next time we're gonna
have more gossip for you.

218
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,777
-[Faye] Definitely.
-[Scott] Yeah, I love it.

219
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,978
-See you soon.
-[Kris] Love you, Scott.

220
00:07:59,045 --> 00:07:59,979
Can't wait to plan the trip

221
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,814
-to Mexico for all of us.
-Are you coming?

222
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,882
-[Kyle] We're going to Punta Mita.
-What do you mean?

223
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,417
Somebody's got to supervise.

224
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,785
Yeah, he's definitely coming with us.

225
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,120
-[Kyle] We do need an escort.
-Well, or a pool boy.

226
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,922
[laughter]

227
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
[upbeat music]

228
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,901
-[camera shutter clicking]
-[Russell] Beautiful, Kendall.

229
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,270
{\an8}Gorgeous. Beautiful, Kendall.

230
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,106
Very strong. Beautiful.

231
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,774
Bring the legs out.

232
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,142
Yes, beautiful.

233
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,115
[line ringing]

234
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,184
{\an8}[Kris] <i>Hey, Kendall.</i>

235
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,486
{\an8}Hey, Mom.

236
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,888
[Kendall] What are you doing?

237
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,556
[Kris] <i>Gonna go into a couple of meetings.</i>

238
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,458
Oh, okay. Um…

239
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,393
[Kendall] Do you want to know
the craziest thing?

240
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,462
So have you ever had sleep paralysis?

241
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,163
-[Kris] <i>What does that mean?</i>
-I don't know.

242
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,632
It's like you wake up,
and your brain is aw--

243
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,201
Like your mind is awake,
but your body's still asleep,

244
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,270
so you can't move. Like, you just wake up,

245
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,105
-and you're fully paralyzed.
-[Kris] <i>That's terrible.</i>

246
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,206
Terrifying.

247
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,208
You feel like
you're never gonna move again.

248
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,577
[Kendall] I'm freaking out
because recently,

249
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,445
I wake up in the middle
of the night and I can't move.

250
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:07,880
I looked it up online,

251
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:11,884
and it's a weird thing
called sleep paralysis.

252
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,052
It's so scary when it happens.

253
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,121
You literally feel like you're
never gonna get out of it.

254
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,023
[Kendall] It mainly happens on planes.

255
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,659
[Kris] <i>I think you've just got
incredible anxiety</i>

256
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,327
-<i>about traveling.</i>
-Yeah.

257
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,461
[Kris] <i>You know?</i>

258
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,565
<i>And you can't have a fear
of getting on a plane</i>

259
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,867
<i>because of your anxiety attacks.</i>

260
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,335
-But it's…
-[Kris] <i>Yeah, you gotta… </i>

261
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,470
No, no, I'm done arguing with people

262
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,073
because everyone says
I'm fine, but I don't feel fine.

263
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,274
And I promise you, one day,

264
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,877
when I'm rushed to the hospital,
then you guys are gonna wake up,

265
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,011
because I promise you this is not--

266
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,181
[Kris] <i>Kendall, I believe you.</i>

267
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,717
[Kendall] Okay.

268
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,988
[Kris] <i>I don't want you to live
with this anxious feeling</i>

269
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,191
-<i>all the time. That's terrible.</i>
-Yeah, and I'm kind of freaking out.

270
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,027
It's so weird, 'cause I get,
like, super light-headed…

271
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,130
when I'm on planes too.
And I feel like I'm gonna faint.

272
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,832
-[Kris] <i>Yeah.</i>
-[Kendall] I don't know what to do,

273
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,034
'cause I'm, like, freaking out
about even flying home.

274
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,004
[Kris] <i>All right, just take a deep breath.</i>

275
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,408
{\an8}[upbeat music]

276
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,818
{\an8}[Scott] What is going on here?

277
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,186
{\an8}[Kris] Hi, Scott.

278
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,521
{\an8}-Hello.
-We're doing water aerobics.

279
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,823
{\an8}And would love for you to join.

280
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,124
{\an8}[Scott] Um…

281
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,028
Initially, when Kris asked me
if I wanted to come over

282
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:29,962
and swim in the pool,

283
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,597
you know, I thought, no big deal.

284
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,332
I didn't really think
it was gonna be, like,

285
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,067
water aerobics.

286
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,535
[Kris] We're just getting started.

287
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:37,570
[Scott] All right.

288
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,139
It's a little weird,
and I definitely don't know

289
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,674
what I've gotten myself into.

290
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,443
{\an8}I'm Tracy, and I was told
that you guys love it hard.

291
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,512
{\an8}-[Lisa] Yeah, oh, yeah, we do.
-What?

292
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,680
-Yeah, we do.
-We do?

293
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,583
[Tracy] If you don't like it hard,
what's gonna happen is you're going to…

294
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,418
turn a little blue, it's gonna be good.

295
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,320
Hey, Scott, why don't you be,
like, the… leader.

296
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,721
[Lisa] I want to look at you from behind.

297
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,123
-[all cheering]
-Yes.

298
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,658
I think there's enough going on,
I don't need

299
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,459
-to be in the middle.
-[Tracy] Everybody ready?

300
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,594
-Yeah.
-[Lisa] Yes.

301
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,029
Close your eyes and feel it.

302
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,197
-[Scott] Oh, wow.
-Reverse.

303
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,199
[Kris] Scott's into it.

304
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,669
[Tracy] Three, four.

305
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,538
-Okey dokey.
-[Tracy] Five, come on, six.

306
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,407
Out your mouth, push it.

307
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,409
-[Scott] Oh, god.
-[Tracy whoops]

308
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,843
-[woman] Is it your…
-Roll, Scott,

309
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,712
-come on, roll.
-[Tracy] Give me your hips.

310
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,946
[chuckles]

311
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,748
You know…

312
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,651
[Scotts] Pretty sure I have no idea
what's, uh, happening.

313
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,721
I mean, it's a little bit of a weird life
that I lead here.

314
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,156
I don't think this is for guys.

315
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,957
-Come on.
-[laughter]

316
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,626
This is like a stripper class.

317
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,162
You could give somebody
a lap dance when this is over.

318
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,730
[Tracy] This is all for your tight tush.

319
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,031
Squeeze, nice and tight.

320
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,766
Scott, either you're gonna
do it or you're not.

321
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,202
[Scott] I didn't know
water aerobics was this sexual.

322
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,870
Two, get back to thrust.

323
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,140
[Tracy whoops]
Thrust, thrust, thrust, thrust.

324
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,809
I just don't know
if it's the most appropriate thing

325
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,712
in the world to be half-naked
with Kourtney's mom

326
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,914
and all of her friends
doing all these weird,

327
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,283
exotic dance moves
that you'd see in a strip club.

328
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,618
It's a little embarrassing,
I'm not gonna lie.

329
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,921
Squeeze your butt cheeks like
you're holding a credit card.

330
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,689
[Tracy] Shake it out,
come on, booty rolls.

331
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,591
-[Tracy whoops]
-[Heather] Do you care if I pee a little?

332
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,393
-[Tracy] No peeing in the pool.
-[laughter]

333
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,329
[Heather] Well, I'm trying to hold it
while you're doing the jumping jacks.

334
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,198
I have had two kids.

335
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,234
[upbeat music]

336
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,208
{\an8}[Kris] Come do a selfie with me.

337
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,043
{\an8}-No.
-[Kris] You never do selfies with me.

338
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,312
One day, when I'm not here
you're gonna regret it…

339
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,180
-I hate selfies.
-… because it's gonna be like,

340
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,151
"I wish I had a picture of me and my mom
doing selfies in the kitchen."

341
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,385
-Wait.
-I feel like I just took

342
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,554
-a picture with a fan.
-Okay. I am a fan.

343
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,058
I actually like these,
will you send 'em to me?

344
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,326
[squeals]
My hair.

345
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,595
-You can send 'em to yourself.
-Wait, let's take more.

346
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,929
Oh, whoa.

347
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,232
-This is a new world for me.
-[camera shutter clicking]

348
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,768
Get it, Kendall.

349
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,770
[Kendall] I'm gonna caption it
"Pictures with fans."

350
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,471
[Kris] I'm your biggest fan.

351
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,808
-Mm. Since when?
-You're my favorite.

352
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,143
[sighs]

353
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,411
[Kris] Do you want
to go over your schedule?

354
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,480
[Kendall] I mean, I guess.

355
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,117
You have a week in Paris,
Milan, and then London.

356
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,187
I… I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to do that.

357
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,658
Well, you're already booked
to do that, honey.

358
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,293
I can't travel that much.

359
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,295
-Well…
-[Kendall] I'm, like, scared.

360
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,364
I'm freaking out because of these…

361
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,099
[bleep] paralysis things.

362
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,269
I'm scared to fall asleep
because it keeps happening to me.

363
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,738
It's almost like…
it almost feels like my heart stops.

364
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,208
Okay.

365
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,178
The nature of what you do for a living

366
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,114
and your career is flying
around the world.

367
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,349
You have designers
that have already booked you

368
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,418
and are counting on you to show up.

369
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,786
I'm just telling you…

370
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,156
I think that my health is a bigger deal.

371
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,793
[Kris] Kendall basically lives
on an airplane.

372
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,596
So, the anxiety on an airplane

373
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,400
and the sleep paralysis is a huge problem.

374
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:58,804
Sometimes, it's been so bad
that she's been paralyzed

375
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,539
from even getting on an airplane.

376
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,541
[Kendall] <i>I want to get off the plane.</i>

377
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,009
[Kris] Kendall, don't cry.

378
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,581
And I've had to get on a plane,
fly from LA to London

379
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,916
just to get her from London to New York.

380
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,252
So, it's becoming a real problem.

381
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,289
It's genuinely frightening
and I don't know how much of it I can do.

382
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,163
{\an8}[upbeat music]

383
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,040
{\an8}[Kim] What a life changer
that you got rid of the camel…

384
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,010
-Yeah, but I'm not sure if I like it.
-[Kim] … drapes.

385
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,546
I love it. This makes it, like, chicer.

386
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,883
They couldn't be this camel color
with the lines in them.

387
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,319
-You liked it all?
-Well, I mean, it was just…

388
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,154
it was easy and it looked finished, but…

389
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,423
-I mean, it looks clean.
-All of that was here when I moved in.

390
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,158
[Kim] It looks cleaner, a little brighter.

391
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,361
It's not like you really need
to black this room out,

392
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,229
-so it doesn't really matter.
-[Kim] Yeah.

393
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:02,301
So, Scott, why on earth
are you hanging out with my mom,

394
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,703
going to tea parties
and doing water aerobics?

395
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,605
First of all, it wasn't a tea party.

396
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,108
-[Kim] It was a tea party.
-It was "high tea."

397
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,044
-Was Lisa Miles there?
-A tea party…

398
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,779
[Scott] No, Lisa was at water aerobics.

399
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,981
Lisa wasn't at high tea, she was busy.

400
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,417
She texted me for your number today.

401
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:23,355
Like, since when were you interested
in water aerobics?

402
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,757
[Kim] Yeah, that's a little odd.

403
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,526
You never worked out a day in your life
since I met you.

404
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,497
The only difference
between them and all of you

405
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,598
is they don't sit on their phones

406
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,699
-the whole time.
-Saggier skin?

407
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,335
-[laughs]
-Their skin's a drop saggier.

408
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,304
It's just so not like you.

409
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,707
Just not your, like, steez.

410
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,411
I knew this whole water aerobics thing
was gonna come back and haunt me.

411
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,614
I mean, I didn't want to be, like
a full-blown cougar stalker.

412
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,116
It's definitely not the most normal thing
on the planet.

413
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,485
So maybe I shouldn't hang out
with the cougar squad.

414
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,587
[Kourtney] I don't want you to feel bad.

415
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,989
[Scott] I think you do.

416
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:02,795
I was just interested
in what exactly goes down.

417
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,631
I don't know, listen,
I mean, we talked about…

418
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,466
Menopause. I'm just kidding.

419
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,034

Tonight, I am going
to the launch of Skyspace LA,

423
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,883
and I'm super excited to go.

424
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,752
It's really nice to have this event here,

425
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,288
just 'cause I don't have to travel alone.

426
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,858
[crowd cheering]

427
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:37,663
Hello, everybody,
and welcome to OUE Skyspace LA.

428
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,100
I am so excited to be here.
I brought all my friends out

429
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,668
and we are gonna ride this slide,

430
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,771
and we are so excited
for Travis Scott to perform.

431
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,674
And, yeah, I just hope
everyone has an amazing time.

432
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,744
[cheering and applause]

433
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,213
-[Kendall] I'm shaking.
-You were perfect.

434
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,681
You did it.

435
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,850
-[Kendall] We're getting on the slide.
-[Kim] I can't.

436
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,586
[Kim] Go now. Kendall!

437
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,355
-[Kendall squeals]
-Kendall!

438
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,291
I'm coming!
[screams]

439
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,760
I hate it, I hate…

440
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,662
-I got you going down, Kendall.
-I did it!

441
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,565
Very proud.

442
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,401
I'm really glad to just spend some time

443
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,869
with Kendall at her event.

444
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,339
We both travel so much,
but she has a few days here in LA,

445
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,175
so I'm glad to just be here
and watch her do her thing.

446
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,544
[Kim] Pretty view.

447
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,546
[Kendall] God, I'm so tired.

448
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:28,814
[Kim] You are?

449
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,916
-What's been going on?
-[Kendall] This stupid

450
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,719
sleep paralysis thing is,
like, really getting to me.

451
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,255
-[Kim] Sleep paralysis?
-[Carla] What is that?

452
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,924
It's, like, you're asleep and then, like,
the middle of the night…

453
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,228
basically your mind wakes up
but your body's still asleep.

454
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,864
So, like, you wake up,
but nothing can move.

455
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,200
-You can't speak, nothing.
-Wait, what?

456
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,035
-[Carla] Who's had this?
-[Kendall] Me.

457
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,870
It's the scariest thing
in the entire world.

458
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,205
You literally think
you're never gonna be able to…

459
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,339
[Carla] And you can't
pull your body up, right?

460
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,908
{\an8}[Kendall] You can't do anything.
You're freaking out.

461
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,377
{\an8}Like, 'cause all you wanna do
is be able to move.

462
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,546
So you're laying there
and you're trying to move,

463
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,382
but I think the key is to try and relax.
Nothing.

464
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,286
I mean, I thought I was having anxiety.

465
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,488
This is, like, so much scarier.

466
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,657
I've never heard of sleep paralysis,

467
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,960
and I think it sounds like
such a crazy experience.

468
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,896
And I feel so bad
that she has been going through this.

469
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,833
This is the most chilled out green room.

470
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,434
[Kim] Mm-hm.

471
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,703
[Carla] Go to sleep, Kendall. Take a nap.

472
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,840
Yeah, I only got, like,
two hours of sleep.

473
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,041
[Kim] Me too.

474
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,843
-So annoying.
-[Kim] It's been months living like that.

475
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,644
[Liz] Kim, how do you do that?

476
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,446
-I would die.
-[Kim] I know.

477
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,215
-It's so…
-That's the craziest thing

478
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,050
-I've ever heard.
-[chuckles]

{\an8}-[Kris] Hey, how are you?
-What's happening?

482
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,899
-Good.
-The house looks great.

483
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,801
[Scott] You're just
hanging around in a gown.

484
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,270
I like it. It matches
the tones of the walls.

485
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,939
I wanted to point out,
she said I was kicking her out,

486
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,508
and she made me feel guilty about it.

487
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,675
-Every single time she comes…
-[Scott] It's beautiful here.

488
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,044
Well, don't make me feel guilty.

-[bleep]
-[laughs]

490
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,647
Should we go sit down?

491
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,582
-[Kim] Yeah, we can go over here.
-[Scott] Yeah.

492
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,353
So, you called me the other day
to ask me a question,

493
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,155
and you just seemed very anxious.

494
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,189
Yeah.

495
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,057
[Kris] And I don't know
where it's coming from.

496
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,926
Kendall has got the same thing,

497
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,728
-remember the other day?
-[Scott] She can't get on the plane.

498
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,729
[Kris] She thinks that,

499
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,264
-you know, like, she wakes up…
-[Kim] She told me about it.

500
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,635
It's awful. I mean, I'll never forget
flying to Paris to fly home with her.

501
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,372
It was almost like she jumped on me
and, like, fell asleep cuddling

502
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,041
because she was so happy
to have me there on the plane.

503
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,576
She could finally relax.

504
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,780
So I think that she feels very scared

505
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,584
and not in control of her situation.

506
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,486
And you're feeling not in control.

507
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,922
-[Kris] Emotionally.
-My mind does go crazy.

508
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,457
When you get in your own head, it's scary.

509
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,626
And you don't want to let it get
to the next step,

510
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,461
like, Kendall's at the next step.

511
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,397
-Yeah.
-And that's debilitating,

512
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,966
because she can't do what she needs to do,

513
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,334
and she can't live life.

514
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,235
Yeah.

515
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,306
It's really ironic that Kim and Kendall

516
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,241
are going through similar things.

517
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,044
Maybe there's a way
that they could help each other

518
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,780
manage their anxiety
so that they would feel like

519
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,848
they had the support of one another.

520
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,750
I think that we should find somebody

521
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,954
for you two to talk to so that

522
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,157
this doesn't get bigger
than it already is.

523
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,062

526

{\an8}[Kris] <i>Hey, what happened to you?</i>

527
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,710
[Scott] Um, I had to go
to, like, this closing

528
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,411
for a house that I'm buying.

529
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:51,483
[Kris] <i>Well, it definitely bugged me
that you didn't show up.</i>

530
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,020
Kris asked me if I wanted to come over
and eat with her friends.

531
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,723
You know, I definitely know it's not cool
to flake on anybody,

532
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,226
but I guess I gotta start hanging out
with some people my own age.

533
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,997
[Kris] <i>I had a place for you.
We sat there waiting.</i>

534
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,432
<i>And we were looking forward
to you coming, you know,</i>

535
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,768
<i>it's just manners
to call somebody and say,</i>

536
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,370
<i>"Hey" or, you know, pop me a text</i>

537
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,073
<i>and tell me something came up
because I was counting on it.</i>

538
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,875
[Scott] I mean, I guess
I'll know now for the future.

539
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,512
[Kris] <i>All right, kiddo.
Well, I'll see you soon</i>

540
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,547
-<i>and I love you.</i>
-[Scott] Okay. All right. I love you.

-All right, bye.

{\an8}-[Kim] Do you want a muffin?
-[Kendall] No.

544
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:38,563
[Kim] Um, are you going
to France on, uh, Friday?

545
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,865
[Kendall] I don't know, man.

546
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,834
I'm afraid to, like,
get on a plane. It's so crazy.

547
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,137
I'm, like, supposed to be gone
and, like, traveling.

548
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,471
-And like…
-[Kim] You can do it.

549
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:47,706
[doorbell dings]

[Kim groans]

551
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,981
{\an8}-[Kim] Hi. How are you?
-Hi. I'm good, how are you?

552
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,349
{\an8}-I'm Michelle.
-Good. Hi, I'm Kim.

553
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,318
{\an8}-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

554
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,120
-Here, we can go over here.
-Okay.

555
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,791
My mom found this therapist
who specializes in anxiety.

556
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,327
Since Kendall and I
really aren't therapy people,

557
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,429
I think it's better for us
to do it together

558
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,264
and just see if it helps us.

559
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,833
I mean, I really pride myself in, like,

560
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,302
fully having my [bleep]
together all the time.

561
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,138
And with how bad things are for Kendall,

562
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,107
she has to get this under control.

563
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,742
This is Kendall.

564
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,243
-Kendall, this is Michelle.
-[Kendall and Michelle] Hi.

565
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,912
-Nice to meet you, Michelle.
-How are you?

566
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,680
-I'm good. How are you?
-[Kim] We're anxious.

567
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,615
[Michelle] Well, good thing I'm here.

568
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,852
So I guess I just want to kind
of get to know a little bit

569
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,722
about what typically makes
you guys anxious.

570
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,691
Sometimes, I literally
randomly get panic attacks

571
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,526
-when I'm flying or traveling…
-Mm-hm.

572
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,062
…or by myself. Mainly on planes, though.

573
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,532
Like, I had a crazy panic attack
and I was FaceTiming my mom

574
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,600
crying, like, on the plane.

575
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:52,104
And like, I have weird sleep paralysis
happen to me when I'm on planes now.

576
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,206
And this is all new.
So I'm, like… I don't even know

577
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,540
if there's a way around any of it.

578
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,142
There's not a whole lot you can do,

579
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,911
like, sort of in the moment.
It's kind of riding the wave.

580
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,713
It's more about
sort of preparing yourself.

581
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,115
And so, there's coping skills.

582
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,717
One of my favorite ones is
something called "interoceptive exposure."

583
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,687
Basically, just trying to mimic

584
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,288
the panic attack symptoms

585
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,958
when you're just kind of calm like this.

586
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:13,859
Oh.

587
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,094
[Michelle] The theory behind it is that

588
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,163
if you know what a panic attack is

589
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,566
and you know how to calm yourself down,
you're less likely to have a panic attack

590
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,701
and they're less scary
when you're having them.

591
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,337
Oh, my god, no,
this is so scary. Okay, pass.

592
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,674
I'm not about to, like,
actually… Oh, my god, no.

593
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,846
The therapist is trying to get me
to make a panic attack happen.

594
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,249
But every time I think
about my anxiety at all,

595
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,417
it only makes it worse.

596
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,286
I wanna get this under control,
but not like this.

597
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,526
{\an8}If you know what a panic attack is

598
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,194
and you know how to calm yourself down,

599
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,962
you're less likely to have a panic attack

600
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,831
and they're less scary
when you're having them.

601
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,866
Oh, my god, no,
this is so scary. Okay, pass.

602
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:00,205
I'm not about to, like,
actually… Oh, my god, no.

603
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,442
Just remind yourself when
you're on that plane that it will end.

604
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,610
-You're not dying.
-[Kim] Um…

605
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,246
My anxiety's really different.

606
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,483
Like, if I get in a car, I'm like,

607
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,620
what if I drive, like, you know,
on this side of the freeway

608
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:16,788
-and then a car flips over…
-[Kendall] Oh!

609
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:17,923
-[kim] … and hits me this way?
-[Kendall] Same!

610
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,292
I mean, I'm always afraid
of a car accident.

611
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,359
Like, always.

612
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,462
[Michelle] Do you think you think
about that more often

613
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,729
than the average person?

614
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,231
-Yeah, definitely.
-[Michelle] Yeah.

615
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,365
Any idea why?

616
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,238
I don't know.
I think about it all the time.

617
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,339
[Michelle] Mm-hm.

618
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,974
Like, it drives me crazy.

619
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,577
The interesting thing
about anxiety disorders is

620
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,412
even though they're all
different symptoms--

621
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,413
So you have the panic attacks

622
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,850
and you just sit here and ruminate…
The treatment is very similar.

623
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,418
We could take a drive, we could…

624
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,453
I could show you
what that might look like.

625
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,554
We can, like, key--

626
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,323
[Kendall] I'm not gonna go for that.

627
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,824
We're gonna spin you in the car.

628
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:53,992
Does that work for you?

629
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,694
-Okay. Yeah.
-[Michelle] Yeah, does that work?

630
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,162
-Okay, cool.
-[Kendall] All righty then,

631
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,697
I'm gonna go home. Well, thank you.

632
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,333
-Nice to meet you.
-Awesome. You're welcome. You too.

633
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:05,237
I know this is really difficult
for Kendall,

634
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,205
but I am disappointed

635
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,075
'cause I feel like
it's fixable if she works on it.

636
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,777
Okay.

637
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,147
[Michelle] So what we're trying
to accomplish is…

638
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:19,251
experiencing those thoughts.
So I'm gonna have you tell me

639
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,987
what thoughts are going
through your head as we're driving.

640
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,658
I'm kind of nervous to induce my anxiety,

641
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,427
but if it's, like, an exercise
that she thinks will help,

642
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:30,896
I'm totally willing to try it.

643
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:35,333
I just want to get past my anxiety
and figure out a way just to live life

644
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,701
like I was before.

645
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:41,673
I just heard a story about, like, kids
that threw a rock in a window…

646
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,675
-Mm-hm.
-… and, like, the woman

647
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,677
-that they hit is brain damaged.
-Mm-hm.

648
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,179
And then I'm like,
"Ugh, that could be anyone."

649
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,482
-It, like, breaks my heart.
-Mm-hm.

650
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,884
You know the average person
doesn't think that way, right?

651
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,486
-[Kim] Yeah.
-Yeah, okay. Just checking.

652
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,054
Well, we call these intrusive thoughts.

653
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,790
They're just pop-ins.
They jump in your head

654
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,526
and is related to being responsible

655
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,828
for another human being. And that's scary.

656
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,896
That's overwhelming

657
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,431
-to a lot of moms.
-[Kim] Yeah.

658
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,134
So if you can, since you typically avoid

659
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,603
driving near the center divider,
if we can get over,

660
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,838
my suggestion is
let's get all the way over.

661
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:15,874
[Kim] Okay.

662
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,842
[signal light clicking]

663
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,379
So are you having any thoughts that…

664
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,281
you'll get hit or anything like that?

665
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,716
-A little bit.
-A little bit.

666
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,384
-Yeah.
-[Kim] It's just more like…

667
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,887
I'm extra aware what those cars are doing.

668
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,355
Mm-hm. So…

669
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,590
and do you ever tell yourself,

670
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,225
like, "No, I'll be fine"
or anything like that?

671
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,695
-No, it just… I let it pass.
-Okay, got it. Good.

672
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,164
[Michelle] That's really
what you want to do,

673
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,132
and that's generally
what I teach people to do,

674
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,767
is really just tolerating those thoughts.

675
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:46,104
It's like, try not to be super aware that,

676
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,273
you know, it's that fine line between,

677
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,377
um, being hypervigilant
and, and kind of living your normal life,

678
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,347
making sure I'm aware of what's going on

679
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,816
and then also,

680
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:01,019
like, not changing
my behaviors too much for that.

681
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,723
[Kim] I mean, I've never had anxiety.

682
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,091
I've never had anything

683
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,293
to where I've not really been in control

684
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,863
and so, I think this is just,
like, a slipup

685
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,299
and I have to take back my life.

686
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,669
Yes, all of these bad things could happen.

687
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,338
Um… But again, we don't wanna

688
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,273
necessarily change our lives
because of it.

689
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,875
-Totally.
-[Michelle] So…

690
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,712
[upbeat music]

691
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,821
{\an8}[Khloé] Oh, Scott, Scott, Scott.

692
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,657
That's me. Mm-hm.

693
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,459
First of all, I love your shorts.

694
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:42,994
-[Scott] Thanks.
-[Khloé] And secondly,

695
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,696
what happened to your leg?

696
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,198
-I fell off a scooter.
-What scooter?

697
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,400
[Scott] One of Mason's.

698
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,336
-That's really bad.
-I don't want to talk about it.

699
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,638
-That was ridiculous.
-Anyway…

700
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:57,475
[Khloé] I heard that you are now
flaking hanging out with Kris Jenner.

701
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,810
[breathes deeply]

702
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,311
[Scott] I just think
it's getting a little bit weird

703
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,813
that I'm with her and her friends,

704
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,648
-like, every other day.
-[Khloé] Who cares?

705
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,083
Going to dinner, going to lunches,

706
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,686
pool exercising, pool aerobics,
I mean, what's next?

707
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,020
But aren't you having fun with her?

708
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,623
Totally! But Kourtney kind of gave me
a little [bleep] about it.

709
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,025
-'Cause Kourtney's a hater.
-[Scott] It's not only Kourtney.

710
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,493
-Was it Nancy?
-Nance.

711
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,463
-Nancy.
-Fancy Nancy, AKA Kimmy K,

712
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,764
has been bothering me, too.

713
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,967
Like, "Why are you always with my mom,
and all of her friends, and all the… "

714
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,035
Why do you care?

715
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,204
Maybe I'm liking it too much
and I'm scared.

716
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,607
I think my mom is super cool.
I love her friends,

717
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,143
and I know that all of us,
especially Kourt, would agree,

718
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,213
that my mom and her friends
are definitely a better influence

719
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,182
for Scott than some of his other friends.

720
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,717
It's, like, a great, positive…

721
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,052
thing for him to be around.

722
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,420
I feel like you're more freaked out

723
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,755
'cause you feel like
you're going to cougar town.

724
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,323
-Like, it's fine.
-Right.

725
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,193
I really think you're being crazy,
and I think that you should appreciate

726
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,328
that you're a hit
and that these old broads love you.

727
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,398
And also, like, if we were to compare

728
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,034
to who you were hanging out
with prior to, like…

729
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,370
these broads,
I think you're doing pretty well.

730
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,906
Listen, I… I agree.

731
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,542
I'd rather be hanging out
with your mom and her friends

732
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,377
than people that don't
actually care about me.

733
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,313
-Right.
-They are fun.

734
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,615
I guess you bring up a good point.

735
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,419
You know, I definitely do feel bad
about pushing Kris and her friends away,

736
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,321
'cause I know that they were
only trying to be there for me,

737
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,022
and I feel like she always has been

738
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,358
and I really have a nice time with them.

739
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,960
I shouldn't be scared to admit it.

740
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,962
You got to hang out with the cougars.

741
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,730
[Scott] I like the cougs. Trust me, I do.

742
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,299
-You keep them young.
-Forever young.

743
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,469
-Forever sprung.
-Ew.

744
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,037
[Khloé] Hi, my baby.

745
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,906
-[Scott] Off of me.
-[Khloé] She's a nice girl.

746
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,342
You let other girls lick you, why not her?

747
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,843
Excuse me?

748
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,245
[smooches]

749
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:41,846
[Khloé] My baby.

750
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,482
[upbeat music]

751
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,925
{\an8}[Kris] Look how cute this picture is

752
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,629
{\an8}of your dad and me and Auntie Joyce
and Uncle Larry.

753
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,331
It's almost like
we were all color-coordinated.

754
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,900
[Kim] Saint kind of looks like Robert.

755
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,602
-[Kris] Robert, your brother?
-[Kim] Mm-hm.

756
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,238
It's so wild how fashion…

757
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,607
has so much to do with the memories.

758
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,342
It's like, I remember that outfit.

759
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,779
I had the nerve to wear
a 101 Dalmatians sweater.

760
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,348
Like, out in public
and it wasn't Halloween.

761
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,917
[Kris] Oh, my god, look at your dad.

762
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,285
[Kris laughs]

763
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,786
-[Kim] That mustache.
-[Kris] That's a major 'stache.

764
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,722
Don't you, like, wonder, like,
what would our lives be like,

765
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,125
though, if my dad was here?
Like, don't you think

766
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,761
our lives would've been,
like, so different?

767
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,463
[Kris] I think about it all the time

768
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,667
because I feel like,
in some way, he is still here.

769
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:41,172
Your lives would be fuller, for sure.

770
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,108
[Kris] He would be so proud
of you guys right now.

771
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,643
[Kim] He totally would.

772
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,412
-He would be so…
-He would be like…

773
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:48,580
-… impressed.
-… really excited that, like,

774
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,316
Rob is ventured back over

775
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:54,118
and everyone is, like, all together.

776
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,954
-[Kris] Getting along.
-[Kim] Mm-hm.

777
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,255
[camera shutter clicks]

778
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,459
[Kim] My dad lived his life to the fullest

779
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,662
and I have all these photos now
that I could look back at.

780
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,464
I know he never lived in fear

781
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:11,703
and I don't want to ruin
all of the memories for my kids

782
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,672
because of my own anxiety.

783
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,442
The last thing my dad said to me was,

784
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,879
"I know you'll be okay
and you are strong."

785
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,882
So, I would never want
to not live up to that.

786
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,187
{\an8}[upbeat music]

787
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,230
{\an8}Look how he set up
over here for the painting.

788
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:40,698
[Kris] Hi!

789
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,367
{\an8}-How are you?
-[Brandon] Good, how are you?

790
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,835
{\an8}[Kris] Wine and cheese, ladies?

791
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,204
{\an8}-[Faye] Love that.
-[Kris] This is so cute.

792
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,839
Let's definitely grab some wine.

793
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,907
-[Faye] Definitely.
-Right?

794
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,375
-'Cause that helps, for sure.
-[Kris] Okay.

795
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,676
[Lisa] We're putting our aprons on?

796
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,344
[Brandon] Please, put your aprons on.

797
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,746
-[Scott] Oh, hello.
-Hi.

798
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,114
[all] Hi.

799
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,049
-What's shaking?
-[Lisa] What are you doing here?

800
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,318
-We're painting.
-Coming to painting class.

801
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,621
Are you crazy?
I'm not gonna miss out on this.

802
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,590
[chuckling]
Okay.

803
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,893
I've gone back and forth thinking
about if I'm gonna hang out

804
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,094
with these lovely women or not…

805
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,897
and the truth is,
I don't care what people think.

806
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:16,501
Age really is just a number
and I love all these ladies, so…

807
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,937
I'm not gonna break bonds
with these people

808
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,371
that have only been there for me.

809
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,907
And, you know, these ladies need the Lord.

810
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,275
-Can I have a little bit?
-Do you guys have an extra easel

811
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,977
-by any chance?
-[Scott] Of course they do.

812
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,613
[Brandon] So, here's the base.
Kind of a slight little smiley face.

813
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,248
You see how I kind of angled it?

814
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,083
-[all] Yeah.
-Right. Just do that.

815
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,251
[Scott] Wow.

816
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,954
I like this color. That is a nice palette

817
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,121
-you got there.
-Yeah, are you sure?

818
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,990
-That is nice.
-[Kyle] That's like a teal.

819
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,058
Right. I would almost go

820
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,793
-with a nice turquoise.
-[Lisa] Mm-hm.

821
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:42,994
-[Kris] Okay.
-[Scott] Beautiful.

822
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,829
-Beautiful little line up.
-[Faye] Are you seriously gonna,

823
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,397
like, build a studio in your house?

824
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,066
Is that gonna be the next thing
that you're gonna do?

825
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,368
I'm thinking about…
Well, I'm gonna have Scott do it.

826
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,036
[Lisa] Oh, it's gonna go
in Scott's house, huh?

827
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,404
You're gonna have the artist's studio?

828
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,706
No idea.

829
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,441
Why don't you do sculpting
and do that scene

830
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,842
from <i>Ghost </i>where you, like,

831
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,812
-build that big, phallic symbol?
-[Kris] Oh, we could do sculpting next.

832
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,448
-Right.
-Can somebody make me some green?

833
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,516
-I'll make you some green.
-I need some green!

834
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,852
I need olive green.

835
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,721
[Scott] Oh, you're doing
a very, very nice little job

836
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,522
over there, I'm not gonna lie.

837
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,791
-Ta-da!
-It's beautiful.

838
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,927
-Beautiful, guys!
-Yay!

839
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,830
-[Lisa] Yours is really good.
-[Kyle] Oh, that's pretty.

840
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:22,200
[Kris] Thanks for coming, Scott.
I love having you in the class.

841
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,434
-Oh, yeah.
-[Kris] That made it fun.

842
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,736
Just one of the girls, you know?

843
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,804
Yeah, well, you look good in a dress.

844
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,106
Thanks.

845
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,273
[Scott] I also wanted to say,

846
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,776
I'm sorry I didn't meet you guys
the other day for lunch.

847
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,445
I feel bad that I flaked on you.
Now I'm thinking, I'm like,

848
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,881
it's better this than something else.

849
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:38,649
So, that's why I came today,

850
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,318
I was like, I miss hanging out
with everybody.

851
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:44,522
You live a very tiny life on earth
and enjoy yourself

852
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,424
-and do what makes you happy.
-Totally true.

853
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,192
[Kris] And how much fun did we have?

854
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,094
[Scott] Listen, we have
a nice little time for ourselves.

855
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,529
-A nice little time.
-I love you.

856
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:52,597
I love you.

857
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,199
[upbeat music]

858
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:08,079
{\an8}I hate this ottoman with a passion.

859
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,716
-Like…
-[Kim] It's pretty gross.

860
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,785
[Kourtney] I honestly cannot stand it.

861
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,720
[Kourtney] Hi!

862
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,689
Hello.
[humming]

863
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,525
[laughter]

864
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,028
[phone ringing]

865
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,397
[Kim] Hey, Michelle.

866
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,698
{\an8}[Michelle] <i>Hey, how are you?</i>

867
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,368
{\an8}-I'm good, how are you?
-[Michelle] <i>I'm good.</i>

868
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,804
I've had no anxiety on the road.

869
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,338
-[Michelle] <i>That's awesome.</i>
-You know what's funny?

870
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,574
Now that I think about it,
I really haven't had anxiety

871
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,942
since I saw you.

872
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,977
-Like no bull [bleep].
-[Michelle] <i>That's amazing.</i>

873
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,213
-<i>I cured you.</i>
-Yeah, I think you did.

874
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,650
[Michelle] <i>There is no cure for anxiety.</i>

875
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,386
<i>And the thing is sometimes
when people talk about this stuff</i>

876
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,589
<i>and kind of get educated
about where the thoughts are coming from</i>

877
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,392
<i>there's a calming quality in that.</i>

878
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,827
[Kim] Yeah, totally.

879
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,929
I have, like, a little bit more
of, like, a handle.

880
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,598
Like, I just, it's not
freaking me out as much.

881
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,000
[Michelle] <i>That's good.
And, uh, how's Kendall doing?</i>

882
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,103
[Kim] She's the same.

883
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,706
And she's supposed to fly out
for work in a couple of days.

884
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,075
Like, that's
when she gets her anxiety, so…

885
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,444
[Michelle] <i>Right. Right,
right, right. on the plane.</i>

886
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,681
[Michelle] <i>You can also just do simple,
like, breathing exercises.</i>

887
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,616
<i>So, you know,
do meditation or mindfulness.</i>

888
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,718
Yeah, maybe.

889
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:25,123
[Kim] I got such a good control
over my anxiety,

890
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,859
I want that for Kendall
and I want her to really work on it

891
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,495
'cause Kendall's been staying in LA

892
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:34,932
and living in this anxiety fear
about traveling,

893
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,835
and that's not really realistic
for her career.

894
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,304
I don't think
this has to get the best of her.

895
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,642
[upbeat music]

896
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,183
{\an8}[Kendall] I hate bodysuits
more than anything.

897
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,652
-[Kim] Hmm?
-I said I hate bodysuits

898
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,188
more than anything. I'm too long for them.

899
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,290
Wait, do you like what I did
to my phone, seriously?

900
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,658
-[Kendall] Yeah. Yeah.
-Isn't it cute?

901
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,260
'Cause I wanted, like, a KIMOJI case

902
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,129
but, like, a LuMee case so I put stickers.

903
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,701
So what's so crazy is that
I literally haven't had anxiety.

904
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,436
-That's crazy.
-[Kim] Haven't even thought about it.

905
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,039
-[Kendall] Mm-hm.
-But I also think that…

906
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,575
everybody handles things
in different ways.

907
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,745
So I think maybe it's really good
if we just like, try meditating.

908
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,547
You know, I'll kind of,
like, let you do your thing

909
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,815
since I've tried meditating,
it's not my thing.

910
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,451
I think actually talking to the girl
was more my thing.

911
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,854
[Kim] As a way to try to help Kendall,

912
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,557
I set up a meditation for her and I

913
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,725
just to have this, like, little session.

914
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,761
[Kim] Some people live by it.

915
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,131
And because, you know,
there is no cure for anxiety.

916
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,700
You have to get control of your feelings.

917
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,236
Unless you want to change your job
and do something totally different,

918
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,506
which you don't. So I feel like
you just have to, like…

919
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,776
get ahold of it, you know what I mean?

920
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,511
-Yeah.
-[Kim] I'll bring you out there.

921
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,546
You know, you can just see if you like it.

922
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,048
[Kendall] Okay.

923
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,983
I'm into it.

924
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,151
[Kim] So let's go.

925
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,253
[Kendall] I do feel like Kim is right,

926
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,921
'cause I do love my career.

927
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,357
And I love being able to travel
the world, and I feel blessed.

928
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,959
This is the lifestyle I want to live,

929
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:09,927
so meditation's something
that I'm willing to try

930
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,029
just to kind of cope with it.

931
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,798
How serene is this?

932
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,235
Oh, wow, are you trying to hold my hand?

933
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,336
[chuckles]

934
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,737
-Yeah.
-[Heather] Hello.

935
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,872
-[Kim] How are you?
-Hi, good, I'm Heather.

936
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,375
-Hi, I'm Kim.
-[Heather] Kim, nice to meet you.

937
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,776
-Hi. I'm Kendall. Let us…
-[woman] Nice to meet you.

938
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,012
-[Heather] … have a seat.
-[Kim] Ooh, what's this?

939
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,914
{\an8}So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna start

940
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,683
{\an8}with just learning to watch
the mind a little bit.

941
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,485
[Heather] Now getting into a posture.

942
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,120
Whatever's comfortable for you.

943
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:40,858
So the thinking mind
tells us what to do all day.

944
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,128
So for this moment in time,
what we're doing is

945
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,197
we're dropping into our wisdom mind.

946
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,932
Dropping that question,

947
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,135
"What do you need?" Asking the heart.

948
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,605
Developing another voice
rather than that inner thinker,

949
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,575
we can have
that compassionate voice saying,

950
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,211
"I'm here to give you comfort."

951
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,047
"I'm here to listen to you."

952
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,117
"I'm here, you're safe."

953
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:11,188
We can create that inner soother
to help care for our heart,

954
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,556
our body and our mind.

955
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,894
We just slowly
begin to strengthen this muscle,

956
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,330
allowing ourselves to give ourselves care.

957
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,067
And when we're ready,
gently opening the eyes.

958
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,175
Well, you had a lot of stillness.

959
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,576
-Really?
-[Heather] Yes, that was great.

960
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,879
-Is that a good thing?
-Yes, that's a really good thing.

961
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:37,548
-There was a lot of stillness.
-I feel like I zoned out.

962
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,884
-That's a good thing, right?
-[Kendall] Yeah.

963
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,419
-No, I loved it.
-Good.

964
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,787
-Okay.
-Thank you.

965
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,989
[Kendall] It's pretty amazing because…

966
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,724
this is definitely making me, like,

967
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,060
relax a little bit and find some peace.

968
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,662
And knowing that…

969
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,832
having anxiety isn't something
that you can just fix

970
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,033
and it'll go away,

971
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,502
meditation's definitely
something that could help me.

972
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,204
It's something that I can obviously take

973
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,707
everywhere with me.
Whenever I feel like I need it.

974
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,176
[Heather] So we can do those practices
when we're not anxious

975
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:09,213
and still bring in that compassioned voice
even when things are really stressful.

976
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,782
-Well, thank you.
-[Heather] You're welcome.

977
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,883
Thank you.

978
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,223
[upbeat music]

979
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,933
{\an8}[Kendall] What are these juices?

980
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,534
{\an8}[Kim] Take whatever.

981
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,702
[chuckles]

982
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,742
[groans, gags]

983
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,844
You know what's weird is
I usually don't like meditating,

984
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,278
-but I kind of liked it.
-Yeah.

985
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,080
I feel like I should tell Mom.

986
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,715
Oh, my god, call Mom and be like,

987
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,818
"We have to cancel. I can't do it."

988
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,687
I already said that to her.
It's gonna be like,

989
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,155
-"Did you cancel it?"
-[line ringing]

990
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,290
[Kris on phone] <i>Hey, Kendall.</i>

991
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,859
Hi, did you cancel everything?

992
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,495
[Kris] <i>Cancel everything?</i>

993
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,230
-Yeah, like…
-[Kris] <i>Are you kidding me?</i>

994
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,700
<i>No, I didn't cancel anything, Kendall.</i>

995
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,769
<i>I mean, these people
are gonna lose their minds.</i>

996
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,670
<i>Everybody's booked
and they're counting on you.</i>

997
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,872
Mom, chill, chill.

998
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,174
[Kris] <i>Why would I chill?</i>

999
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,176
-<i>It's not funny.</i>
-Because I think I'll be okay.

1000
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,946
I just did a meditation class

1001
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,149
and I feel like it might actually help.

1002
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,152
-I really liked it.
-[Kris] <i>That's really cool.</i>

1003
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,053
<i>Do you think that you know how to do that</i>

1004
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,089
<i>if you tried it again
on your own, Kendall?</i>

1005
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,190
Yeah.

1006
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,892
[Kris] <i>Well, I'm proud of you
for doing that.</i>

1007
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,593
-<i>That's awesome.</i>
-[Kendall] Thanks.

1008
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,897
{\an8}-Love you.
-[Kris] <i>All right. I love you, too.</i>

1009
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,064
I really don't think I would've done it

1010
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,534
if you hadn't have made me
do it, so thank you.

1011
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,403
Sometimes it's good to be forced
to do things.

1012
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,506
[Kim] <i>On the next episode… </i>

1013
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,475
I think it's crazy
what's going on in the world

1014
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,710
and I'm passionate
about stricter gun laws.

1015
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,446
If you get involved
with that type of stuff,

1016
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,147
you're gonna get a lot of hate.

1017
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,882
[Kris] Where's the interview person?

1018
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,820
[Kris] We are doing a legacy video
with my mom, Mary Jo,

1019
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,254
and I'm nervous.

1020
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,889
What's your biggest fear?

1021
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,258
I try not to fear.

1022
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,160
What's your biggest fear?

1023
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,229
[Kris chokes up]
I don't wanna say it.

1024
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,199
Why did you ask me that?
I can't believe I'm crying.
