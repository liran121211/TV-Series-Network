{\an8}I've tried every single thing.

00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,674
{\an8}I thought he was really gonna change,

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,542
{\an8}but, like, this is Lamar.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,711
{\an8}[Khloé] Why do I treat him
better than I treat myself?

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:15,048
{\an8}I feel like you shouldn't put
so much energy into it.

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,685
{\an8}There's one more thing I have
to talk to you guys about,

7
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,120
{\an8}but I don't want you guys to get mad.

{\an8}-[Kim] You're having a baby.
-[Rob] Yeah.

9
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:23,790
{\an8}I know Khloé's probably feeling--

10
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,158
{\an8}[Khloé] Congratulations.

11
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,595
{\an8}So, have you told anybody
about Rob and Chyna?

12
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,563
{\an8}-No.
-How do you feel?

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,298
{\an8}I mean, it's Rob's life.

14
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,500
{\an8}[Khloé] How do you feel?

15
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,301
{\an8}[Kourtney] I just want him to be happy.

16
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,404
{\an8}[Khloé] My brother and I have always had

17
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,772
{\an8}such a strong connection.

18
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,141
{\an8}What bothers me is that Rob has

19
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,942
{\an8}completely just disconnected from me.

[Khloé] You know what I hate?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,036
So, yesterday on the red carpet,
what's up with my inner thighs?

28
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,507
Nothing. I didn't see anything.

29
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,843
Yeah, they're [bleep] nasty,

"What kind of ho works out every day

31
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,647
and doesn't have good thighs?"

32
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,949

What's wrong with your inner thighs?

I will show you my picture.

We had Popeyes once on the airplane.

-[Don] Let me just take a look.
-[Khloé] You ass [bleep].

-They're right though.
-Have you seen this?

I don't know what she's talking about.

44
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,338
I mean, maybe I'm looking
at something wrong.

45
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,207
-[Khloé] That inner thing.
-Yeah, what are you…

00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,510
Yes, I want it to be hard.

I had more muscle definition.

Thanks.

70
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:54,574
I had the craziest appointment
at my doctor's today.

71
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,910
'Cause I've been struggling with just,

72
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,411
you know, getting older.

73
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,679
And it was so interesting

74
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,615
because your body can really break down

75
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,150
if you're not careful,

76
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,818
and we really need
to take care of ourselves.

77
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,221
So, what? Do you feel tired?
Is that why you went?

78
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,690
Yeah, just kind of, like,
not great, tired.

79
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,759
Like, welcome to 60, thank you.

80
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,128
Yeah, but, I mean, you look good
and you're running around.

81
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,397
I mean, you do more than
most people do in their 30s.

82
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,899
The problem is there's no reason to be,

83
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,434
like, 20 pounds overweight.

84
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,138
You're not 20 pounds overweight.

85
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,440
Aw, thank you.

86
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,211
My life is always crazy,
and I'm constantly

87
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,379
under a lot of pressure
and have a lot going on,

88
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,516
so I need to figure out a way
to increase my energy,

89
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,718
and just be able to have

90
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,820
a little more stamina during the day

91
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,456
because I'm exhausted
and I need to step it up.

92
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,925
At the end of the thing, the doctor goes,

93
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,495
"Well, I'm going to give you this kit.

94
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,197
And I need you to go home

95
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,335
and basically collect a stool sample."

play with your poop like that.

Yeah, so you can feel your best.

My mom hasn't been really
into working out lately.

158
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,754
[Kourtney] And she has been complaining
about not feeling well

159
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,622
and just feeling low energy.

160
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,924
[Don] So we'll do a warm up first,
get some blood flowing,

161
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,226
and then we'll stretch everything out.

00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,747
Kourtney, I used to do track
in high school.

173
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,682
-You did?
-Yup.

174
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,251
You know what? I still got it.

175
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,419
[Don whoops]

176
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,121
Let's go. One up,
then drop all the way down.

177
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,791
Don't stop, Mom. Come on, you can do this.

178
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,592
[Kris] Whoo! Baby.

179
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,762
I set the pace.
You have to keep up with me.

180
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:10,897
Easy.

181
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,231
[Don] Okay, I see you showing off now.

182
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,466
[Kris laughs]

183
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,601
-[Don] Last one for the abs.
-Last one?

184
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,371
Three, two, one.

185
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,739
Let's do three sets. Flip back over.

186
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,174
What?

187
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,341
That was one set.

188
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,910
We're not done?

189
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,746
-Each quarter has three sets.
-Oh, [bleep].

190
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,215
[laughter]

191
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,349
[Kris laughs]

192
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,617
-Come on.
-[Don] Let's go.

193
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,752
[Kris] I got this.

194
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,654
-Let's go.
-[Kourtney] Do it, Mom.

195
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,721
[pants]

196
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,623
Three up, then right back down.

197
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,325
Four up, there you go.

198
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,460
Five up.

199
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,728
One, up, drop, good.

200
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,697
Four. Do it.

201
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,998
Five. Knees up.

202
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,935
I have not really been exercising

203
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,471
to the extent that I used to.

204
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,539
I guess I shouldn't have been so surprised

205
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,141
that this is such a challenge.

206
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,576
Two sets down, one to go.

207
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,045
[Kris groans loudly]

208
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,013
Second quarter, second quarter.

209
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,548
[Kris grunts]
Here we go.

210
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,583
[Kris] But you know what?

211
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,651
I'm not gonna let anything stop me

212
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,987
from giving this everything I have,

213
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,323
and I'm gonna push through this workout.

214
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,024
-[Don] How you doing?
-[Kris] Really great.

215
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,593
[Don] Good. That's a wrap.

216
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,760
[Don whoops]

217
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,497
[Kris] Oh, my god.
My legs, they have a mind of their own.

218
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,232
-[Don laughs]
-They're running away!

219
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,833
[Kris] I can't control them.

220
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,702
Help, get me back.

221
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,871
I can't help myself!

222
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,440
[upbeat music]

223
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,347
{\an8}-[Elizabeth over phone] <i>Hi.</i>
-[Khloé] <i>Hey.</i>

224
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,483
{\an8}[Elizabeth] <i>So, you decided</i>
<i>that you're ready to do this.</i>

225
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,252
{\an8}I just wanna make sure
that it's bulletproof,

226
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,720
{\an8}that no matter our marital status,

227
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,021
{\an8}I still could help Lamar

228
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,723
if, God forbid, this were to happen again.

229
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,691
[Elizabeth on phone]
<i>If this happens again,</i>

230
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,860
<i>and Lamar is not in sound mind</i>

231
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,730
<i>and Lamar is on life support,</i>

232
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,600
<i>you get to make the decision regardless…</i>

233
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,570
-Of marital status. Yeah.
-[Elizabeth] <i>Yes.</i>

234
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,171
[Khloé] Perfect. Thank you.

235
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,740
[Elizabeth] <i>You're welcome.
I'll talk to you later.</i>

236
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,475
-[Khloé] Okay. Bye.
-[Elizabeth] <i>Okay. Bye.</i>

237
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,876
[Kourtney] What's happening?

238
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,578
You're getting a divorce again?

239
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,580
What I was just talking to Elizabeth about

240
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,115
was Lamar asked

241
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,884
that, if anything were to happen
to him again, that I always be,

242
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,587
like, his medical advisor
and, like, make all those decisions

243
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,988
'cause he has no one else to trust.

244
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,024
And I said, "But when we get a divorce,

245
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,525
I legally don't have those rights."

246
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,960
So, we met with lawyers.

247
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,628
That, if anything were to happen,

248
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,232
regardless of our marital status,
I will still help him.

249
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,833
And so I heard they were done,

250
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,503
so I just called Elizabeth
to confirm they were done,

251
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,971
and then we'll re-file.

252
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,072
-Yeah.
-Like, this…

253
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,340
how long am I gonna sit in this for?

254
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,308
[Kourtney] Yeah, no.

255
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,909
This is ridiculous.

256
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,313
I'm finalizing my divorce papers
today with my lawyer…

257
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,048
again, for the second time.

258
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,250
[Khloé] Lamar and I have spoken about it,
we're both on board.

259
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,353
{\an8}So, we are going to file tomorrow,

260
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,955
and so it might be public,

261
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,324
but we don't really anticipate much.

262
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,992
-[Lamar] <i>All right.</i>
-Okay?

263
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:53,893
[Lamar] <i>Yeah.</i>

264
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,027
Okay.

265
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,697
Regardless if Lamar and I
have spoken about it

266
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,933
and that we're on the same page,
it's still bittersweet.

267
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,235
[Khloé] I was holding out, you know,
to help Lamar,

268
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,537
but Lamar's not helping himself,

269
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,739
so I have to do what's best for me.

270
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,174
And I have to move on and just be done,

271
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,076
like there's no reason to hold on to this.

272
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,578
[Khloé] It will always be love
and I will always,

273
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,847
like, love Lamar
and, like, be his friend, but…

274
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,416
it's time for me to start
the next chapter of my life.

275
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,721
{\an8}[upbeat music]

276
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,865
{\an8}[Kris moaning]

277
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,872
-Okay. How are your headaches?
-[Khloé] Fine.

278
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,341
But I mainly give them to myself, I think.

279
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,243
I just stress myself out.

280
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,878
[Kris] That's not good.

281
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,047
I've been doing that my whole life.

282
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,448
-Now, that's not good.
-Take a page out of my book

283
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,617
-and don't do it.
-[Khloé] That's not good.

284
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,620
[Kourtney] Khlo. Come to the kitchen.

285
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,355
-The boss is calling.
-Oh.

286
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,657
I'm the boss.

287
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:58,858
[Khloé] Not of me.

288
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,694
[Kris] You gonna go to Scott's birthday?

289
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,829
-[Khloé] Yup. Hey, boss.
-[Kourtney] Hey.

290
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,564
-Are you gonna go?
-I don't know.

291
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,167
I said I'll have to decide last minute.

292
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,335
-See what's going on…
-[Kris] You should go.

293
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,770
…with the kids.

294
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,675
[Kourtney] Scott invited me
to his birthday party in Las Vegas.

295
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,277
And I'm just not sure if I wanna go.

296
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,815
I mean, I'm so happy that Scott and I
are getting along so well

297
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,117
and that we're co-parenting,

298
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,454
but I think hanging out
with Scott without the kids,

299
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,291
Scott can just take any little thing
and run with it,

300
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,559
and think that, like,

301
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,227
we're getting back together tomorrow.

302
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:40,199
[Kourtney] Right now, I can't even wrap
my head around that idea.

303
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,402
There's so much work
that would be involved,

304
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,838
and I'm so not even there yet.

305
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,007
[Kris] Wait, so when are you going?

306
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,575
[Khloé] I have a shoot on Friday,

307
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,277
so I would have to leave after my shoot.

308
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,045
But that's when he told me
he was leaving anyway.

309
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,915
And he said the plane
was gonna come back right after.

310
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,684
Yeah, 'cause he said
he has something the next day.

311
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,952
What does he have the next day?

312
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,021
[Kourtney] Atlantic City pool party.

313
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,790
-What?
-[Kris] That's wild.

314
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,525
You are cute.

315
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,494
You're cute.

316
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,064
[upbeat music]

317
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,745
Hey!

318
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,046
What is this, off-season?

319
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,147
[chuckles]
Yeah.

320
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,382
-What are you icing your leg for?
-[laughs]

321
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,587
I was working out
with Kourtney and Khloé with that Don guy.

322
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:38,891
I ran 20… 35 laps.

323
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,060
[Scott] That's ridiculous. Like, for what?

324
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,763
Well, just I'm going through
this sluggish stage,

325
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,331
and I used to be in such great shape

326
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,299
and now I cannot get it together.

327
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,869
I've been really good

328
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,304
about showing up for my workouts with Don.

329
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,540
[Kris] And he's really tough.

330
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,610
I don't think I've ever been so tired

331
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,145
and exhausted in my life.

332
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,114
But it's really gonna pay off.
I just know it is.

333
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,549
[Kris] No pain, no gain.

334
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,519
I mean, I just wanna feel good
and be healthy.

335
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,454
[Scott] Water aerobics.

336
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,389
You could do the big move
from <i>Dirty Dancing,</i>

337
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,658
Corey could hold you up, spin you around.

338
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,493
-[Kris chuckles]
-That's normal.

339
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,928
[laughs]
Oh, my god.

340
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,031
I understand Kris wants to keep her youth

341
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,699
and keep her body looking good,

342
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,468
but now she's starting to work out

343
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,236
with Kourtney and Khloé?

344
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,705
They're little animals
and they work out every single day.

345
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,675
[Scott] Of course, you're gonna go
break a knee or something.

346
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,577
She's not 20 years old anymore.

347
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:36,081
Why are you trying to be
something you're not?

348
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,449
Everyone loves you as you are.

349
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,552
Don't think you need to try
to keep up with them.

350
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,420
They're psychotic. You look beautiful.

351
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,556
You're, like, the hottest
60-year-old on the planet.

352
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,057
That's a known fact.

353
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,794
You look about 40, but you are 60.

354
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,529
You can't be running 5,000 laps

355
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,331
in a tennis court with a bunch of kids.

356
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,732
You'll kill yourself.

357
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,203
-[Kris] Yeah.
-I mean, at least your outfit looks nice

358
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,337
and everything matches.

359
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,505
Thank you.

360
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,173
Other than different sweats to the shoes,

361
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,408
-but okay.
-I know.

362
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,609

{\an8}[Scott] <i>P was telling me last night</i>

365
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,821
how many different names she had.

366
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,424
She goes, "Sometimes I go by P,

367
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,060
sometimes KiKi calls me Peepaleep."

368
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,962
-[Kim chuckles]
-"Sometimes I go by Poosh,

369
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,730
sometimes I go by Poosh-kaloosh."

370
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,832
[Kim] Yeah, North goes…
She calls her Peepaleep now.

371
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,100
-That's cute.
-'Cause she heard me say it.

372
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,668
-Hi.
-[Kourtney] Hey.

373
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,070
By the way, are you guys aware

374
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,272
that your mom thinks she's, like, 30?

375
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,875
-[Kourtney chuckles]
-She's not though.

376
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,277
She's 60. She's got a lot of pressure.

377
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,112
She just wants to look good, and she does.

378
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,314
She looks better than any
other 60-year-old alive.

379
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,949
But she… Honestly, what is she thinking

380
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,051
to come over here
and jump into you and Khloé's workout?

381
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,519
[Kourtney] She wanted to do that.

382
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,788
[Scott] Yeah, but I feel like
you should've said,

383
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,891
"Hey, we've been doing
this workout a long time.

384
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,359
Pace yourself."

385
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,060
Yeah.

386
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,631
[Kourtney] I mean, Scott is right,

387
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,833
and I think sometimes we just forget

388
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,302
that my mom maybe can't keep up with us.

389
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,305
But I've seen her
do these kind of workouts,

390
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,706
like, our whole lives,

391
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,675
so it's just easy to forget.

392
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,711
[Kourtney]
But I do love working out with my mom,

393
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,446
so I really do wanna find something

394
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,781
that we can do together.

395
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,650
[Scott] All I'm saying is
maybe you could do

396
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,051
something that's more up her alley.

397
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,353
I don't think she needs to, like,

398
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,888
break down on the side of the road

399
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,390
like an old car at this point.

400
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,493

{\an8}[Kris] <i>Hey, Khloé.</i>

403
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,412
This is the most beautiful room.

-[Khloé] In Saint Barts.
-[Kris] Right, I remember that.

00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,387
Look at your body.
I gave birth to that thing.

-You did.

-Not that size, but yeah.
-[Kris] Oh, my god.

00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,361
[Khloé] Um… Have you talked to Rob lately?

411
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,263
[Kris] Aw…

412
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,032
You guys haven't seen each other
in such a long time.

413
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,234
-[Khloé] I know.
-That makes me really sad.

414
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,302
It makes me really sad.

415
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,438
I text Rob just the other day

416
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,540
for the first time in, like, weeks.
And I was like,

417
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,242
"Hey, um, you know I love you
and I miss you,

418
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,311
and I really hope Chyna's pregnancy
is going well."

419
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,846
And he just, "I love you, too."

420
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,848
But, like, there's no, like,
effort on his part.

421
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,217
Like, he has never reached out to me once.

422
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,387
It's just weird
'cause Kourtney, Kim, Kendall, Kylie,

423
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,122
like, no matter what we're doing,

424
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,057
we always text or FaceTime where…

425
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,159
[Kris] Yeah, make sure
you guys stay connected.

426
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,162
But no matter how busy we are,
or how in love we are,

427
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,965
or how sad we are,
like, we turn to each other.

428
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,935
So, it's so weird that we don't talk,
and that's bizarre.

429

[somber music]

430
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,507
[Khloé] Rob and I grew up inseparable.

431
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,976
And I feel like no matter
where I've been in my life,

432
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,746
Rob's always been someone
that I lean onto.

433
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,548
And especially now I'm going through
so much this week,

434
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,917
I'm really missing his support
and just him being there,

435
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,520
and just even for me to go to his room
and hang out with him.

436
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,422
You would think, like,
with him starting a family,

437
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,590
he would wanna talk about stuff.

438
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,926

to, like, help you, you know.

460
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,019
I think as far as your decision
to wanna get a divorce again,

461
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,154
I think it's, like, inevitable
and I think that you should.

462
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,956
I think that you shouldn't, like,

463
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,758
live your life, you know,

464
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,259
-just like waiting to see…
-I don't need anybody… I don't…

465
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,694
I don't need anybody to care.

466
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,362
-I really…
-No, but it's not…

467
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,864
But it's not that we don't care.

468
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,732
I just think it's, like,
the best decision.

469
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,869
So I'm like, don't wanna rock the boat

470
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,471
and talk too deep about it

471
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,272
in case you change your mind.

472
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,008
[Kim] I think Khloé acts
like she doesn't need the help

473
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,010
and she's so strong
and she doesn't want the help,

474
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,579
but then, she really does need it.

475
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,949
[Kim] So it's just hard to know how to be.

476
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,351
But I don't want Khloé to ever think
that we don't care.

477
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,056
It is for my best interest but is it hard?

and just, like,
having a whole other, like--

683
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,696
Are you really
in my conversation right now?

684
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,565
'Cause I have not bothered
one person here.

685
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,433
Obviously, that's the problem,
I want you to

686
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,035
'cause you're, like,
the life of the party.

687
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,370
I am the life of the party,

688
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,438
but right now, I'm doing something else.

689
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,539
And then when I get off,

690
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,641
then I'll be the life of the party again.

691
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:23,742
All right, let me know when you're ready.

692
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,110
Right, so I'll let you know.

693
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,113
Come on, dear… Come here.

694
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,614
-No, no, no.
-This is my birthday.

695
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,915
No, no, no, no, no, no.

696
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,252
-[laughter]
-Do I have to move down

697
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,987
to the end of the table?

698
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,090
I know Kourt is really concerned

699
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,992
about sending the wrong message to Scott,

700
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,095
but I think all of us,
and Kourtney herself,

701
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,463
would feel really weird

702
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,499
if Scott actually stopped
flirting with her.

703
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,700
[Khloé] I mean, look at them.

704
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,802
They're so comfortable around each other.

705
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,037
And I don't care
if they're together or not,

706
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,805
this is just gonna be their dynamic.

707
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,074
[Scott] Man, this is one
miserable [bleep] table.

708
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,743
We're chilling. What do you want us to do,
dance on the table?

709
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,378
I mean, if I had it my way, yeah.

710
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,713
[Scott] Should we go to the club?

711
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,983
Whoo! Vegas!

712
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:07,986
[camera shutters clicking]

713
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,321

[upbeat music]

716
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,036
Everybody say, "Happy birthday, Scott."

717
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,672
[all] Happy birthday!

718
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,209

[indistinct chattering]

721
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,824
[Kourtney] Ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah!

722
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,726
I'll get her. I'll break her down.

723
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,097
-You all right, Mom?
-Yeah.

724
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,431
Do you wanna make out?

725
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:05,276
I'm so happy that Scott and I
are getting along so well

726
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:08,713
and that we're having
so much fun just being silly.

727
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,417
And I think I was maybe
overanalyzing the situation

728
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,718
because there's no reason

729
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,054
we just can't all have fun together.

730

-[Kris chuckles]

734
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:32,904
Do you want something to eat, Rob?

735
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,005
[Rob] Uh, I'm all right.

736
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,441
[Kris] There's a chicken
and broccoli plate here for you.

737
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,410
{\an8}-Doesn't that look yummy?
-[Penelope] Mm-hm.

738
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,812
So healthy.

739
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,514
Thanks.

740
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,649
[Kris] You want another napkin, Boo?

741
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,985
Let's put it like this.

742
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,687
This is what I used to do to Rob
when he was little.

743
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:50,622
Yeah.

744
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:51,890
[Kris chuckles]

745
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,458
[Kris] Um…

746
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,426
So have you talked to Khloé lately?

747
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,895
-No.
-[Kris] Hm.

748
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,296
You're her best friend.

749
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,265
And she hasn't talked to you
in a really long time.

750
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:01,866
Doubt I'm her best friend.

751
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,635
You're her best friend.

752
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,037
-You really are.
-[chuckles]

753
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,274
She loves you so much
and she misses her brother.

754
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,743
Well, she should be careful
what she says and…

755
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,745
'cause she does this all to herself.

756
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,214
I get that you're in
this new relationship,

757
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,448
that's amazing for you.

758
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,150
-Mm-hm.
-But it doesn't mean

759
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:22,053
that you can't still be close
to all of us.

760
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,288
That's how life works.

761
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,290
No, I know, but y'all aren't, like,

762
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,759
that welcoming of this relationship,

763
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,494
so you can't expect me to just be like,

764
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:32,163
"Oh, let's all hang out
and everything's cool and fine."

765
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,264
It's not that easy.

766
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,434
[Kris] Khloé has always
been there for Rob,

767
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,237
and she needs him now more than ever.

768
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,940
[Kris] So, this is his turn
to be there for her.

769
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,610
My hope is just that Rob
realizes how important this is

770
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,245
and that he makes it right.

771
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,917
{\an8}[upbeat music]

00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,590
I get that you're in

that's amazing for you.

-Mm-hm.

It's not that easy.

782
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,842
Don't you think that having a baby

783
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,444
is one of the most amazing things

784
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,546
that can happen to you in your life?

785
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,481
And that's what you wanna
share with everybody,

786
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,416
and, like, the family

787
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,886
and let us share the journey with you.

788
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,489
It's nice
if you still have a bond with your family

789
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,524
because we all love you so much.

790
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,227
And I want you and Khloé to be okay

791
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,996
and happy and connected.

792
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,130
It's your sister.

[smacks lips]
Mom…

794
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,001
You know, she's had a hard year

795
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,269
and going through…

796
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,573
a bad time with all the Lamar stuff still.

797
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,677
And she couldn't need her family
more than she does now.

798
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,279
And that includes you.

799
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,214
So, if you made an effort

800
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,816
just to kind of mend the feelings
that are hurt

801
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:02,287
and just try
to get back on track with everyone,

802
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,823
it would be so easy
if you would just make the first move.

803
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,393
No, I know.

804
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,594
I get it.

805
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,563

So, I had Khloé's pajamas
dropped off at her house.

838
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,127
So she could just wear them here.

wanna do something for Khloé.

00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,694
The "heir of all you possess"?

854
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,696
[Kourtney] It's just from a book
that I read to the kids.

855
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:26,931
-Oh, I thought you meant…
-No one takes it

856
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:27,999
-too literally…
-…you are leaving me

857
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,367
-everything in your will.
-…literally or seriously, okay?

858
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,369
I doubt you're the type of person
who has a will.

859
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,770
-[Kim] What?
-Kourtney seems like,

860
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:33,838
"When you die, you just die.

861
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,273
No one should care about,

862
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,908
like, material possessions."

863
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,377
[Khloé] No, really, what's happening?

864
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,113
[Kourtney] I just wanted you
to feel adored…

865
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,882
-Mm-hm.
-…admired, loved, and cared about.

866
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,584
[Khloé] I do feel… but why?

867
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,952
What happened?

868
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,821
Well, what hasn't happened?

869
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,123
-Yeah.
-True story.

870
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,458
That is the question.

871
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,959
True story.

872
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,528
[Kim] You've been through a lot lately.

873
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,064
You just re-filed for divorce.

874
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,867
[Kim] And even though you act strong
and, like, together,

875
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,570
it's just, like, sometimes you need TLC.

876
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,806
This is a pampering session
to just keep you going.

877
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,675
Thank you, guys.

878
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,244
This just shows that, you know,
my sisters do love me

879
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,279
and they are aware
of everything I'm going through.

880
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,983
I do not have a clue
what I would do without them.

881
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,686
[Khloé] When you have people
that you know you can depend on,

882
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:22,954
even though you're going through [bleep],

883
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,123
you just know everything's
gonna be okay eventually.

884
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,624
Do you guys wanna know who the hottest guy

885
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:27,558
-in the world is?
-Who?

886
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,093
[Khloé] There's this guy

887
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,829
that became famous
because of his mug shot.

888
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,532
What if we find him
and try to set him up with Khloé?

889
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,335
[Khloé] Like, he's just, like,
such a hot man.

890
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,470
Kourtney, how hot is this guy?

891
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,305
Ooh, he is hot.

892
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,708
What did he go to jail for,
is the question?

893
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,842
"Single charge.

894
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,011
Felon in possession of a firearm.

895
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,114
He had to go
to a transitional housing facility."

896
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,582
-Honestly…
-[Kourtney] Damn!

897
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,785
…having a man on house arrest
is the best man to have.

898
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:55,753
They can't go anywhere.

899
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,289
I'll be Bonnie. He can be Clyde.

900
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,457
Ooh!

901
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,528
[upbeat music]

902
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,968
{\an8}[Scott] <i>This doesn't seem that safe.</i>

903
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,004
{\an8}[Kourtney] <i>You could probably do
a good butt thing.</i>

904
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,373
-[Velcro ripping]
-[Scott] <i>Oh… Oh, yeah.</i>

905
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,708
[Kourtney] <i>I'm sweating like a beast.</i>

906
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,211
Okay, and one. Two.

907
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,445
Pull it out now, three.

908
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,714
I think Don told me he does Pilates.

909
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,917
-[clanking]
-Whoa!

910
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,251
What in the [bleep]?

911
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,953
Could've taken my head off.

912
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,389
Who knew Pilates was so dangerous?

913
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:32,657
What are you doing now?

914
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,458
Do you even think
you're doing anything right?

915
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,394
Oh, [bleep].

916
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,596
Looks like you're about to give birth.

917
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,565
Well, that's what I thought
these were for.

918
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,066
Here we go, coming round.

919
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:45,203
Mason number three or four,
where are you? Hello?

920
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,005
I took Scott's advice to heart

921
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,675
and got my mom a Pilates machine.

922
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,410
It'll be great for my mom.

923
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:56,047
And it's actually something
that I've really been wanting to do.

924
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,649
So it's good for both of us.

925
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,552
-Feeling good.
-Good.

926
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,487
[Kris] What in the world?

927
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,956
Hey, Mom.

928
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,257
-I can't believe…
-[Kourtney] Do you know Don?

929
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,425
…you guys did this.

930
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,126
Do you know Don does Pilates?

931
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,730
And Pilates is gentle on your body,

932
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,865
but it's also such a great workout.

933
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,468
[Kris] Oh, my god, fantastic.

934
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,737
This is supposed to transform your body.

935
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,639
But don't forget, you got to take it easy.

936
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,874
[Kris] Wait, look at the…
you put your feet in these.

937
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,610
-[laughs]
-Oh, this is by Balanced Body?

938
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,311
-Thank you so much!
-[Scott] Yeah.

939
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,714
Your body is gonna be so on "fuegs."

940
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,282
-I'm excited.
-This is where your new chapter

941
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,683
of your life starts.

942
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,352
-Right here in this garage.
-In this garage.

943
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,520
[Kris] I push myself pretty hard,

944
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,122
-so I appreciate it.
-[Scott] Yeah.

945
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,690
And this is something
we could do together.

946
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,693
I may not be able to go zero to 60,

947
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,129
but this is the perfect balance
for my body.

948
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,898
[Kris] It's fantastic that I have a family

949
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,468
that really wants me
to be the best that I can be.

950
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,871
And I think that the fact
that they've gone this far

951
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,741
to surprise me means a lot.

952
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,576
This is so cool.

953
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,211
I have, like, my own Pilates studio.

954
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,979
I could charge you to come over.

955
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,180
[chuckles]

956
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,349

{\an8}[Khloé] <i>Well, well, well.</i>

958
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,393
-[Rob] Gabbana.
-What do we have here?

959
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,595
[Khloé] I got dressed up for you.

960
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:21,499
Got my whole arm wet for you.

961
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,967
[Khloé] No, two hands.

962
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,370
-Wait, I'm wet.
-It's okay.

963
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,938
[Rob groans]

964
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,273
[Khloé] Oh, Robbie.

965
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,811
You could give a normal hug.
Like, two hands is fine.

966
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,084
[Khloé] Would you like to sit
in my office?

967
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,890
So serious. What's happening?

968
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:51,896
I've missed you.

969
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,000
Well, why won't you even look at me?

970
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,201
Talk to me.

971
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,736

{\an8}[upbeat music]

973
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,179
I've missed you.

974
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,283
Well, why won't you even look at me?

975
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,517
Talk to me.

976
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,119
[Rob groans]

977
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,590
So I heard you and Scott
are having a baby or something.

978
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,325
-Rob, don't be weird.
-Okay.

979
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,794
[Khloé] I've been calling you,
I've texted you.

980
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,196
[laughs]
No, you have not.

981
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,797
Do you want to look at our text messages?

982
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,367
I'm pretty sure the last text messages,

983
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,801
uh, you blocked me.

984
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,002
That was when we were fighting.

985
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,071
And then I said, "I love you, I miss you,

986
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,207
I hope Chyna's having a good pregnancy."

987
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,274
-Yeah.
-And then you wrote,

988
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:38,476
"I love you, too," and that was it.

989
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,178
-When is she supposed to have a baby?
-In November.

990
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,880
You excited or nervous?

991
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,915
I'm excited, I'm not nervous.

992
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:47,852
[dog barks in distance]

993
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,254
Um, so, like, the more
you guys come around,

994
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,690
the easier it's gonna get,
but if the more you guys stay away,

995
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,358
it's just gonna stay this weird place.

996
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,994
-Or even make it weirder.
-[Rob] Yeah.

997
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,029
I just feel like the situation
is just, like,

998
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,265
not very welcoming for her to feel like,

999
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,601
"Oh, I should go be BFF with so and so."

1000
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,770
No, I think it should be natural anyway,
but--

1001
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:08,406
You know, obviously, I hang out
with her all the time, or--

1002
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,509
I know it's gonna be different,
like, obviously you have her.

1003
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,111
And even if that's your…
like, you don't have to bring her around,

1004
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,147
like, that's totally your choice, but…

1005
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,515
it's also not fair for you

1006
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,517
to, like, eliminate yourself
from our lives.

1007
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,685
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Like, my life at least.

1008
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,056
Like, you and I had such
a close relationship,

1009
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,392
and then for you just to,
like, disappear, that's like…

1010
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,628
No, I wouldn't wanna do that.

1011
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,897
And I would like to be there for you.

1012
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,598
Well, good.

1013
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,934
I just want everyone to be happy, so,

1014
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,669
you know, I need everyone else to be,

1015
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,638
like, on the same page.

1016
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,640
We'll get everyone together.

[Khloé] It feels so good
to have my brother back and in my life.

1019
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,982
Just, I feel so much more safe and just,

1020
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,985
like, at peace that he is here
and someone that I could talk to

1021
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,887
and call and lean on,
and just be that silly,

goofy brother that I always have.

1023
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,491
[Khloé] Me not talking to you
for months, that's weird.

1024
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,359
-Yeah.
-Like, that's never happened

1025
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,794
ever in my life before.

1026
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:05,863
Well…

1027
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,599
{\an8}I love you.

1028
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,733
{\an8}[chuckles softly]

1029
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:11,702
I love you, too.

1030
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,270
I'm really tired.

1031
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:15,806
Want to take a nap together?

1032
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,309
-Mm…

[Kim] <i>Next on</i> Keeping Up
with the Kardashians…

1034
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,180
[Kourtney] I'm at the Women
of the Year Awards.

1035
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,316
I just can't get on the stage and talk.

1036
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,819
What would be your dream birthday party

1037
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,754
that we could all do
to celebrate with you?

1038
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,857
Why doesn't everyone
just, like, call me and wish me

1039
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,225
-a happy birthday this year?
-No.

1040
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,494
I'm so glad you invited…

1041
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,496
I was invited, I was like, "Yay."

1042
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,564
Hey, Rob. How's Chyna?

1043
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:44,034
[Rob] <i>Um, I'm out of her house
and we're not living together.</i>
