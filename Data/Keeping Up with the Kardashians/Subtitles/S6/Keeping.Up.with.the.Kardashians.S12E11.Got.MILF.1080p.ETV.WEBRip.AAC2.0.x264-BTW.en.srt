1
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,232
Cute face for Mom.

2
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:27,399
- Cute face for Mom.
- Cute face.

3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,432
Cute face.
Ooh, yes.

4
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:31,432
Where did he learn that?

5
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:32,766
He just, like,
did it on his own.

6
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,099
And then we've been
saying it, so...

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,766
We were like,
"Make a cute face."

8
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:37,132
so now he, like,
will do it on command.

9
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:38,799
Shake your head.
Mase, you know, we used to say

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,799
that to you all the time.
"Shake your head."

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,132
And then we would say,
"Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you

12
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,332
boot."
That was, like, when we brought

13
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,332
you home from the hospital.
I had no idea how to treat

14
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,999
- a kid like you.
- You put me in the

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,366
garbage and then you let me
poop in it.

16
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,132
Yeah, I should put you
in the garbage and let you

17
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:54,166
poop all over the place, so I
wouldn't have to deal with it.

18
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,366
And Mommy was like, "You better
figure this out; figure out how"

19
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:59,432
to handle this kid."
I was like, "I'm only 25!

20
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,732
I don't know what to do!"

21
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:04,199
- I want to yell...
- Stop it!

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,199
How would I know what to do?

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,332
How?!
Tell me, man!

24
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,799
We're gonna put him back in the
garbage can where we found him.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,832
Right in Mom's... Mom's thing,
where you came from.

26
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,832
- Aah, Daddy!
- That's the garbage

27
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,900
- can?
- It's the Dumpster.

28
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:41,632
Let's snap before we

29
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:43,732
- take off.
- Yeah, totally.

30
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,566
- Hi.
- Hi.

31
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:47,799
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,932
- I guess we'll sit here.
- Yeah, I'll sit

33
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,932
- next to you.
- I am, like, so excited

34
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:53,932
- to go.
- Kim, it's been a

35
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,766
minute since we've been in Vegas
together.

36
00:01:55,767 --> 00:02:03,767
I'm really excited about it.

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,066
- Kimmy.
- Hi.

38
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,132
- How was the ride?
- I'm, like, so tired now.

39
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,832
Oh, yeah, I fell asleep.

40
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,099
It's, like, so annoying.
Stephanie, stand behind me,

41
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,299
'cause the back of my dress is
not it.

42
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,666
Like, my ass is so huge.
I still have, like, 25 pounds to

43
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:28,766
go.
The fact that I'm, like, doing

44
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,832
appearances, like, blows my
mind.

45
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,266
I was not even out of the house,
last time.

46
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:35,699
Last time, I had, like, 50
pounds to go.

47
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,332
I've definitely had my fair
share of the press just, you

48
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,966
know, attacking me over things
that they think are

49
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:46,099
inappropriate because I'm a mom.
Right before I got pregnant for

50
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,166
the second time, I posted a nude
selfie.

51
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:52,366
I mean, I was so proud of
myself; like, I had gotten in

52
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:54,666
such great shape.
But people had such a problem

53
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:58,732
- with it.
- I've watched 50

54
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,732
things on everything about this
today.

55
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,066
- Insane, right?
- That's the crazy

56
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,399
- part.
- It looked like I was

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,699
- wearing a bikini.
- Did Piers Morgan

58
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,332
- respond to you?
- He wrote, like, a whole

59
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:10,366
blog about why don't I try to be
successful with my clothes on.

60
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:13,399
Like, why don't you try to be
successful with your clothes

61
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,632
off?
It's actually really hard.

62
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:18,999
I'll never stop posting photos
that I like of myself.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,032
If anything, I feel more
empowered.

64
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,399
Like, if you're not into what
I'm posting, don't look.

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,666
I don't pay too much attention
to it.

66
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,566
- You look divine.
- Thank you.

67
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,366
Is this your first...?
This is your first... yeah.

68
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:31,366
Yeah, that's why they're
gonna be, like, so annoying.

69
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,699
Ten years from now,
you're gonna be, like,

70
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,999
"Oh, remember when I went to
Vegas?"

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,599
- Totally.
- "10,000 people came

72
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,500
to see me."

73
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:54,632
This is my first real
night out since I had, you know,

74
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:57,632
my baby, so it's gonna be a
fun night with all my friends.

75
00:03:57,633 --> 00:04:00,932
You do, like, spend so much time
prepping for a night out when

76
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:04,399
you, uh, are a mom.
I was able to, you know, put my

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,532
kids to bed, read them, you
know, their stories,

78
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:10,932
then go out, and, you know,
make it home before they wake

79
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,732
- up.
- Make some noise

80
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:16,199
for Kim Kardashian; Kardashian
in the right now!

81
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,066
What's up, kids?

82
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:24,232
I haven't been to Vegas for,

83
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:27,832
like, years, so I'm excited.
You guys have to show me a

84
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,000
good time.

85
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:48,066
What are you looking for?

86
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,899
I don't know.
Just seeing what kind of snack

87
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,532
- she has.
- How about a cookie?

88
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,899
- I'm scared to take one.
- Okay, this is

89
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,799
something that I rarely eat.
Kylie?

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,466
- Hmm?
- I'm making myself a

91
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,632
Pop-Tart.
Do you want one?

92
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:05,032
- I'm good.
- Hey.

93
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,866
- What are you guys doing?
- Making ourself at

94
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,632
- home.
- Making a Pop-Tart.

95
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:11,132
- Do you want one?
- A Pop-Tart?

96
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:13,399
- Yeah.
- You, who won't allow,

97
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,366
like, a plastic dish in
someone's kitchen, because God

98
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:18,666
forbid if it's not natural and
organic.

99
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,332
But I'm at Kylie's
house, and she had no healthy

100
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,999
snacks.
The only snack that sounded

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,266
- appetizing to me was a Pop-Tart.
- There's fruit right

102
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:29,166
- there.
- Yeah, there's lots of

103
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:30,666
healthy snacks.
There's tangerines...

104
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:32,699
Fine, I'll eat half
of the Pop-Tart, and then I'll

105
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,866
eat a pear, everyone,
so just relax.

106
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,699
- Eat a banana.
- Okay?

107
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,632
So, Kylie, I needed to
swing by, because I was down the

108
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,599
street.
What's going on with the

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,632
- stalker?
- He's out of the

110
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:47,299
- psychiatric ward.
- I know, but...

111
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,399
Is it the same stalker?

112
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,832
Yeah. It's a situation
where he didn't just get

113
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,166
released from the psychiatric
ward, I just found out that he

114
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:58,866
escaped from the psychiatric
ward.

115
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:02,866
And he really thinks that he can
just keep following her around

116
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:06,266
and coming to this community
and trying to get in.

117
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:11,299
- How crazy is that?
- I think we take our

118
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,166
security, like, really
seriously.

119
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:19,366
Kylie has had a few incidents
with stalker-type situations in

120
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:22,132
- the past.
- Oh,.

121
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,832
- What is it?
- This isn't funny.

122
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,966
- No, this is nuts.
- This is really weird.

123
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:29,966
"Will you marry me?"
She's 17.

124
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:33,166
There has been a
guy that's been following Kylie,

125
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:36,866
- and I am definitely worried.
- All right, you guys,

126
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,432
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you at

127
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:39,932
- dinner.
- You know, we had a dog

128
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,332
that we got, like, one of those
Forbes-trained German Shepherds.

129
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,099
But you have to learn, like,
German commands, which you

130
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,099
could easily learn, like, five
things in German.

131
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,799
You need, like, a mean dog.
What do you think, Kourt?

132
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,632
- What?
- Do you think I should

133
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:55,132
get this German Shepherd?
How cool would, like, our photos

134
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:59,432
be, like, of me and the dog?
I can tell the dog to sit here,

135
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:03,266
- and just have the dopest photos.
- If Kylie's just so

136
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:06,699
concerned that her dog's gonna
make great photos, like,

137
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,666
she's definitely not taking this
seriously.

138
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,666
I just think she needs to be
careful.

139
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,532
You want to come for me, bitch?

140
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,999
- Come for me.
- Bring it.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,533
It would be hilarious.

142
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,566
- Look what I have.
- Why do you have this

143
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,566
- already?
- Because I wanted

144
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,399
samples.
Would you like a gingerbread

145
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,232
- cookie?
- Not really.

146
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,832
Are you gonna see
the kids later?

147
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,432
I got Mason new clothes though.

148
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:41,132
- So cute. Is he into it?
- I got him a bunch of

149
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,032
vintage bombers, vintage
T-shirts.

150
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,632
I went to that What Comes
Around Goes Around, where,

151
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,699
- like...
- Oh, I need to, like,

152
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,166
brace you.
Kanye is going to shoot a music

153
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:54,932
video for this song "Famous."
And the people that the video's

154
00:07:54,933 --> 00:08:02,066
about, it's, like, Amber Rose,
Ray J, Chris Brown, Rihanna,

155
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:04,399
- Taylor Swift and Caitlyn.
- Caitlyn.

156
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,366
- Caitlyn?
- Caitlyn Jenner.

157
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:09,266
There's nudity, technically.
There's sheets over everyone.

158
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:12,332
I think he's obsessed
with Caitlyn though.

159
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,966
He just, like, likes
people that do... that are

160
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:17,399
authentic, that do what they
want to do.

161
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,732
Well, he wasn't doing
what he wanted to do his whole

162
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,266
- life.
- Yeah, but now he is.

163
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:25,966
I am still trying to
understand the whole... feud

164
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:29,532
between Taylor Swift and Ye that
happened about this whole song.

165
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,599
'Cause I thought she knew about
it.

166
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,199
She did, but she was
acting like she didn't.

167
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,966
But didn't they...
Weren't they, like, recording Ye

168
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,899
when he was talking to her for
his, like, blog?

169
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,199
For... no, like, for,
like, a documentary one day.

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,632
Kanye, every time he's recording
an album, he always has

171
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:49,466
videographers with him 24/7,
recording everything.

172
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,299
So Madison Square
Garden... nobody never heard it.

173
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,499
- It starts off Rihanna voice.
- That's the first

174
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,533
- song you're gonna play?
- Yeah.

175
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,000
Know me best
I feel like Taylor Swift might

176
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,766
It's really important to
him when he was writing this

177
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:39,566
song "Famous" that he, you know,
spoke to her, and they knew it

178
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:43,232
was gonna be controversial.
The camera crew filmed him

179
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,866
speaking to Taylor and got their
whole conversation.

180
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,532
So, I think he definitely
really, you know, cared about

181
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:50,866
how she felt.
I think she got freaked out by

182
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,899
the reaction, and all of a
sudden she flipped.

183
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,832
So many fake things that go on.

184
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,932
- So many fake things.
- It's just too much.

185
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:01,132
- He's just over it.
- It's like, why bother?

186
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,833
Yeah, why bother?

187
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,432
I have to do Fergie's video.
It's about MILFs.

188
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:13,366
Fergie asked me to be in the
video, and I've got to get it

189
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:16,666
- together.
- Kylie... you know how

190
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,099
she always tags her freakin'
location.

191
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,199
Even the police
told her to stop.

192
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,066
We really got to do
something that's gonna, like,

193
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,966
- terrify her.
- You know someone

194
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,999
recorded you when you were,
like, upset.

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,133
- Someone has the audio.
- I don't care.

196
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:46,132
- Kim, where are you?
- Hey, I'm in here.

197
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:49,099
My God, look at
this place. Jesus.

198
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,866
This is like a... this is a
store, by the way.

199
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,932
We could open up DASH Home
Collection.

200
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,332
That's just, like, what
I can fit me now.

201
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,132
Wow.
What's up with you?

202
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,266
You're, like, hiding in here.

203
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,566
I am going over all of
my e-mails.

204
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:07,232
I'm, like, so tired.
I have a cover to shoot that I

205
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,699
think I have to go to New York
for for a day.

206
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,799
- All right.
- It's, like, a big one.

207
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,866
Also, I have to do Fergie's
video.

208
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:18,766
- It's about MILFs.
- What are you gonna

209
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,366
- do?
- I don't know.

210
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:23,166
It's, like, she just wants,
like, her-her group of friends

211
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,299
- in it.
- Oh, that's fun.

212
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:33,300
Fergie and I have been
friends forever.

213
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:36,799
We're hanging out one day, and
she was playing me her music,

214
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,032
and I loved the song "MILF
Money," so she asked me to be in

215
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,332
the video, and I'm so excited.
I'm so honored.

216
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,899
It's gonna be so much fun.
I wish I had, like, a few more

217
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,566
- months.
- You say that all

218
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,999
the time, but you look great.
And nobody thinks you don't

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,699
look great.
You're good.

220
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,132
Now, does your butt shrink when
you lose weight?

221
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,432
- Yeah.
- Is that what

222
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:58,099
happens?
I just can't believe it shrinks

223
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,932
- from the weight.
- Like, it goes...

224
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:02,766
Yeah.
I measured it today, so...

225
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,667
What, do you do it
by watermelons?

226
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:24,199
You're a beast.
You drink tap water.

227
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,666
- Good for you. Calabasas...
- It's not tap water.

228
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:30,299
Oh, my God, okay.
Damn, girl, you rich in this

229
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,499
house.
So, what, like, it's already

230
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,266
- filtered?
- I don't know.

231
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:37,799
The whole house has a system.

232
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,532
- Hello.
- You sound like

233
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:42,466
- Adele when you answer the phone.
- I sound like a what?

234
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:44,399
- Adele.
- She doesn't know who

235
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,932
- Adele...
- What is going on?

236
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:50,032
Um, so, Kylie... you
know how she always posts.

237
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:53,432
And tags her freakin' location.

238
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,866
- Yeah.
- So, she, like...

239
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,899
- Her signatures are wild.
- Has a stalker.

240
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,932
Even the police told her to stop
posting, and she's still doing

241
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:05,066
it.
Kylie is so huge on social

242
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,732
media.
I think she's, like, one of the

243
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:10,399
most followed people on
Snapchat, which shows your

244
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,832
location instantly.
It's just... it's not safe, and

245
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:19,499
I want to make sure that, you
know, she is careful.

246
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,832
Yeah, I remember this
guy used to show up to every

247
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,399
appearance of mine.
And he was, like, mentally

248
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,832
disturbed.
And it was, like, so scary.

249
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,699
- Like, if anyone knows, we know.
- I don't think she

250
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,266
- realizes that we know.
- It's just, there's

251
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,799
- a way to talk to her.
- Wait, so what are you

252
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,999
- gonna do?
- We really got to do

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,832
something that's gonna, like,
terrify her, 'cause she's

254
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,732
obviously not taking it
seriously.

255
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,966
I feel like she'll
only learn that way.

256
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:43,199
Like, she won't listen.
Like, any time we tell her

257
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,666
anything, she wants to do the
opposite.

258
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,332
Should we get her held
up at gunpoint and we can dress

259
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,999
- up like...
- No.

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,732
I mean us, not a real person.

261
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,699
No, that's too crazy.

262
00:13:52,700 --> 00:14:00,700
That's the best form.

263
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,799
Okay, I'll call you back.

264
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,400
- Oh, my God.
- Bye.

265
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:11,667
There's new ones that I
haven't seen today.

266
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,867
Wait.

267
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:22,432
Hi.

268
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,199
Your eyes weirdly look big.

269
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,466
Yeah, my eyes look
bizarre, and I think

270
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,266
it's your phone.
Like, I thought the app was on.

271
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,966
So that's just what my eyes look
like?

272
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:31,632
Yeah.
We can't change that.

273
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:35,466
There's no filter for that.

274
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,666
- Hi.
- They have an audio

275
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:41,166
- recording.
- Shut the up.

276
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,666
- I'm not.
- Shut the up.

277
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,999
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
It's Kanye, hold on.

278
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,466
- Oh.
- Hey, babe.

279
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:52,199
Um, so, you know someone
recorded you.

280
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,866
- Okay.
- Um...

281
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:56,099
He said, "Okay."
When you were, like,

282
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,932
upset about Taylor.
The guy recorded the whole thing

283
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:02,332
- and someone has the audio.
- Uh-huh.

284
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,366
And you just, like, are,
like, upset.

285
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:08,399
I don't care.
Like, I was mad.

286
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,932
Is that illegal for them to
record me?

287
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,632
- Not in New York.
- See, that's what I'm

288
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,499
- talking about.
- Not in New York.

289
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,266
- Not in...
- Yeah, so, what-what...

290
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:18,666
I mean, does it start to seem
unfair now?

291
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,932
I mean, if you think it's a big
deal, I'm gonna follow your

292
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,466
- lead.
- I don't think it's a big

293
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:24,666
deal.
It's just the way the perception

294
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,566
- is.
- Well, yeah.

295
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,932
All right, let me see
what the team wants to do and

296
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:32,766
says and all that.
Not that you care, but I'm just

297
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:36,332
saying I care what people think.
I'm just like, my full-time job

298
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,599
is your publicist.
Kanye definitely just always,

299
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,466
like, speaks the truth, says
what he feels, says what he

300
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:44,699
wants.
He has no filter, he just says

301
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,032
what he, you know, believes in.
And some people might not

302
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:51,332
understand that, and so, like,
he has a bad guy reputation.

303
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,499
If you want to do
something to help it out or fix

304
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,266
- it, I'm down.
- Maybe just, like, lay

305
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:59,066
off Twitter for a little bit.
Let me see what the team says.

306
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:02,532
Usually, you know, I always try
to stay neutral, and, you know,

307
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:06,432
really think about where Kanye's
coming from and just, you know,

308
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,232
definitely try to give, like,
moral support and input.

309
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,532
Don't you think, like, I have to
think smarter for him?

310
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,066
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause he's gonna say,

311
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:15,366
"I don't care."
The wife of Pablo?

312
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:20,366
- The wife of Pablo.
- You look so good.

313
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:24,932
I'm having so much fun
doing this video with the girls.

314
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,266
We pulled your car up here.

315
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,132
- What's on my car?
- Uh, what is on your

316
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:29,566
- car?
- Who did that to your

317
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,732
- car. Is that your car?
- I am freaking out.

318
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's go look at it.

319
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,999
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

320
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,799
- I'm great.
- Nice to meet you.

321
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,632
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, my goodness, who is

322
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:53,866
- this?
- This is my baby.

323
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:56,532
- What's his name?
- This is Beelzebub.

324
00:16:56,533 --> 00:17:00,599
- Hey, welcome to my world.
- This is so cool.

325
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,466
B. Akerlund is an amazing
stylist, creative director.

326
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:10,699
She is doing the Fergie video.
So cool.

327
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,332
Love this.
I'm excited to meet with her

328
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,866
today and, you know, just see
what her vision is for me,

329
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:19,866
- 'cause I really have no idea.
- I mean, just to

330
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:22,366
give you, like, a general, like,
overlook of the video, we

331
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:25,899
really, like, want to, like,
lift up all the women.

332
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,466
If it's a woman breast-feeding,
or whatever they're doing, that,

333
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,732
I mean, they still look like
Vogue.

334
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,999
That's, like, so been my motto.

335
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,899
If anything, I felt, like,
sexier after becoming a mom.

336
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,266
I had a curvier body after
becoming a mom.

337
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,099
You can be hot and be a mom.

338
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,499
That's what the whole concept is
powerful moms.

339
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,866
And obviously you're one of
them, so we want to, you know,

340
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:49,032
showcase you and, sort of...
But I could show you.

341
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:52,332
So, we want you to have your own
"Got MILF" ad, which will, like,

342
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,066
pop up on the TV.
I don't know what speaks to

343
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:58,366
you the most as a person.
Like, if you had to explain

344
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:00,899
yourself in, like, three words
what would it be?

345
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,766
I hate describing myself, but...

346
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,966
I mean, I would definitely say
sexy is one of them.

347
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,899
- Mm-hmm.
- And I think, if I were

348
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,066
to do an ad like this, like, I
like the ones when the girls

349
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:13,832
are, like, wet and, like,
dripping milk on them, and,

350
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,266
- like, that vibe.
- Okay.

351
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:16,899
Should be in the shower.

352
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,799
Like, should we do a swimsuit?

353
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,799
- Yeah, I think so.
- Like, a special

354
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,099
- swimsuit that...
- Yeah.

355
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,366
Sucks everything in.

356
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:24,866
Do whatever you want with me.

357
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,499
- Okay.
- You know, just make me

358
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,766
look skinny.

359
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:32,299
Meeting with B., I definitely
know that I'm in really good

360
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,599
hands.
Like, she's got it.

361
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,032
Her references were insane.
What she's planning on having,

362
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,832
you know, custom-made is just
gonna look so good.

363
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,932
So I feel like this is gonna
be so major.

364
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,766
I'm-I'm really getting excited
now.

365
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:49,132
- Hello.
- Hi.

366
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:52,766
- Hey.
- I'm, like, obsessing.

367
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:55,832
I know.
It's gonna be so fun.

368
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,799
Well, you are in good hands with
B.

369
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,299
Uh, I can't wait to see what you
guys come up with.

370
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,432
- It's gonna be so good.
- She'll take the milk

371
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,832
shower, you'll take the milk
bath.

372
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,499
Okay, perfect.

373
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,932
- Yes.
- Perfect.

374
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:11,332
- Okay.
- Well, we'll get in a

375
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:19,333
bath together.

376
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,799
What are you gonna get?

377
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,399
- Salad?
- I have no idea if they

378
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,166
- have anything else.
- They do.

379
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:32,066
I mean, they have, like,
sandwiches and stuff.

380
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:35,132
I used to get a tuna sandwich
once in a while.

381
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:39,466
Okay, so while we're
at lunch, we're basically trying

382
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,332
to teach Kylie, like, a lesson.

383
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,999
And Kim... I swear to God.
Oh, it's Kim, speak of the

384
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,166
devil.
Hey.

385
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,099
Hey.
So, Steph is gonna come and

386
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,932
- she's gonna set it all up.
- Oh, my God, that's

387
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,766
amazing.
Okay, we'll be there distracting

388
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:54,566
- her.
- It'll be so good.

389
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:57,032
- So good.
- Because Kylie has

390
00:19:57,033 --> 00:20:01,999
been so casual about this
security issue, my sisters and I

391
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,799
decide to do a little prank on
her to give her a wake-up call.

392
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,466
I think Kylie needs to
understand that this is not a

393
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,966
- joke.
- We're gonna make sure,

394
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:14,399
like, when we walk out with her,
that we think, like...

395
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,899
That we're like...

396
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,432
- Like it's serious.
- And, like, make it

397
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,766
a serious thing, instead of
being like, "Ha-ha-ha-ha."

398
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:21,566
Right. She's not
gonna know, at this point,

399
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,532
- that it's us doing it.
- Yeah, we got to, like,

400
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,099
scare her into it.
She needs to take this

401
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,299
- seriously.
- Agreed.

402
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,599
I don't think it's a bad idea to
play a harmless prank on Kylie.

403
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,799
Hi. What a cute bag.
And hopefully, kind of scare her

404
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,066
a little.
I think just showing Kylie how

405
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:43,499
easy it is to reach her might,
like, rattle her up a little

406
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,332
- bit.
- Are you buying

407
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,566
- horny goat weed extract?
- Yeah.

408
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,066
- Mm-hmm.
- Horny goat weed

409
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:52,366
- extract... what is this?
- Yeah, I saw...

410
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,466
I saw "horny" and I got excited.

411
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,666
And then I saw "goat."
"Goat" made me

412
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,166
- really excited.
- Yeah.

413
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:06,167
And the "extract" part, yeah.
Oh.

414
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:10,766
- Cute.
- I'm not surprised

415
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:15,766
Kylie is Snapchatting and not
concerned about our location

416
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,799
being known.
And so this is exactly why we're

417
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,632
- doing the prank.
- Okay, Kourt, we got

418
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:26,666
- to go.
- Okay.

419
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,466
- Ky... where's Kylie?
- Say what?

420
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,367
Oh.

421
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,867
This way.

422
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,266
Right over here.

423
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,299
- My car? You moved it?
- Uh, Kourtney, we pulled

424
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,432
- your car up here.
- What's on my car?

425
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:46,099
Uh, what is on your car?

426
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,732
Who did that to your
car? Is that your car?

427
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,999
Oh, my God.
I have no idea what's going on.

428
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,332
I am freaking out.
I'm just gonna wait till they

429
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,866
- take it off.
- Come here.

430
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:56,899
- Let's go look at it.
- Why?

431
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,066
'Cause, let's go see what it is.

432
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,266
- You only live once.
- No, you guys did this.

433
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,966
It was nothing about us.

434
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:08,232
Very funny.
I can't really understand why

435
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:12,332
Kourtney would do this.
The paparazzi are definitely

436
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,866
gonna release these photos.
It's embarrassing.

437
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:23,867
Kylie.
Kylie.

438
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:29,299
- So Kourt.
- Huh?

439
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,566
What were you saying about fast?

440
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,732
I said some guys
jerk it, so they can last

441
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,666
- longer.
- Yeah, but I don't

442
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,166
think there's anything wrong
with that.

443
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,032
I'm not saying there is at all.

444
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:43,932
We're going to Hef's
at 12:30.

445
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:46,699
What do you do if you
bump into Taylor Swift tonight?

446
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,066
I don't know Taylor
Swift; why do I care?

447
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,166
Call Kim.

448
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:54,666
Okay.

449
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:57,066
Hi.
Uh, whatever happened with the

450
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:59,766
- Taylor Swift video?
- The clip is so good.

451
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:03,699
So the line, when she said, "I
made her famous," or whatever,

452
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,466
I heard she told everyone at the
table, like, "Well, I mean, it's"

453
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:08,632
true, whatever.
Kanye totally, like, made me

454
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:12,632
more famous."
And so that's what Kanye came

455
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:15,232
- up with the line, but whatever.
- So why don't you...?

456
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,599
I'll put it out.
What's wrong with you?

457
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,332
Yeah, but it's
like, why... I don't know.

458
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,866
'Cause, like, why do you even
want to get into this battle?

459
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:23,066
I just wanted to, like,
kind of stay out of it.

460
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,199
Don't let Khloe post it.

461
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,166
No, don't.
I don't want any of us to get

462
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:28,832
- involved.
- Yeah.

463
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:36,833
- Okay, bye.
- Kourt, come here.

464
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,066
I don't really feel like saying
much, because the Taylor Swift

465
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,932
fans love her, and I'm all for
that.

466
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:48,299
And all I know is, I saw the
video.

467
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,999
I heard Taylor, and I think that
Kanye did the right thing.

468
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,032
So please Taylor Swift fans,
don't kill me.

469
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,499
Who did your makeup?

470
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,232
That's not okay.
I know how it is when people

471
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:03,199
are, like, attacking your
husband, and I know that Kim

472
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,866
feels that Kanye did the
right thing.

473
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:06,966
You don't have to do that as a
songwriter.

474
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,766
You could really just say
whatever you want.

475
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:11,366
It's so easy to just go ahead
and attack Kanye, 'cause they

476
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,566
already perceive him in a
negative way anyway.

477
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:17,799
I really hate that he gets such
a bad rap for everything.

478
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,432
I mean, what do you think about
the video?

479
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:23,832
It's just funny.

480
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:27,232
- Everyone's so full of.
- So full of

481
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,167
that it pisses me off.

482
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,699
- Three, drop, good.
- I've got to get it

483
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,066
together, and get myself in
shape for this "MILF Money"

484
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:39,699
- music video.
- Yeah, come on, come on.

485
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,499
What is going on with Kylie?

486
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,766
She felt, like, really
disrespected.

487
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,499
Well, we were
trying to get her to take it

488
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,332
- seriously.
- Well, maybe there was a

489
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,500
better way to show her that.

490
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,666
- Hello, Don.
- How your body feeling?

491
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,699
Fine, but you know my quad.

492
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,732
- Right.
- We got to just see.

493
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:09,699
Mm-hmm.
Mind right, body ready.

494
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,699
Mentally zone in, focus.
I'm gonna start doing the, uh,

495
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,232
upper body with me.
So just cushion down, when

496
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,366
the arms go down, light jump.
Let's go.

497
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:21,566
One, drop.
Two, perfect.

498
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:24,699
Three, drop.
Good, four.

499
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,432
That's the pace I want.
Five, don't speed that up. Six.

500
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:30,432
I've got to get it
together, and get myself in

501
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:32,899
shape for this "MILF Money"
music video.

502
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,599
I'm really nervous though.
But if Chrissy can do this, and

503
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,132
she had a baby two weeks ago,
I definitely can get it

504
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:44,066
together, like, four months
later.

505
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:46,932
Four, cushion.
Five, cushion.

506
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:49,766
Let's go.
One, drop, up.

507
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,466
Two, drop.
Squeeze the arms.

508
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,999
- Good.
- You know, with Kim,

509
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,132
she just, like, you know, puts
being a mom first, but she takes

510
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:05,332
time to work out, eat well and
just feel her best.

511
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,299
Oh, the roll down.
Let me see this.

512
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,666
- Let's see it.
- I remember those days.

513
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:17,667
- Good job!
- Yeah. Come on, come on.

514
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:21,199
- Hey.
- Hi.

515
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,332
Hi, Reigny.
What are you doing?

516
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:27,299
Give me a little kiss.
Show me the face.

517
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,632
Did he do it?

518
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:31,832
Yes.
You're so cute.

519
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:35,166
How come you're so cute?
Show me the face.

520
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:38,366
Your mama used to do that.
Yeah.

521
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:43,899
You're so cute.
So what is going on with Kylie?

522
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,932
She was so upset.
Called me, hysterical, crying.

523
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:50,099
Said she never wanted to go out
and hang out with you guys

524
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,866
again, because she felt, like,
really disrespected.

525
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:54,632
And then we were
walking out to the car.

526
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:58,366
It just was a bad day.
There was so many people around,

527
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,332
so many paparazzi, and so I
think she was just like, "What's"

528
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,732
going on?" and then I was like,
"Come on, let's go to your car

529
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,566
and see it."
You know, I think she's

530
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:10,299
just young still and trying to
do so much, and she's got so

531
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,632
much on her plate.
It's still a really new, big

532
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,866
world for her because she just
turned 18, so she's got this

533
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:20,566
world of responsibility that
she's trying to get used to.

534
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:22,366
One of the things that's
stressing her out, and she

535
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:24,799
doesn't really talk about it at
all, is the whole stalker

536
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,832
situation.
She's had to change her whole

537
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:32,166
computer system, she's had to up
her security, hire more

538
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:36,332
bodyguards and get a new phone.
It's a lot to go through when

539
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,799
someone starts threatening your
existence and just the way you

540
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,132
live your life.
Everything had to change.

541
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:44,199
Well, we were
trying to get her to take it

542
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,332
- seriously, so hopefully she is.
- Well, maybe there was a

543
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:52,132
- better way to show her that.
- I do feel bad that

544
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:57,299
our idea to teach Kylie about
posting her location, you know,

545
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,866
it kind of freaked her out,
especially with so many people

546
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:02,799
around.
Everything about it went wrong.

547
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,699
And so, clearly, that was not
the best idea.

548
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,366
I just want you guys to
watch out for her because she is

549
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:13,932
the baby, and just be sensitive
to, you know, the fact that

550
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,832
- she's still growing up.
- Yeah.

551
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:18,932
Next time just get some
Silly String and call it a day.

552
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:20,833
Mm, sure.

553
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,799
- Hello.
- Oh, my God, you're

554
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,199
getting skinnier and skinnier.
Don't eat those cookies.

555
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,632
You won't... you don't need...
Like, you look so good.

556
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,332
Here, I'll split the difference.

557
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,199
I don't want it.
Why... that's how I know you're

558
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,299
not a real friend.
Real friends don't give friends

559
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,599
Vienna wafers.

560
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,799
I'm so nervous about the
Fergie video.

561
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,399
It's, like, called "MILF Money."
So it's gonna be, like, us,

562
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,299
like, walking with the big pram
strollers, like, down the street

563
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,199
in this neighborhood, and I'm
gonna be in, like, a "Got MILF"

564
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,499
ad, and then there's, like, a
diner, and then there's, like, a

565
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,932
- beauty salon, and...
- How cool.

566
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:00,999
There's, like, different
scenes, all with MILFs.

567
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,099
Well, you definitely
are a MILF right now.

568
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,066
- What other MILFs are in it?
- Chrissy Teigen.

569
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:08,699
Oh, duh.
That's fun that you guys all get

570
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,466
- to do that.
- Um, yeah, it'll be

571
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:13,732
really fun, but I have, like,
such anxiety.

572
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:15,832
You're really a crazy person.

573
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,099
You look so good.
I think better than you did

574
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,966
- before you had kids.
- I definitely am not at

575
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:25,799
my weight goal yet, but since
Fergie and I were friends before

576
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,399
we had kids, and now our kids
are friends and have playdates,

577
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,732
we totally get the mom struggle.
We get how hard it is to really

578
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:37,832
work out and feel good about
yourself again.

579
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:42,499
So I'm proud to be a part of
her, like, mom MILF pack and

580
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,132
music video.
I love the, like, message behind

581
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:48,199
it, and I would never miss it
for the world.

582
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,999
I mean, I think it's just, like,
we both, like, think it's, like,

583
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,266
super empowering to, you know,
have kids and then, like, still

584
00:29:55,267 --> 00:30:00,466
be a hot, sexy MILF, you know?
There's, like, the mommy-moms

585
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,999
- though that, like...
- Kourtney, at first,

586
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,532
- was the mommy-mom.
- Totally.

587
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:05,966
After Reign, she's
like, "I'm gonna be a MILF."

588
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:07,599
- Totally. She's a MILF.
- Thank God. I thought

589
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,532
- we lost her to the mommy-moms.
- Yeah, me, too.

590
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:12,766
I'm gonna FaceTime her again.

591
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:15,399
So I just have a

592
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,032
The first time I
FaceTimed you, was your phone

593
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:21,032
- near you?
- No, I didn't know

594
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:23,632
FaceTimed me. When?

595
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:25,799
I like your acting
abilities; you're good.

596
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,899
It was honest.
What are you doing?

597
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,766
Looking at this MILF.
Seriously, she looks so good.

598
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:33,532
- No joke.
- That is not a good

599
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:36,532
- angle, sorry.
- It's all good.

600
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,466
- Well, she...
- No, she's the

601
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:40,999
ultimate MILF.
She looks amazing, but that...

602
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,266
And I'm just keeping it real...
That angle was not what's up.

603
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:52,267
- Um...
- Love you. Got to go.

604
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,066
Hey.
So do you... yeah, do you want

605
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:01,099
hair up in, like, the rollers,
or do you want it, like, softly

606
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,299
- out and then we tie the bandana?
- We need va-va-voom.

607
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,932
We need pinup.
Should we give her a moosh?

608
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,232
A little beauty mark?

609
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:11,899
Chrissy has normal
hair and makeup.

610
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,132
I think we should, like,
try to, like, really make it

611
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,799
look normal Kate Moss-y hot.
Vogue.

612
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,866
Your brand.
Just be concerned about your

613
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:21,799
- brand.
- Like, thank God Kanye is

614
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,399
here, because he definitely says
what's on his mind, and he's

615
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,832
definitely not feeling the,
like, blonde wig with the red

616
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:30,932
lips.
I'm actually, like, happy that

617
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,266
he even said something, 'cause I
wouldn't have had the balls to.

618
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,099
So should we
just do our own thing?

619
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,166
I think so.
GQ.

620
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:44,399
And she was like, "What about
when Kanye said him and Taylor"

621
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,466
might still have sex?"
I just don't care really anymore

622
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:55,067
and I'm gonna say how I feel.
So wild.

623
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:05,399
Walking up, walking up.

624
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,866
Make a hole guys, coming in.
Make a hole, please.

625
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:10,099
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

626
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,399
How are you?
You look so good.

627
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,566
You look so good.

628
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,332
- Oh, yeah.
- Is that the diva Chrissy

629
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,532
- over there?
- Yeah.

630
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:22,266
- Such a diva.
- I know.

631
00:32:22,267 --> 00:32:24,167
She's been giving all day.

632
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,199
All right, here we go, team up.

633
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,499
All right, guys, can I...
Everybody start moving back.

634
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,066
Thank you, thank you.
Roll it!

635
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,266
- Rolling!
- And playback.

636
00:32:34,267 --> 00:32:37,767
There we go.

637
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,632
People always say the
word "MILF," and, you know, you

638
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:55,233
definitely hope that you become
one.

639
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,666
And everybody cleared off set.

640
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:07,366
Here we go, guys.

641
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:10,266
I feel like this song
and the message is just all

642
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:13,766
about, like, empowering women.
Once you become a mom, they want

643
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:16,699
to feel sexy, they want to feel
powerful, they want to feel like

644
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,299
they got their together.
They can be the best mom, have a

645
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,332
great career, be a great wife,
and that they just can do it

646
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:31,333
all.

647
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,432
Oh, my gosh, it's so beautiful.

648
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:41,066
- It's so beautiful.
- All right,

649
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:42,699
- let's rock it out, guys.
- I'm about to get in

650
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,266
this shower with you right now.

651
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:46,399
I'm like, get me in.
I want to touch.

652
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,267
And we're
rolling; play one.

653
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:03,099
Yes.

654
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,532
- Cut. Money.
- Kim Kardashian, it's

655
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:07,066
a wrap!

656
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:08,967
MILF!

657
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,066
Yeah, you really know what

658
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:15,166
you're doing on these sexy
shoots, girl.

659
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,899
I really have no idea.

660
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,066
Yeah, you do.
Babe.

661
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:21,332
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

662
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,266
I cannot wait to see this.

663
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:25,966
Thank you so much for
everything.

664
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:28,832
- We'll text you about this.
- Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:33,966
- Love you. See you later.
- You, too.

666
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:35,266
See you later.
Good stuff.

667
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:43,267
- Bye.
- Yup.

668
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:54,199
Cosmo interview coming up.

669
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,266
Do you get nervous for them?

670
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:59,032
I never did.
I'm like, "Why do I care?"

671
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:02,532
Yeah, who cares?
GQ.

672
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,099
- How was it?
- It was good.

673
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,966
She asked me questions like
Rob and Chyna, random O.J.

674
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:10,632
questions that no one really
asks me, but maybe 'cause that

675
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:13,199
show came out.
My publicist is gonna die.

676
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,166
She asked me how do I feel when
Kanye, like, raps about having

677
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:21,566
- sex with other girls.
- Mm-hmm.

678
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:22,967
GQ.

679
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,666
The interviewer straight
up asks me, like, how do I feel

680
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:37,932
that Kanye talked about having
sex with Taylor Swift.

681
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:40,732
I kind of just was really
truthful and said how I felt.

682
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:44,132
I never talk about
anyone, like, publicly, like,

683
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:47,999
especially in interviews, but I
was just like, "I've so had it."

684
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,599
I just felt like I wanted to,
like, defend him in it.

685
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,699
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause it's like, she

686
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,966
legitimately...
quote, says, "As soon as I get"

687
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:02,466
on that Grammy red carpet, I'm
gonna tell all the press, like,

688
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:04,632
I was in on it."
And then she just

689
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:08,199
- didn't like the reaction?
- Yeah, and, you know,

690
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,899
just another way to play the
victim.

691
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,832
Definitely got her a lot of
attention the first time.

692
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:16,766
I just don't think that he
should be punished for it still

693
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:20,266
to this day.
I feel like I've had it with

694
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:23,699
people blatantly treating my
husband a certain way and making

695
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,499
him look a certain way.
Kanye is always so honest and

696
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,699
speaks his mind, and, you know,
when we were first dating,

697
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,299
everyone would talk and
he always had my back.

698
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,466
At this point, I really don't
give a, so I'll do

699
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:37,899
whatever to protect my husband.
Yeah, Kanye, you know,

700
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,432
definitely, like, hurt her years
ago when he did that, and it

701
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,299
wasn't meant to be personal.
It could've been anyone.

702
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,366
'Cause, like, we all know that
"Single Ladies" was the biggest

703
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:50,699
- song of the year.
- Yeah.

704
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,699
So I think when she
didn't win, he just wanted to

705
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,666
- stand up for it.
- I'm so glad that

706
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:59,766
- you said the truth.
- Yeah, I'm just, like,

707
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,832
speaking the truth.
Like, he called her, spoke to

708
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,566
her.
She even helped him, like,

709
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:06,732
- rewrite.
- Yeah.

710
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:12,099
- It's so wild.
- What if you just called

711
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,899
- Taylor up?
- I'm just over it.

712
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,532
At this point, like, I know the
truth.

713
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:18,499
- Thank you for your advice.
- You're welcome.

714
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:25,000
But I'm not gonna take it.

715
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:35,366
You are so gorgeous.

716
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:38,899
I'm so lavender.
Is my boob hanging out the

717
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,199
- bottom?
- You are so

718
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,599
- gorgeous.
- You look so cute.

719
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,999
No filter?
You didn't...

720
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,599
I put a filter on it, you freak.

721
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,166
Oh, thank God.
I love your hair.

722
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:47,866
- Is my boob hanging out?
- No.

723
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:50,799
- I think lavender's your color.
- I think white's

724
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,932
- your color.
- What's going on?

725
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:55,466
Um...

726
00:37:55,467 --> 00:37:58,699
I just wanted to apologize for
that prank.

727
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,166
- Mm-hmm.
- I just don't think

728
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:04,032
that we realized, like, what a
scene... I feel like we should've

729
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,566
known the second we got there,
and there was, like, thousands

730
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:08,466
- of people outside.
- It was just too many

731
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:09,932
- people.
- It was too much to

732
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:12,199
do that, so we should've, like,
stopped it.

733
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,899
The restaurant to the
car situation when there's too

734
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,466
many fans and paparazzi is
already stressful.

735
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:18,899
And then the
balloons, and the guy was

736
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,632
videoing, and then, like, you
just, like, weren't sure, like,

737
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,832
who was in on it.
Like, it was just too much.

738
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:29,799
So, I just wanted to say sorry,
but I think it is, you know,

739
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,832
important to, like, take it
seriously with the stalker.

740
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:35,932
My new thing is, like, if I'm
out public with the snapping,

741
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:39,332
like, I'll turn to airplane mode
and then you post them later.

742
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:43,799
I always do that.
I take it seriously.

743
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,966
Good, yes, good.

744
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:49,732
I'm just not trying to
be, like, a hermit my whole

745
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:52,332
life, you know?
They can't stop me.

746
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,599
We can't be scared of these
things.

747
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:01,366
But I appreciate you being
concerned and apologizing.

748
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:05,132
Even though Kylie
is my younger sister, she's 18

749
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:08,232
years old.
I think sometimes we do forget

750
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:12,099
she is a mature adult.
We don't give her enough credit.

751
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,799
She is really smart, and I
realize she wouldn't put herself

752
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,766
in a dangerous situation.
She's being cautious, and I'm

753
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,667
really proud of her.

754
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:26,467
- Ah, this angle.
- Oh, it's a video.

755
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:44,666
- Hi. Hi.
- Where you going?

756
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,299
- You're going to London?
- For the day.

757
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,266
- Why?
- Because Kendall had a

758
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:51,866
really awful night last night
flying to Paris, 'cause she gets

759
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:55,466
- really bad panic attacks.
- Oh, come on.

760
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:57,632
- And anxiety.
- Seriously.

761
00:39:57,633 --> 00:39:59,299
I don't know what to do.

762
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,732
Wait, isn't it so funny
that people think Saint, like,

763
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,199
doesn't exist or something's
wrong with him 'cause I don't

764
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,499
- show pictures of him?
- I need to come over...

765
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,832
You need to move back here.
Enough is enough.

766
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,532
- Relax.
- No, I am.

767
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:15,666
I'm loving life.
Oh, my God, with Taylor Swift's

768
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,499
- team...
- How did this all start

769
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,532
- up again anyway?
- Just because I did an

770
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:23,599
GQ.
That's sitting

771
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,532
- right there?
- Yeah.

772
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,199
Thanks, you didn't read the
article.

773
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,066
- No.
- Well, if you had, you

774
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:32,799
- would've known.
- What would happen if

775
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,366
you just called Taylor up?
And just say, "What... just",

776
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:45,367
you know, what happened?
How did this go so south?"

777
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:50,632
How did this all start
up again anyway?

778
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:54,266
Just because I did an GQ.

779
00:40:54,267 --> 00:40:55,966
That's sitting right there?

780
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:58,166
Yeah.
Thanks, you didn't read the

781
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,732
- article.
- No.

782
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:01,799
Well, if you had, you
would've known.

783
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,399
What would happen if
you just called Taylor up?

784
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,566
And just say, "What... just,
you know, what happened?"

785
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:13,132
How did this go so south?"
I just, this is what I don't

786
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:17,499
understand, because truly I
really do like her, and I really

787
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,232
like her team, and I really like
her mom.

788
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:25,866
I guess I don't understand the
motivation to...

789
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:28,432
- flip so quickly.
- Me neither, especially

790
00:41:28,433 --> 00:41:32,632
'cause Kanye went, like, so far.
Like, no rapper is gonna call

791
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:35,032
someone that they're, like,
rapping about and get their

792
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:36,566
- permission.
- Yeah.

793
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:38,599
Like, he really wanted
to just, like, because they've

794
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,332
had their issues in the past,
like, he really did want to do

795
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,999
- the right thing.
- And be respectful.

796
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,932
Maybe she just took it the wrong
way.

797
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:48,132
I mean, at this point,
I'm just over it.

798
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:52,066
Like, yeah, am I annoyed that
people try to pin my husband as

799
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:54,899
this bad guy to, like, take
advantage a little bit?

800
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,299
But, at this point, like, I know
the truth, I know everyone

801
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,332
around me knows the truth, we
all do, so it is what it is.

802
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,599
You know, there's nothing we can
really do about it.

803
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,499
My advice is that you
give Taylor a call and try to

804
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,132
- make amends.
- Thank you for your

805
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:13,332
- lovely advice.
- You're welcome.

806
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:18,099
But I'm not going to take it.

807
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,599
Keeping Up with the
Kardashians...

808
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,066
Are you excited for Cuba?

809
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:23,899
It feels like we're in a dream.

810
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,232
Dorothy, you're not in
Canada anymore.

811
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:28,799
- Canada?
- Hey, Kylie.

812
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,232
- You look so cute and pretty.
- All my sisters are in

813
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:33,632
Cuba, and she doesn't know what
to do with herself.

814
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:35,432
Mom, you're acting a
