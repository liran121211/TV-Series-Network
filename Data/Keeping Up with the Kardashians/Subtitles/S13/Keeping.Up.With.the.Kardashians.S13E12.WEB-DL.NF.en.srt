00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,833
{\an8}[Kim] What's going on with you and Chyna?

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,533
{\an8}I've been pretty...
I've been pretty, like, upset.

3
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:12,300
{\an8}Right now, we're just each
pushing each other away.

4
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:15,000
{\an8}You built your foundation
on attraction and sex.

5
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:17,733
{\an8}And then you was like,
"Oh, crap, what do we do now?"

-[car horn honking]
-[Rob] What the [bleep]?

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,366
[Scott] I don't even understand.

8
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:33,233
[Rob] I do that all the time
to lame-ass [bleep] bum bitches like him.

9
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,700
-Are you kidding?! I hate...
-What did he do?

10
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:40,600
He just tried to come up next to me
and try and look in and be a weirdo.

11
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,966
A [bleep] Calabasas sticker boy.
What the [bleep]?!

12
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:48,633
Well, I should... Should I flash?
Nah. This feels crazy.

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,133
I hate people like him.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,166

[both laugh]

17
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:59,233
-What a [bleep].
-[Scott] He faced up on you.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,133
[Rob] He's such a loser.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,133
I hate [bleep]... Argh!

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,966
[both laugh]

21
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,666
-Go ahead.
-[Scott] Yeah, ramp it.

22
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:12,600
Oh! Did you not...? If nobody goes,
I wait until somebody goes.

23
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,833
-Like, I'm gonna wait again.
-[Scott laughs] Just for fun?

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,633
-[Rob] Watch.
-[Scott] What?

25
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,166
[Scott laughs]

26
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,766
[Rob] Let's just let all of them go by.

27

[horn honking]

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,233
I think you got to go eventually.

[upbeat dance music plays]

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,433
{\an8}[Kourtney] What's
New York weather? Is it that cold?

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,733
[Dani] It's snowing.

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,900
[Kim] Hey. Look at my shoes from...

33
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,666
-[Man] Hi.
-[Kim] Hi. How are you?

34
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,900
-...100 years ago.
-[Kim] I love those.

35
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:04,033
We just made an outfit with them.

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,933
[Kim] That's cute. Really cute.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,466
This is warmer things.
We haven't done this rack.

38
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:11,100
-[Kourtney] That's for the trip.
-[Kim] NYC?

39
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,700
-Or... yeah.
-[Kim] Or what?

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,966
[Kourtney] 'Cause I can't decide.

41
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:21,300
She's the most annoying,
indecisive person on the planet.

42
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,266
I asked Kourtney months ago

43
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,833
if she would come
to New York for Fashion Week.

44
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,766
She hasn't given me a solid answer.

45
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,233
-Do you need a decision?
-I'd have other people fly on the plane.

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,200
Right now, I'm flying, like, my Glam
and everyone else commercial

47
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,333
so that there's room for you.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,933
I'm just not gonna know
until the last minute.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,866
How can you live your life like that?

50
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:49,066
Kourtney is truly the most indecisive
person I've ever met in my entire life.

51
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:52,000
I haven't even decided
if I'm 100 percent going.

52
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:54,833
-Kim said she liked these drapes.
-You live here.

53
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,166
I can't decide.

54
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:59,033
You can't have people
book something and then change it.

55
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,266
Everything is all set, ready to go.

56
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,633
At this point,
it's just beyond frustrating.

57
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,600
I think I want to be home with the kids.

58
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,600
But then I feel like I want
to be there for Kanye.

59
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,000
I mean, if you can't decide,
then don't come.

60
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,700
[Kourtney] Mm...

61
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,233
-All right, so I think I'm gonna come.
[Kim] Okay.

62
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:19,200
Okay. Oh, yeah.

63
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:24,633
-[Kim chuckles]
-[Reign giggles]

64
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,500
[Mason] Reign. Crazy!

[dance music plays]

66
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:36,033
{\an8}[Jamel] Don't show up late.
Don't try to slide out early, Rob.

67
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,366
Focus, man.

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,266
-[Rob] Hey.
-[Gunnar] How's it going?

69
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,466
{\an8}-[Rob] Good to see you.
-[Jamel] You ready for this?

70
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,033
-[Gunnar] Are you good?
-[Rob] Yeah.

71
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,500
-[Rob grunts]
-[Gunnar] Are you on the market now?

72
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:52,333
Just got to know.
I'll put some feelers out there for you.

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,266
-Always put feelers out there.
-[Gunnar] No.

74
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,533
If you're spoken for,
I won't have you spoken to.

75
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,566
No, I'm not spoken for.

76
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:03,600
You're intentionally making me stare
at my sister's ass while I'm working out?

77
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:09,600
It could be interpreted that way,
but that's not how I intended it. [laughs]

78
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,066
-Walk it out.
-[Rob panting]

79
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,900
-[Gunnar] Having a baby changed your life?
-[Rob] It's cool.

80
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:17,600
When the baby's with me,
I, like, won't leave my house.

81
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,966
Everything's just on lockdown mode,
which is a good thing.

82
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:24,533
-That's how you're meant to raise a kid.
-[Rob] Yeah.

83
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,333
[Rob] <i>In the past, when I was depressed,</i>
<i>I disconnected from literally everyone.</i>

84
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,100
But I'm not gonna go back
to that, like, dark place.

85
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,200
I'm just gonna focus on trying
to be healthy. I'm in the gym.

86
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:40,066
And I'm working every day
and getting better lately.

87
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:42,533
I'm gonna change my shirt real quick.

88
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,233
He killed it. I mean, I'm not surprised.
I'm happily surprised, and...

89
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,833
There's something in there.

90
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,733

the <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>,

91

we're looking for that guy.
it's in there.

-[Gunnar] It's in there. See you Friday.
-All right.

93

-Wear something sexy.
-G, it was a pleasure. Have a great day.

-No, like, arm rest.
-[Stephanie] Feels like...

98
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:20,700
We're so excited. We're going
to New York for Fashion Week.

99
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:24,566
It'll be this fun sister trip. Kendall
will be there, Kylie will be there.

100

It'll just be so much fun.

We're still waiting on Kourt.
She's not here. Should I call her?

00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,300
Yeah.

-[Kourtney]<i> Hi.</i>

How far are you?

<i>just, like, telling me not to come.</i>

109

You need, like, serious therapy.

112
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:07,333

and pack a whole bag and then not come?

[Kourtney] <i>I can wear the outfits in L.A.</i>

114
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, but it's just so annoying
that you're this indecisive.

115
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:16,433
Are you gonna still pay
for half of this plane,

116
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,333
or are you now stiffing me with the whole
bill, since you decided to be indecisive?

pay for half the plane.

Everything was sold out
'cause it's Fashion Week.

123

We got a room for her that
it's, like, now stuck on my credit card.

124
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:44,466
How annoying. Ugh!

-[Simon] How is New York?

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,700
-Good. Mm-hm.
-[Simon] Good?

132
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:10,366
Everything's really thought out,
you know.

133
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,733
[Simon] Your new security team
is incredible.

134
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,733
-New security's great. On top of it.
-[Simon] That's so nice.

135
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,633
Yeah. So Rob called me last night.

136
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,433
Oh, God.

137
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,566
Him and Chyna don't talk or get along.

138
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:26,566
Like, he's not going to fight
with her on social media.

139
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,333
I think she'll be chill.
He'll be chill. I'm hopeful.

140
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,500
Is the weight still on him?

141
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:34,466
-He's dropped, like, 13 pounds.
-Okay.

142
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:37,733
-Even through all the turmoil with her?
-[Kim] Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

143
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,933
I know that Rob really wants
to keep his family together,

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,166
but I do think
that this is a good path for them,

145
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:46,466
so that they're both happy.

146
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,933
Everything's a life lesson.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,066
I just hope that they can be great parents
and just have a good relationship.

148
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:55,366
-He needs to move on from all that drama.
-[Kim] Mm-hm.

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,266
-[Simon] There's no...
-I hate it's olives.

150
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,266
-[Simon] Really?
-[Kim] Mm-hm.

151
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:06,533
-Oh, I do. I... I hate olives.
-Like, everyone loves them.

152
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,933
Uh-uh. It overtakes the entire salad.
It becomes an olive salad.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,500
Mm-hm.

154
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,000
[Jamel] You've got a big birthday soon.

155
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,966
If you could create something for yourself
for your birthday, what would it be?

156
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:28,633
Mm, something that's,
like, very important to me

157
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,466
would be to have, like,
that friendship with Chyna.

158
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,133
[Jamel] Yeah.

159
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,433
Like, it kills me to not be able
to at least speak and be friends.

160
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,633
-Yeah.
-[Rob] You know what I mean?

161
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,000
At least we should be able
to have that relationship

162
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,700
for the sake of our baby and each other.

163
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:49,300
I love her as a friend, so that's
important to me have that relationship.

164
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:54,833
I'll never accept the fact that we can't
at least be friends and have peace.

165
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,633
In order for you to effectively
communicate with her,

166
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,233
it's learning how to love
and communicate with yourself first.

167
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,200
Being good to yourself,
being a positive influence for yourself

168
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:05,600
and inspiring yourself.

169
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:09,333
When you do that, you create space
where you are comfortable being around,

170
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,533
then other people can be
comfortable being around you.

-Hi.

-You do?

174
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,366
-Yeah.
-Oh.

175
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,200
-Want to sit over there or here?
-Right here is great.

176
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:33,866
Yeah. [Kris sighs] You look so good.

177
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,233
-I thank you. So do you.
-How was Cleveland?

178
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,000
-Great. Yeah.
-Yeah? How's my little Tristan?

179
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:41,100
-He's so good.
-He has a game today.

180
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,600
-[Kris] He does?
-Yeah.

181
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,866
You know what I've been finding

182
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:48,333
that's been escalating
and escalating and escalating

183
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,566
is how [bleep] annoying Kourtney is
with, like, just doing anything.

184
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,333
This is what I go through
on a daily basis with her.

185
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,333
"Should I go to New York, or not?"

186
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,666
I've watched her spend three days

187
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:03,200
picking a paint color
as if it's her full-time job.

188
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:08,433
After hearing how Kourt bailed
on Kim for the whole New York thing,

189
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
it's, like, Kourt doesn't get
that her lack of decision-making

190
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:14,100
does affect other people.

191
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,800
I know she's meeting us here,
so I'm gonna pretend

192
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:20,933
that you and I are, like, driving
and we're not here yet.

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,866
I'll say: "We changed our mind.
We're going somewhere else."

194
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:27,033
-You're gonna [bleep] with her?
-She [bleep] with me on a daily basis.

-Oh, this is giving me life.
-She literally [bleep] with me.

but just take your ass over there.

200
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,366
[bleep] I'm going the wrong way now.

201
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,300
See you soon, beautiful.

202
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:50,766
I'm turning around now,
so I'll see you guys there in 15 minutes.

203
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,500
My bad, Suzanne.
Will you pull over for a second?

204
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:56,500
We changed to go to a different
restauran. Mom's on the phone.

We can go to any restaurant.

208

What's better
than pulling a prank on Kourt

and making her feel what it feels like

210
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,566
when someone is that indecisive?

00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:15,266
-Just let me know, and I'll be waiting.
-Okay, bye.

we're eating before her?

I'm hungry. It's 2:30 p.m.

We decided to actually stick
with Grissini's.

-We should have gone with our guts.
-[Kourtney] <i>Is that a joke?</i>

-We're here.
-[Kourtney] <i>What's wrong with you?</i>

229
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,166
She sounds pissed, and so I don't
really know if she's gonna think

230
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,933
this experiment is
as funny as I find it to be.

231
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:11,033
She's not exactly
the practical joke type, though.

232
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,200
She might kill you.

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,266

-[Khloe] Oh, Kourtney's here!

-Gluten-free.

You guys ate without me?

-We've been here for a while.
-You had me on a wild goose chase.

237
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:32,766
-I think it will teach you a lesson.
-[Kris laughs]

238
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,633
You had me driving in circles
because you thought it was funny?

239
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,266
How was that gonna teach me anything?

240
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:42,066
Why are you so indecisive
about single move in your life?

00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:45,333
When I ask Kourtney,
"Let's work out tomorrow."

242
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,033
She goes, "Basketball court or
your garage?" I go, "What do you think?"

243

"Let me just Google the weather."

244
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
-You are indecisive.
-[Khloe] So indecisive.

245

I know I'm indecisive. It's debilitating.

246
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,966
-Think about New York.
-[Kourtney] Exactly. It's debilitating.

247
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,200
You're debilitating me.

248

Either way, I'm not
gonna be happy with the answer.

249

-Mm-hm.

"debilitating," we should all have a shot.

-Debilitating.
-Debilitating. Drink up.

-[Rob] I could heard it in her voice.

It really did not make me happy.

'Cause that's a positive interaction, bro.

342

but if you say that you support her

343

you're not judgmental
about what she does...

344

[Rob] I don't know if I said
that to her where she heard it.

crazy. Of course she knows.

Everything's fine. I'm trying to,

00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,200
What's going on with Chyna?

510
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,900
I don't know.
We really just have stupid...

511
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:04,033
Well, like, we just communicate
very poorly, and that's...

512
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,733
-It's all dumb. Fights.
-Yeah.

513
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,900
I was just thinking
on how good of a relationship

514
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:13,933
you and my dad had

515
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,633
when you guys weren't together
and it wasn't awkward.

516
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,866
-There was no tension or anything.
-Right.

517
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:20,533
It was very, like, healthy.

518
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,933
I want to have the type of elationship
that you and my dad had,

519
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,833
'cause we all remember only positive.

520
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,766
-There's never anything negative, so...
-[Kris] Yeah.

521
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:32,166
Here's the thing.

522
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,500
-You were two years old.
-[Rob] Yeah.

523
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:37,700
It didn't happen right out the gate.

524
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:40,866
We were better best friends
than we were being married.

525
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:43,300
It took us 18 years to realize that.

526
00:28:43,366 --> 00:28:46,166
He was mad. I was mad.

527
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:51,366
But after everybody settled down,
it was a conscious decision to be adults

528
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,000
and be inclusive.

529
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:58,166
It would just kill me if I didn't have
that friendship and have that peace

530
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:00,966
between us for Dream and just in general.

531
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:04,166
You can get there,
especially with your attitude.

532
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:09,933
I think the fact you're thinking like this
is amazing. You're a good man.

533
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,033
For Rob to understand it does take
perseverance and determination

534
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,266
to get to the place
that Robert and I were,

535
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:24,533
and still is willing to work things out
with Chyna is truly remarkable.

536
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,566
Most people don't think
like you think, Rob.

537
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:31,433
They don't stop and go, "I need
to consciously make sure

538
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,533
that <i>we</i> put Dream first."

539
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,966
-[Rob] Mm-hmm.
-That means you and Chyna decide:

540
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,433
We'll be great parents.

541
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,133
Then once she gets to say,
"I want to go to Daddy's tonight,"

542
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,966
and you guys can be flexible like that...

543
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,700
-Yeah.
-...you'll raise an amazing daughter.

544
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:51,666

really, truly find a way to get there.

635
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:32,199
-[Kourtney grunts weakly]
-Try to dig a hole in it.

636
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:34,466
Hit it like you're mad. Hit it harder.

637
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:37,266
-[Khloe] Think about Scott, Kourtney!
-[Damien] Little harder.

638
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:40,300
[Kris] We got people trapped down here
We need rescue!

639
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:41,800
Let's get down.

640
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:44,000
There's not a spiral staircase somewhere?

641
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:45,433
Khloe, you can do it.

642
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,800
[Khloe exhales]

643
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:50,066
[Kris coughs] I'm dying!

644
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:53,266
Listen, God, you're not
gonna let me die this way.

645
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,833
-Yes!
-[bleep] a duck.

646
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,033
Argh! [Khloe laughs]

647
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,333
Oh, my God, I hate heights. Ooh!

648
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:06,066
-Oh, my God.
-[Kris] Come on, you got to go faster.

649
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:09,266
-[Kourtney] Yeah, Khloe!
-I did it!

650
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,533
-[Kris] It's burning up in here!
-Ready to go rescue someone?

651
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,366
[Khloe] Yes.

652
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:18,233
-[Kris] Kourtney!
-[Kourtney] I can't see!

653
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,933
-[Damien] Stay low.
-[Kourtney coughs]

654
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,066
-[Kris] It's really hot in here.
-[Kourtney] Stop complaining.

655
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:25,866
-[Khloe] Mom, come here.
-[Kris] I can't see anything.

656
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:28,933
Oh, Khloe saved me! Thank you.

657
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,066
Thank you. Thank you. Whoo!

658
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:33,333
Where's Kourtney?
I got to go in for my colleague.

659
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,600
-I found you.
-[Kourtney] Whoo!

660
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,700
-[Kris laughs]
-[Kourtney] That's what it's like?

661
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:39,300
-[Kris] Wow.
-[Kourtney] You can't see?

662
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:41,666
-Don't you get claustrophobic?
-That wasn't even hot.

663
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:44,000
-It's intense.
-Watch <i>Backdraft.</i>

664
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:46,000
You'll respect everybody so much more.

665
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:52,133
Don't you have a newfound
respect for our firefighters?

666
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
I do.

667
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:57,066
Like, it's way, way, way crazier
than I would've ever thought.

668
00:35:57,133 --> 00:36:00,300
I think, like, just the cool--
You didn't rescue your mom.

669
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,400
I was claustrophobic.

670
00:36:02,466 --> 00:36:04,933
Did you take pictures of me
and Khloe in our gear?

671
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,233
'Cause that's what you're worried about.

672
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,666
[Kris] Kourt, turn around.

673
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,833
[Khloe] Do you have
any petite firefighters?

674
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,033
There's a lot of girls
that are petite that are on the job.

675
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,266
[Khloe] Like, I don't know
what this one would do.

676
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:28,300
-[Dream cooing]
-[Chyna] Ooh.

677
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:30,866
-[Chyna] Hey, Rob.
-[Rob] What's good, what's good?

678
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:33,766
Hey, what's good, what's good?

679
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,433
[Chyna makes whooshing noise]

680
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,966
[Rob] She's comfortable right there.

681
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:46,633
-[nurse] Four months already?
-[Chyna] Mm-hm.

682
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,700
[nurse] Let's go weigh in
those cute cheeks you have, huh?

683
00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:50,766
Right down here.

684
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:54,200
We can come on down.
Let's see how big you're getting.

685
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:56,300
How much everybody's carrying around.

686
00:36:56,366 --> 00:37:00,733
Ooh. 16, two and a half. Okay, perfect.

687
00:37:01,433 --> 00:37:03,966
Leave her just like that
and Dr. Peter will be in.

688
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:06,066
[Rob] Okay, thank you.
[blows raspberry]

689
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,300
-[Dr. Peter] Hi, Rob.
-[Rob] Dr. Peter.

690
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:10,266
-[Dr. Peter] How are you, sir?
-[Rob] How are you?

691
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,166
-[Dr. Peter] Nice to see you.
-You, too.

692
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:14,966
-[Dr. Peter] Dream.
-[Rob and Chyna] Dream.

693
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,366
[Dr. Peter] We've come
full circle with Rob.

694
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:18,900
[Rob] Yeah.

695
00:37:18,966 --> 00:37:21,166
Just gonna listen to your heart.

696
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,700
Give me a little tummy time.

697
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,633
Who's that?

698
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:29,533
She's a ten.

699
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,800
So she's gonna get
a Prevnar vaccine and a polio vaccine.

700
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:35,766
-But she looks great.
-[Rob] Thank you.

701
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:38,866
[Rob whispers] Kiss her stomach.

702
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,600
[Rob] Kiss her stomach.

703
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,833
[Rob] Ooh, yeah.

704
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,200
[Chyna] She's a baby. Kick, kick.

705
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:52,533
-[Rob] Kick 'em, kick.
-[Chyna] Kick me. Kick, kick.

706
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:57,033
-Dream, kick, kick.
-[Rob] Yeah. Good job.

707
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,066
I'm sorry.

708
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:00,766
[nurse] Only a little pinch. I'm sorry.

709
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,500
-I'm sorry, baby.
-[Chyna] Ooh.

710
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:05,000
-[Rob] Sorry.
-[nurse] That's it. Look how good you did.

711
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:08,100
-[Rob] I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-[Chyna] She didn't even cry.

712
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:10,533
-[nurse] You're awesome.
-[Rob] I'm sorry, baby.

713
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,000
-[Chyna] Dream, look at me!
-[Rob] I'm sorry.

714
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,833
-[Dream cries]
-I'm sorry.

715
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,400
[nurse] That one
stings a little. All done.

716
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:22,000
-[Rob] I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-[Chyna] It's okay.

717
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,366
-[nurse] All right, you're all set.
-[Rob] Yeah.

718
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:30,400
I hate that our relationship
is a little uncomfortable,

719
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:34,000
but I'm very committed to building
the friendship between Chyna and I

720
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:37,433
because the type
of relationship I had with my dad,

721
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,600
I want to have that with my daughter.

722
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:42,900
I'm just trying to do the best
for my baby, uh, Dream,

723
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:45,566
'cause everything I'm doing is for her.

724
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:48,366
-[Dream squeals]
-[Rob] That's so cute.

725
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:50,500
-I'm sorry.
-[Chyna] It's okay.

726
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:52,366
Easy-peezy.

727
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:03,166
-[door closes]
-[Kourtney] Greetings, earthling.

728
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:06,900
-Ooh, "earthling."
-Do I see a protein smoothie?

729
00:39:06,966 --> 00:39:09,300
-Keeks, there's a protein smoothie I made.
-Is there extra?

730
00:39:09,366 --> 00:39:12,000
-[Khloe] Right there.
-Good. Where are your cups?

731
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:14,933
-Where they've always been.
-[Kim] I've never used a cup.

732
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:17,700
[Kourtney] So, couple things.

733
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:20,500
Clearly, my indecisiveness
is affecting everyone,

734
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:24,033
and talking about it
with you and you and Mom

735
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,400
and doing all these exercises
made me realize

736
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:30,400
that I want to do
something to be more decisive.

737
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:36,466
So, last night, I watched
the Tony Robbins documentary,

738
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:39,633
and I feel like it helped me
get to the root of it.

739
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:44,533
I feel like Scott and I were
very codependent,

740
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,800
and I just would
always bounce every idea off of him.

741
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:53,033
Also, I'm just, like,
living a different life now,

742
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,600
where doing more
for myself is, like, an option.

743
00:39:56,666 --> 00:40:00,033
And now that I am able
to make my own decisions,

744
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,333
I want to make the best decisions.

745
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,633
Tony Robbins taught me
to make decisions from the heart

746
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,133
and not from your head.

747
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,266
And, like I said, I had
a million reasons to justify

748
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:18,500
going to New York, but in my heart,
it was telling me to stay home,

749
00:40:18,566 --> 00:40:21,666
so I want to start, you know, listening.

750
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:27,000
[Khloe] I am really proud
of you for, like, addressing this head-on

751
00:40:27,066 --> 00:40:31,066
and taking control over something
that was debilitating to you.

752
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:34,133
It's, like, that shows that
you're good at making decisions.

753
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,400
We did have, I think, a lot
of fun trying to figure out

754
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:39,966
why she's so indecisive,

755
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:44,933
{\an8}but I'm really proud of Kourt for making
the steps in the right direction.

756
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,700
{\an8}I hope eventually she won't have this
debilitating indecisiveness about her.

757
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:52,000
Thank you, Tony.

758
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,833
[Kourtney] Thank you, Tony.

759
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,000
[Kim]<i> Coming up next week...</i>

760
00:40:58,066 --> 00:40:59,566
[Caitlyn] Jay Leno, in the house.

761
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:03,066
Should I be concerned?
My daughter leaving with an older man?

762
00:41:03,766 --> 00:41:06,200
-Nice thing is they don't get much older.
-[Caitlyn laughs]

763
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:07,766
[Kendall] I met this guy.

764
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:11,033
He's the first gay prince
to come out in India.

765
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,100
There are similarities between
Prince Manvendra's stories

766
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,400
and my parents' stories.

767
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:18,233
-I read Caitlyn's book.
-Stop.

768
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,200
-Yeah.
-And?

769
00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:22,333
Everything is always your fault.
