00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:06,500
{\an8}[Kim] After Paris,

2
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:08,466
{\an8}one of my first things is going to Dubai

3
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,266
{\an8}and doing this master class.

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,800
{\an8}If I don't make it out alive,

5
00:00:11,866 --> 00:00:13,433
{\an8}just tell my family I love them.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
{\an8}My anxiety is so high, and I feel like,

7
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:17,866
{\an8}"Is this really what I should be doing?"

8
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:19,966
{\an8}[cheering]

9
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:21,266
{\an8}[Man1] Make some noise!

10
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,533
{\an8}Scott Disick!

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,866
{\an8}[Scott] I'm in Dubai and I found out
that Kourtney was with somebody.

12
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:27,700
{\an8}This is the worst thing

13
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,266
{\an8}I could ever hear.

14
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:31,333
{\an8}[Kim] I know it bothers him.

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,233
{\an8}Scott starts texting me about Kourtney,

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,766
{\an8}and I feel so bad for him.

17
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,933
{\an8}It just really sucks,
'cause he's been doing amazing.

18
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,600
{\an8}-Whose purse is that?
-[Chris] I don't know.

19
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,800
{\an8}[Kim] Girls are here?

20
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:43,300
{\an8}Should we go in

21
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,933
{\an8}and scare the [bleep] out of her?

22
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:50,166
[theme music playing]

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,966
{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

24
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,500
{\an8}[Kim] Or do you think we should go
bang down the bathroom door

25
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:02,400
{\an8}and see what [bleep] whore is in there?

26
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:03,833
{\an8}Should we go in there?

27
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:11,666
What the [bleep] are you doing here?

28
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,000
Seriously?

29
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:17,566
You're just like a [bleep] whore.

30
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:18,733
Such a tramp.

31
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,800
Get your [bleep]
and get the [bleep] out of here.

32
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:25,800
[bleep] groupie.

33
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:27,200
Get your [bleep],

34
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:28,733
and security will escort you

35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,000
the [bleep] out of here!

36
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:32,000
[door shuts]

37
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,033
Hey, we're gonna go.

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,400
And I just think it's better

39
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,866
that we go by ourselves.

40
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,566
-What?
-We'll talk about it later.

41
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:43,466
But I'm gonna go

42
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,200
and enjoy the rest of my time
in the desert.

43
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:47,200
I don't think we need to talk
in front of everyone.

44
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,666
What are you even talking about?

45
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,233
What am I talking about?

46
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,733
The [bleep] girl in your room.

47
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:55,966
I don't want to feel sympathy for you
after you feel bad about Kourt.

48
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,200
[Scott] She's made it clear

49
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:58,400
that we're not together.

50
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,166
[Kim] But you made me feel

51
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,033
really bad about it and you're--

52
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,033
Feel bad about what?

53
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,733
[Kim] I don't want
to feel sympathy for you

54
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,266
'cause you felt bad that my sister,

55
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,266
there was a rumor of her
hanging out with a guy.

56
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,266
It was not a rumor.

57
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,133
Why do you care what Kourtney does

58
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,933
or why are you even getting mad at her

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,733
if you're doing the same thing?

60
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,000
[Security] I'll get your stuff.
Go out the door.

61
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,600
[Carla] You're so disgusting.

62
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,133
[Security] Let me grab her purse.

63
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,533
[chuckling] This is bad.

64
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:29,400
[Kim] Whatever.

65
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:30,766
I just don't want to be involved.

66
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:31,866
It's just not my style.

67
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,300
The last thing I want to do

68
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:36,166
is be in the middle of this right now.

69
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:38,433
And I just… I feel so duped.

70
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,533
Like, he made me feel so bad

71
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,300
about their situation.

72
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,466
But he's, like, living life

73
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:44,966
doing whatever he wants to do.

74
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,700
[Jen] How did you get the bathroom open?

75
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,500
[Kim] It was open.
She was about to come out,

76
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:50,200
'cause she heard the elevator.

77
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,433
[Simon] My heart is pounding

78
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
from all that excitement.

79
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,966
Okay, let me call Kanye back.

80
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,333
[line ringing]

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,266
Hey, babe, are you awake?

82
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,933
I just caught a girl in Scott's room

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and went so [bleep] ghetto on her.

84
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,266
All of my friends…

85
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,866
like, literally, jaws dropped.

86
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,200
Like, who is this ghetto girl?

87
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:10,100
Like, Stephanie and I are, like, shaking.

88
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,666
I'll tell you all when you're awake.

89
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,833
Go back to bed.

90
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:14,566
Okay, love you. Bye.

91
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,533
I did see her shaking.

92
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,733
-[Kim] No, trembling.
-Yeah.

93
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,333
Wait, I'm calling Kourtney.

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,900
-Just wait till 7:00.
-Till 7:00, yeah.

95
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,666
-[Jen] It's 4:00 in the morning.
-'Kay.

96
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:24,933
Ooh, that girl does not know

97
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,366
what just hit her, man.

98
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:28,833
[Kim sniffing] Ugh, I felt…

99
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,300
I need deodorant.

100
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,466
I forgot to put on deodorant.

101
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:33,400
That's what it is.

102
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:34,933
After I showered this morning.

103
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,166
[Simon chuckles] How bad?

104
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:38,066
Bad.

105
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,100
Like a man?

106
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,900
[Carla] This is
because you were being so you?

107
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,333
Smell it. It's so gross.

108
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,600
[Simon] Oh, my God, Steph!

109
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,033
[Stephanie] You don't smell!

110
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,300

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,366
[Simon] Oh, my goodness. Yes.

113
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,866
Yes.

114
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:59,533
[Oriental upbeat music continues]

115
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,100
[Kim] Can I take a picture?

116
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,000
[Carla] Kim, you want to hold it?

117
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,700
Should I? I'm afraid.

118
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,233
[Stephanie] You got it, you got it. Yes.

119
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,533
[Kim] Even though I am so pissed at Scott,

120
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm just gonna not think about it--

121
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,566
not think about this girl,

122
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:15,400
not think about Scott being wasted,

123
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:17,300
not think about
what I'm gonna say to Kourt

124
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:18,566
and have fun with my friends.

125
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,633
[Stephanie] All right.

126
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,766
[chuckling] Ooh, my God!

127
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,866
Ooh.

129
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,766
-[Kim] Which one am I going in?
-[Carla] Yeah. I don't go fast.

130
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,333
[Simon] This is beyond, by the way.

131

-Yes!

[Carla] So dope. [sighs]

140
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,533
[Simon] Guys, how was it?

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,866
-[Carla] So fun.
-[Jen] Scary.

142
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,933
[Simon] This angle's nice
'cause you see the sand.

143
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,300
[Man3] Three, two…

144

[camera shutter clicks]

145

[Simon] Oh, my God,

146
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,900
-this is literally wild.
-[Jen] You guys,

147
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:05,100
-it's the cover of our album.
-[Simon] Cover.

148
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,433
-Yes.
-[Stephanie] Oh, my God, I love it.

149
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,733
[Kim] I'm glad we did it.

[Simon] Oh, I reek.

153
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,400
[Carla] Kim's armpits.

154
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,700
[Kim] No, my armpits don't smell anymore.

[phone rings]

157
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:27,833
[Kim] Kourt's calling.

158
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,800
Hey.

159
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:30,733
I feel bad.

160
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,266
Like, I do feel bad
for yelling at the girl

161
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,166
and scaring her

162
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,800
and pulling her out of the bathroom.

163
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,666
You know, like, that part,

164
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,700
she's definitely traumatized.

-[Kim] Yeah.

00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,066
-Yeah.
<i>-Okay, good.</i>

180
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,200
<i>I have a full nother day without him.</i>

181
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:14,166
[Kim] I think that Kourtney always had
this thought in her mind

182
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,533
that she wanted him to be sober

183
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,766
and then she would consider
getting back with him.

184
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,466
I know she wanted him to do that

185
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,900
for himself first.

186
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:22,733
And it's really not fair for Scott

187
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,200
to hang this guilt over Kourtney.

188
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:25,600
This has nothing to do with her.

189
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,666
[Kourtney] <i>I feel like we just need</i>
<i>to figure out a better way</i>

190
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,700
<i>to, like, separate our stuff.</i>

191
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,866
<i>Like, I don't need to deal with</i>
<i>this nonsense any longer.</i>

192
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,100
Yeah, you don't.

[Mariam] Hi. How are you?

195

Mariam. I'm the director.

-Kim. Nice to meet you.

197
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
It's a pleasure.

198
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,366
Thank you. Thank you.

[Kim] While I'm in Dubai,

203
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,600
I had this trip planned

204
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,866
to a children's hospital

205
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,666
and care center for the disabled.

206
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:09,366
I really want to explore the culture.

207
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:10,666
And I love

208
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,733
that there's, you know, really good people
in this world

209
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,566
that do really positive things.

210
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,200
It's such an amazing program.

211
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,033
[Mariam] Oh, my God, who's she?

212
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,433
[Student1] It's Kim Kardashian!

213
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:25,500
I made it with a sandwich wrapper.

214
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:28,600
[Student2] We made cookies in the workshop

215
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,966
and cakes.

216
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,366
[Mariam] Making cookies
in the workshop, yes.

217
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:34,266
[Kim] Oh, my gosh, amazing. Thank you.

218
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,166
You made this? Thank you.

219
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:37,566
Nice to meet you.

220
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,300

225
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,266
[Kim] I was really nervous

226
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,333
coming on this trip,

227
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
but I'm glad that I'm taking the steps

228
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,700
and making the moves to, you know,

229
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:01,966
slowly get my life back on track

230
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,566
and feel comfortable and safe.

232
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,566
Seeing these children

236
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,633
it's so heartwarming.

241
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:27,866
[Kim] Hello?

242
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:29,466
-[Scott] Hey.
-[Kim] Hey.

243
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:37,000
Scott just texted me
that he wants to talk about what happened.

244
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,033
And I'm just, like, angry and annoyed.

245
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,200
It's gonna be so awkward.

246
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,900
Ugh, I hate confrontation.

247
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,766
[Scott] Forget about our confrontation.

248
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:47,533
You got into, like, a full fight
with somebody for no reason.

249
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,433
[Kim] But, like, I didn't know what to do.

250
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,200
Like, I just… It was my first reaction,

251
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,266
you know what I mean?

252
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,400
-I don't know…
-Yeah. I spoke to Kourtney about it.

253
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,966
Kourtney was like, "I have no intentions

254
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,033
of us working things out, really."

255
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,766
"I want to live my life, you live yours."

256
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,233
And I'm like, "I would've loved
to have just been with you and that's it.

257
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,066
But that's not what you want,
and that's fine.

258
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,966
But you just weren't honest and told me."

259
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,166
And I'm not even trying to play games.

260
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:13,366
But, yeah, I'm not gonna lie,

261
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:14,900
it's hard to [bleep] sleep at night.

262
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,800
You know what I'm saying?

263
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,233
So I'm like, "[bleep]."

264
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,533
Puts me in a weird position.

265
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,433
I don't want
to be doing half this [bleep],

266
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
but I don't know
what else to [bleep] do with my time

267
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:24,966
to take my mind off of it.

268
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,300
I don't want to be in the middle,

269
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,700
and I don't want to be
like, "I have to tell Kourtney,"

270
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,133
'cause I have to tell Kourtney.
You know what I mean?

271
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,533
I don't want things to be awkward,

272
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
but I don't want to feel bad.

273
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:39,333
She never, ever gives me

274
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,733
any kind of pat on the back for anything.

275
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,300
Yeah.

276
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,200
The only time I hear from her,

277
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:47,666
if it's something negative.

278
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,633
The second she hears

279
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
that she's got something
to be mad at me for,

280
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:54,100
she then calls me

281
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,733
and then actually talks to me.

282
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:04,966
[dance music playing]

283
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:12,433
[Kourtney] Hi, guys.

284
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,366
I didn't know I had the pleasure

285
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,266
to eat with both of you guys.

286
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,333
Yeah.

287
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,533
[Kim] How are you?

288
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
[Kourtney] Good. Tired?

289
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,733
-[Kanye] Is that the chai tea?
-[Kim] Yeah. I'm gonna sweeten it up.

290
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,366
[Kourtney] You guys ever had Matcha?

291
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,300
No. What's Matcha?

292
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:29,466
It's, like, green tea,

293
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:30,633
but more caffeine.

294
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,633
Mm-hmm.

295
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,700
I mean, I don't want
to start anything, but…

296
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:35,833
What?

297
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,133
[Kim] Scott was so out of it in Dubai.

298
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
He was sitting up there.

299
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,566
-Didn't try to save this girl to--
-But did he say anything?

300
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,000
Did he say, "Don't go down…?"

301
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,933
No, not a thing. Didn't even flinch.

302
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,800
-Didn't even care.
-Yeah.

303
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,300
But then, Scott and I had
a really good talk.

304
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:51,700
He was like, "I don't plan on drinking
when I get home."

305
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:54,200
Think it was just a quick, little thing.

306
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:57,033
I don't know. I guess we'll see.
But I can tell when he's a little off.

307
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,733
But I did call him, and I said,

308
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,866
"Hey, I heard what happened,
and I don't care,

309
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:05,300
so just, you need to stop trying

310
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,600
to make me feel bad for anything I'm doing

311
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,266
and make everyone else try to feel bad."

312
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,500
But I do think where you go wrong…

313
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:12,400
[Kourtney] Mm-hmm.

314
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,433
…is you go to Cabo with him,

315
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,366
you go to Aspen with him,
and he thinks he's trying to impress you.

316
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:18,933
-Mm-hmm. Right.
-He gets the check,

317
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,566
he gets the this, he has the security.

318
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,966
I mean, he tells me like,
"Oh, we had such a nice time."

319
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:24,733
-You'll watch a movie with him.
-But I said,

320
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,366
"You have the best of both worlds.

321
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,333
I could do my thing,
and you could do your thing."

322
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
"What a great scenario."

323
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,100
To be honest, if Scott
got his [bleep] together,

324
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,600
I feel like you would be with him.

325
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,433
Yeah, it is your baby daddy of three.

326
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,800
[Kourtney] Yeah. But, you know,

327
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,433
it's his fault we're not together.

328
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,100
[Kim] Yeah.

329
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,800
What do you think of this guy?

330
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:46,033
[Kourtney] But aren't those
the kind of dogs that die right away?

331
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,166
They're literally that big.

332
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,033
-They only get up to three pounds.
-[Kanye] Are they called "Pomeranians"

333
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,966
-'cause they fit in your palm?
-[chuckling] No.

334
00:11:54,733 --> 00:12:01,266
[upbeat music playing]

335
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,000
[door opens, closes]

336
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:07,066
Hello.

337
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:08,733
Hello?

338
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:11,000
Um, squad goals.

339
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,666
What the [bleep] is this?

340
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:13,833
[Simone] Isn't that…?

341
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,133
No, it's a… It goes up.

342
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,133
It's literally like a cool jockey strap.

343
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,066
[Simone] Yeah, that… It's like… it's like…

344
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,033
[Khloe] You don't want me
in your fittings, I know, Simone.

345
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,666
-[Simone] No. I…
-[Khloe] I know.

346
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,100
The fact that Simone
still hangs out with you,

347
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,500
and you basically got her killed is wild.

348
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:31,000
-My God! Khloe.
-[Kim] You know what?

349
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,700
But had help come sooner,

350
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:34,000
they would have been killed.

351
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:34,900
[Khloe] I know.

352
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,366
-[Kim] So…
-[Khloe] Yeezy balls.

353
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:39,466
-I like that jacket.
-Oh, me, too, darling.

354
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,333
Thanks for designing it.

355
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:45,166
So, this isn't, like,
your trip-packing, right?

356
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,600
-[Kim] No.
-Oh.

357
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,733
Every year, we go on a family trip,

358
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,066
and we always try to do
something new and different.

359
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:55,466
This year, I'm super excited
to be going to Costa Rica.

360
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,233
Kylie, T's coming on the trip, right?

361
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,566
[Kylie] Mm-hmm.

362
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:00,400
-That's fun.
-[Kylie] King's coming, too.

363
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:01,766
[Khloe] That's cool.

364
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,233
Super excited
to go to Costa Rica with my family

365
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,333
and just spend some QT time…

366
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,233
-[Kim] And you're planning it all.
-Good choice.

367
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,466
[Khloe whoops]

368
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,933
Planning it all. I'm excited.

369
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,566

370
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,700

371
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,333
[Khloe] He's not coming, right-- Ye?

372
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,000
-[Kim] No.
-[Kylie] I'm gonna go home.

373
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,100
-[Khloe] Okay.
-I have lots of things to do tonight.

374
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,700
[Kim] At least my bags are packed.

375
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:27,466
Bye, guys. I know
I just walked out really abruptly, but…

376
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,633
[Khloe] Bye, Kylie.

377
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,666
I love our trips.

378
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,500
There's so many things
that I want to do,

379
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:32,800
-and I--
-What do you want to do?

380
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:35,000
Adventurous, fun things.
If there's a bunch of monkeys,

381
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,233
I want to be with the monkeys,

382
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,966
and not have Mom like,
"Do they have fleas?"

383
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,866
"I can't be around animals with fleas."
"Rah, rah, rah!"

384
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,366
The point is
to, like, be one with the people,

385
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:46,700
the culture, the <i>animales.</i>

386
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:50,566
Everyone has
their own lives and families now,

387
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,800
and a part of my life is in Cleveland,

388
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,466
so I'm in Cleveland a lot of my time.

389
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,033
And I just feel like this family trip

390
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,033
is needed for all of us,

391
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,700
especially me,
'cause I miss everybody.

392
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:01,300
[Kim] Get over here, boo-boo.

393
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,200
[Saint babbles]

394
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:03,133
What's this stank face

395
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
you've been making lately?

396
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,033
[birds squawking]

397
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:15,400
[birds chirping]

398
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:17,066
{\an8}[Kim] I want, like, a warm hot chocolate

399
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:18,700
with marshmallows is really what I want,

400
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:19,733
because it's freezing,

401
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,666
-and that'll warm my soul.
-You want that hot tea

402
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:22,700
that's, like, the apple

403
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:25,233
-with the honey and all that?
-I'll have anything.

404
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,233
I mean, I feel bad
that I woke you guys all up

405
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,933
so early this morning.

406
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,666
I think I woke up
with, like, 150 text messages.

407
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,966
Can you believe that they found them?

408
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,533
I honestly never thought

409
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,233
that they would catch the robbers.

410
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,100
I just thought so much time has gone on,

411
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,933
and I didn't really realize

412
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,200
how diligent the French police were being

413
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:48,266
and just all the hard work

414
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,633
they were really putting into it.

415
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,566
And to find out
that there were so many people involved,

416
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:56,833
hearing detail after detail,

417
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,966
really just opened up
a whole different perspective for me

418
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,333
of feeling safe.

419
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,100
They got the fingerprints
of two guys inside,

420
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:08,333
and then I think they tapped their phones

421
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,533
and went from there.

422
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,166
How would they get their fingerprints?
They weren't wearing gloves?

423
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:13,200
They were wearing gloves,

424
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:14,833
but he left the duct tape,

425
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,266
and that already had fingerprints

426
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,366
from when they were at home
putting it in the bag.

427
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,633
[Kourtney] Oh.

428
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,900
Do you feel better?

429
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:23,366
Like, do you feel relieved or anything?

430
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,633
It definitely opened up my eyes

431
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,366
to a whole different world

432
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,800
that I can't erase.

433
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,033
I can't go backward.

434
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,000
Like, life is always gonna be different.

435
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,200
Now I just have to be, like, super aware

436
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:36,700
of everything that I do

437
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,033
and who I share it with.

438
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,200
-You know?
-Mm-hmm.

439
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,166
So… I have to go to New York

440
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,366
from Costa Rica, from our family trip

441
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,433
to go meet with, like, the French judge.

442
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,566
-Oh, really?
-Mm-hmm.

443
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,233
So that I don't have to go to Paris.

444
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,933
<i>Knowing that it's a possibility</i>

445
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,266
<i>that people close to me were involved</i>

446
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,666
makes me feel I can't trust anyone,

447
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,266
and that really sucks.

448
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,000
It just opened up my eyes
that this happens,

449
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,900
and that there's, you know,
really bad people

450
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:08,866
in this world.

451
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:10,633
I could still live my life,

452
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,700
but just on edge.

453
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,300

I'm so excited to go to Costa Rica,

461
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:42,466

462
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,066
before his trip to Dubai.

-I go on that one.
-"On dat one"?

465
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,200
[Kourtney] He seemed really excited

466
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:51,600
planning different activities
for the kids,

467
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:54,966

We are about to go to Costa Rica.

We have to have two separate planes

474
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,466
because there's so many of us.

475
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,066
For me, the more, the merrier.

476
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,366
I love the family dynamic
and all of us hanging out.

Everyone loves your curly hair.

-[North] Yeah.
-You didn't know that?

479

Sadly, Kendall and Rob
were not able to make it,

480
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:23,033
because Kendall
has some work commitments,

481
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,333
and Rob just had a baby,

482
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,766
so he is being a new daddy
with his family.

[Kim] He wanted to come.

494
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,700
He almost changed his mind last minute.

495
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:54,833
But I'm going to New York,

496
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,800

staying at home.

when our trip is over,

499
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,433
'cause I have to go in front of the judge

500
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,733
to give my testimony.

501
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
I don't want to overwhelm anyone else

502
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:09,800
with all my robbery stuff.

503
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:11,766
I can handle it, you know, by myself,

504
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,733
and just get it done.

505
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,900
Are you okay?

506
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:17,600
No offense, but I'm not feeling well.

507
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,400
[Kim] I'm kind of stressed.
It's overwhelming.

508
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,800
This is overwhelming for me,

509
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,566
in such a big way.

510
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,400
I'm usually 150% in on a vacation,

511
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,666
but it's been so challenging

512
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,300
going through this whole process

513
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:35,100
with Caitlyn and her book.

517

00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,200

528
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:09,533
[Kim chuckles] Okay. Bye.

529
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,166
[Kanye] <i>Love you.</i>

530
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,300
Love you, too. Bye.

531
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:14,800
Aren't you excited to be here?

532
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:15,866
I am.

533
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:17,000
I feel like it'll be fun.

534
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,533
Is Scott staying in our villa?

535
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,633
I forgot he was even coming.

536
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,633
I know.

537
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
He hasn't spoken to me

538
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:25,866
'cause he knows he [bleep] up in Dubai.

539
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,533
But, like, did he [bleep] up in Dubai?

540
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,500
Like, yeah, he was majorly inappropriate,

541
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:31,566
-but, like, they're not together.
-They're not,

542
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,133
but she leads him on.

543
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,300
Going to, like, Aspen together

544
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:36,700
for New Year's is strange.

545
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:39,266
-Yeah, I told her that.
-I said, "You're giving him false hope.

546
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,200
I understand why he thinks
you guys are together.

547
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:42,466
I think you're together."

548
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,500
You do what you do, who cares?

549
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:45,533
If Scott were to own it,

550
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,166
no one would give a [bleep].

551
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:48,366
It's from the-- literally,

552
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,066
the two different personalities.

553
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,400
Yeah.

554
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:53,166
Why don't you wear your sister necklace?

555
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,100
It's so rude.

556
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,433
You just don't believe in our sisterhood?

557
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,566
You know I do, but I have it at home

558
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,100
-sitting right on my thing.
-Okay.

559
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:05,533
[Latino music playing]

560
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,700
[Penelope] Come on. Let's go.

561
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:15,100
[Kourtney] Hey, Mart, what do you think?

562
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,000
[Reign] Yeah.

563
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,700
[Kourtney] Ooh!

564
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:20,100
-[Host] Welcome to Villa Manzu.
-Yeah, thank you.

565
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,533
Do you guys want a towel?

566
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,566
We're in Costa Rica, girl.

567
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:24,466
[Penelope] Yeah.

568
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:25,433
[Khloe] Ooh.

569
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,566
[Kourtney] Hey, guys.

570
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:28,200
This is so nice. It's amazing.

571
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:31,433
[Scott] Wow, this place is wild, Mase.

572
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,900
[Hostess] Would you like
some fresh coconut water?

573
00:20:46,466 --> 00:20:48,466
-[Kourtney] It's so good.
-[Khloe] Greetings.

574
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:49,600
Is this your new house?

575
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,100
-[Kourtney] Hi.
-It's beautiful.

576
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,100
-[Kourtney] Welcome to my house.
-[King] Mason!

577
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,233
[Kourtney] Aw.

578
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
[Khloe] This is so pretty.

579
00:20:57,366 --> 00:20:58,533
Look at the pool.

580
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,700
That's nice.

581
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,033
[Khloe] The house that I found

582
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,966
for all of us in Costa Rica

583
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:04,700
is absolutely gorgeous.

584
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:07,700
You're submerged in the rain forest.

585
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,600
And because it's our first night,

586
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,600
I have something
a little special for everybody

587
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:16,333
that I'm super excited
to surprise them with.

588
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,366
[fireworks exploding]

589
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,766
Oh, my God.

590
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,300
Look, you guys.

591
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,200
[kids cheering]

592
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:22,300
[Kris] That is so cool.

593
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,000
[North] Wow.

594
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,300
[Kourtney] Oh, Khloe, this is so romantic.

595
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:28,433
[Mason] Real fireworks!

596
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,900
Next to Kylie and Tyga.

597
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:31,566
[Kris] Look at that one.

598
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,533
[Khloe] Oh, how pretty. Look it, you guys.

599
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,933
[Khloe] It seems like every family member
is oohing and aahing,

600
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,966
so pat on my back.

601
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,366
I mean, I pulled this off,

602
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,700
and I should probably plan

603
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:43,800
every family trip.

604
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:48,733
[all cheering]

605
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,066
So you're not gonna stay at the house?

606
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:51,966
[Scott] No.

607
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:53,800
Why? Just stay here.

608
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:55,400
[Scott] I like my own space.

609
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:56,333
I feel you,

610
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,300
but you should have stayed here.
[laughing]

611
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:01,666
In Costa Rica I'll be staying
at a hotel down the street,

612
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:04,100
because I only really get lonely,

613
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,266
and then start to annoy myself more

614
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,666
that the girl I used to be with
is down the hallway

615
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,866
and I'm not sleeping with her.
What has my life come to?

616
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:13,666
So I don't really feel like
there's any reason for me

617
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:14,966
to sleep under the same roof.

618
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,900
Kourt, look at P and North.

619
00:22:16,966 --> 00:22:18,666
[Khloe] You guys are so cute.

620
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,100
Doesn't that make you guys happy

621
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,233
-that they're, like, best friends?
-[Kim] Yeah.

622
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,133
[Kourtney] Can I sit next to you?

623
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,366
This is gluten-free bread.

624
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,800
You can dip it in that oil.

625
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:32,966
[Penelope] Where's my mac and cheese?

626
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:34,666
[Kourtney] You didn't order
mac and cheese.

627
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:36,166
This is what you ordered, babe.

628
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:38,266
[Penelope] No, I don't like my quesadilla.

629
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,900
-Babe, babe.
-[Kourtney] She doesn't like

630
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:40,933
when I call her "babe."

631
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,500
She likes when I call her "honey."

632
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,000
[Kris] It's interesting

633
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:46,433
that your genes are so strong,

634
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,866
because Kourtney's genes
were really strong.

635
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:50,900
She was the most Armenian-looking baby

636
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,933
-that I had.
-Oh. They came out all right.

637
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,433
[Kris] You should have another one

638
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,533
just for the hell of it.

639
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,333
[Khloe] Babe, what are you guys
most excited to do?

640
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,433
[Penelope] Nothing.

641
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,133
-[Kris] I'm with you, P.
-[Scott] Me, too.

642
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,533
I knew Lovey would be with you.

643
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,400
Nothing is so relaxing.

644
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:07,933
-[Khloe] What about whitewater rafting?
-[Kris] Tubing.

645
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,966
[Khloe] Okay, whatever.

646
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:10,766
You're not doing any of this, Mom?

647
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:13,533
Why not?

648
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,233
[Kris] 'Cause that's what
people that are 61 do.

649
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,266
[Khloe] Like, why do you fly

650
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,566
all the way out here to do what?

651
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:21,066
Like, we want to bond with you.

652
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,366
[Kris laughs] All right.

653
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:23,700
I get not wanting to do that

654
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:25,666
and staying here and laying out.

655
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,433
We're going
to the dinosaur park, aren't we?

656
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,166
-[Scott] That was my idea.
-[Kourtney] Yeah, we're going

657
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:33,033
-and we'll take the kids.
-[ringtone playing]

658
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,366
[Khloe] Hi, Kylie.

659
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:39,166
Why would you go up to my room, anyway?

660
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,700
Kylie wants to hijack my room.

661
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,200
You guys are ass[bleep].

662
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:48,766
-[Tyga] Good-bye, room.
-[Kylie] Good-bye.

663
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,333
This is what I'm talking about.

664
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,966
A real couple's sanctuary.

665
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:54,333
Yeah, it's more romantic up here.

666
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,466
This is romantic.

667
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:57,100
Drinks?

668
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,133
There's a fridge?

669
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,100
Oh, my God. They played us.

670
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,866
[Khloe] What the [bleep] is going on?

671
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,633
{\an8}[Kylie] Khloe, we're stealing your room.

672
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,133
Thank you.

673
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,666
Thank you? You didn't ask.
You guys just moved--

674
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:15,600
I don't know
how you brought that back down here,

675
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:16,800
but that's the price you pay.

676
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:18,066
[Tyga laughs]

677
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,300
And by the way, every trip,

678
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:21,966
I've never gotten the big room.

679
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,600
I'm always wherever. So then you guys--

680
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,433
I'm literally at dinner for 15 minutes,

681
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,766
and you guys take my room.

682
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,733
-[Tyga] Mm-hmm.
-You should have been watching.

683
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,633
[Khloe] Note to self,

684
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,433
get my own house when I come here.

685

I haven't even woken up yet.

702
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,033
[Khloe] That's fine.

703
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,533
Yeah.

704
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,500
What's your bracelet?

705
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:29,666
Corey gave me that,
like, two years ago.

706
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:30,766
[Khloe] It's so pretty.

707
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:31,766
[Kris] Oh, thank you.

708
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,166
[Khloe] Mase, where are you going?

709
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:34,200
I'll see you in a little.

710
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,000
[Khloe] Okay. I'll see you in a little.

711
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:39,200
Mom, how long
have you guys been boning for?

712
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:40,866
[mystery music plays]

713
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:42,633
-Khloe.
-Okay, dating.

714
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,333
-Same thing.
-I remember that first night

715
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,533
like it was yesterday.

716
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,533
Ew.

717
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,233
How long have you guys been dating for?

718
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,666
-Two and a half years.
-Wow.

719
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:53,500
[Corey] It'll be three years this summer,
the day we started,

720
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:54,566
getting it.

721
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,133
[Khloe] Okay.

722
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,533
Why are you sitting over there?

723
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,600
That's Kris Jenner.

724
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,033
[Kris] I haven't had much rest in a while.

725
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,333
And on this trip I just want to relax.

726
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,600
So, Khloe's gonna have to accept that

727
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:14,500
at some point,

728
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:15,700
and stop torturing me.

729
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:17,600
I'll be fine. I just need to eat.

730
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,533
This is why these vacations

731
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,000
normally just aren't vacations.

732
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:24,433
[Corey] You have Khloe
screwing a knife to her head.

733
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
-I just--
-[Corey] She want

734
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:28,333
-to spend time with you and bond.
-Because I never see you guys.

735

Jesus Christ.

736
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,800
-So, what, here?
-[Corey] Yeah.

737
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:37,566
Tell me about Cleveland.

738
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,233
[Khloe] It's nice.

739
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,900
But it snows there. There's seasons.

740
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:45,866
I wish Tristan wasn't playing basketball,

741
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:48,300
-because he could be on this vacation.
-[Khloe] Well, I don't.

742
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:51,633
I don't. That's his career.
I don't wish he wasn't playing basketball.

743
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,100
I know, but I mean it'd be nice
if he was on vacation.

744
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,900
When are you gonna bring him
on a family vacation?

745
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:59,300
I mean, we would go
on, like, a private family vacation,

746
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:02,100
but I don't want him to be on camera

747
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,700
-anytime soon.
-[Kris] Yeah.

748
00:27:03,766 --> 00:27:05,566
[Khloe] Our lives are, like, so great

749
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:06,866
and it's so good

750
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:09,100
and, like, I need to keep
some things to myself.

751
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,400
I agree.

752
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:16,000
[upbeat music playing]

753
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,433
What is that?

754
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,433
You would love those crackers
in the other room.

755
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Have you had 'em?

756
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:25,633
[Kourtney] Rice cereal, honey rice.

757
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,366
-Hey, what's up, girls?
-[Khloe] Hello.

758
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,100
-[Kourtney] Hey.
-[Corey] What's going down?

759
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,433
[Kourtney] Sorry.

760
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,933
Y'all should, like, do this sometime,

761
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,333
like, have a slumber party,
then gossip and talk all night.

762
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,300
With Kim in one bed

763
00:27:36,366 --> 00:27:38,066
-and Kourtney and I in another.
-We should.

764
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,866
Yeah, the big girls and the little girls.

765
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:41,166
That would be fun.

766
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,300
[Corey] Well, when it happens,

767
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:45,000
y'all can't have cell phones.

768
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:46,433
Y'all just gonna have each other,

769
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,533
like good old days.

770
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,833
Good old conversation.

771
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,633
Does anyone find Scott weird?

772
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,866
[Khloe] Oh, my God.

773
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:54,400
Playing in the bed, the guy…

774
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,100
[Scott] I'm just trying
to talk to my wife.

775
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,233
She's not your wife.

776
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,400
Oh, I forgot.

777
00:27:58,466 --> 00:27:59,666
Khloe, help me.

778
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:01,200
Oh.

779
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:02,166
[Kourtney] I don't know

780
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:03,866
how many more times I could say,

781
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:05,666
it ain't happening.

782
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,133
Khloe, help me, help me.

783
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,600
[Khloe] I don't know
if this is, like, what you want.

784
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,466
It's typical Scott behavior, I think.

785
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:16,066
But do you think he does that
because you don't say no?

786
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,366
I think I probably do say no.

787
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:20,233
Yeah, you're like, "Stop!

I'm ready to go.

and I'm sorry.

where real dinosaurs were,

808

but they're not.

809

No, there's no real dinosaurs.

[Pilot] Hi.

816
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,800
[Scott] Every time
that we go on a vacation,

817
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:18,900
I try to find something that's special

818
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,666
that we can experience as a family.

819
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:22,433
So I found this dinosaur park
in Costa Rica

820
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,733
that I thought the kids would love.
They're into dinosaurs.

821
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,700
I'm excited.

-[Mason] Yeah.

-and feet inside.
-Is that a dinosaur down there?

this is people's houses.

838

That's how they dry their clothes

after they wash them.

-[Scott] Guys, that's not nice.
-[Kourtney] Don't bother them

861

'cause they'll eat you
and it's not healthy for them.

Those are dinosaurs.

00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,166
[Scott] There's definitely two ways

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,633

all these amazing moments

to have the other side of the relationship

00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:12,233
[North] Can I have a lollipop?

878
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,466
[Kourtney] Yes.

879
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:15,600
Can we get <i>uno de este?</i>

880
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:17,066
Gracias.

881
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,000
[Kourtney] Oh, <i>si.</i>

882
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:22,766
Oh, she wants one with Mase.

883
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:24,600
[Scott] Stop.

884
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:25,833
[Kourtney] Get it, Mase.

885
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,700
Get it, Mase, yeah.

886
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:29,300
I'll take it.

887
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:30,900
[Scott] Oh, my God.

888
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:36,700
[upbeat music playing]

889
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:38,466
[Khloe] Let's go.

890
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:39,433
[grunts]

891
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,900
{\an8}[King] Swimming?

892
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:43,466
[Khloe] Pull it down.

893
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:44,966
[King] Okay.

894
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,366
[Khloe] Ay-ay-ay.

895
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,700
[King giggles]

896
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:54,366
[Khloe] Hey, King, King.

897
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:57,133
[King] Daddy!

898
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,966
[Tyga] What's up, man? You out the pool?

899
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:04,633
[Khloe] I think what I planned for

900
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,100
was all of us to spend

901
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,600
at least, like, day one together.

902
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:11,266
Scott and the kids go into the dino park--

903
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,333
totally get it.

904
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,433
And then, like, Kim just wanting
to lay out, I get that, too.

905
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,900
But being divided,

906
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:19,300
it just isn't what I… planned.

907
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:22,766
[Scott] Whew.

908
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,466
I'm gonna go shower.

909
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:26,566
[Kourtney] Are we eating at your hotel?

910
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:27,500
[Scott] Yeah, at 6:00.

911
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,133
Love you.

912
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:31,500
Mmm, mmm.

913
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:33,000
[Kourtney] Stop.

914
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:34,700
-[Scott] Love you.
-[Mason] I love you.

915
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,266
[upbeat music playing]

916
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:47,300
[Khloe] Wow, what a nice room you have.

917
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,566
What are you wearing?

918
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:51,066
[Kim] Just, like, a dress.

919
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:53,400
What's happened?
I'm not wearing this to dinner.

920
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:54,933
Is that what you're wearing to dinner?

921
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:56,466
Yeah.

922
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:58,333
-It's cute.
-Sorry to disappoint you.

923
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,366
{\an8}[Kim] I have some news to share with you.

924
00:33:00,433 --> 00:33:02,600
Oh, my God, you're pregnant.

925
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,600
[Kim] Oh, you think that every time.

926
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:05,900
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

927
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,133
I just wanted to [bleep] with you.

928
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,133
Um… so you're gonna die.

929
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,966
No, I don't like these kind of things.
What's happening?

930
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,133
No, you're gonna [bleep] die.

931
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,066
[Khloe] What?

932
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:20,500
[Kim] So, Scott flew out a girl.

933
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:22,766
Yeah.

934
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:25,933
Stop.

935
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,933
[Kim] Yeah. So that's why he's staying

936
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,866
at the other hotel.

937
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:29,866
Her name is Chelsea.

938
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,733
On our family trip with the kids?

939
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,133
[Kim] With the kids.

940
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,900
[Khloe] Like, I-I don't believe it.

941
00:33:36,966 --> 00:33:38,100
I'm in shock.

942
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:41,033
Who the [bleep] does something like this?

943
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,733
You were just downstairs

944
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,533
literally trying to make out with Kourt.

945
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,066
How dare you?

946
00:33:47,133 --> 00:33:48,866
Chelsea... hold on.

947
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,433
[Kim] We need to get Kourt up here now.

948
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,366
We can't be doing this behind her back.

949
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:54,400
[Khloe] I don't want to do anything
behind her back.

950
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,866
How did you find this out?

951
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,000
[Kim] Security called Stephanie

952
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:00,533
and was like, "We have such and such

953
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,266
trying to get into Scott's room."

954
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,633
"She just flew in here."

955
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,666
"Is it authorized to get in?"

956
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
-So what do we do?
-The balls this guy has.

957
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,199
[Kim] I know. What do we do?

958
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:11,900
We're going there for dinner tonight.

959
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,033
So, let's go to his room.

960
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,533
I'm gonna go by his room and confront him.

961
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,900
Well, I don't want to do anything

962
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:19,199
because of the kids.

963
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:23,866
[Kourtney] This is cute.

964
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,733
-You look gorge, Kourt.
-Thank you.

965
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:30,566
[Kim] Um…

966
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:32,666
What is happening?

967
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:33,733
[Stephanie chuckles]

968
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,866
[Kim] We have something to tell you.

969
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:36,766
Yeah?

970
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,466
[Khloe] Is your heart racing?

971
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:40,166
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-Don't-don't freak out.

972
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:41,233
[Kourtney] What?

973
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:45,933
{\an8}[Kim] We have something to tell you.

974
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,133
Yeah.

975
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,033
-[Khloe] Is your heart racing?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

976
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,199
[Khloe] Don't freak out.

977
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:51,366
[Kourtney] What?

978
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:54,900
Scott brought a girl out here.

979
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:57,466
For what?

980
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:02,966
Like, what's the point of even…

981
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:04,866
-[Kim] On a family vacation?
-No, no, but what…

982
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:06,700
yeah, like, what's even the desperation?

983
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:08,100
[Kim] I don't… I have no idea.

984
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,400
It's four days. You can't last four days

985
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:11,866
without getting your [bleep] sucked?

986
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:13,266
What a [bleep] loser.

987
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,466
I always had his back.

988
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:15,933
I always thought, like, "Oh,

989
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,066
they're gonna get back together."

990
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:19,000
Move on.

991
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:20,966
[Kourtney] Scott and I are living

992
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:22,333
our own lives,

993
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,433
but, you know, we're here with our kids.

994
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,133
We're here to just be a family,

995
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,066
and I don't understand

996
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:30,000
why he would even think

997
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:31,566
to invite somebody.

998
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:34,600
It's hurtful and disrespectful.

999
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,600
-Loser.
-[Kris] What's going on?

1000
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,066
-I thought we were gonna go to dinner.
-[Khloe] I know. I'm starving.

1001
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:41,033
Do you want to tell?

1002
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
[Kourtney] Scott has a girl
here on the trip.

1003
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,866
-Scott flew a girl out.
-[Kim] Chelsea.

1004
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:45,966
[Kris] No, he didn't.

1005
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:47,766
And is staying in his hotel.

1006
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,033
Are you guys serious?

1007
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:49,933
[Kim] Yeah.

1008
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,166
[Kourtney] What if he's bringing her
to dinner?

1009
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,833
I'm not going if he's bringing her.

1010
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,400
[Khloe] He's not bringing her to dinner.

1011
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:59,100
[Kourtney] Why even…
why even take that risk?

1012
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:01,733
It's almost like he wants me to know.

1013
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,866
[Kim] Totally. I'll just put my clothes on

1014
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:06,100
-while you finish talking.
-[Kris] Why don't we go there,

1015
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,366
and then, when he sits down for dinner,
we'll just go, "How's Chelsea?"

1016
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,066
I just don't care for the confrontation.

1017
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:14,233
-What happened to you?
-If I show up somewhere

1018
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,066
and everyone starts going…

1019
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,800
-You used to be so combative.
-…"Kourtney,

1020
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:19,200
what were you doing?"

1021
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:20,700
I wouldn't want to deal with that.

1022
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:21,900
But this is wild.

1023
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:23,666
-It's disrespectful.
-Should we just tell him

1024
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:24,866
dinner's canceled?

1025
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,166
[Kris] No. Don't cancel dinner.

1026
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:29,400
I'm just saying
cancel him from dinner.

1027
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:31,566
-Let's just get in the car.
-Kourtney, are you okay?

1028
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:34,266
Yeah, I'm just thinking about
all the guys I'm gonna [bleep]

1029
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:35,300
when I get home.

1030
00:36:35,366 --> 00:36:36,533
[laughing]

1031
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:45,166
[Kim] Like, what did he think,
that we weren't gonna find out?

1032
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:46,466
[Khloe] Basically.

1033
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:49,166
I don't think I'm down for, like, drama.

1034
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:51,733
I think we should just have

1035
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,066
a couple bites,

1036
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:55,166
tell him we'll see him tomorrow.

1037
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:57,266
[Khloe] That's… I mean, we don't care

1038
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:58,200
if you do your thing.

1039
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:01,033
-It's just we're on a family trip.
-Well, I wasn't gonna have him come,

1040
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,900
but then I was like,
"Ugh, just have him come,

1041
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:04,533
because we could all hang out

1042
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,466
as a family."

1043
00:37:05,533 --> 00:37:06,933
But if it's gonna be like that,

1044
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,266
then I don't need

1045
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:09,866
to go on a family trip with him again.

1046
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:20,500
[Khloe] <i>Hola.</i> How are you?

1047
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:22,266
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

1048
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,733
Looks delish.

1049
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,066
It's beautiful.

1050
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:27,400
We could sit Scott and his girlfriend.

1051
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:28,966
[Khloe] Scott could sit down there.

1052
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:30,833
[Kourtney] Scott's writing me,

1053
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,733
"You at dinner yet?"

1054
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
[Khloe] Just don't answer.

1055
00:37:32,866 --> 00:37:35,066
-He'll figure it out.
-[Kourtney] Literally, God is good.

1056
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:38,066
God is [bleep] good.

1057
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,466
Like, I really don't think

1058
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:42,066
I could get back together with him.

1059
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:42,966
Yeah.

1060
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:45,900
My kids, like, deserve to have,

1061
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:49,366
somebody with better, like,
moral characteristics.

1062
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,266
Yeah.

1063
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,700
So this is, like, your epiphany?

1064
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:54,500
No, no, I've already had the epiphany.

1065
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:58,733
I'm just saying, this is confirmation.

1066
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,600
Removing that as, like, an option

1067
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,766
is just a positive thing to do.

1068
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,766
[Kim] I just don't get
why he'd even want to show face.

1069
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:08,266
I think it's good he wants to come.

1070
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,366
I want to see what kind of mood he's in.

1071
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,233
Thank God I'm the furthest away,

1072
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,633
'cause I cannot handle this.

1073
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,866
[Kourtney] That's why
I was literally, like, shaking.

1074
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:17,933
[Khloe] Oh, I love it.

1075
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,833
I know you do.

1076
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,066
That's why I said,
"Don't do this to me, Khloe."

1077
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,333
I just don't want Khloe to cause

1078
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,600
a big scene.

1079
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:25,866
That's not why I'm here.

1080
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,300
And I'd rather just deal with it

1081
00:38:27,366 --> 00:38:29,966
in, like, a calm, normal manner,

1082
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:31,500
like, when the trip is done.

1083
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:32,933
I love that he's coming.

1084
00:38:33,566 --> 00:38:35,166
Don't do this to me.

1085
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:38,400
I'm not gonna do anything.

1086
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:39,433
Whew.

1087
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:43,933
-He's walking up.
-[Kris] He's walking up.

1088
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,033
Maybe you want to trade places with me.

1089
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,933
[Khloe] My God.

1090
00:38:48,366 --> 00:38:49,233
[Kris] Hey, Scott.

1091
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,833
[tense music playing]

1092
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,733
[Corey] Ho, ho, ho.

1093
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,133
Good luck. That's good luck.

1094
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,133
That's good luck?

1095
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,466
-The praying mantis?
-Yeah.

1096
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:58,666
[Kris] You might need it.

1097
00:38:59,366 --> 00:39:01,200
-The good luck?
-[Kris] The good luck, yeah.

1098
00:39:02,266 --> 00:39:03,400
Is everybody excited

1099
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,733
about the springs tomorrow?

1100
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:06,833
-[Khloe] I am.
-[Kourtney] I am.

1101
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,300
[dramatic music playing]

1102
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:12,000
[Scott] Sure.

1103
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:13,666
[Khloe] So, you're going tomorrow, Scott?

1104
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:15,400
-[Scott] Yeah.
-[Khloe] Hmm?

1105
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:16,533
[Scott] Yeah.

1106
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,200
-[Khloe] Oh, you are? Good.
-[Scott] Yeah.

1107
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,566
[Scott] Is that all right?

1108
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,833
-Yeah.
-[Kris] So what time

1109
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,633
are you gonna be at our place

1110
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,833
in the morning, Scott?

1111
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,833
What time do you want me to be there?

1112
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,233
Probably 10:00.

1113
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,866
-You got it.
-Hmm.

1114
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:33,533
-[Kim] Thank you.
-[Kourtney] No, I'm finished.

1115
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:36,100
Did you guys hear what Chelsea said?

1116
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,766
[Khloe] Oh, yeah, she's such a bitch.

1117
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,766
[Kim] No, she was so nice.

1118
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:43,000
-[Khloe] She was a bitch.
-[Kim] Oh, Chelsea Handler. No.

1119
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:45,233
No, no, I'm talking about Chelsea Clinton,

1120
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,133
what she said
how she was sticking up for Barron Trump.

1121
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,833
[Khloe] That's nice that Chelsea did that.

1122
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,666
But I thought you meant Chelsea Handler.

1123
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:52,633
[Kim] No.

1124
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,366
[Khloe] Scott, how are you feeling?

1125
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:59,133
-[Kourtney chuckles]
-[Scott] What?

1126
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,866
Was that a weird question to ask?

1127
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm confused.

1128
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,700
-[Kim] Let's cut the bull[bleep].
-Right.

1129
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:07,900
[dramatic horn stabs playing]

1130
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:09,200
[Kris] Uh…

1131
00:40:09,266 --> 00:40:10,600
[Kourtney] Oh, my God.

1132
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,966
[Kris] This is gonna be amazing.

1133
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:20,233
-[Kris] Wow.
-[Kourtney] That looks crazy.

1134
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:25,733
[Scott] It's pretty obvious

1135
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,200
that the girls know something's up.

1136
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:29,833
Nobody really wants to say
what's on their mind.

1137
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,566
And if this dinner isn't awkward enough,

1138
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:34,333
these fire dancers have to come out

1139
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,666
and start doing hula hoops.

1140
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,400
I mean, I already felt, like, under fire.

1141
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,900
[all cheering]

1142
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:47,566
-[Kourtney] Wow.
-[Corey] Good job.

1143
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:49,433
-[Kris] Great job.
-[Khloe] Thank you, guys!

1144
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,566
[Kris] Thank you!

1145
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:51,633
Thank you so much.

1146
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:54,800
What are you doing
the rest of the night, Scott?

1147
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:58,100
[dramatic music playing]

1148
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,166
[Scott] What I have to.

1149
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:00,700
What does that mean?

1150
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,633
A crock of [bleep].

1151
00:41:04,566 --> 00:41:06,233
[Kourtney] There's so much tension.

1152
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,300
{\an8}We're all waiting for Scott

1153
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,333
{\an8}to say something,

1154
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,933
{\an8}and this is just the most awkward dinner.

1155
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,866
You said, "I'm doing what I have to."

1156
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:15,300
[Kris] I think what we're wondering

1157
00:41:15,366 --> 00:41:16,933
is if you have a girl here and why.

1158
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:22,333
[Kim] <i>Coming up next week…</i>

1159
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,866
[all shouting]

1160
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:25,533
-Kourtney!
-[whooping]

1161
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:28,466
[Stephanie] A bit more naked, Kourt.

1162
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:30,200
You are so sensitive.

1163
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:31,900
I'm so over all you people.

1164
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:34,133
-I don't care.
-Shut the [bleep] up.

1165
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,933
Do you know that I'm going to New York
to testify against the robbers?

1166
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,200
They had been following me for two years.

1167
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:41,366
There's a level of respect

1168
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:43,033
and appropriateness.

1169
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,866
If you need
to get your [bleep] wet that badly,

1170
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:47,800
I'm gonna get your [bleep]ing [bleep] wet.
