00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,500
I would never go on vacay.

478
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:04,666
[Khloe] Exactly.

479
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,533
So, I saw something online
and I, like, hit up Scott.

480
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,200
I was like, "Hey, what you doing?"

481
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,633
[Kim] I didn't see.

482
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:15,266
-[Khloe] Of, like, her ass.
-[Kim] That is wild.

483
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:19,000
[Khloe] They're alone. He said
he's having, like, the best time ever.

484
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:22,400
He labeled it, "Views."
I don't know what the (bleep) is going on.

485
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:24,466
Cabo is, like, romantic.

486
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:27,766
This seems like an intimate
vacation, which is great.

487
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,666
I would love for them to have
their family back

488
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,800
and be together,
as long as Scott acts right.

489
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:34,666
I'm totally down with that.
And Scott's been doing great.

490
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:37,500
He's been on a great path lately.
They're literally inseparable.

491
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:40,533
Honestly, I'm saying they're (bleep).

492
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,000
[Kim] It fully seems like
they're back together.

493
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,266
-[Khloe] Totally. Hundred percent.
-[Kim] I wonder what she says to him.

494
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:49,600
[Khloe] I would literally give money
to be a fly on the wall.

495
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,933
Like, "Baby..."
I don't know if she says "baby."

496
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,766
I don't think she's a "baby" kind of girl.

497
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,800
[Kim] I don't, either.
-[Khloe] She'll say "babe"

498
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,900
'cause babe's more like you're
at a distance.

499
00:24:57,966 --> 00:25:01,900
-[Kim] Yeah.
-[Khloe] She won't say, "Baby. Hi, baby."

500
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:02,966
She goes, "Hey, babe."

501
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:06,933
[Khloe] That sums up who Kourtney is--
she's a babe girl, not a baby girl.

502
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,100
-[Khloe] I'm a baby girl.
-[Kim] Yeah, I'm, like, a babe.

503
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,033

[Caitlyn] I know. Gabbana heard my voice
as soon as I came in.

-[Caitlyn] I know.

514
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:48,033
[Khloe] I have a ton of opinions
and feelings about Cait,

515
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:52,033
but before Caitlyn, there was Bruce.

516
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,533
And Bruce was in my life for,
like, 24 years.

517
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,433
So, I'm gonna have the sit-down.

518
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,800
[Caitlyn] We haven't talked in a while.

519
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:01,100
And I'm so happy to be here.

520
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,900
[Khloe] Thank you,
I'm happy to have you here.

521
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:06,766
[Caitlyn] Um, I just really
feel like over the last year and a half,

522
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:09,300
it-- we certainly have grown apart.

523
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:15,300
Day after day, after month after month,
nobody calls,

524
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:19,666
nobody checks in-- just, "Hey,
how are you doing?"

525
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:23,733
You can't help but sit there and thinking,
"Okay, is it because I transitioned?

526
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,133
They don't like me anymore?"

527
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,866
And I want to know what I did wrong,
what I didn't do wrong, what I did right.

528
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
And, uh, move forward.

529
00:26:33,866 --> 00:26:37,766
[Khloe] I don't necessarily
want to say you did anything wrong,

530
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,933
'cause I don't know
if, just 'cause you didn't do

531
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,033
something the way maybe I would
have preferred, that makes it wrong.

532
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,733
We deal with things quickly.

533
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,833
We don't have time to really process
a lot of things,

534
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,466
'cause we're always on to the next.

535
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:52,133
And, for me, at the time,
I just wasn't at a place in my life

536
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,300
where I really could invest
in new relationships.

537
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:58,866
It was very hard for me to experience
a lot of new things

538
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:03,000
so quickly and still feeling like
I have to protect my mom

539
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:05,466
in certain things that were
happening, where I felt like

540
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:07,266
they might not have been
the most positive.

541
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:10,000
But then I was also like,
"This isn't my fight to fight anymore.

542
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:13,466
Like, I have my own (bleep) to deal with,
so why don't you guys figure that out?"

543
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:16,300
But I don't think
Caitlyn is a bad person at all.

544
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:18,300
[Caitlyn] You've been through a lot.
I get that.

545
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:22,533
But that's, you know, 23 years
of my life invested in the family and you.

546
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,633
You know, being there when
you have good days and bad days,

547
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,366
and all the things that you go through
when you're growing up,

548
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:31,400
and sneaking out of the house
and I found you and stuff like that.

549
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:34,066
[Khloe] For me, you're all I remember--
Bruce was.

550
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:36,733
So, not having you in my life,
it's a huge blow.

551
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:40,200
'Cause I'm like, "Okay, my second dad,

552
00:27:40,266 --> 00:27:42,633
this guy that I've grown up with,
that raised me,

553
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,400
was taken away from me,
but no one really let me have that."

554
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:58,300
{\an8}[Khloe] Okay, my second dad,
this guy that I've grown up with,

555
00:27:58,366 --> 00:28:02,900
that raised me, was taken away from me,
but no one really let me have that.

556
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,833
I still need to, like,
how you need to transition,

557
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,033
I need to transition into,
like, accepting.

558
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
'Cause to me,
you are two different people,

559
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:15,233
to me, and I don't know
if that's politically correct to say,

560
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,300
I'm not sure.

561
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:19,166
[Caitlyn] Your feelings are important,
that's how you feel, so... yeah.

562
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:20,766
[Khloe] I appreciate.

563
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,733
I'm getting to re-know you again.

564
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,300
I know you still have the same interests
and you like to race cars and all.

565
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:29,600
But your personality,
you got to admit, is different. To me.

566
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,933
-[Caitlyn] To you. Yeah.
-[Khloe] To me, like, you...

567
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,266
[Khloe] The fact that you go to a club,
like at Kendall's,

568
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,500
I was like, "Bruce would never be here."

569
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:38,100
Bruce was always, "Let's go home."

570
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,700
[Khloe] "I got to be home."

571
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:42,766
But Caitlyn is, like, you said yourself,
likes to go out and be social and...

572
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:43,800
[Caitlyn] Yeah.

573
00:28:43,866 --> 00:28:47,000
[Khloe] You said Caitlyn's different
than Bruce. Not in a bad way.

574
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:49,733
I've never said Caitlyn was bad.
I never said Bruce was bad.

575
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,633
[Caitlyn] True.

576
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,033
[Khloe] So I'm getting accustomed to that,
but it's like-- it has to be authentic.

577
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,833
You can't just, like,
push someone onto somebody.

578
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,700
It, like, has to happen in time.

579
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:01,633
[Caitlyn] Mm-hmm. I just want
you to know, from my perspective,

580
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,600
how important our relationship is.

581
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:06,800
[Khloe] To me, too.
-[Caitlyn] In this case,

582
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:09,066
how can we move forward from here?

583
00:29:09,133 --> 00:29:10,766
[Khloe] What's done is done.

584
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,766
And, like, that's why I don't
want to bring up the (bleep) that, like,

585
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,600
-bothered me.
-[Caitlyn] I don't, either.

586
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,366
[Khloe] If it's as simple as,
"Okay, yeah, I didn't try hard enough."

587
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:22,500
And like, we both didn't try hard enough
to meet each other or hang.

588
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:23,800
Like, it's a two-way street.

589
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:26,633
So, yeah, I'm sure we could both
try harder.

590
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,166
-[Caitlyn] You know I love you.
-[Khloe] And I love you, too,

591
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,600
and I never want you to think
that I don't love you.

592
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,433
[Caitlyn] Yeah. Um, although
it may be tough,

593
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,066
I would like for you to experience
some of my life and what I do now.

594
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:41,266
[Khloe] Good. Like, I'm just about,
like, life and family and love

00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,633
and, like, p-- like, whatever's, like,
makes everyone happy.

[Caitlyn] Yeah.

598
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:50,933
So, do you feel better
about this conversation we've had?

599
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,200

[Khloe laughing] Okay, good.

601
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:01,000
From this meeting that we've had,
I think, you know,

602
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:04,266
we're making the right steps,
and with any friendship, you know,

603
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:09,200
there's ups and downs,
but I really hope that this will turn

604
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:14,533
into a relationship that I really want
to invest energy and time into.

00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,100
so we just made that happen.

785
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,000
As I'm traveling, everyone's
trying to make this decision

786
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:59,166
to cancel the rest of Kanye's tour,

787
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:04,233
and, you know, he would never want
to give, like, a half-assed show.

788
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,133
He definitely wants to give his all,
and he knows that he needs

789
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,166
a little bit of time off in
order to do that.

790
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,333
So it'll be okay.

791
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,200
He just needs to take some time
for himself and just...

792
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:19,633
get back focused,
and I think it's for the better.

793
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:22,100
