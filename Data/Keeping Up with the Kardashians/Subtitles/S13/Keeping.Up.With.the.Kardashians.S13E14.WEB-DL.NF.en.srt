-[Eli] Scoot over a little this way.

00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:22,800
Oh, my gosh! Stop. What is this for?

5
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,800
[Kim] Just to have content for my app.

6
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:31,200
Geez. My app is about chocolate chip
cookie recipes. Gluten-free, dairy-free.

7
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:33,100
Mine's a really thoughtful app.

[Kim] It's not gonna come off the table.
Kanye will literally kill me.

00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,433
-What the [bleep] do we do?
-[Eli] You can sand it.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,733
-[Stephanie] Sand it?
-[woman] No, no...

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,833
-[Kim groans]
-[Stephanie] It looks like water now.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,366
Well, I don't know,
maybe we do the whole table?

16
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:55,733
-Do we put rice on it?
-[Stephanie] It's not an iPhone.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
[Kim] Let's just put salt and rice.

18
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:00,600
-[Eli] Are you making bishi?
-[Kim chuckles] Yeah.

Oh, my goodness! MJ and Bob?

-Hello!
-What's good?

-Hi. You look pretty.
-[Kim] Hi, P.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,433
-Wait, I want to hold her.
-[Khloe] No.

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,633
-I've never held her before.
-You've never held...

28
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,166
-[Kim] What?
-I need to have one more baby.

29
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,400
-No, Kourtney, stop.
-So look, guys.

30
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:45,833
Rob, get in the picture.
MP's in it. One... oh.

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,066
And MJ's here. What am I doing?

32
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,366
This is so cute. Everybody look this way.

33
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:53,833
Rob, look this way. One, two, MJ...

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,266
Dream! [Kris trills]

35
00:01:58,433 --> 00:01:59,633
That is so cute.

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,466
Rob, do you want Dream to go on a walk
to go see the ponies and stuff?

37
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,900
There's three strollers
in the garage, guys.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,600
-So, Khlo, I have a proposition for you.
-Make yourself comfortable.

39
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,766
I was thinking,
since you love these kids so much,

40
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,833
I'll give you my embryo to put
inside of you, you carry the baby,

41
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,600
and then give it to me.

42
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,700
What? So you want me to go ahead,

43
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:28,400
get fat, have your child,

44
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,633
and then give it back to you?

45
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,633
Well, there could be a trade in this.

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,633
How much money you paying me
to be a surrogate?

47
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,166
-You have to pay most people.
-[Kim] I only want one more.

48
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:40,666
I have two embryos. So maybe
I'll give you one as a consolation.

49
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:44,966
-Oh, so that's my payment.
-That would be normal[!]

50
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,500
You know what?

51
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,133
That might work out well,

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,033
because maybe your kid will
become more attached to me,

53
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,366
then I get two at the end of the day.

54
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:57,233
-I have good attorneys.
-I'm your sister.

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,466
You never know.

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
Having another baby
would mean everything to me.

57
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:10,133
But the doctors definitely say
it's too dangerous for me to carry.

58
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,800
So we were talking about surrogacy.

59
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:15,400
Then, last year
was kind of a crazy year for us,

60
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,166
so we put it on hold.

61
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:20,033
And now we're kind
of looking into it again.

62
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,866
I wonder how Tristan would feel.

63
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:27,566
-I forgot about Tristan in this equation.
-I think I should say to my boyfriend:

64
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,100
-"I'm pregnant!"
-[Kim] Yes.

65
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,233
"But it's not yours."

66
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,066
-[Kim] He'll be, like, "What?!"
-"And it's not mine!"

67
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:37,333
People think we're so weird already.
Could you imagine?

68
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:46,533
{\an8}-[Khloe] Rob?
-[Rob] Yo.

69
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,766
-You remember Jamel?
-Yeah. How you doing?

70
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,300
-Good to see you again.
-Nice to see you. What's this?

71
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:55,300
Our massive vision board.
What we did was, let's take your thoughts,

72
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:58,866
and instead of them being scattered
in your mind, let's see them visually.

73
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,466
-So you can see and connect the dots.
-[Khloe] That makes sense.

74
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,733
Birthday planning!

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,366
What I'm pushing him is,
in your 30th birthday, like,

76
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:09,000
let's let everything
that happened in your 20s go,

77
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:11,166
and let's just create
the Rob that everybody sees

78
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,000
and knows has dope potential.

79
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,000
-Let's bring that out.
-I could be pretty dope.

80
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:17,066
-Yeah, okay.
-[Rob chuckles]

81
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:23,133
I am really excited Rob wants
to celebrate his birthday this year.

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,033
And it's dirty 30.

83
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,966
-That's cute.
-[Khloe laughs]

84
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,200
[Kim] Vegas, baby. The dirty 30.

85
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,066
I was in Vegas, too.

86
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,466
We were in New York.
We flew from New York to Vegas.

87
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,833
What's up, Las Vegas?!

88
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,833
-[Khloe] Happy!
-[crowd] Birthday!

89
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,366

-[crowd] Birthday!

[laughter, squealing]

91
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,733
-We were wrestling in the hallway.
-On the floor.

92
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,433
-[Khloe] Those drunken pictures...
-That are blurry.

93
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,133
-Yeah.
-Those were good ones.

94
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:55,100
I kind of was thinking
of doing a low-key movie.

95
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,166
-Nothing crazy.
-[Khloe] You could do whatever you want.

96
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:01,700
Jesus turned water
into wine on his 30th.

97
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:04,033
Rob, Mom does that with us every day.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,333
This is your year to turn water into wine.

99
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,400
[upbeat rhythmic instrumental music plays]

100
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,200
-[Khloe] So strange I haven't eaten.
-[Kim] Why?

101
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:23,666
Working. Since last Friday,
I've lost five and a half pounds.

102
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,500
[Kim] That's amazing.

103
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:29,400
I think this, like,
whole surrogate process

104
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:33,000
is so much harder
than anyone would even imagine.

105
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,700
What do you have to do?

106
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:39,866
[Kim] Find someone that you trust
and that, like, is... close by.

107
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,200
But there's so many rules:

108
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:44,033
Don't talk about this.
You're not allowed to talk about this.

109
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,066
You should text them once a week.

110
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,233
-You should, you know...
-Crazy.

111
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,333
I mentioned to Kanye that, um...
that you would be our surrogate.

112
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:57,666
-Wait...
-He was like, "What? Is this a joke?"

113
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:01,933
I was like, "What if it's not a joke?
What if it's, like, serious?"

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,466
Would you do it?

115
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,600
Uh, I... for sure, I thought
it was a joke the whole time.

116
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:14,800
I mean, it's definitely something

117
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:18,533
I would have to, like,
you know, like, simmer with.

118
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:25,033
Carrying a child
and not have it be mine is, like...

119
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:28,233
That's a huge decision.

120
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,833
But Kim desperately
does want another child,

121
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,800
and I know how hard it is
to trust someone carrying your baby.

122
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:38,066
That's probably really terrifying.

123
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,866
I would never want you
to do anything you didn't want to do.

124
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,733
So it's totally up to you. No pressure.

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,033
But I would just, like,
meet with the doctor just to see.

126
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,933
I don't know. Is it selfish of me
to just sit here and just, like, nod

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and listen to her and not be
proactive about anything?

128
00:06:56,066 --> 00:07:01,000
Or should I, you know, entertain this
and just see, like, where this goes?

129
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:18,633
{\an8}-[phone rings]

<i>a party in the bedroom.</i>

-[Tristan]<i> How's everyone's day going?</i>
-[Khloe] Hold on.

137
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,633
-[Khloe chuckles] Oh, yeah.
-Wait, what?!

138
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,700
-[Khloe] You can tell him.
-Do I look gorgeous?

139
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:43,200
-I'm just kidding.
-[Tristan] <i>FaceTime is the weirdest.</i>

140
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:46,833
<i>Especially if you can see the bottom</i>
<i>of my chin, my strong features I have.</i>

141
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,400
[Kim] Yeah. The strong features.

142
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:52,466
So, speaking
of strong features... [laughing]

143
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,633
...how would you feel...

144
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,233
[Khloe] You can't act like that.

145
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,266
You don't want to have kids
anytime soon, do you?

146
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,766
[Tristan]<i> I wouldn't mind four to five.</i>

147
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,566
-[Khloe laughs]
-[Tristan] <i>Don't be nervous!</i>

148
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:12,200
But, like, not, like, in the next
year and a half, right?

149
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,466
[Tristan] <i>Whatever God</i>
<i>has planned, you know?</i>

150
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:19,300
I just think it's a beautiful thing,
and I would want more.

151
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,666
[Tristan] <i>You might as well.</i>
<i>Have you found someone?</i>

152
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:26,300
[Kim] I mean, it's in the process.

153
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,833
[Tristan] <i>Well, is it going</i>
<i>smooth and everything?</i>

154
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,566
[Kim] I hope so.

155
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:34,100
[Khloe voiceover] <i>I could not</i>
<i>believe Kim is talking to Tristan</i>

156

-[Tristan] <i>Well, congratulations.</i>
-[Khloe laughs]

159
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:47,266
I just wasn't sure if you wouldn't mind
if I borrowed Khloe's womb

160
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,366
for, like, like a good year.

161
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:56,033
I was just gonna see
how you felt about that in all honesty.

162
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,700
-[Tristan] <i>Mmm.</i>
-[Kim] Would you?

163
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:00,866
[Tristan]<i> It's up to KoKo.</i>
<i>Whatever she wants to do.</i>

164
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,333
[Khloe] He's so cute.

165
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,666
[Kim] There's so many steps to go through.

166
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:08,500
You have to go through
a full psychological evaluation,

167
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:14,266
I just wasn't sure if Khloe would
even pass those psychological tests.

168
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:18,000
-[laughter]
-[Tristan] <i>She is kind of cuckoo.</i>

169
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,400
[dance music plays]

170
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,933
{\an8}[Jamie] You, over there.
You're gonna be here.

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,100
{\an8}You, here.
We'll start with the laser hair.

172
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,200
{\an8}And then this was your spot.

173
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:36,800
-[Khloe] Kim, you're doing laser hair.
-[Kourtney] This is such a fun sister day.

174
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:39,733
-[Khloe] Sister bonding.
-[Kourtney] What are you getting done?

175
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,366
I'm tightening my legs right now.

176
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:46,333
-I need neck tightening. I'm obsessed.
-[Kourtney] I'm doing that now.

177
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,833
And you do feel it.

178
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,766
-[Khloe] Who cares?
-I can take it.

179
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,466
[Khloe] Normally, you do one treatment
at a time. I don't have time for that.

180
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,100
[Kim] I know. This is genius.

181
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,466
You know what else?
'Cause I love to multitask.

182
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,066
[laughter]

183
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:04,633
Virginia's husband
opened this, like, restaurant.

184
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,600
It's Korean barbecue
and they have pinball at the restaurant.

185
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,800
[Khloe] How is that multitasking?

186
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:14,966
Because there's
a pinball tournament in the restaurant.

187
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:18,566
-I don't know how to play...
-[Kourtney] Neither do I, so we'll learn.

188
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,333
Nope.

189
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,700
-Pinball's, like, not my thing.
-It's really not mine, either.

190
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:28,433
-But I have a soft spot for Kourtney.
-Yeah. I think you should go to support.

191
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,133
But I have other things to do.

192
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,933
-Just any day you have other things to do.
-I'll find something to do.

193
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,666
[Khloe] Tattoo removal, kids.

194
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:41,800
Luckily, I didn't get any tattoos,
so I don't have that problem.

195
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:44,033
[Khloe] This one kills,
'cause it's my lower back.

196
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,466
[Kim] It hurts worse than
getting the tattoo, right?

197
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,233
-[Khloe] Uh, yeah.
-[Jamie] Are you ready?

198
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,933
[Khloe] I don't know. [she laughs]

199
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,533
[Jamie] You're doing so good.
Hang in there, hang in there.

200
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,866
[Khloe] Oh, man.

201
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:59,233
-Oh, [bleep] gonna [bleep].
-[laughter]

202
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:04,533
[Khloe groans and wails]

203
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,366
[Khloe] Arghh!

204
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,566
[Khloe]
[bleep] I forgot to call Cici back.

205
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:18,333
[dialing tone]

206
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,933
{\an8}-[Cici]<i> Hello.</i>
-Hi. Is this Cici?

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,466
-[Cici] <i>Yeah.</i>
-Hi, Chanch.

208
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,600
-[Cici] <i>Hi.</i>
-How are you?

209
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:28,133
[Cici] <i>Oh, I'm doing good.</i>
<i>How's everything?</i>

210
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,100
<i>You look amazing. You must be so in love.</i>

211
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,466
-Thank you. I am.
-[Cici] <i>So what are you doing?</i>

212
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,566
Nothing. I went to Jamaica with Tristan,

213
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:39,966
'cause he had a little break
between the seasons.

214
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,666
-He's Jamaican. That was nice.
-[Cici] <i>I saw pictures. We read his Wiki.</i>

215
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,666
You read his Wikipedia? [laughs]

216
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,200
[Cici] <i>Of course! Are you kidding?</i>

217
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:50,533
<i>Every time somebody dates somebody,</i>
<i>you have to read their Wiki,</i>

218
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,200
<i>you have to learn about them.</i>

219
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:54,233
<i>So now you have to learn Jamaican food?</i>

220
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,633
Yeah. His mom actually
taught me some stuff.

221
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,900
-[Cici]<i> Oh, my God.</i>
-Crazy, right?

222
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:05,200
-Well, we love you, Donna.
-[Cici] <i>Take care. Talk to you next week.</i>

223
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,066
-[Khloe] Okay.
-[Cici] <i>Okay, love you guys.</i>

224
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,566
-Love you, too. Bye.
-Love you.

225
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:09,666
[Cici] <i>Bye.</i>

226
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:12,166
[Khloe] I mean, she's so cute.

227
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,766
We're taking the 405 to Wilshire.

228
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,733
[Khloe] This is your regular doctor
we're going to?

229
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,633
Um, this is Andy Huang.
He helped me out with Saint.

230
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,733
[Khloe] Mm-hm.

231
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,066
Even the fact that you're
spending your time to check it all out,

232
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:29,333
and entertain it, just means
a lot to me, so thank you.

233
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,000
Keeks, of course.

234
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:36,633
I've been thinking a lot about
Kim's request to be her surrogate.

235
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,200
And I don't know if I'm there right now.
I'm in a committed relationship.

236
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:46,766
And I see a future with my boyfriend,
like, I don't know.

237
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,533
I'm not ready to decide just yet,
but I don't think there's any harm

238
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,433
in me meeting with her fertility doctor,

239
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,600
and seeing what does it take
to do something like this?

240
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:01,466
Since the paparazzi's here,
if they catch a picture or a video,

241
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,133
they're definitely
gonna say one of us is pregnant.

242
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,366
Okay. It's a fun little game.

243
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,366
-[Huang] Hi.
-[Kim] Hi. Good to see you.

244
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,233
{\an8}Good to see you, too.
Khloe, nice to meet you.

245
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,100
{\an8}-Nice to see you.
-I'm Dr. Huang. Please, after you.

246
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,200
-[Kim] Here?
-[Huang] Yep. Right there.

247
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,900
[Kim gasps] Are the pink ones gone?

248
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:26,733
-Everybody eats the pink ones.
-[Kim] Mm.

249
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,833
-[Huang] Welcome back.
-[Kim] Thank you.

250
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,666
-Um, you have one awesome sister.
-Yeah.

251
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:33,066
-How old are you?
-32.

252
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,533
You're 32, okay.
Have you ever been pregnant before?

253
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,066
-No.
-Have you ever tried?

254
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,600
-Yes.
-Okay, all right.

255
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:43,433
But I fake tried. Like, I was married,
but I knew the circumstances

256
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,233
weren't the healthiest, so I just
kept pretending I was doing it.

257
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:53,800
When I was doing my fertility treatments,
like, they were more so for Lamar.

258
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,833
I had to stop,
'cause there was much deeper stuff

259
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,533
that was happening in our marriage.

260
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:06,933
I knew, you know, that it wasn't
the right situation to bring a child into.

261
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,966
And I think I've done a lot
of covering up for him.

262
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:12,633
Even when it made me
look like I was the problem.

263
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,400
But I was fine taking on
that burden on my shoulders,

264
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:18,633
because he had a lot
of other deeper [bleep] to deal with.

265
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,000
So the reality is you haven't had
a chance to get pregnant.

266
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:25,366
What I want to do right now
is do a quick ultrasound, okay?

267
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:28,366
-You want to come in to look at my uterus?
-[Kim] Sure.

268
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:32,133
I come here just, like,
for a doctor's appointment.

269
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,333
I have no idea I'm about to,
you know, even get an ultrasound.

270
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Like, this whole thing
is just kind of snowballing

271
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:41,433
and it's moving really fast for me.

272
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,100
-[Huang] Khloe, all set?
-[Khloe] All set.

273
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,166
-[Huang] All righty, okay.
-[Kim] I remember this room.

274
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:49,433
Scoot down so your bottom's
near the edge. Knees bent. Perfect.

275
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,800
-I've cried many times in that chair.
-Scoot down a little a bit more.

276
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:54,800
-You'll see everything I see.
-[Khloe] Perfect.

277
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:56,966
We're looking to see if there's anything

278
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:59,533
that'll get in the way
of a healthy pregnancy.

279
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,666
So you're gonna feel a light touch.
And then a little bit of pressure.

280
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:03,800
-You okay?
-[Khloe] Mm-hm.

281
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:06,366
-That's it.
-What if he were to say I'm pregnant?

282
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,166
-I know. I was thinking that.
-I'm kidding.

283
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:12,033
-He's gonna say, "Oh, my God."
-[Huang] Okay. Here's your uterus.

284
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,033
So this is where we look
forward to seeing a pregnancy.

285
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,633
-And there's nothing there today.
-Okay, phew.

286
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
[Huang] So lining measures five.

287
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:21,733
Let me swing over to your other side.

288
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,866
These are follicles. These hold eggs.

289
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:26,400
This is just giving me an idea
of how young your ovaries are.

290
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,033
Are they young or old?

291
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,800
There are fewer follicles
than I anticipate for normal 32-year-olds.

292
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,400
[Khloe] Shut the [bleep] up.

293
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,933
This is definitely not at all how
I thought this appointment was gonna go.

294
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
What if I can't get pregnant?

295
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,866
{\an8}You're 32 and your ovaries
are acting a little bit older.

296
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,433
You have about five follicles.

297
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,166
32-year-olds, we usually
like to see ten or more.

298
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,900
-I have five?
-You have five.

299
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:03,533
I know we're here to talk
about helping grow their family,

300
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,700
but seeing this, you may consider
getting these in the freezer

301
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,733
while they're young.

302
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,200
-Get dressed. Meet you back in the office.
-Okay.

303
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,766
This is you, Khloe, when you were 20.

304
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:23,100
It's pretty easy to get pregnant,
'cause look at all your eggs you have.

305
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,600
32-year-olds should be
something like this. See this?

306
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,700
-I should have seen 15.
-Right.

307
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:29,066
I get worried when I see five,

308
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:32,733
because if you're not ready to get
pregnant, this five will be four, three,

309
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,566
and two, sooner rather than later.

310
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
I can only imagine
how scary this is for Khloe.

311
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,233
I know she wants to start
a family eventually.

312
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,633
So me and my surrogacy issue,

313
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,866
it just doesn't even matter right now.

314
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,700
She needs to take care of herself.

315
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,400
There's a possibility you being
on the pill as long as you have,

316
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:58,666
has kind of suppressed your ovaries,
and not let me see the other follicles.

317
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:02,100
So, before we jump the gun
or do anything, get off the pills.

318
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,633
I want to do another ultrasound,
I want to count more follicles.

319
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,599
And if we do that, and, uh,
things look great, awesome.

320
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:11,866
If things don't look good, consider
getting some of these in the freezer.

321
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,433
What if I never came here?

322
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,933
There's a reason for everything.

323
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,099
When I went with you to Dr. Surrey,
and he's like, "Khloe, you're fine.

324
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,300
But Kim, you've got problems."
That's when I came in here.

325
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:28,300
-Can I get your card?
-[Huang] I'll grab it for you.

326
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,900
[Kourtney] Should I sit next to Maliks?

327
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:42,666
{\an8}-Are you guys hungry? I'm starving.
-[Khloe] Yeah, we're starving.

328
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,866
{\an8}-Hi.
-[Khadijah] You look cute.

329
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:47,733
-Thank you.
-I see you in your blue.

330
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,033
So yesterday I went with Kim to see
if I could possibly be her surrogate.

331
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,500
I just wanted... we wanted
o get information and do all the stuff.

332
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:58,166
He said
I'm not producing enough follicles,

333
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:01,566
so he asked
if I'd stop taking birth control.

334
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:03,133
-Aah!
-Not to get pregnant.

335
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,933
-Just see what happens.
-Who knows, you might, anyway.

336
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,233
I was never supposed to be checked,
get my uterus checked.

337
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,633
-Those are some serious nails.
-You always go somewhere else.

338
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,166
-When we're talking about something.
-That's where my mind goes.

339
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:19,533
So Kourt got a new car, little sportster.

340
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,266
A little Aston Martin.

341
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,600
Who are... No, really,
seriously, who are you?

342
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,033
-It's really cute.
-Something's happening.

343
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,733
You want to talk about it? 'Cause I do.

344
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,833
No, but I do feel a life change coming on.

345
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,166
Before Scott and I broke up,
I was kind of, like, down and weird.

346
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,166
I started praying in the mornings.

347
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,933
Almost to make me feel,
like, fulfilled or something.

348
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,133
And I was like, "Wait, I don't want that."

349
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,166
I was like, "I don't want to feel
fulfilled in how my life is this second.

350
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,366
Like, I want more."

351
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:55,966
I think after everything
that happened in Costa Rica,

352
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:59,266
to me, it instantly was,
like, God showing me

353
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,033
Scott and I are
just not meant to be together.

354
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,700
I'm ready to just move on
and just feel like, "Okay, it's done."

355
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:11,933
[Khloe] When do you think
you're gonna start dating again?

356
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,033
Or do you want
to be casual and hang out?

357
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,500
If I liked somebody

358
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:19,533
then, obviously I would want
to have them in my life more.

359
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:23,200
-It hasn't gotten to that point.
-You have to start somewhere.

360
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:24,866
You didn't like that cowboy.

361
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,166
-No, no.
-[Khloe] The cowboy?

362
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,500
-You know what...
-He was kind of handsome, too.

363
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:30,866
-No, he was cute.
-He was bold. In front of everybody.

364
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:32,633
-By himself.
-Yeah.

365
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,866
He comes over and goes, "Hi, I just
wanted to say it's nice to meet you."

366
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:38,400
I'm like, "Yeah, okay, bye."

367
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:41,433
Kourtney has no game. She
doesn't know how to do any of this.

368
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,633
She let him walk away. I was like,
"Kourt, you want me to talk to him?"

369
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,400
No, no, if I liked him,
we would've figured it out.

370
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:49,366
-But...
-[laughter]

371
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,766
{\an8}-[Kim] Oh, hey, guys.
-[Khloe] Hey.

372
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,900
-You look pretty.
-[Kim] Oh, thank you.

373
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:05,733
-Where you going?
-This dress doesn't really fit me.

374
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,066
-I just wanted to wear it at home.
-[Kourtney] What is that?

375
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,833
[Khloe] I don't know
what half this food is.

376
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,833
It's a lot of Kourtney Kardashian food.

377
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,733
Who do you guys think is
the number-one chef we've ever had?

378
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,700
Remember when we were little,
that chef when we lived on Abbington.

379
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:23,133
He taught me to say
"Whatever," and "You are a loser."

380
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,733
-And he had long nails.
-[Kris] What?

381
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,200
-Yes.
-Who knew I could afford a chef then?

382
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,266
-You don't remember this, Mom?
-No.

383
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,533
Maybe it was a paperboy
and you let him cook dinner.

384
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
[Kris laughs]

385
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,466
Even though we're not together,
Scott and I are doing our best

386
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:43,966
to be friends and be good parents,

387
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:48,466
so it doesn't really bother me,
hanging out as a family with the kids.

388
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:55,066
Okay, so, guys, we have
to plan Rob's birthday party.

389
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:56,500
His 30th birthday.

390
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,800
-[Kourtney] Okay.
-And it's Disneyland.

391
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:03,066
-I don't do Disneyland.
-Disneyland is the best place on Earth.

392
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:06,733
-Happiest place on Earth.
-Literally, happiest place on Earth.

393
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,300
[Khloe mouths]

394
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:12,966
-Rob wouldn't like that, in my opinion.
-I think if we take over the planning...

395
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,766
then Rob just has to show up and have fun

396
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,166
and he won't get anxious
about all of the planning.

397
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,066
Oh, my lord.

398
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,066
-Bob!
-[Rob] Hey.

399
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:23,233
Hey, Mase.

400
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,200
We're talking about your birthday party.

401
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:28,300
So, Rob, you came in
at the perfect moment.

402
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:32,166
{\an8}We're discussing your birthday party,
so, we got Disneyland.

403
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:37,233
We can do 2 o'clock, snickety-snack,
by 3 o'clock we're on rides, and then...

404
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,200
This is something you want to do, Rob,

405
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:42,900
or is this something that your mother
and Kourtney have talked you into?

406
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:47,633
I know Kourtney loves Disneyland,
but... And Mom, I don't... it doesn't...

407
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,266
-[Kris] Is that good? Rob? Okay.
-Yes.

408
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:55,533
Bob, did you see I wore
a Mickey shirt the other day?

409
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,133
I am gonna Mickey it out,
Rob, just for you.

410
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,133
We're going to church later,
if anyone wants to come.

411
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,366
I don't want to go to church drunk.

412
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:18,833
-I can't do it.
-[Kourtney] I don't think it's that bad.

413
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,766
-To each his own.
-[friend] Turn water into wine.

414
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:25,000
Who's one of them
is their husband's place?

415
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:28,133
-"Who's one of them?" Which one of them?
-[laughter]

416
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,833
-[Khloe] Yes, that's...
-[they laugh]

417
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,033
Virginia. And the restaurant
is a Korean barbeque.

418
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,166
So and then are we playing pinball?

419
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,933
Yeah, it's a full tournament.

420
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,933
Since you're, like, dragging us
and making us do this,

421
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,266
I feel like you need to,
like, literally tickle my pickle

422
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,066
at some point during this night.

423
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:48,066
-A little... [clicks tongue]
-That's not suggestive[!]

424
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:52,433
Not literally tickle it. Like, you need
to go and, like, talk to someone.

425
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
-Talk to who?
-[friend] Pull some digits.

426
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:58,200
Look at you.
You can't handle this conversation.

427
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:01,933
-Don't look at a guy like that.
-I need you to do that. I wanna make you.

428
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,800
I'm just like...
I'm not a setup kind of girl.

429
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:09,833
[Khloe snickers] You're not a...
You don't even talk to the opposite sex.

430
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,300
-'Cause you're so socially awkward.
-No, I do.

431
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:14,500
-No, you don't.
-Yeah.

432
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:17,600
This is why Kourtney
likes to hang out with the young...

433
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,900
-No, they come for me.
-No.

434
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,000
We get that, girl,
but let me tell you why.

435
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,133
[friend] "They seek me."

436
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,700
Because you don't care,
so you just, like, you're dope-ass Kourt.

437
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:31,666
Then when you like someone,
you're so [bleep] weird.

438
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,700
-I don't know how that happens...
-[fly buzzes]

439
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:36,333
-Ugh! Ugh!
-Did you get it?

440
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,100
-Come on, Daniel-san.
-[friend] Get it!

441
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,766
-[Khadijah squeals]
-[friend] It's here.

442
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,933
[Malika] It's there, in front of you.

443
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,566
-[slams]
-[all] Yeah!

444
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,000
[bouncy dance music plays]

445
00:23:48,033 --> 00:23:49,466
[Khloe] There's paparazzi.

446
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,366
Should we take
these hats off for walking in?

447
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:54,300
-[friend] Oh, no, girl, keep that on.
-[Khloe] Come on, girls.

448
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,000
Pinball Pussies.

449
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:58,900
-[woman] Whoo-hoo!
-[Kourtney] Here we come.

450
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:01,866
-[announcer] Welcome, guys.
-[Khloe] Thank you.

451
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:05,100
Welcome to the Pin-Ballbusters Tournament.

452
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,200
[cheering]

453
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:08,566
We are not leaving without the trophy!

454
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:12,466
-[Khloe] This is really exciting, guys!
-[all] Pinball Pussies!

455
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:15,133
-[all cheering]
-[friend] Chug, chug, chug!

456
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,866
[Khloe] There you go!

457
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:19,033
[whistle blows]

458
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,733
[announcer] Attention, everyone, we're
gonna get this tournament started, okay?

459
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,466
It's gonna be two guys, two girls.

460
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:28,333
-[Khloe] Go, Kourtney! Whoo!
-[Malika] You're going down!

461
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,800
[whistle blows]

462
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:31,700
[friend] Go, Kourt! Whoo!

463
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,466
[pinball machine beeps]

464
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:34,800
Yeah, Khlo!

465
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:36,700
-[Khloe] Yeah.
-[Malika] How did it not go in?

466
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,766
[Kourtney squeals]

467
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:41,500
I have no clue what the rules are,
I have no clue how to win, lose,

468
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:43,300
Who cares what the rules are?

469
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,233
I'm really here for the free alcohol.

470
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:51,866
Make sure this mark's not on my head...

471
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,233
[all scream]

472
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,366
-[Malika] I am so sorry!
-[woman] Towel, please!

473
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:58,333
[Malika] I'm gonna get kicked out.

474
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,700
Whore!

00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:03,833
[Malika] Hey, you just scored 715,000.
That was [bleep].

476
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,000
-Can I steal her? Sorry.
-[Khloe] Yeah.

477
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:09,433
Come on, come on, mingle.
Don't hang out with people you know.

478
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,733
-Hi, guys!
-[men] Hi.

479
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,300
-[Malika] I'm Malika.
-[Niko] Niko.

480
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:15,500
-[Malika] Nice to meet you.
-Hi, how are you? I'm Kourtney.

481
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,066
-Are you guys pinballers?
-[Khloe] Go, Kourtney! Woo!

482
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,866
You're doing so well.

483
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:27,666
-Are you guys pinballers?
-[Khloe] Go, Kourtney! Woo!

484
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:29,666
-[Niko] Obviously.
-[Khloe] You're doing well.

485
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:35,333
Yeah. This is our scorecard.
I don't know how we're doing.

486
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,033
-Who do you think's better, you or Khloe?
-Probably Khloe.

487
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,066
-Khlo!
-[Niko] I want to see who's better.

488
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,833
Okay, yeah. She's better.

489
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,033
She said you're better, so I don't know.

490
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,266
I think she's flirting with you.
Is that your way of flirting?

491
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,966
-Yes, it is.
-Talking you up, that's the best way.

492
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:55,233
-[Kourtney] Khloe is the best.
-[Khloe] Yeah.

493
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,600
You're so socially awkward.

494
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:06,233
Like, it takes a lot for me to even
find anyone remotely attractive.

495
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,966
But you wouldn't
give someone, an eye or, like...?

496
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:12,366
[laughs] No. If that's your move,
that's a big problem.

497
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:14,633
-But what's the eye?
-[Khloe clicks tongue]

498
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,733
What's the eye?

499
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,366
[Malika] Kourtney, did you meet Matthew?

500
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:22,200
-M and M.
-Blondes and brunettes go well together.

501
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:25,766
It's not where I was
coming to look for my next husband.

502
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,266
Didn't think so.

503
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,233
[whistle blows]

504
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,166

[whooping, cheering]

506
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,433
Seriously, this was an amazing win,
but all of you did so much better.

507
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,900
So, Kourtney,
I'd like to give you the trophy.

508
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:45,933
[crowd cheers]

509
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,433

{\an8}-[Jamel] Arthur George.
-[Rob sighs]

513
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,300
Why is all your mom's chairs so soft?

514
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:05,100
This is the same table Khloe has,
but these chairs are better.

515
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,933
<i>Way</i> better. You can... be elevated.

516
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,233
-[Kourtney] Hello, Bob.
-Hey, Kourt.

517
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,966
-Hey, Bob. Hi. How are you?
-How are you?

518
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:14,600
-Good to see you again.
-[Kourtney] Going to church tonight.

519
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,500
-Do you want to come?
-[Rob clicks tongue]

520
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,066
-[Jamel laughs]
-[Rob] Mm-mm.

521
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:21,333
I'm learning what your smiles
mean and don't mean.

522
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,533
-I feel like you don't want to go.
-No, I do.

523
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,933
-It's up to you. No pressure.
-[Rob] I do want to go.

524
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,166
-I do want to go.
-Okay.

525
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:30,566
-[Rob] Just not right now.
-Okay.

526
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:34,200
So, anyways, what's going on with Disney?

527
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:38,000
-We didn't touch base.
-He was down, I was down.

528
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:40,500
-But I really wasn't down.
-I'm always down.

529
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:42,233
What are you gonna do for your birthday?

530
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:46,200
I'm just gonna disappear
and, like, not really do anything.

531
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,066
So you don't want
to have anything even low-key?

532
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:53,566
All these things require a lot.

533
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:56,600
-And I'm just not ready for that.
-And you're just not there.

534
00:27:56,666 --> 00:28:00,466
Rob has been doing so well lately
and it's just disappointing,

535
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:03,066
I think, to see him,
you know, retreat back.

536
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:06,866
We all, I think,
just became super excited,

537
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:11,066
and maybe just took it too far,
and, like, maybe it stressed him out.

538
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:15,233
But nobody wants him to celebrate
his birthday just staying home alone.

539
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:18,766
Do you want to just do,
like, a low-key dinner?

540
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,466
Possibly, but...

541
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,933
I don't know.

542
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,133
Things aren't low-key with our family,
but I think we should do something.

543
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,300
It's your 30th birthday.

544
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:33,166
I don't know. Things may change.

545
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,933
My decision may change,
but I just doubt it.

546
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:46,300
So, how the hell are you guys?

547
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:50,133
-Good.
-[Khloe] Good, good.

548

-My mailbox.

-You guys are freaking me out.

the Internet I don't want to be out there?

go to a farm and want to move to a farm...

-Yeah?

-Hell to the no.
-No, we already did it.

565
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:39,400
We already did it,
and you got so many messages.

566

You guys are the biggest losers ever.
You think I like farmers only?

567

want to move to a farm.

Yeah, with a hot [bleep] guy.

569

know there's not hot guys there?

-[Kim] Mm-hmm.
-[sing-songy] I don't think he's a farmer.

-Ew! You guys.
-You can tell.

do you know lives in North Hollywood?

574
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:05,100
I told you about my night last night
and you think I need some help?

-Do you want me to repeat it to Kim?
-What? I kind of want to know.

00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,433
This is all I wanted
for my birthday, right here.

634
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:09,100
{\an8}-[Huang] How are you?
-Good. You?

635
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:11,000
{\an8}-Good. Great to see you.
-Thanks for seeing me.

636
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:13,366
No problem. My pleasure. Okay.

637
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,633
You're not on birth control,
so I'll count your follicles.

638
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,433
and get a good idea of
your true ovarian reserve.

639
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,266
You're young. The hope
is your ovaries are equally young.

640
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,833
-Okay.
-If they are, great.

641
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,366
If they're not, maybe
we want to do something about it.

642
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:29,233
-Right.
-Ideally, I want to see 10, 12 follicles.

643
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,733
-That means your ovaries are still young.
-Okay.

644
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,466
I am nervous. What if he says,
you, like, aren't producing any follicles,

645
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:41,800
and you're just out of luck,
and it's just not gonna happen for me?

646
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:44,233
That's sad.
I don't want to think about that.

647
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,733
-[Huang] So let's take a look here.
-[Khloe] Oh, Jesus. Okay.

648
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,100
[Huang] Ideally, I want
to see about 10, 12 follicles.

649
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,600
-That means your ovaries are still young.
-Okay.

650
00:33:56,666 --> 00:34:01,133
-[Huang] So, let's take a look here.
-[Khloe] Oh, Jesus. Okay.

651
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:05,000
[Huang] See this round thing?
That's your uterus.

652
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:08,199
-The uterus looks very normal, okay.
-Phew.

653
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:10,766
-[Huang] So this is a follicle.
-[Khloe] Holy [bleep].

654
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:15,100
-[Khloe] How many?
-[Huang] So here's one, two, three, five.

655
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:17,900
-About seven on this side.
-Ooh.

656
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:19,766
-[Kourtney whoops]
-This is good.

657
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:20,966
[Khloe laughs]

658
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,199
This is what we expect from a 32-year-old.

659
00:34:23,266 --> 00:34:25,433
-[Khloe] Okay.
-[Huang] Even better on this side. Look.

660
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,333
-Oh, my God, I could feed an army.
-[Huang laughs]

661
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,366
-Who wants an omelet?
-[Huang] So, on this side...

662
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:33,166
[Kourtney] Ooh, one, two,
three, four, five, six.

663
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:35,633
-[Huang] Almost ten on this side.
-[Khloe whoops]

664
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,166
-You said ten...
-[Huang] There's more.

665
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:38,566
Holy [bleep].

666
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:43,366
It was all my birth control,
and as soon as I get the hormones

667
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:46,600
out of my system, I'm literally,
like, the [bleep] Easter Bunny.

668
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:47,699
I'm filled with eggs.

669
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:49,733
[Huang] So, if you're
trying to get pregnant,

670
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,566
then the time is coming up
where you want to be busy.

671
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:56,600
If you're not trying to, then you
want to be careful the next couple days.

672
00:34:56,666 --> 00:35:00,266
Like, when? 'Cause I'm seeing
Tristan Monday for a week.

673
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,433
You'll probably ovulate
in the next few days.

674
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
-I can't have sex next week?
-[Huang] You...

675
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:06,466
No, you can have sex.

676
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,966
You just have to use protection.
if you're not trying to get...

677
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:11,633
-Why not try?
-[Khloe] What?

678
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,833
-[Huang] I'll meet you in the office.
-Okay. [laughs]

679
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,600
I am so relieved to know
that I am able to get pregnant.

680
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:22,466
[Khloe exhales]
The weight's off my shoulders there.

681
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:25,500
Now I have so many
other things to think about:

682
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:28,400
Do I want to have my own baby now?
I don't know.

683
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:31,800
So I'm at a crossroads
in life, guys. [laughs]

684
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:34,533
Remember, you're about to ovulate.
Keep that in mind.

685
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,500
Oh, I am. Thank you.

686
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:39,000
No, what am I gonna do? Seriously.

687
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:41,500

-[phone rings]
-[Tristan] <i>Yes, baby?</i>

689
00:35:45,566 --> 00:35:47,700
{\an8}Kourtney, what'd the doctor say?

690
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:49,800
{\an8}That we have to be careful, right?

691
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:53,833
-Well, he said you're about to ovulate.
-Yeah.

692
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,266
And she has one very juicy-looking egg.

693
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:59,700
I have 17 follicles.

694
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:03,766
-[Tristan]<i> You got that juicy egg, girl.</i>
-But one is about to drop.

695
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:06,200
-One is about to be popping off.

697
00:36:12,366 --> 00:36:14,166
-Scrambled.

-[Tristan] <i>I love you, too.</i>

701
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,933
[Kim] You would've
been really proud of me.

702
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,366
There was a tough decision
with my lip kit collab with Kylie.

703
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:41,500
-They printed the cap color wrong.
-[Khloe] Okay.

704
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,366
1.4 million plastic caps.

705
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:47,066
They said, "We'll reproduce them
and we'll toss these."

706
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:50,700
And I said, "You know what?
For the environment, let's keep it.

707
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:53,066
And hopefully no one will notice."

708
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:56,100
I feel like Leonardo DiCaprio
would be really proud of you.

709
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,433
-[Kim] Totally.
-It's like you own a Prius.

710
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,733
I went to Dr. Huang and he said,
"You know, when I saw you last,

711
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,466
you had ovaries of a 45-year-old."

712
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:10,633
But this time he said
that I actually look great.

713
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,700
-Wow.
-That birth control affects me...

714
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:16,433
My body reacts really well to it,
which is what it should do,

715
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,833
but he also is nervous for me
to, like, stay on birth control.

716
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,633
So you don't have to go freeze?

717
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,433
No, but he says, like, I should
freeze them. Just put them in the bank.

718
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,666
What does Tristan say just
about getting off of birth control,

719
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:31,900
freezing your eggs and all that?

720
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:40,566
What does Tristan say
just about getting off of birth control,

721
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,433
freezing your eggs and all that?

722
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,033
He wants to have kids now.

723
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,933
He's like, "I want to have kids
with you, da, da, da."

724
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,766
And Tristan was like,
"And then if you get pregnant,

725
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:55,300
you could make maternity jeans
for Good American."

726
00:37:56,433 --> 00:37:59,600
He's so [bleep] cute and supportive
and sweet. I've never had...

727
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:03,566
And he's, like, such a nice, nice person.

728
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:08,400
Tristan and I definitely
talk about starting a family.

729
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:13,533
Um, he wants to have, like,
five or six kids with me,

730
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,433
and that's, uh, lovely.

731
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,766
We could start at one and grow from there.

732
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:20,600
But now, knowing I'm not on birth control,

733
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:24,366
it's scary, it's a really big step, but...

734
00:38:24,433 --> 00:38:27,000
Who can I get to carry my kid?

735
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:29,166
It's annoying, this whole pregnancy thing.

736
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,833
But I honestly would say
if you could go through it

737
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,433
and have those experiences...

738
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,266
None of yours are positive.

739
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,833
But I still came out of it okay,
and I still feel like,

740
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,933
"Holy [bleep], I did it."

741
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,000
And the kids are amazing.

742
