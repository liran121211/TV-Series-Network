{\an8}-[Kris] She's gonna give us both a facial?
-[Caitlyn] <i>Yeah. I thought, what the heck!</i>

3
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:12,233
{\an8}I think you should do it.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,500
{\an8}My emotions are a roller coaster
when it comes to Cait,

5
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:20,333
{\an8}but I definitely think it's healthier,
as a family, to have a relationship.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,766
{\an8}[Kim] Did Cait bring the book over?

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,833
{\an8}I've never been so angry
and disappointed in somebody

{\an8}[Kendall] Your Internet sucks! Sorry.

11
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,766
Can you explain to me
what exactly is happening?

12
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,333
You do know about Jay Leno's Garage.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,033
How much do you know about that car,
'cause he'll ask you about it?

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,800
[Kendall] I knew it was gonna be a thing.

15
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:49,866
-Now, how much do you know?
-[Kendall] Oh, no.

16
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:53,666
[Caitlyn] I'll give you things to say,
and you can get away with it.

17
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:57,766
I know that when I shifted...
I know personal things about the car.

18
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,600
-That I've learned.
-[Caitlyn] Like what? Like what?

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,066
[Kendall] I didn't know
there was gonna be a test.

20
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:08,000
I can tell some funny stories,
like you wanted to paint it gray...

21
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:11,366
-I still do, so don't tell that story.
-You can't! Not in a mill...

22
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,066
-You don't want to paint it gray.
-Don't!

23
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,500
-That is the coolest color.
-Don't make me look stupid then!

24
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:16,966
So, don't say that.

25
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:21,566
{\an8}[Jay] Hi, kids.
-Wait. I'm trying to explain to her...

26
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:25,300
-What is that?
-If she wanted to repaint the car...

27
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:27,233
-You can't repaint the car.
-[laughter]

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,200
Thank you, Jay. Thank you. Thank you.

29
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:31,000
What would be an analogy?

30
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:33,866
You get a Prada bag,
you rip off the Prada thing.

31
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,566
-[Caitlyn and Kendall] Yeah.
-And put some other name on it.

32
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:38,500
-Yeah.
-[Jay] I'm trying to make an analogy.

33
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,733
[Caitlyn] There isn't.
So, anyway, we're working on it.

34

-Great. So cool, I can't stand it.

40
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:00,533
-[Jay] 265, right?
-[Caitlyn] Yeah. Kendall loves driving it.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,233
-Does it attract any attention?
-So much.

42
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,366
I get a lot of attention
from old men, which is great.

43
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,833
-Oh, really?
-I'm shocked.

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,800
No, they always...

45
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:11,166
I'm shocked creepy old guys
would be attracted...

Driving a hot Corvette?

47
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,133
It's so funny. They'll pull up,
and be like, "Such a nice car.

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,766
It's your dad's, right?"
I'm like, "No, it's mine."

49
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,166
-Is that what they say: "It's your dad's"?
-They're like, "I'm sure it's your dad's."

50
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:23,966
I'm like, "No, it's my car."

51
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,733
The great thing is,
it's only got two seats.

-Sorry, pal.
-Sorry, Dad

-[Caitlyn] Take it.
-[Jay] All right.

55
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,900
Do it like I taught you, Kendall.

56
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:36,733
You can just yell out,
"Don't keep my daughter out too late."

-[Kendall] Bye, Dad!

Do I answer or no?

71

She's gonna be like,
"I tried to call you."

72

And what do I say?

-[Kim] I'm doing good.

I just got back yesterday.

<i>We should meet for lunch or dinner.</i>

79

-[Caitlyn] <i>Oh. Okay.</i>
-[Kim] But I could find out.

80
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:00,700
And I'll let you know.

88

and get over this,
but I feel really awkward,

'cause I've always been
the one that likes to keep the peace.

90

And I feel bad,
'cause Caitlyn is Kendall and Kylie's dad,

91
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:32,900
and I want to be really respectful.

-I have the worst cramps!

"Rob, get up to go to the gym."

"Rob, get up to go to your meeting."

-'Cause you are lying.

Don't... don't hug me like that.

106

Isn't it weird that we bleed
for five, like... three to five days

107
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:31,666
and we don't die?

108

Is that normal?

The menstrual cycle,
it just doesn't really sit right with me.

110
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,266
That just means you get to lie
in bed all day and just not do anything

111

that won the Kim Kardashian
look-alike contest?

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,033
I thought you were talking about
the girl who came to your house butt-naked

128
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,433
and I went upstairs, had sex with her,
and she perioded on the bed.

129
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,333
And then was like, "Oh."

130
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,233
And we were completely fine with it,
and then she just left after.

131

I kind of remember that story.

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,033
-[Mario] Very good. Slept late?
-I feel asleep at 5:00 p.m.

158
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,266
-And woke up at 5:00 a.m.
-[Mario] That's good.

159
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,366
Yeah.

160
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:29,933
I am in India shooting
with Mario Testino for Indian<i> Vogue.</i>

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,966
And I'm just obsessed with him.
He's the best. His energy is just amazing.

162
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:40,233
I get to travel a lot, luckily,
and experience new places.

163
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,600
In India, you feel
you're thrown into another world.

164
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,433
I landed and there were elephants
walking down the street

165
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,533
and men riding horses
around with gems all over them.

166
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,466
I think it's cool.

167
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,100
[Mario] Wow, it's amazing.

168
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,233
Okay. I think we have it.

169
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,466
Oh, my God.

170
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:58,133
[man] Beautiful.

{\an8}[dance music plays]

172
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:09,566
{\an8}I feel like my upper back
and stuff has definitely been sore.

173
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,300
{\an8}-[Joe] In a good way, you mean.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

174
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:14,200
-She doesn't know the difference,
I've learned.

175
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:16,700
-[Kourtney] I don't.
-[Khloe] She thinks she's in pain.

176
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:19,333
But I realized it's really
just muscle soreness.

177
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
[Joe] Let's go.

178
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,633

-[Joe] Eight. Nine.
-[Khloe] Oh, [bleep].

180
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,133
That's it. If you want
to go faster, go faster.

181
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Yeah, Kourt.

182
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,566
[Joe] One, and back.

183
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,300
Take your time, then. [laughs]

184
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,800
That's it.

185
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,800
You look like a <i>Family </i>Guy character.

186

[bleep]. Where the [bleep] is Robert?

187

-He's coming here?
-Yeah.

188
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,266
[Joe] Two, one.

189
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,400
He's been so good,
so it's, like, bizarre he's not here.

190
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,533
Let me call him.

-Why aren't you here?

193
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,966
{\an8}You've been so good
and haven't flaked at all recently.

194
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:07,500

<i>I'm having my personal day.</i>

196
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,700
Why?

197
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:14,633
[Rob]<i> Because I would</i>

[Khloe] You're having a meriod?

201
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,433
Rob is definitely delusional.

202
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,633
If he knew how bad and intense
period cramps are,

203
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,666
he would feel
like such a [bleep] idiot for saying this.

204
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:32,500
Like, he has no idea
what us girls go through.

205
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,733
Rob, you live down the street. Come over.

206
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,933
A meriod is not gonna cut it, my brother.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,466
Honestly, it feels like you have
someone inside your stomach

{\an8}[Kendall] It's so random you got that car.

215
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,533
-[Kourtney] Me?
-[Kendall] Yeah, why'd you get that car?

216
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,766
-[Kourtney] Did you see it?
-[Kendall] I saw it. It's out front.

217
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,166
Oh. My son's middle name is Aston.

218
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,800
And I just felt the need
to own one at one point in my life.

219
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,700
[Kendall] Yeah.
-So I thought, why not do it now?

220
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:21,833
-[Kendall] Mm-hm.
-[Kourtney] How was India?

221
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,300
[Kim and Kourtney] I've never been.

222
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,633
We stayed at this, 300-year-old palace,

223
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,233
but now it's a hotel.

224
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,233
It was really cool and beautiful.

225
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,566
-[Kourtney] Who did you go with?
-I was shooting for Indian <i>Vogue.</i>

226
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:35,133
I literally was there for,
like, a day and a half.

227
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,533
-Yeah.
-[Kendall] And it was really cool.

228
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,933
But I actually met this prince.

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,800
He's, like, um, the first gay prince
to come out in India.

230
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:47,866
-Wow.
-[Kendall] He's really awesome.

231
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,533
In India, it's not acceptable to be gay,

232
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,266
and it was really interesting
to meet Prince Manvendra

233
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,666
and hear his story.

234
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:58,600
I think what's really similar
between my dad and Prince Manvendra

235
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:02,700
is the bravery and being able
to take that chance to come out

236
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:05,400
and hope that everything goes all right.

237
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:09,466
Next time he's in town we should
set up a dinner for you guys.

238
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,666
-I want to hear...
-[Kendall] His story was interesting.

239
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,733
I had the best matcha tea yesterday.

240
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,333
[Kendall] Oh, from where?

241
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,633
From this artist's studio.

242
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,033
-What's matcha?
-I'm not meant to drink matcha.

243
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,566
-But I love it.
-Why?

244
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:25,266
-He said it's so good for you.
-[Kendall] 'Cause of my migraines.

245
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,466
-Why? Caffeine is good for you.
-No, not for my type, at least.

246
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,333
-[Kourtney] Oh, really?
-Like, my aura migraines, no.

247
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,300
-[Kim] You can't have caffeine?
-Sorry. No, I think that's for my anxiety.

258
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:10,466
So, Mom's obviously upset about it.

259
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,666
-So...
-I know.

260
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,866
That really bothers me,
but I have to be honest in the book

261
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:18,400
on how my feelings are.

262
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:21,533
[Kim] If those are your feelings,
those are your feelings.

263
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,800
But Mom, like,
she feels a way about you,

264
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:25,666
and she can feel however she wants.

265
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:26,733
Yeah.

266
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,000
You both have the right
to feel however you want.

267
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:31,566
And, you know, I'll always love her.

268
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:35,000
We'll always have 23 years
of our lives, raising all these children.

269
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:37,333
-Yeah.
-I mean, I'm not throwing that all out.

270
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,300
Well, I think that's what she thinks.

271
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:43,600
I'm gonna read it
and I'll tell you honestly if I feel,

272
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,600
like, "You know what?
I get why she's upset,"

273
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,366
or, "You know what? I don't."

274
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:50,000
This book, it's my story.

275
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,900
Everybody has stuff in life
that they have to deal with,

276
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:57,566
and this was my stuff, and this
is how I dealt with it, you know?

277
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:01,166
And in doing that, and being
so honest with yourself,

278
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:05,900
and how freeing that is to not live
your life with secrets and stuff inside

279
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:08,433
is an amazing road to travel down.

280
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,966
It's just, it's just very fulfilling.

281
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,233

-Yeah.

-Did you read the whole thing?
-Yeah.

is Mom exaggerating?

302

Like, for no reason.

303
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,933
It was like, "I didn't speak
to my sister because of Kris.

304
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,933
I didn't see my kids
because of Kris."

305
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,866
Like, grow up and say,
"I didn't call my kids."

306
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,000
And Caitlyn discredits Mom.

307
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:33,233
She said, "I didn't see
a dime of my money."

308
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,900
She was insinuating that Mom
took the check and pocketed it

309
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:39,000
and, like, had this huge savings.

310
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:43,400
Like, the part of, like, our lives
that people don't ever see

311
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:47,766
is that, for a good, like,
10 or 15 years, like,

312
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,100
when they first moved to Hidden Hills,
when no one lived there,

313
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,933
everyone thought,
"We're moving out of Beverly Hills,

314
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,033
We've got to be broke,
we've got to this."

315
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,500
Borrowing money from Grandma,
and, like, couldn't...

316
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:01,400
-From me.
-Yeah, couldn't pay the bills, like...

317
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,000
The money wasn't going in Mom's pocket.

318
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:07,233
They made the money together
and even when Mom would book appearances,

319
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,300
like, I worked for her, I would hear her
phone calls in the office.

320
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:15,400
She would, like, hustle to get speeches.
She changed Caitlyn's career.

321
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:19,900
And she made her have
this motivational speaker business.

322
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:24,666
And then she said, "The Kardashians
were so upset when their names

323
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,166
their names weren't mentioned
in Diane Sawyer, but it was deliberate.

324
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:31,000
We did research.

325
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:33,766
Any time the word "Kardashian"
was mentioned, people thought--

326
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,833
They put the word
"Kardashian" with publicity stunt.

327
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,366
And, so, we deliberately never
put the name in there."

328
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,100
And that sounds pathetic.

329
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,166
-It's so pathetic.
-That just sounds calculated.

330
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:48,933
I'm just like, "Honey, no one knew
who you were for the last few decades.

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,733
We got you more life, you know?

332
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,333
The show's not called
<i>Keeping up with the Jenners</i>."

333
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,233
Caitlyn said she invented the show

334
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,900
and she was the only one
that was famous at the time.

335
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:02,833
But it's just, whatever
her perspective is, have some class.

336
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,266
Yeah, and just respect for someone
that you've been with for that many years.

337
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,533
-In that situation, especially.
-[Kim] Yeah.

338
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,466
Never once has she said,
like, "I'm sorry" to Mom or anything.

339
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:19,033
I said, "You're allowed
to feel the way you feel.

340
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,966
My mom's allowed
to feel the way she feels."

341
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:22,533
Then why do you want to hang out?

342
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,300
Why do you want to be part of the family
if you're just gonna talk [bleep]?

343
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:27,533
So did you say that?

344
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,533
-I haven't talked to Caitlyn since then.
-Yeah.

345
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:35,866
If you turn on my mom
and you continue to bash us,

346
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,966
I can't, even for the sake
of even my sisters,

347
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:43,066
spend time with someone that
does not even care about my mother.

348
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,766
It's like, enough already.

349
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,466
You don't have to, like,
tear someone down.

350
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,533
-Let's all build each other up.
-Right.

351
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,600
While she's busy building herself up
and tearing us down.

352
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,100
-Yeah.
-[Kim] But using us.

353
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,300
{\an8}-[Reign] KoKo!
-[Khloe] Reigny!

354
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:12,966
Hello! Come here.
I was with him this morning.

355
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:15,066
-Oh...
-KoKo.

356
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,166
[Reign] KoKo.

357
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:19,700
[Khloe] Anyway, Rob, it's nice to see you.

358
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,200
[Rob] It's really good to see you guys.

359
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,433
[Khloe] I'm still waiting
to work out with you.

360
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,300
-I was on my, uh, meriod, so...
-[Scott chuckles]

361
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,300
-[Khloe] Mm-mm.
-[Scott] Are you on birth control?

362
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:33,600
'Cause if you are, it'll be
a shorter turn for your meriod.

363
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,900
[Rob] I'm thinking of getting
the new male birth control.

364
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:37,266
[Scott] Ooh.
-[Khloe] Listen.

365
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,033
If you want to joke about periods
and joke you have one...

366
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,033
-I'm talking about birth control.
-...you should suffer the consequences.

367
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,366
'Cause they're not fun.

368
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,633
-[Scott] What are the consequences?
-It can't be that bad.

369
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,233
You get cramps, you have nausea,
sometimes you throw up.

370
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,333
-I get migraines.
-[Kourtney] I don't get any of those.

371
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,433
-Me, too.
-Me, too.

372
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,633
Some girls do. It's, like, really severe.

373
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,733
-You should know what it feels like.
-[Rob] I don't care.

374
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,666
None of that stuff bothers me.
I don't fear pain.

375
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:10,033
Okay. Well, I think you should know
what it's like to feel what we feel.

376
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,400
Let's go see Rob menstruate.

377
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,166
I know about this device.

378
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,166
I know a lot of athletes do it.

379
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:21,666
If you have an injury,
it makes your muscles contract.

380
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,766
And if it's put in the wrong place,

381
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:29,600
I think it could really make
a good lasting effect on someone.

382
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,600
-[Kourtney] Hi. How are you?
-I'm Dr. Trumpi.

383
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,833
Hi. Kourtney. Nice to meet you. Come in.

384
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,033
So I figure, why not do this to Rob?

385
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,266
You want to know what a [bleep]
period cramp feels like? Be my guest.

386
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,366
-Hi. How are you?
-Good. Hey, I'm Dr. Trumpi.

387
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,933
I'm Khloe. Nice to see you.

388
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,433
[Scott] What's gonna go on in here?

389
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:54,466
This electrical machine will muscular
contractions mimicking cramps.

390
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:57,966
See, Rob? You want to make fun?
Wait till you feel this pain.

391
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,833
[Rob] Khloe enjoys [bleep] with me.

392
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,266
She obviously doesn't
have anything better to do

393
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,233
since she's on her period or whatever.

394
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,700
I'm curious
to what this is gonna feel like,

395
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:12,000
but, regardless of whatever
Khloe's plan is,

396
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,533
I don't think it'll be that bad.

397
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,066
We'll hook these up: electrodes on you,
so you can have some empathy

398
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,666
for all
your females around you, right?

399
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,433
What you need to do is relax here.

400
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,266
We'll put these here first, okay?

401
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:26,300
We'll start just with two. We have eight
electrodes, but we'll start with two.

402
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:29,466
-Hold on to something. Hold her hand.
-[Rob] Oh, [bleep]. Don't torture me.

403
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:32,500
-[Dr. Trumpi] Okay, you ready?
-[electrodes buzzing]

404
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,300
{\an8}We'll start with two. We have
eight electrodes. We'll start with two.

405
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:41,666
-Hold on to something. Hold her hand.
-Oh, [bleep]. Don't torture me.

406
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,766
You ready?
Okay, I'm gonna go real slow.

407
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,533
So you get a sensation
of what it feels like.

408
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,633
-[Rob] All right.
-[electrodes buzzing]

409
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,200
I'm gonna turn it up a little bit.
I'm gonna go slow.

410
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:51,366
[Rob laughs] Just a little.

411
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:55,000
[Scott] Could this stimulate him
ejaculate?

412
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:57,333
-[Dr. Trumpi] Not this time.
-[Rob] Oh, not this time.

413
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,866
[laughter]

414
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:02,366
-Okay, ready?
-I'm touching my sister's hand.

415
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:05,366
-I'm gonna keep going. Tell me when...
-[Rob] I just contract when I laugh.

416
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:07,566
-When I'm not trying to think about it.
-Relax.

417
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,766
That's what I do
in the tattoo appointments. [he groans]

418
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,900
-Does it really hurt?
-[Dr. Trumpi] Does it hurt?

419
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:14,366
-[Rob] Yeah.
-Does it really?

420
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:15,433
[Dr. Trumpi] All right.

421
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,133
[Khloe voiceover] <i>Apparently,</i>
<i>my meriod cramp device worked.</i>

422
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,533
And it's not that I want
my brother to endure pain,

423
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,200
but I want him to know what I have
to go through every single month.

424
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:29,600
So I feel like I need
this cramp device in my back pocket

425
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,133
whenever he has an excuse.

426
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,066
I go ahead and give him some cramps.

427
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:36,266
So do you feel, like, more sympathetic
towards them now or no?

428
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,633
I mean, yeah, I respect
a woman who gives birth

429
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,233
and has periods all the time.

430
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,066
[Scott] It must have sucked.

431
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:46,433
[dance music plays]

432
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,866
{\an8}-[Kim] Mom?
-[Kris] Hey, I'm in the office.

433
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,933

-Hey. You look nice.

434
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,666
-Well, thanks, so do you.

-[Khloe]<i> Bye, you guys.</i>
-[Kris] Bye.

446
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:43,733
So... I read Caitlyn's book.

447
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,500
-Stop.
-Yeah.

448
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:46,766
And?

449
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,733
She has her thoughts,
and you have your thoughts.

450
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,600
That's fine, but I do feel like there's
a way to tell your side of the story

451
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,900
without being so negative.

452
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:59,566
Like, everything is always your fault.

453
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:01,100
Absolutely.

454
00:23:01,766 --> 00:23:05,300
I think what she doesn't realize,
when it says you got all the checks,

455
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:06,666
yeah, it was a household.

456
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:10,500
She never paid a bill from 1972.

457
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:13,066
-You were in charge of that.
-Didn't know how much a gardener was.

458
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:16,633
And in the book writes,
"Well, Kris didn't need me anymore.

459
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,066
All of the checks for <i>Keeping Up</i>
<i>With The Kardashians</i> all went to Kris."

460
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,533
"Went to Kris"?

461
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,200
How about it went to the mortgage,
the insurance, and education?

462
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:31,800
You start talking about how I was hoarding
money, when we didn't even have it?

463
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,333
You know when you get to know
somebody and you're dating?

464
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,100
And I said to Cait,
"You were married before.

465
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,966
How did you and your wife break up?"

466
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:45,366
She weaves this elaborate story
about how she and Linda broke up.

467
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:50,033
Cait could've told me the story
that she writes about in the book,

468
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,833
which is, gee,

469
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:58,166
Linda got so angry and nasty that she had
to tell her about her gender dysphoria.

470
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:00,966
Why wouldn't you have
told me what happened with Linda,

471
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:03,966
so I could make my own decision
if I wanted to get married

472
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:06,433
to someone who really
wanted to be a woman?

473
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,900
She just literally started three families

474
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,433
with three different people
and [bleep] everyone over.

475
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,900
100 percent.

476
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:16,233
But can't handle that negative publicity,

477
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,900
so I'm gonna be the scapegoat.

478
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:21,000
-She's gonna throw me under the bus.
-It's so wack.

479
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:22,733
Like, it really is so wack.

480
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:31,233
If this is the way that someone
feels about me after 23 years

481
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,366
and about
all the wonderful memories that I have...

482
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,500
[voice breaks] ...then...
it's just better for me to say,

483
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:42,000
"You know what? I have my own
memories, and they were great.

484
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:47,666
And the last five years were hard,
but I still have those great memories."

485
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:53,000
So I choose to be the bigger person
and just wish them well.

486
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:55,900
And I feel sorry for her

487
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:59,333
that this is how she has her memories.

488
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,166
100 percent.

489
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,166
[Kim voiceover]
<i>My mom has been so fair to Cait.</i>

490
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:08,800
And Cait just has no decency
towards my mom, whatsoever.

491
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:10,100
It's just hurtful.

492
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,766
I feel like my mom is
carrying this burden of feeling

493
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:16,300
like she has to maintain a relationship
with Caitlyn for all the kids.

494
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:19,866
Like, we're grown up. I don't think
my mom has to try anymore.

495
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:21,600
It's time to move on.

496
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:25,600
I just, like, have no respect
for her anymore.

497
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:29,066
Someone that had this perspective,
I wouldn't even want around.

498
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,833
Over it.

499
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,166
Done.

500
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,666
[Khloe] Can't even see.

501
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,366
-Perfect.
-[doorbell rings]

502
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:57,333
-[Kim] So nice to meet you.
-[Manvendra] How are you?

503
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,866
{\an8}-Hello. I'm Prince Manvendra from India.
-I'm Kim.

504
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,933
{\an8}[Kim] So nice to meet you. Come in.

505
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,933
-You got a beautiful house.
-Thank you.

506
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,933
-How are you?
-[Manvendra] How are you?

507
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,566
-Nice to see you.
-[Kim] Kourtney.

508
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,000
-Hi. How are you?
-[Khloe] Hi.

509
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:11,800
-[Kim] Khloe.
-Nice to see you.

510
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:13,200
-[Kim] Beautiful outfit.
-Thanks.

511
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:15,533
-Do you want to sit down?
-[Manvendra] Yeah.

512
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,366
Did you just come from India?

513
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:23,833
We went to San Francisco to raise funds
to make our LGBTA center,

514
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,700
community center, "A" stands for allies.

515
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:29,100
-That's the first one in India.
-[all] Oh, wow.

516
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:33,266
I knew that my coming out
would definitely make a difference.

517
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,766
How was the response publicly?

518
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:37,900
My God, don't even ask me what happened.

519
00:26:37,966 --> 00:26:39,800
[laughter]

520
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:44,100
The first reaction
was they all set a bonfire

521
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:45,966
and they burned my effigies in that.

522
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:47,566
-[Kendall gasps]
-The whole town.

523
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:51,066
They got together, and there was
protests going on everywhere,

524
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:54,400
and they said,
"He's put a shame to the royal family.

525
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:56,333
He should be stripped of his title."

526
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,766
If your parents wanted to could they
strip you of your title and banish you?

527
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,700
-They did, in fact.
-[Khloe] Oh, they did.

528
00:27:02,766 --> 00:27:07,366
So, uh, my parents publicly
disowned me from the royal family.

529
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:12,133
-[Khloe] Oh...
-They also disinherited me.

530
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,266
-From the ancestral property.
-[Khloe] Oh.

531
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,900
-[Kendall] Wow.
-Yes, so...

532
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:17,866
Have you spoken to your parents since?

533
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:20,366
Yeah, then, things did improve.

534
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:24,833
I have to educate them, I have to make
them aware what is right, what is wrong.

535
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,433
And media helped me a lot.

536
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,900
Media, print media and television media,
that helped change their minds.

537
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:34,933
Once people feel
like other people will accept it,

538
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,800
then it must not be that bad.

539
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:37,766
Exactly.

540
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:41,233
The more they hear about it,
the more common it becomes.

541
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,333
I mean, even just
with our situation, your dad.

542
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,433
It's, like, 20 years ago,
if you heard someone was transgender...

543
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,833
-That would be... [gasps]
-[Kendall] Yeah.

544
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,400
-Now, it's, like...
-Someone said the other night:

545
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:58,533
"Before she publicly came out,
we heard she might publicly come out."

546
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,800
And they were nervous.
They were like, "I don't know if America

547
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:03,800
or the world is ready for this."

548
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:08,533
Mm-hm. I was so happy for her soul
that is was a positive reaction.

549
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,166
-I can only imagine...
-[Kendall] It could have been bad.

550
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:14,200
...you know, how strong
you have to be to...

551
00:28:14,266 --> 00:28:16,566
Really, I mean,
and how scared you must be.

552
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,966
When did you know?

553
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:22,700
It was around 12 or 13, I guess. I mean...

554
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:25,933
But you still got married to a woman?

555
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,133
Mine was arranged. I was shown a number
of princesses from across the country.

556
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,733
-[Kim] Oh, and you pick?
-I picked one who I thought I would...

557
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,133
-Assuming I'm straight.
-[laughter]

558
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,933
-You know?
-Do you still speak with her?

559
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,233
Uh, no, I don't speak to her anymore.

560
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,200
But, uh, I mean, I haven't
spoken to her after our divorce,

561
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:52,466
because, um, it really hit me
hard on my heart,

562
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:55,533
because those moments of living with her,

563
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,466
I realized that, uh, I kind of
made the biggest mistake.

564
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,366
We kind of mutually decided.

565
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:04,966
I said, no, I can't keep her
in this, uh, way.

566
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:09,266
I can't continue with this kind
of a torture, I would say, for her.

567
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,900
-It's amazing of you, to do that.
-I said, it's not right.

568
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,366
Do you know if she's married now?

569
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:16,900
-Yeah, yeah.
-Oh, she is?

570
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:20,100
So, because it's very difficult,
in India especially,

571
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:24,500
for girls to get married after divorce,
I mean, I was just praying.

572
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,833
I said, I just wish she gets married,

573
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,500
'cause, like, my satisfaction
was that she got married.

574
00:29:30,566 --> 00:29:35,000
That was itself the beginning stage
of my... my coming out.

575
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:40,100
Till then, I was feeling very guilty after
this whole... this whole thing happened.

576
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:45,000
And to be so thoughtful of her...
It shows really great character.

577
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:49,133
I think coming out
is such a personal decision

578
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,933
that you have to do it in your own time,

579
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,566
but I think that it's really
commendable that he waited

580
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:58,533
his wife remarried to come out,

581
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,600
because he was so sensitive
to her experience.

582
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,800
The last words of her I still remember.
She told me just before we parted ways:

583
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:10,633
"You have tried to spoil my life.

584
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,133
I would advise you please don't
do it to another woman."

585
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,966
I feel like there are some similarities
between Prince Manvendra's stories

586
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:22,933
and my parents' stories, so I would
like my mom to meet him and talk to him.

587
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,133
I think it could be really interesting.

588
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:30,466
I have friends or relatives,
who have known her

589
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:33,133
and, uh, she seems
to be enjoying her life.

590
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,333
-[Kim] That must make you feel good.
-[Manvendra] Yeah, I mean, of course.

591
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,733
But sometimes I go back, flash back,

592
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,000
and I again think, "Oh God, why did
I cause so much of misery to her?"

593
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,766
It's really clear
that the prince and Caitlyn

594
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,266
handled their situations
totally differently.

595
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:53,433
I know Kendall's such a daddy's girl,
but I think it's important to understand

596
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,400
what my mom's been going through
just so that Kendall knows both sides.

597
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:04,766
It seems like such a simple thing,
just to be who you are.

598
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,133
-But it's really not.
-Yeah.

599
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,366
You know, and so many...
for so many different people.

600
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,433
Exactly.

601
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:14,200
[electronic dance plays]

602
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,266
{\an8}[Kim] What does this thing say?

603
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,200
{\an8}[Kendall] The artist is Tracey Emin.

604
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,900
And the dimensions of her
ex-boyfriend's [bleep].

605
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,233
So he has a really big [bleep]

606
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,933
and the message
is to his new girlfriend saying,

607
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,766
"I'm glad to hear you're happy."

608
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,400
-Do you like the placement over my bed?
-That is so funny.

609
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:36,400
-[Kendall] It's good, right?
-It's 22 centimeters.

610
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:40,033
-[Kendall] Yeah, it's big. I think, right?
-[Kim] So funny.

611
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,866
I, uh, I finally read your dad's book.

612
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,600
-You read the whole thing?
-[Kim] Yeah.

613
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:52,100
There's just certain things that you
don't have to say about my mom.

614
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:56,500
I feel like my mom always holds
in her feelings to her kids

615
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:58,800
'cause she doesn't want us to pick sides.

616
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:01,833
She doesn't want us
to be in that position.

617
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,700
I feel like Kendall should know.
She should know what the book says.

618
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:07,633
And then she should know
what my mom's feelings are.

619
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,500
I just want to treat Kendall
like an adult and give her the truth.

620
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:12,433
I think we always baby her and Kylie,

621
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,733
thinking they're the babies
of the family and they're not.

622
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,866
They're grown now.

623
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,633
Like, what did she say?

624
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,366
{\an8}[Kendall] Like, what did she say?

625
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:29,400
There's a way to tell
your story without being so negative.

626
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:32,333
Like she says in the book: "Kris knew."

627
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,833
But Kris knew what?
You're making it seem like Kris knew:

628
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,966
"I'm transgender.
I feel like I'm in the wrong body."

629
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:41,200
And then she goes, "Oh, Kris knew.

630
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:46,833
I said that I, you know, liked to dress up
and she said "Don't do that here."

631
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,566
Or something like that. And I go,
you know what? She was 30-years-old.

632
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:55,366
She loved you. She probably didn't
know what you even meant.

633
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:59,633
Then Cait said, "Every check Kris and I
got, she wouldn't let me write a check.

634
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,166
She wouldn't let me write anything.
Kris got all the money."

635
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,766
Where do you think that money went to?

636
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:07,333
You're making it sound
like she just went shopping.

637
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,433
But you guys had to pay for the home,
insurance, health insurance...

638
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,266
Yeah, she wasn't out buying
crazy stuff with your money.

639
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,933
They hardly had any money
and they were putting it into an account,

640
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,900
paying taxes, and doing this
and paying old bills.

641
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:22,366
And then, with her transition,

642
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,566
she goes,
"Those kids felt a way about it."

643
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:27,266
Like, made it, you know,
said that we were so upset.

644
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:31,566
-That's so awful to say about your family.
-Totally.

645
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:34,933
Like, the kids that, like...
You met Robert when he was two.

646
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,233
-[Kim] Totally.
-[Kendall] You helped raise you guys.

647
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,166
-But if I was apart...
-Those are partly your kids, too.

648
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:42,400
-Totally.
-What the [bleep]?

649
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:44,133
In the back of the book, she says,

650
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,966
"And when we did Diane Sawyer,
we specifically took out

651
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:52,066
every reference that said
Kardashian or insinuation to them.

652
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:54,800
We did research, and studies show..."

653
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,833
And I'm like, instead
of having our back and, like...

654
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,333
Like, if you're not gonna mention
our name, or your name, fine,

655
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,800
but don't diss it
at the end of your thing.

656
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:06,533
It's like a backhanded... yeah.

657
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,666
Yeah. You should, like,
make it seem better and help.

658
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:14,666
I think what upset me
the most about my dad's book

659
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:18,166
is what she had said about my family

660
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:21,100
because, at the end of the day,
she raised the Kardashians.

661
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:23,666
And at the end of the day,
the Kardashians are still part

662
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:27,433
of my blood, so I understand where
my mom's coming from a bit more now.

663
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,800
So I think that just that little...

664
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:32,766
She's pushing herself further
and further away from all of us.

665
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:36,566
And then she complains, like,
"Why don't you come and hang out with me?

666
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:39,433
And it's, like,
"Because you're being mean."

667
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,866
-[Kim] Yeah.
-[Kendall] I don't know what got into her.

668
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:44,699
[bouncy dance music plays]

669
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:53,566
{\an8}[doorbell rings]

670
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,500
-Hi, Kris.
-Hello. How are you?

671
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,433
-You must be Prince Manvendra.
-Yes.

672
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,566
There's not many people that come
to my door in such beautiful garments.

673
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:07,233
-You look so beautiful.
-Yeah, thank you.

674
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,666
Amazing. Come on in. My girls have said
so many wonderful things about you.

675
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:13,733
-Oh, have they?
-They can't say enough.

676
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,633
They had a beautiful meeting with you.

677
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,133
-How are you?
-Yeah, I'm doing great.

678
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,866
And I'm so happy to meet you.

679
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:22,966
-I've heard so much about you, and...
-You have?

680
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:27,133
Yes, and I wanted to meet you
to... to talk to you.

681
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,966
I was fascinated with your story,

682
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:35,000
because you did something
that was so against your culture.

683
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,100
[Manvendra] Mm-hm.

684
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:40,200
And the price you had
to pay is extraordinary.

685
00:35:40,266 --> 00:35:43,333
And that's--
I mean, I admire you for your strength.

686
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,800
-Thank you.
-[Kris] And for being true to yourself.

687
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:50,933
And I'm not sure why your story
makes so much sense Caitlyn's doesn't,

688
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,333
But what do you think
was the biggest thing

689
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,366
that you had to face
when you finally said,

690
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:01,633
"This isn't me. I'm gay"?

691
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,800
-My life.
-Yeah.

692
00:36:03,866 --> 00:36:06,233
There's nothing more precious
than your own life.

693
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,933
You can get a house, you can get husband,
but you can't get a life back.

694
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,133
-So I sacrificed my old life.
-How long were you married?

695
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,933
I was married for,
uh, 16 months, I would say.

696
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,433
-[Kris] Oh, wow.
-Yes.

697
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,900
-Mine lasted 23 years.
-[Manvendra] My goodness.

698
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:26,933
I felt like I was married to someone

699
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,600
who really wanted to be married to me.

700
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:32,566
And then to suddenly,
you know, wake up one day

701
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:37,766
and realize that wasn't gonna be
the end of your chapter, is devastating.

702
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:43,266
Somewhere down the line, she will
also be having a feeling of guilt.

703
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:46,466
Or like a, "Why did I do that to her?"

704
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:52,166
It's very liberating for me
to be able to talk somebody else

705
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:55,500
who's gone through a similar situation.

706
00:36:55,566 --> 00:37:00,933
And to have someone
really validate that it's okay to feel

707
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,700
the way that I've been feeling,

708
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:06,066
and that sooner or later
it does get a little bit better.

709
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:09,033
The way that you've treated your ex-wife

710
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,266
gives me hope that there are
people out there like you

711
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:17,700
that are very considerate, and loving,
and caring and that's a big deal.

712
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:22,866
I'm just hoping that you also get treated
the same-- similar manner by, uh...

713
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:27,000
-[Kris] Aw, maybe one day.
-One day. I have, I have that hope.

714
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:29,066
-Thank you.
-That positive, uh, hope.

715
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:31,300
-And, um, I believe in destiny.
-I do, too.

716
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:35,333
Yes. And I believe that
when two strangers are meeting,

717
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,233
they're meeting for a purpose,
and for a good purpose.

718
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,000
If I'm meeting you today, I'm sure there's
something good coming in your life.

719
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:43,566
Aw, thank you.

720
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:47,800
I will definitely pray and wish
something good comes

721
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:51,066
and you will live a very happy,
satisfied life.

722
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:55,133
And if you'll be happy, I'm sure you'll
give more happiness your daughters.

723
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:08,000
{\an8}[Kris] Did you see my sheep? These
are the bronze ones that live outside.

724
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:12,500
[in squeaky voice] And this is
what I got! My little babies! Look.

725
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:15,233
I can tell you miss Kylie and I a lot.

726
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,500
[Kris] The mommy and the baby.
All right, come here.

727
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:21,400
I'm gonna make you look at my sheep.
They're right here.

728
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:24,200
[Kris claps, laughs]

729
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:27,200
-Aren't they cute?
-Why don't you trim your grass?

730
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:30,566
It's just trying to grow back
after all the rain. We'll replace it.

731
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:33,333
-Aren't they cute?
-[Kendall] So cute.

732
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,633
[Kris] I know.

733
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:38,600
I spoke to Kim about Dad's book.

734
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:41,666
And I heard about all the stuff
she was saying in it.

735
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,000
-[Kris] Mm-hm.
-How a lot of it's so not true.

736
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:45,066
[Kris] Yeah.

737
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:48,800
The weird part is
I don't think it's a purposeful lying.

738
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:51,400
-Yeah.
-I think she thinks that's what happened.

739
00:38:51,466 --> 00:38:52,633
For some weird reason.

740
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,166
It could've been handled
in the most amazing, loving way.

741
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:59,800
Talk about your journey
and keep it to that.

742
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:01,900
That I would've had great respect for.

743
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:06,100
Don't talk about it
in a real negative way.

744
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:09,800
Like, everything was, like,
I am such a bad person.

745
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:13,800
There's lies that are printed in a book

746
00:39:13,866 --> 00:39:16,500
that lives there for the end of time.

747
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:21,200
So your children are gonna read
this book about their grandparent

748
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:24,200
and have a story that's fabricated.

749
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:27,833
-That's in print and is a fabrication.
-Yeah, you're right.

750
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,000
And then she goes around dissing
the Kardashians,

751
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:35,300
but it's, like, those are
the kids that you raised.

752
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:38,266
If you have a problem
with them, you raised them.

753
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:43,166
It makes no sense to me that she would
go around bashing us for no reason.

754
00:39:43,233 --> 00:39:45,233
It's insane, Mom.

755
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,066
That's insane!

756
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,533
{\an8}[Kendall] It's insane, Mom.

757
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,466
It blows my mind that she would do that.

758
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:57,566
-But here's what you have to understand.
-It's insane, Mom.

759
00:39:57,633 --> 00:39:59,233
Here's what you have to understand:

760
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,366
She walked away from four other kids,

761
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,600
and then turned around
and blamed it on me.

762
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:05,633
Yeah.

763
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,100
This was kind of like my final straw.

764
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:13,233
And, at some point, I just have to let
it go because it's too painful to bear.

765
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,633
It sucks, but, like, it's not worth
putting too much energy towards it.

766
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,066
But if that's, like, making you stressed,
like, it's not your fault.

767
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:23,166
Yeah. I appreciate that.

768
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,100
My mom has been
pretty protective over Kylie and I

769
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,033
and I can really appreciate it,

770
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,633
but at the same time,
I think Kylie and I are old enough now

771
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,733
to try and deal with it on our own.

772
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,566
I mean, my dad is my dad,
I'll always love my dad.

773
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:41,800
I love my dad to death. But I think my mom
needed to know that it will all be okay.

774
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:46,433
And that we'll be fine.
And I just... needed her to know that.

775
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,800
It's unfortunate, 'cause that part,
that connection is falling apart.

776
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,600
But that's okay.
I've learned to be okay with it.

777
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:57,866
I just never want you
to feel like I don't love you

778
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:00,600
more than anything
in the whole, entire world.

779
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:05,200
Thanks for just being you.
You have a heart of gold.

780
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:06,766
A heart of gold.

781
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:11,600
-'Kay, I'm leaving.
-You don't want some turkey meat loaf?

782
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:14,066
-Sure don't.
-Give me a kiss. And a hug.

783
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:17,733
No kisses. 'Cause you have
so much makeup on.

784
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,533
Mom, please, seriously, seriously.
Mom, this gross!

785
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,300
-This is so gross.
-Okay.

786
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:24,633
Look at your lipstick
that you have on. It's so weird.

787
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,666
-You look like you have a hickey.
-That's gross.

788
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:29,666
{\an8}Awesome. Moms are gross.
That's what happens.

789
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:32,000
{\an8}Better leave or I'm gonna kiss you again.

790
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:34,333
-I'm gonna get you.
-[Kendall] Leave me alone.

[she laughs] I'm gonna get you.

00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:41,500
When do you think
you're gonna start dating again?

794
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:43,566
Hi. How are you? Kourtney.

795
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:45,333
[Kris] We're discussing
your birthday party.

796
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,433
So we got Disneyland. Is that good?

797
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,600
That doesn't...

798
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:51,233
[Khloe] This is something
you want to do, Rob.

799
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,066
I wonder how Tristan would feel.

800
00:41:53,133 --> 00:41:56,166
"I'm pregnant,
but it's not yours and it's not mine."

801
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:59,666
Having Khloe be my surrogate
would give me peace of mind.

802
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:02,500
There are fewer follicles
than for normal 32-year-olds.

803
00:42:02,566 --> 00:42:04,433
[Khloe] Shut the [bleep] up.
