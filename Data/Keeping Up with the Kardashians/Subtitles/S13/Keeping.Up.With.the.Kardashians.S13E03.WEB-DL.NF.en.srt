320
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:01,533
Like, he thinks what he's doing
is normal and fine.

321
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:06,433
Being in the public eye is
pretty crazy, just because

322
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,466
people actually feel like they know you.

323

to me as if I knew who he was.

328
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,200

479
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:23,833
[Kris] Ever since we returned from Paris,
I've been interviewing companies,

480
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:30,500
sure that we find the most qualified team
to take care of such a big family.

481
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:31,533
[Corey] What's up?

482
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,966
[Kris] Just trying to figure
out the security, babe.

483
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:35,933
[Corey] You should relax
and shut it down tonight.

484
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,200
[Kris] Everybody in a direction.
-[Corey] I've done...

485
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:40,300
[Kris] I don't know what...
[Corey] I... I did that.

486
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:42,800
I told you, I got the chart ready
for you by the bed.

487
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:43,900
Look at it in the bed.

488
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:48,666
[Kris] I appreciate everything Corey does.
He has such a background in security,

489
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:51,433
but I have to pick the perfect team
myself,

490
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,166
because nobody's gonna protect my kids
like me.

491
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:58,033
I think I'll finally relax when
I feel like everybody's covered

492
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,500
24-7, and then I can breathe again.

493
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,133
I just want them to feel safe.

494
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,333
I don't even care about myself
anymore, I swear to God.

495
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000

[Kendall] Yeah.

498
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:21,833
[Kim] It says, like, "California,"
and this is, like, the crest.

499
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,800
-This says "Las Virgenes."
-[Kendall laughs softly]

500
00:24:24,866 --> 00:24:26,533
[Kendall] These colors are really cool.

501
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,866
[Kim] These are all in the show,
these with jackets.

502
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,966
What's going on?

503
00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:35,133
[Kendall] Not much.

504
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,166
Dude, I don't think I want to testify.

505
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:42,366
[Kim] Why?

506
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:44,700
[Kendall] Because I feel really bad.
Is that weird?

507
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:47,933
He's, like, mentally challenged.

508
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,833
I don't know.

509
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:53,100
-It makes me really sad.
-[Kim] But that's not your responsibility.

510
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,966
Like, after Paris,
our lives are so different.

511
00:24:57,033 --> 00:25:01,233
Like, I can't sleep unless I have, like,
four security guards

512
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,466
just outside my house.

513
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:05,200
If you don't set the tone for it now,

514
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:06,900
you're not gonna be able
to sleep at night.

515
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,700
[Kendall] Mm. That's true.

516
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:12,966
[Kim] Kendall is so sweet,
sensitive and caring,

517
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:16,700
and she feels so guilty having to testify.

518
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:21,000
I understand that,
but this guy could've really hurt her.

519
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,766
So she has to protect herself
first and foremost.

520
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:27,433
You're lucky, obviously,
in a sense that, like, nothing happened.

521
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,333
He didn't do anything, you know, to you,

522
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,433
which it could've gotten
really out of hand.

523
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,100
[Kendall] I mean, the thought
of even having to see him

524
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:40,000
in court freaks me out,
and it0 just gives me crazy anxiety.

525
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:42,800
[Kim] I know, but you just have to, like,
fight through it.

526
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:45,833
[Kendall] Yeah, I guess.
I want to be protected,

527
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,366
obviously, but I'm conflicted.

528
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:51,066
Like, can't we just send him to a hospital

529
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,866
where he can get the help that he needs?

530
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:57,300

but scary at the same time.

is the right thing to do.

to let it be handled properly.

636
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,666
You running over to a violent
situation into a house,

637
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:52,966
two or three intruders,
what the hell you gonna do?

638
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,600
[Kris] I can't forgive myself
for what happened.

639
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:00,066
[Corey] It's not your fault.

640
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,633
[Kris] Yeah, but you just...
That's not how your mind works,

641
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,233
when you feel like you could've done
something to make it not happen.

642
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,400
[Corey] You did everything--

643
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:10,800
And I go over it and over it
and over it, like a loop in my mind.

644
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:15,300
[Corey] Because this is so,
so, so close to your heart,

645
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:16,966
you're never gonna think clear.

646
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:19,533
And I think I should just take
that off of your chest

647
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,366
really help you with the security thing.

648
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:25,300
I swear to you, I know how important
your kids are,

649
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:28,200
and I know how important you are to me,
and I'm gonna always treat

650
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:31,466
your kids and protect them
just like I would protect you.

651
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:36,500
You're never gonna think
nobody's good enough to help you

652
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,366
protect your kids better than you,

653
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,300
but we have to put the
right people in place,

654
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:44,733
we got to interview people, and I just
want to help you deal with that situation.

655
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,700
I'm here for you, and you know it.
So just think about it.

656
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:49,100
[Kris] Okay.

657
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,233
Thank you. Appreciate it.

658
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,866
♪ ♪

659
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,433
[Caitlyn] Kendall! Where are you?

660
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:10,200
What the heck are you doing out here?

661
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:13,066
-[Kendall] Hanging out.
-[Caitlyn] Hanging out? Enjoying the sun?

662
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,033
[Kendall] Yeah.

663
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,066
[Caitlyn] It's beautiful up here.

664
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:17,933
What a great view.

665
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,400
[Kendall] It's better at night, too.

666
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:22,633
[Caitlyn] Well, how are things?
Do you like your new car?

667
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,033
[Kendall] I love my new car.

668
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,566
[Caitlyn] Maybe I should come over
and borrow the car

669
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:28,800
-and put some miles on it.
-[Kendall] No.

670
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,733
[Caitlyn] You know I'll be good to it.

671
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,066
[Kendall] Mm...

672
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:34,300
[Caitlyn] So how are you doing
with the whole Kim thing?

673
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,400
[Kendall] I'm okay.
It's just all really crazy.

674
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:39,500
-[Caitlyn] Did you testify the other day?
-[Kendall] Yeah.

675
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:41,900
-[Caitlyn] How did that go?
-[Kendall] It was good, I guess.

676
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:43,800
-I don't know.
-[Caitlyn] Was the guy there?

677
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:44,900
[Kendall] Yeah.

678
00:32:44,966 --> 00:32:46,100
[Caitlyn] Oh, get out.

679
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:49,500
[Kendall] Yeah. It was one of the most
uncomfortable things I've ever done, like,

680
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:50,866
in my life.

681
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:53,033
[Caitlyn] Sorry you had
to go through that stuff.

682
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,533
[Kendall] Thanks, Dad.

683
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,733
[Caitlyn] He was probably excited
that you had to come

684
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,166
all the way down there because of him.

685
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:00,333
[Kendall] No.

686
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,200
Like, I hate that someone said
online... someone, like, wrote,

687
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:05,666
like, "Kendall has an obsessed fan."

688
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:07,766
I wouldn't... 'Cause a fan, like...

689
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:09,533
[Caitlyn] Yeah, wants an autograph...

690
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,533
[Kendall] Loves you, wants an
autograph, a picture.

691
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,200
He's just, like, obsessed.

692
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,066
[Caitlyn] Obsessive person, yeah.

693
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:16,933
[Kendall] He wasn't like,
"Oh my God, Kendall!"

694
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,800
He was like this the whole time.

695
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:19,966
[Caitlyn] Was he, really?

696
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:22,433
[Kendall] Like, we didn't make
eye contact once. It's sad.

697
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,700
Like, I was on the verge of tears
the whole time because I felt bad for him.

698
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:29,900
Even though it's, like,
necessary right now.

699
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,766
It's just, like... makes me sad.

700
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,400
[Caitlyn] No, I totally agree.

701
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:36,533
-[Kendall] He's been through...
-[Caitlyn] It's sad,

702
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,733
that somebody would go to that extent
and what they did.

703
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,133
[Kendall] Yeah, it's scary,
and it's definitely necessary

704
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,866
to, like, protect myself,
'cause I don't know

705
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:45,933
what anyone is capable of doing.

706
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,300
[Kendall] My day in court was
really intense.

707
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:52,500
I was really nervous.
I've never done that before.

708
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:54,166
And I never want to have to do it again.

709
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:58,966
But I'm realizing now that,
regardless of his mental health,

710
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:02,800
that we, as a family, have to
take action and have to protect ourselves.

711
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:06,066
But I really do hope that he gets
the help that he needs.

712
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:09,166
[Caitlyn] I can't believe between Kim,
that guy,

713
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:10,866
all these crazies are coming out.

714
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:13,033
[Kendall] It's crazy.
what's happening in the universe.

715
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,833
[Caitlyn] Well, nobody's after me.

716
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,600
-So far so good.
-[Kendall] I might have to go inside.

717
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:22,066
-[Caitlyn] Why?
-[Kendall] 'Cause I'm sweating.

718
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:25,300
[Caitlyn] We wouldn't want you to sweat.
Let's go inside.

719
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:34,133
{\an8}[Kris] Did you ever get your
passport renewed?

720
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,833
[Corey] I'll do it this week.

721
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,033
[Kris] All right.

722
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,133
[Corey] Do you want to go
to the range with me?

723
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,033
-[Kris] No.
-[Corey] But why?

724
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,866
[Kris] I don't want to shoot a gun.

725
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:45,266
You'll be sitting right there,
and you can shoot the gun.

726
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,933
[Corey] Once you stop acting
like a wuss puss, I'm gonna show you.

727
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,333
-[Kris] A wuss puss?
-[Corey] That's like a punk and a pussy.

728
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:57,733
[Kris] Did you get the memo
from Kendall about Victoria's Secret?

729
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,466
[Corey] I'm already organizing it,
so I just got to get her that second guy.

730
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,833
[Kris] Well, because this is
her first time back in Paris.

731
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,266
-[Corey] Ever since everything.
-[Kris] Since the incident.

732
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:13,300
She needs to know that if she's sleeping,
there's somebody right outside her door

733
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:15,266
-so she feels safe.
-[Corey] Oh, I'm on it.

734
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,900
I plan on having that little formula
around her all the time.

735
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:22,733
[Kris] Sometimes I'm too emotional
because I'm so attached,

736
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,600
so Corey's been really instrumental
in helping me identify the security teams.

737
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:31,666
[Corey] I just want to ask you, like,
some general questions

738
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:36,433
about before you go putting somebody
around your girls.

739
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,466
[Kris] I need to really lean
on someone else from time to time

740
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:42,633
so I can think clearly.

741
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:44,966
Thank God you're in charge.

742
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:47,800
To have you help me with this
means everything.

743
00:35:47,866 --> 00:35:48,933
It really does.

744
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,366
[Corey] Anything that's bothering you,
or you feel like you want it better,

745
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:56,700
but you can't give it all the energy
because you're so spread out?

746
00:35:56,766 --> 00:35:58,166
-[Kris] Yes.
-[Corey] I want to help.

747
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,866
Teamwork is everything.

748
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,300
[Kris] Yeah. Teamwork is everything.

749
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,200
-[Corey] I got you.
-[Kris] Well, I appreciate it.

750
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:11,200
It's nice to have a partner in crime.

751
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:13,566
-[Corey] I definitely want to be--
-[Kris] No pun intended.

752
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:15,733
[Corey] Your partner in crime.

753
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,900
-I love you.
-[Kris] Love you, too.

754
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:33,700
[Kris] Do two of these with guac,
and then, um, put chips out,

755
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:36,966
so... 'cause I think people
will be here shortly.

756
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:38,833
[man] Okay.
-[Kris] Oh, (bleep), I should've...

757
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,633
-[Kylie] I'm glad I got the comfy memo.
-[Kris] The memo.

758
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,833
[Kylie] I would've worn the same thing.

759
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,233
[Kris] I know, but you look so cute.

760
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,733
-[Kylie] Is everyone really comfy?
-[Kris] I don't know.

761
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,066
Wait till she gets here,
and then you can always change.

762
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:52,666
Build your own taco salad?

763
00:36:52,733 --> 00:36:55,166
[Kylie] Am I the first one?
I'm like the best daughter.

764
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:57,100
-[Kris] Yes, you are.
-[Kylie] No, I really am.

765
00:36:57,166 --> 00:37:00,566
[Kris] I know.
Don't tell anybody else, though.

766
00:37:01,433 --> 00:37:03,466
Look at the cake I ordered.
Isn't it pretty?

767
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,133
[Kylie] Mm-hmm. It's cool.

768
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,300
[Kris] Today's Kim's birthday,
so we decided to surprise her,

769
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:12,466
and Kanye has her out
while we all gather at her house.

770
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:15,700
I know that Kim said
that she doesn't want to do anything

771
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:16,966
for her birthday, but I know

772
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:19,933
the incident in Paris could've gone
from bad to worse.

773
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,400
We're so glad we have her,
and we really want to celebrate her

774
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:26,533
now more than ever.

775
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:28,466
-[Kylie] Hey, Mase!
-[Kendall] Hey.

776
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:29,733
[Kylie] Me first! Me first!

777
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,933
[Kylie and Kendall] Me first,
me first, me first, me first!

778
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,800
-[Kendall] Me first!
-[Kylie] Me, me, me, me!

779
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:35,833
[Kylie and Kendall] Oh!

780
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,066
[Kylie] Corey first?

781
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,400
Hi, Bob!

782
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,600
{\an8}[Allison] Hi, everyone. Hi, Ky!
-[Kylie] What's up?

783
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,600
{\an8}-[Allison] How are you? Mwah.
-[Kylie] Kourtney!

784
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:45,200
-[Kourtney] Who wants to take Reign?
-[Kylie] Me, me, me. No. Me.

785
00:37:45,266 --> 00:37:46,666
[Kris] Hi, everybody.

786
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:50,633
[Penelope] Why is KiKi not here,
even when they live here?

787
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,666
[Kourtney] Because we will surprise her.

788
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:54,266
She doesn't know that we're here.

789
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,700
[Kris] They'll come in 10 minutes.

790
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:57,700
[Kylie] Wait. Should we go outside now?

791
00:37:57,766 --> 00:38:00,400
[Kendall] We should go outside.
You guys, we're gonna go out front.

792
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:03,433
-She's five minutes -away.
-[Kylie] Come on, guys.

793
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,300
[Kris] We just didn't think it
was a good idea to jump out

794
00:38:06,366 --> 00:38:08,300
and yell "surprise" when she walks
in the door,

795
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:11,433
because that would probably
really scare Kim,

796
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,933
so we all decided to wait outside
in the driveway.

797
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,733
[Kendall] Come on, guys. Come here.
They're about to get here,

798
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,833
and when they get here,
we all say "Surprise!"

799
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,800
-[Kris] North, here she comes!
-[Corey] Here she comes. She's pulling up.

800
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,900
-[Kourtney] Is that her?
-[Kris] Three, two, one.

801
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,933
[Kris] North, here she comes!

802
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,266
{\an8}-[Corey] Here she comes. She's pulling up.
-[Kourtney] North, is that her?

803
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,833
[Kris] Three, two, one.

804
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,800
-[Kylie] Oh, there they are.
-[all] Surprise!

809
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,433
[Scott] Give her a hug, Mase.

810
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,133
Give her a hug!

811
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,633
[Kim] I am totally surprised.
I... I never get surprised.

812
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,166
I always know what's going on.

813
00:38:56,233 --> 00:39:00,200
I think it was maybe good for me
to see even my brother show up,

814
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:05,166
all my best friends show up at the house
where I feel comfortable,

815
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:07,733
with lots of security. It's all I want.

816
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,766
If anyone wants to know what to get me
for a present, just security.

817
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,366
Wait. I want to take a pic of this.

818
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,566
Okay, wait.
Get out of it, Rob, for one sec.

819
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:18,233
[Kris] Let's eat!

820
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,833
[Corey] I got something to ask you.

821
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:24,066
Hey, security's here to follow you home.

822
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:26,066
-You cool with that?
-[Kylie] Sure.

823
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,066
-[Corey] All right.
-[Kylie] Thank you.

824
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,900
[Kendall] Kim, do you want to open
me and Kylie's first?

825
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:33,266
-I have to leave.
-[Kim] Yeah.

826
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:36,366
-[Kourtney] Which one?
-[Kendall] Come. She's gonna open it.

827
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:39,466

-[Kris] Let me see.

831
00:39:48,066 --> 00:39:50,066
[Kim] It says "Saint."
It's the necklace that...

832
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:51,500
I lost.

833
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:54,800
