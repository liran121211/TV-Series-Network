-Some people are just capable...
-[Rob] She's wired differently than me.

163
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,533
Some people aren't.

164
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,299
Mom, you have no idea
about anything. You...

165
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:40,633
-Okay.
-[Rob] You say just what you think.

166
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,966
I don't give up
just that easy on somebody.

167
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:46,600
We do have a baby,
and my goal is to have a family.

168
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,333
For that family be together
That's what I want.

169
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,333
[Kourtney] I respect you for that.
That's what makes you a good person.

170
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,500
[Kris] Rob has
the most amazing family values.

171
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:03,566
And I really admire his devotion
to his baby and to the family

172
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,766
that he wishes he had,
so my heart goes out to him.

173
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,866
If there wasn't a baby,
if we didn't have Dream,

174
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:13,000
I wouldn't even be even trying anything.

175
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,100
-[Kris] Yeah.
-[Rob] Trust me.

176
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,633
[Kourtney] You ready to hit the road?

177
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,800
We really have tried
to make this trip paparazzi-free.

178
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:37,433
We've left the house
in these unmarked cars,

179
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,200
and we've really taken measures
to get out and just have a fun day.

180
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:47,633
It's good to have alone sister time
without any distractions.

181
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,966
It's just us.

182
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,133
Kourtney, you might be
the worst driver I've ever met.

183
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,900
Kourtney is a horrible driver.

184
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm gonna throw up on you.

185
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,033
Well, making 100 U-turns and stuff...

186
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,566
-Horrible.
-Horrible. She makes you carsick.

187
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:07,166
-Yeah.
-'Cause she's so jerky with the car.

188
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:10,866
The fact that she thinks
she's actually good blows my mind.

189
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,766
Why do you stop so fast?

190
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:16,066
-I think you're a good driver.
-I know I'm a good driver.

191
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,666
Yeah, you got us out
of that Montana situation.

192
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,566
-Whoa, we're sliding. Khloe! Khloe!
-It's not my fault, not my fault!

193
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,233
-Oh, my God!
-I don't have my seat belt on!

194
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,933
Holy [bleep]! Holy [bleep]!

195
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:32,133
And I'll never forget it.
Forever indebted.

196
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,966
[Khloe laughs] Yeah.

197
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,500
[dance music plays]

198
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,833
Has anybody ever
stopped at the dinosaurs before?

199
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,566
-[Khloe and Kim] I haven't.
-[Kourtney] Me, neither.

200
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:50,033
I feel every time
we would drive, we would say,

201
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,733
"One time,
we got to stop at the dinosaurs."

202
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
[Kim] We definitely did.

203
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:59,900
Every year, when we drove to Palm Springs,
we would always pass the dinosaurs

204
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:03,366
on the side of the freeway,
and we were never allowed to stop.

205
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:07,666
{\an8}[Kris] <i>I see the dinos.</i>
<i>There's the dinos. See the dinosaurs?</i>

206
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,733
{\an8}[Robert] <i>Yeah</i>.

207
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:12,500
We finally are going to see the dinosaurs!

208
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,233
-For the first time ever.
-Yes, in our whole lives.

209
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,833
[Kourtney] Remember
Pee-wee does the dishes?

210
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,233
-[Khloe] Yeah.
-[Kourtney] And Large Marge?

211
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,266
[Kim] The dinosaurs are
from the Pee-wee movie.

212
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,900
Kourtney and I used to do
the Large Marge monologue all the time.

213
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:30,900
{\an8}[Kourtney] <i>Okay, she's Pee-wee,</i>
<i>okay, and I'm Large Marge.</i>

214
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:32,800
{\an8}[Kim] <i>100 years ago...</i>

215
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:36,133
{\an8}[Kourtney] <i>There was</i>
<i>the biggest accident I've ever seen.</i>

216
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,933
{\an8}[Kim] <i>It looked like the...</i>

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,466
{\an8}[both making silly noises]

218
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,000
[Kourtney] Which shall
we take a photo in front of?

219
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:46,600
[Khloe] I want to get the whole thing. Oh.

220
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:51,233
-[Khloe] Kim, it's soft!
-[Kim] It is?

221
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,800
-[Khloe] It's squishy.
-[Kim] I want one for the backyard.

222
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:57,066
[Kourtney] "Mr. Rex's Dinosaur Adventure."

223
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,466
"If there was ever a California
roadside attraction, this is it."

224
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:05,466
-I need a photo like this. One...
-[all] Two, three.

225
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:09,366
[Kourtney] We're such geeks. I love it.

226
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:20,333
{\an8}[Rob] I think it'd be
a good idea if I redid

227
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,166
every single one of these magazines
and did the same exact shoots,

228
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,333
just with me in it, and did everyone.

229
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,033
Not just Photoshop my face,
but actually do it.

230
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
You're crazy.

231
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:35,233
Remember I told you I met
that artist in Cannes named Abdullah?

232
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,533
Yeah, totally, Mom.

233
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,433
Anyway, he came by here
to drop off some more art

234
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,000
when he was here from Dubai
and he brought his life coach with him

235
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,866
and his name is Jamel.

236
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,833
Would you meet somebody like that?

237
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,966
I just don't need, like,
a babysitter, that's all.

238
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:58,000
I'd love you to meet him.
Everything happens...

239
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,800
[both] For a reason.

240
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:00,966
-I do.
-[Rob] I agree.

241
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:04,200
[Kris] Isn't it strange
that the person I met in Cannes

242
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:07,566
is suddenly in my living room,
and he brought this guy?

243
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:10,466
I thought this would be
such a great match for Rob.

244
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,666
I mean, I'm always open to new things.

245
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:19,166
-You are?
-Well, maybe not in the past, but now.

246
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,833
I definitely need
to change how I do things.

247
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,966
it obviously hasn't been working.

248
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,333
I'm so happy that Rob
is into meeting Jamel,

249
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,066
because he might be a wonderful person

250
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:34,300
in Rob's life to be
an inspiration and a light

251
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,066
and somebody Rob could talk to.

252
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,700
Well, I'm proud of you, Rob,
and I'm really, really happy

253
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:42,700
that you are willing to meet him
and try something new.

254
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:45,133
-Makes me happy, too.
-We're both happy.

255
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,800
-I'm so happy.
-Happy.

256
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:58,333
When we go shopping,
we don't want to go to random stores.

257
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,866
Wouldn't you guys
rather go to a furniture store?

258
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:04,300
-Or, like, a vintage clothing store?
-Yeah.

259
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:07,866
-I don't care to shop at all.
-But I'm saying, like, vintage.

260
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,700
-[Khloe] This is the Parker.
-This is cute.

261
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:13,266
[Khloe] So vintage. "Vin-taj."

262
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,200
-[Kourtney] Yeah, this hotel's good.
-[man] Welcome to The Parker.

263
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,600
[Khloe] I feel
we should be Mom with a martini.

264
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,533
[Kim] Oh, look at this. Khlo.

265
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,866
[Khloe chuckles] Oh, that's casual.

266
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:28,700
Is that a banana in your pocket,
or are you just happy to see me?

267
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:30,633
Six-foot banana.

268
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,333
Kourtney...

269
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:37,600
No. Pull it out like a normal person.

270
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,166
Kourtney, really?

271
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:46,566
Kourtney concerns me in life.
You have three kids. There you go.

272
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:47,866
Oh, Lord.

273
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,200
-[Khloe] This is definitely modern.
-[Kourtney] I love it.

274
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,500
[Kim] This is the African room.

275
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:59,066
I'm staying in the other room.
Kim doesn't want to sleep alone.

276
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:03,100
I sleep with people every night.
I'm happy to sleep alone.

277
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,100
Sleep alone.
Kim and I will sleep together.

278
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,733
[Kourtney] You don't have
to convince me twice.

279
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
[Khloe] Okay, can you guys
tell me this stupid plan?

280
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:16,500
-You want to go shopping?
-[Kourtney] We are gonna change right now.

281
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:19,666
And do what?
Drive around to a vintage store?

282
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,666
Mm-hmm. We're gonna just hit the road.

283
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:25,000
Adventure time. Mario time.

284
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:29,333
Yay! love vintage shopping

285
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,866
and smelling old clothes.

286
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,933
I'm not really a changer,
but I'll change for you.

287
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
If anyone wants to know
what I'm wearing right now, it's this.

288
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,266
All right?

289
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,566
-[Khloe] That's what you're wearing, Nana?
-[Kourtney] Yes.

290
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,233
Whoa.

291
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,933
[upbeat, electronic music plays]

292
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,133
{\an8}-[Kris] Hi!
-[Jamel] How are you?

293
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,100
-[Kris] Good. You?
-Good to see you again.

294
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,633
-[Kris] You, too.
-Excellent.

295
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,900
Thanks for coming. Rob, this is Jamel.

296
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,833
-[Rob] Oh, my God.
-What's up, bud?

297
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,000
-Jamel, this is my son Rob.
-How are you, my friend? Jamel.

298
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,366
-Pleasure to meet you.
-[Rob] You, too.

299
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:15,266
I want Jamel
to tell you a bit about what he does.

300
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,933
I'm not one to talk about myself too much.

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,133
I've been a life coach for 20 years.

302
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,466
I'll end up being one of your homies
that will play ball with you,

303
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:27,566
exercise with you,
go eat with you, then listen to you.

304
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,500
And I'll be one of your friends

305
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:32,733
who will give you functional feedback
that would actually work.

306
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,866
-[Rob] I'm down with it.
-What things will you want to discuss?

307
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,333
Some of the challenges
you're presented with now?

308
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,966
Um, I just feel like
I've been kind of stuck

309
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:47,766
and not really motivated,
because things going on in my life,

310
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,200
my relationship.

311
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:52,266
I don't want that
to, like, derail me and--

312
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:56,200
'Cause I'm very overweight
compared to what I'm used to.

313
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,933
I haven't been able to break the cycle.

314
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:03,566
My favorite saying is you
become the author of your life.

315
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:08,800
If you don't like the way it's going,
stop and take reconsideration.

316
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,233
You write it differently.

317
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,266
It can sometimes be uncomfortable
to meet somebody new.

318
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:18,733
But Rob seems relaxed
and he can maybe be receptive

319
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,533
to what Jamel has to say.

320
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,933
I think that this is just the next step
in the whole healing process.

321
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,300
My skill set has always been listening.

322
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:30,400
Today, I have on this tight jacket.

323
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,233
Normally I'm chill like you, but
but of respect for your mom, I had to...

324
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,733
-My mom's a blazer person, too.
-Got to love a good blazer.

325
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,000
-You got to.
-[Jamel] That's really it.

326
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:41,966
I think I'm down to meet and talk.

327
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:44,633
I like to break bread
over a game of Madden.

328
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,900
-[chuckles] Okay.
-[Jamel] Are you good at it?

329
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,600
-[Rob] Very good. Top 400 in the world.
-[Kris laughs]

330
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:54,633
-[Jamel] Now you're throwing numbers?
-[Kris] This could be a bromance. Perfect.

331
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
[Jamel laughs]

332
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:04,966
{\an8}[Khloe] Can I take a picture
of both your asses?

333
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,066
[Kourtney] Mine especially in these.

334
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,200
[Khloe] So you can see
what we're working with.

335
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:12,566
-[Kourtney laughs]
-Pancake and a double-double.

336
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,433
Kourtney has a good ass,
but these shorts make her look like Nana.

337
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,966
-[Kourtney] Should I go like this?
-[Khloe] Yeah.

338
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,866
-It makes you look like Nana.
-[Kourtney] How's that?

339
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,933
[Khloe] Way better. You have a good ass.

340
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,866
[Kourtney] Khloe, I know.
That's why I'm not concerned.

341
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:28,633
[Khloe] Oh, this is such a pretty car!

342
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,000
Our grandparents used
to drive us around in Cadillacs,

343
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:36,833
so I thought it was fun
to rent us a Chevy Bel Air.

344
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,100
-Damn...
-Damn, Gina.

345
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,400
Never heard of it,
but thought it was cute.

346
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:47,666
-We're all sitting in here?
-You're in heels. Shall Khloe drive?

347
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:50,533
-Kourt, can you drive this?
-I drive the Thunderbird.

348
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,433
Are you a bit nervous?

349
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:56,333
-How do I put it into drive though?
-[Khloe] Oh, my God.

350
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,700
-Oh, yeah, I see it.
-[Khloe] That's the gear.

351
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,400
Oh, [bleep].

352
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,833
-Did we sign a waiver?
-[Kourtney] Does this have seatbelts?

353
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,766
[bleep] no!
It doesn't even have a right mirror.

354
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,300
-[Khloe] Kourtney...
-[Kourtney] Seriously. You can't stop it.

355
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:18,033
It takes five minutes to stop.

356
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,633
-Kourtney's working her arms.
-[they laugh]

357
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:27,133
[Kourtney] Ooh, whew!
Guys, it's like a boat.

358
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,100
He was like, "Are you doing
anything for their birthday?"

359
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,633
-I was like, "They're going out of town."
-Get off the phone!

360
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,566
-Oh, my God.
-[camera shutter clicks]

361
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:38,433
[Kourtney] I feel like this is all
near the car dealerships, on the left.

362
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,433
[Kim] Yeah, it's so wild.

363
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Ooh. [engine clanking]

364
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,300
-What?
-Oh, [bleep].

365
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:48,233
-The car died. It says the oil.
-The car broke down.

366
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,600
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Our car just broke down. I'll call back.

367
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,233
-[horn honks]
-Oh, shut up, you [bleep] loser!

368
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,233
-The car just broke down.
-[engine sputtering]

369
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,733
-[engine revs]
-[Khloe] Okay, you moron!

370
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,133
Stop holding the ignition like that.
You're gonna flood it.

371
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,200
-Put your [bleep] hazards on.
-Spring break.

372
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:09,833
-[they laugh]
-Spring break, 2017.

373
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,033
-It says "oil."
-[Khloe] Put it in park. Oh, my God.

374
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,900
-[horn honks]
-It won't go in park!

375
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:17,366
-You [bleep].
-Oh, my gosh.

376
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,400
-It won't go in park.
-Okay, what are we gonna do?

377
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:23,400
You can't put it... Push the ga...

378
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:25,800
-Shall I push the car?
-You gotta pump it.

379
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:28,500
-What do you want us to do?
-[Khloe screams, laughs]

380
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:30,566
-[Khloe] Put it in neutral!
-[Kourtney] It is!

381
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:33,266
[Kim] I see all this oil leaking.
I think something's wrong.

382
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,233
-[Khloe] Put it in neutral, you moron.
-It is!

383
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,000
-[Khloe] Put it in neutral! [laughs]
-[Kourtney] It is!

384
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,400
[Kim] Okay!

385
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm afraid that now if people will see us

386
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:45,566
they'll take pics,
and then the paparazzi will know

387
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:49,333
we're in Palm Springs
and they're all gonna come here.

388
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,466
Like, our private time is gonna be ruined.

389
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,366
[Khloe] Ooh!

390
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:55,233
[horns honking]

391
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,133
-[Khloe] Oh, shut up! Argh!
-[they laugh]

392
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,133
[horns honking]

393
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,000
[Khloe] Oh, shut up! Argh!

394
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:12,966
We get this super gorgeous
throwback car, and it breaks down...

395
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,100
[Khloe] Ooh!

396
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,433
...on, like, the busiest street
in Palm Springs.

397
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,833
[horn honks]

398
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,533
-Appreciate it!
-Okay, stop, stop.

399
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,966
[Khloe] You weren't
doing anything. It was all me.

400
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,166
It's a highway. Don't know what street.

401
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:29,833
-Turn the car off.
-Khloe, I know how to drive these cars!

402
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,200
-[Khloe] You don't know!
-More than you do!

403
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:33,366
[horn honks]

404
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:36,733
It's mortifying.
Everyone's honking. It's just horrible.

405
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,166
[engine sputtering]

406
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:40,933
You have to run the gas
and not flood the engine.

407
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,933
-Let's give it a whirl.
-It said "oil."

408
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,933
There's no seatbelts.
I don't know if I feel safe.

409
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,500
[Khloe] You're fine.

410
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,900
Kourtney, you're gonna hit the van!

411
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:55,033
No, you're not.
Let's go. This guy's waiting for you.

412
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,566
-[bleep].
-They'll get in front of you!

413
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:01,700
-[laughter]
-[horn honking]

414
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:05,233
-Welcome to good old Palm Springs.
-Palm Springs!

415
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:16,833
{\an8}[Faye] Kris? Hi there.
-[Kris] Look at you! Hi, honey!

416
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,700
{\an8}-Let's go sit over here.
-[Faye] It looks great in here.

417
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:21,900
-Are you so happy with it?
-[Kris] Yes.

418
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:26,433
Do you realize you and I have
had the same hairstyle for 30 years?

419
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,900
Uh, yeah.

420
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:31,533
No, but you did get edgier,
which was cool. I mean, back in the '80s.

421
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,333
-Had my little bangs and my bowl cut.
-[Faye] It was so cool.

422
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,966
I literally left a client
in mid-sentence, by the way,

423
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:41,966
because you said to come over,
you had something fun.

424
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:45,166
-You are going to die. To die.
-Why?

425
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:50,566
I got a letter from
what appeared to be a royal family.

426
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:53,366
And I didn't really believe it at first.

427
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:57,166
And so I had these people
checked out, and they're for real.

428
00:22:57,233 --> 00:23:02,066
Basically, the letter
is requesting the ability

429
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:05,333
to purchase one of my eggs.

430
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,666
-[Faye] Okay, now, that's weird.
-[Kris laughs]

431
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,266
You must get the craziest requests.

432
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,700
-This one tops everything.
-It's quite a compliment.

433
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:17,700
In particular, somebody
wants to buy my DNA, basically.

434
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:19,800
-[Faye] I love this.
-Isn't this wild?

435
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,600
"He and his wife believe
an offspring with your DNA

436
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,233
will fit seamlessly
into their royal lineage."

437
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,166
-Okay, this is crazy.
-Royal lineage!

438
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:28,866
That is the wildest thing.

439
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,633
Didn't Kim freeze some eggs? [laughs]

440
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,433
Just kidding.

441
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,900
[Kris] What?

442
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:37,633
-She would never do that.
-[Faye] No, she wouldn't.

443
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,033
And I know you wouldn't either.
But it's funny.

444
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,666
Well, don't count me out yet.

445
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:45,000
Janet Jackson just had a baby.

446
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:50,533
If she's mid-50s,
that's like a six-year age gap.

447
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,800
-That's not inconceivable.
-So are you gonna respond to them?

448
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:58,100
-What are you gonna say?
-I think I'm gonna see if I can...

449
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:01,033
-Feel it out.
-Yeah.

450
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:05,333
You're just such a curious kitty.
You have to go down that road.

451
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,533
Imagine if I had a child
that grew up in a castle in Europe

452
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,766
and that was royalty?

453
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:15,166
We could design a crest.
-[both laughing]

454
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:19,066
[rhythmic dance electronic music plays]

455
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,166
[Kim] This is cool. Vintage glasses.
You should try some.

456
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,633
Those would be cute on you.

457
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,333
[Khloe] The monkey is holding the lights.

458
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,766
Oh, my God, they're so creepy
and cute at the same time.

459
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,033
It's, like, hanging from the ceiling.

460
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,400
Does anyone think
this monkey's so cute? It's so cute.

461
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,066
They really walked away.

462
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,300
Okay. I'll just keep talking to myself.

463
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:59,333
My sisters walk away from me
when I'm talking, 24/7.

464
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:03,000
-Do you think I should get this thing?
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

465
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:06,200
[Khloe] Nobody seems to care.
Just like, "Okay."

466
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:09,033
I don't know
if that means I talk too much.

467
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,866
Or I'm not talking about the right things.
I'm trying to figure that out.

468
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:15,700
Me and Cornelius will hang out.

469
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:17,366
Cornelius?

470
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,433
[in sing-songy voice] Cornelius? Corn?

471
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,133
[Khloe] <i>Cornelius</i>
<i>is my brother's imaginary friend.</i>

472
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,000
-Cornelius?
-[phone ringing]

473
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:31,033
-[Rob on phone] <i>Hello?</i>
-Rob, in Palm Springs.

474
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,300
{\an8}Cornelius came by.

475
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,633
-[Rob]<i> Really?</i>
-[Khloe] Yeah. Isn't that crazy?

476
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,100
[Rob] <i>That's so interesting.</i>

477
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,766
Cornelius, should we buy this for Rob?

478
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,600
It's 695.

479
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:47,433
Do you want to buy Rob that painting?
You know him better than I do.

480
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,833
{\an8}How often do you see Corn?

481
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,533
[Rob] <i>I don't see him as much anymore.</i>
<i>I'm not real comfortable talking to him.</i>

482
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,566
[Khloe] <i>He was helping me</i>
<i>with stuff for your birthday.</i>

483
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,500
[Rob] <i>I know, but his wife died.</i>

484
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:04,600
[Khloe] What?

485
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:07,866
Cornelius, why didn't you tell
me your wife [bleep] died?

486
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh.

487
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,033
Guess what? Cornelius is with me.

488
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,066
I don't need you guys.

-[Jamel] It's good to see you. He is.

{\an8}-What's good?
-[Jamel] How are you, bro? In the zone?

492
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:37,366
[Rob] Just doing a warm-up.

493
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:40,133
I feel good about your workout.
And that I get to watch it.

494
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,866
-[Rob laughs]
-[Jamel] Yep.

495
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,000
-I feel good, too.
-Are you gonna say:

496
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:46,266
"Mel, it seems your strategy is working?"

497
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:49,100
-[chuckles] We'll wait it out.
-[Jamel] Fair enough.

498
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:50,500
I trust the process.

499
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:54,533
That's a profound statement
you said: "I trust the process."

500
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,966
-[Rob] Yeah.
-I don't know if you know what you said.

501
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:01,033
-That's pretty dope right there, bro.
-Of course. Trust the process.

502
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,766
I know my mom wants
to encourage me just to be happy

503
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:09,700
and in a good place and taking charge
of your life means being productive.

504
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:12,966
One day, you'll be a champ.
You'll be good one day, kid.

505
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:17,166
[Rob] Still a lot of work, but I'm
at least in a way better headspace.

506
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:20,633
I'm getting to a place
where I feel good about myself.

507
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,500
I'm just excited
to turn over this new leaf.

508
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:24,733
It means a lot to me.

509
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:27,400
[Jamel] You got that done with ease.

510
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:29,700
-There's no place I'd rather be.

I thought we were gonna hang out together.

[Kim] That's what people do
in Palm Springs. Go to bed early.

You don't want to hang out?

518

[Kim] I mean, I'm hanging out right here.

519
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:13,166
I think in my sisters' old age,
they need a reminder in how to have fun.

520
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,566
Obviously, Khlo Money
has to bring the party.

521
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:17,600
I do have a reputation to uphold.

Married to Jessica Simpson!

-[Kim] Nick Lachey.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

This isn't really the most

Shall we drink champagne and dance?

547

Kim and Kourt, I think the thing
that I want you two to always remember

548
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:26,800
is, yeah, we're sisters,
but I choose to be,

549
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,666
like, best friends with you guys.

550
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,466
I think we have
the best relationship in the world,

551
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:33,366
and I just want to keep that going.

552
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:37,700
And sometimes I get sad
when I see us having our own lives,

553
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:40,400
'cause it just makes me realize
we're growing up.

554
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:43,933
But I'm thankful
of every minute we have together.

555
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,766
I just never want that to end.
And I love you guys.

-She's gonna feed you. Sorry.

566
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:29,600
It's my only child, my first child,
so I want to see her every day.

567
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:33,300
I want to interact with her
and just have her recognize me.

568
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:35,500
That was my plan. And I even told Chyna:

569
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:38,266
"I won't make your life difficult.
I won't be like:

570
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,500
"I need the babies on this day.'"
I'm going with the flow.

571
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,266
Whatever she wants, I'm agreeing with her.

572
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:49,133
That's the part right there,
I want to kind of work with a bit.

573
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,666
That's not what she wants.

574
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:55,033
You're saying is, "Chyna, whatever
you want is okay, because I want peace."

575
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,933
She doesn't hear that. She hears:
"Rob doesn't know what he wants.

576
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,300
He's not choosing a day.
I wish he would make a decision."

577
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:04,200
I want to encourage you to have voice.

578
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:07,366
I want you to have the same
commanding presence your dad had.

579
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,066
I know it's in you.

580
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,966
This is the time to start
to erect Rob's voice

581
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:14,466
and take charge of Rob's life.

582
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:19,066
[upbeat music plays]

583
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:22,666
{\an8}[Jamel] You built your foundation
on attraction and sex.

584
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:24,900
-[Rob] Yeah.
-[Jamel] Pathway to Paradise.

585
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,033
Now, when the lust
started to simmer down a little

586
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,833
and this miraculous child came,
you was like, "Crap, what do we do now?"

587
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,566
Let me ask you:
How did you get there before?

588
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:36,966
We're gonna call it "Pathway to Paradise."

589
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:40,733
-[Rob] It just happened every day.
-Nothing just happens.

590
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,033
[Rob] We were happy in the house.

591
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,766
We were chilling with her family,
just her cooking for me.

592
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,500
-Okay.
-[Rob] Random movies or just talks.

593
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:52,066
-Listening to music, talking.
-[Jamel] Intimate time?

594
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:53,466
Okay.

595
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:57,333
My question would be:

596
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,233
If this was the Pathway to Paradise,

597
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,433
do you see this happening at all now?

598
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:05,300
-[Rob] Oh, no.
-None of it.

599
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:07,533
-[Rob] None of that.
-[Jamel] Got it.

600
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:11,100
If this is the vehicle you used
on this path to paradise

601
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:14,766
and this vehicle has broken down,
it's abandoned on the side of the road.

602
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,833
Your job is to figure out
how to repair this vehicle.

603
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:22,466
But you're still in the car,
trying to start the engine, put gas in it.

604
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:24,766
Now you're walking
to the Pathway to Paradise.

605
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,533
You know what happens
when you aimlessly wander in a desert?

606
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,000
You become delusional, Rob.

607
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,866
So thinking that Chyna's
gonna show up on your birthday

608
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:37,666
with lingerie underneath, with all
these things not being in the equation

609
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:41,433
sounds like you're dehydrated to me
and becoming a little delusional.

610
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,100
-You know the slang for dehydration is?
-I'm hydrated.

611
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,633
[Jamel] Thirsty.

612
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:49,200
We're trying to figure out
what's real and what's not.

613
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:52,033
Whenever you get through that,
you can see more clearly.

614
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,466
Is this supposed to be your wife?
The person you spend your life with?

615
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:59,500
Then you'll be able to decide
without having any regrets,

616
00:32:59,566 --> 00:33:03,333
because it'll be very clear,
for not just you, but for her as well.

617
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,933
Obviously, I love
my family being all together.

618
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,333
But I really don't know what to do.

619
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,433
I've been working on trying to save my
relationship with Chyna for a long time.

620
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,200
But, at this point, it's too much.

621
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,066
[Jamel] That's life.

622
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:32,966
[Kourtney] Don't leave without me.

623
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:37,033
We're gonna give
this old-school car one more shot.

624
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,333
to go to Nana and Papa's house.

625
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,366
I'm hoping as Kourtney isn't driving,

626
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:43,600
maybe it's not gonna break down this time.

627
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:47,366
There's no mirror? Nope.
No mirrors anywhere in here.

628
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,266
'Cause they weren't as vain then.

629
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,566

the door and actually lets us in?

a good vibe. This is a good, nice life.

00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:34,400
{\an8}-This is so cute.
-[Kim] Yeah, we've got to take a pic.

641
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,300
-Kourtney would love it...
-I'll bring my real camera.

642
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:41,400
That'll be even cooler.

643
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:45,433
-[Khloe] Hello.
-[Andrea] Hello! How are you?

644
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,266
-[Khloe] Good.
-Long time no see! You look fabulous.

645
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,400
-[Khloe] I do? Thanks.
-[Andrea] Yes! You look so great!

646
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:52,600
[Kourtney] Hi. Hi.

647
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:56,800
-[Andrea] Hi. How are you guys?
-[Kourtney] Good. How are you?

648
00:34:56,866 --> 00:35:00,166
-I need a picture of the snapdragons.
-[Andrea laughs]

649
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:02,266
[Andrea] Yup, the famous snapdragons.

650
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,033
So are we just knocking on the door?

651
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:09,900
Kim, you knock on the door.
No one could say no to you.

652
00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:12,900
-[Kim] Okay.
-[Kourtney] Do we ask for a grapefruit?

653
00:35:12,966 --> 00:35:15,200
-Or steal one?
-[Khloe] Don't come in stealing fruit.

654
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,500
Just do it on the way out.

655
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
[doorbell chimes]

656
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:27,000
{\an8}[Khloe] Kim, you knock on the door.
No one could say no to you.

657
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:29,133
-[Kim] Okay.
-[doorbell chimes]

658
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,400
We can always see her in there usually.

659
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:34,700
-[Kim] Hi.
-[Scott] Hi. I'm...

660
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,600
-[Kim] Kim Kardashian.
-[Scott] Scott Finley.

661
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,166
{\an8}-[Kourtney] Hi. Kourtney.
-[Scott] Hi.

662
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:40,600
{\an8}-[Khloe] Nice to meet you.
-[Scott] Khloe.

663
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:43,933
[Kim] This was our grandparents' house.
Can we look around?

664
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,633
-[Scott] Come in.
-[Kourtney] We have memories here.

665
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,100
I get introduced around here as:
"Scott bought the old Kardashian place."

666
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:52,700
[Kourtney] No way.

667
00:35:52,766 --> 00:35:55,533
-[Scott] When were you last here?
-[Kim] Ten years ago.

668
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,433
-[Scott] Was it?
-[Kim] Yeah.

669
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,266
{\an8}Remember we'd sit here
pretending to make drinks at the bar?

670
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,133
What did she have in the window?
It made a sound.

671
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,733
A cuckoo thing. She would always
wave when we were coming, profusely.

672
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,166
[Kim] Palm Springs
is just such a nostalgic place for us.

673
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:15,900
I used to run through
this door when it was glass.

674
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,566
Like, I hit it three times.

675
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,933
We used to eat lunch under that thing.

676
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,566
{\an8}-[Robert] <i>Look at these people watching.</i>
-[Nana] <i>We're watching all the kids.</i>

677
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:26,566
{\an8}-[Khloe] They made us wait 30 minutes.
-To get in the pool.

678
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:27,900
What bull[bleep].

679
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:31,266
[Kim] We have so many
home videos of us in this pool.

680
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,600
{\an8}[kids screaming and laughing]

681
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,166
{\an8}[Robert] <i>That was real good, Kim.</i>

682
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:38,866
{\an8}-<i>Hi, Rob.</i>
-[Rob singing]

683
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:40,366
{\an8}[Khloe screaming]

684
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,766
[Khloe] Didn't this pool look
ginormous when you were little?

685
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,000
Our grandparents' house looks the same,

686
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:48,200
and it's so heart-warming.

687
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:51,300
We have so many
amazing memories and fun stories

688
00:36:51,366 --> 00:36:53,533
that remind us of our childhood.

689
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,900
-[Khloe] I remember everything.
-[Kim] There was a bookshelf here.

690
00:36:56,966 --> 00:37:00,500
[Andrea] Remember
she had all her Henredon and...

691
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:03,166
-[Khloe] Oh, yes.
-[Kourtney] Changed the wall color.

692
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:06,800
{\an8}[Rob] <i>A movie! Dad, look inside here!</i>

693
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:09,333
{\an8}<i>♪ Happy Easter to bunny ♪</i>

694
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,533
{\an8}[kids]<i> ♪ Happy Easter to... ♪</i>

695
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,466
-May we look in the bedroom?
-[Scott] Sure.

696
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,933
[Kim] This is where we'd cram up in here.

697
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,266
-[Andrea] Yes.
-So cute.

698
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:22,266
{\an8}[Robert] <i>What's her name?</i>
<i>Relaxing on our vacation?</i>

699
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:25,600
{\an8}<i>-And lovely makeup, Kimberly...</i>
<i>-No, my pimple medicine.</i>

700
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,066
{\an8}[Robert] <i>Pimple medicine.</i>

701
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:29,366
[Khloe] I started my period here.

702
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:33,000
I went to Mom. I had
to tell her 'cause I couldn't tell Dad.

703
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:37,000
And she made me use a tampon
for the first-- Not even, like, a pad.

704
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:39,433
I remember I was:
"What the [bleep] is this?"

705
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,200
[Kourtney] We need a vacation house.

706
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:45,133
Kourtney, thank you
so much for Palm Springs.

707
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,566
Oh, you're so welcome.

708
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:48,866
It was a trip of a lifetime.

709
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,766
[Khloe] It was...

710
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:54,233
-Delightful!
-Mighty fine!

711
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,600
[Kim] My dad's brother asked
if I could bring him a grapefruit.

712
00:37:58,666 --> 00:37:59,700
[Scott] Oh, sure.

713
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:02,600
[Kim] We would wake up
and love to pick grapefruits.

714
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,933
That was our thing.

715
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:08,566
-[engine splutters]
-[Kourtney] Bye. Uh-oh.

716
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:12,333
-Come on.
-What are we supposed to do?

717
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,733
-You're meant to pound on the brake.
-[engine starts]

718
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,666
-No, the gas, you moron.
-Oh.

719
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:20,700
-It's a classic. Bye, you guys.
-[Scott] Bye, girls. Good luck.

720
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:22,166
[Kourtney] Bye.

721
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,700
[Kris] Hey, guys.

722
00:38:34,466 --> 00:38:36,433
Are you ever not on the phone?

723
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,266
[Kim] Are <i>you</i> ever not on the phone?

724
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,533
-[Kylie] Hey.
-[Kim] Hey!

725
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,900
-[Kris] Oh, look who you found.
-Hi, Ky.

726
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:46,933
-Hey, guys.
-[Kim] You look cute.

727
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,966
[Kylie] Dream...

728
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:50,966
-Isn't she so cute?
-[Kylie] She is.

729
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:53,033
-She looks just like Rob.
-[Dream fusses]

730
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,166
-Are you okay? What's wrong?
-[Kris] I bet she's tired. I think she is.

731
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:58,933
[Dream cooing]

732
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,600
[Kylie] Okay.

733
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,466
-[Kim] You're cute.
-[Kylie] Thanks.

734
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:03,833
You're cute.

735
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,433
[Kylie] Thanks, guys.

736
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,200
I, um, wanted you guys
to know that I went to go see Dr. Huang.

737
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:13,400
-What were you doing there?
-[Kris laughs]

738
00:39:14,066 --> 00:39:15,900
Um... Well...

739
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,066
I just wanted him to give me--
Sort of I had a consultation.

740
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:25,100
Would you be able to ever
make an egg again as long as I live?

741
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,133
As hard as I could try.

742
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,266
[Kim] The fact that you
even entertained going to see Dr. Huang.

743
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,066
That ship has definitely sailed.

744
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,066
[Kourtney] You have grandkids you never...

745
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:41,566
It's in the [bleep] Bermuda Triangle
at the bottom of the ocean.

746
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:43,533
[Kris laughs] Does it?

747
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,500
I guess I kind
of got intrigued for two seconds.

748
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:50,500
I mean, there's something
very fairy tale from that whole story.

749
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:54,133
As silly as it was, I think
I just let my ego get in the way.

750
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,100
I'm not surprised, I guess,
that I'm too old to make an egg.

751
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:02,266
{\an8}-You're 61 years young. And looking great.
-Thank you.

752
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:06,733
But the reality is that, as women age,
their eggs age with them.

753
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,666
So even if we were able to get your eggs,
the quality would be not good.

754
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:15,333
-I couldn't. It would be so dangerous.
-[Dr. Huang] It wouldn't be safe.

755
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,266
The silliness of even
thinking that it was possible is...

756
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:25,366
It was kind of fun
to fantasize for a second, but...

757
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm okay with it.

758
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:32,433
I was so flattered by the offer.

759
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,500
That somebody thought
that much of me they'd want to do that.

760
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:39,300
I just wanted to go check it out.
So silly, I know.

761
00:40:39,366 --> 00:40:41,166
One thing that was interesting

762
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:45,366
was that Dr. Huang said
I would be able to carry a baby.

763
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:50,233
So, if I had an egg put inside me

764
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,266
that was already fertilized,

765
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:57,733
and it took to my uterus
that I could carry a baby to full term.

766
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,866
Don't you hear those stories where the
grandma carries the baby for her daughter?

767
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:05,400
So if you're dying
to carry a baby, just carry Kim's.

768
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:06,966
Do you want to carry mine?

769
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:10,433
If I really thought
that I could carry it for you,

770
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,500
and it would be born okay,
I would do it in two seconds.

771
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:15,966
-I really would.
-Aw. Thank you.

772
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:19,333
{\an8}I would. But it's
really dangerous. I just think...

773
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,000
I already offered myself, so don't act
like you're the only Mother Teresa here.

774
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,500
[laughter]

775
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,500
[Kim] <i>Coming up next week...</i>

776
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:30,300
[Kylie] When things
like this happen, I get excited.

777
00:41:30,366 --> 00:41:31,566
[crowd cheering]

778
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:34,366
-[Kris] You are indecisive.
-It's debilitating.

779
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:36,600
Dairy free or gluten free?

780
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:39,400
-I don't have problems with this.
-[Kris] There's a fire.

781
00:41:39,466 --> 00:41:42,966
-[Khloe] Someone's dying inside!
-[Kourtney] Khloe, I don't know.

782
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,466
-[Kris] So, what's going on with Chyna?
-We communicate very poorly.

783
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:49,566
It would kill me if I didn't have
peace between us for Dream

784
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,300
and just in general.
