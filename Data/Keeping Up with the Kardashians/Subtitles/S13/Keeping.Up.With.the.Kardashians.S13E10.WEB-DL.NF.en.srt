1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,733
{\an8}Can you believe

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,933
{\an8}that they found them?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,066
{\an8}They had caught the robbers to find out

4
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:11,066
{\an8}that there were so many people involved,

5
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:14,166
{\an8}makes me feel like I can't trust anyone.

6
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:15,400
{\an8}[Kim] I have to go to New York

7
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:17,666
{\an8}to go meet with, like, the French judge.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,566
{\an8}[Khloe] Mom, a reoccurring theme

9
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:22,500
{\an8}is that you seem to, like,

10
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,766
{\an8}not do anything with us.

11
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,733
{\an8}Like, we want to bond with you.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,700
{\an8}[Kim] Scott brought a girl out here.

13
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:28,600
Yeah.

14
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,300
{\an8}This makes me really anxious.

15
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:31,766
{\an8}[Khloe] Oh, my God.

16
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,400
{\an8}[Kourtney] I just don't want Khloe
to cause a big scene.

17
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:37,600
{\an8}[Kris] I think what we're wondering
is if you have a girl here and why.

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
[theme music playing]

19
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:52,000
{\an8}[Kris] I think what we're wondering
is if you have a girl here and why.

20
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:58,366
{\an8}Um, obviously we're both trying

21
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,366
to move on.

22
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,166
-That's what we've all been saying.
-Mm-hmm.

23
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,500
So I'm trying to do
everything I can [bleep] do

24
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:04,900
to not think about her.

25
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,566
[Khloe] But on a family trip, don't you--

26
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,566
Listen, you can do whatever you want.

27
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:12,600
On a family vacation, don't you think
it's inappropriate, disrespectful?

28
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,033
Disrespectful to who?

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,933
To me.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,933
-Really?
-And your kids.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,666
And to all my family.

32
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:22,866
[Scott] All right, we obviously
never discussed boundaries ever.

33
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,466
Well, there's just something.

34
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:27,133
There's a level of respect
and appropriateness

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,233
that should just be known.

36
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,366
But apparently it's not.

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,100
[Scott] All right, so obviously, like,

38
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,100
I did something wrong,

39
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,333
as always, like…

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,733
Well, this,
you flew someone out of the country.

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,466
[Kourtney] That is so disrespectful.

42
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,200
[Kris] Someone with any kind of integrity

43
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:43,633
would never do something like that.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,833
Dude.

45
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,933
All she wants to do,

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,633
she says she's moving on. "I'm moving on."

47
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,333
-"I'm trying to get over you."
-[Kourtney] It's nothing about me.

48
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,433
But every night
you [bleep] go to bed with our kids

49
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,066
and I have to sleep alone,

50
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,866
sad and miserable. That's my life.

51
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,966
[Kris] You should be with us

52
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,866
at the house, that we have organized…

53
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,366
I'm not strong enough to do that.

54
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,066
This all just reminds me of a life

55
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,100
that we used to have.

56
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,800
[Kourtney] Stop playing the victim.

57
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:10,933
You had your chance.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,133
I thought we were spending

59
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,533
our whole lives together

60
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,100
and I've done everything I can.

61
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,533
[Scott] That's fine.

62
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,666
I had to go back to a different lifestyle.

63
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:21,400
Then you shouldn't come
on our family vacations,

64
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,833
if you can't do four days

65
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,500
without bringing some random girl in.

66
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:26,566
It's just not cool.

67
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,600
[Scott] So let me [bleep] you,

68
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,333
then I won't have to do [bleep] like this.

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,033
You can't go four days?

70
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,933
No, I'm a sex addict.

71
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:38,200
I'm a [bleep] up, horrible sex addict.

72
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,600
So, how did you go in Aspen?

73
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,466
[Scott] I was [bleep] like crazy.

74
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:46,166
You know, saying I'm a sex addict

75
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,400
is honestly the first thing

76
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:48,466
that popped into my head,

77
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,933
and I don't really think
it's my actual problem.

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,766
But, you know, it's definitely not easy

79
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,033
hearing everybody attack me

80
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,400
and tell me how disrespectful I am

81
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,300
or I'm being.

82
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,000
And I don't know, literally,

83
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,366
what else to say.

84
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:03,066
[Khloe] If you need
to get your [bleep] wet that badly,

85
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,333
then get your [bleep] wet.

86
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,066
[Corey] I had a baby blue shirt on.

87
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:09,766
Get your [bleep] [bleep] wet

88
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:10,833
and there you go.

89
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,766
[Kris] Oh, boy.

90
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:13,466
[Scott] Oh, no. Hey!

91
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,733
[Kourtney laughing]

92
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,666
-[Kim] That was for Dubai.
-[Kris] You know what?

93
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:18,866
I'm not mad at that.

94
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,333
You kind of deserved that.

95
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,766
Oh, no!

96
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,333
And think about it.

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,833
-Should we go?
-I guess.

98
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,133
All right, should we head home together?

99
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,666
No.

100
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:31,566
You and me?

101
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:32,566
No.

102
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,266
[Khloe] I'm sorry.

103
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,066
I'm just, like, he's such a [bleep] liar,

104
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:36,966
I can't handle it.

105
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,400
[Kim] I threw one in his face.

106
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:40,033
-Why?
-[Kim] Water. I don't know,

107
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,933
just 'cause you did.

108
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,366
[both laugh]

109
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,466
[Khloe] You're walking with him?

110
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:48,133
You're walking with him?

111
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,500
-I think we're good.
-Yeah.

112
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:51,500
[Khloe] You've got
some new gel in your hair?

113
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:52,933
[Khloe] Listen, Scott,

114
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,033
don't [bleep] with us.

115
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,033
[Scott] That should be

116
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,366
the story of my life.

117
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,166
-[Khloe] We're un-[bleep]-able with.
-We're un-[bleep]-able.

118
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,600
But we really are [bleep]-able.

119
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:02,833
Have a good [bleep].

120
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,900
[Khloe] Shut up.

121
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:04,833
Wear a condom!

122
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:09,100
That actually made me feel better.

123
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,266
I definitely feel relieved

124
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,766
that we had that conversation at dinner,

125
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,933
and now I can move forward.

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,533
It's been, like, nonsense for ten years,

127
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,933
like, up and down.

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,833
So, this is, like, the final,

129
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,933
you know, door closed, we're done.

130
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,833
[phone chimes]

131
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,833
He said, "So, can I stay in your room?"
"I don't want to stay at this hotel."

132
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,800
"Now, you're right."

133
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:31,900
"I mean, I'm [bleep] gross."

134
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,500
"Like, what animal does this?"

135
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,766
"I just got to get over Kourtney somehow,

136
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,566
and I feel like the sicker I am,

137
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:39,400
the more she will never be with me,

138
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,600
and I can move on."

139
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,633
Oh, good excuse.

140
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,800
Say that.

141
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:50,866
[upbeat music playing]

142
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,266
{\an8}[Mason] Hi, Dad.

143
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,566
{\an8}[Scott] I missed you.

144
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:56,966
[Mason speaks gibberish]

145
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,533
[Scott repeats gibberish]

146
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,633
I definitely think

147
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,400
things got a little crazy last night

148
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:06,033
and the truth is I have no idea, really,

149
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,733
how the girls are gonna react today.

150
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,966
So, of course, I mean, I'm anxious.

151
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:15,400
[upbeat music playing]

152
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:25,933
You okay?

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,833
[Scott] Yeah.

154
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,400
Are you?

155
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,266
Did you like
that shower you got yesterday?

156
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,666
[Mason] What shower?

157
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,333
Your daddy got a shower.

158
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,533
I gave your… [laughs]

159
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,433
That sounds weird.

160
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,533
I threw water on your dad last night.

161
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,566
[Mason] Whoa.

162
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,600
Isn't that so crazy of KoKo?

163
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,900
[Mason] I want to do that.

164
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:43,933
[Khloe and Scott laugh]

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,300
Trust me, there will be a time.

166
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,066
It's totally hard to stay mad at Scott,

167
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,900
but also Scott and I were texting

168
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:49,800
the whole night.

169
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,566
He was so remorseful

170
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,433
and felt like a piece of [bleep].

171
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,300
So, like, what am I gonna do?

172
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:56,833
Like, kick someone when they're down?

173
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,133
It's like, he already gets what he did.

174
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,233
[Scott] So, we're good?

175
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,400
Okay, we're good.

176
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,733
So you had a nice night?

177
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,533
No.

178
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,733
[Khloe giggles]

179
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,633
We ruined it?

180
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,800
-Yeah.
-We know how to ruin things

[Scott] There she is.

So hot.

185
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:17,133

191
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,033
Yeah, you do. Right?

192
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,200
What's wrong with you today?

193

Regardless of the fiasco

194

197
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:39,766
that I have planned.

198
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,933
We are gonna be taking some helicopters

199
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,966
and going to a second location

200
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,033
and we're sleeping there.

201

'Cause I didn't know

215
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,466
that you go in an inner tube,

216
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,366

we were going white-water rafting

So, I didn't know we were getting wet.

How would you not know?

220
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,766

221

228

on our family trips,

because he's the father of my kids

a conversation with Scott,

"We will never be back together."

00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:45,933
if I put someone in jail for a long time

362
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,333
if-- I couldn't see them.

363
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,166
I mean, they literally had ski masks.

364
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:50,300
I thought you said

365
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:51,900
that you saw their eyes.

366
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:53,166
No, there was one moment

367
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:55,733
where I said, "If you get out of this,
like, look into his eyes,"

368
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,033
so when he came so close to my face

369
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,166
and he just said, "You okay, shh, shh."

370
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,033
Like, shut the [bleep] up
and you'll be okay.

371
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,633
So, I was, is there anything
I can see, see, see, see,

372
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
and then you just don't think about it.

373
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:12,033
[Kris sighing] I need some stress relief.

374
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,366
[Kim] Wait, so you just took that

375
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:17,633
from the hot spring?

376
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
I figured I'll take it

377
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,766
and spray it on my psoriasis.

378
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,333
I think I need it for <i>my </i>psoriasis.

379
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,233
Here, try it.

380
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,033
It'll make you feel younger.

381
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,533
Should I spray it on my little…?

382
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,866
[Kris] Yes.

383
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,366
Ooh, where are you spraying it?

384
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:35,800
[Kylie] It hurts.

385
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:42,700
[upbeat music playing]

386
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,400
[Khloe] Should we do same seaties?

387
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,466
[Kris] Hi, Khloe, good morning.

388
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,566
[Khloe] Good morning.

389
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:58,533
[helicopter blades whirring]

390
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:07,866
[all cheering]

391
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:08,766
[Kris] Hi, guys!

392
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,000
Hey!

393
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,533
{\an8}[Kourtney] Do we walk

394
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,933
or drive to the beach?

395
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,466
[Khloe] I'm so excited.

396
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,733
The beach is all I've been dreaming about.

397
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,033
[Kris] Now, what's this little boat

398
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,433
-out here?
-[Kourtney] What is it?

399
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:26,800
[Kris] I think we found
a paparazzi boat, Khlo.

400
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,533
-[Khloe] Awesome.
-[Kris] Two of 'em.

401
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,533
When you travel so far to relax

402
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,566
and be with the family and really try
to get away from everything,

403
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:37,766
the last thing you want to do

404
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,666
is find pictures

405
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:41,266
on the Internet of our vacation.

406
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,733
So to see them right out there on a boat

407
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,300
with a big-ass lens is unnerving.

408
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:50,333
It'll be interesting to see
if they follow you guys over to the beach.

409
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,766
[Khloe] So, who's going to the beach?

410
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
[Kim] I feel like
it's gonna be paparazzi city,

411
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:57,933
so, I just, I don't feel like doing that.

412
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:10,766
[upbeat music playing]

413
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,600
[kids laughing]

414
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:17,566
[Kim] Okay, so what is going on?

415
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,266
[Khloe] These just aren't

416
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,500
what they used to be.

417
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:22,400
We don't do group--

418
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,766
everyone is so concerned

419
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,233
about all these other things now,

420
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,166
which I get, it's our new way of life

421
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,433
and it's honestly
a really [bleep] up way to live.

422
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:31,500
Yeah.

423
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:32,933
[Khloe] Like, I go on these trips

424
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,066
hoping we're gonna bond, and I thought

425
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,633
these were, like, more memories
and experiences,

426
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,766
and I am learning
that the older we're getting,

427
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,433
it's just not working out that way.

428
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,066
So I want to know why.

429
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:44,866
I just think

430
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:47,000
that your personality is negative.

431
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:48,533
You're like, "Everyone is so negative,

432
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,266
everyone is so this,"
but you're the only one being negative.

433
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,633
You get what you give out from me.

434
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,333
But you're, like, hostile about it.

435
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,400
[Khloe] When Kim flips the script on me,

436
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,500
I feel like she's Scott.

437
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,300
Like, not taking accountability.

438
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:04,000
Like, look at how much effort

439
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:05,000
and time and everything

440
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,066
that I've put into this,

441
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,333
because I really wanted all of us

442
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
to hang out and build memories.

443
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:12,933
Like, how the [bleep] is that wrong?

444
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,666
Because I haven't seen Kylie on this trip.

445
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,700
Don't know
what the [bleep] my mom is doing.

446
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,000
Kourtney is [bleep] playing
Play-Doh with the kids.

447
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:20,133
It's, like, okay.

448
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,733
So what did we come here for?

449
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,366
Look where we're at.
Like, we're in a beautiful place.

450
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,400
Everyone relax and enjoy themselves.

451
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:27,966
[Kim] I'm relaxing. I am chilling.

452
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,100
[Scott] I just [bleep].

453
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,100
Oh, Scott, no. Hello. You come here.

454
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,766
-She's saying all I do is complain.
-[Scott] That's all of you.

455
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,166
-I feel bad. It sucks.
-I feel like let's enjoy ourselves.

456
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:38,233
-[Scott] I agree, just…
-But you don't have to be--

457
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,400
You're just snappy about it.

458
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:43,633
[Khloe] Please tell me how,

459
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,133
-when I never had an issue with you…
-You're just snappy back.

460
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
…except for…

461
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,300
Like, there's no other word

462
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:50,233
besides "snappy."

463
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,100
[dramatic music playing]

464
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,166
If you think I'm sensitive

465
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,233
or know I'm sensitive,

466
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,600
why don't you become sensitive to that

467
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,600
and my feelings?

468
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,266
Actually be kind.

469
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:06,366
Don't go ahead and then keep egging me on.

470
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,933
'Cause now you're like [bleep] annoying.

471
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:15,866
{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

472
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,599
-[Scott] Mase, you like Costa Rica?
-[Mason] Yeah.

473
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,033
My dream is that I want KiKi to be good

474
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:25,166
so we can go to the… to the ocean.

475
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,599
[Scott] Wait, I thought we were.

476
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,233
No, 'cause Kimberly doesn't want to,

477
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,600
-so we're not going to the beach.
-[Scott] What? I thought

478
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,300
that was the point,
we got back here today.

479
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:33,733
So I said, "[bleep] it,

480
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,866
I'm gonna lay out."

481
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:37,066
[Scott] Wow… this is horse manure.

482
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:38,533
[Kourtney] Khlo, there's a pap boat

483
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,700
down there.

484
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:40,866
[Khloe] I really don't care.

485
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:43,700
[Kourtney] Oh, is that the green tea?

486
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:45,100
[Scott] Yeah, I'll get it for you.

487
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,266
Thank you.

488
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,500
[Khloe] Don't spit.

489
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,200
[Kourtney] You're disgusting.

490
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,033
[Scott] We're still getting married,
though, no?

491
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,033
I think something
I've learned on this trip

492
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,133
is that we need…

493
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:02,000
[Scott] Yeah?

494
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:04,000
…to just move on.

495
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,366
[Scott] Perfect.

496
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,200
You've driven me nuts for ten years.

497
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:10,366
There's not anything bad

498
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:11,733
you can say about me.

499
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,500
Stop pushing your ass out

500
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:14,500
and [bleep].

501
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:15,933
[Kourtney] I'm scratching my back.

502
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,800
[Scott] Okay. You know what you're doing.

503
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,100
What have you done?

504
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,400
For ten years?

505
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:22,900
[Scott] Bothered you, too.

506
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:23,866
[Kourtney] Bothered?

507
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:25,333
Is that what you call it?

508
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,266
I think the moral of the story

509
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,333
is we are never getting back together.

510
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,800
[Scott] Done.

511
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,766
That's all I've ever wanted you to say.

513
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,500
after everything that's happened

514
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:41,966
here in Costa Rica,

515
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,233
Scott knows that it's done,

516
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,000
but just saying those words,

517
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:50,000
just, like, let's both of us move on

518
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:53,300
and just feel like, okay, it's done.

519
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,666

-[King] What?

522
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,400
[Kourtney] Uncle Scott.

523
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:02,833
Yeah, King!

524
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:06,100
[King] I forgot his name.

537
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,166
-You're all Chaneled out.
-It's a bathing suit.

538
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,433
Oh, that's so cute.

539
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
With a…

540
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:38,733
-[Kris] Oh!
-…Chanel.

541
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,466
You're just like a little Kris

542
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:41,833
in the '80s, aren't you?

543
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,400
[Kim] Yeah.

544
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:44,800
[Kris] What's up, guys?

545
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,733
[Kim] Um, I wanted to come up here

546
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,633
and talk to you

547
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,100
because I really feel bad for Khloe.

548
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,166
We just got into, like, a really big fight

549
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,300
-and she, like, stormed off.
-Aw.

550
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,400
[Kim] She said, you know,

551
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:56,100
we used to always come on these trips

552
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,866
and they were so much fun and now, like,

553
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,400
they're just not that fun anymore

554
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,233
and maybe we shouldn't go anymore,

555
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,233
and that was just, like, super hurtful.

556
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:07,733
Khloe's always been really sensitive.

557
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,266
Like, it's wild.

558
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,533
Maybe she thinks

559
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,333
we're moving on in life

560
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,366
because we have kids and this and that,

561
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:17,533
-and what, like…
-And then she acts like a [bleep]

562
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,166
-and then alienates us even more.
-Then no one wants to hang out.

563
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:21,300
Yeah.

564
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:22,966
Self-sabotage.

565
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,000
[Kim whispering] Yes.

566
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,566
I think as everybody grows up,

567
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:28,600
that everybody experiences

568
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,866
something different,

569
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:31,333
but if she's not having any fun,

570
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,300
then let's change that.

571
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:34,000
I feel like we should go talk to her.

572
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,433
Okay. Come on, Kourtney.

573
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,566
Khlo-mo!

574
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,733
Where's my little piece of sunshine

575
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,533
in your yellow bathing suit?

576
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,033
[Kourtney] I like yellow on you.

577
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,433
[Kim] That's your color, for sure.

578
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,066
[Kris] So I was just talking to Kim,

579
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:48,633
and she was telling me

580
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,400
that you weren't feeling like

581
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:51,933
this trip was going

582
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,866
the way that you would have wanted it
to go.

583
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:57,433
And we're not spending enough time,

584
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,366
all of us, together.

585
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,300
[Khloe] It's just interesting

586
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:02,000
how I don't see you guys a lot,

587
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:04,966
and I take the time to come here

588
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,833
thinking "Oh, great, this is, like, time

589
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,800
where I get to be with my sisters

590
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:11,233
and, you know, my nieces and nephews,

591
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,766
and do all these things."

592
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,333
This house is absolutely extraordinary,

593
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,866
but, like, going to the beach

594
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,000
and, like, just doing--

595
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,400
when will I ever go
to a Costa Rican beach?

596
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:21,666
I don't know.

597
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:22,966
Kylie and Tyga are locked away

598
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,066
in their rooms,

599
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:25,266
you and Corey are doing

600
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,466
whatever you and Corey do,

601
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,000
you don't like to do any activities.

602
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:29,466
[Kris] I love to do activities,

603
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:30,733
-believe me.
-Kim has her things

604
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,600
-where she's…
-[Kim] Just 'cause I was afraid

605
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,266
of the white-water raft? What's the point

606
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,533
of making it not fun for us
to want to hang out with you

607
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,533
-if you're always snappy?
-No one hang out with me,

608
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,766
[Kris] We want to hang out with you.
You're the funniest,

609
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,933
most fun girl we know.
-[Kim] It's not that, just--

610
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,733
You've ruined my mood already today,

611
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,366
so, you guys could all get away from me.

612
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,866
[Kourtney] What can we do to have fun?
-I don't know.

613
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,300
[Kim] It is so annoying
that you're so snappy.

614
00:21:51,366 --> 00:21:53,666
[Khloe] No, I'm over all you people now.

615
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:55,833
Ungrateful family members that I can't…

616
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,133
[Kim] This is what I can't handle--
you're just so [bleep],

617
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,066
you're so annoying,

618
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,100
but it's like, "Shut the [bleep] up."

619
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:03,133
You're the negative one

620
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,533
just saying how awful we are

621
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,500
and how this-- You're like a big bully

622
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:07,666
that bullies all of us.

623
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:08,866
You people.

624
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:10,366
You bully us people.

625
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,600
[Khloe] I want us all

626
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,900
to [bleep] spend time together.

627
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:16,466
How am I at fault for that

628
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,033
and how is that a bad thing?

629
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,566
I still don't understand that.

630
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:20,633
But at some point

631
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,200
you have to say "[bleep] it"

632
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:23,700
and just not try anymore.

633
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,366
[Kim] Truly, Khloe is really annoying.

634
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,066
Like, we went out there to say

635
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:36,400
I'm sorry, you know, Kourtney and Scott

636
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:37,766
have each other with the kids,

637
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,533
I'm with the kids, like I get it.

638
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,100
And she's just like, "Nothing!

639
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,566
No! I'm-I'm mad 'cause this!" You know.

640
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:45,633
I feel like you guys

641
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,400
just always are getting on each other

642
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,333
for everything.

643
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,633
But she can't just be like, "Okay, reset…"

644
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,066
[Scott] Reset is the best button ever.

645
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:54,000
[Kim] Totally, like…

646
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:55,300
[Scott] I'm super into it.

647
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:56,366
[Kim] Yeah. Can't do it.

648
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:57,766
[Scott] Maybe it's time for you

649
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,200
to end this whole Kardashian thing.

650
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:01,166
Maybe it's becoming a curse
for the girls, too.

651
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:03,100
Just break up and all do your own thing

652
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,000
for a little bit.

653
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,066
[Kim] Good advice.

654
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:07,966
[Scott] See, you don't want to.

655
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,933
Everybody's got a little bit of a reason

656
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,433
why everybody's mad at each other,

657
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,466
but I think

658
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:14,200
everybody wants the same thing.

659
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:15,966
-Yeah.
-You have your crap,

660
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:17,566
she has hers.

661
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:18,733
You want to try to have fun,

662
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,600
but you have fun a different way
than she does,

663
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,733
and you worry about stuff

664
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,633
a little bit more,

665
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,733
maybe that frustrates her.

666
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,566
[Kim] I know Khloe put in so much work

667
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:30,966
to plan this vacation

668
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:32,366
and spend time with us

669
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:33,833
and all of our families,

670
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,200
so I don't want Khloe to feel separated

671
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:37,833
or just, you know, like, alone.

672
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,200
I don't want to ruin this trip

673
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:41,266
over a stupid fight.

674
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,166
All I know is,

675
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:43,633
I don't want to be in the middle.

676
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,700
I don't need this [bleep] in my life.

677
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:46,600
I already have

678
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,900
one little bully in my life.

679
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:50,066
-[Kim] All right.
-I'm going to go hang out with Khloe

680
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,100
and make pretend
I didn't have this conversation.

681
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:58,500
[dance music playing]

682
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:02,733
[Joe] How are you feeling? Not tired?

683
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,833
{\an8}[Khloe] A little tired.

684
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,733
[Joe] Okay, let's do this.

685
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,833
-Lift. Two.
-[Khloe groans]

686
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,466
[Khloe] Ever since the fight,

687
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,033
I'm just gonna do what I want to do,

688
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,000
and, like, my happy place is the gym

689
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,633
so, even though we're on this vacation,

690
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:22,433
I'm going to work out.

691
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,000
[Kylie] Hey.

692
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:25,500
Hi.

693
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:26,700
I just wanted to give you

694
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,033
an intermission hug.

695
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,133
[Khloe] I'm all sweaty.

696
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,233
I have Snapchat glasses.

697
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,400
[Kylie] Snapchat glasses?

698
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:35,300
What?

699
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:36,633
[Khloe] Wait, come here.

700
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,666
[Kylie] So they Snapchat?

701
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:39,566
[Khloe] Watch, look.

702
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:41,866
Is it blinking?

703
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:44,500
-[Kylie] Yes.
-[Khloe] Hi, Kylie, you're on my Snapchat.

704
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,200
-[Kylie] How?
-[Khloe] 'Cause it's showing,

705
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:48,166
and then when it starts,
it's only ten seconds.

706
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:50,600
-[Kylie] And it's live?
-[Khloe] No, I get to approve it later

707
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,166
-and then push it through.
-[Kylie] Hey!

708
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:54,033
[Khloe] So I'm snapping my workout.

709
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,133
[Kylie] Khloe…

710
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,933
[Khloe laughs]

711
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,533
[Kylie] Always in cleavage.

712
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,066
[laughing] I just want to…

713
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,900
[all talking over each other]

714
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,733
[Joe] …three, one, okay.

715
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,366
[Khloe] This one has never worked out

716
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:07,600
a day in her life.

717
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,266
[Kim] Wait, I want to do this exercise.

718
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,833
[brass stabs playing]

719
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,800
[Khloe] You want to work out, too, now?

720
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:15,633
[Kim] I kind of do, but my shoes

721
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,066
are all the way upstairs and stuff.

722
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:19,966
I don't want to leave this trip

723
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:22,433
on a bad note with this fight.

724
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,533
I want Khloe to know

725
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,700
that I love that she took the time

726
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:28,300
and the effort to come on vacation with us

727
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:30,000
and plan this vacation,

728
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:32,333
so I'm going to make one last effort

729
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,933
to make up with Khloe.

730
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,500
{\an8}[Kim] Wait, I want to do this exercise.

731
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,766
[Khloe] You want to work out, too, now?

732
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,166
[Kim] I kinda do, but my shoes

733
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:48,100
are all the way upstairs and stuff.

734
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,266
[Joe] Feel it. Two, one…

735
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,500
[Khloe] Oh, [bleep].

736
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:52,833
-[Kim] Wait, I want to try that.
-[Kylie] Want to do it?

737
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,366
You think that's the easy part.

738
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:56,100
Just wait till he starts pushing it down.

739
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:57,300
[Joe] Bend on your knee.

740
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:59,333
Okay, and from here, like, push up.

741
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,066
Okay, feel it.

742
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,333
[Khloe] Keep pushing.

743
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,966
Kylie and Kim in the fitness room with me.

744
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,700
This is honestly the peak of my trip.

745
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,400
-[Kylie] This is the peak of your trip?
-Yes, 'cause you are with me.

746
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:11,300
I swear to God,

747
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:13,100
this is the best time of my trip.

748
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,433
Working out and with them.

749
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,966
[Kim] We want to get on Khloe's level.

750
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:16,866
[Khloe] No, you guys,

751
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:18,466
this is the best part.

752
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:21,366
[Kim] I definitely wanted
to join the workout

753
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:22,733
just to hang out with you.

754
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,200
And I love that.

755
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,000
That's all I want is, like, family time.

756
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,600
I don't have to do something.

757
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,200
Doing nothing together.

758
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:31,466
-It's like, that's what life is about.
-Totally.

759
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,833
Watch. Now you push this,

760
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,833
and you're going to see,

761
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,666
like, a little light, and it's on.

762
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:38,800
[Kylie] Ew.

763
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:40,100
[Khloe] Ew!

764
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,900
[Kim laughing]

765
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:43,500
I wonder what this looks like.

766
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:45,033
I pray this [bleep] works.

767
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,066
[upbeat music playing]

768
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:56,366
-[Kris] Hey, babe.
-[Corey] Hey, what's happening?

769
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:58,033
[Kris] This is pretty.

770
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,333
[Corey] Yeah, it look like you.

771
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,266
[Kris] Aw. Who's that? Khloe?

772
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,400
[Khloe] It is so pretty.

773
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:07,900
-[Kris] Isn't this great?
-Oh, it's unbelievable.

774
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:10,566
But I do kind of feel like
I'm on <i>The</i> <i>Bachelor,</i>

775
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,633
and I'm going to get, like, my rose.

776
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,833
So, does someone have a rose for me?

777
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,366
[Kris] I asked them to set
this dinner up for us out here tonight

778
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:18,566
because I didn't want

779
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:20,233
another dinner on the patio.

780
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,333
[Khloe] You look gorgeous

781
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,266
with your hand on your hip, Kris.

782
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,400
[Kris chuckles]

783
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:26,933
It's so pretty here.

784
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,633
-[Kourtney] Hi.
-[Kris] Hey, Kourt.

785
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,800
[Khloe] Hi, Reigny.

786
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,233
[Kris chuckles]

787
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,200
Hey, T.

788
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,833
Kourtney.

789
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:36,633
There he goes.

790
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,933
He copied you.

791
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:40,500
[Mason] Daddy's here!

792
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:42,033
[Scott] It's a hike getting down here.

793
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:43,466
[Kris] Here they come

794
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:45,033
for their first number.

795
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,000
[all cheering]

796
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,933
The longest runway ever.

797
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:53,133
[Khloe] This food looks so good-- yummy.

798
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,366
[Kris] Babe, will you hand me

799
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:57,233
-one of those white things?
-[Kourtney] What's that? Potato salad?

800
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,366
[Kris] That looks good.

801
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:00,966
[Kim] Kylie, do you like or not?

802
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:02,100
[Kylie] Yeah, I don't mind.

803
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:03,633
[Kris] Okay, let's go around the table

804
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,900
and do the pit and the peak.

805
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:05,800
So, Kim…

806
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:07,400
-Kim?
-Yeah?

807
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:08,433
[Kris] We're gonna start.

808
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,333
What is your pit,

809
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,766
and what is your peak?

810
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,900
[Kim] My pit is that Kanye is not here.

811
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:15,666
And my peak

812
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:17,900
is that I get an amazing vacation

813
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:19,966
with the kids and my family.

814
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,400
[Kris] Kylie, what's your pit
and your peak?

815
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:24,333
I don't like being away from home,
that's my pit.

816
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,033
[Kris] You don't like
to be away from home?

817
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,366
[Kylie] My peak, I don't know,

818
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:28,433
being with you guys.

819
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,700
[Kourtney] What about tubing?

820
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:30,966
That was so fun.

821
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:32,333
[Kylie] That was cute.

822
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,000
[Kourtney] My peak was tubing

823
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,766
and doing the water slides,

824
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:41,000
and spending time with my kids and family.

825
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:42,166
[Scott] I think my pit was

826
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:43,700
that Mase didn't come tubing,

827
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:46,066
but my peak was
the water slides with the kids.

828
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:46,966
[Mason] Oh, yeah.

829
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:48,266
[Scott] That was fun.

830
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,766
-That was fun, Mase.
-You were good.

831
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:52,700
[Kourtney] And my pit was probably

832
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:56,733
the anxiety going
to the confrontational dinner.

833
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,366
[Kris] The pit of the trip is

834
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:02,666
that I couldn't do the tubing,

835
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,333
and I think the peak,

836
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,833
I love being all together

837
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,266
on any family vacay,

838
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,866
because it's memories we're gonna make

839
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:11,400
that are gonna last a lifetime,

840
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,266
so, I love these trips.

841
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:18,133
The one thing that we have as a family

842
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,366
is each other.

843
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,100
And nothing will ever change

844
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:23,300
the love and the bond that we all share.

845
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:24,200
And it's really nice

846
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:26,200
to come together on these vacations,

847
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,033
no matter how old the kids get,

848
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,566
and just reconnect.

849
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,933
Khloe, what was your pit?

850
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,133
[Khloe] The pit of my trip is

851
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,133
how so many people love to complain.

852
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,500
[Mason] Whoa, good idea.

853
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:39,666
[Khloe] Good answer, right?

854
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:40,833
I don't like complainers.

855
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,800
[Mason] Same.

856
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:43,233
[Khloe] And the peak of my trip

857
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,333
is that I loved inner-tubing together,

858
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,533
I loved seeing the volcano,

859
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:50,733
I loved our workout.

860
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,733
So I had kind of a lot of peaks.

861
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,133
And all the kids are having

862
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,066
-a slumber party in my room.
-[all cheering]

863
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:58,866
[Kris] Yay, Khloe!

864
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:00,800
[Kim] Can Northy do her peak and her pit?

865
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,266
-[Kris] Yes.
-Okay, what's your peak?

866
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,566
That's the best part.

867
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:05,600
[North] Giving hugs to you.

868
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:06,533
Aw.

869
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,000
Well, that's your peak.

870
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:10,433
[Khloe] Ooh, look, dancers.

871
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,000
[Kim] Oh, look at the dancers, bubs.

872
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:13,600
[Khloe] What are they doing, King?

873
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,833
-[Kris] How good is this?
-[Spanish music playing]

874
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,866
[Kris] Oh…

875
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:19,033
[all cheering]

876
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,266
-[Kris] Beautiful.
-[Khloe] Ooh.

877
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,400
[Kris] This is pretty.

878
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,966
[all cheering]

879
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,933
[Khloe] Oh, my. Everyone up.

880
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,000
Look, we can go dance.
We can do it together.

881
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:34,133
-[dance music playing]
-Northy, look at you.

882
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,900
[Khloe] Ooh. Come on, King.

883
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:37,966
[man laughing]

884
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,066
[Khloe] Whoo!

885
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:41,600
[Kris] Kourtney, do you want to dance?

886
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,066
[Kourtney] I'm not a good dancer.

887
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,800
[Tyga] You got a disclaimer.

888
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:46,966
[Khloe] Yay!

889
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,100
[all cheering]

890
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,000
-[Kris] Thank you.
-Say adios.

891
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,300
-[Kourtney] Can I Snapchat Mike?
-[Jen] Cute.

892
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:56,166
And say when Mr. Mike Rosenthal

893
00:30:56,233 --> 00:30:57,533
{\an8}is in Costa Rica.

894
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,500
{\an8}Well, then I need to snap you, too.

895
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,866
Jen and Mike, when Mr. Mike Rosenthal

896
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:04,166
is in Costa Rica…

897
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:05,466
[Jen] I'm his assistant.

898
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,533
[Kourtney] We need
a late- night photo shoot.

899
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,566
[Mike] She a hard worker.

900
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:09,500
[Kourtney laughs]

901
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:10,400
[Kylie] Kourtney,

902
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:11,933
are you naked under this?

903
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,833
[Kourtney] Yeah.

904
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,533
[Kylie] So you really are getting naked?

905
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:16,066
[Kourtney] Yes!

906
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:17,566
What do you mean?

907
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:19,633
Kylie, I bet you can't fight.

908
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,800
Let's have, like, a fake fight, okay?

909
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,000
Just to see.

910
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:25,600
[Kylie] Okay. Fake fight.

911
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:28,733
[laughs]

912
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,066
[Kourtney] Wait, there's nothing

913
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:31,000
under my robe.

914
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,000
Ow!

915
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:34,433
[Kylie] This is not a fake fight.

916
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,766
[Kourtney] I have your vagina!

917
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,000
[Kylie] This is not a fake fight!

918
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:41,233
You punched me in my tit!

919
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,900
Ow!

920
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:44,633
-[Kourtney] Okay, what?
-[Khloe] Kourtney…

921
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,300
Do your shoot and focus.

922
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:47,466
[Kourtney] Oh, sorry.

923
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:49,500
[Friend] Kourt, take it off.

924
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:50,466
[Kourtney] Okay.

925
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:53,500
[Khloe] Kourtney!

926
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:54,700
[all cheering]

927
00:31:54,766 --> 00:31:56,200
You're naked!

928
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,066
[Kim whoops]

929
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:59,233
[Jen] Get a bit more naked.

930
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,200
[Kylie] Can you take
your Cartier bracelets off?

931
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:02,600
[Kourtney laughs]

932
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,566
-[Mike] Beautiful.
-[Khloe] This is so good.

933
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,566
-[Mike] Oh, my God.
-[Khloe] So good.

934
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:09,666
[Jen] Kourt, you are giving life
right now.

935
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:10,733
[Kourtney] I'm just doing

936
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,266
what I've always loved to do.

937
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:17,933
[Khloe] I honestly was worried about you

938
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,166
after Penelope.

939
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:21,133
I did think, like, she's gone.

940
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,533
Worried for my soul?

941
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,066
Yeah. Now, she's YOLO'ing it up,

942
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:27,966
[bleep] bomb-ass body, naked in the pool.

943
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:31,000
And your sisters should be afraid of you.

944
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,500
[Kourtney snaps]

945
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,633
[Friend] Oh, my God! It's so good.

946
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,700
[Kylie] Wait, let me see.

947
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:38,933
[Mike] So…

948
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,733
[Kylie] What the [bleep].
I want to get in.

949
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,100
[Khloe] Kylie is getting jealous,

950
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,266
you guys.

951
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,833
[Kylie] I'm so jealous!

952
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,633
[Khloe] Yes!

953
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,133
[dance music playing]

954
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,133
[Joe] You ready?

955
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,700
We're gonna do the side. Cool.

956
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,933
One, two, three. Kim.

957
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,700
-[Khloe] Oh, Kim's here?
-Have we started?

958
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:01,733
Last night was the first night

959
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,066
I had nightmares.

960
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,600
[Khloe] About what?

961
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,233
[Kim] Just, like, about scary stuff.

962
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,366
[Khloe] Well, I'm sorry. That's not good.

963
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:09,800
[Kim] I started having a nightmare,

964
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:11,166
and then I was like, "Wake up."

965
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:12,500
And I, like, woke up…

966
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:13,633
[Khloe] I do those dreams.

967
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,200
Those are, like, more night terrors.

968
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:16,566
When, like, you can't wake up,

969
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:17,466
and you know you…

970
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:18,500
you know you're dreaming.

971
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:20,766
-And you're just, like…
-I couldn't, but I got up.

972
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,733
But I was, like, in it for a while.

973
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,300
But is it from your… trauma?

974
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:27,866
Not that specifically,

975
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:28,766
but a new one.

976
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,900
Because maybe your court date's coming up?

977
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:32,733
-Yeah.
-You probably have

978
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,200
anxiety you don't know about.

979
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:35,800
Yeah.

980
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,066
I have to fly to New York

981
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,300
to meet with the French judge

982
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:43,500
to give my whole testimony.

983
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,866
But I didn't really realize

984
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,866
how much it would affect me.

985
00:33:47,933 --> 00:33:50,000
I just don't know
if I'll be able to relive

986
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:51,300
that night of what happened.

987
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:53,533
So, I'm just super anxious.

988
00:33:55,833 --> 00:34:00,533
{\an8}[upbeat music playing]

989
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:04,633
[Khloe] Hi, P.

990
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,966
Can I have a hug good morning?

991
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:07,900
You look so beautiful.

992
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:09,166
[Penelope] Thank you.

993
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:10,199
[Khloe] You're welcome.

994
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,100
[Kim] Hey, everyone,

995
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,566
I'm getting in the car and I'm leaving.

996
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,733
[Kourtney] All right,
let's get everyone to pack it up.

997
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,199
[Khloe] Thank you so much. Thank you.

998
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:22,733
And I'll see you soon hopefully.

999
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,766
I did have a great trip
and I definitely would want to come

1000
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:27,666
back here,

1001
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,100
but probably
with a different group of people.

1002
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,133
-Good for you.
-Yeah.

1003
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,166
I'm happy for you.

1004
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:33,500
[Khloe] I would go with you.

1005
00:34:33,566 --> 00:34:35,266
You and I have a good time together.

1006
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,166
Yeah.

1007
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:37,666
Good one, "Yeah."

1008
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:39,199
I could literally just sit here

1009
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:40,333
and be you.

1010
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,233
-[imitates Kourtney] Yeah.
-[Kourtney chuckles]

1011
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,600
-Thank you so much.
-It was a pleasure to have you.

1012
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:48,366
[Khloe] Hello.

1013
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:49,266
[Kris] Hi.

1014
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,766
You guys, that was the best.

1015
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:53,066
[Khloe] Yeah.

1016
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,900
[upbeat music playing]

1017
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:04,400
[Kim] Northy, do you want to help me?

1018
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:05,700
Which outfit should Saint wear?

1019
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:07,133
Should he wear this one…

1020
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:09,566
or this one?

1021
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,866
[North] I like this coat,

1022
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:16,800
and these shoes and this shirt.

1023
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,166
Oh, but I was either thinking

1024
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,800
this whole outfit here,

1025
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:23,133
or this outfit here.

1026
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,866
-I don't like that one.
-[knock on door]

1027
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:26,933
[Kim gasps] Someone's here.
You want to get the door?

1028
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,933
-[North] Mm-hmm.
-Okay, you go. You go.

1029
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh, my goodness.

1030
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,100
My black swan.

1031
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:34,800
[Jonathan] Hello.

1032
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,533
[Kim] Say, "Hey!"

1033
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,466
Oh, my God,

1034
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:39,733
look who's the prettiest girl

1035
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,366
in the whole wide world and New York City.

1036
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:43,933
I'm, like, in my sweats.

1037
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:46,366
-I like this jacket.
-Thank you.

1038
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:48,200
I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.

1039
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:49,933
[Jonathan] So, tell me why you're here,

1040
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,666
I don't understand.
You're on trial here? I'm so confused.

1041
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,566
No, we're here

1042
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:57,133
because the judge needs me to… like,

1043
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
they're still
in the investigation process,

1044
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:02,166
so basically, they're gonna show me
pictures of everyone.

1045
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:03,600
But you never saw their faces.

1046
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:04,600
-Just voices?
-Yeah.

1047
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:07,500
But I don't know what it'll trigger

1048
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,433
when I, like, look at them.

1049
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,566
Just knowing that they caught them

1050
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:14,533
and that they will possibly bring photos,

1051
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,800
I think, um,

1052
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:19,833
that's just what gives me
the most anxiety,

1053
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,800
is just to put faces

1054
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:26,100
with the terror

1055
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:29,533
that I, you know… went through

1056
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,300
and just have to, like, put
all the pieces together now.

1057
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,566
They're gonna have, like, weapons charges,

1058
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:35,700
attempted murder…

1059
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:38,000
-[Jonathan] Kidnapping.
-[Kim] Robbery and kidnapping.

1060
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:40,166
[Jonathan] Is there gonna be,
like, one trial for them?

1061
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:42,600
[Kim] There'll be a trial.
The judge is going to ask me to go,

1062
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:45,266
but in the trial, they'll get an actress

1063
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,533
that will be-- play me,

1064
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,900
and actors to play the robbers,

1065
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:49,433
and they have to act it all out

1066
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,733
and have us watch it.

1067
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,166
[Stephanie] Is that a normal thing?

1068
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:54,300
-[Kim] I have no idea.
-[Stephanie] This sounds wild.

1069
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:55,933
-[Kim] Right?
-[Stephanie] I've never heard

1070
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,900
of something like this.

1071
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,266
[Kim] And then we have to tell them
if that's what happened.

1072
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,733
They want to feel the trauma of, like,
what's really gone on.

1073
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,633
Oh, my God.

1074
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,600
I think that they'll get bigger sentences
if you're at the sentencing.

1075
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,100
I just don't feel safe,

1076
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:08,600
I don't feel-- you know what I mean?

1077
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,433
Like, why would I go
put myself through that?

1078
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,166
[Jonathan] I think
you should [bleep] them.

1079
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,633
Put those ass[bleep] in jail
for a long time,

1080
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,633
which they deserve.

1081
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,966
[Kim] I'm just nervous

1082
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:20,300
if I have to, like, look at them
in their face…

1083
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:22,400
-[Jonathan] You could do it.
-…In court.

1084
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:26,233
I definitely respect their system

1085
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,600
and they were so great
at finding everyone.

1086
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:29,766
And I'm so willing to help

1087
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,433
in any way that I can,

1088
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,566
but having to reenact that night of what
happened,

1089
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:37,166
I just don't know
if I would feel comfortable doing that.

1090
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,600

[Kris over phone] <i>Hey.</i>

1097
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:33,566
{\an8}Hey, what are you doing?

1098
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,133
{\an8}<i>Just, uh, getting online</i>

1099
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,500
<i>'cause Kylie has a launch</i>

1100
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,600
<i>in a couple minutes.</i>

1101
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:40,766
Oh, fun.

1102
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:41,666
<i>Yeah.</i>

1103
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,733
Um, so I just finished

1104
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,033
with my court date.

1105
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:47,100
<i>What happened?</i>

1106
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,033
I was there

1107
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,933
until, like, literally from 10:00 a.m.

1108
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,300
until 6:00 p.m.

1109
00:38:53,866 --> 00:38:55,600
<i>Oh, geez, honey, I'm so sorry</i>

1110
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,366
<i>you have to go through that.</i>

1111
00:38:57,433 --> 00:38:59,500
It was just a really long thing

1112
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:01,533
because, like, you have to explain it

1113
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,666
to a translator, then the translator

1114
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:07,100
has to explain it to the judge.

1115
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,666
Then she writes it with the clerk,

1116
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:10,466
then they have to read what you wrote.

1117
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:12,533
You have to do it sentence by sentence.

1118
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,133
Going in there, I was so worked up

1119
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,300
wanting to, like, explain it so quickly

1120
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:18,366
and you just can't do that.

1121
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:20,266
You just have to, like, be really slow

1122
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:23,433
and walk through the entire night,

1123
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,566
like, second by second.

1124
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,166
And that was just really hard.

1125
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:29,400
So they showed me pictures of all of them.

1126
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:31,000
[Kris] <i>Oh, wow.</i>

1127
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:32,733
But, like, one guy

1128
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,066
admitted to driving them,

1129
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:38,633
and then, one inside admitted it.

1130
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:41,400
I think it was really interesting

1131
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,500
to see the faces of everyone.

1132
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:47,333
Just by their height and weight,

1133
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,700
I could tell who, from this lineup,

1134
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:51,766
was in the room with me.

1135
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,466
I was able to see who confessed.

1136
00:39:54,533 --> 00:39:57,433
One of them was the guy

1137
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,300
that was in the room with me,

1138
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:01,300
and it was very interesting

1139
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:02,800
to hear his story.

1140
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:05,400
And it was pretty similar to my story.

1141
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:07,266
Of course, there was, like, a few things

1142
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,000
that they're not saying

1143
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:10,133
to get lesser charges.

1144
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,233
But they were pretty honest

1145
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,233
and did tell most of the story

1146
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,866
exactly like how it happened.

1147
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:20,300
So, um… you know, it's just--

1148
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:22,333
it's really interesting to see

1149
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:25,333
what their side of the story is,

1150
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,933
and to hear the background information

1151
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,566
about how they had been following me

1152
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:31,033
and how they attempted to rob me

1153
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,600
the last time I was in Paris.

1154
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:33,800
But my husband was with me,

1155
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,666
and there was too many people around me.

1156
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,433
So, to hear that come out of their mouths,

1157
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,833
you know, I had an idea

1158
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,200
like, "Oh my God, my, you know, husband

1159
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:43,533
just gave me a new ring,

1160
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,933
and so they saw it,

1161
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,566
and I posted it on social media."

1162
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:48,266
Like, they had been following me

1163
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,600
from the year before.

1164
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:51,866
And so, what I had in my mind

1165
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:54,000
of how the whole thing happened

1166
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:55,100
was really different,

1167
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,966
and it just is so scary to know

1168
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:58,800
that this would have happened to me

1169
00:40:58,866 --> 00:40:59,833
at some point.

1170
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,533
So I'm just, like, I'm really happy

1171
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,100
that I got it over with

1172
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,100
and it's, like, done.

1173
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:05,266
Because, no matter what,

1174
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,200
it would have happened to me. It just--

1175
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:09,600
my awareness now of my surroundings

1176
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:12,300
is so different and so heightened,

1177
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:15,566
and, you know,
I'm honestly, like, thankful

1178
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:16,933
for this experience

1179
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,533
and that I have all the insider info

1180
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,066
and background information now

1181
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:23,300
on how they plotted and planned this,

1182
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:25,333
so that I can prepare and protect myself

1183
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,900
even more in the future.

1184

1186
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:31,566
It's all right,

the worst driver I've ever met.

1196
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,633
Kourtney is a horrible driver.

Oh, [bleep].

What are you doing?

1200
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,966
I'm pushing, I'm really strong.

Oh, shut up, [bleep]!

1203
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:57,666
Wait, what is this?

1204
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:59,866
I got a letter from a royal family,

1205

requesting to purchase my eggs.

1206
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,133
Okay, now, that's weird.

1207
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,266
Don't count me out yet.
