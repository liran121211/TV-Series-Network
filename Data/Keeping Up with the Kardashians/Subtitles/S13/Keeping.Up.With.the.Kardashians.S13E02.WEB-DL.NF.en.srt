00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,357
[Kourtney] Should I take a shower
or do I not have time?

175
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,959
-[Kim] Yeah, I would.
-Okay.

176
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,060
[Kim] Just that I would hurry.

177
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,128
Kanye's coming for one night.

178
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,997
-[Kourtney] Yeah.
-[Kim] He lands in an hour.

179
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,966
So, we'll figure out the sleeping sitch.

180
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,568
Ooh, fun times.

181
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,205
So, this is one option.

182
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,441
Or if you wanted to do…

183
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,143
[Simone] This top is really cute.
So should we try?

184
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,044
[Kourtney] Yeah.

185
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,680
I feel like it's not, like…

186
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,482
-[Simone] I'm not, like…
-Special.

187
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,351
[electronic music]

188
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,619
I'll show Kim.

189
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,422
And I'm definitely exhausted
from racing from the airport.

190
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,925
-Not flattering.
-[Kourtney] Yeah.

191
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,127
But we're also, like, crunched for time

192
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,197
because we just have to get ready
and get there.

193
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,432
[Kim] Not super-fab.

194
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,335
{\an8}[upbeat music]

195
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,407
[Kim] Hi, babe.

196
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,142
I'm so glad you're here.

197
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,946
Kanye saw pictures online
of an outfit that I was in,

198
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,848
and was like, "I have to fly out there

199
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,550
and help you with your looks."

200
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,685
[Kanye] I just… I'm missing something.

201
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,853
This is not the right color.

202
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,788
He has his tour still going on,

203
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,524
so he had one day off
and was able to break away

204
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,928
to help us get our outfits all set up
for the Balmain Show.

205
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,129
[Kourtney]
What kind of shoes would I wear?

206
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,564
[Kanye] I don't mind that look.

207
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,634
Kourtney just landed.
She hardly had any time to get ready.

208
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,735
So, no earrings?

209
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,071
I like it with the sunglasses only.

210
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,207
It's our first show,
so this sets the tone.

211
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,810
So, we really just…
our first show is so important.

212
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,379
Glasses the whole time, during the show?

213
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,948
-[Kris] Hi, Kourt.
-[Kourtney] Hi.

214
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,816
[Kris] I didn't even see you
standing there.

215
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:44,984
[Kourtney] Hi. Hi, Corey.

216
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,886

{\an8}[cameras clicking]

218
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,098
[Kourtney] We're at the Balmain Show,

219
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,101
which is my first Paris Fashion Week show.

220
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:03,769
{\an8}Hello, you!

221
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:04,837
{\an8}Oh, hi.

222
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,906
{\an8}-Very chic! Thank you for being here!
-You've been working hard.

223
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,475
[Kourtney] Everything is so
high-energy and fast-paced.

224
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,177
It's just, like, really exciting.

225
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,778
[man 2] Thank you so much.

[upbeat music]

228
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,260
[Kim] Sitting in the front row is just
such an honor.

229
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,497
It's always so much fun when your friends
are working on exciting things

230
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,898
and they kind of talk about it
along the way.

[music continues]

232
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:42,375
Seeing all the models and final product
is so amazing.

233
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,409
I'm so proud of Olivier.

234
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,111
It's such, like, a powerful moment.

You liked it?

238
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,222
[Kourtney] Insane!
I loved every single thing.

Work the camera a little bit. Yeah, that!

Hi!
[Youssef gasping]

242
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,672
-How are you?
-[Kanye] Good.

243
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:13,839
I didn't know you were here.

244
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,107
[Kanye] I'm not here. I'm a ghost.

245
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,478
[Kim] I'm so excited for Kourtney to
experience the Givenchy Couture House.

246
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,648
{\an8}-Long hair.
-I know, don't care.

{\an8}[laughter]

248
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,253
To be fitted at Givenchy is, like,
so special.

249
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,688
[Youssef] Where'd Kanye go?

250
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:29,989
[Kim] I don't know where he went.

251
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,023
[Youssef] Oh, he's pulling.

252
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,992
Is that what he's doing? Of course.

253
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,162
[Kim] Kourtney's, like, off and on.
I mean, she went to design school.

254
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,798
But then she's also, like,
very, like, "[bleep] fashion,"

255
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,733
anti-fashion at the same time.

256
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,269
So, I just want to, like, revive her.

257
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,138
I think she just, like, doesn't like to
spend hours and hours getting ready.

258
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,276
I think this with, like, um,
bleached out jean shorts.

259
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,578
-[Kim] And a bra. Yeah.
-And heels.

260
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,747
[Youssef] Cool.

261
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,683
So, wait, did you fly for,
like, twelve hours?

262
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,086
You're kidding?
And then you have a concert, like…

263
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,220
-a day?
-Tomorrow, yeah.

264
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,421
[assistant] Tomorrow?

265
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,689
You could have FaceTimed!

266
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,591
-He could have [bleep] FaceTimed!
-No. Nope.

267
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,126
'Cause you can't see everything
through the FaceTime.

268
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,628
No, because he was like,
"I can't believe you wore those shoes,

269
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,297
I can't believe you wore
that revealing skirt."

270
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,898
Like I… but I sent him a photo.

271
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:13,799
-I feel like that's what…
-I didn't see…

272
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,201
-you would want her to wear…
-…the final, final look, though.

273
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,335
-…when she's 60.
-What upset you?

274
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,770
-The see-through look?
-Yeah.

275
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,938
[Kim] I wore a sheer, vintage Gaultier…

276
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,306
[Youssef] That look where
someone kissed you on the butt?

277
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,340
[Kim] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,077
I mean, you were everything.
Your Instagram, I died.

279
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,748
Stephanie, like, grabbed…
I saw a picture of you grabbing his neck.

280
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,649
No, the guy literally attacked…

281
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,118
like, he's been attacking everyone.

282
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,420
He's the same guy that did
that to me at the Balmain Show.

283
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,823
Oh, I've heard of that guy and I was like,
"No, it can't be the same person."

284
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,693
[Kim] There's this, like,
prankster guy that, two years ago,

285
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,894
did a prank on me

286
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,664
and picked me up, and then yesterday,
we were walking into a restaurant.

287
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,801
I actually didn't even see him
or feel him or knew…

288
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,336
I didn't know anything was going on.

289
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,304
I felt a push from Pascal.

290
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,372
[Stephanie] Hey!

291
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,575
Like, the guy went to go,
either bite my butt or kiss it.

292
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,577
[Kim] And Pascal just tackled him.

293
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,279
[Youssef] Pascal murdered him. R.I.P..

294
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,081
But I didn't feel anything
but a little bump,

295
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,415
so I just was like, "Oh, what?"

296
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,517
It's just a stupid prank,

297
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,387
but it really does get into
your personal space and it's not funny.

298
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,156
You know, I think it's just kind of crazy

299
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,025
that this guy thinks it's okay to do
these pranks on people.

300
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,593
-[Kanye] I was thinking this.
-[Kim] This?

301
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,796
-You have beautiful…
-Yeah, that's different.

302
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,064
-But you got to flex it with those.
-Yeah.

303
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,066
-[Kim] Riccardo has a vision for you.
-[Kourtney] Okay.

304
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,334
[Kim] He wants you to wear a suit.

305
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,770
-Like when he met you at Kris's birthday.
-[Kourtney] Okay.

306
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,071
-[Youssef] You okay with that?
-[Kourtney] Cool. Yeah.

307
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,072
You're in for something,

308
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,174
-let me tell you that!
-I know.

309
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,610
Riccardo Tisci is the designer of Givenchy

310
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,947
and he wants me to be in a black tuxedo

311
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,516
because he loved that look when he met me

312
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,752
at my mom's 60th birthday.

313
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,221
Can I get some lace?

314
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,722
Like, if that was coming…

315
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,227
At home, how I look is just not
a priority.

316
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:52,097
But it's fun to be a Barbie doll
and let everyone dress me

317
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,666
for the couple days that we're here.

318
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,967
What if we…

319
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,902
-Yeah, that's better
-What do you think of that?

320
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,371
{\an8}-Or do you like it more chill?
-[Youssef] No, I agree with you.

321
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,574
{\an8}That's why I was thinking, like,
that kind of lace just…

322
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,741
if there was coming up out of the neck.

323
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,277
[Kanye] If you have that,
then you don't have to hem it.

324
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,980
Or, and what about the earrings?
So, you guys have any…

325
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,815
-[Youssef] The cross ones?
-Yeah.

326
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,552
I don't have the, like,
balls that Kanye does

327
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,621
when it comes to asking designers
for things.

328
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,756
Like, he'll just be like,
"Oh, she needs this coat.

329
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:18,924
Oh, she needs to wear this."

330
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:19,825
[Kanye] Try this on.

331
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:20,826
[Kim] Ooh, I love that.

332
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,796
Like, the long Givenchy peacoat
with the stars in it.

333
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,332
That's, like, a couture piece,
and he's just like,

334
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,300
"She's wearing this.
Like, it is what it is."

335
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,401
What do you guys think?

336
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,203
-With the big velvet choker?
-Yeah.

337
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,271
[Youssef] Okay.

338
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,640
[Kim] Can I be annoying

00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:26,878

683
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,357
[Khloé] I was in Cleveland

684
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,360
when I found out about the robbery.

685
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,697
And so I finally get in touch
with Kourtney,

686
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,165
and I could hear it in her voice,

687
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,801
she's cry-- like,
she's shaking and she's crying,

688
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,202
and she tells me the entire story.

689
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,170
And…

690
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,772
you feel so helpless.

691
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,643
How are you feeling?

692
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,912
Just, like, exhausted.

693
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,847
Emotionally, you're gonna be exhausted,

694
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,115
-I think, for a while.
-[Kim] Yeah.

00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,550

00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,390
{\an8}[Khloé] Hey, babe.

00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,558
[Rob] <i>Hey, Kimbo John.</i>

701
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:17,895
-<i>How you feeling? You calm?</i>
-Yeah, just tired.

702
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,964
[Rob] <i>I just wanted to make sure
you were good.</i>

703
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,566
Thanks for thinking of me.

704
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:22,633

707
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,472
Do you sleep okay at night?

708
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,806
[Kim] Yeah, I sleep fine.

709
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,009
But today I have anxiety,
so I'm, like, ugh.

710
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,111
I hope I just don't start.

711
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,048
But I will say that I think that…

712
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,683
[Khloé] Is it 'cause Kanye's gone?

713
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,151
Maybe I was thinking that.

714
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,423
Kanye's on the road, and, you know,
he's being as supportive as he can,

715
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,291
but he still has to finish his tour,

716
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,128
and it's hard for him,
'cause he wants me to be there with him,

717
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,031
and, you know, it's good that,
you know, my sisters are here

718
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,401
and I have such a big family,
and everyone's just being so supportive.

719
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:01,472
Did they tell you how we had
that conversation, like, that day

720
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,976
about, what would you do, like,
in this situation?

721
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,246
And then Kim was like, "I would tell them,
like, take whatever you want."

722
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,948
Yeah, I was, like, if I get robbed,
if I ever get robbed, I would be like,

723
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,384
"I have everything, take it all,
take it all, I don't care."

724
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,554
[Kourtney] Then Simone wrote me
and was like,

725
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:20,291
"Guys, who's here with Kim? I heard
her say, 'Take whatever you want.'"

726
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,196
So then when I saw that,
I was like, "Pascal."

727
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,066
I, like, ran out of the bathroom,
I was like, "Run to Kim."

728
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,600
Yeah, he was, like, so out of breath.

729
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,903
And I was, like, on the balcony.
I remember, I was, like,

730
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,440
practically naked,
hiding in a bush, on the balcony.

731
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,608
And I'm like, "I think they're gone."

732
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,612
Pascal called the police,
and it was really hard for me

733
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,981
when the police started to show up,
'cause they were dressed

734
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:46,584
in the same uniforms,
except for the face masks.

735
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,254
And so I was just, like, who do I believe?
What's real? Like, what's going on?

736
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:54,225
We waited to do as much police work
as we had to do

737
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,161
and then we flew on a flight home.

738
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,866
I do think it's weird, though, that, like,
25 minutes after, like,

739
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,535
-Jasmine and them left…
-So if you wait across the street…

740
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,671
-They were obviously watching.
-…you can see the lights on

741
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,873
because we're the first floor,
so they must've been told

742
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,241
we were the first floor.

743
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:13,010
-They were definitely watching you.
-They definitely were watching.

744
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,413
So I turned the lights off
and went upstairs.

745
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,648
[dramatic music]

746
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:21,486
What I think happened, now,
after, like, thinking about it so much,

747
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:22,920
is that there was probably

748
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,491
a group of guys that were following us
the entire trip.

749
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,295
{\an8}I was Snapchatting that I was home,

750
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,064
{\an8}and that everyone was going out.

751
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,666
So I think they knew
Pascal was out with Kourtney,

752
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,201
and that I was there by myself.

753
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,804
They had to have known
we were leaving that day.

754
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,409
They had this window of opportunity,
and just went for it.

755
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,846
I was laying in bed, like,
should I wash my face?

756
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,383
I'm so tired, I'm in my robe,
I need to get up, I need to wash my face.

757
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,153
And then ten minutes later,
I was, like, dozing, dozing.

758
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,787
And then I heard pounding up the stairs.

759
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,424
And I thought it was you
and Stephanie, drunk.

760
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,662
I'm calling to them, like,
"Hello, hello? Hello?"

761
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:05,863
And there's no answer.

762
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,335
And then at that moment,
when there wasn't an answer,

763
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,538
my heart started to get really tense,

764
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,340
like, you know, your stomach
just kind of, like, knots up,

765
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,809
and you're, like, okay, what's going on?
What's going on?

766
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,445
I knew something wasn't quite right.

767
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,914
And my door was open like this.

768
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,615
And then I saw…

769
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,853
two guys holding another guy down

770
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,023
in police uniforms,
but right outside of my bedroom,

771
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,357
five feet away.

772
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,194
So I slid off my bed,
and picked up my phone, and I'm like,

773
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,529
I don't know how to call 911
in a different country.

774
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,765
And so I, like, called Pascal,

775
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,833
and then the guy came in,
grabbed the phone from me,

776
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,801
threw me on the bed.

777
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,538
And I was like, this is it.

778
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,577
Then the concierge,
that I realized was the concierge,

779
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,912
'cause he was handcuffed,
with the key to my room.

780
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,517
What I've heard from talking
to him afterwards is they said,

781
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,852
you know, "Where's the rapper's wife?

782
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,955
Like, let us up to her room." Um…

783
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:07,458
In French, so he ended up being
our interpreter.

784
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,361
'Cause I couldn't understand them,
they couldn't understand me.

785
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,432
He was telling me, 'cause when they go,
"Ring, ring, ring."

786
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,300
He goes, "Give them your ring."

787
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,403
Like, "Okay, it's on the table." You know?

788
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,739
And I said, while I'm being tied up,
I'm like,

789
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,809
"Are we going to die?
Are they gonna kill us?"

790
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,145
And I was just, like, crying, and like,

791
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,814
"Tell them I have babies."

792
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,986
They asked for money, I said,
"I don't have any money."

793
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,957
They dragged me out to
the hallway, on top of the stairs.

794
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,327
That's when I saw the gun,
like, clear as day.

795
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,964
And I was, kind of, looking at the gun,

796
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,033
looking down back at the stairs.

797
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,804
And I was, like, I have a split second
in my mind

798
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:57,608
to make this quick decision, like,
am I gonna run down the stairs,

799
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,410
and, like, either be shot in the back,

800
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,046
like, it makes me so upset
to think about it, but, like,

801
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,748
either they're gonna shoot me in the back…

802
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,286
or if I make it and they don't,

803
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,755
if the elevator does not open in time

804
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,424
or the stairs are locked,
then, like, I'm [bleep].

805
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,460
There's no way out.

806
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,632
Then we go back into the room,

807
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:26,570
I remember looking at the concierge,
who was sitting down on this, like, desk.

808
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,172
And I just said, like,

809
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,708
"Are we gonna die?
Like, what's happening to us?

810
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,443
Like, I have babies. Please tell them.

811
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,279
Please, they can't understand me,
but tell them I have babies at home,

812
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,616
like, please, like, I have a family,
like, let me live."

813
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,252
[sentimental music]

814
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,330
[choking up]
And then, um…

815
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:57,101
then he duct-taped my face
and, like, my mouth, to get me to, like,

816
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,137
not yell, or anything,
and then he, like, grabs my legs,

817
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,273
and I wasn't, you know,
I had no clothes on under,

818
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,276
so he pulled me towards him at,
like, the front of the bed,

819
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,144
and I thought, like, okay,
this is the moment.

820
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,245
They're gonna rape me.

821
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,981
And I fully, like,
mentally prepped myself.

822
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:14,352
And then he didn't, and he, like,
duct-taped my legs together,

823
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,419
and…

824
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,656
um, then, you know,
they had the gun up to me,

825
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,391
and I just, like, knew
that was the moment,

826
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,626
they're just totally gonna shoot me
in the head.

827
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:27,732
I just prayed that Kourtney's gonna have
a normal life,

828
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,168
after she sees my dead body on the bed.

829
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,375
I have a family, I have my kids,

830
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,277
like, my husband, my mom, like,

831
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:44,281
I'm not gonna make it out here,
like, I know how these things go.

832
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,819
That was, like, the last thought
and then they picked me up

833
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,188
and put me in the bathroom.

834
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,124
And then ran.

835
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,627
Whatever.

836
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,864
It's all replaceable, none of it matters.

-Whatever happened to that guy?
-I'm getting a restraining order on him.

858
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,713
When I found out that
he had mental health issues,

859
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,881
I was very conflicted.

860
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:27,318
You've got to send him a message
so he won't keep coming back.

861
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,020
You've been through
a really traumatic experience.

862
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,590
You have to make sure
that you get the right help.
