you do that.

[Kendall] He's depressed.

471
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:07,100

that the show has made Rob care

00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:12,733
way more about what other people
think about him, which is not healthy.

473
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,333
[Kim] I think my brother is trying
to hold on to the show

474
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,800
because it's, like, his way
of holding on to Chyna,

475
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:22,866
and it's his way to make Chyna happy,
and it's trying to please someone else,

476
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:25,833

constructive from it,

They just have to experience it themself.

794
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:55,733
[Kim] I really feel like Rob
is taking in what we've been telling him

795
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,066
and that he's just really taking the steps
to better his life.

796
00:41:00,966 --> 00:41:03,466
I just feel bad that we've been,
like, fighting so much

797
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:06,100
just about you and your relationship.

798
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:08,700
And, like, I feel like we just need
to, like, step back.

799
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,733
Obviously, we're here if you ever need us,

800
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,000
but, like, we don't want to, like,
just be involved in your relationship.

801
00:41:15,066 --> 00:41:18,200
{\an8}[Kim] So, I mean, ultimately,
this is, like, up to you.

802
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:20,833
[Rob] I definitely do love her
and want to be with her.

803
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:24,533
And so I'm not gonna just give up.

804
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:27,633
[Kim] <i>Coming up next week...</i>

805
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,433
[Kourtney] Are you excited
to get back out?

806
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,700
[Kim] Am I gonna be nervous
the whole time in Dubai?

807
00:41:31,766 --> 00:41:33,566
Yes. It's not like I'm doing baby steps.

808
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:35,300
It is an international trip.

809
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,766
-[Caitlyn] Kylie?
-[Kendall] I thought she was with you.

810
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:42,133
She's just obsessing over Kylie
and ruining the time we spend together.

811
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,000
-[man] Scott Disick!
-[Kourtney] Scott is still drunk.

812
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:46,700
[Khloe] Scott relapsed?

813
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:48,733
[Kourtney] Should we go bang down
the bathroom door

814
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,233
and see what (bleep) whore is in there?

815
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,866
What the (bleep) are you doing here?
