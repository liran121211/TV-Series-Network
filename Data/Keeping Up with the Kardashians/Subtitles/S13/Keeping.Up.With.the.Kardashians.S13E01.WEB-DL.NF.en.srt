00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,705
You know, we lived here for a little bit,
Kourtney and I.

165
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,107
[Kourtney]
Should we go out on the balcony?

166
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,809
-Did you check out the view?
-No, I literally just got here.

167
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,646
We have such great memories of Miami
and when we come back here,

168
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,849
I feel like we get that same vibe again,

169
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:27,186
where we just want to, like, have fun,
be carefree and, like, be out on the town.

170
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,655
[Kourtney] Should we go do
our old school workouts,

171
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,324
where we would run on the beach?

172
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,959
[Khloé] [bleep] no.
Now if we run on the beach,

173
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,660
paparazzi would run with us.

174
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,863
-That's not as enjoyable as it used to be.
-No.

175
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,232
All right, well,
should we get this show on the road?

176
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,366
Yeah, let's go to dinner.

177
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,636
Excited to talk…

178
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,805
-Hear about your trip to Disney World…
-[Kourtney] A little "Hi, how are you?"

179
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,807
I just haven't heard
about your trip or anything.

180
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:48,875
I know.

181
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,812
Scott and I are, you know, doing our best

182
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,183
to be good parents together
and remain a family,

183
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,885
<i>even though we're not together.</i>

184
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,655
We even stopped in Orlando
and took our kids to Disney World.

185
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,791
-[Scott] All right, let's go.
-[Penelope] Yahoo!

186
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,994
[Kourtney] <i>We've been going
to the beach every day, and, like,</i>

187
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,931
<i>I love just, like, being able to get
to spend time with the kids</i>

188
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,699
and Scott together as a family.

189
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,268
[Scott] Okay. Let's go eat, guys.

190
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,336
[Kourtney] Are you bringing the backpack?

191
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,172
Yeah, it's my bag.

192
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,373
[Kourtney] It's so big.

193
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,542
Just put your phone in your pocket,
what else do you need?

194
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,846
I mean, makeup, charger,
deodorant, money, I.D…

195
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,215
[Khloé] What do you mean what's in it?
What's in your purse?

196
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,250
[upbeat electronic music]

197
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,491
{\an8}-[Khloé] Grutman.
-[Dave] I missed you.

198
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:39,759
{\an8}[Khloé] How are you?

199
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,527
{\an8}-[Kourtney] Long time!
-How are you?

200
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,196
Kourtney, this gonna piss you off?

201
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,230
[Kourtney] Yeah.

202
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,566
What's in there, like, a diaphragm?
What the [bleep] backpack is it?

203
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,402
You guys, it's just my travel backpack.
I came from the airport.

204
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,170
I don't know what you guys want from me.

205
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,574
I'm so excited to eat here.
I've only heard fantastic things.

206
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,843
-The rice, just you wait…
-The rice?

207
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,944
[Kourtney] The forbidden rice.

208
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,545
-Does that…
-[Dave] Oh, the black, no, black rice.

209
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,446
Yeah, black rice.

210
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,714
-I love black things.
-Oh, okay.

211
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,648
[Dave laughs]

212
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,885
Kourt, I saw the Disney pics. was it fun?

213
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,320
[Kourtney] We did 13 hours.

214
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,622
-13 hours?
-[Kourtney] Nonstop, yeah.

215
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,623
With Scott?

216
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,791
And the kids.

217
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,226
And Nor… I brought North and Saint.

218
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,161
-Did they like it?
-[Kourtney] Loved it.

219
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,296
-[man] Okay, what's up.
-Yo!

220
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,699
I got you! Yo, how you feeling tonight?

221
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,801
-[man] Good…
-[Scott] Right, right, right.

222
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:22,869
Yo, you look good.

223
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,370
-What up, girl?
-[Kourtney] What?

224
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,107
[Simon] Wait, Kourt, it's done, right?
Disney World is done?

225
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,308
[Scott and Kourtney] Yes.

226
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,177
[Simon] 13 hours sounds intense.

227
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,278
[Kourtney] He took breaks.

228
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,347
I took, like, two minutes off.

229
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:38,084
Bro, she's very, very thorough,
like CIA-style.

230
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,520
Like, she [bleep] runs,
and she's high-fiving people.

231
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,655
It's [bleep] nuts, man.

232
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,156
[Simon] Were the kids not tired?

233
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,359
[Scott] P was in some mood
at the end of the day.

234
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,960
{\an8}Very similar to somebody.

235
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,395
{\an8}[laughs]

236
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,663
[Scott] I wanted to kill myself.

237
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,499
-[Khloé] Not awkward at all.
-[Scott] But that was a great time!

238
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,134
You should probably have a kid too.

239
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,669
[Simon] Well, you're trying, aren't you?

240
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,571
You expedited things so much.

241
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,974
-Why? What'd you do?
-She spent time with my kids.

242
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,578
I'm sure you helped a lot.
This is the perfect situation.

243
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,514
This is exactly what you want, honey.

244
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,284
Get knocked up and leave your husband.

245
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,019
[laughs]

246
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,522
[Khloé] This is turning
into a really weird dinner, you guys.

247
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,591
-Like, I feel like…
-[Scott] No, it's not at all.

248
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,726
-Are you tired?
-[Kourtney] So tired.

249
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,295
Yeah, you look really shut down.

250
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,897
I really do enjoy hanging out with Scott

251
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,067
with the kids,
because we know what we're doing.

252
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,336
But, like, if we're doing things socially,

253
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,238
<i>I just don't really know how to act.</i>

254
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,341
For so many years,
I've been used to playing a certain role

255
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,410
and having to be responsible

256
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,013
and watching out for his behavior.

257
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,349
<i>He can be
a little bit obnoxious, and, like,</i>

258
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,952
when I'm in Miami,
just trying to have fun with my friends,

259
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,054
I just don't want him to bring me down.

260
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,756
-[Khloé] Kourt, would you ever try duck?
-[Scott] She's tried it a million times.

261
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,293
-[Kourtney] I have tried it.
-[Raul] I brought King here, my son.

262
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,795
And I ordered the duck.

263
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,530
-Yo, bro, he was so mad.
-[Khloé] He hate it?

264
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,265
"Ducks are your friends!"

265
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,800
-[Kourtney and Scott] Aw!
-[all laughing]

266
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,269
-[Scott] That's funny.
-[Kourtney] You should learn from him.

267
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,104
Kids are the future, I swear.

268
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,039
What the [bleep] does that mean?

269
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,208
[Scott] What else could they be?

270
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,443
The past?

271
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,279
[upbeat electronic music]

272
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,619
[Khloé] Hello.

273
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:24,857
That's a cute robe.

274
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,192
[Khloé] I've had this.

275
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,696
The [bleep] do you want?

276
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,199
What the [bleep] is your problem?

277
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,700
Oh, my god. Nothing.

278
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,037
How's Tristan?

279
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,639
[laughs]

280
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,742
-[Khloé] He's good.
-[Kourtney] How was Mexico?

281
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,644
[Khloé] It was so much fun.

282
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,080
When the family was in New York
for Fashion Week,

283
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:52,184
I was in Cabo with a bunch of my friends
and my boyfriend.

284
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,853
<i>His name is Tristan Thompson.</i>

285
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,256
He's a Pisces,
he's Jamaican, from Toronto.

286
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,992
And he plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers.

287
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,627
We just had, like, the best time.

288
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:06,465
But all those paparazzi shots of us,
not one pap I never, ever, ever saw.

289
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:07,800
Ever.

290
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,802
So you didn't know until they came out?

291
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,170
Right. It's horrible.

292
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,705
-Yeah.
-[Khloé] Horrible.

293
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,573
I literally thought, "The coast is clear."

294
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,508
Yeah.

295
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,444
Right now, my relationship is really new,

296
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,880
<i>and I kind of want to keep it close
to my heart</i>

297
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,649
and not, like, really shout everything
from the rooftops,

298
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,918
'cause I think I've learned from the past.

299
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,653
<i>It's just a lot of pressure</i>

300
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,889
<i>to put your relationship out there.</i>

301
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,291
I don't need someone
dissecting Tristan and I.

302
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:37,129
<i>So I'm very choosy
as to who I share my dating life with.</i>

303
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,800
We're all so opinionated,
and we're also, like, an intense family.

304
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,503
And I just feel like I like to, like,
keep things as confined as possible.

305
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,539
No, I think that's a great thing.

306
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,807
It's like, what's the rush?

[Khloé] I haven't seen you in forever.

[Kim] I literally haven't seen you
in 20 years.

You look like Miley Cyrus with that hair.
Not a bad thing.

-[Khloé] I don't want to be Miley. Oh…
-Well, you are Miley Cyrus today.

-What's going on?
-Your hair's so short.

317

I feel like I don't even know you.

318
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,969
My hair? My hair is always short.

319
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,804
[Khloé] Well, unless I put extensions in.

320
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,640
[Kim] So what's been going on?
I saw you went to Mexico.

-Mm-hm.
-Where in Mexico did you go?

322
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,744
I went to Cabo.

00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,312
-[Jonathan] Ha.
-[Kim] Cabo is like…

324

-What?
-And you were just so comfortable

I never saw one paparazzi.
There wasn't one person near us.

like, a whole new crew.

-[Jonathan] A whole new crew.
-[Kim] Who is this crew?

330
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,427
Like, I don't get it.

331
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,595
Just friends.

332
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,932
So I see pictures of Khloé
with some NBA player,

333
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:50,603
<i>and even though I know
not to believe everything on the Internet,</i>

334
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,073
Khloé and an NBA player
do go hand in hand.

335
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,275
<i>So, I mean it's my sister.</i>

336
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,477
Of course I want to know
who she's hooking up with.

337
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,648
What is going on?
You've never revealed information.

338
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,885
Like, it's wild
that I have to see pictures,

339
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,621
like, of you online,
and you don't say one thing.

340
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,057
[Kim] Is this, like, Malika?

341
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,760
-Like, is… Why was Khadijah there?
-Malika was there.

342
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,295
-Like, where was Bobby?
-[Khloé] 'Cause we're on vacation.

343
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,665
Kourtney and I tell each other
literally everything.

344
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,966
<i>'Cause we don't pry too much,</i>

345
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:25,671
until the person decides to reveal
their own personal information.

346
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,742
With Kim, this is what, like,
makes Kim horny in life, is, like,

347
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,012
finding out all these details
and just salivating at the mouth,

348
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,647
asking me all these questions.

349
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,816
So, we all know to not tell Kim anything,

350
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,952
unless we want to tell her
every last detail.

351
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,053
You're making me crazy.

352
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,322
[Jonathan laughs]
It's the hair, the whole thing.

353
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,657
-[Kim] I know.
-What?

354
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,258
I gotta change my hair?

356
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,769
[Kim and Khloé speak in English accent]
Hello!

357
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,772
[in normal accent]
Everyone's into really short these days.

358
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,741
No. I've never bought
a XXL that's this short.

359
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,076
It's the type of the shirt.

360
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,078
-[Khloé] 'Cause my army one is way longer.
-Yeah.

361
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,280
Why does his fit different
than the last ones?

362
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,281
[Kim] I don't know.

363
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,783
We will tell Mr. West.

364
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,284
Good thing we know the designer.

365
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,485
Don't tell him I said that.

366
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:17,690
Um, so you said DASH was just, like,
the New York one is just so not like L.A.

367
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,258
I just want it to look different.

368
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,795
I think it needs to update.
It doesn't need to be, like, glam.

369
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,863
-Yeah.
-[Kourtney] Like, I cannot wait

370
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,030
to go to DASH here.

371
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,832
Let's step it up. Let's do streetwear.

372
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,302
But so, I've been talking to Mom,

373
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,405
and this major department store
wants to buy DASH

374
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,842
and put a DASH store in each one
of their huge department stores.

375
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,677
That would be so cool.

376
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,013
It's such a smart idea,

377
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,884
because it will give us a chance
to finally evolve and move on.

378
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,719
We've had this store for a decade.

379
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,656
And I've already been, like,
I'm vetoing my sisters,

380
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,959
and I'm saying yes,
and Mom's flying in to New York.

381
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,362
-I'm on the same page.
-[Kim] I know you will. That's why I knew.

382
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,696
It wasn't, like, a big thing.

383
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,131
I'm, like, let's just…

384
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,166
Like, who cares about the stores?

385
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,868
[Kourtney] I do. I care about them.

386
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,436
[Khloé] I don't give a [bleep].

387
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,804
-We're overriding you, honey.
-[Kourtney] No.

388
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,707

[Kim] <i>I don't get it.</i>

00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,344
Kourtney was ranting to me

391
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,147
about how New York was such a hot mess.

392
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,715
And this is the best opportunity

393
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,485
for the store, for us, for everything.

394
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,488
Does she have time to go in every day?
I don't think so.

395
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,924
-This is such a huge opportunity.
-No, but all the things we kept saying,

396
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,593
"Let's wait, let's wait, let's wait,"
finally just got to the point…

397
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,828
[Kim] I know,
but let's just see the store first

398
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,064
and what the deal is,
and we'll go from there.

-Yep, this was home.
-…that we lived in.

402
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,544
[Kourtney] Once, I stayed here,

403
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,347
it was New Year's Eve,
and Courtenay Semel was like,

404
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,815
"You've got to come with me."

405
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,384
Like, all I had was, like, money
for, like, the flight.

406
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,120
I was like, "Courtenay, I have,
like, 60 dollars or something."

407
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,189
And we're like, "A bagel's 60 cents.

408
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,725
-We'll just eat bagels the whole time."

-[Simon] Steph's dinner.

-[Jonathan] Is Scott coming?
-No, Steph's birthday dinner.

-So he's not invited.
-So he doesn't care?

Oh, he's not invited. It's like that?

-They don't even know each other.

everywhere that we go?

-[Simon] Yeah.
-I was just curious.

and be able to go
to my friend's birthday dinner

427
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,002

without him being there

[Jonathan] Is that what you do,

00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,638
No, repenting is Catholic, isn't it?

-[Jonathan] On my life.

And she's like, "Okay."

-Right. She's like a little puppy.

that we need to close these stores,

Should we just give these away

I can't, I can't.

653
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,480
[Kourtney] I can impersonate someone.

654
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,815
[in Spanish accent]
My name is Inigo Montoya.

655
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,150
You killed my father.

656
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,919
[Jonathan speaks in normal accent]
Uh-oh, never mind.

657
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,954
With those kind of accents, don't do it.

658
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,856
[all laughing]

659
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,891
[Kim] Scott is texting me.

660
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,561
[Kourtney]
Just don't tell him what we're doing.

661
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,897
[Khloé] Wait, he just texted me too.

662
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,166
[Kourtney] Like, why?
Isn't that so annoying?

663
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,301
[Jonathan] I can't.

664
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,769
[Khloé] <i>You know, I totally get it.</i>

665
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:14,039
Kourt and Scott aren't together,
but it has to be hard.

666
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,607
They have all the same friends.

667
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,842
<i>It just blurs a lot of lines.</i>

668
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,411
<i>We don't know
what we're allowed to invite him to,</i>

669
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,946
<i>what we're not allowed to invite him to.</i>

670
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,248
<i>And it's like,
I don't want to be lying to Scott.</i>

671
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,817
It's a weird, [bleep] up situation.

672
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,919
Not just for me,
for everyone at the table.

673
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,387
[Jonathan] Oh, boy.

674
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,457
Oh, my god, I'm dying.

675
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,426
[upbeat electronic music]

676
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,398
[Kim] What is this water jug?

677
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,800
Water hydrates your body.

678
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,136
[Kim] I know, but, like, how crazy for you
to carry around a big jug.

679
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,672
So I suffer the curse of camel toe.

680
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:51,443
Like, don't you know by now
that camel toe is not a curse?

681
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,946
[Khloé] So, you are being a bump on a log.

682
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,315
Do you want to take over DASH on your own?

683
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,351
Why? Why wouldn't you
just want to all do it?

684
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,388
We're about to be making moves.

685
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,322
How? Tell me when.

686
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,492
We're building an app
so people can shop online.

687
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,394
I'm doing a full revamp.

688
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,796
How long is this gonna take, four years?

689
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,132
Yeah, you move like a [bleep] slug.

690
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,868
I don't think we should close DASH Miami.

691
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,770
[Khloé scoffing]
Then you're an idiot.

692
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,141
I think it is a blessing from God

693
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,844
that a huge department store
wants to buy DASH.

694
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,145
<i>That was our end goal,</i>

695
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,515
and Kourtney just can't [bleep] go
with the [bleep] flow.

696
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,616
I don't get it.

697
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,953
Like she wants to be at DASH every day.

698
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,556
<i>It's laughable 'cause she's the last one
to do any sort of hard labor.</i>

699
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,792
She wants to live in Nantucket

700
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,861
with her kids and a horse and carriage.

701
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,196
What are we doing now?

702
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,632
What profit do we make?
What this or that? Nothing.

703
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,668
It's not always about money.

704
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:53,104
But I'm saying just wait, let's figure out
what it is without you being, like,

705
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,507
"I don't know.
I don't know if I want to do it."

706
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,542
For real, what the [bleep]
we're doing now is what?

707
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,977
-Getting started.
-What you just said…

708
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,111
Getting started?

709
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:04,649
We've had the [bleep] store
for four million years, literally!

710
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,051
[Khloé] Are you [bleep] on drugs?

711
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,053
You're complaining
about tile on the floor.

712
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,221
You can't even do
the [bleep] buying on time!

713
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,623
It's ridiculous.

714
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,857
-[Khloé] We're getting rid of the store.
-We've worked so hard

715
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,125
to get to this place.

716
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:18,596
I don't like that my sisters feel like

717
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:21,633
they're just ready to let go of DASH
so easily.

718
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,737
I just really think that our stores are
more than just a business.

719
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:30,208
How dare you really try to argue us
on getting rid of the [bleep] stores.

720
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,711
We're getting rid of the stores, Kourtney!

721
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,981
{\an8}[upbeat music]

722
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,624
[Kim] Smell this out of the bottle.

723
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,626
I want a gardenia scent.

724
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,464
Smells like pure throw-up.

725
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,365
[laughing]
Like, legit.

726
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,602
Wait, it really does. That's so weird.

727
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,941
Um, I just wanted to talk to you
about this whole DASH situation.

728
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,945
I know that, like, you don't care as much
about the stores anymore.

729
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:11,015
But I just, I don't know,
I feel like it's, like, sentimental.

730
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,685
[Kourtney] After Dad passed away,

731
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,856
having DASH really gave us something
to do together as sisters

732
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,591
and kept us together.

733
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,861
-[Kim] Yeah.
-And so, I just feel like

734
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,130
as long as we get our merchandising down,

735
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:28,666
we should definitely keep our stores,

736
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,268
100 percent.

737
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,640
I mean, I haven't really been,
like, thinking about

738
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:38,843
why you've been fighting so hard
to keep it and, like, now I kind of get it

739
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,112
and it makes sense.

740
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,782
From a business standpoint,

741
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,584
sometimes it's easy to forget
that, like, you know,

742
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,520
the DASH stores are really sentimental.

743
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,989
You know, it's been a long road for us.

744
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,925
<i>I do wish Kourtney would look at it
a little bit differently,</i>

745
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,694
but I'll try really hard to look at it
from her point of view

746
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,497
and really understand how she feels.

747
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,567
I think you should just be,
like, open to other options.

748
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,068
Yeah, I am.

749
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:08,039
Um, Scott texted me that he didn't want
to come to the concert tonight,

750
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,642
just because he wanted
to give you your space.

751
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,377
I feel like he's, like,
shutting himself off

752
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:16,147
because he doesn't want to feel
like he's stepping on your toes.

753
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,849
And I feel bad.

754
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,552
No, you can't feel bad for him.

755
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:24,222
He's invited to everything.
Like, I can't breathe.

756
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,158
I get it, but you can't change what you do

757
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,727
when he's there, so you just just have to,
like, live your life.

758
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:30,962
He lived his life.

759
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:35,433
I mean, I definitely don't want to have,
like, a <i>Mean Girls </i>situation

760
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,869
and feel like
I'm trying to not include Scott

761
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:38,970
<i>and hurt his feelings.</i>

762
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,738
I feel like you should call him
and be like,

763
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,374
"Look, we're all going to the concert.
Don't be ridiculous.

764
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,375
Of course you're invited."

765
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:50,215
Maybe I can try to not let him
affect my mood and see how it goes.

I definitely want to go to the concert,</i>

with all your friends,</i>

{\an8}-[Fat Joe] You did?
-[Jonathan] Did you?

Hey, don't, Khlo!
[screams]

984
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,516
[Kim] <i>I guess at the end of the day,</i>

985
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,118
<i>it just makes so much sense
to close the New York store</i>

986
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,653
<i>'cause rent is so expensive.</i>

987
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,922
<i>But with Miami, I think we're gonna find</i>

988
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,291
a really good team
that we feel comfortable with,

989
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,661
and pay attention more
and put more effort and time into it,

990
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,363
which I think we're all willing to do.

991
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,132
[Kris] I'm really glad
you guys are gonna keep DASH.

992
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,534
Makes me really happy.

993
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,769
It's really your roots

994
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:42,106
and how you guys got started
in fashion in 2004…

995
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,308
Oh, I remember it.

996
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,709
Let's reminisce.

997
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,712
[Kris] That was some of the best years
of our lives, you guys.

998
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,714
[Kourtney]
I used to give everyone Zipfizz.

999
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,882
Do you remember that stuff?

1000
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,884
You pour it in your water
and I would shake it

1001
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,386
and I would make them for everyone
and I would go,

1002
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,121
"Let's start vacuuming."

1003
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,023
We would be going nuts.

1004
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,358
Kourtney and I cleaned both stores.

1005
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,294
[Khloé] We never ate one time.

1006
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,431
And we did inventory, cleaned the stores,
did the whole back rooms,

1007
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,400
{\an8}and we had, like, the best day.

1008
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,569
{\an8}And I was like,
"Y'all, I don't know what you gave me,

1009
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,504
{\an8}that was literally the craziest thing."

1010
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,905
[chuckles softly]

1011
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,407
[slurps]

1012
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,610
It's really hard to drink with a lip ring.
[scoffs]

1013
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,345
[Kim] <i>Coming up next week…</i>

1014
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,513
Bonjour!

1015
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,316
Oh, my god, I cannot believe
we're at Paris Fashion Week.

1016
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,885
Givenchy, here we come.

1017
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:31,155
I can't believe this is the first time
Kourtney's seen me walk.

1018
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,122
[applause]

1019
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,191
[dispatcher speaks in French over phone]
2-1-1 speaking, good evening.

1020
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,793
What is your emergency?

1021
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,497
I just said, "Please, I have a family.
Like, let me live."

1022
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,098
Either they're gonna shoot me in the back

1023
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,467
or if the elevator does not open in time,

1024
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,903
I'm [bleep]. There's no way out.
