I would say a good leg and a bodysuit.

I want everybody
to be on good terms with me.

481
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,200
I just can't be selfish
and just always shut myself out if--

482
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:41,333
even if I get into an argument,
I can't let that just affect me

483
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,466

like I did in the past.

-[Khloe] Over what?

798
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,100
[Kim] After everything I went through,
the surgery, like, was not successful.

799
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,133
And it didn't do anything.

800
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,566
[Khloe] I mean, I already told you
from the start: it kind of scares me.

801
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:44,066
Like, your pregnancies are
really hardcore.

802
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:45,066
[Kim] Yeah.

803
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:48,700
But after Paris, I just feel
like there's this-- just, like,

804
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,600
needing feeling to bring another soul
into my life.

805
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:54,733
[Khloe] How does Kanye feel about this?

806
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,633
[Kim] Kanye was really just,
like, nervous about the surgery.

807
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,733
He's just glad that it's, like,
over and I'm fine.

808
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,633
But I just know that, like,
he would want to have more kids.

809
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,233
So, I think that Kanye and I
are just gonna look into other options

810
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,000
and see what we're comfortable with.

811
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:13,666
[Kourtney] Do you want to do a surrogate
or you're not sure?

812
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,966
{\an8}[Kim] So, I think that Kanye and I
are just gonna look into other options

813
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:24,966
and see what we're comfortable with.

814
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:27,766
[Kourtney] Do you want to do a surrogate
or you're not sure?

815
00:38:29,966 --> 00:38:33,333
[Kim] I'm definitely leaning more towards,
like, I want to try.

816
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:41,100
After talking with Kanye, I think that
I always knew surrogacy was an option,

817
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,666
but I didn't think it was that realistic
of an option.

818
00:38:43,733 --> 00:38:46,533
Now, I feel like that's my reality.

819
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,800
I feel like surrogacy really is
the only other option for me.

820
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,333
It's so frustrating.

821
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,800
[Kourtney] I'm sorry.

822
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,933
I feel really bad
that you're dealing with all this.

823
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,833
[Kim] Yeah.

824
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,733
[Khloe] It's good that Kanye
is so supportive

825
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,533
and I feel like you have a good head
on your shoulders about it.

826
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,033
[Kim] Yeah. It's just, like,
whatever's meant to be will be.

827
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,066
[Kourtney] Yeah.

828
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,733
♪ ♪

829
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,466
{\an8}[Scott] All black and a velvet
bomber out here?

830
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:28,500
It's 90, 100 degrees out.
You must be super cozy.

831
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:31,866
-[Kris] Hey, Rob.
-[Scott] Ow!

832
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:34,366
-[Khloe] The Bobster.
-[Kris] Hi, babe.

833
00:39:34,966 --> 00:39:37,533
-You look good.
[Rob] Mom, your wig's falling off now.

834
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,900
[Scott laughs]

835
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,733
[Kris] How excited are you, Khloe?

836
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,466
-[Khloe] With what?
-[Kris] With the brand.

837
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:46,466
[Khloe] What about it?

838
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:50,333
[Kris] Um, it's only, like,
the second biggest launch

839
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,600
Nordstrom's has ever had
in the history of the store.

840
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,166
-[Rob] What?
-[Kris] And it sold out everywhere.

841
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:59,900
[Khloe] I just wanted you
to tell Scott. [laughs]

842
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:01,566
[Scott laughs mockingly]

843
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,400
-[Kris] Exciting, huh?
-[Scott] Unbelievable.

844
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:05,400
-[Khloe] Don't leave me hanging.
-[Rob] Amazing.

845
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:07,100
[Khloe squealing] Do you want to be in it?

846
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,833
-[Rob chuckles]
-[Kris] It's so great

847
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,466
and Khloe was so nervous.

848
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,166
[Khloe] It's so intimidating. The Grove?

849
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:14,600
[Scott] I'm-- I'm afraid of that.

850
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,866
[Khloe] I have been getting updates
all day long

851
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:21,366
about sales and we did astronomical.

852
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:24,133
I have no words to express my gratitude.

853
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,966
And for me to be speechless,
you know that's a big deal.

854
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:30,166
It's a testament to when you do things
you're passionate about,

855
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:32,233
then this is our reward for that.

856
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,200
And that's all I care to put back
into the universe.

857
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,766
[Scott] Obviously, a jean business
would be huge for her, no pun intended.

858
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:39,766
[Khloe chuckles]

859
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:42,733
Why don't we do a jean line for Rob
called Good Armenian?

860
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,566
-[Rob laughs]
-[Khloe] Good Armenian.

861
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:46,566
[Scott] And make it super hairy.

862
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:49,466
[Kris] Wait, you have a hole in your pants
and I can see your do-do.

863
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,966
[Scott] I'll cover it up, sorry.

864
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,800
[Kris] That's wild, Khloe.
I'm so proud of you. Aren't you excited?

865
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:58,033
[Khloe] No, you can't just go from
Scott's (bleep) getting out of his pants

866
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,066
to saying that.

867
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:01,966
[Scott] Well, they're both jeans
and they're both coming out parties.

868
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:03,800
-[Kris laughs]
-[Khloe] True.

869
00:41:03,866 --> 00:41:05,766
{\an8}[Kris] This family's really crazy.

870
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,500
{\an8}[Khloe] Well, Mom, your
ex-husband's a girl. Let's not go there.

871
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,033
[Rob and Scott laugh]

872
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,866
-[Kris] Wow.
-[Khloe] Bada boom, bada bing.

873
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:14,333
[laughs]

874
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,866
[Kim] <i>Coming up next week...</i>

875
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,133
-[Scott] She's the love of my life.
-[Khloe] It seems like

876
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,166
-you're working things out.
-[Kourtney] We're not.

877
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:21,900
[Khloe] Scott thinks you are.

878
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:24,400
[Scott] I'm getting out of here.
This trip was worthless.

879
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:28,033
[Khloe] Bruce and I were incredibly close,
but I don't know Caitlyn.

880
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,566
How Cait handled her transition
hurt a lot of people.

881
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:33,333
[Caitlyn] We certainly have grown apart.

882
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,900
[Kim] Kanye walked offstage last night.

883
00:41:35,966 --> 00:41:38,400
[Kim] I get a call and my heart drops.

884
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:39,600
What's going on?

885
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:41,333
[sobbing] I can't.
