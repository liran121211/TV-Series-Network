1
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,238
hey, man, I think it's about
 time we haul it up out of here.

2
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,273
Yeah, might be.

3
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,109
Let me finish this first.

4
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,948
it's a nice night, though.

5
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,617
It's quiet.

6
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,752
A little too quiet.

7
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,855
This place always gave me
    the heebie-jeebies, man.

8
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:00,025
This water's so murky.

9
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,794
It's shit water.

10
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,230
I almost drowned in it once
     when I was like eight.

11
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:08,367
Actually, right over there
          by the beach.

12
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,436
My cousin had to drag me out.

13
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,739
I don't know what it was, man.

14
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:16,575
I just felt like
       I was being pulled.

15
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,379
You probably was.

16
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,415
By what?

17
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,553
There's a whole town
         underneath us.

18
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:30,022
The hell out of here, man.

19
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:32,591
That's what I'm saying.

20
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,726
Shit water.

21
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,262
This whole lake
       used to be a town.

22
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,264
Houses, barns, roads.

23
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,433
There's a whole raceway
           down there.

24
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,503
State government built a dam
     and flooded the place.

25
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,905
Anyone who didn't leave drowned.

26
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:52,344
Town was black, too.

27
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,645
What?

28
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:57,049
Self-governed black town.

29
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:04,389
so, there are black people
       under us right now?

30
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,993
Yeah. Why you think
       so many people die

31
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,628
around here every year?

32
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,432
'cause of drunk rednecks
    trying to fish at night.

33
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,967
Like you.

34
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,173
no.

35
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,842
It's 'cause it's haunted.

36
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,782
you-you really think
          it's haunted?

37
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,685
Oh, yeah.

38
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,755
Lot of souls down there.

39
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,857
That's what pulled you under.

40
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,626
Town full of black folk.

41
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,395
They were almost white.

42
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,697
Get the hell out of here, man.
   What are you talking about?

43
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,667
They were almost white?

44
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,004
White's not a real thing, right?

45
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,875
There's no scientific basis
             for it.

46
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,345
People just... Become white.

47
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,281
It's social.

48
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,120
White is where you are.

49
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,455
It's when you are.

50
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,993
Armenians are white as hell
        till they ain't.

51
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,131
Armenians?

52
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,002
When they dammed
       the chattahoochee,

53
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,238
some refused to leave.

54
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,042
They thought they were safe.

55
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:35,013
They'd paid to be white.

56
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,318
With enough blood and money,
      anyone can be white.

57
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,021
It's always been that way.

58
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,294
But the thing about
         being white is

59
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,163
it blinds you.

60
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,267
It's easy to see
     the black man as cursed

61
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,704
because you've separated
       yourself from him.

62
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,841
But you don't know...

63
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,677
You're enslaved just like him.

64
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,882
Cold whiteness.

65
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,853
You're hypothermic.

66
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,356
You lose logic.

67
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,792
You see the blood...

68
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,430
...And you think
    someone else is bleeding.

69
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:33,372
Everyone is screaming at you
    to turn the machine off,

70
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,507
but you can't hear them.

71
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,545
you can't even
      hear yourself saying,

72
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,681
"we're cursed, too."

73
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,817
We're cursed, too!

74
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,655
Oh, shit!

75
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,430
mrs. Connor:
      I don't want to keep
    reminding you about this.

76
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,198
Oh, and one more thing
 before we go.

77
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,867
listen up, everyone.

78
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,503
I have a special announcement
            to make.

79
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,505
In an effort
  to promote more black history

80
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,508
in the curriculum,
   our school has partnered up

81
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,344
with the atlanta falcons
       and domino's pizza

82
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,945
for the
   change atlanta initiative.

83
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:18,183
So, next Thursday,
we're all going on a field trip.

84
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,919
We're all going
      to go watch a movie.

85
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,656
The new black panther 2.

86
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,992
- Let's go!
- -mrs. Connor: I know. Okay.

87
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,560
I know. It's exciting...

88
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,329
-Oh.
   -Mrs. Connor: Loquareeous.

89
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,798
Students:
   Hey! Hey! Hey!

90
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,866
-Loquareeous, sit down!
           -Hey! Hey!

91
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,435
Loquareeous!

92
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,337
loquareeous, sit down right now!

93
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,939
hey! Hey!

94
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,176
Loquareeous, sit down right now,
           young man!

95
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,113
Principal miller:
            Hi, mom.

96
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,182
Please. Come in and have a seat.

97
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:51,983
Mom:
             Mm-hmm.

98
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,852
How's everyone doing today?

99
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,854
First of all,

100
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,724
I done already told y'all
  to stop calling me down here.

101
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,693
Well, I really appreciate you
     coming down, ms. Reid.

102
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,863
And you're loquareeous's
       grandfather, right?

103
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,865
Thank you both for coming.

104
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,035
As you know,
     there was a disruption

105
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,537
-with loquareeous...
    -Uh, let me jump in here.

106
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,140
Sorry. Uh, I'm the guidance
     counselor, mrs. Grier.

107
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,543
Let me start by saying
   I am a big fan of your son.

108
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,545
He's been
    to my office a few times

109
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,547
already this semester
   for disciplinary problems--

110
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,049
talking in class,
       being disruptive...

111
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,852
-Well, then give him detention.
           -Well, yes.

112
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,254
He's-he's had detention before.

113
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,856
Several times.

114
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,557
But I-I had a thought.

115
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,593
Maybe the reason that he's being
       disruptive in class

116
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,228
is because the material
       is too challenging.

117
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,662
If we put him in remedial math

118
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,064
and language arts,
      he could have the...

119
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,899
Wait. Wait.

120
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,034
What? No.

121
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:46,171
-My son is not dumb.
          -Oh, no, no.

122
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,340
He's an idiot.
        Y'all ridiculous.

123
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,242
He is not the first kid
       to act up in class,

124
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,144
and you want to push him back
          some grades?

125
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,612
No, I just thought
         it could be...

126
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,213
Don't you move my son.

127
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,783
Tell his teachers
     to give him detention.

128
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,886
-Miller: Thank you for coming.
            -Mm-hmm.

129
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,157
Okay, that went very well.

130
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,427
Grier:
    I thought I... I-I think
   he could really use the...

131
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,895
Ms. Reid?

132
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,563
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,799
mom:
    Uh-uh! You better dance!

134
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,801
Since you love to dance so much,
            go 'head.

135
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,236
Shoot it. Come on, shoot!

136
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,472
You got these people up here
     thinking you retarded.

137
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,241
Your ass gonna end up
      in them sped classes.

138
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,676
Now whip.

139
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,311
Mm-hmm.

140
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,746
Nae nae. Come on.

141
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,582
Ay. Ay. Ay.

142
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,984
Hit it. Hit it!

143
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,255
If you don't start using your
 common sense and acting right,

144
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,824
these white people--
       they gon' kill you.

145
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,593
-Ms. Reid, d...
          -Kill... You.

146
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,328
-Now do the worm.
         -Grier: Really,
    there's no need for that.

147
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,096
-Let's see it.
   -There's no need for that.

148
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,002
You up here showing out
   for your white classmates.

149
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,637
Yeah,
   you laughing with them now,

150
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,506
but they're gonna be
     the only ones laughing

151
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,741
when you dead or in jail.

152
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,312
I wasn't even trying
         to show out...

153
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,247
I don't want to hear it!

154
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,793
-What's your problem?
       -Now get to class.

155
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,662
And I better not get
 another call from this school.

156
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,998
I'll walk him back.

157
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,535
Don't worry.

158
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,804
I'm gonna get you out of there.

159
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,819
mom, there ain't no more milk!

160
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:44,856
Mom:
      There's spaghetti in
 the refrigerator if you hungry.

161
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,907
mom:
        You better not be
        watching that tv.

162
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,042
I'm-a check, and I'll know.

163
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,888
hello. Ms. Reid, right?

164
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,823
Who wants to know?

165
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,259
I'm with family
    and children's services.

166
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,261
I'm here on behalf of the city
   to conduct a welfare ch...

167
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,031
-Family and children's services?
          -Yes, ma'am.

168
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,600
I'm here to conduct
 a welfare check on your son...

169
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,602
-Loqua...
          -Loquareeous!

170
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,071
-Oh, yes.
      -Loquareeous: Uh-huh.
          -Get in here!

171
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,575
-See, y'all got me fucked up.
  -Oh, ma'am, I just need a few

172
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,710
-moments to speak with you.
 -Did you call the police on me?

173
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,879
-No.
         -Oh, ms. Reid,

174
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,280
the police are just here
        as a precaution.

175
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,249
Take him.

176
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,117
Go ahead.

177
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,053
-Ma.
         -Since you want
       to go so bad, bye.

178
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,888
Ma, I didn't call nobody.

179
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,390
- You know what?
- wait.

180
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,025
Mom.

181
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,430
Mama, I didn't call nobody.

182
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,966
I ain't giving you
all these clothes that I bought.

183
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,601
Grandpa:
   Y'all better take this boy

184
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,302
-fore I kill him...
              -Mom.

185
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,706
...And he got a real reason
to call the police.

186
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,074
mom.

187
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,508
Mama, wait!

188
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,551
oh, my goodness.

189
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,125
welcome home, son. Okay.

190
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,793
Quickly, get inside.

191
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,662
Thank you so much
   for doing this last minute.

192
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,563
We always appreciate it, amber.

193
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,132
Amber:
 Oh, it's not a problem at all.

194
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,867
It's what we do.

195
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,969
All right, well,
     let's get you settled.

196
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:15,540
I am amber,
   but you can call me "mom."

197
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,976
um, oh, those are
 your new brothers and sisters.

198
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,946
That's lanre, yves and fatima.

199
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,383
Ugh. It's stinky here.

200
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,053
Amber:
   Oh, no, no, no,
  it doesn't stink.

201
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,355
Come on, this way.

202
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,957
We've kind of turned our kitchen
        into a workshop.

203
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,360
We're trying to make
      an olive oil shampoo,

204
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,563
and we started mixing together
     some african dudu soap.

205
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:41,199
It's not what it sounds like.

206
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,135
We make our own kombucha.
           Yummy, huh?

207
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:48,440
And we pickle our own veggies
    using our organic garden.

208
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,475
Um, we're selling it
 at the farmers market tomorrow.

209
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,744
You're gonna love it.

210
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,113
Oh, um, and that is
         your other mom.

211
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,315
And that little guy is cornpop.

212
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,184
Welcome to the family.

213
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,422
So do I call you both "mom"?

214
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,325
- Yes.
- call me gayle.

215
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,430
oh, dinner's at 5:30,
        so wash up first.

216
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,566
Um, we're having fried chicken.

217
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,302
And, um, since it's your first
   night, I'll let you decide.

218
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,404
Do you want capers or sprouts?

219
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,239
I don't know what that is.

220
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,241
aw.

221
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,310
capers it is.

222
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,046
-oh, will you get me
    that chicken over there?
            -Mm. Mm.

223
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,718
Amber:
            Perfect.

224
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,456
Uh, how much
     did we do it last time?

225
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,258
-12 minutes is too long, right?
             -Yeah.

226
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,261
-It was a little dry.
         -Okay, let's do
     eight and a half, then.

227
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,596
Gayle:
             Mm-hmm.

228
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,621
amber:
              Hey.

229
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:14,125
I just wanted to see
    that you were settled in.

230
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:21,266
I made you something special
       for your first day.

231
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,872
This says "larry."

232
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,376
oh, well, I didn't know
 how to spell "loo-kway-reeous,"

233
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,378
so I figured
     we'd call you "larry."

234
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,048
larry's a great nickname. Hmm.

235
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,317
Um, where's the washcloth?

236
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,755
It's okay. He's new here.

237
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:47,192
You just use your hands.

238
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,827
Even on my butt?

239
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,597
Oh, we need to take a picture.

240
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,199
Get around.

241
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,635
Get the towel.
         Get the towel.

242
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,772
Okay.

243
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,740
perfect!

244
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,217
what are you wearing?

245
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,852
Pajamas.

246
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,386
Amber:
   You can wear that tonight,

247
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,689
but from now,
   I'll lay your clothes out.

248
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,895
You can sprinkle
some rosemary on it if you want.

249
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,364
Mm-mm. Mmm. It's great.

250
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,899
Mmm.

251
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,237
Larry, you're not eating.

252
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,239
This food is nasty.

253
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,040
If I eat it, I'll throw up.

254
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,911
Larry, we do not say
    "throw up" at the table.

255
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,746
But it's nasty.

256
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:45,450
No, honey.
    It's just better for you.

257
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,319
There's too much salt and oil
      in most of the foods

258
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,221
that you're used to.

259
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,926
Oh, did you see
       on instagram today

260
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,896
that rihanna used the phrase
        "spirit animal"?

261
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,297
Gayle:
           No. Please.

262
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,399
Please tell me that rihanna
     is an indigenous person

263
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,967
-and I just don't know it.
             -Uh-uh.

264
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,739
oh, my god. We got to comment
         on that, right?

265
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,212
gayle:
               Mm.

266
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,453
gayle:
             Hello.

267
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,821
This is she.

268
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,957
We're having dinner.

269
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,484
gayle:
       I don't understand
     why the bill collectors

270
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,186
are always
   just calling during dinner.

271
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,989
-I put us on that
       "do not call" list.
     -Well, they're calling.

272
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,390
This food is nasty!

273
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,659
Larry, we don't...

274
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,195
you want to know something?

275
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,166
There are starving children
           in africa.

276
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,968
You don't believe me,
        ask your brother.

277
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,137
I want a hamburger.

278
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,173
we don't have hamburgers.

279
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,641
That's what the dog is eating.

280
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,711
Well, yeah,
that's cornpop's food.

281
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,347
you don't..? Okay, you don't
 want to eat, you can go to bed.

282
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,482
-It's 6:00!
             -Okay.

283
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,851
Man, I hate this house!

284
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,987
gayle:
      We don't use the word
      "hate" in this house.

285
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,122
Loquareeous:
     Hate, hate, hate, hate,
     hate, hate, hate, hate!

286
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,591
gayle:
      So, this is the last

287
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,726
that marcos can give us
           on credit.

288
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:14,365
Hey. We're gonna have to make
     some more adjustments.

289
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,374
we didn't eat lunch.

290
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:27,145
You had celery and carrots,
            remember?

291
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,446
I'm still hungry.

292
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,448
You're supposed to be hungry.

293
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,084
If you're full,
  that means you ate too much.

294
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,258
How much longer
     do we have to do this?

295
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,261
Why don't you try
 singing a song while you work?

296
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,063
It might make you feel better.

297
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,472
Sing something silly,
           like, um...

298
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,756
okay, back to work, larry.

299
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:15,126
We got to leave for the
  farmers market in 30 minutes.

300
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,873
woman:
 oh, your family's so cute.

301
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,110
Amber:
 Oh, thank you so much.

302
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,112
larry,
   can you put some effort in?

303
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:36,647
Shake your booty. Come on.

304
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,284
Man:
    Aw. Is hugs your father?

305
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,221
No.

306
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,663
-Larry.
           -Whoa. Oh.

307
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,737
-Whoa! Kid, I almost shot you!
      -I learned my lesson.

308
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,939
I hate my new parents.
        They can't cook,

309
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,774
-and they make me sleep
      in a storage closet.
           -All right.

310
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,711
Slow down.
   Y... Your parents did this?

311
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,113
My moms.
 They make me do all the chores,

312
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,549
and I didn't eat nothing.
      Please take me home.

313
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,551
-I'm tired
     of these white ladies.
     -All right, calm down.

314
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,852
-I don't know
     what you're talking...
      -Excuse me, officer.

315
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,220
Is there a problem?

316
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,723
Um, that's our son.

317
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,192
-This is your son?
              -Yes.

318
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,896
Yeah. My wife, amber and I--
 we adopt impoverished children.

319
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,898
We have a kombucha stand
        right over there.

320
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,866
Did you want some?

321
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,104
Oh. I see what's going on.

322
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,439
Okay. I think
     he's just tired is all.

323
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,008
He said he wanted to go home.

324
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,509
Maybe he thought I'd arrest you

325
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,511
for not letting him
 play playstation.

326
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,480
uh, well,

327
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,649
all four of our children
     are black, so we always

328
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,418
make sure to tell them that
  the police are their friends.

329
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,053
Yeah.

330
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,723
-come on.
              -Hey.

331
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,294
You know who he reminds me of
          in that hat?

332
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,795
Aloe blacc.

333
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,897
-Yes. Exactly.
             -Yeah.

334
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,600
thank you so much.

335
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,735
-Come on.
            -Come on.

336
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:13,828
larry, you are helping so much.
      I'm so proud of you.

337
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,797
I didn't say that shit!

338
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,903
I know being here
      isn't easy for you...

339
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,408
...But I am gonna love that
        right out of you.

340
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,177
I promise.

341
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,120
You know, where you come from,

342
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:41,556
they have a name
        for what you are.

343
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,758
What?

344
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,760
A snitch.

345
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,101
We all have to work hard
  to keep this family together.

346
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:57,138
And I'm sure this is
     a much better situation

347
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,140
than where you came from.

348
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:04,245
goddamn it.

349
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,955
May I help you?

350
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:16,090
Hi. I'm with
 family and children's services.

351
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,659
We got a call
   from one of your neighbors

352
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:20,228
and would like to do
  a wellness check on the kids.

353
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,464
Mm-hmm.

354
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:28,703
-May I come in?
              -Mm.

355
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:37,512
Look, if it was
     chris meyers next door,

356
00:21:37,614 --> 00:21:39,480
I mean, you can't really believe
     anything that he says.

357
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:42,083
-He's, like, one of those
    bernie bro women-haters.
           -Excuse me.

358
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:44,352
What is that smell?

359
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:45,853
Uh, kombucha.

360
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:47,522
Pickled brussels sprouts.

361
00:21:47,624 --> 00:21:48,856
Both.

362
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:53,661
So, I was going over your file,
          and I noticed

363
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:55,963
-that you moved here
        five months ago.
         -Gayle: Mm-hmm.

364
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,965
Social worker:
        But when I called
         bledsoe county,

365
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,668
they said that they could not
        locate a record.

366
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,704
Gayle:
         Well, normally,
     kasey's our caseworker.

367
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:04,405
Did something happen?

368
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:06,207
She's sick.

369
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:07,742
There is dog hair

370
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:10,044
everywhere in here.

371
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:14,649
hello, darling.

372
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,584
Are you feeling okay?

373
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,787
Oh.

374
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:22,023
What is this?

375
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,425
Blueberries, like medicine.

376
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:28,196
Okay. Do you have
     a washcloth I can use?

377
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,766
Uh, no.

378
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,816
So how do you like living here?

379
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,621
I'm really, really hungry.

380
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:55,223
I just want to go home.

381
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,193
Don't worry.
 I'm gonna get you out of here.

382
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,729
Um, you know, could I speak
       with you privately?

383
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:03,798
I just think that there's
   some things about our case

384
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,433
you don't... You don't know.

385
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:07,869
-Um, sure. That's fine.
         -We'll go here.

386
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,470
Amber, why don't you
          start dinner.

387
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:10,605
Larry's hungry.

388
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,396
everything's fine.

389
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:41,436
-We're good.
 -Amber: Well, that's fantastic.

390
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:43,371
I made fried chicken again.

391
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:49,644
Eat up, guys.

392
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:12,967
mom:
     If you don't start using

393
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:14,435
your common sense
        and acting right,

394
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,671
these white people--
       they gon' kill you.

395
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:19,173
Kill you!

396
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,302
What's your problem?

397
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,710
amber?

398
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:31,178
Oh. Hey, larry.

399
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,547
Oh, we're going
      to the grand canyon.

400
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:33,881
You should get dressed.

401
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:36,217
Grand canyon?

402
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,686
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

403
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,396
Where are we going? Really.

404
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,366
Larry, get dressed.

405
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,002
We got to get going
    before the sun goes down.

406
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:01,676
amber:
      Okay. Let's go, guys.

407
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:13,988
Larry?

408
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,890
Come on. Let's go.

409
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:54,088
amber:
         Okay, cornpop.

410
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:58,059
Go be free.

411
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,528
Go.

412
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,940
Hey, cornpop's a survivor, okay?

413
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:14,375
He's-he's gonna make it.

414
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:16,911
Someone's gonna
        take care of him.

415
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:19,413
What the hell are we doing?

416
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,750
Well, we're doing
     what needs to be done.

417
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:27,855
You know the world
       we live in, amber.

418
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:30,424
It's horrible for these kids.

419
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:33,427
Without us to protect them,
  what's gonna happen to them?

420
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,529
They're gonna go back
        into foster care.

421
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,032
Just release them in the wild
          like cornpop?

422
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,034
We'd be prolonging
         the inevitable.

423
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:49,076
uh, when we adopted fatima,

424
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:51,078
I knew we were doing
        the right thing.

425
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,181
The agency even said so.

426
00:28:54,283 --> 00:28:56,183
I mean, we got that big loan
         from the bank.

427
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:58,519
I thought that... I thought
    that meant we were solid.

428
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:01,922
everyone was so supportive.

429
00:29:02,024 --> 00:29:04,291
Every single person.

430
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:08,596
And I just kept thinking,
             "why...

431
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:11,198
Why isn't anyone stopping us?"

432
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:17,438
Why didn't anyone stop us,
    gayle?

433
00:29:41,931 --> 00:29:44,131
amber:
       I... I don't think
         I can do this.

434
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,973
don't look back.

435
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:23,898
larry!

436
00:33:11,107 --> 00:33:13,674
so you finally decided
       to come home, huh?

437
00:33:18,014 --> 00:33:19,913
wait, mom.

438
00:33:20,016 --> 00:33:21,315
Yeah, baby?

439
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,452
some spaghetti in there?

440
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:31,058
yeah, spaghetti in there.

441
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:39,800
tv newswoman:
      Shocking news tonight.

442
00:33:39,902 --> 00:33:42,536
Authorities found children
         at a rest stop,

443
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:45,472
apparently abandoned
   after their adoptive parents

444
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:48,509
committed suicide
  by driving off of a bridge...

445
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:54,982
tv newsman:
   Terrible story.
