Okay, so you want a boyfriend?

Why?

195
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,851
'Cause I told you, I ain't
into that weird-ass fake shit.

196
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:36,483
Uh, why are you so moody today?

197
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:38,257
Because you ain't ask my
permission to take that,

198
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,382

- Permission? Nigga, you famous.

Look, just delete the
damn photo, Sierra!

200
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:41,983
Why? What was I supposed
to say, "please"?

201
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:43,784

You sitting over there, whining,
acting like you better than me

205
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:53,374
'cause I'm trying to get paid.

00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,466
Wake the fuck up.

207
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:56,459
That shit ain't real.

208
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:58,350
Look, I ain't got to
stop being me, all right?

209
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,676
That's something boring-ass
people like yo ass got to do.

210
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,265
Well, where are you going?

211

00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:08,072
I can walk, ho.

214
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,830
I told you, like, 50 times, man.

215
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,999
There are no zero gravity
scenes in Star Wars.

216
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,937
- You sure?
- Nigga, you ain't even seen those movies.

217
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,648
Why the fuck do you care?

218
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:54,240

00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:14,494
Yeah. So what are you doing here?

229
00:14:15,118 --> 00:14:16,385
- I'm just living, man.

230
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,074
You ain't got no car?

00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:42,201

Then they went there.

259
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:17,325

260
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,572

00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:56,670
Don't follow me, man.

272
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,480
Man, will you shut the hell up, man?

273
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:20,416
Stop following me! Take your ass home.

That's you.

278
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:33,063
Deer guts.

279
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,547
That's what I'll call you.

280
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:38,688
Big ol' black-boy deer guts.

281
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,456
You're stubborn.

282
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:46,609
You're stubborn, and you're black.

283
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:49,278
I'm serious, man.
Leave me the fuck alone!

284
00:20:51,738 --> 00:20:55,084
Boy, you is just like your mama.

285
00:20:56,971 --> 00:20:57,971

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,642
What's the matter?
You looking all crazy.

Why you sitting?

289
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:22,936
I'm tired, man.

290
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:26,148
I'm tired. I had a very bad day.

291
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:43,580
Shit.

292
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:44,737
Ahh.

293
00:21:44,892 --> 00:21:46,769
I-I just need to think, man.

294
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:50,856
Boy, ain't nobody could do that.

295
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:55,950
Nigga, you so damn useless.

296
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,518
You better watch how you
talk to people, deer guts.

297
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:06,989
You sit around in people's
houses insulting 'em.

298
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,593
You better stand up and make a decision

299
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:12,733

300
00:22:12,758 --> 00:22:16,032
Nigga, just leave me alone. Goddamn.

00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,757
Make the decision.

302
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:22,838
Nigga...

303
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,308
Keep standing still,

304
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:27,819
you're gone, boy.

305
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,646
You're wasting time.

306
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:34,550
And the only people
who got time are dead.

307
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,527
And if you're dead, I'm
gonna take them shoes

308
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:40,090

309
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:42,215

318
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:13,055
'cause ain't nobody out

319
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:19,177
One... two... three...

00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:40,361
Shit!

323
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,429
Hey, excuse me.

00:25:07,447 --> 00:25:09,420
Yeah, I'm Paper Boi.

327
00:25:15,188 --> 00:25:17,255
You want a picture?

328
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,285
Come on.

329
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:25,528
All right. There you go.

You got it? Take another one.
