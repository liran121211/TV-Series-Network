Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

-Yeah, damn.
-(door opens)

337
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,651
(door closes)

338
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,220
Is there a limit on these?

339
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,955
Nah, no limit.

340
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,523
Matter of fact,

341
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,492
I got to go get some stuff
from the mall, anyway.

342
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,527
So, want to roll?

343
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,229
Yeah, I'll roll.

344
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,730
Cool. Come on, then.

345
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,066
I got to get a pedicure,
anyway, man.

346
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,401
I got them vampire feet.

347
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,436
You know what I'm sayin'?

348
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,741
SHAG: So, I pretty much stay
with some of that, like, always.

349
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,878
The more exotic stuff like that
Skywalker depends, though.

350
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,379
ALFRED:
Yeah, I feel you, man.

351
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,881
Man, the ticket is right
on this, though.

352
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,917
And I can cut you
a better deal depending on

353
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,219
-how much you get, you know?
-Yeah, that makes sense, man.

354
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,022
The MDMA shouldn't be a problem
as long as you let me know

355
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,556
how much you want do
from, like, week to week.

356
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,025
All right, yeah.

357
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,559
Oh, oh, the way that smells.

358
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,494
-Yeah, man. That's cool, man.
-Yeah.

359
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,530
-Price is right?
-Oh, that's much better. Mm-hmm.

360
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,865
Yo, I'm a fan of your music,
by the way.

361
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,034
Shit's dope.

362
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,169
Thanks, man.

363
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:33,073
-* Don't wake... *
-(whispers): Sweet.

364
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,342
-DARIUS: * Don't wake me... *
-Yeah.

365
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,944
(sniffs)
Okay, I'm dreamin'.

366
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,578
-(laughs)
-(camera phone clicks)

367
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,214
Hey, yo... Yo, man?
You just take a picture of me?

368
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,817
No.

369
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,059
-Let me get this.
-Yeah, yeah.

370
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,128
You sure your boy cool, man?

371
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:56,463
Y-Yeah, it's just...

372
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,897
He's a fan.

373
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,632
I told you
he got the juice, man...

374
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,900
Oh.

375
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,369
-(laugh)
-Make your eyes water, bruh.

376
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,604
-Oh. Wow.
-This is good, man.

377
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,806
I mean, people want
that loud right here, bruh.

378
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,875
This smell like
my grandma's face.

379
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,710
(laughs)
That's right.

380
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,878
-(phone vibrates)
-This is it, right here, man.

381
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,380
Yeah. I think that's the one.

382
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,082
I know it's the one, man.
I can feel it.

383
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,883
(grunts)
Oh...

384
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
-Mwah.
-Bruh...

385
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,464
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's a funny show,

386
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,967
but the way they dive
into depression,

387
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,303
and especially after what
he did to her daughter.

388
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,737
I was like... like,

389
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,640
"Can I even feel bad
for this horse anymore?"

390
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,975
(scoffs)

391
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,610
Yo, man, I got to pick up
some shoes

392
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,278
for my job interview today.

393
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,683
Man, hey, yo, you seem
like the preppy type.

394
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,120
Yo, what's a good brand?

395
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,688
Uh, I don't know.

396
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,991
W-Why do I seem preppy?

397
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,893
I don't know, man,
you just look like the type.

398
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,465
Fuck it.

399
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,537
Yeah, these is what
I'm looking for.

400
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,439
Man, these white people
are gonna love me.

401
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,642
I'm-a get hired on the spot.

402
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,477
Mm.

403
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,678
This is it.

404
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,047
EARN:
So, um...

405
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,549
what kind of job
are you interviewing for?

406
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,818
Some marketing job or some shit.

407
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,654
Yo, they pay, like, 12 an hour.

408
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,090
I'm trying to hit
that lick, boy.

409
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,295
Yo, you went
to Princeton, right?

410
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,797
Yeah.

411
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,232
Man, how should I talk
to these white folk?

412
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,336
Um, I don't know.

413
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,804
Probably don't call them
"white folks,"

414
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,341
and... talk confidently.

415
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,579
A'ight.

416
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,047
A'ight, cool, cool.

417
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,582
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
I'm a talker.

418
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,749
(chuckles)

419
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,219
So, um...

420
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,488
Those gift cards,
they work in here?

421
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,590
I don't know.

422
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,358
I'm just gonna take this shit.

423
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,494
(laughs)

424
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,096
Wait, what?

425
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,530
Hell yeah.

426
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,831
They got a no chase policy.

427
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,899
(chuckles)

428
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,401
What are you talking about?

429
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,035
BRIAN:
Uh, hello, sir. Uh...

430
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,204
can I help you
find anything today?

431
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,938
They got a no chase policy.

432
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,607
They can't stop me.

433
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,343
Most of these stores got it.
It's a liability thing.

434
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,912
Even if they see me stealing,
they can't chase me.

435
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,681
Um, sir. Those shoes, can I get
you a different size, or...

436
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,684
See. He got to keep giving me
great customer service.

437
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,553
That's all he could do.

438
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:34,754
Hey, e-excuse me, sir.

439
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,988
Exc...

440
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,559
(chimes)

441
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,946
-(water running)
-*

442
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,962
(growling)

443
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,467
(laughs softly)

444
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,835
You high over there, man?

445
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:27,407
Yeah, man, definitely.
(laughs)

446
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,810
I mean, look, that kush

447
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,912
was legit, though,
man, for real.

448
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,415
Dude, I only smoke
the best shit.

449
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,519
I get it from Humboldt County,
best weed in America.

450
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,988
-(sighs) That's what's up, man.
-Yeah, man.

451
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,924
My uncle--
he's got a farm up there.

452
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,859
Been growing since forever.

453
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,095
Yeah, but how-how much
you do for the pound?

454
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,198
Man, it depends on the strain--

455
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,766
outdoor, indoor-- but for you,

456
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,969
I'll give you a good discount,
'cause I'm a fan.

457
00:18:57,003 --> 00:19:00,807
Well, I mean, like, what you
charge everybody else, though?

458
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,875
Nah, it's cool, bro.

459
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,912
I just got to get a pic
before you go.

460
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,949
(Andy laughs)

461
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,018
I'm just playing.
I'm just playing. You're good.

462
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,954
(Alfred and Darius laugh)

463
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,124
Yo, I saw you perform
at Dirty Laundry one time.

464
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,892
Me and my girl were in there.

465
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,329
Yeah, she's the one
that put me on to you, bro.

466
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,163
Word? Well, that's cool.

467
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,499
Wait. So your girl
like hippity hop?

468
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,868
Oh, yeah, man.
She's gangsta, bro.

469
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,170
-(laughter)
-Gangsta, man.

470
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:35,308
Yo, I can supply you
with pretty much anything.

471
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,910
Give me your phone number,
and we can link, all right?

472
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:40,313
I don't really do business over
the phone or anything,

473
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,650
but, you know, we can set up
some meetings or whatever.

474
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,919
*

475
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:50,557
(inhaling, bubbling)

476
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,594
(Alfred groans)

477
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,030
Hey, man, that tree was fire.

478
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,599
(both chuckle)

479
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,535
-Shit, I'm still high.
-Oh. (chuckles)

480
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,036
Yeah. Yeah, you are, nigga.

481
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,538
Go to the passenger's side.
(laughs)

482
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,574
Oh, that was...
that's where I was going.

483
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,042
-Oh. What's up?
-(train whistle blowing)

484
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:13,546
Hey, um...
how you know dude, again?

485
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,617
Oh, that's who our boy Jeff
used to re-up with.

486
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,786
Okay.

487
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,821
(grunts)

488
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,325
(phone buzzing)

489
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,440
* Paper Boi, Paper Boi,
I'm about that paper, boy *

490
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,875
* If you ain't on your grind
and you flexin' *

491
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,977
What the hell?

492
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:48,147
Yeah, an acoustic rap cover.

493
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,116
Them white girls love that shit.

494
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,984
Yeah, let me see.

495
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:54,253
ALFRED:
That nigga Andy sent it.

496
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,222
-Nope. Nope.
-(turns clip off)

497
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,858
(phone buzzes)

498
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,330
No, he didn't.

499
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,798
-No, this nigga didn't.
Man, c... -(phone whooshes)

500
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:10,069

-(Alfred sighing)
-(phone whooshing)

502
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,774
Oh.

503
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,843
(car engine starts,
tires squeal)

504
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:20,179
(phone whooshing rapidly)

505
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,649
(indistinct crowd chatter)

506
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,653
How you doing?

507
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,758
(register beeps)

508
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,327
You guys, um... take gift cards?

509
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,665

518
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:42,962

00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,270
Oh, I'm-a kill this nigga.

526
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,796
Man, I had to ride the bus
like this.

527
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,098
Think a old lady
stole my Vitamix, man.

528
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,534
-(laughs) -Damn, man,
that shit is expensive.

529
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,369
I hope you got the, uh,
insurance on it.

530
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,472
Man, Tracy owe me some money.

531
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,607
I didn't even get to spend
the whole $4,000.

532
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,108
And this nigga's stealing,

533
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,743
-right while I'm there,

534
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,745
Good luck getting any of that
damn money back.

-DARIUS: Wait, wait, wait.

536
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,915
-Tracy stole from the store?
-EARN: Yeah.

537
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,084
Right in front of me,
he took a bunch of shoes.

538
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,752
Said something about
a "no-chase policy."

539
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,253
Oh, yeah, he's right about that.

540
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:42,655
TV ADVERTISER: ...will not
protect or prevent injury...

541
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,123
Well, I hope he's happy.

542
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,493
-Almost got arrested.
-(laughs)

543
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,729
Smoke something, man.

544
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,763
Where were you?

545
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:52,765
I called you, like, six times.

546
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,735
Yeah, um...

547
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,436
I need a new phone.

548

00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,777

553
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,178
* Haters gonna hate like uh

554
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,814

00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,783

558
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,020
* And we drink Yoo-hoo
like it's dirty Sprite *

559
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,422

560
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,625

yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo. *

564
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,435
Yeah.

565
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,303
I mean, that might be
a big gap in my résumé,

566
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,640
but, you know,
I think I could be

567
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,074
a big help to this
organization here.

568
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,720
(exhales)

569
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,491
How you doing?

570
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:53,760
All right.

571
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:57,830
I think that might be
my biggest weakness,

572
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,298
because I love learning.

573
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,533
-MAN: Mm.
-TRACY: You know?

574
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,201
You cannot stop me
from learning.

575
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,170
Like, every day I'm looking for
something new to learn.

576
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:07,006
Well, I think you have
a lot of potential.

577
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,007
TRACY:
Huh.

578
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,676
Yeah. Yeah.

579
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:15,848
Unfortunately...

580
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:18,985
I don't think we'll be able to
offer you a job here right now.

581
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,288
It... We're just fully staffed
at the moment.

582

Fuck you want from me, man?

585
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,935
Get some black people

00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,503
