1
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,990
Sh... Sorry.

2
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,080
Do you got any dehydrated mango, ginger?

3
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,950
Jicama, perhaps?

4
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,290
Nah.

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,090
Hmm.

6
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,160
This place sucks.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,100
How much for that hat?

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,370
And this?

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,550
Ten dollars.

10
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,110
Bet.

11
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,130
Oh. Look at you.

Hello?

18
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,260
Hey, yeah, um, I'm here for the pickup.

19
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,230
Thank you.

20
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,730
Wow. I should probably... yeah.

21
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,250
Okay.

22
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,060
Hello?

23
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,070
Hello?

24
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,160
Um, I'm here for the... the, uh, pick...

25
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,150
Was that Mr. Wonder?

26
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,350
In the car?

27
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,460
Oh, yeah.

28
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,240
Music of My Mind.

29
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,070
Masterpiece.

30
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,110
I love Stevie.

31
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,540
Yeah, me, too.

32
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,830
I-I like to, uh, listen
to it on long drives

33
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,990
because, uh, his songs
are long, you know?

34
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,130
Yes.

35
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,630
I'm Darius.

36
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,200
Apologies.

37
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,840
I'm Theodore Perkins.

38
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,680
Please... call me Teddy.

39
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,320
Come on. Please, come sit in the parlor.

40
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,650
Oh, cool. I've never been in
a house with a parlor before.

41
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,540
Would you like a glass of water?

42
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,360
Yeah.

43
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,040
Kind of parched.

44
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,130
Darius would like a glass of
water when you have a moment.

45
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,730
Would you like some?

46
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,760
What is that?

47
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,660
It's a soft-boiled ostrich egg.

48
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,350
It's called an owl's casket.

49
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,140
Nah, I'm good.

50
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,360
So...

51
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,720
you're here about the piano.

52
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,720
How did you hear about it?

53
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,690
Um...

54
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,890
someone posted on the
biohacking message board

55
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,360
saying their boss had a
multicolored key piano.

56
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,080
Trying to get rid of it. Free of charge.

57
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,190
Sam. Was it Sam?

58
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,740
My audiovisual woman.

59
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,190
Uh, we don't use real names on
the message boards so, so maybe?

60
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,110
Hmm. Oops.

61
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,370
Are you a music lover?

62
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,620
Yeah. Yeah, I consider myself... yeah.

63
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,090
I work with a friend
of mine. He's a rapper.

64
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,870
Rap.

65
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,030
There's a funny one.

66
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,990
I found it never quite
grew out of its adolescence.

67
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,490
No, I wouldn't say that.

68
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,140
You know, we got Jay-Z. He's, like, 65.

69
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,460
But don't you find it
insufficient as an art form?

70
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,250
Nah, I think, you know,
every now and again,

71
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,720
people just want to have a good time.

72
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,850
Good time.

73
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,330
Hmm.

74
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,950
How long have you played?

75
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,660
Oh, you...

76
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,750
you're talking about the piano.

77
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,060
Uh, nah, I never studied.

78
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,740
I just, uh, kind of
like the way it looks,

79
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,070
especially this one
with the colored keys.

80
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,530
Are you a fan of Benny's?

81
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,290
Who?

82
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,990
Benny Hope.

83
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,290
The pianist.

84
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,090
He's the one who owned the piano.

85
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,590
He's my brother.

86
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,360
Oh, sh-shit! Is that Keith Jarrett?

87
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,280
Yes.

88
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,070
- Let me look at that.
- Yes.

89
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,510
And Stevie, as well.

90
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,150
And Al Jarreau and Ahmad Jamal.

91
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,140
I think Nina's over there somewhere.

92
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,200
Ahmad and my brother,

93
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,050
they had a residency
in New York together.

94
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,930
Hmm. That's Flames, man.

95
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,120
Yes. Flames.

96
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,070
My-my brother and Ahmad,
they were staying at a-a hotel

97
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,920
in Brooklyn off of Bergen Street.

98
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,780
Eight dollars a night,
if you can believe it.

99
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,240
He told me something I'll never forget.

100
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,210
He said, "Your brother...

101
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,610
plays pain better than anyone."

102
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,200
Benny just played what he knew.

103
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,890
Is he, uh, no longer with us?

104
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,740
No, he's alive.

105
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,860
He lives here with me.

106
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,680
I take care of him.

107
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,540
He developed a rare skin condition.

108
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,700
Can no longer go in the sunlight.

109
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,140
Yeah. You see, I keep
it quite dark in here.

110
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,700
- Damn.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,120
He must get depressed.

112
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,980
It's not easy.

113
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,710
But who knows?

114
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,590
Maybe one day we'll get
a great album out of it.

115
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,610
A masterpiece.

116
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,360
Yeah. Righteous, brother.

117
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,370
Uh, your, uh, your butler or whatever,

118
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,970
they, um, didn't bring the water yet.

119
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,970
Oh, I don't have a butler.

120
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,080
I just use this to remember things.

121
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,750
Finish that hat for Dionne Warwick.

122
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,160
Wash your hands, immediately.

123
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Darius would like a glass of water

124
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,750
when you have a moment.

125
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,660
Right then.

126
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,960
Excuse me.

127
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,700
This...

128
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,320
Yeah, I can't sit next to this. Mm-mm.

129
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,290
Mm.

130
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,110
Uh-huh.

131
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,770
Oh.

132
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,450
- Oh!
- Ooh!

133
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,090
What are you doing up here?

134
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,740
Uh, I-I just heard the piano.

135
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,070
It sounded great, so...

136
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,360
Shh, shh. Benny, he... he's sleeping.

137
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,530
He's very tired, um...

138
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,110
he needs his rest.

139
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,320
- You know?
- Okay.

140
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,690
- Uh-huh. Okay.
- Thank you.

141
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,140
Um, cool.

142
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,880
Do you... do you still want the water?

143
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,050
Oh... yeah.

144
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,010
I can bring it to you.

145
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,270
Downstairs.

146
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Bottled or tap?

147
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,560
Uh... bottled, I guess.

148
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,120
Oh. Bottled.

149
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,610
I'll bring it... I have Fiji, and Evian.

150
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,960
I'll mix it with some Poland Springs.

151
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,060
Maybe a Voss?

152
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,360
Okay.

153
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,560
No, I'll see you downstairs.

154
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,360
But I just wanted to ask...

155
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,300
Okay.

156
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,580
Why the fuck you still there?

157
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,090
Look, man, I really,
really want this piano, man.

158
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,030
It's nice.

159
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,790
There's colored keys. And it's free.

160
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,030
But is you willing to
die for it, though, man?

161
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,640
I mean, he sound like a serial killer.

162
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,430
And let me get a five cheese
Krystal combo, no fries.

163
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,490
It's cheaper with fries.

164
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,370
No fries.

165
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,160
That's rich nigga shit, man.

166
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,740
You don't know nothing about that.

167
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,510
Look, man, if I leave, I'll regret it.

168
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,530
And I got a two regret life limit pact.

169
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,270
Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

170
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,470
A what?

171
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,210
A two regret life limit pact.

172
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,840
Somebody got to take
me out if I go over two.

173
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,180
What? How would anyone know
you went over two regrets?

174
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,240
I'd tell them.

175
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,910
- Look...
- Oh, shit.

176
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,160
Paper Boi!

177
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,430
I mean, the dude is
obviously a weirdo, man.

178
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,660
Look, now just play along with it,

179
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,460
get the piano, get the hell up out.

180
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,460
Yeah, but how, though, man?

181
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,300
I feel like...

182
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,360
like he stalling or something.

183
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,310
Like he want to keep me here.

184
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,220
Explain it again, man.

185
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,960
Is Teddy the white
dude or the black dude?

186
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,000
You know what? I don't even
think Teddy exists, bro.

187
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,070
I feel like Benny created
Teddy to make up for the fact

188
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,990
that he made himself look like a ghoul.

189
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,000
A ghoul?

190
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,380
I mean, how bad is it?

191
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,150
It's real bad, man.

192
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,730
I mean, bad.

193
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,830
The nigga look like somebody
left Sammy Sosa in the dryer.

194
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,460
Sammy Sosa?

195
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,820
Yeah. Skin bleaching?

196
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,690
Look, have somebody type in, um,

197
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,740
"Sammy Sosa hat" in Google image search.

198
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,980
Hey, man, look, man.

199
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,150
Sometimes, people come
over, they want a quarter,

200
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,770
and they feel like they
can sit and chat and shit.

201
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,330
But other people, you
know what I'm saying, like,

202
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,220
they want an eighth, they pay
me, and they get the hell on.

203
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,200
- Can I take a flick? To Laurence.
- Look, man...

204
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,810
- Say happy birthday, Laurence.
- That's how I know

205
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,700
- that I'm simply a conduit...
- This nigga gonna stunt on me

206
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,020
- with the new iPhone.
- between them and their weed.

207
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,230
See, keep gunning, and
he ain't got no choice

208
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,590
but to make clear what he want from you.

209
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,730
I see what you're saying.
I see, I see what you're...

210
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,820
you're saying be unequivocally honest

211
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,860
to make a healthy transaction.

212
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,740
Wow, man, you know what?

213
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,900
You keep this up, you could
be the next Steve Harvey, bro.

214
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,840
Steve Harvey, nigga? No, no, no.

215
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,370
I'm-I'm like Dr. Phil,
you know what I'm saying?

216
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,320
- Yo.
- Hell, that, that nigga stay caked up.

217
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,980
- Yo! Shit!
- What the...?

218
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,910
Oh, shit! Oh!

219
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,680
- What happened?
- Yo!

220
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,680
Yo, why this nigga the same
color as his fucking hat?

221
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,850
Yeah, man, this nigga looks
like a white man's penis.

222
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,740
Yo, man,

223
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,560
why this nigga look like
what's under a scab, though?

224
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,230
- Goddamn.
- Oh, God.

225
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,380
Peace, man.

226
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,370
All right, peace.

227
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,390
Oh, God.

228
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,510
Put some extra fries in there.

229
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,500
Take them out.

230
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,000
Just don't eat them, damn.

231
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
Man.

232
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,590
Hmm.

233
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,660
Ugh.

234
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,970
Surprise.

235
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,740
Shit. Yeah, I'm not a big photo person.

236
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,700
Apologies.

237
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,260
Um, this is yours, anyway.

238
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,820
I got you your water.

239
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,560
Oh, yes, thank you.

240
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,240
I needed that.

241
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,820
Hmm.

242
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,780
Oh. That's cool.

243
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,680
Feel free to take any of it.

244
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,310
Yeah.

245
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,680
What is this place, man?

246
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,080
It's a gift shop.

247
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,680
I designed it myself to
feel... like a trophy room.

248
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,190
More in the motif of the museum.

249
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,580
Oh, wait, so you're turning
this whole place into a museum?

250
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,350
Yes. I've already started the process

251
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,480
of making this a historical site.

252
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,710
You're actually the first
person to be in here.

253
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,590
Feel free to Twitter
or blogspot any of it.

254
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,450
Uh, you know what, actually,
I'm kind of in a rush, uh...

255
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,610
May I show you something? Um...

256
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,510
I-I promise to get you your piano.

257
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,550
I... I really think you'll
like what I have in store.

258
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,750
Sure.

259
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,820
What's in there?

260
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,100
Go ahead.

261
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,490
Walk in.

262
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,530
Okay.

263
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,740
Hey, uh, Teddy?

264
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,330
Uh...

265
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,250
This is my favorite part of the museum.

266
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,180
What the hell is this?

267
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,950
This is my father.

268
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,490
He's the reason for all of this.

269
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,620
When me and Benny were children,

270
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,450
he instituted a very
rigorous training method.

271
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,490
Piano three hours a day,

272
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,690
twice a day.

273
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,700
With exams on Sundays,

274
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,300
that, if failed,

275
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,300
meant physical punishment.

276
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,070
He wanted the best out of us.

277
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,140
It's because of him we have all of this.

278
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,240
So you said your dad,
uh, used to beat you

279
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,500
so you'd be good at piano?

280
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,890
To be good at life.

281
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,480
We were his sacrifice.

282
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,110
Oh. Well, um, I'm not trying

283
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,970
to, like, shit on your
dad, or nothing, man,

284
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,360
but that seems a little... unnecessary.

285
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,170
Most people wouldn't understand.

286
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,420
To make an omelet, you
have to break a few eggs.

287
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,700
I mean, to build bridges,
people have to fall.

288
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,150
Are you not mad at your dad?

289
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,280
Of course not.

290
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,910
There was no way for a child
to understand what was at stake.

291
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,450
He just wanted the best for us.

292
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,270
My father used to say,

293
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,050
"Great things come from great pain."

294
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,240
I want this wing of the museum

295
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,770
to be dedicated to great fathers.

296
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,430
My father, Joe Jackson,

297
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,050
Marvin Gay Sr....

298
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,860
Tiger Woods's father,

299
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,880
Serena Williams's father,

300
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,360
- _
- the father that drops off

301
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,400
Emilio Estevez in The Breakfast Club.

302
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,160
Hey, uh, look, I...

303
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,530
I'd like to make this transaction

304
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,660
as efficient as possible.

305
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,800
So is there any documents I got to sign?

306
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,390
For tax purposes?

307
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,320
Of course.

308
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,530
Uh...

309
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,880
Ted?

310
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,670
Sure, um, sorry I can't,
uh, thank Benny himself,

311
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,000
personally, man.

312
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,730
Don't be.

313
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,580
The disease is very advanced,

314
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,130
and he doesn't like
people seeing him that way.

315
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,200
It's a very hard thing.

316
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,050
Yeah.

317
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,410
- I can imagine...
- No, you can't!

318
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,050
You have no idea.

319
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,160
Sign the highlighted parts.

320
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,920
I have to go turn on the elevator.

321
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,910
When it arrives,

322
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,230
place the piano on it.

323
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,750
I'll wait for you in the lobby.

324
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,440
Okay, well, thanks...

325
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,700
All right, what is this?

326
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,740
The hell?

327
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,730
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Back.

328
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,690
All right.

329
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,870
Fine, destiny.

330
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,230
Shh.

331
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,700
_

332
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,660
Okay. What do you want me to do?

333
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,610
_

334
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,560
Come on. Are you serious?

335
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,970
Uh...

336
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,100
But why can't, why can't
you just get the gun?

337
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,490
All right. All right.
I'll go get your gun,

338
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,510
but I got to put my piano
in the car first, okay?

339
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,220
So you stay here.

340
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,910
And I'll be back with your... gun.

341
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,780
Why would he say that, though?

342
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,010
I don't even know, bro.
This dude crazy, bruh.

343
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,800
He want me to kill him,
this dude way past depressed.

344
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,490
This whole situation's just been weird

345
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,310
since I got here.

346
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,180
Yep. Fuck this shit, bro.

347
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,610
Look, I got the piano.

348
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,920
Now I'm just gonna get
the hell up out of...

349
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,900
Let me call you back, bro.

350
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,090
Hey. Hey, Teddy!

351
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,600
Your car is blocking mine.

352
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,210
Teddy?

353
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,900
Come on, Benny, put something into it.

354
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,860
Posture.

355
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,750
Posture. Keep your form.

356
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,830
Don't you cry.

357
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,450
Again!

358
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,270
- I love this song.
- Oh, shit.

359
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,240
Yeah.

360
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,000
Something wrong?

361
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,400
Uh...

362
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,620
Watch your form.

363
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,160
Yeah. You-you, uh, parked your
car right in front of mine.

364
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,910
Oh.

365
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,360
I'll move it.

366
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,610
Um...

367
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,390
Anything else?

368
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:02,030
Uh, where's your, uh, bath-bathroom?

369
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,740
It's up the stairs.

370
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,520
Third door on your left.

371
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,070
Okay.

372
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,150
Right next to the attic.

373
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,180
I was just up there myself.

374
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,410
Do you know what I found?

375
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

376
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,620
Hey, man. Chill, chill.

377
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,450
Congratulations.

378
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,890
For-for what?

379
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,120
I choose you.

380
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,260
You're my sacrifice.

381
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,150
Put your phone on the ground.

382
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,610
No.

383
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,050
Keep that.

384
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,350
I want it to look real.

385
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,270
Want what to look real?

386
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,960
The home invasion.

387
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,820
You killed Benny because
you were obsessed.

388
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,110
No, man. You...

389
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,310
Look, there is no
fucking Benny, all right?

390
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,790
Exactly.

391
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,330
Exactly.

392
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,740
Sit in the chair.

393
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,070
Put them on.

394
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,750
Ankles first.

395
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,200
You know, uh, not all great things

396
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,500
come from great pain.

397
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,470
Sometimes it's love.

398
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,610
Not everything's a sacrifice.

399
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,150
Sacrifices are necessary, Darius.

400
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,410
Yeah, maybe.

401
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,600
But your dad should have said sorry.

402
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,220
I'm sorry.

403
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,050
Shit.

404
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,750
I went through daddy shit myself.

405
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,790
But when you're young,
you try to just...

406
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,440
make it be okay and say
everything's gonna be fine.

407
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,290
And that's just,

408
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,320
you don't know the difference, but...

409
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,600
that don't give you an excuse to grow up

410
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,570
and repeat the same shit over and over.

411
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,870
It's like there's a,
there's a "what if" factor.

412
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,100
What if you would have been
great at something else?

413
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,700
Or if you would have seen the love...

414
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,440
instead of all the other
shit like, like Stevie.

415
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,580
I'm sorry?

416
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,070
Stevie Wonder.

417
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,340
Stevie had his own... sacrifices.

418
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,990
He was blind.

419
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,150
Yeah, but he wasn't blinded.

420
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,590
He saw through his music.

421
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,210
That's beautiful...

422
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,430
but wrong.

423
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,190
Benny.

424
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,360
You're alive.

425
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,510
Shit.

426
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,980
Fuck.

427
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,360
Benny, uh, look. I'm sorry that you

428
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,630
had to go through what
you had to go through, man.

429
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,830
It...

430
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,820
What?

431
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,090
Oh.

432
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,450
Wait, Benny, what are
you, what are you do...?

433
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,150
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

434
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,130
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, shit!

435
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,220
Oh! Fuck.

436
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,540
Oh, shit. Goddamn it.

437
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,930
Ugh.

438
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,320
Fuck.

439
