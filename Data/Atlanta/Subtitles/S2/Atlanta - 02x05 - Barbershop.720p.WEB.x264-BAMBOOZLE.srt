1
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,301
No, I got, I got into it
with the Mexicans, man.

2
00:00:29,537 --> 00:00:31,604
I got to deal with some eses.

3
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:34,885
Huh? It ain't my fault
I don't speak Spanish.

4
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:37,292
Yeah, I thought quince meant 18.

5
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:41,293
Well, what does she have
on a wedding dress for?

6
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,658
Hey, sorry for being late, my man.

7
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:45,172
Commode in my house backed up

8
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:48,117
and my petty-ass girlfriend
done hid all the plungers.

9
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:49,918
It's all good, man. It's-it's all good.

10
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,457
- What was that?
- What?

11
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:52,792
I'm sorry, did you say something?

12
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:54,293
Yeah, I was answering you, man.

13
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:55,822
Oh, no, I'm on the phone, my man.

14
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,480
Okay, hold on, son.

15
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:00,451
Yeah, she said she ain't even
trust me around rubber and wood.

16
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:01,675
Hid all the plungers.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,979
What type of petty person
do some shit like that?

18
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:05,071
Yeah, absolutely.

19
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,151
Yeah. So what we doing?

20
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,063
My man, what we doing?

21
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:12,178
Oh, nigga, I don't know when
you talking to me, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:14,480
Um, the usual.

23
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:17,149
No. Course not.

24
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:19,251
She don't be thinking
about nothing else, either.

25
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,414
With that fine ass, she
gonna get it, though.

26
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:22,793
You know what I'm saying? It's all good.

27
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:24,834
When I get my income tax,
I'm-a open my own shop

28
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:28,194
or-or I'm-a buy my own
WNBA team, one of those...

29
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,628
- Yo, Bibby.
- Huh?

30
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:31,363
- Can we...?
- Hey, man, let me let you go.

31
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,365
I got somebody sitting in the chair.

32
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:35,935
Yeah, he's a little hostile.
I got to jet. I'll let you go.

33
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,704
Yeah, it's gonna probably take
me a little minute with this.

34
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:41,373
Yeah. All right, okay, I'm fine with it.

35
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,131
Junebug did what? You is bullshittin'.

36
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:46,292
- Bibby, man. If you don't... man...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,047
Hey. Hey, let me, let me let you go.

38
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:50,983
All right, Bubba, okay, cool.
All right. All right, man.

39
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:53,755
Sorry about that, man. So
what'd you say we're doing today?

40
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:55,433
The usual, Bibby.

41
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,377
- All right, then, the usual it is.
- Yeah.

42
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,871
Hey. Let me ask you a question.
Did you see the news last night?

43
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:03,457
Them savages from Atlanta that
went into that T-Mobile store,

44
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:04,797
drove they car in there,

45
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:07,629
- got away with about 100 phones.
- Yeah, man. It's crazy out here.

46
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:09,468
I mean, it's-it's that time
of year though, I guess.

47
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,970
Yeah. Crazy.

48
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,671
Hey, yo, and that reminds me, listen.

49
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:14,740
If you know somebody
that needs a iPhone,

50
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:16,308
tell them to holla at
me if they with T-Mobile.

51
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,626
- I got the hookup on the low.
- Got you, man.

52
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:20,259
- I appreciate that.
- All right.

53
00:02:20,284 --> 00:02:21,413
So what we doing now?

54
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,845
Like I said, man, the usual.

55
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,834
All right, the usual, damn.

56
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:27,243
Usual, gonna have the usual.

57
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:28,354
You don't want to do nothing different?

58
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:30,756
No, man. Look, I got, I got
a photo shoot coming up, man.

59
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,358
- So I just... want to look good.
- Oh!

60
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:33,959
Oh, you got a photo shoot coming up.

61
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:36,262
- Yeah, man. I mean...
- Oh, you Hollywood now, huh?

62
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:37,696
Nah, man. It's just a
write-up for me in a magazine.

63
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:38,998
Yeah. My boy done went all Hollywood.

64
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,099
It's a write-up in a magazine,

65
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:41,433
and they want to take some pictures,

66
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,935
so that's-that's what I'm doing.

67
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,104
Hey, you dating Kim Kardashian
now? That's what that is?

68
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:45,918
No, Bibby, man.

69
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,668
My boy done went
straight Hollywood on me.

70
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:49,382
- That's good, though.
- It ain't no Hollywood, Bibby.

71
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:50,710
- I ain't going no Hollywood, man.
- Huh?

72
00:02:50,724 --> 00:02:52,723
You know what, that reminds
me, as a matter of fact,

73
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:54,113
I'm glad you brought
that Hollywood shit up.

74
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:57,049
Me and my girl snuck in the
AMC the other day, see a movie.

75
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:59,051
We was looking at the
movie posters on the wall,

76
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:01,453
and guess how many movie
posters they got on there

77
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,455
with black people on them.

78
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:06,446
- Guess!
- One.

79
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:07,770
- Zero!
- Zero.

80
00:03:07,795 --> 00:03:08,926
It's sad, man.

81
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:10,829
Key and Peele put a movie
out with a cat in it,

82
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:12,298
they put the cat on the poster.

83
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,966
They dressed the cat up
like a nigga instead of

84
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:15,801
putting two niggas that
made the movie on the poster.

85
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:17,803
So was it a cat in a suit
or just looked like a nigga?

86
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:19,238
It was... You know, you know a cat,

87
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:20,439
what a, what a nigga cat look like!

88
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:21,986
Okay. All right, man. I got it.

89
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,342
- It's fucked up. I know.
- It is.

90
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,511
Shit's nuts out here. I'm
glad somebody agree with me.

91
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:27,641
See, that's why I like you. You smart.

92
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,667
Smarter than a lot of
them. Why I like you.

93
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:36,413
Oh, you got somewhere to be?

94
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:38,169
- Yes! Bibby, man. Yeah, I said that, man.
- Oh, shit, my bad.

95
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,584
- Hey, I didn't know. My bad. Hey.
- Just...

96
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,251
Hey, no big deal, baby.

97
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,876
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

98
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:45,359
No big deal. You should've said that.

99
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:47,187
- All right, man. We good.
- I'll get you squared away.

100
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,793
Oh, shit. Don't worry about that.

101
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:50,469
Don't worry. That ain't nothing.

102
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:54,558
Yeah, I got the cut, the usual. Uh-huh.

103
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,716
Get you ready for Hollywood.

104
00:03:56,741 --> 00:04:00,153
That reminds me, hey, did
you see that basketball player

105
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,947
that hit all them people at
the club in that invisible car?

106
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:03,449
- That shit on YouTube.
- Yeah, man.

107
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:05,451
- I-I know about it.
- That is the funniest vi...

108
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:07,386
You got to see this shit.
I got to show you this.

109
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,708
- Yeah, man.
- Shit here is funny.

110
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,598
But I ain't got to, I
ain't got to, I already...

111
00:04:11,623 --> 00:04:12,755
Uh-uh. You got to watch this.

112
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,099
You need to watch this, trust me.

113
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:16,061
Yeah, watch that right quick.

114
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:17,763
I'm-a use the bathroom, though.

115
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,932
- Man, where you go...?
- Let me just...

116
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:26,182
Hey, Bibby, man. Somebody...

117
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:27,840
Somebody calling your phone, bruh.

118
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,376
Raindrops, peach emoji?

119
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:33,697
Hello? What you doing?

120
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:36,229
Uh-uh. Don't do that. Don't
go through that. Hello?

121
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:38,417
Baby, baby, baby, what

122
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:41,275
I'm on my way! I'm ten minutes...

123
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,181
I'm on 85 right now, I promise.

124
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:45,306
Promise to God, I'm on 85!

125
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:48,729
All right, I'm-a be there. Cool. Shit.

126
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,114
Oh, boy.

127
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,691
- What are, what are you doing?
- Leaving.

128
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:57,213
Leav...? Man, Bibby,

129
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:58,460

130
00:04:58,484 --> 00:04:59,394
Look at this shit, man. Come on now!

131
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,695
It's cool 'cause you coming with me.

132
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,130
- Come on.
- Bibby, I ain't going...

133
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:03,698
Man, I ain't going nowhere
till my hair get cut, bruh.

134
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,033
Come on, man. Listen, my girl stay

135
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:07,485
five minutes around the
corner. I'll cut you over there.

136
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,536
- We'll be right back.
- Why, man?

137
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:09,938
We already in a barbershop, bruh.

138
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:11,406
Hey. I know you don't
want nobody else in here

139
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,777
to cut your hair for
your billboard, do you?

140
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:15,268
You trying to go to Hollywood now.

141
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:17,273
You want to be on the poster or
you want the cat on the poster?

142
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:19,937
- A'ight, man.
- Come on now. Yeah, so...

143
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,520
- Come on.
- Shit, man!

144
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,675
- All right, let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

145
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,687
We got to go out the back, man.

146
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:27,822
Them people, them people be out
there. Just come on this way.

147
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:29,824
We ain't going out the front?

148
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:32,067
Oh, goddamn.

149
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,125
Hey, fam, what your cable
situation looking like?

150
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:48,927
- What?
- Yeah, your cable.

151
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,345
'Cause, listen, I'm
with Clear Cable now.

152
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,113
I'm working with them on the side.

153
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:54,616
So if you sign up with me, I'll
make sure you're taken care of.

154
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,750
- You know what I'm talking about?
- I'm straight, Bibby.

155
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:02,857
Well, fine. Do this for me, then.

156
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:05,401
Take these business cards,
pass them out at your show

157
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:06,768
or take them to a studio or something.

158
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:09,097
Throw them at the crowd,
whatever you got to do.

159
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:10,565
Make sure you pick
up my loosies, though,

160
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,867
'cause them ain't cheap.

161
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:15,903
"Klear Cable." With a "K."

162
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:18,535
Clever, right?

163
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:22,243
Toothpick?

164
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,297
50 cent.

165
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,626
I'm good, man.

166
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,584
Hey. Yo, my man. Hey.
Where your mom at, boy?

167
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,768
Where your...? Oh, baby, I'm here!

168
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:53,741
You a hour late. Come on, Omari.

169
00:06:53,777 --> 00:06:55,009
Hour late? What you talking about?

170
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,344
Let's go. We're going. Let's go.

171
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,127
- Come on.
- Wait, baby. Calm down. Calm down.

172
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,517
Bibby, I ain't got time for this.

173
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,501
- Move!
- Baby, I'm here now. What you doing?

174
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,476
- This ain't none of my fault.
- Whose fault is it?

175
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,553
It's his fault!

176
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:07,906
You always got some type of excuse, man!

177
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:09,570
No, this not no excuse this time.

178
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,692
Seriously, this is his fault.

179
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:12,492
He called me, talking about
his car was broke down.

180
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,593
You know what I'm talking about?
And I was on my way home to you.

181
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,292
I had told him. He
said, could I help him.

182
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,820
I was like, "Nah, I got
to go do the right thing."

183
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:18,644
You know what I'm saying?

184
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:20,011
But he start crying and stuff.

185
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:21,135
Talking about his engine.

186
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,670
Yeah, he had queef engine
or something like that.

187
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:24,522
And his carburetor had jaundice.

188
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:26,877
So I then had to go and pick
him up off the side of the road.

189
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,291
'Cause only reason why I did that

190
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,667
is 'cause of all that Jesus
stuff you've been teaching me.

191
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:30,460
- You know what I'm saying?
- Mm-hm.

192
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:31,319
You're supposed to help.

193
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:33,197
- What would Jesus do?
- Why he wearing a cape?

194
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:35,583
He a magician! How I supposed to know?

195
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:38,236
Listen, baby, look. Look, now.

196
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,486
I'm trying to do the right thing.

197
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:40,965
I only did this 'cause of you.

198
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,390
You've been trying to get my life right.

199
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:43,658
It's been 'cause of you I'm doing this.

200
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:45,493
I wouldn't even help the
nigga had it not been for you.

201
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:47,195
That's why I even came
over here to tell you.

202
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,696
I wanted to thank you
for all the stuff...

203
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:51,633
You-You done changed my
life. Thank you, baby.

204
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:56,216
- Hurry up.
- Thank you.

205
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,575
Come on, baby. Here.

206
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,251
My man, come on, let's get it. Let's go.

207
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,404
I ain't got all day.

208
00:08:15,315 --> 00:08:18,985
Oh... hey. I wasn't talking to you.

209
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,228
I was talking to my man. Come on, bro.

210
00:08:20,263 --> 00:08:21,896
Bibby, man, I know you
kidding me with this shit.

211
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:23,331
I know you ain't just gonna cut his hair

212
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,066
after driving me around
damn creation, man!

213
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:27,061
Listen, I know, but he
had an appointment, though.

214
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:28,686
- Nigga, so did I!
- That's true.

215
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:30,592
But, technically, his was before yours.

216
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:32,740
Know what I'm sayin'?
Just calm down, man.

217
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:34,642
We gonna be here five minutes.
He... he just need a line.

218
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:36,529
- Go on, Bibby, man! Shit!
- Thank you, man.

219
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:38,527
Come on now. It's all good.

220
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,982
Five more minutes.

221
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:01,585
All right, little man. There you go.

222
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:03,835
- Bibby!
- What?

223
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,839
The water's not running.

224
00:09:04,874 --> 00:09:06,741
I thought you said you paid the bill.

225
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:08,132
I did pay the bill!

226
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,793
Well, I guess I'm imagining things, huh?

227
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,043
Thought I paid that bill.

228
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,120
You're a magician?

229
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:20,888
No.

230
00:09:20,924 --> 00:09:22,456
That's what Bibby said.

231
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:24,992
- Well, Bibby's an idiot.
- That's mean.

232
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:29,272
Can you show me a trick?

233
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:33,067
Little man. I just told you
I wasn't a magician, okay?

234
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,676
What's wrong with your hair?

235
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,384
Are you sick or something?

236
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:42,388
- The hell?
- That was your trick?

237
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:45,591
And now the power?!

238
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,979
- Bibby, you said you paid that!
- I did pay it, baby.

239
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,423
You know Donald Trump
and them biz out here.

240
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:53,183
The devil always
trying to steal our j...

241
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:55,862
You did not just steal from me.

242
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:57,793
This for the boy haircut!

243
00:09:57,854 --> 00:09:59,360
I got to go, baby. God bless you now.

244
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:01,529
Bibby.

245
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,341
Bibby!

246
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:07,415
This nigga! Shit!

247
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,826
Hey, man.

248
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,976
Sorry about all that.

249
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:20,301
You know how crazy these hos can get.

250
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,268
Hey, guess I'm staying with my
other woman tonight, you know...

251
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:25,193
Bibby, man, just take me
back to the shop, all right?

252
00:10:25,218 --> 00:10:26,816
I ain't playing with you, Bibby.

253
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:29,821
Okay, all right. All right.

254
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:31,173
You must be starving though, right?

255
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:32,326
Hell yeah, man.

256
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:34,351
My whole day been fucked up so far. Yes.

257
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:37,254
Good. Let me get you something
to eat. It's the least I can do.

258
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,822
I'm-a take care of you.

259
00:10:38,858 --> 00:10:40,213
Take you right back
to the shop after that.

260
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,539
We're gonna eat. Hey, you like Zaxby's?

261
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:46,159
Nigga, don't be rude.

262
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:48,732
- Of course I love Zaxby's.
- I got you.

263
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:50,888
Thank you.

264
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:53,013
Talking 'bout. Shit.

265
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,777
What...?

266
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,920
- Yeah.
- Nigga, what the fuck is this?

267
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,534
Come on, man, you know
I dabble in construction

268
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:05,266
from time to time.
Come on, you got to eat!

269
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:06,634
Nigga, this ain't no restaurant!

270
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,338
You coming or not? Come on!

271
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:11,538
Here we go.

272
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:13,576
Zaxby's!

273
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:17,705
Nigga, these your leftovers?

274
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:21,618
No! I mean, I did eat the
chicken wings. And the sauce.

275
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:23,817
And part of that bread. But
them chicken tenders right there,

276
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:25,319
that's all you, my man.

277
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:28,564
Take me back to the
shop, now, 'cause I swear,

278
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:29,901
you keep playing with me, Bibby,

279
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:31,908
and I'm-a fuck you up, all right?

280
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:34,243
Listen. You the one said you was hungry.

281
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:35,948
I was just trying to help you out,

282
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:37,306
but we can go back to the shop.

283
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,901
Thank you. Let's go, man.

284
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:40,495
Hey, yo, just help me get this lumber

285
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,192
- in the back of my truck...
- Man, fuck that, man!

286
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,262
Finish my hair!

287
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,905
Man, help me get this lumber. I promise,

288
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:47,450
the faster we do this, the
faster I can cut your hair.

289
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:49,802
I'm taking you right back to
the shop after this, I promise.

290
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:52,413
Just help me load this up. I promise!

291
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:55,282
Fuck, man!

292
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,118
Nigga, three? You better pick up five.

293
00:11:58,123 --> 00:12:00,033
- Use your back, too, bitch.
- I don't have that many muscles.

294
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:01,560
Come on, man.

295
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:06,860
Perfect. Just got one
more bundle, my man.

296
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,284
Shit!

297
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,547
Hey, yo, Al, let's go, man.

298
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:16,921
What do you think you're
doing? You stealing my lumber?

299
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,372
- What the... What are you, uh...
- Hey, ma'am, calm...

300
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:20,751
What the hell do you think
you're doing on my property?

301
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:22,076
- Ma'am, calm down.
- You're trespassing.

302
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,344
I know, ma'am. Just calm down. Listen.

303
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,145
No, I will not calm down.
Who the hell are you?

304
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:26,180
Listen, I work for the contractors

305
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:27,381
that's building the house, right?

306
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,055
I loaned ya'll this
lumber as collateral.

307
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:32,325
- And then ain't nobody paid us...
- I'm calling the cops.

308
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:33,492
- Bibby.
- Don't call the... Listen.

309
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,842
All that ain't necessary, ma'am.

310
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,561
I had to reconfiscate this wood

311
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:37,835
'cause ain't nobody paid me my money.

312
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,350
So, you should speak to your husband,

313
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,452
so we can get paid.

314
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:42,874
Oh, I will call my husband,
and then the police.

315
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,561
Well, do it then, beige lady! Call 'em!

316
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:47,818
Hey! You son of a bitch.

317
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:49,576
We're gonna sue you!

318
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,787
Sue! But you need to
talk to your husband,

319
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,508
'cause we ain't had no
contracts, 'cause he cheap.

320
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:01,815
That's my wood!

321
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,294
Hey. You don't think she
called the police, do you?

322
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:16,930
I'm still on probation,
nigga, so I hope the fuck not.

323
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:20,558
Nah, she ain't call 'em.
We all right. It's all good.

324
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,550
Do I even have to say it, Bibby?

325
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,035
- We should probably...
- Should probably head back to the shop.

326
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,784
- Just head on back to the shop, yeah.
- Right? That's right.

327
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:30,344
I'm-a take you right on back,
get you cut up real quick.

328
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:33,226
I got you, Paper Boi.

329
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:44,541
- Oh, hell no!
- What the...?

330
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:59,159
Bibby, goddamn it, man!
What are you doing?!

331
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,124
- It's all good. It's all good.
- Fucking toothpicks, man. Shit!

332
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:09,951
How you gonna do that when
I got no seat belt on, nigga?

333
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:11,434
My bad. You should wear
your seat belt at all times.

334
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,036
Yeah, no shit. Why is your shit...?

335
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:14,771
- Yeah, that's the only thing.
- Man, Bibby...

336
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:16,072
Fuck it.

337
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,574
Oh, yeah, that one don't work good.

338
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,992
Shit.

339
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:29,586
Lamar!

340
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:31,274
Look, Pops...

341
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:33,251
Hey, tell me they just kidnapped you.

342
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:34,916
I know good and goddamn
well you ain't out here

343
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,259
skipping school again.

344
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:37,527
Tell me you're not
skipping school again.

345
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:38,762
- I'm sorry, Pops!
- Nah, don't be sorry.

346
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:40,363
- Shit.
- Don't be sorry now.

347
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,098
You think I work hard
at these three jobs

348
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:45,335
so you can walk around town
with your little nigglet friends,

349
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,337
skipping school all day?

350
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:49,865
I work hard, man.

351
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,795
But y'all think y'all
grown, don't you? Huh?

352
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,678
Well, since y'all grown,
please tell me you put up

353
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:56,680
the street team posters
I gave you today.

354
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,081
Man, we put up a couple.

355
00:14:58,116 --> 00:14:59,616
- I beg your pardon?
- We put up a couple!

356
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:01,451
- Come again, say what?
- We put up a couple!

357
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:03,720
Give them to me. Give them to me.

358
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,605
Man, y'all barely made a dent!

359
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:10,798
You had one thing to do today.

360
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:12,852
We ain't gonna never get this $35 now.

361
00:15:12,877 --> 00:15:14,931
And I trusted you to do this for me.

362
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:17,493
You little niggas ain't shit, man.

363
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:18,601
That's all right, though.

364
00:15:18,637 --> 00:15:20,704
'Cause I got somebody here
for you, matter of fact.

365
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,211
Hey, yo, Alfred!

366
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,490
The hell you want, Bibby?

367
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:28,104
Hey! Come inspire the youth!

368
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:30,797
- Man, I ain't in this!
- Alfred, this is my son.

369
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,123
Yo, is that, is that Paper Boi?

370
00:15:34,148 --> 00:15:35,719
Yeah, that's right. That is Paper Boi.

371
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:37,153
And I brought him up
here to inspire y'all,

372
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:38,561
since y'all don't listen to me.

373
00:15:38,586 --> 00:15:40,897
Hey, yo! How come you don't look fresh?

374
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:43,059
- Excuse me?
- You don't look fresh or famous.

375
00:15:43,095 --> 00:15:46,420
Y-Your hair is raggedy as shit. Damn!

376
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,831
You out here looking
like a Super Saiyan.

377
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:49,582
Your hair is fucked up, man.

378
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:51,355
Like, damn. Oh, shit.

379
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,409
What the fuck did you
do to his hair, yo?

380
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,821
- Lamar. Not right now. Not right now.
- Pops. Pops.

381
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:57,006
Not right now.

382
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:02,384
You know why it's fucked up? Hey.

383
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,790
You know why it's fucked up?

384
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:05,442
'Cause your crazy-ass
daddy was supposed

385
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:07,202
to cut my damn hair, a'ight?

386
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:09,369
And what the hell it
matter anyway, nigga?

387
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:10,988
I'm a regular-ass person.

388
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,579
I need to get my hair cut sometimes.

389
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,432
Famous people need to eat and shit

390
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:16,693
and brush their goddamn teeth!

391
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,915
I'm regular, bruh, all right?

392
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:23,704
Yo, so, um... can you put me on?

393
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,968
What?

394
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:26,889
I got a fire mixtape.

395
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:28,321
I'm like Lonzo Ball.

396
00:16:29,674 --> 00:16:31,508
It's actually pretty good.

397
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:34,864
I'm done, man. Yup.

398
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:36,646
I'm done, bruh. That's it.

399
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:38,997
We done!

400
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:40,848
We done. I'm going back to the shop,

401
00:16:40,873 --> 00:16:42,571
cut his hair 'cause that's
what grown people do...

402
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:44,368
Yo, Lamar! Man, get your ass in the car.

403
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,464
- Come over here.
- Bibby, let's go, man!

404
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
We... Come on, let's go.

405
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:51,379
Take y'all asses to school!

406
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,900
- Pops, I said I was sorry.
- What? Hey! My man,

407
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,944
you don't have to be sorry to me at all.

408
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:04,402
You can save that. I don't care at all.

409
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:06,070
Hey, you got to explain
that to your mama.

410
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:08,439
- Please do not tell Mama. God!
- Don't tell your mama?

411
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:10,141
Well, I'm calling her right now.

412
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:12,484
She got to know. Shit,
she the one wanted you.

413
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:13,018
Bibby...

414
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,351
- Do you have minutes?
- What?

415
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:15,601
- I know. The kids these days, right?
- The road, man...

416
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:18,082
- The road, Bibby.
- I got this. Yeah. See?

417
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:19,769
- Now you got Paper Boi mad.
- Bibby, the road, man.

418
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:21,017
- Why don't you go straight?
- Yeah. I got this!

419
00:17:21,018 --> 00:17:22,477
Nigga, if you kill me, I swear to God,

420
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:24,382
- I'm-a fuck you up, boy.
- It's all good. I got this.

421
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:25,642
Oh, that's it. Him asking me for favors,

422
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,815
you know what I'm talking about?

423
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:28,643
- Can you watch the road?
- These kids these days.

424
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,144
I ask you for favors all the time.

425
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,479
You don't know nothing about nothing!

426
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:32,880
Huh. Shit.

427
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,382
"Son, can you take the trash out?"

428
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,683
- Bibby.
- Huh?

429
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,852
- The road, bruh.
- I-I'm fine.

430
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:41,018
- Damn. "Son, could you please
stop skipping school?" - Bibby.

431
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,309
- "Son, could you not jack off
with my good lotion?" - Bibby.

432
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,851
- Oh, really? Right in front of Paper Boi?
- That kind.

433
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:45,827
- Simple. Simple...
- Bibby. Bibby!

434
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:50,647
- Bibby, man... Fuck!
- Okay. Hey, everybody all right?

435
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:51,310
Lamar, you good?

436
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,017
- Nigga, man...
- I'm fine.

437
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:53,934
Man, I got weed in my
fucking pockets, Bibby!

438
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:55,435
It's okay. Okay. Everybody good.

439
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,537
- Everybody good.
- Get the fuck off me, man.

440
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:58,439
All right. It's good.
Everything good. Hey, listen.

441
00:17:58,475 --> 00:17:59,741
Hey, y'all, this what we gonna do.

442
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:01,442
Hey, hop in the driver's
seat right quick.

443
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:03,851
- Nigga, what?
- I got warrants, man.

444
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,911
- Hop over here right quick.
- Fuck you, man!

445
00:18:04,936 --> 00:18:05,989
I'm on probation, man!

446
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:08,372
- Get his ass up here!
- I don't have a license.

447
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:09,958
It's okay. Hey, it's all good.

448
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:10,852
- It's all good. We good.
- Oh, my God.

449
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:12,597
We good. We good. Listen, see?

450
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:13,601
The driver's still good.

451
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,223
They mobile, at least.

452
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:17,245
Everything fine. We gonna be all right.

453
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:22,897
Oh, shit.

454
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,174
- Oh, goddamn it.
- Nah. Nah, fuck that.

455
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,695
What you doing?

456
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,170
What?! Ah, Bibby, man!

457
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:58,826
Get out, skipper.

458
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:01,209
Damn, with you skipping school.

459
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:09,018
You know, for the record,
I never wanted you.

460
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:10,575
Yo, Alfred!

461
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,101
Hey, Al, let's get
you that haircut, baby.

462
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:15,893
Anybody else pee a little
bit when we had that wreck?

463
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,370
Just me?

464
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,769
Hey, yo, Al, listen.

465
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,467
Hey, sorry about the
hit-and-run thing,

466
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,536
but you know I can't
go back to jail, baby.

467
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,141
I just can't do it.
I don't weigh enough.

468
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:26,477
You know, I'll be somebody
girlfriend immediately in jail.

469
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:28,011
I don't fuck with no jails.

470
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:31,014
Just passing by the Atlanta
pen make my boy-hymen hurt.

471
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,541
Hello?

472
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:34,300
Smooth, what's good, baby?

473
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,553
Oh, no, baby. I ain't busy.

474
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:39,156
You should've been called me.
I got that on me right now.

475
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:41,892
No, I'll bring it to you
right now. Don't be ridiculous.

476
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:44,528
I'm on my way. I'll be right over there.

477
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:47,164
Yeah, I'm on my way. No big deal.

478
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,727
Hey. I left something in my truck.

479
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,976
Let's get you that haircut.

480
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,184
All righty.

481
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:15,425
My man. There you go.

482
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:18,395
See, no problem. Looking good.

483
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,897
Ready.

484
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:25,402
My dawg.

485
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:28,772
Hey, um, you forgot to pay me.

486
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,141
Nigga, you got to be fucking kidding me.

487
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:32,738
Nah. You haven't paid me.

488
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:35,779
You know, you dragged me out of here,

489
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:37,514
ruined my whole goddamn day,

490
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,349
you almost got me in trouble
with the fucking cops,

491
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:42,819
and then you almost killed me
with your goddamn driving, man.

492
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:46,056
Ruined? Nigga, we had a good day today.

493
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:48,704
I took you to mentor to
some kids. You're welcome.

494
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:50,981
And then we-we ate at
that white lady house.

495
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:52,896
And then we hit that
Asian lady from the back,

496
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,115
you know what I'm talking about.

497
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,767
Then we came back up
here, I cut your hair.

498
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,154
I know good and goddamn
well he ain't drop my money.

499
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,500
No tip?

500
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:16,318
This ain't like the other
ones where, you know,

501
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,116
they just put three random
movies together, like Kazaam

502
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:22,943
or, you know, Glitter or
Leprechauns in the Hood.

503
