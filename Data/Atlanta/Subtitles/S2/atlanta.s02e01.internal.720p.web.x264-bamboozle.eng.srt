Oh, hell yeah.

Hey! Hey, that's my shit, man.

Yeah, you can't stay in here

Today.

71
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,421
That doesn't mean
you get to take my shit.

72
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:43,589
You got to auction it off
or something, man.

00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:47,324
Yeah, I watch <i>Storage Wars,</i> too.

74
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,590
This ain't that.

75
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:56,128
Man.

76
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:05,500
What up?

77
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:07,971
Yo.

78
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,007
Hey.

79
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:23,609
What's up, Al?

80
00:07:23,645 --> 00:07:25,012
'Sup?

81
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,479
What'd y'all do last night?

00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:34,148
Went to Edgewood?
Tear the club up?

House arrest.

84
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:38,749
Yeah, I know.

85
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:40,916
I was joking.

86
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:43,484
You want to try one
of these sliders, bro?

87
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,957
Yeah, yeah.

88
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:48,958
Have a seat.

89
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:52,023
Be careful.

90
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:54,828
It's very, very cold.

91
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:58,460
Hey, can you, um,

92
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,461
you still give me a ride
to the P.O.?

93
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:02,194
Oh. Mm-hmm.

94
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,232
Yeah, I'll go and get ready.

95
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:15,468
Hey, Al.

96
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:18,640
What's going on
with you and Darius?

97
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:22,407
I don't want to talk about it.

98
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:27,245
All right.

99
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,608
Hey, Earn.

100
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,573
Hey. What's up, Regina?

101
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,890
My name's Tara.

102
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:37,359
Who's Regina?

103
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:43,456
Uh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I always think that.

104
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:45,026
I know you're Tara. You're Tara.

105
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:48,056
I just...

106
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,782
You remind me of this girl
named Regina

107
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:52,077
I went to high school with.

108
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:54,018
Every time I see you, I'm like,

109
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:56,507
"Tara's not Regina."
It's crazy, 'cause you...

110
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:58,619
She was so cool.

111
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:00,528
Shut up, Earn.

112
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:03,322
Here you go, baby.

113
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:07,614
Darius is ready.

114
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:10,344
Cool.

115
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:14,056
Thank you.

116
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:15,797
Hey.

117
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:18,043
I don't know

118
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,871
what's going on with you two,

119
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:23,634
but I love you both.

120
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:32,969
Nigga, what?

121
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,797
Man, get your boy.

122
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:41,659
He's crazy.

123
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:54,847
Is Tara staying with you guys?

124
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:56,890
Huh?

125
00:09:56,927 --> 00:10:00,570
Is Tara staying over?

126
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:04,217
Is Tara staying o... is Tar...

127
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:06,534
- Is Tara staying over? So...
- Oh.

128
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:09,192
'Cause if she's not, uh, can
I stay over for a little bit?

129
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:10,861
I don't know, man.

130
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:13,454
You got to talk to Al.

131
00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:17,302
Yeah. What's going on
with you two?

132
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:19,725
I don't want to talk about it.

133
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:28,207
How's your parents?

134
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:30,798
Good. Good.

135
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:34,001
They're driving
to Florida right now

136
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:37,714
to visit my uncle who's dying.

137
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:40,644
Oh, Florida, huh?

138
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,647
Better make sure you tell them
to watch out for Florida Man.

139
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,917
What's Florida Man?

140
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:57,480
<i>Florida Man is responsible</i>

141
00:10:57,517 --> 00:10:59,557
<i>for a large percentage
of abnormal incidents</i>

142
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:00,785
<i>that occur in Florida.</i>

143
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:02,011
<i>Think of him as a...</i>

144
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:04,498
<i>alt-right Johnny Appleseed.</i>

145
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:07,565
<i>No one knows his true identity,</i>

146
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:10,189
<i>date of birth,
what he looks like.</i>

147
00:11:10,225 --> 00:11:12,442
<i>That's why headlines
always say, "Florida Man."</i>

148
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:17,520
<i>"Florida Man shoots
unarmed black teenager."</i>

149
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,161
<i>"Florida Man bursts
into ex's delivery room,</i>

150
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:23,719
<i>and fights new boyfriend
as she's giving birth."</i>

151
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:26,444
<i>"Florida Man steals a car,
goes to Checkers."</i>

152
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,216
Fries!

153
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:31,282
<i>"Florida Man beats
a flamingo to death."</i>

154
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,645
<i>"Florida Man found

155
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:38,269
- No. No.
- Yes.

156
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:39,938
- Yes, it's true.
- No.

157
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:43,142
Him, the state government...
fucking cahoots.

158
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,039
Why would anyone even do that?

159
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:48,082
To prevent black people
from coming to

160
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:50,401
and/or registering to vote
in Florida, Earn. Come on.

161
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:51,733
- Of course.
- Yeah.

162
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,112
You want to turn
the music back on?

163
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:01,747
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

164
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:11,327
Earnest Marks.
First-time offender.

165
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,155
Narcotics possession
with intent to sell?

166
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,098
Um, half a joint.

167
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,802
Plus they said the charge
don't even count,

168
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,675
as long as I don't
get charged again.

169
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:22,606
Unless you get arrested again,
not charged.

170
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,583
One's easier than the other.

171
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,682
You've already paid
your entrance fee.

172
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:30,103
Yeah, my jail entrance fee.

173
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,136
We'll need $50 for the mandatory
anti-drug class materials

174
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:35,487
and each class is $25,
so that's...

175
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:38,793
$325 plus the $50,

176
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,438
$375 in total. Are you able
to pay this amount at this time?

177
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:44,244
No.

178
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,505
A payment plan will be set up

179
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:46,767
for the remainder
of your classes.

180
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:48,163
Please pay promptly,
or a warrant

181
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,469
will be issued for your arrest.

182
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:53,547
Would I even have to show up
for these classes

183
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:55,252
if I paid for the whole thing
in full?

184
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:57,367
You can't, so let's not.

185
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:01,453
Take one of those cups
by the door,

186
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,600
fill it up and leave it
in the cupboard.

187
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:05,887
Yes. Thank you.

188
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:15,902
What flavor
is a Flamin' Hot Cheeto?

189
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,985
Hot.

190
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,641
I am tasting hot.

191
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,383
Robbin' Season.

192
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,385
Christmas approaches,

193
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:38,856
and everybody got to eat.

194
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:40,892
Or be eaten.

195
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:48,537
Hey, what's up?

196
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:50,305
Yo, where you at?

197
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:51,908
I'm with Darius.
We're on our way back.

198
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:54,645
Hold on, let me put you
on speaker.

199
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:57,749
<i>Nigga, take me off speaker.</i>

200
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,250
Yeah.

201
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:01,990
Yo, I need you to go over
to Willy's.

202
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:03,558
<i>Why, what's wrong?</i>

203
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,393
That Yvonne done called here
screaming,

204
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,229
saying he done
kidnapped her and shit.

205
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:08,798
She done called the police.

206
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:12,471
<i>Look, just go over there and
make sure he good, all right?</i>

207
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:14,506
<i>Earn, you got it?</i>

208
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:17,947
- Yeah, I got it.
- <i>All right. Peace.</i>

209
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:24,587
Can you drop me off somewhere?

210
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:25,994
Yup.

211
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,817
- I'll be back.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

212
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:47,353
You mind if I come
in here with you, bro?

213
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:49,957
The vibes here
are just so intense.

214
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:52,860
Yeah, I got something
for your ass. Yeah, I got...

215
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:54,563
Sure.

216
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:11,254
I'm not playing with you.

217
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,163
Who is it?!

218
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:20,167
It's Earn.

219
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:34,689
Take your shoes off.

220
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:41,698
Y'all can't sleep here.

221
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:43,299
We're not staying here.
Where's Yvonne?

222
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:45,904
That the police?

223
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,642
Bitch, you better hope
it ain't the police.

224
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:51,779
Did you lock...

225
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,550
Did you lock her in there?

226
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,652
This is my house.

227
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:58,922
I'm supposed to be asking you,

228
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,726
- "What is you doing here?"
- Yeah, Al sent me.

229
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,630
He too good to come see me now
on his own? He DMX now?

230
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,800
No, he's on house arrest.
Yvonne called.

231
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:08,236
Said she was kidnapped.

232
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:11,139
Did he happen to mention to you

233
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:15,346
that that thieving,
raggedy bitch stole $50

234
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:17,149
out of my pocket
while I was sleeping?

235
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,919
I did not, Willy.

236
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:20,920
Well, where, pray tell,
is it, then, Yvonne?

237
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:22,857
We the only two
motherfuckers in here.

238
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:24,259
- Did it walk out the door?
- I don't know.

239
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:25,928
Maybe your stupid ass
drank the $50.

240
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:28,299
I ain't drank shit. Okay?

241
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,367
I ain't never drank
no $50 in my life.

242
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,137
The fuck she talking about?

243
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:33,806
She said kidnapping
when she called, okay?

244
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:36,643
Kidnapping's serious.
You know that, right? Willy?

245
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,347
Well, I must've kidnapped
that bitch in 1974,

246
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:41,217
'cause she ain't been a kid
in 45 years.

247
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:42,886
She in there?

248
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:46,289
No, and don't go in there.
The alligator's in there.

249
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:49,228
- What?
- Hmm. Vibes.

250
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:52,565
Mmm, there's an
alligator in there, for real.

251
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:57,305
Give me the keys.

252
00:16:57,341 --> 00:17:00,010
It's gonna take me a while
to be able to find the keys.

253
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,346
They're right there
in front of you.

254
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:13,930
Hey, uh... I-I would say
nice to meet you,

255
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,332
but I don't believe
in time as a concept,

256
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,541
so... I'll just say
we always met.

257
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:32,022
- The police here?
- You call them?

258
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:34,693
No. But Patty next door...

259
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:36,298
she quick to call.

260
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,770
I don't know if you
remember what you said

261
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:43,973
on the phone,
but kidnapping is a felony,

262
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,641
and if you tell that
to the police,

263
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:47,911
we're in a lot of trouble.

264
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:51,650
- You take that $50?
- Fuck you, Earn.

265
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:54,257
I didn't take shit.

266
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:00,596
Give this to Willy.

267
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:02,632
But make sure he gives you
your change first.

268
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:04,636
If you took his $50,

269
00:18:04,672 --> 00:18:07,476
give it back and keep this $100.

270
00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:11,149
Thank Alfred.

271
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:16,318
Was that alligator here
when I was staying here?

272
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:19,155
Who? Coach? Yeah.

273
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:25,536
Oh, shit. Shit.
I-I didn't call them.

274
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,442
Tired of motherfuckers
knocking on my door

275
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:35,881
- like they the police. Wha...?
- Are you the resident here?

276
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,716
Man, what y'all want?

277
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:40,019
We were called
about a domestic disturbance.

278
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:41,622
No. No.

279
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:43,492
No, that's the wrong house.
We are not domestic.

280
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:45,160
- We not even married.
- W-We didn't call, Officer.

281
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:46,329
We-we good.

282
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:47,898
Ma'am, do you live here?

283
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,366
No. She don't live here.

284
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:50,834
I'm fucking the bitch.
That's the deal.

285
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,338
- Okay? No crime.
- We were called.

286
00:18:52,374 --> 00:18:54,172
Negative. Please step out
into the lawn.

287
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,043
I'm gonna leave
the safety of my house

288
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,979
to step out on the lawn
with y'all for no reason?

289
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:00,149
I ain't... No. No. No.

290
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:02,317
I'm not finna do that.
I know how the law work.

291
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:03,653
If you're trying to arrest me,

292
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,321
you got to get
a complaint from her,

293
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:07,525
and then it's got to be
filled out and signed.

294
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,361
- That's how the law works.
- No, sir.

295
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:10,696
That's not how it works.

296
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,366
Comply or we will
put you in cuffs.

297
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,268
Put me in what?

298
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:16,404
Willy, you-you-you better
go on and talk to them.

299
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,349
I'm not talking to these
sons of bitches about nothing,

300
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:20,855
'cause I ain't do nothing.

301
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:22,533
And if they keep on
trying to act like

302
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,936
they're gonna come in here
and get me,

303
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:25,511
then I'll let
that alligator loose and

304
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:27,839
- see what they do about that.
- You don't have an alligator.

305
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,303
- Yes, he do!
- He do got an alligator.

306
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,639
That's the alligator man.

307
00:19:31,676 --> 00:19:34,720
Them children
ain't lying to you.

308
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,877
I'm the alligator man. Okay?

309
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:40,541
So, now, just leave me alone,

310
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:43,245
won't be no gator.
All right?

311
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:44,579
We'll shoot your
goddamn alligator.

312
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,319
Well, do it. I want to see it!

313
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:48,414
Do it!

314
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:49,886
I don't know what
you trying to pull.

315
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,360
All I know is I ain't got

316
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:55,228
to do shit
'cause I ain't done shit.

317
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:57,525
Kiss my black ass.

318
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,766
Hey, how's it going?
That's my uncle.

319
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:03,580
He's a veteran.
Please don't shoot him.

320
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:06,526
Hey, look, we need him to step
out here or we will tase him.

321
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:07,962
I know, I get it.
I-I don't want this

322
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,606
to become a big thing, okay?
Just give me five minutes,

323
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,796
I'll talk to him.
He's not dangerous.

324
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,612
He's-he's just unstable,
all right?

325
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:16,731
Hey... is there an alligator
in there?

326
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:19,401
Yeah.

327
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:22,277
Is he friendly with you?

328
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:26,759
No.

329
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:28,572
Five-Five minutes.

330
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:31,349
- Just give me five minutes.
- Shit.

331
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:36,280
Willy, you got to get out there.
I don't want shit to get crazy.

332
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:40,045
I don't know, it's already crazy
up in here, bro.

333
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:42,271
This nigga got a full-grown
caiman in here

334
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,393
surrounded by chicken carcasses.

335
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,447
Shit's like an Azealia Banks
Snapchat.

336
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:49,700
I'm on probation.
I can't go to jail, all right?

337
00:20:49,737 --> 00:20:51,685
If there's gonna be a shootout,
I need to get out of here.

338
00:20:51,722 --> 00:20:54,252
A shootout?

339
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,999
Nigga, I'm not crazy.

340
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:57,269
I'm not Florida Man.

341
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,759
I just know the law.

342
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:03,668
As long as I didn't do shit, all
I got to do is stay in my house.

343
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:05,755
Look, I don't know
if you're high right now,

344
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:07,262
but you're getting on
my last nerve.

345
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,495
Uh-oh.

346
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:09,865
Fulton County has no problem

347
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,267
coming in here
and cuffing all of us.

348
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,467
Okay? Don't be a...

349
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:13,767
Oh, hoo-hoo.

350
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:15,240
Don't be an idiot.

351
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:17,773
How you trying to tell me
about myself?

352
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,793
You're homeless, Earn.
You don't even have

353
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,467
a mirror to look at yourself.

354
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,503
Here.

355
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,280
I know you all about
your principles...

356
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:33,727
...but can we just please,
just listen to Earn

357
00:21:33,764 --> 00:21:35,952
so we can get out of here.
It's four cops

358
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:37,665
on the other side of that door.

359
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:39,170
You know if they come in here,

360
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:41,467
they're gonna get your ass
on a whole lot of other shit.

361
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:48,073
You lying-ass bitch.

362
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,578
- I knew it.
- You mother...

363
00:21:49,615 --> 00:21:51,017
Mama, I hate you, Willy.

364
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:53,413
Don't you never come back
to my house no more.

365
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,604
And I hope they blow
your motherfuckin' ass

366
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:57,588
- to smithereens.
- You better hope they do, bitch.

367
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,720
You better hope they do.

368
00:21:58,757 --> 00:22:02,078
This nigga kidnapped me.

369
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:07,003
What the hell is wrong with you?

370
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,332
Really, man? Huh?

371
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,318
What are you wilin' out for?

372
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:14,433
- You on probation. Just leave a nigga.
- Nah.

373
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,665
The person who owns this house

374
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,210
said I had to make sure
you were okay.

375
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:21,759
Uh-huh.

376
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:24,190
You scared.

377
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:27,033
You got to stay
on his good side now.

378
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,491
'Cause he's Mr. Moneybags.

379
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:32,374
Remember, Uncle Jarvis
used to manage Damon

380
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:33,948
when he was in that group.

381
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,304
Now they don't even talk
no more.

382
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:40,145
'Cause you find out family
<i>is</i> business.

383
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:41,582
No, that's not it.

384
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,396
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

385
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,246
What I'm scared of is being you.

386
00:22:45,283 --> 00:22:48,464
You know, someone everybody knew
was smart, but ended up being

387
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,823
a know-it-all, fuck-up jay that
just let shit happen to him.

388
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:56,852
Damn.

389
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,677
Uh, see, the vibe here

390
00:23:04,713 --> 00:23:07,086
is just feeling more and more
like jail.

391
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:09,530
So I'm gonna...

392
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:12,176
Yeah, I'll meet you in the car.

393
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:14,722
- Cool. Cool.
- Cool.

394
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:20,358
I didn't do shit.

395
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,393
Willy.

396
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:27,277
Willy.

397
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,854
I meant what I said,
but I'm sorry I said it.

398
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:45,132
If that makes any sense.

399
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:52,390
I am scared about Al leaving me.

400
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:55,307
He don't need me
like that anymore.

401
00:23:55,344 --> 00:23:57,343
He's...

402
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,197
He's kind of a big deal.

403
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:27,683
I'm still mad at you about
what happened with my mom.

404
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:31,623
That's why I had what I said
locked and loaded.

405
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:41,392
You're gonna need this
in the music business.

406
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:44,547
Take it.

407
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,584
I'm not taking that.

408
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,621
Nigga, I'm not asking you.

409
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:50,491
There's police all over
this house.

410
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,242
You want to help Al or not?

411
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,745
And if you don't want
to end up like me,

412
00:25:10,782 --> 00:25:14,344
get rid of that
"chip on your shoulder" shit.

413
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,655
It's not worth the time.

414
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:49,064
That's what I'm telling you,
there's a goddamn alligator...

415
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,983
Yeah, I-I couldn't get him out.

416
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:58,188
He's all yours.

417
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,397
Willy! You coming out?

418
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:05,183
- I'm going in.
- Wait.

419
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:47,226
Where's Willy?

420
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,351
What's up, man?

421
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:16,252
How's Willy?

422
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:18,390
Not in jail.

423
00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:19,746
Hmm.

424
00:27:19,782 --> 00:27:21,921
Want some?

425
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:29,455
Yeah.

426
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,981
The fuck?

427
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:47,301
What the fuduck is that?

428
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:49,269
It's a gun.

429
00:27:49,306 --> 00:27:51,374
Willy gave it to me.

430
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,663
Nigga, and you took it?

431
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,530
Yeah. You told me to help him.

432
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:55,751
I was helping him.

433
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:57,450
Yo, so let me get this straight.

434
00:27:57,486 --> 00:27:59,689
You're holding a gun for a nigga

435
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:01,487
while 12 outside.

436
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:04,134
That shit gold.

437
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,950
Yo-yo, can you stash this
for a little bit over here?

438
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,418
You better get rid of that gun,
nigga.

439
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,690
Who-who are you?

440
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:19,235
Oh, man.
That's my boy Tracy, man.

441
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:23,071
- He got out today.
- Yeah. What's up, man?

442
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:25,242
You-you staying here?

443
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,534
Goddamn! Is you the landlord
or something?

444
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:35,592
That gold shit.

445
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:38,307
Yeah, um... I'm out of here.

446
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:40,174
I'll-I'll see you.

447
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,651
Ah, that shit gold.

448
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:45,841
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, Earn.

449
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:47,877
You good?

450
00:28:47,913 --> 00:28:50,219
Yeah. I'm good.

451
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:51,783
All right, I'll catch you.

452
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,479
Peace, man.

453
00:28:55,516 --> 00:28:57,077
Peace.
