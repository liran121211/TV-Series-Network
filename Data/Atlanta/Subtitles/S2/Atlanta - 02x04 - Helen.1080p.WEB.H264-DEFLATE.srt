1
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:43,350
Are you getting paranoid?

2
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,688
You're paranoid, huh?

3
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,085
No. I just don't think
you're gonna like it up there.

4
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:49,152
Where, Helen?

5
00:00:49,254 --> 00:00:50,900
I've been there before.

6
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:51,985
Fourth grade. Field trip.

7
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,803
Tamika Rich threw up.

8
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:57,160
No, the festivities, Fastnacht.

9
00:00:57,262 --> 00:00:58,657
It's really traditional.

10
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:01,350
Oh. Well,

11
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,345
if we don't like it, we can
just go back to the lodge,

12
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:04,935
and do lodge stuff.

13
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:06,919
"Lodge stuff"?

14
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:09,252
Yeah, lodge stuff.

15
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,435
I know it sounds gross,

16
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:12,768
but it's pretty much what
we were doing this morning.

17
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:16,864
And you'll be high, so you'll
have more tongue confidence.

18
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:19,124
You notice that?

19
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:24,643
Now I'm paranoid.

20
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:30,353
This is gonna sound like a
high question, but it's not.

21
00:01:30,378 --> 00:01:31,911
Got it.

22
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:35,540
Are black women considered brunettes?

23
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,174
Is it weird that made me hungry?

24
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:03,896
You, too?

25
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:14,975
Oh, shit.

26
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:21,309
This is nice.

27
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,975
We're gonna be the only
black people here, aren't we?

28
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:25,688
Christina's half.

29
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:29,060
The important thing
is the Faschingstanz,

30
00:02:29,193 --> 00:02:31,111
and make sure you mix in
some actual dance moves

31
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:34,197
with the traditional
ones. They'll love that.

32
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,933
- All right.
- We're gonna win for sure.

33
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:38,101
Christina's gonna be so mad,

34
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:40,003
'cause Dave can't dance for shit.

35
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:42,772
I'm not that great, either.

36
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:44,951
I don't know. You got some swag.

37
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:47,143
It's weird swag, but people like it.

38
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:51,914
Oh, by the way, traditionally,
there's a moor character

39
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:53,950
that people show up in blackface, so...

40
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:55,761
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:57,654
When you were a kid,
didn't you feel, like,

42
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,442
weird about all that?

43
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,024
Hmm, I used to.

44
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:04,391
But I'm kind of like the Serena
Williams of the festivities.

45
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:06,929
They hate, but they
can't deny the stats.

46
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:08,731
You're so competitive.

47
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:11,720
I know. And you love it.

48
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,201
Hey, baby.

49
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:24,090
Hey!

50
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:25,982
- Oh, my God. Hi.
- It is so good to see you.

51
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:27,684
- What's up, Van? How are you?
- Hey, Dave.

52
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,017
I'm good. Ha, look.

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,086
- Hey, yo!
- Amazing.

54
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:31,287
- That looks good.
- Love it.

55
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:33,559
- Look at you.
- Look, I told you she'd dress up.

56
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,582
Earn.

57
00:03:34,652 --> 00:03:35,992
Earn!

58
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:37,694
You want to take our picture?

59
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,961
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, um...
- Huh.

60
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,798
There we go.

61
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,999
- I took three.
- Thank you.

62
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:44,701
Where is your costume?

63
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,216
Oh, yeah. That's not me.

64
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,274
I'm not really into...

65
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:48,671
Y-Yeah, but you got to dress up, man.

66
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:51,307
I mean, like, why are you here?

67
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,726
- Look at me. I'm wearing lederhosen, dawg.
- Yeah.

68
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:55,453
I-I get it. I don't know.

69
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:56,979
Van likes it.

70
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:58,935
- Where-where'd she go, though?
- Yo.

71
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:00,049
- I got a spare mask in the whip.
- I'm...

72
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:01,818
- I'm all right, man.
- You sure?

73
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,852
- I'm sure, man.
- You'd look good in it.

74
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:04,810
I feel good like this.

75
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,258
What the hell is that?

76
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,886
It's a Schnappviecher.
It's a demon thief.

77
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,590
Every Fastnacht, he steals something

78
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:16,278
from one unlucky villager.

79
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:18,309
No way!

80
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,088
You look so good!

81
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:24,935
Oh.

82
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:31,347
You look great... and I'm sorry.

83
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,427
Where's that mask you
were talking about?

84
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:39,632
Yeah, it's in the whip.

85
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:40,690
Cool.

86
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,726
Welcome to another Fastnacht.

87
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:44,761
Here, take these, please.

88
00:04:44,863 --> 00:04:45,828
- Game on.
- Thank you.

89
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,697
We've got some excellent prizes tonight,

90
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,031
provided by Dixie Gas.

91
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:52,379
Big shout-out to Dixie Gas
for these two movie gift cards.

92
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:59,652
And I don't know about the rest of you,

93
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:01,477
but I'm ready to Hootz-Kutz.

94
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:10,269
Just bounce the ball
to me when it comes,

95
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:13,741
but don't say "Hootz-Kutz"
unless you have to. Okay.

96
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,736
- He's never played.
- Okay, okay.

97
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:17,892
Are we ready to Hootz-Kutz?

98
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,225
Yeah!

99
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:22,518
On-on my count. Ready,

100
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,206
set, go.

101
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,184
- Oh!
- Come on, Earn.

102
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:30,934
You're supposed to catch it, okay?

103
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,090
- I'm sorry. All right, sorry.
- It's okay.

104
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,844
Go.

105
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:37,447
There it is!

106
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:41,751
We're supposed to pass them.

107
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,601
- Don't just...
- Oh, my God!

108
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:45,888
Switch!

109
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:48,352
Hold, hold.

110
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:57,967
Thank you.

111
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:00,252
Earn, you're just standing there, dude.

112
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,409
Earn.

113
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:02,851
- Earn, don't just stand there.
- Earn.

114
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:06,435
What'd you... whoa, whoa. Whoa.

115
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,055
Whoa. That was crazy.

116
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,679
How'd you do that?

117
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:12,187
I just put the...

118
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:13,683
I just held the balls
and put them in the jug.

119
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:15,210
Shh, no, no. No, hold on.

120
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,601
I've been playing Hootz-Kutz

121
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:19,351
since I was a little kid, and I've...

122
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:21,019
I've never seen anyone do that.

123
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:23,713
Shit, dude.

124
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:28,476
No, seriously, man.
How-how did you do that?

125
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,392
I just held the balls
and-and put them in the jug.

126
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:39,627
Oh, my goodness.

127
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:47,653
Earnest "Halten" Marks!

128
00:06:47,694 --> 00:06:49,519
Give it up for Earn!

129
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,292
Earn! Earn!

130
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,887
Earn! Earn! Earn! Earn! Earn!

131
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:07,893
What's "halten"?

132
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,478
It just means "to hold."

133
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:11,370
You really should learn German.

134
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,843
Yeah, I know. It's so useful.

135
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,894
You got lucky as fuck back there.

136
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,919
You should listen to me next time.

137
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,517
You're starting to sound more
like Serena Williams's dad.

138
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,040
Hello.

139
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:24,631
What can I get you?

140
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:25,688
- Wow.
- Uh...

141
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:33,629
No.

142
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:35,765
Okay.

143
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:39,602
Did you understand that?

144
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:41,537
No.

145
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,796
Okay.

146
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,778
The mask, maybe...?

147
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,580
Mm... yeah.

148
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,627
Ding, ding. How about some service?

149
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,614
Wow.

150
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:20,186
Here you go.

151
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:52,059
There's always gonna be more girls, man.

152
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:53,774
I get that, but...

153
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,825
But how are you supposed
to know what you want

154
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,816
the rest of your life right now?

155
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:00,114
Sometimes I feel like
she wants me to be lame.

156
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:02,909
I mean, like, this
isn't me. I mean, like...

157
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:05,101
You know, I don't know, maybe she wants

158
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:06,988
a guy who could speak German.
You know what I'm say...

159
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,725
A guy who enjoys dancing to polka music.

160
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:12,159
I'm not that dude.

161
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:15,601
I-I don't know why she wants me
to pretend like I'm that dude.

162
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:18,976
Well, she just, you know, wants
to spend more time with you,

163
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:21,069
and that's what girls
do when they like you.

164
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,760
They just want to twist
their life up with yours.

165
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,226
That way, it's harder to disconnect.

166
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:25,183
- Hey.
- Hey.

167
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,042
Um, so, the guys are
dancing in three minutes.

168
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:29,760
You want to go over some moves?

169
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:32,747
Yeah, actually, let's
go over here for a sec.

170
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:34,849
Okay.

171
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:43,952
Ping-Pong.

172
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:48,059
No. This is obviously a
traditional Pingen-Pong...

173
00:09:48,094 --> 00:09:49,263
- tablisch...
- Tischtennisplatte.

174
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:52,664
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:53,781
Yeah, I was just thinking

176
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,547
we could spend some
one-on-one time together.

177
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:59,351
Can we spend some
one-on-one time dancing?

178
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:01,809
It's just one game.

179
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,469
Come on. It's the
only white game I know.

180
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:11,560
Okay. But one game.

181
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:13,457
If I win,

182
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,756
no more complaining.

183
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,429
We dance

184
00:10:17,454 --> 00:10:20,895
and my name is on the
front of the trophy.

185
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,533
- Fair.
- Okay.

186
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:24,603
- And if I win...
- Mm...

187
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:26,510
- Come on.
- Oh.

188
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:28,228
- Mm, mm. Mm-hmm.
- Okay, well,

189
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,148
don't be upset when you're
in a weird sexual position.

190
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:32,039
You need a warm-up? Come on.

191
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:33,941
Let's go. Best out of three.

192
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:35,009
Ready?

193
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:37,645
- Okay.
- Ready?

194
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:42,225
Baby, I thought you used to play.

195
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:43,951
Yeah, okay.

196
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:45,353
Come on.

197
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,158
Come on, Serena. Let's
do it. You got it.

198
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:01,101
Fuck.

199
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:04,105
That's two out of three, baby.

200
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,173
Mm-hmm. Come on.

201
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:09,131
Let's go dancing. It's match point.

202
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:11,356
Why'd you do that?

203
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:14,101
What're you talking
about? This was your idea.

204
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,360
Yeah, but when we play basketball,

205
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:17,918
I don't just destroy you
in front of everybody.

206
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,823
There's nobody here.
They're all dancing.

207
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,894
Oh, my God.

208
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:31,388
I'm sorry. Was he here the whole time?

209
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,017
He was standing right next to me?

210
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,005
Let's go. Come on. You lost. Let's go.

211
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:39,840
I'm-I'm not in the mood.

212
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,648
Seriously?

213
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:48,368
You're being a fucking baby.

214
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:52,184
Fine. I'll do it if I fucking have to.

215
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:53,330
This is typical.

216
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:56,800
- Whatever.
- Wait. Hold up. I'm sorry. What?

217
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:58,989
I said I'll do it if we fucking have to.

218
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,309
You don't have to do shit.

219
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:04,060
We do your shit all the fucking time.

220
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:05,286
We went to a strip club.

221
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:07,395
- You liked the strip club.
- I liked going to a strip club?

222
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,526
I'm a woman. I need to go
fucking look at titties?

223
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,809
- Then just say you don't enjoy it.
- No.

224
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:14,041
- You didn't like that.
- I want to just spend time with you.

225
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,142
- It doesn't matter to me.
- Well, I was trying

226
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,707
- to fucking spend time with you.
- I wanted to go dancing.

227
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,560
It's fucking stupid.

228
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,790
I don't like it.

229
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:23,856
But you can't do it for me?

230
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,821
I'm not trying to go to
fucking Alfred's concerts

231
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:27,922
every fucking weekend.

232
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:29,056
I wouldn't shit on that.

233
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:30,925
That's paying your fucking bills.

234
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:34,920
Wow.

235
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:36,193
Yeah.

236
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:45,810
You can be real mean, man.

237
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:57,684
Fuck you.

238
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:06,609
♪ One: don't pick up the phone,
you know he's only calling ♪

239
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:08,193
♪ 'Cause he's drunk and alone ♪

240
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,376
Where'd Earn go?

241
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:15,067
Ugh. He's being a baby.

242
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:17,915
I don't understand what...

243
00:13:18,476 --> 00:13:19,642
he wants from me.

244
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,234
- Christina. Oh, my God.
- Oh! Hi.

245
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,460
- How are you, Flo?
- It's so good to see you. So good!

246
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:25,151
- I'm so glad you're here.
- What's going on?

247
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:26,612
Oh, just everything.

248
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:28,527
- Yeah?
- I know. It's so good to see you.

249
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:31,027
- It's so good to see you, too.
- Did you see Jen here?

250
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,573
I vaguely remember. I think I saw her.

251
00:13:32,598 --> 00:13:34,265
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! Oh.

252
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:37,353
This is Flo. Flo, this is Lottie's mom.

253
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:38,851
Oh, my God.

254
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:40,632
So nice to finally meet you.

255
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:43,218
- Mm-hmm.
- Kai is in love with Lottie.

256
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:45,844
She's just so polite and
sweet when she's at our house.

257
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:47,682
Oh. She better be.

258
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:49,798
Uh, hi. I'm Tek.

259
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:51,516
- It's nice to meet you.
- You, too.

260
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,317
Babe, this is Lottie's mom.

261
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,691
- Right. Okay, Earn's girl.
- Yes.

262
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:58,526
- Yes.
- Right. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.

263
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,945
You know, Earn's making
some really cool moves

264
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,857
with Paper Boi. People
are really impressed.

265
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:03,781
- Thank you.
- So...

266
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:05,062
Tek hears all the tea at the label.

267
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,109
Yeah, a lot of tea.

268
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:08,839
I handle his publishing.

269
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:10,428
So, do you work with Earn,

270
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:12,419
or you an artist?

271
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:15,940
No, I'm sort of in
between things right now.

272
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:18,003
I stay at home mostly.

273
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,734
Oh, she used to be a teacher.

274
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:22,023
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

275
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:23,180
You're so lucky.

276
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,068
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

277
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:30,738
Babe. What's going on?

278
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:31,956
- Wait. W-W-Wait.
- I just need a drink.

279
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:33,057
No. No, no, no, no, no.

280
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,191
Let-Let's sit down.

281
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:35,993
Let's sit... No, no, no, seriously.

282
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,365
Come. Sit down.

283
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,968
It's gonna be fine.

284
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:43,511
What's going on?

285
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,901
I don't know why you
have to introduce me

286
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:48,469
as Lottie's mom.

287
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:50,869
- You know my first name.
- Yeah, but...

288
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:52,000
And that's not all that I'm gonna be

289
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,352
for the rest of my
life, is Lottie's mom.

290
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:57,693
Of course not. I know that.

291
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,899
But you make that shit look good.

292
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:02,851
Like, it's different for you.

293
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:04,913
What do you... what do you mean?

294
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,123
You know, it just seems like something

295
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:09,026
that you're more ready for.

296
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:13,690
- What do you mean?
- Because...

297
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,887
you know, like, you chose Earn.

298
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:20,004
I chose Dave.

299
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:25,050
Mm-hmm.

300
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,149
Yeah, like, since we were kids.

301
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:29,030
Like, I chose white.

302
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:30,855
You chose black. Like, it's...

303
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:33,084
Okay.

304
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:35,811
- No.
- You... Yeah.

305
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:38,370
I didn't choose black.

306
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:42,179
Yes, you did.

307
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:44,767
You never hung out with me and Melanie

308
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:45,859
when we invited you.

309
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:48,258
And you only went to the black parties.

310
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:49,382
I mean...

311
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:51,484
it's like you needed that identity.

312
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:52,732
Yeah, but you...

313
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,601
But Melanie was never nice to me.

314
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:57,693
Well, I mean,

315
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:59,639
you never invited me to your parties.

316
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,841
That's because, um,

317
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:06,198
you always acted like
you were better than us,

318
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:08,661
and you would pander to us

319
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:11,644
and say shit like, "I
wish I had kinky hair."

320
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:14,203
Which you do. You
just... you straighten it.

321
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,735
So it's, like, weird
to... it's weird to say.

322
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,157
- Do you know what I mean?
- I didn't, and I think

323
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:19,869
- you're going way too far.
- What?

324
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:21,430
- Like, seriously?
- You literally just told me

325
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,438
that I'm gonna be a baby mama,

326
00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:25,407
and that's okay because I "chose black."

327
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:26,310
Well, of course...

328
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,213
- Are you serious?
- Babe!

329
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:28,609
We won, babe!

330
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:31,609
- Will you take a pic? My phone's died.
- Yeah.

331
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,205
Yay.

332
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:35,841
Shit. I don't know where my phone is.

333
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:37,360
I thought I had it.

334
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:38,811
- I just had it.
- For real? Really?

335
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:41,066
- Yeah.
- Did someone get Schnapped?

336
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,718
It is now the witching hour.

337
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,886
Who here has been struck

338
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:49,159
- by the Schnappviecher?
- Right here!

339
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:50,489
Right here!

340
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:52,491
Wudeljagd!

341
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:56,131
Wudeljagd!

342

00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:10,776
_

358
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:15,268
_

359
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:17,283
_

360
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,817
_

361
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:22,984
Okay.

362
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,533
Hello?

363
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,610
Hi.

364
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:06,110
_

365
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:08,600
You find it?

366
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:11,837
Uh-huh.

367
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:15,359
Vanessa Keifer is this year's warrior!

368
00:20:34,743 --> 00:20:36,495
You want a rematch?

369
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,318
What do you want?

370
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,771
A rematch.

371
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:49,541
I mean in our relationship.

372
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:53,572
This feels like a trap.

373
00:20:53,597 --> 00:20:55,864
It's not a trap.

374
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,752
No bullshit. What do you want?

375
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,627
You want me to go first?

376
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,596
Please.

377
00:21:10,698 --> 00:21:12,698
I want to be...

378
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:14,984
in a committed relationship

379
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,526
where I'm valued as a human being

380
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:20,883
and not as an accessory
that you can fuck.

381
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:28,901
That's a good answer.

382
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:32,896
Um...

383
00:21:35,373 --> 00:21:37,673
I don't know what I want. I...

384
00:21:37,982 --> 00:21:42,394
I know this... arrangement works for me.

385
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:48,596
So it works for you.

386
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:53,234
So, you don't want to change anything?

387
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:58,477
This definitely feels like a trap.

388
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:03,382
I don't want to keep
having this conversation.

389
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,942
I'm really tired.

390
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:08,675
Well, we don't have to
have this conversation now.

391
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,832
We can talk about it in the morning.

392
00:22:09,857 --> 00:22:12,875
Well, I don't want to keep
waiting around for you.

393
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:17,901
And I don't want you to
waste any more of your time.

394
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,637
Then let's settle it.

395
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:31,735
If I win,

396
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:34,855
you only have to see me if
it's about Lottie or money.

397
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:37,161
That's not what I meant.

398
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:38,685
Then beat me.

399
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:43,856
I don't see what this is gonna prove.

400
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:46,972
It's gonna prove that I'm tired.

401
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,650
All right.

402
00:22:57,738 --> 00:22:58,985
Best of five.

403
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,353
Sorry.

404
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:34,733
Um, I'll pick up Lottie
from my mom's house.

405
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:36,482
Tomorrow.

406
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:44,436
All right. Bye.

407
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:04,967
