1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,125
Hey, y'all.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,420
So, tonight I'm wearing my
jasmine brandy lip plump.

3
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:05,678
And y'all can use a
discount code to get it,

4
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:09,460
so you can be... mwah...
twinkling like your girl here.

5
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:12,460
And what better way to bust it
out than a night with my girls?

6
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:13,876
This is my girl Van.

7
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:14,854
Say hi, Van.

8
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:16,972
That's Van.

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,527
She cute or whatever, and I
need a new Netflix password,

10
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:22,328
so hook a girl up.

11
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,396
All right, bye.

12
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:24,464
No free pictures.

13
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,699
Anyway, y'all stay tuned.

14
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:29,369
'Cause tonight the
stars are gonna be out.

15
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:33,306
I dropped this phone
in the tub with Lottie,

16
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,388
and now it just does not hold a charge.

17
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:37,542
Uh-uh, no, we not talking about Lottie,

18
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,456
we not talking about children,
we talking about liquor,

19
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:40,708
- we talking about...
- Liquor.

20
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,460
- ♪ Lick 'em and stick 'em ♪
- ♪ Lick 'em ♪

21
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,792
- ♪ Stick 'em ♪
- And... - Uh-uh.

22
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,627
- ♪ Stick 'em. ♪
- Tammi, you keep talking like that,

23
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,249
you're gonna have child
number two tonight.

24
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,042
Uh-uh.

25
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,417
- She is.
- I got an IUD to block them K-I-Ds.

26
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:51,854
IUD?

27
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:53,752
You know what, though? Them IUDs work.

28
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:54,948
You know what? Y'all nasty.

29
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:56,362
'Cause I changed my
shit up after Lottie.

30
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:58,031
You know what I'm saying?

31
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,709
Don't get that copper IUD,

32
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:01,876
- 'cause that makes your periods worse.
- What?

33
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,877
- Wait, no, it does?
- I'm good.

34
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:06,293
Mm-hmm.
- What ever happened to condoms?

35
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:07,651
Bitch, how old are you?

36
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,342
- Really. Damn!
- You're still using condoms?

37
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,376
Are you in high school?

38
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,271
You know what?

39
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:14,866
I don't have kids, and I
also don't have HPV, trick.

40
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,417
Oh! Really, y'all
gonna play me like that?

41
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:18,840
Put that in your condom and fuck it.

42
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:21,287
Oh, okay, so DJ said
that he's going to meet us

43
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:22,355
and escort us through and everything,

44
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,456
so we don't look like groupies.

45
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:24,557
Mm.

46
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,293
- What the...?
- You know what?

47
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:29,163
What is your deal with DJ, actually?

48
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:30,796
DJ, girl, that's... He's a tour barber.

49
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:33,001
- He's nothing.
- So, what, you just stringing him along

50
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,186
for an invite to Drake's party?

51
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:37,001
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, no, I'm not stringing him along.

52
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:39,339
I actually only talk business with DJ.

53
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:41,529
So, did you send him selfies? Yes or no.

54
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:44,318
I might've sent him one
or two selfies. Dang.

55
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,974
So you sent him one or two
pictures of your breasts.

56
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:49,027
First of all, my breasts
are already on Tumblr,

57
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:50,334
so he could've already
seen it. And I only sent him

58
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,584
- half a nipple... that don't count.
- Oh.

59
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:53,453
Oh, okay, so he would've
saw them eventually,

60
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55,521
because I know you didn't
have on no business clothes.

61
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:57,667
Everybody can't be a
nun like you, Nadine.

62
00:01:57,692 --> 00:02:00,025
If I'm gonna chase anybody, y'all,

63
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,548
it's gonna be that Aubrey. Uh!

64
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:04,298
'Cause you know, I've
always had a crush on Aubrey.

65
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:05,584
- Uh, you and all the other groupies.
- Aubrey?

66
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,418
- What are you talking about?
- Aubrey.

67
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:09,235
- You don't know him.
- Girl.

68
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,081
- He is fine.
- Fine.

69
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:14,006
And he looks like he
would make a great father.

70
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:16,342
Van! Van, do you hear this madness?

71
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,584
What are we... what
are y'all talking about?

72
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:18,709
You know what? I don't even care;

73
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:19,377
I need a photo with Drake,

74
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:20,667
because my Instagram is weak as fuck.

75
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:22,782
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just being real. My shit...

76
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,293
- look, I got Lottie, Lottie, Lottie...
- Chicken.

77
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:26,552
Lottie, me... chicken...

78
00:02:26,655 --> 00:02:28,421
I know exactly which one
you're talking about...

79
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,446
- Uh-huh.
- Lottie, Lottie, Earn.

80
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:31,251
Delete the Earn.

81
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,334
Oh, yeah, so we can
replace Earn with Drake.

82
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,595
Right.

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,084
- Y'all really think this dress is okay?
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,271
I think it looks good
on you... It's fine.

85
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:41,871
Look, we got to go, okay?

86
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:42,635
Let's have one more shot.

87
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:44,237
Do y'all think I should smoke tonight?

88
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:45,305
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

89
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:47,010
Oh, my God!

90
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:51,177
To partying with my girls.

91
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,246
And IUDs.

92
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:56,482
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

93
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,155
You are not a better
driver after a few drinks.

94
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,501
- I'm a good driver.
- No, you ain't.

95
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:17,115
- Um, Candice.
- Next time we smoke and drive.

96
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,069
Candi, you sure we in the right place?

97
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:22,462
Yeah. Yeah, this is it.

98
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:23,697
- There's nobody here.
- This looks a little sus.

99
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:26,009
No, no, there's gonna
be a shuttle that comes.

100
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,001
- I'm freezing.
- I'm losing my buzz.

101
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,328
Where is everybody?

102
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,088
- Okay, stop complaining.
- We're in the woods, girl.

103
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,876
Follow me. Follow me.

104
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,877
Thi-This way. Follow me.

105
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:36,960
Where in the world?

106
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:38,422
You should've wore pants.

107
00:03:38,873 --> 00:03:40,140
You should not be down here in this...

108
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,932
- Who this nigga?
- Yo, uh, happy New Year.

109
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:43,166
- Ha-Happy New Year.
- Right.

110
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:45,135
Hey, y'all going to that
Drake theme party, right?

111
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:46,904
I-I got this pizza for him.

112
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:47,886
Like, right here.

113
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:50,084
- Cool.
- Y'all have the address?

114
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:51,525
Yo, give me the address,
y'all can have some,

115
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,986
but this pizza has to go inside him.

116
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:54,626
- Oh, oh, the shuttle's over here.
- He needs it.

117
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:55,760
- What kind of pizza?
- This is good pizza.

118
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:58,126
Hey, no, we don't
want your pizza... bye.

119
00:03:58,132 --> 00:04:00,572
Wha... No, no... You
got to put me on, though.

120
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:02,119
Put me on... I got music, too.

121
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,619
Like, we could... we
could work just together.

122
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,055
Put me on. You... come on, bruh!

123
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:06,447
Don't leave me out.

124
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:08,773
Don't leave me out...

125
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:10,969
It's locked.

126
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:13,038
Uh, hey. We're here for the party.

127
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,206
Candice Moxon.

128
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:16,051
Okay, oh, all right,
wait, wait, wait, um...

129
00:04:16,076 --> 00:04:18,877
7-4-3-2-9-9.

130
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:20,112
Oh.

131
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,114
- Ooh.
- Yes.

132
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:24,165
Let's go see Drake.

133
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:34,693
Damn.

134
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:51,743
Hey, are you okay?

135
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:55,981
I'm just so happy.

136
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,884
Y'all pretty.

137
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,986
I'm-a take y'all home with me.

138
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:06,969
Just kidding.

139
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,273
Let's go, ladies.

140
00:05:34,298 --> 00:05:35,638
Gather round, gather round.

141
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:37,067
Come on.

142
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:39,825
We don't have all night.

143
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:41,360
File out.

144
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:43,862
- Oh, my God.
- Good evening.

145
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:44,896
Welcome to paradise.

146
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:46,669
IDs out.

147
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,665
If you are here in
response to the video shoot,

148
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,385
please proceed with
your Ethiopian passport

149
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:51,712
to the photo booth

150
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,001
- to receive your name tag and your costume.
- Okay.

151
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:55,974
This is a residential home.

152
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:57,776
Keep booties on at all times.

153
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,042
These are marble floors.

154
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:02,167
- I am not wearing them booties.
- By the way, happy New Year.

155
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:04,816
Happy New Year!

156
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:06,394
All right, who's first?

157
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,798
Oh. Drake invited me.

158
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:13,735
"Drake invited me."

159
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,594
That's his signature right there.

160
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:23,835
Can I just...

161
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,670
No, you don't have to call him.

162
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:27,217
I, um...

163
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:31,810
I was supposed to be here, not you!

164
00:06:31,912 --> 00:06:33,044
I was invited!

165
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:36,527
I swear, I was invited!

166
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,376
♪ You the, you the best ♪

167
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:39,500
♪ You the, you the... ♪

168
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,573
- This is my song.
- This is my song.

169
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:44,523
Girl, every song is your song.

170
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,459
Look at these Instagram
Stepford Wife-looking bitches.

171
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,208
Oh, look, it's Devyon Johnson.

172
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,428
- Wait, where?
- The actor?

173
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:55,452
Where?

174
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,035
He's cute.

175
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:59,771
He would be with a white girl.

176
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:04,363
These Hollywood niggas are so cliché.

177
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:05,554
Hey.

178
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:08,197
DJ! DJ... hey, DJ, baby.

179
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:09,992
- Hi. Mwah.
- Mwah. What's up, ladies?

180
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:11,883
DJ, next time, can you escort me?

181
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:13,627
Because security was so mean to me.

182
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:15,086
- Oh, yeah, I got you.
- Where's Drake at?

183
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:17,355
- You gonna introduce us?
- Oh, yeah, I want to meet Drake.

184
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,891
Uh, yeah, he's-he's
floating around somewhere.

185
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:21,126
Well, where's this room?

186
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:23,168
- This the VIP room? We want to go here.
- Uh...

187
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:24,996
Okay, okay, well... chill.

188
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:26,798
No, no, it's-it's-it's cool.

189
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,321
W-Well, I got to go DJ.

190
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,600
'Cause my name is D-D-D-D-DJ.

191
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,704
He's funny, right?

192
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:33,492
- He's so...
- No.

193
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,831
Get a drink, I'll hook y'all up.

194
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,578
Oh. You want a gummy?

195
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:38,877
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, yes.

196
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:40,111
- I'm good, thank you.
- Uh.

197
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:42,781
Uh-uh, uh-uh. Uh...

198
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:44,558
Mm-hmm, mm.

199
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,861
She likes gummies.

200
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:47,853
Take the gummy, enjoy yourself.

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,834
Fine.

202
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:49,876
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on.

203
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,956
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

204
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:53,024
Well, ladies, I'm gonna go with DJ.

205
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:54,624
- Ah.
- So, y'all have fun.

206
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:55,861
- Mm.
- It's a party.

207
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:57,508
Bye, Candi.

208
00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:58,647
Look at 'em.

209
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:02,295
Mm-mm.

210
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:04,334
Chew.

211
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,356
Very good.

212
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:11,701
Let's go.

213
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:14,834
- I don't like it.
- Mm-mm-mm.

214
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:23,510
♪ Way up, way up ♪

215
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:30,635

I'm so sorry.

222
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:45,466
It's okay.

223
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:49,551
This edible ain't kicking in fast enough

224
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,924
for me to enjoy this thot-a-thon.

225
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:53,959
Amen.

226
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:57,284
Where is Devyon Johnson?

227
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,675
I just need to talk some sense into him.

228
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:01,754
Just so he knows, you know?

229
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,612
I feel weird.

230
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:05,070
I'm-a go find his ass.

231
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:09,681
Damn, girl, you look high as hell.

232
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:12,878
Nadine, stay with Van.

233
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:17,883
You seem annoyed or something.

234
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:20,486
- Is it Earn?
- No.

235
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:24,189
He's out there living his
life and I'm here living mine.

236
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:26,578
I'm just trying to get
this photo with Drake.

237
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:28,127
I need to strategize.

238
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:30,863
Is it me? A-Are you mad at me?

239
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:33,142
What? No.

240
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,034
You're paranoid. Stop it.

241
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,759
Ugh! I'm just going through stuff,

242
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:42,975
and this dress is just, like...

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,276
I just need to calm down.

244
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,758
I need to have a good time
and I'm just gonna relax.

245
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:48,820
I'm gonna have a good time

246
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:50,912
and I'm gonna have a vodka soda, please.

247
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:54,153
Yes. Is this the police?

248
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,421
I-I need your help.

249
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:59,339
I'm at this big party at
Drake's house and I'm dying.

250
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:01,060
- I-I don't...
- Who are you talking to, baby?

251
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:02,698
- Hello?
- Help.

252
00:10:02,723 --> 00:10:03,973
Did she give you an address?

253
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:05,197
No? Okay, bye.

254
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:07,132
Honey, what's wrong with
you? You're just high.

255
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:08,367
No, I'm dying and I know it.

256
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,169
You are high and you're paranoid.

257
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:11,917
No, I need to go to the hospital.

258
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,683
No. We need to get out of this room,

259
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,301
but we are not leaving.

260
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,008
Just take a sit right here, okay?

261
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:19,677
Why don't you lie down?
You want to lie down?

262
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:21,509
I can't breathe right.

263
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,717
Yes, you can. Come on.

264
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,593
Let's lay you down. All right.

265
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:26,711
Okay. Okay.

266
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:29,413
We're gonna breathe
together like in yoga. Okay?

267
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:31,956
Shit.

268
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:36,060
Um, okay, let's breathe.

269
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,731
Okay?

270
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:43,236
Okay. You keep doing that.

271
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,088
Breathe. I see you breathing, okay?

272
00:10:45,113 --> 00:10:46,275
I'm gonna get some water.

273
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,132
Wait. DJ drugged me.

274
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:50,265
No, no, no, no.

275
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,148
We all ate the same thing. Okay?

276
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:54,874
It's okay. Why don't
you lie down again, okay?

277
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,849
Um, look, it's Drake.

278
00:10:57,951 --> 00:10:59,516
You can hang out with Drake, okay?

279
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,507
Why don't you stay with Drake?

280
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:03,100
I'm-a be right back. Okay? All right.

281
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:10,270
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

282
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,208
- I'm so sorry.
- It-It's all good.

283
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:13,247
- I mean, I...
- I'm sorry.

284
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,599
I was all in the way.

285
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:16,535
No, I'm sorry. I...

286
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:19,541
Um, do you know where I can find,

287
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:23,402
like, a water or something
non-alcoholic or like...

288
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:25,563
Voilà.

289
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,779
Wow. Thank you.

290
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:30,976
You got a bathroom in there, too?

291
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:32,398
I think I could help you out with that.

292
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:34,685
Oh, okay.

293
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:37,588
Um... um...

294
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,691
I'm Brandon, by the way.

295
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:42,159
Oh, I'm Van.

296
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,754
- It's-it's nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

297
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,379
- Nice to meet you.
- Pretty smile.

298
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:48,599
Thank you.

299
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,218
Um... I got to go.

300
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:53,762
My friend is kind of freaking out.

301
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:55,635
I needed to bring her this water, so...

302
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,926
I mean, is-is everything okay?

303
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:59,192
I mean, do you need some
help? I can, I can follow you.

304
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,468
- Um, yeah, sure. Okay.
- Yeah?

305
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:02,718
Yeah. Um...

306
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,534
she's pretty high, though, so...

307
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,550
- Yeah?
- I don't want you to...

308
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,493
Sure she'll be all
right with that water.

309
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:09,163
Where the hell did she go?

310
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:11,259
Oh, was she here? What she look like?

311
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:14,190
Nadine! Shit.

312
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:19,649
Shit. My phone is dead.

313
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:21,707
- Nadine!
- Look, don't worry. I got you.

314
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:23,653
I know a place downstairs
you can charge your phone

315
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:26,105
next to a pretty dope bathroom.

316
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:27,480
- All right? Yeah.
- Really?

317
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:29,142
- Oh, my God. Okay.
- No fear, no fear, no fear.

318
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,516
- Thank you.
- I got you. I got you.

319
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:31,684
She's gonna get us all arrested.

320
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:33,452
Yeah, just right this
way, right down here.

321
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:35,688
Okay.

322
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,292
- Oh, my gosh.
- Don't trip.

323
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,739
That's a... that's a really nice dress.

324
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:45,298
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

325
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,532
- Thank you.
- It's perfect.

326
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:49,259
Wow, so this is, like, his studio?

327
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:51,746
- Yeah, it, uh, looks that way.
- Damn.

328
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,407
Uh-huh.

329
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,872
There's, uh, the power strip.

330
00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:59,997
Oh, thank you.

331
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:04,271
So you, um, you work with Drake?

332
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,387
Nah, uh, Drake's
nutritionist is my cousin.

333
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:10,256
- Oh.
- Yeah, Coop.

334
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,550
- Oh, cool. Cool.
- Yeah.

335
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:15,371
But how'd you know about
his studio down here, then?

336
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:18,338
No, you know... I just, uh...

337
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:23,033
I got here at, like, 8:00,
so I just walked around.

338
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,271
Nobody was here, so...

339
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,257
- Checked out the rooms.
- Uh-huh.

340
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:30,386
- Saw what was in 'em.
- With your friends?

341
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:32,961
Friends? Nah.

342
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:36,182
But you're my friend.

343
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:44,259
Okay. Um... I need to use the bathroom.

344
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:45,908
I'm gonna charge my phone in there.

345
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:48,433
Great. Let me just... let
me show you where it is.

346
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,024
Okay.

347
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,399
Here. Let-let me show
you. It's right over here.

348
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,401
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

349
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:57,924
- Right here.
- Thank you.

350
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:59,672
- Oh, I got it. Thank you.
- You got it?

351
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:01,574
- Yeah. Thank you, though.
- All right. You're welcome.

352
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:04,110
I-I-I'll just...
I'll wait here.

353
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,322
Ugh. Okay!

354
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:08,206
You good?

355
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:10,383
Uh, yeah, I'm good.

356
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,010
You need anything?

357
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,425
You know what? No.

358
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,050
Okay, some toilet paper or...?

359
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,259
Uh, why don't you go get us some weed?

360
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,642
Weed, right.

361
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:24,463
Yeah, I can... I can, I can find that.

362
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:28,534
Um, yeah. Uh... are
you... are you hungry?

363
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:30,369
You want any food while
I'm at it? A d... a drink?

364
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:33,339
- T-Tequila?
- Um, like, food?

365
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:35,192
Maybe some water.

366
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:36,575
Okay. All right. I'll be right back.

367
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,898
- Okay.
- Right back.

368
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:39,822
Take your time.

369
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:44,022
Okay, just...

370
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,009
Drake?

371
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:18,343
Hello?

372
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:36,218
Smells nice.

373
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:18,468
Oh, my God.

374
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:43,227
Is this real?

375
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,910
No.

376
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,267
No, it is not.

377
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:55,820
Hmm. Have you heard of
Bostrom's simulation argument?

378
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,119
No.

379
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:01,584
Basically, it just states
that, uh, future civilizations

380
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:04,320
must have immense computing power

381
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,334
and that if even a fraction of this

382
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,635
were to run ancestral simulation,

383
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:11,351
there's a high probability that
it would be indistinguishable

384
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:16,065
from reality to the
simulated ancestor, i.e. us.

385
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:18,234
What?

386
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:20,793
You're a simulation.

387
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,099
- Oh.
- Like a Sim.

388
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:27,276
There is someone controlling
your every movement.

389
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:30,393
Yeah, I don't even like apples.

390
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,817
Can you help me stop thinking?

391
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:38,221
Perhaps.

392
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,224
Catch.

393
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,067

00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:54,683

- Hey.

505
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:19,816

- Drake.

512
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,434
No, I meant the party. Is Earn with you?

513
00:24:40,484 --> 00:24:44,810
No, but I know Drake's chef, Guillermo,

514
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:47,222
from the glorious
days of pick-up soccer.

515
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:49,341
But how did we get here?

516
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:52,200
Oh, see, that's an even
harder one, actually.

517

- No, shut up.

00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,612
Candice drove us here.

519
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:02,711
And then she ditched
us for T-Pain's party.

520
00:25:02,813 --> 00:25:04,649
That sucks.

521
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:07,687
You okay?

522
00:25:09,904 --> 00:25:11,838
I think so.

523
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:14,998
Me and Darius figured
out that I am nothing.

524
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:17,226
We're all nothing.

525
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:19,568
It's a simulation, Van.

526
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:22,888
It's all fake.

527
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,736
You're right.

528
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:29,004
It's all fake.

529
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:31,906
There's no Drake.

530
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:35,076
So don't ruin your high
and just enjoy yourself.

531
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:40,685
Hmm. You're such a good friend.

532
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:44,785
Hey. Hey.

533
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,188
Hey, y'all. They kicking everybody out.

534
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:50,089
And, Van, what the hell do you got on?

535
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:52,511
Come on, y'all.

536
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,685
How are we getting home?

537
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:15,767
Drake's Mexican.
