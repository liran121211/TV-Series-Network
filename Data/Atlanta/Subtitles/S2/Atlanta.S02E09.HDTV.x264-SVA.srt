1
00:00:03,595 --> 00:00:05,281
Yo, we should probably get moving.

2
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:08,174
You know, the 75 about to be crazy.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,401
Oh, and your fit's on the table.

4
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:12,584
Yeah.

5
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:16,573
Hey, man, if you want this money,

6
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:18,209
we need this college fan base.

7
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:19,186
And, you know,

8
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,205
first it's this, then it's Spring Fling,

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,496
and that's $60K guaranteed.

10
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:31,983
You heard me, right?

11
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:34,225
Nigga, I heard you.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,617
$60K.

13
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:40,548
You do realize I'm trying
to make you more money?

14
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,873
- That's how I make money.
- Look, no shade,

15
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:44,412
but we both got different
standards of living, a'ight?

16
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:46,420
- Yeah, that's true, but obviously...
- Where y'all going?

17
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:47,521
- Oh!
- Oh, fuck, man!

18
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:48,622
Tracy, man, what'd I tell you

19
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:50,813
about breaking in my
goddamn apartment, man?

20
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:52,555
This .38 almost sliced your ass.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,528
But, nigga, you know I'm staying here.

22
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,397
Yeah, but what happened to
"one week," Tracy, man, huh?

23
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:57,713
One week was months ago.

24
00:00:57,738 --> 00:00:58,837
Man.

25
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:03,103
You know what? Whatever, man. Whatever.

26
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,207
Where y'all going?

27
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:08,509
We're going somewhere not fun.

28
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:10,377
We're leaving right now.
It's-it's... We got to leave.

29
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:11,545
- That's funny.
- Right now.

30
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:13,314
'Cause I ain't asked
when. I asked where.

31
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:14,415
Man, we doing a show.

32
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,006
At Statesboro. For free.

33
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:18,352
Yo, let me roll, man.

34
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:19,587
You need security, right?

35
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:22,132
Look, all I need is a hotel floor, bruh.

36
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:23,256
We're not staying in a hotel.

37
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:25,014
Plus, don't you have to
tell your P.O. if you leave?

38
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,896
Damn, yo, you Fulton
County Police or something?

39
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,350
Yo, hold on, hold on.
Bring it back, man.

40
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,380
What you mean, no hotel?

41
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:31,547
Hey, Earn.

42
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:34,651
You're not allergic to
jicama, are you? By chance?

43
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,420
I don't... No. I don't know. Listen...

44
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:40,290
- Cool.
- It's not a hotel, per se,

45
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,358
but-but I think

46
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,994
it might be better. Huh?

47
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,567
- The fuck I'm looking at, Earn?
- Oh, wait.

48
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:53,436
Th-That's the girl when
both our phones died.

49
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,471
Exactly. And I found her on Instagram.

50
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:57,898
And guess what? She love you.

51
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,475
And she runs the Pajama Jam.

52
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:00,968
Okay, we can just stay

53
00:02:00,993 --> 00:02:03,384
with her and pocket the
money from the hotel.

54
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:06,249
Ooh. She cute as hell, too, boy.

55
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:08,217
You stay trying to be slick.

56
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:09,903
Man, I am slick.

57
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:11,891
Her roommate? Treasurer.

58
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,650
That means Spring Fling next year.

59
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,100
That's, like...

60
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,336
probably more than $60K

61
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:17,393
if I can, you know, sweet-talk her.

62
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,362
All right, man. We'll see.

63
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:20,945
You know, any bad bitch

64
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,890
with over 3K followers,
it could be tough.

65
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:26,135
You know, she got an
unrealistic worldview

66
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:26,969
on how the world works.

67
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:30,440
She only got, like, 300 followers.

68
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:32,375
That's even weirder.

69
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,509
See.

70
00:02:33,843 --> 00:02:35,743
Oh, found my fork.

71
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:37,868
- Yo, I'm ready.
- Hey, hey, hey, man.

72
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:40,675
- Oh, I'm ready, too. All right.
- Yeah.

73
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:43,353
Let's do this, baby.

74
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:46,055
Oh.

75
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:47,664
We're...

76
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,422
we're not gonna have enough room.

77
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:51,707
And we're leaving right now.

78
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:52,897
Nigga, I'm ready right now.

79
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,276
Yeah, man. $200 for security right here.

80
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,300
- Bring all black, boy.
- Say no more.

81
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:58,468
Come on, man, we're leaving.

82
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:00,937

00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,707
Hi. Uh...

117
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,843
does Violet live here?

118
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:21,878
- Hey, guys.
- Oh.

119
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:24,548
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, how's it going?

120
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:26,650
Hi. I'm Violet.

121
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:28,585
'Sup.

122
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,502
Oh!

123
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:30,859
- I see you brought one extra.
- Yeah.

124
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:33,223
That's Tracy. Uh, he won't
be staying here, though.

125
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:35,432
I think he's staying with family.

126
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:37,527
Nah, nah. I'm staying here.

127
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:39,954
- We can find space.
- Oh, word? Cool.

128
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,921
- Great.
- Okay, come in.

129
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:43,245
"Find space."

130
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:46,870
Okay, guys, just make
yourselves at home.

131
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:48,939
Uh, so, you guys remember Erika, right?

132
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,675
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. And, uh, you met Honey.

133
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,110
Mm-hmm.

134
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,466
So, you two can sleep in Erika's room,

135
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:58,245
and Tracy, you can sleep here.

136
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,750
All right, cool.

137
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:01,651
You got cameras around the perimeter?

138
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:03,787
- Uh...
- I'm Paper Boi's security.

139
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,457
He's not really security,
but he'll be fine.

140
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:11,495
Hey, uh, let me show you
where you're sleeping.

141
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:13,663
All right.

142
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,394
Hey, you need a hand, big dog?

143
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,002
- I'm good, bruh.
- You sure?

144
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:25,370
Okay.

145
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:28,370
Nigga, are you eating chocolate chips?

146
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:30,128
Yeah, bruh.

147
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:36,726
Mmm.

148
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,000
You can sleep on the bed with me.

149
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,760
No, no, that's cool.

150
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,375
I can sleep over here.

151
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,186
Don't be stupid.

152
00:06:49,273 --> 00:06:51,173
Come here.

153
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,184
Come on.

154
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:55,920
All right.

155
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:08,387
Yeah.

156
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:11,524
See?

157
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,224
This is nice.

158
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:16,993
Mm-hmm.

159
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:20,004
Can I tell you something?

160
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:25,505
I had a dream about you.

161
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,739
We were holding each other,

162
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:32,909
naked by this river,

163
00:07:33,282 --> 00:07:37,447
and you were this beautiful white crane.

164
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:41,818
And I was this magnificent crocodile.

165
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,689
And we were just laying there.

166
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:48,492
- Hmm.
- Holding each other for warmth.

167
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,396
And then I ate you.

168
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:59,369
There was blood everywhere.

169
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,641
And then this, like, intense light

170
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:07,978
just shot through my belly.

171
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,448
And I knew that meant
that we were connected.

172
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,619
I knew this would happen.

173
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:18,155
Eventually.

174
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:21,173
Mm-hmm.

175
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,241
Hey, what's up, team
Paper Boi? How we living?

176
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,875
Don't be rolling up on
my mans like that, bruh.

177
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,602
- All right, man.
- Hey.

178
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:05,142
We know them. They just performed.

179
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,243
What was that all about?

180
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,578
Oh, my God. I'm such a fan.

181
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,280
- I loved your mixtape.
- You're crushing this shit tonight, man.

182
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,502
- Thanks, man.
- That's good shit.

You want to get, like,

185
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:14,566
Like those pajamas.

186
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:16,005
Yeah, you know.

187
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,422
- Yo, that was a great show.
- Good for a college set.

188
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,458
This kid's killing it. Clark,

189
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,493
Oh, thanks, man. Yo,

190
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,005
I like the outfits, man. Y'all

191
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,840
- No, man, we gonna hang back tonight.
- Come on.

192
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,400
Look, I could use some weed

193
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,469

Carson Flex gonna pull up.

196
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,441

00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,914

- Yeah, I'm-a find you, man.

201
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,015

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,149
Catch you guys later.

203
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,484
Don't have too much fun without me.

204
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,858
Hey.

205
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,658

- Yeah.

206
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:57,422
You need me, just give me the signal.

207
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,163
Hit it from here to there.

208
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,865
- Know what I'm talking about?
- You already know.

209
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,066
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Hey, man.

210
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,402
- Appreciate you.
- For sure, baby.

211
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,583
This nigga really think he a bodyguard.

212
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,521
Yeah.

213
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:11,874
He's just trying to earn his
money. I can understand that.

214
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:14,728
You really showed up.

215
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:18,092
I'm sorry. We have a lot
of artists bail on us,

216
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,951
so thank you so much for coming out.

217
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,019
Oh, no. It's all good. Thank you.

218
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,541
Well, uh, this is my girl, Elise.

219
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:24,255
- Hey. How are you doing?
- Hi.

220
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,801
She's majoring in modern literature,

221
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,346
and she's actually
writing a paper on you.

222
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:30,572
What, like, a Paper Boi paper?

223
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,307
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

224
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,198
- I can feel that.
- That's what I'm talking about.

225
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,000
- You're very aware of your words.
- Oh, yeah?

226
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,398
You're the only rapper
doing that right now.

227
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:38,836
I appreciate that.

228
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,839
Yo. Should we save Alfred?

229
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,208
Nah. No, that's good for him.

230
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,844
I haven't seen him smile in a while.

231
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,889
He needed that.

232
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:52,303
If I'm worried about anybody,
I'm worried about that nigga.

233
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:54,852
Uh-huh.

234
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,121
Oh.

235
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,023
You know that Clark County dude?

236
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,643
- Yeah.
- Industry plant.

237
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:03,471
- Yes, I've been saying that.
- For sure, for sure.

238
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,630
Yeah. No, I mean, it's obvious.

239
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,966
What the fuck?!

240
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:11,969
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

241
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,938
I saw that shit, bro!

242
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,973
No. Okay, just stay.

243
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,709
- Hey, what?
- Hey, chill, all right?

244
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,143
- Yeah, I'm good, man.
- Just, I'm-a check this.

245
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,046
- I'm-a check this out.
- He was looking at

246
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:24,003
- those skimpy-ass whores.
- Who gives a fuck?

247
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:25,815
I wasn't asking you.
What the fuck you think

248
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,411
he's supposed to do?! You
think you're the only one?

249
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,497
Oh, after I bring all
of y'all into my house.

250
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,154
Listen, bitch, keep your
hands off of me for real.

251
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,940
- Why not?
- Do it again, see what the fuck happens.

252
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:34,925
- I'm not scared of you.
- Bitch...

253
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,094
You fucking broke-ass security guard.

254
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,943
Whoa!

00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,614
Yo, you okay?

257
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,918
Oh, damn. Shit.

258
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:02,764
I knew her ass was crazy, man.

259
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,951
I told you, man. What

00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,086

267
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,638
Hey, Paper Boi. What's up,

268
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:18,202

00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,148
Dude, you can't do

00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,150

280
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,256

00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,258
Relax. It's cool. Okay, listen.

I'm looking like a goddamn peasant, man.

299
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,248
All I know is that girl Violet

00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:55,550
That's all I know.

301

00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:27,740
Violet knows everybody.

308
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:29,318
Look, all I know is I

309
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:30,909

00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:32,646
Wait a minute. Y'all smell that?

Yeah.

314
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:43,979
Citronella. This way.

315
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:46,688
Fuck, man.

316
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,808
Holy shit. You're fucking Paper Boi.

317
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:05,090
- Yeah.
- That explains the citronella.

318
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:08,598
What are you doing here,
man? Are those silk pajamas?

319
00:15:08,623 --> 00:15:11,550
Yeah, man, I was... I was
performing at Pajama Jam.

320
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,685
The what?

321
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:15,467

00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,293
Yeah, yeah, fuck yeah, we got weed.

Hell yeah, man. Y'all on them Backwoods?

00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:25,371
We got some other shit in the
house, too. We'll smoke you out.

326
00:15:25,396 --> 00:15:27,410
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

327
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,735
Hell yeah.

328
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:32,704
Oh, what the fuck was that?

329
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,840
It's all good. It's just
some pledges, you know?

330
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,443
Newbies got to pay the price, right?

331
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,678
Hey, uh, here, come on.

332
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,675
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Yeah.

333
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,659
Hey. Paper Boi's here. Come on.

334
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:08,723
Man, this shit is bugged
the fuck out, bruh.

335
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,475
Man. But I like what
y'all doing here, bruh.

336
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,934
You don't give no fucks.

337
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,565
Hey, yo, I just... I
got to tell you, man.

338
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,273
You're like... one-one of
my two favorite rappers.

339
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:24,019
You know, you and Post Malone?

340
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,960
Yo, that Postal mixtape...
That changed my shit up, man.

341
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:31,563
Hey, man, is that... is
that an elephant rifle?

342
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:34,445
Uh... yeah.

343
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,970
Yeah, a bunch of the alumni
send guns to the frats.

344
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,689
A lot of them are in the NRA.

345
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,099
Oh, okay.

346
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,907
I was... word. I was thinking

- A gun room?
- Yeah. Want to see?

350
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:53,131
Wait.

00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:56,202

00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:57,426
Oh, shit.

353
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,958
Hell yeah. Y-You want
to see the gun room?

354
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:01,863

00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,050

Yes.

00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:11,616
Tracy's got to go, man.

403
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:20,434
Oh, shit, nigga, I'm
talking about your ass.

404
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:27,666
What? What are you talking about?

405
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:28,934
- How am I the problem?
- Man, you gonna

406
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:32,137
act like tonight wasn't a
bunch of your bad decisions?

407
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:35,607
Did you not see Tracy throw a girl down

408
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,042
- a flight of steps?
- I saw it.

409
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:38,910
And it happened after
she threw a cup at me

410
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,679
for talking to another broad, man.

411
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:41,913
And speaking of which, that bitch...

412
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,449
Man, that bitch was
crazy from the start, man.

413
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:45,550
And you knew that.

414
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:47,294
And you still put me in
the same room with her ass

415
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,031
so you could save the same
amount of money I would

416
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:50,469
have made in an hour
or less off the block.

417
00:20:50,494 --> 00:20:53,031
Tracy escalated a harmless situation.

418
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:55,026
- Bro.
- You saw that, bruh.

419
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:57,763
Nothing was about to happen
until something happened.

420
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,365
I've been talking to Clark
County's manager, man.

421
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:04,247
About what?

422
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:05,880
The fuck you think, Earn?

423
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,608
Managing me. Actually managing me, man.

424
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,776
Shit I could be getting,

425
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,029
shit I should be getting out here.

426
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,887
Look, you family, man, and
I'm trying to ride with you,

427
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:24,323
but sometimes that
shit ain't enough, bro.

428
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:27,198
'Cause money is important.

429
00:21:28,994 --> 00:21:31,273
I see exactly what's happening out here.

430
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:35,531
It's getting colder, it's
getting harder to eat.

431
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:38,899
I need shit, Lottie
needs shit. You need shit.

432
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,484
I gotta make my next moves

433
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,717
my best moves, man, so...

434
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,280
Something gotta shake.

435
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,494
I don't think you're cut out for it.

436
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:25,918
- Oh... shit, boy.
- The fuck.

437
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,423
Fuck, no, man.

438
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,872
What the fuck is all this shit?

439
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:32,529
- That's fucked up, bruh.
- Fuck, bro.

440
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:35,621
That's fucked up, bruh. For real.

441
00:23:35,657 --> 00:23:37,741
No, goddamn it. God, man!

442
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:38,964
Al, just chill.

443
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:41,164
Damn it, man.

444
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,532
My car and shit, man.

445
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:47,733
Fucking college bitches.

446
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:49,535
Who the fuck are we dealing with, man?

447
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:52,014
Look at all our shit on
the fucking lawn, man!

448
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:55,522
- Oh, God, bro.
- What the fuck?

449
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Oh, fuck no, man!

450
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:01,597
Look at this shit.
They cut up all my shit!

451
00:24:01,622 --> 00:24:02,921
Goddamn!

452
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:05,715
And of course my fucking weed gone.

453
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,503
Oh.

454
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,457
- Goddamn, let me see that, bruh.
- Oh, shit.

455
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,526
Not the kicks, bruh.

456
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:15,820
Damn, I couldn't even be mad at that.

457
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,853
That's kind of... It's impressive.

458
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:19,968
Huh.

459
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:22,235
Oh, shit.

460
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:30,876
Oh, my God, these fucking hos, man.

461
00:24:30,912 --> 00:24:33,645
Fucking hate these
fucking college hos. Shit!

462
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,256
Where's my laptop?

463
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:37,536
Violet.

464
00:24:39,316 --> 00:24:40,649
Violet!

465
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:42,655
Ah, shit. This nigga losing it, man.

466
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:45,358
- Violet, open this fucking door!
- Hey, Earn.

467
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:47,158
Violet! Violet!

468
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:48,694
- Open this door.
- Earn, it's not really that serious.

469
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,396
Don't fucking touch me, man.

470
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:52,298
Yo! Violet!

471
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,586
That's your cousin, bro.

472
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:56,702
Earn, look, man. Ain't
nobody in there, bro.

473
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:58,571
Nobody's there; they gone.

474
00:24:59,313 --> 00:25:01,116
- Nah, somebody's in there.
- Look, we'll just go back home.

475
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:02,475
They're gonna open this fucking door.

476
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,343
We'll just figure this out.

477
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,511
- What is you doing, man?
- Oh!

478
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,313
Yo, Earn. Earn, man.

- Let's go, man. Earn!

482
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:14,954
- Man, you don't hear that shit?
- It's cool.

483
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:17,490
- Man, don't do this to me, nigga.
- I'm on probation!

484
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:18,758
Open this fucking door!

485
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:20,526
I'm leaving with or

486
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,328
- Come on, man.
- Get your ass home.

487
00:25:22,363 --> 00:25:23,596
Earn. Come on, man.

488
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:25,331
Fuck that nigga. I'm out, man.

489
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,081
That shit was crazy, huh?

490
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:48,754
Earn?

491
00:25:49,377 --> 00:25:52,955
Bruh, you pulling

492
00:25:53,104 --> 00:25:54,899
Now, that shit was fucked up, my nigga.

493
00:25:54,924 --> 00:25:58,397
- You ain't have to do 'em like that, man.
- For real.

494
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,087
Yo, this nigga was kicking the...

495
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:01,434

497
00:26:04,315 --> 00:26:05,548
Oh, fuck, man.

498
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:07,454
What made you go like
that, bro? Kickin' the door?

499
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:08,758
What, you think a woman
gonna open the door

500
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:09,775
for you, kickin' the
door like that, bro?

501
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:11,827
Tracy, could you do me
a favor and stop talking?

502
00:26:11,852 --> 00:26:13,452
I'm not in the mood.

503
00:26:18,553 --> 00:26:20,525
"I'm not in the mood."

504
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:25,422
Yo, man. Your little
cuz got a temper, man.

505
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:27,193
You need to watch out for that one.

506
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,179
You got to watch out for me?

507
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:35,257
Nigga, this is your fault.

508
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:37,943
Yeah. It was me that
made them girls crazy.

509
00:26:37,968 --> 00:26:39,438
Nigga, it was. Were you there?

510
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,643
Hey, both of y'all, chill.

511
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,357
Did you steal that?

512
00:26:58,393 --> 00:27:00,559
Goddamn!

513
00:27:00,805 --> 00:27:04,430
Yo, is you the campus police?

514
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:06,232
Let me see your badge.

515
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:09,235
Let me see it.

516
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:15,479
Bang!

517
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:22,417
Nigga, it's old as fuck, bruh.

518
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:23,979
You can't even put a
bullet in this thing.

519
00:27:24,004 --> 00:27:26,385
Look at his face, man.
He's scared as hell, boy.

520
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,930
Yo, pull this car over,
so I can fight this nigga.

521
