1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,251
Okay.

2
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:06,376
Ooh-wee, I am fuming, y'all.

3
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:10,325
So I was taking my ten-year-old,
Destiny, to school this morning.

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:15,496
Now, she loves that 96.5 radio station.

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:19,200
It's like the hits or
top 40 hits or something.

6
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:20,862
This rap song comes on.

7
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,339
And it was just... disgusting.

8
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:26,574
It's... you okay, baby?

9
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:30,211
Want a juice box?

10
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:34,141
So, uh, I-I looked up the lyrics.

11
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:37,992
And the song is by this guy, Paper Boi,

12
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,292
and I'm gonna read
y'all what was playing.

13
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:43,090
So there's gonna be some cussing.

14
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:44,324
But it's not my words.

15
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:46,677
Okay, so here it goes.

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,198
"Bitch, I need reparations."

17
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:55,126
N-Niggas tired of dancing
like The Temptations.

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,751
Sell a dime bag or that
new crack, fentanyl.

19
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:01,626
The same reason Prince killed.

20
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:04,502
My dick is like a tree trunk.

21
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:07,293
Baby, catch this tree sap.

22
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:09,751
Kicked you out the condo.

23
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:12,126
This ain't the place you sleep at.

24
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:14,674
Baby, slide on the dick.

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,001
You can do it all night.

26
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:19,623
You can be my baby mama.

27
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,251
"You can't ever be my wife."

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,033
Here's where it gets crazy, y'all.

29
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:30,694
"Said no to college 'cause it's no fun."

30
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,637
Mo' drugs and mo' guns.

31
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:36,792
But I still might have to slap a trick.

32
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:40,563
"Shout-out Colin Kaepernick."

33
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:44,335
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:48,188
It's just, like, this is what was on.

35
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,125
♪ Uh, told a bitch you
motherfuckin' right ♪

Yo, that white woman crying,

00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,794
that was the best thing that
could've happened to us, man.

41
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:09,286
Their tears are powerful.

42
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:10,786
They are. They really are.

43
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:11,887
Yo, I was gonna send her ass a gift,

00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:47,011
Yeah, man.

60
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,718
Man, see, listen, I was trying to see

61
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,751

- Man, fuck you, dude!

65
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,416
I'm talking to Paper Boi.

66
00:02:58,617 --> 00:03:00,452
Okey-dokey.

00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:16,799
Yes, sir, it'll be right up.

74
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:24,420
Okay, that was... weird.

Man, that shit be happening

81
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,690
I would love to be the person
who can stunt on somebody.

82
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,085
You can stunt on anybody you want.

Man, all you need is some money.

I don't even think it's that.

86
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:47,399
I once bought a homeless
person a McDonald's meal.

87
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:48,600
He threw it away right in front of me.

hey, what happened?
Hey, what's going on?

189
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:35,749
Hey, sorry, man.

190
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:37,558
The program just crashed or something.

191
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,560
The program just crashed?

192
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:42,154
I just got to up... we
got to update, probably.

193
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:43,535
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, man.

194
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,093
It just... yeah, it just crashed.

195
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:48,879
Dude, don't crash it again, dude.

196
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:49,931
Yeah, that's my bad.

197
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:51,756
- Yeah, it's your bad.
- It just crashed, so...

198
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:53,681
Dude, if it crashes again,

199
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,982
I'm gonna crash my foot in your ass.

200
00:07:57,396 --> 00:07:59,006
Fix that shit, okay?

201
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:00,985
Yeah, that's-that's my bad. You know...

202
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,395
Hey, yo, Al, man. You
fucks with that, man?

203
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,879
- Dude, that was...
- That shit was dope to me, man.

204
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:06,692
Boy, you're a strapping young lad.

205
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,968
- It's good, man.
- Hey, man.

206
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:08,924
I appreciate you, Darius.

207
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:10,801
- You got that, man.
- Yo, it's the gift, bro.

208
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:13,395
Like, I was just freestyling
off the top, right?

209
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,718
And then I just got into
this different world, man.

210
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,801
I don't even remember what
I said, to be real, man.

211
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:19,008
I felt that, man.

212
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,962
Hopefully, I can recreate it, you know,

213
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:24,638
um, after I listen to it
because the engineer did his job.

214
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:26,263
He recorded it, right?

215
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:27,610
Yeah, we got that. I'm
just double-checking

216
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,599
- that it's there, you know?
- Right, right.

217
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:30,271
- What's up?
- Yo.

218
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,676
- You need to stop playing, dawg. Okay?
- Man, I'm not...

219
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:36,191
- I'm not playing. It's...
- Hey, yo, Boogz, it's cool, man.

220
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,754
'Cause it's all love, right?
Hey, man, I love you, bro.

221
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,099
I wouldn't hurt you. I'd
never put a hand on you.

222
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:42,857
I know that.

223
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:44,082
Just don't fuck up

224
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:47,254
because I'm not the only
one with hands in this world.

225
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,850
You know what I'm saying?

226
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:51,107
Yeah, man. I love you, too.

227
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:54,061
- Let's do this.
- Yeah, hey, stop talking.

228
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,309
Damn, this place is kind of nice.

229
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:00,533
Yeah, and it serves alcohol.

230
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:02,103
'Cause, you know, when you're drunk,

231
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:05,433
the one thing you want to do
is sit in a chair for two hours.

232
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,951
- Yeah, totally.
- Yeah.

233
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:09,436
- May I help you?
- Yeah, uh, can I get, uh,

234
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,218
two tickets for Fast & Furious?

235
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,632
Oh, regular or VIP?

236
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:16,183
- What does VIP get you?
- It doesn't matter. Two VIPs.

237
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:18,605
- Okay.
- Yeah.

238
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:23,423
I'm sorry,

239
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:25,960
but I can't take a bill that large.

240
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,393
It's all right, um... just use my debit.

241
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:32,900
Mm-hmm. Uh, can I see an
ID or a driver's license?

242
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:34,168
Thank you.

243
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,411
Okay. I got to make a copy of
these every time we swipe it,

244
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,402
so, um, are you good on tickets?

245
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:42,795
You got to make a copy
every time you swipe?

246
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,976
Yeah, I know it's crazy.
It's a new policy, though.

247
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,100
Yeah, but...

248
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,605
Yeah, I don't want a bunch
of copies of my debit card

249
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,454
and my driver's license
all around, you know?

250
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:53,043
What if somebody steals it?

251
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:55,505
- We're not responsible for that.
- You know what?

252
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,279
It's fine 'cause I have cash.
I could just pay with it.

253
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,995
No, it's fine. Um, it's okay, we'll...

254
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:04,008
We'll figure something else
out. It's fine. Thank you.

255
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:05,232
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

256
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:08,179
Babe, it's fine. I can pay.

257
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:11,205
No, it... This place
feels weird to you, right?

258
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,598
- It feels kind of strange.
- Yeah. It's a weird policy.

259
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:15,076
Yeah, yeah. And when did
they even start doing that?

260
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:17,311
$32.28.

261
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,518

I-I know you don't know me,

265
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:29,515
but I just tried to pay with
a hundred, and they told...

00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:35,482
Wow. Okay, let's-let's
get out of here. Yeah.

342
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:50,429
No, it's just, it's fucking amaz...

343
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,320
It crashed again.

344
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:02,434
Hey, yo, Boogz, I'm gonna
go for a walk real quick,

345
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:03,954
all right, man?

346
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:19,284
Y'all should go home.

347
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:28,093
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, man.

348
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:30,362
I was on my way out anyway,
you know what I mean.

349
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,146
- Good luck with your track, bro.
- Thanks, man.

350
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:37,369
- Appreciate it. Yep.
- Stay woke.

351
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:40,138
I'm gonna just take this, man,
'cause it's, like, half full.

352
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,439
- Oh, yeah, I-I got it, man.
- Yep, you got this.

353
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,937
We got it, we got it.

354
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:49,114
If you break it down, hookah
kind of sounds like something

355
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:51,249
the tobacco industry
created for six-year-olds.

356
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:54,152
You know what I'm saying?
Like... fruit-flavored smoke.

357
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:57,289
You're not supposed to
breathe it in, you know that?

358
00:14:57,391 --> 00:14:58,390
- You're not supposed to inhale?
- Thank you.

359
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:02,360
- No, Grandpa.
- Now I really hate it.

360
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:05,063
I got to pat you down, bro.

361
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:07,347
Sure, yeah. All right.

362
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:14,621
You're good, you're good, bro.

363
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:17,209
$20 for dudes, bro.

364
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:19,894
All right. $20?

365
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,552
$20 for dudes, bro.

366
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:25,481
There, you have a good night, man.

367
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:27,539
- Thanks.
- Picture ID.

368
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:31,189
See?

369
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,661
You're not gonna tell me it's not cute.

370
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:36,328
I thought I'd see more
Middle Eastern people here.

371
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:37,790
It's kind of weird.

372
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:39,615
Thank you.

373
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,833
Okay, so, which flavor do you like?

374
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,684
'Cause mint is good,
but you can mix them.

375
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:46,184
I'm not really a mint guy.

376
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:48,346
- I don't like how it feels in my mouth.
- Oh, my God.

377
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:49,408
Especially with smoke...

378
00:15:49,469 --> 00:15:51,253
You have the palate
of a three-year-old.

379
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:53,045
Untrue. I...

380
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,148
Sir, did you just pay with
that $100 bill outside?

381
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:59,721
Uh... yeah?

382
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:02,087
Well, that $100 bill was fake.

383
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:05,104
- You need to come with us.
- What? What do you mean?

384
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:08,536
That bill you used was fake. Let's go.

385
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,228
Are you sure it was mine?

386
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:12,860
You're the only one who's
paid with a $100 bill.

387
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:15,408
- Let's just go.
- All right.

388
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:17,906
You see? Right there.

389
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:19,204
There's the watermark.

390
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:24,241
No, no. You did that.

391
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:25,951
I did that?

392
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:27,178
What do you...?

393
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:30,148
No, man... just-just get
another hundred to compare it.

394
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,718
There are no other hundreds in the bar.

395
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:34,210
Do you got one of those...

396
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,601
one of those pens that
you can mark it with?

397
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:38,017
Of course not.

398
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:40,788
How do you even know it's fake?

399
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,145
I know, okay?

400
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:44,589
Here. Try and rip it up.

401
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:46,128
What?

402
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:47,934
What are you talking
about? That makes no sense.

403
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:49,911
I'm not falling for your tricks.

404
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,372
You know what?

405
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,817
It's fine. Just... Just give me the...

406
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,100
Give me the money back. I-I'll leave.

407
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:01,191
Yeah, but you already came inside.

408
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:03,257
You still need to pay.

409
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:06,857
Hurry up!

410
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,768
Oh, my fucking God.

411
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:18,685
Hey.

412
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,772
We all know that the bill was real,

413
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:23,735
but the owner was tripping.

414
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:25,884
Sorry about that.

415
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:32,778
That was definitely racist.

416
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,184
Yeah, what the fuck?
This is supposed to be

417
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:36,068
a celebration, man.

418
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:38,104
Yeah, I know.

419
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:39,870
Let's just get some food.

420
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:40,860
No, no, no.

421
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:42,278
I know where we're going.

422
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:44,073
Where we gonna go?

423
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:46,201
I'm going somewhere where
people definitely know

424
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:48,426
how to treat someone with money.

425
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,351
Yeah. A'ight, a'ight.

426
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,837

00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:55,439

Okay.

Okay, honey, that'll be $20.

- That wasn't even three seconds.

531

You-you didn't even make it over there.

532
00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:42,383

But it comes with the table.

536
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:50,897
Yeah, it comes with the
table, so you have to buy one.

537
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:52,990
How much?

538
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:54,667

- Here.
- Okay.

541
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:01,708
I'll be back with the drinks.

542
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,543
You got any ones?

543
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,845
I want to give it to the girl on stage.

544
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,648
But she's so skinny, and she...

545
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,187
- she's not doing anything.
- I know.

546
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:13,226
But I feel bad for her.

547
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:14,621
She seems new, and, like,

548
00:22:14,723 --> 00:22:15,822
all the other girls are so pretty,

549
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:17,790
and she shouldn't have to compete.

550
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,124
All right.

551
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:21,449
You got it. Pity dance.

552
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,546
I've never heard of that.

553
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,134
"She looks new."

554
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:29,025
Man, that's Minnie.

555
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,322
Looking new her hook.

556
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:33,335
Yeah, she's been looking new for
about damn ten years now, man.

557
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:35,975
- Real talk?
- Mm-hmm.

558
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:42,143
Yeah, well... it's working for her.

559
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:43,187
Hmm.

560
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:44,628
Hey, man.

561
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:46,552
Van told me about that $100 bill shit.

562
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:48,559
Yeah, that shit was wack.

563
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:51,332
Yeah, well, you can't be going
out spending $100 bills, nigga.

564
00:22:51,357 --> 00:22:52,289
Why not?

565
00:22:52,314 --> 00:22:54,594
It's legal U.S. tender.

566
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:55,728
Look at you, man.

567
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,328
You don't look like no damn dope boy.

568
00:22:57,353 --> 00:22:58,731
I'd think that shit was fake, too.

569
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,726
You told me the only thing I needed

570
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:03,217
- to run this city was money.
- Mm-mm.

571
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:05,477
Money is an idea, man.

572
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,032
Look, there's a reason that a
white dude dressed just like you

573
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:09,653
can walk into a bank and get a loan,

574
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:12,311
and you can't even
spend a $100 bill, man.

575
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:14,302
I mean, you need to start
acting like you're better

576
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,101
than other niggas, and then
they'll start treating you

577
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:17,768
- better than other niggas.
- Yeah, 'cause otherwise,

578
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:20,039
- you're just another nigga.
- Another nigga.

579
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,313
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

580
00:23:21,863 --> 00:23:23,180
Hey, look at Tracy ass over there, man.

581
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:25,563
He's been telling these hos
all night that he's my manager.

582
00:23:25,588 --> 00:23:27,383
Yo, man. We should hire her, yo.

583
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,892
- Yeah? Hey!
- There it is!

584
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:32,632
I don't even know why I'm here.

585
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:34,744
This place has been
finessing me all night.

586
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:35,861
Duh, nigga.

587
00:23:35,886 --> 00:23:37,570
It's a strip club. That's what it's for.

588
00:23:37,672 --> 00:23:39,189
Yep. It ain't like you're supposed to be

589
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:40,768
out here saving money.

590
00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:42,621
Yeah, ain't saving no money

591
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:44,413
- at no strip club.
- Yeah.

592
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:46,888
Nigga.

593
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,559
You okay?

594
00:24:02,052 --> 00:24:03,952
Nah, I had fun.

595
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:17,033
What's going on?

596
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:18,851
Yeah, Michael Vick
out here racing people.

597
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,142
He taking bets, too.

598
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:21,667
Yeah, boy, yeah.

599
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:23,995
Is he... is he doing okay?

600
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:25,101
Oh, he fine.

601
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:26,858
It's just a good hustle.

602
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:29,309
Yeah. Drunk people
just want to race him.

603
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:30,906
This his sixth race

604
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:33,031
in the ten minutes
I've been standing here.

605
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:35,530
- That boy's good.
- Anybody else?

606
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:36,835
Anybody?

607
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:38,662
Three-to-one odds.

608
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:40,171
It's fair.

609
00:24:41,385 --> 00:24:44,008
I kind of want to see this.

610
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:45,111
I'll do it.

611
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:49,556
No, what, wait... what are you doing?

612
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:51,850
Sometimes you just
got to stunt on people.

613
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:54,119
And also, I haven't run
six races in ten minutes.

614
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:55,615
Should be good.

615
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,932
Let's make this quick.

616
00:24:58,024 --> 00:24:59,991
Oh, shit.

617
00:25:04,434 --> 00:25:05,935
All right, all right, all
right, fellas, fellas, fellas.

618
00:25:06,032 --> 00:25:07,098
You know how we do it.

619
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,742
Let's get it going, let's get it going.

620
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,801
A'ight? On your mark.

621
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:12,837
Get set.

622
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:14,335
Go!

623
00:25:28,683 --> 00:25:30,225
It's Michael Vick.
