Hey, man!

talking to you, man,

13
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,926
I'm speaking English.
- All right, cool.

- Worldstar!

17
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,612
- No, don't do that to us.
- No, no, no, no no.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,740
I think I'm being
more than fair,

compensation.

20
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,939
So let's go, bro.

21
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,606
- No, y'all staying
broke tonight.

22
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,375
- Well, you trying to get
in the club before 10:45,

23
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,084
which means you trying
to get in before 11:00,

24
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:50,276
which means you also broke.

25
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:51,618
Nobody's stunting

26
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,422
- Ain't no one stunting
on anyone here.

27
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:54,594
- Bitch, will you please
shut the hell up?

28
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:55,892
- Don't talk to me like that!

29
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,293
- I'll talk to whoever
however I want,

30
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,855
if you got a problem with it,
we can settle it,

31
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,732
but my car was not
involved, man.

32
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,731
- Hold on, hold on, man, I'm
getting crazy deja vu right now.

33
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:07,004
Okay, where's the dog
with the Texas on him?

34
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,766
Oh, there he is.

35
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,113
That's a trip, man.

36
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:14,314
- Yo, what's your man on?

37
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:16,412
- Yo, worry about
this mirror, man.

38
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:17,784
- Just get another mirror.
You Paper Boy.

39
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,421
You rich, right?
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

You Paper Boy?
- You know it.

41
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:27,224

garbage,
that postal mixtape was garbage.

42
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,755
What it was?
Uh, "Mucking."

43
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,560
Mucking--what the hell
is mucking, Paper Boy?

44
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,632
- Man, you know what it is, I
explained in the hood, nigger.

45
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,001
Why we even talking, man?
Why--

46
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,598
Shit, what's going on?
What's good?

47
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,070

Stop it.

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,470
Nigga, what are you doing?

50
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,802
- Nigga, what are you doing?

51
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,336
- Okay, well, what's up?
Hmm? Yeah.

52

- I had a weird dream.

84
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,216
I was swimming in this pool,
but it was like the ocean

85
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,852
and I was swimming with the
seaweed, but it wasn't seaweed,

86
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,557
it was, like, hands.

87
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,561
And I was swimming
with this girl.

88
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,233

if the hands grab you,

00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:18,173
they pull you down and drown
you, so swim above them.

Of course I did.

132
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,448
[mouthing] I did not.

parent teacher conferences.

Also, I don't always want
her at your parents' house.
