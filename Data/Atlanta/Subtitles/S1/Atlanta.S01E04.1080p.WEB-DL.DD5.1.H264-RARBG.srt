Not in September,
but today.

416
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,014
Okay?
See, I'm poor, Darius.

417
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,882
Okay?
And poor people

418
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,718
don't have time
for investments

419
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,553
because poor people
are too busy

420
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,288

okay?

423
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,561
Right, I asked you
at the pawn shop,

424
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,896
if you needed the money,
to take the money.

425
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,265
And you said you
wanted more money,

426
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,901
so I got you more money.

427
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,421

-No, it's cool, man--
-no, no, it's fine.

430
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,662
I'm just stressed.
I got a lot going on.

431
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,929
No, it's fine.
It's fine.

432
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,264
I get a new one every month.

433
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,066

tracking me.
