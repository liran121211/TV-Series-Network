All new Thursdays

ANNOUNCER:
FX presents
Atlanta.

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,689
Next customer.

6
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:26,193
Um, can I get a kid's meal?

7
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,227
Huh?
What was that, sir?

8
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,532
Can I get a kid's meal?

9
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,034
Speak up. There's
a lot going on here, honey.

10
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,997
Can I get a kid's meal?

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,566
I don't see no kids.

12
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:40,867
Yeah, I don't have
a kid with me.

13
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,408
I'm gonna eat it.

14
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,713
Well, only a kid can order
a kid's meal.

15
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,905
That's not true.
I know that's not true.

16
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,777
Oh, yeah, it is.
Only a kid can order it.

17
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:53,217
So a kid has to wait in line
and order a kid's meal.

18
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:55,394
A kid can't get
an adult meal?

19
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:56,793
Look here, sir,
you have to be

20
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,134
14 or younger
to get a kid's meal.

21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,959
I've just been made
day manager,

22
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,303
and I didn't get that title
by handing out discounted meals.

23
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,470
Look, you don't have to be a kid
to get a kid's meal, okay?

24
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,528
Do you have to be a Evander
Holyfield to get the champ?

25
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,467
Okay, do you have to be
fucking Chubby Checker

26
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,742
to get the Chubby Decker?

27
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,740
Do you need to have
a long foot to--

28
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,042
that one doesn't translate,
but you know--

29
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,584
This is ridiculous, okay?

30
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,749
Can I just please get
a kid's meal?

31
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,452
Can I get a cup for water?

32
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,394
Sure.
Here you are.

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,620
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

34
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:29,686
Next.

a commission, though, right?

You might as well sell drugs.

Yeah.

How do you make money?

50
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,127
I sell drugs.
It's lucrative.

51
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,628
Yeah, man, it's easy.
People are addicted to them.

52
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,701
Mm-hmm.
Sell it till you get rich.

53
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,801
How else you pay
for studio time,

54
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,173
clothes, videos, and weed
without a lame-ass job?

55
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,743
Yeah, but, you know,
you're more famous now.

56
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,912
Your profile's risen,
which means more risk, you know?

57
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,311
You can't go to jail, man.

58
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,643
We'll be careful
out there, man.

59
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,077
Out where?

60
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,381

Got to see the Mexicans.

61
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,884

Hi.

76
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,124
No, don't get up.

77
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,855
I wouldn't want you
to have to pick up Lottie

78

and ruin all that
you're doing.

79

I just got here.

I thought you were gonna
pick her up today, right?

81

Honey,
is it really that hard

82
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:52,128
to help me out
every once in a while?

83
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,225
I even have to take her
to your parents' place myself.

84
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,598
Really, Earn?

85
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,136
Is this about having to
bail me out?

Please, you really think
you're the first boy

87
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,636
I've bailed out of jail?

88
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,444
Yeah.

Nigga, don't.

93
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:12,086
Don't what?
Be happy?

94
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,889
I never ride you for you doing
what you want to do

95
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,561
with your life.

96
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,659
No, you roll your eyes at me
and you call me crazy

97
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,432
any time I try
to tell you something.

I'm crazy-ass Vanessa.

Whatever.

100
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,509
I've been inconsiderate.

101

I get it.
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,785
What are you doing tomorrow?
I want to take you to dinner.

103

-No, it's too late.
-It's too late?

104
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,630
Yeah, you messed up.

105
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,874
Can I buy you dinner
and watch you eat it

106
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,773
from across the room?

107
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,505
You know, I can get
one of those corny niggas

108
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,810
to eat it with you.
I know you love them.

"Oh, I love your energy.

any music from the '90s?

-It's all amazing."

Mm-hmm.
Talking about you.

114
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:27,803
Why are you always turning me
into the angry black woman?

115
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,898
-'Cause you are.
-Are you kidding me?

116
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,070
-I'm the stereotype?
-Mm-hmm.

117
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,699
While your ass,
you can't even take care

118
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,144
of your own goddamn kid?

119
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,668
I'm fine with being
a stereotype.

120
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,414
-It's working out great for me.
-Really?

121
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,409
Yeah, obviously I'm in a bed
and I'm technically homeless.

122
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,683
It's pretty great.

How are you broke on payday?

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,860
What are you,
"12 Years a Slave"?

131
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,629
Yeah, my name is
"12 Years a Slave."

132
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,759
-The slave.
-Shut up, nigga.

133
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,093
You don't know his name.

134
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,727
I gotta take Van out
on this date.

135
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,573
And then the math of the money
I need for the week,

136
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,128
including this MARTA card,
I only have $62 left over.

137
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:44,067
Yo, yo, yo, $62 is plenty enough
to go on a date, man.

138
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,114
Well, you--hey, you know what?

139
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,509
Take her out
to the Indigo Lounge.

140
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,036
What's that?

141
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,977
It's a little spot
in mid-town I go to.

142
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,752
Taking a couple of my hos.
(chuckles)

143
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:56,881
You know, the ones I really
like, like Eve and Jessica.

144
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,947
Yeah, dog.
It is nice in there.

145
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,746
And, you know the best part
about it?

146
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:04,158
They got the happy hour menu
popping all night after 7:00.

147
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,061
-Word?
-Yeah.

148
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,803
It's nice in there, man.
You'll like it, dog.

149
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,228
Drinks be like five bucks.

150
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,762
Should go check it out, bro.

151
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,628
A'ight. Bet.
I'll talk to you later.

152
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,597
Yes, sir.
Hand dog out.

153
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:23,776
Yo, I know you was not just
listening to my conversation.

154
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,005
Girl, you are some mess.

155
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,399
Shit,
I might just win tonight.

156
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,876
MAN: Hey, man.
It's gonna be quick, a'ight?

157
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,808
Don't let Earn spook you
and shit.

158
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,654
-Spook me?
-Mm-hmm.

159
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,309
Man, I ain't scared of nothing.
I got Daddy right here.

160
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,948
(hip-hop playing)

161
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,324
-You call your gun "Daddy"?
-Yes.

162
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,161
That's weird, man.

163
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,564
Is it weird when your girl
call you "Daddy"?

164
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,833
Man, that's completely
different, and yes, yes.

165
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,862
It is.

166
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,327
All right,
what about Papi?

167
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,965
I know you ain't got no problem
with Papi.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,570
Man, Papi, that's like...

169
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,496
Cultural.

170
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,408
Oh.
Oh, okay.

171
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,509
Because it's Spanish,
now all the sudden, it's sexy.

172
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,812
Look,
that shit always creepy.

173
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,083

about this,

on one thing, one thing.

ring up my order

351

I'm spending?

352
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,947
