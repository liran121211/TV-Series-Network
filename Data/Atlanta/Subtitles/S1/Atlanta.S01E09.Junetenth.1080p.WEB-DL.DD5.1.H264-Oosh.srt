367
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,695
Let's go back inside.

368
00:17:37,697 --> 00:17:41,199
Make sure our husbands
are behaving.

369
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:44,569
(beatboxing)

370
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:46,237
Jim Crow!

371
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,240
Has the name of a man, but...

372
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,509
is a ghost.

373
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:53,078
I am a man.

374
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,513
But Jim Crow

375
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:58,283
is haunting me,

376
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,586
like in that movie
"Poltergeist."

377
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:04,222
And I am stuck

378
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,891
in a television,

379
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,360
like that little girl.

380
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:11,763
Just get me out of here--

381
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:13,565
I don't want to be

382
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:16,367
in an electrical

383
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,303
appliance.

384
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,304
(scatting)

385
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,738
<i> (hollow echoing)</i>

386
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,141
Oh, but my point is moot.

387
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,410
I have seen strange fruit

388
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:27,912
loaded in this garden
of Eden...

389
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:30,648
<i> (whirring drowning out voices)</i>

390
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,950
-(slamming)
-Shit.

391
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:33,384
-Oh, yes. They are here.
-Sorry.

392
00:18:33,386 --> 00:18:34,986
-It's okay.
-Sorry about that, man.

393
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,922
-Feeding and feeding...
-Is that Red Bull and vodka?

394
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:40,558
Well, yeah, but, uh, look,
don't tell my wife.

395
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,893
I'm not supposed to have
too much caffeine.

396
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:45,597
-Where did you get that?
-Bar.

397
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,932
-I am a man, but...
-Bar.

398
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,902
-Jim Crow is haunting me.
-Excuse me.

399
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:52,570
Excuse me.

400
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:54,005
Hey, you're Paper Boi's
dude, ain't you?

401
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,841
-Can we get a picture?
-Uh...of--of me?

402
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:59,644
I guess. You here.
He here?

403
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:03,114
No, he's not--actually,
right now's not a good time.

404
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,682
-(snorts)
-Hey.

405
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:06,417
Well, can you pass Paper Boi
a message for me?

406
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:07,852
Yeah, tell him
my sister likes him?

407
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:09,254
-Okay.
-All right.

408
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:10,488
-Here's a pair of her underwear.
-Whoa.

409
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,923
-Give it to Paper Boi.
-Why? No.

410
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:13,758
-Her name Tangela.
-Why are you--no.

411
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,293
Why do you have
your sister's underwear?

412
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,996
-(snorts) Never know, man.
-Never know what?

413
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:20,665
No. Out. Out.
No, no. Go.

414
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,133
If you want more food,

415
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:24,369
Ramon will bring you
a to-go plate outside.

416
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,670
-Earn.
-Okay, good-bye.

417
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:27,138
Hey, man.
What'd you think?

418
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,274
I would love any
honest criticism.

419
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:30,975
-Uh-uh. No, no.
-Is everything okay?

420
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:32,610
Yeah, we straight,
we were just

421
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:34,479
saying "What's up"
to Paper Boi's boy.

422
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:37,515
-(laughing)
-Paper Boi?

423
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:40,118
(laughter)

424
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,119
Oh, my...

425
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:44,722
They must be confusing you.

426
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:46,658
-That's funny.
-Paper Boi.

427
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,127
-Confused with someone else.
-Someone else.

428
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,362
Paper Boi!
I knew it!

429
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:52,897
I knew
I knew you from somewhere.

430
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,233
I had such a special feeling
about you, Earn.

431
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:59,470
Honey--honey,
Earn is Paper Boi's manager.

432
00:19:59,472 --> 00:20:01,206
Oh, sorry.

433
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,343
A very, very talented
young rapper.

434
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:08,580
Oh, you manage rap?

435
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,747
(clears throat)

436
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,383
Yes.
I manage rap.

437
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:15,553
There is nothing wrong
with earning money

438
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:17,655
doing something with rap,
it's fine.

439
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:20,191
Well, it's not just
about money.

440
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:22,360
You know it's--you know,
he--he's my cousin.

441
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:23,428
-He's family.
-Yeah.

442
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,196
Honey, you're missing the point.

443
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:27,065
It's not about money.
This is bigger than money.

444
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,267
Paper Boi is underground.

445
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,102
I've been following Paper Boi
since the start.

446
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,437
That's how I knew you!

447
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,105
I mean, since the shooting?

448
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,674
Your pictures were everywhere.

449
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:39,611
Shooting?

450
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,247
Well, you aren't gonna
shoot up this party,

451
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:44,382
are you, Earn?

452
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:48,786
Mm...no,
I wasn't planning on it.

453
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:50,888
(laughing)

454
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,223
I'm kidding.

455
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:53,791
I get it.

456
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,460
Can't choose your family, huh?

457
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,595
Every decent person has at least

458
00:20:57,597 --> 00:21:00,531
one trifling thug in the family.

459
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:01,499
(chuckles)

460
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:09,207
Oh, honey, let's go
say "hello" to--

461
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:11,442
Eh, no.
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:14,112
This is whack.
This is--this is whack.

463
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:15,980
-Babe, please.
-No, no.

464
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:18,116
Okay, like, this isn't
real life, okay?

465
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:20,785
This--this party is dumb.
She's dumb.

466
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:23,054
This is all dumb.
You know that, Van.

467
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:24,722
-This is dumb.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

468
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:26,591
-This is dumb.
-We're gonna head out, right?

469
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:28,259
And you know what?

470
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:30,928
Stop stunting on me
about my culture.

471
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,131
Like, I'm not gonna
go back to Africa

472
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:35,233
and find my roots,
because you know what?

473
00:21:35,235 --> 00:21:36,968
-I'm sorry.
-I'm fucking broke, dude.

474
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,436
-I'm broke.
-It's my bad.

475
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:40,071
-No, don't do that.
-Hey.

476
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:42,440
Don't "my bad" it.
And stop being so likable.

477
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:44,008
Stop being so likable,
like, I get--don't--

478
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,077
and don't be like
"I understand"--

479
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,512
-Earn, we're heading out now.
-Because you don't understand.

480
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,813
-We're going now.
-Like, I'm--

481
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:50,581
-Good night.
-For your hospitality.

482
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,950
Okay, well, we--we'd love
to see you soon.

483
00:21:52,952 --> 00:21:54,485
Thank you very much for coming.

484
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:55,920
-Mm-hmm.
-Good night.

485
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:57,488
-Mm-hmm.
-Happy Juneteenth.

486
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,157
-So weird.
-Great party. Let's go, babe.

487
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,159
So weird.
This is a weird place.

488
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,200
(engine rumbling)

489
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:18,276
I'll call her in the morning
and apologize.

490
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:19,243
I'm sorry.

491
00:22:22,282 --> 00:22:24,849
Pull over.

492
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:26,250
You sick?

493
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,097
You okay?
