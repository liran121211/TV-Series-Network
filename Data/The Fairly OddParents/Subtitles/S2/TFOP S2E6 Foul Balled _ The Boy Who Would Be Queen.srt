WHERE'S YOUR GIFT?

532
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,894
I BROUGHT A SPECIAL
KIND OF GIFT,

533
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,522
SOMETHING YOU CAN'T WRAP
UP AND PUT IN A BOX.

534
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,649
IS IT
A DEADLY GERM?

535
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,649
A GHOST?

536
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,528
NOPE, EVEN BETTER
THAN A DEADLY GERM
OR A GHOST.

537
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,115
TRIXIE, AHEM, BLAH--
WHAT YOU KNOW.

538
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,658
I LIKE YOU
FOR WHO YOU ARE.

539
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,868
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH--
NOT FOR WHAT EVERYONE

540
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,037
EXPECTS YOU TO BE...
A FRIEND TO YOU.

541
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,247
SOMEONE WHO ISN'T
AFRAID TO SAY,

542
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,916
"HEY, I LIKE
KISSY KISSY, GOO GOO

543
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,292
AND  SKULL SQUISHER."

544
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,754
OH, MY GOSH!
THAT IS SO SWEET.

545
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,090
[GASPS]

546
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,425
BUT, UH...

547
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,010
THAT'S WHAT
I HAVE GIRLFRIENDS FOR.

548
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,595
SECURITY!

549
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,595
HUH?

550
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,723
BYE, TIMMY TURNER!

551
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,725
HEY!

552
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,561
YOU REMEMBERED MY NAME!

553
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,604
TOLD YOU
SHE'D WANT A GIFT.

554
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,564
IT WORKED!

555
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,649
BECAUSE I TREATED
TRIXIE LIKE A PERSON

556
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,900
INSTEAD OF JUST A GIRL,

557
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,776
SHE REMEMBERED MY NAME.

558
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,071
BUT SHE CATAPULTED YOU
OUT OF THE PARTY.

559
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,532
YEAH, BUT SHE
DID IT WITH LOVE.

560
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,075
AND THAT NEVER
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

561
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,368
IF YOU HADN'T
MADE ME A GIRL.

562
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,579
THANKS. BUT DON'T EVER
DO IT AGAIN!

563
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,579
DEAL!

564
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:15,125
I WISH YOU GUYS WERE BACK
TO THE WAY YOU WERE BORN.

565
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,627
WHAT?

566
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,295
THIS IS THE NOSE
I WAS BORN WITH.

567
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,254
CAN'T A GUY
DO SOMETHING

568
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,965
TO MAKE HIMSELF
LOOK PRETTY?

569
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,426
BLAH, BLAH--
BLAH!

570
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,844
BLAH, BLAH--BLAH!

571
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,263
WELL, YOUR PARENTS
DON'T EXPECT YOU HOME
FOR A FEW HOURS.

572
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,183
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO NOW?

573
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,019
AHH! IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
SCRUBBING ALL MY TROUBLES AWAY.

574
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,562
I'VE NEVER MET A BOY
SENSITIVE ENOUGH

575
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,481
TO WALK IN HERE
BY HIMSELF.

576
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,983
I TOTALLY WANT YOU
TO DATE MY DAUGHTER.

577
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,110
NO, HE SHOULD
DATE MINE!

578
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,738
I'M SO PROUD
OF TIMMY.

579
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,738
YEAH!

580
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,656
HE FINALLY
FIGURED OUT

581
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,825
THAT WOMEN LOVE
SENSITIVITY.

582
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,786
AW!

583
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,954
AND IF YOU CAN FAKE THAT,
YOU'RE IN! OHH!

584
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,331
Man on TV:
I'VE GOT BAD NEWS.

585
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,500
RODERICK ASKED FOR A RAISE,
AND HE'S OFF THE SHOW--

586
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,044
I MEAN, FELL DOWN

587
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,004
Women: RODERICK, NO!

588
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,839
HEY, WHO WANTS
TO WATCH WRESTLING?

589
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,717
Women: WE DO!

590
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,304
