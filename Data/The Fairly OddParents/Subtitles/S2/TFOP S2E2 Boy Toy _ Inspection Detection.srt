177
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,251
HI, MRS. SAW!

178
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,503
I'M COSMO
AND THIS IS WANDA.

179
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,880
DON'T YOU WANT
TO BE A GOOD HOST?

180
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,049
NO! THOSE ARE
TIMMY'S DOLLS!

181
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,053
OH, THAT CHANGES
EVERYTHING.

182
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,140
HEY! MR. FIRE!
HAVE YOU MET WANDA?

183
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,852
OH, NO! HE'S

[CRASH!]

186
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,744
WHAT WAS THAT?

187
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:19,582
BAD DOG! YOU KNOW
YOU'RE ONLY SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT OUTSIDE,

188
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,042
OR AT TIMMY'S HOUSE!

189
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,294
CHIN! CHIN!

190
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,128
SPEAK TO ME!

191
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,254
I'M SORRY I GOT YOU
INTO THIS MESS.

192
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,008
I PROMISE...
I'LL NEVER LET
ANYTHING HURT YOU AGAIN.

193

[REPEATS OVER AND OVER]
YOU'RE...YOU'RE...

194
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,187

BEST PAL.

195
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,188
COSMO! WANDA!

196
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,608
I WISH I WAS
NORMAL SIZED!

197
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,153
COME ON, TIMMY.

198
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,614
LET'S GET YOU
AND YOUR STUPID DOLL
AND GET OUT OF HERE!

199
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,782
HE'S NOT STUPID!

200
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,783
HE'S MY FRIEND.

201
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,202
AND I SHOULD HAVE
TREATED HIM BETTER.

202
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,746
NO!

203
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,457
VICKY'S STOLEN
TIMMY'S DOLLS.

204
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,292
NOW HE'LL NEVER
COME OVER,

205
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,962
AND HE'LL
NEVER LIKE ME.

206
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,756
WHY DOESN'T HE LIKE ME?!

207
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,966
WAAAAHHH!

208
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,467
MAYBE HE'S NOT
THE ONLY ONE YOU
SHOULD TREAT BETTER.

209
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,885
YOU KNOW,
SHE MIGHT BE CREEPY,

210
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,639
BUT SHE DOES HAVE
TO PUT UP WITH VICKY
MORE THAN YOU DO.

211
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,015
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

212
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,225
VICKY LIVES HERE.

213
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,727
I GUESS WHEN
SHE'S NOT TORTURING ME
AT MY HOUSE,

214
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,771
SHE'S TORTURING
TOOTIE HERE.

215
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,982
THAT'S GOTTA BE
THE WORST.

216
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,734
UH...HI, TOOTIE.

217
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,778
TIMMY! HI!

218
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,029
I...

219
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,781
WAIT. YOU'RE ONLY
HERE TO TAKE BACK
YOUR STUPID DOLLS

220
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,200
AND THEN HIT ME
WITH ANOTHER
WATER BALLOON!

221
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:41,789
ACTUALLY, I WANTED
TO SAY I'M SORRY
I WAS MEAN TO YOU.

222
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,499
YOU SEE,
I'M JUST...

223
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,500
A STUPID
10 YEAR OLD BOY!

224
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,296
RIGHT. AND I'M NOT
INTERESTED IN GIRLS.

225
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,089
AND I WON'T BE UNTIL...

226
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,092
HE'S A STUPID
11 YEAR OLD BOY!

227
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,136
THEN...THERE'S HOPE?

228
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,221
THERE'S HOPE!

229
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,264
I SHOULD DO SOMETHING
NICE FOR HER.

230
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,308
MAKE UP, YOU KNOW?

231
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,810
SHE'S NOT MEAN.
SHE'S JUST A GIRL.

232
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,103
IT'S NOT HER FAULT.

233
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,690
I'M TOTALLY INTO
THE IDEA OF YOU
GIVING ME TO TOOTIE!

234
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,860
THIS WAY, SHE'LL
ALWAYS HAVE A LITTLE
PIECE OF YOU

235
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,195
SHE CAN SMOTHER
AND CHOKE WITH LOVE.

236
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,991
WOW! THAT WAS
AN ODDLY SPECIFIC
ACTION PHRASE.

237
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,617
I'M GONNA MISS YOU,
PAL.

238
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,494
I PUT THE "MAN"
IN MANDIBLE!

239
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,830
TOOTIE, I WANT YOU.
TO HAVE THIS.

240
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,374
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I WANT YOU
TO HAVE THIS

241
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,252
AND NEVER, EVER, EVER
FOLLOW ME HOME AGAIN.

242
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,920
OH, TIMMY!

243
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,798
THIS IS THE BEST
GIFT EVER!

244
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:37,303

WOW, WHEN IT RAINS...
IT MELTS!

251
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,523
I WISH THE CHIN DOLL
WAS INDESTRUCTIBLE

252
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,527
AND HAD 12,000
"I HATE VICKY"
ACTION PHRASES.

253
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,908

I WISH WE WERE
BACK AT THE TREE HOUSE.

258
