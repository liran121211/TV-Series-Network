532
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,102
SKATING ON THE MOON,

533
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,063
RAMPING DOWN
THE PYRAMIDS,

534
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,481
SKATING IN THE JUNGLE,

535
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,401

HOW CAN YOU DO THAT
WHEN I COULDN'T?

555
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,784
BECAUSE TIMMY'S
SMALL AND NICE.
