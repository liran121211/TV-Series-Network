This is a letter for A.J.

I'm in A.J.'s room.

Oh, man, I must have followed  
       the wrong letter.

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,383
So, Doctor,                     
if you attach the seed thrower

148
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,085
to the back of your satellite,

149
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,854
it'll plant seeds        
   while it orbits the earth,

150
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,556
thus ending world hunger.

That's brilliant, A.J.

152

NASA thanks you,        
   and the World thanks you.

And...?

Well, time to check my E-mail.

Hey, something opened my letter 
      from the President.

Okay, the room's fixed,

288
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,604
and the computer's
              still safe.

289
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,905
Now what do you want to do?

290
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,843
Recording proof of fairies.   
  Recording proof of fairies.

291
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,178
I don't know.

292
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,513
What do you
                     want to do?

293
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,648
I don't know.

294
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,016
Let's have a magic fight        
just for the heck of it.

295
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,184
Oh, why not?

296
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,186
It's not like anybody

297
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,887
can see what we're doing        
in here.

298
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,026
Yeah, it'd sure stink

299
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,864
if somebody was actually    
       recording this...

300
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,200
and had irrefutable proof    
      that some kid had...

301
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,369
Fairy godparents! Yes!

302
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,737
Denzel.                     
                        Mother.

303
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,373
Excellent.           
           (<i> laughs</i> )

304
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:26,811
I, Mr. Crocker, finally have  
    irrefutable video proof

305
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,879
that fairies exist.

306
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,750
Now all I have to do      
      is upload this data.

307
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,719
Then, using the Internet,

308
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,255
transmit it to every computer  
         in the world.

309
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:40,391
And with the unparalleled speed 
        of my computer,

310
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,127
it should take no time at all.

311
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,396

312
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,932
One percent.

313
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:48,700
Yay!

314
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,534
Zero percent.

315
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,905
Boo! Curses, obsolete,     
   one-month-old technology!

316
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,073
Negative one percent.

317
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,308
Drat!

318
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,389
Look at that massive stream   
           of e-mail.

319
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,625
Maybe my threatmantic letter's 
           in there.

320
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,927
Junk mail, junk mail. Oh, man.

321
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,862
My letter isn't anywhere    
         in this batch.

322
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,698
I'm doomed to be        
     a total laughingstock.

323
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,434
What happened? Where am I?

324
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,103
(<i> screams</i> )

325
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:28,339
Trixie?

326
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,175
"Trixie, how are you? Veronica."

327
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,445
Wow! I'm in a chat room     
   with Trixie and Veronica.

328
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,881
Hey, Veronica, I am
             fine and popular.

329
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,983
I'm just about to read

330
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,685
all my e-mail.

331
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,253
No!

332
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,764
Dear Trixie, as  
               your best friend,

333
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,898
I wish you nothing but happiness
        and eternal joy

334
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,235
for your whole life long.

335
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,408
Why can't I be you?!

336
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,843
WOMAN:   
                       Veronica,
                       dinner.

337
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,246
Don't call me that!       
        Call me Trixie!

338
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,748
I'm Trixie!

339
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,950
I've got to follow       
       Veronica's e-mail

340
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,385
back to Trixie's computer.

341
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,587
I'll just send a message,    
      attach myself to it,

342
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,022
and end up on her screen.

343
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:21,125
But I have to say something that
 she'd expect Veronica to say.

344
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,431
"Do you think Timmy Turner   
           is neat?"

345
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,203
Do I think Timmy Turner

346
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,737
is neat?

347
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,106
Why? Do you?

348
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,209
Do I think Timmy Turner is neat?

349
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,379
Actually, my love for him burns

350
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,481
with the white-
                 hot intensity  
                 of 1,000 suns,

351
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,049
but I can't let Trixie     
           know that.

352
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,651
"No way. He's gross."

353
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,620
Aw, great.           
    The crazy one likes me.

354
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,462
My letter! Yes!

355
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,066
(<i> laughs</i> ):           
          This rocks!

356
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,736
I've got my letter,       
  and I'm not a laughingstock,

357
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,904
and best of all,        
    for the first time ever,

358
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,640
things didn't fall apart    
    when I made a big wish.

359
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,682
Finally, I have proof, proof,

360
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,051
of the existence        
      of fairy godparents!

361
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,521
You guys!

362
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,023
Shh, Mr. Crazy is talking.      
Say hi, Timmy.

363
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,860
Shh! If he doesn't know
         whose fairies we are,

364
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,295
then we don't have 
             to go away forever.

365
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,298
Once I upload this video file  
         of you fairies

366
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,400
and send it to every computer  
         in the world,

367
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,869
I'll cease being        
        a laughingstock.

368
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,905
Then I will be the man

369
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:44,442
who proved that fairies     
        actually exist.

370
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,079
Cosmo, Wanda,          
     turn the computer off!

371
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,947
But we've got          
     to get you out first.

372
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,217
Who did that?

373
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,187
No, now, before he figures out 
     whose fairies you are.

374
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,991
Um, that's off, right?

375
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,359
Cosmo? Wanda?

376
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,894
Must've destroyed the computer.

00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,329
Crocker's video footage.

I've got to get it before    
 it gets back to his computer.

Uh, Dad,

Sure. I'll make a new one.

383
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,881
Almost to Crocker's computer.

I must be in Crocker's

That's it!

were reported today,

"It does make me feel pretty.

Can this get any worse?

475
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,671
There he is!

476
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,139
This is where          
     I've traced the source

477
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,706
of the pink-hatted

Oh, Denzel,           
     where did I go wrong?

You're not supposed to be    
  on those kinds of Web sites.

But that's my teacher.

Well, it does          
     make him look pretty.

Nice party, Timmy.

Aren't you upset        
that you're here without a date?

Are you nuts?

become a virus, humiliate    
   Crocker on a global scale,

494
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,025
and most importantly,      
         prevent Trixie

from reading this mushy,

most threatening thing     
        I've ever read.

Uh, really?

501
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:27,711
Sure. And if I didn't think     
you only wanted to date me

502
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,513
because I'm prettier            
than your mom,

503
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,448
I'd totally go out with you.
