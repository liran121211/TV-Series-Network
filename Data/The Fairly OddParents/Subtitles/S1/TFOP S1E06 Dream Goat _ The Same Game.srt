THEY'RE STILL GOOFY

523
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,128
AND BENDER
IS STILL A JERK!

524
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,839
I CHANGED THEIR OUTSIDES,
NOT THEIR INSIDES!

525
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,465
MOM, CAN I HAVE YOUR
HIDEOUS PINK CASSEROLE?

526
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,426
SURE!

527
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,427
THERE'S NO TIME
TO LOSE!

528
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,474
IF I CHANGE MY OUTSIDE,

529
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,393
THEN COSMO AND WANDA
CAN FIND ME.

530
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:46,977
I HOPE.

531
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,314
COSMO! WANDA! IT'S ME...

532
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,108
WITH MY PINK HAT!
I'M DIFFERENT!

533
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,651
LOOK! DIFFERENT!

534
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,613
HEY! WHO'S THE FREAK
WITH THE PINK ON HIS HEAD?

535
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,032
LET'S GET HIM
AND GRAY HIM UP!

536
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,577
I CAN'T FIND TIMMY
ANYWHERE,

537
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,120
AND...UH-OH!

538
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,873
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
ALL EXPLODY!

539
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,837
COSMO! WANDA!
IT'S ME! TIMMY!

540
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,881
I SEE A LITTLE
PINK DOT!

541
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,425
THAT'S OUR LITTLE
PINK DOT!

542
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:18,800
YOU FOUND ME!

543
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,886
OF COURSE.

544
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,095
YOU STICK OUT LIKE
A BIG, SORE, PINK THUMB.

545
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,848
UH, LESS TALKY,
MORE WISHY!

546
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,807
I WISH I WAS
DIFFERENT AGAIN.

547
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,892
I WISH THE WHOLE WORLD
WAS BACK TO THE WAY

548
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,311
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE!

549
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,494
MY TEETH! MY HEAD!
MY HAT! MY GOSH!

550
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,662
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

551
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,830
JUST MAKE
ANOTHER WISH.

552
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,834
[ALL SIGH]

553
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,461
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
TIMMY?

554
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,712
WHY AREN'T YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS

555
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,798
HITTING EACH OTHER
IN THE HEAD WITH YOUR BALL?

556
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,257
AW, THAT CREEP DENTIST
DOWN THE STREET

557
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,676
WON'T GIVE ME
MY BALL BACK

558
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,344
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
LIKE MY TEETH.

559
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,512
OH, REALLY?

560
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,555
WELL, LET'S SEE
IF WE CAN REASON
WITH HIM.

561
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,894
Dr. Bender: NOW GO,
OTHER BAD-TOOTHED BOY

562
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,855
AND NEVER DARKEN
OUR DOORWAY AGAIN

563
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,608
WITH YOUR HORRIBLE
BITE RADIUS.

564
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,152
HERE'S YOUR NEW
BOOMERANG, WENDELL.

565
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:24,199
HA HA! THIS SURE
IS A FUN BOOMERANG
THAT'S MINE NOW!

566
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,409
HA HA!

567
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,827
[WHISTLE]

568
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,453
GIVE ME BACK
MY BALL, WENDELL.

569
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,372
WHAT'S THE WORD
I'M LOOKING FOR?

570
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,124
OH, YEAH. NO!

571
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,959
HA HA HA!

572
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,836
YOU MUST BE
DR. BENDER,

573
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,504
AND THAT MUST BE
TIMMY'S BALL.

574
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,880
MAY WE HAVE IT BACK?

575
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,802
IN THIS ORDER--
RIGHT, RIGHT, AND NO,
MAMA TOOTH-FACE.

576
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,847
WELL, YOU CLEARLY
DON'T KNOW THE RULES
OF TIMMY-BALL.

577
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,098
OH?

578
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,891
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU PLAY IT LIKE THIS.

579
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,102
[CRASH]

580
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,688
YOU KNOW, TIMMY.
PERFECT TEETH
MIGHT BE NICE,

581
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,732
BUT IF THEY'RE
IN A MOUTH THAT'S MEAN,

582
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,609
THEY MIGHT AS WELL
NOT BE IN THE MOUTH AT ALL.

583
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,903
THANKS, MOM.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU JUST SAID,

584
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,739
BUT IT SURE MAKES ME
FEEL BETTER.

585
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,325
MY DENTURES! GIVE ME BACK
MY PERFECT TEETH!

586
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:07,993
JUMP BALL. COME ON.

587
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,787
YOU WANT IT?
WORK FOR IT.

588
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,789
AND, DUDE, YOU LEFT
THESE AT MY HOUSE.

589
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,000
AAH!

590
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,753
THOSE DON'T
BELONG IN THERE!

591
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,671
WHO WANTS TO PLAY
TIMMY-BALL?

592
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,922
All: UH, WELL, I...

593
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,592
UHH!

594
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,592
OUCH!

595
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,592
OOH!

596
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,968
All: AAH!

597
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,554
HEY, CUT IT OUT!
NO FAIR! I'M HAIRLESS!

598
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,139
Mom: OH, COME ON,
YOU GUYS.

599
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:29,931
WHERE'S YOUR
GAME FACE?

600
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,058
BRING IT ON.

601
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,560
IS THERE
A MESSAGE THERE?

602
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,644
I THINK IT'S THIS.

603
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,772
IF YOU'RE PLAYING
TIMMY-BALL, WEAR A HELMET.

604
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,023
WHAT ABOUT
WANDA-BALL?

605
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,608
I KNOW THAT GAME!

606
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,610
DID YOU KNOW I USE
A CINDER BLOCK?

607
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,445
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
AAH!

608
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,447
Wanda: COME ON.
BRING IT ON, MEAT.

609
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,407
I GOT YOUR GAME
RIGHT HERE.

610
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,076
OH, IS THAT ALL
YOU GOT? COME ON.
