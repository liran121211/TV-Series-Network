321
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,823
When Christmas is over,         
the magic comes back to us.

322
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,692
But now, because                
it's Christmas every day,

323
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,661
it won't.

324
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,329
We're practically powerless.

325
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,098
Because of this kid...

326
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,000
it's always           
     going to be Christmas.

327
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,002
Which means                     
we don't get to share

328
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,737
our holidays with the kids.

329
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:00,938
What's up with that?

330
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,406
I just wanted
                   more toys,

331
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,142
and to spend more time
          with my mom and dad.

332
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,578
And now everybody's       
     so sick of Christmas,

333
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,680
they even want         
      to get rid of Santa.

334
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,115
He's right.

335
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,284
As long as Santa's around
       this could happen again.

336
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,351
Right.

337
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,420
All we need to do               
is banish Santa

338
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,789
to the imaginary day            
of February 33rd

339
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,124
and get rid                     
of him for good.

340
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,260
But to do that, we'll
           need a little magic.

341
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,527
(<i> gasping</i> )

342
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,530
Yeah, you two      
             are a<i> little</i> magic.

343
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,799
I'll be here all week.
          I'll be here all week.

344
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,134
Okay.

345
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,302
Let's get hopping.

346
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,804
Santa's in trouble,

347
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,240
and it's all my fault.

348
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,408
I've got            
   to get to the North Pole.

349
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,844
(<i> "Pop Goes the Weasel" plays</i> )

350
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,014
Oh, this is hopeless.

351
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,049
There's nothing here that'll  
 help me get to the North Pole.

352
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,250
DAD:                            
Darn it.

353
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,218
I've looked under this          
high-speed snowmobile,

354
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,521
portable power generator,    
    all this survival gear,

355
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,556
a detailed map from our house  
       to the North Pole,

356
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,759
so simple that even       
a ten-year-old child could read,

357
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:57,328
and I can't find    
            the eggnog anywhere!

358
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,665
This trip could be       
     potentially dangerous,

359
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,333
even life-threatening.

360
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,735
Cool.

361
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,405
But in case I don't die,    
  I better have a backup plan.

362
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:11,142
Santa's in trouble, and I'm   
 off to the North Pole to help.

363
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,378
<i> If you see me, wish me luck.</i>

364
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,679

00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,383

369
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,256
Feels like I've been
            gone for weeks.

370
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:28,959
And at this speed,       
   I'll be there in no time.

376
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,236
Think it's mighty fine     
  what you're doing for Santa.

377
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,504
Merry Christmas.

378
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,006
Or as we say in Montana,

379
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,874
you're standing
                 in cow manure.

00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,009
Awesome.

No food. So hungry.

00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,885
Must eat log book.

384
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,520

                        Bonjour.

00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,190
Are you the one                 
they call Timmy Turner?

386
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,858
Uh,<i> oui.</i>

387
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,961
We got your message       
        on the Internet,

388
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,795
even here in northern Quebec.

                We wish you luck
                in your mission.

<i> Merci.</i>

391
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,600
You can keep the snails.

392
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,241
I made it all the way across  
     the ocean to Greenland

393
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,742
and nothing bad happened.

394
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,612
(<i> growling</i> )

395
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,047
Well, that's inconvenient.

396
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,115
APRIL FOOL:           
          Greenland.

397
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,916
It's not green      
            and there's no land.

398
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,452
What's up with that?

399
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,355
Just one country away from   
 getting rid of Santa for good.

400
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:35,393
Yeah, and then we'll be able  
to create our own super-holiday.

401
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,996
Hallneweasterweenentine Day.

402
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:42,199
Hallneweasterweenentine         
Day?

403
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,834
I didn't think 
                 you'd remember.

404
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:44,702
Hey!

405
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,170
Who the heck
                    is that?

406
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,439
Hi. Am I too late               
to get Santa?

407
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,240
Who are you?

408
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,041
I'm a holiday, like you.

409
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,210
I'm, uh, Birthday Boy.

410
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,145
Hop in.

411
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,113
I do the hopping around here.

412
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,918
ALL:              
No more toys for girls and boys!

413
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,253
No more toys          
      for girls and boys!

414
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,191
SANTA:           
               These toys stink!

415
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,964
I'm running out         
       of creative ideas.

416
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,299
Kris, you're working            
yourself to death.

417
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,734
I don't care, honey.

418
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,603
As long as it's Christmas,
      and I've got the magic,

419
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,539
I have to give the children
     what they wished for.

420
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,777
Psst! Cosmo. Wanda.

421
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:27,778
Timmy?

422
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,780
No, Timmy has a pink hat.

423
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,215
That's Birthday Boy.

424
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:34,017
Listen, I've got to get     
    to Santa before they do,

425
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,319
but I'm going to need help.

426
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,920
But we don't have any magic.

427
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,555
But you do have those.

428
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,959
Hey, these tires                
were flattened

429
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,096
with two fairy                  
godparent crowns.

430
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,765
Who could have done that?

431
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,099
And where's your diaper?

432
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,568
This diaper may be stinky,

433
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:51,935
but it sure is fast.

434
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,372
I'm traveling          
     at the speed of smell!

435
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,839
(<i> crashing</i> )

436
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,542
Santa!

437
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,709
We've got to get you            
out of here.

438
00:17:58,778 --> 00:17:59,977
Who are you,

439
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,612
and why do you smell      
      like a dirty diaper?

440
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,013
I'm Timmy Turner.

441
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,282
I'm the dope who wished         
it would be Christmas every day.

442
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,552
Well, son, wanting peace
        and joy in the world

443
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,522
each and every day       
       is a wonderful sentiment.

444
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,058
But you're getting coal     
   for the rest of your life.

445
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,192
COMPUTER:       
                You've got coal.

446
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,728
Fine.

447
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,163
I don't care if I never get   
 another decent present again.

448
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,699
You're both in                  
a lot of danger and...

449
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,035
Oh, no! They're here!

450
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,407
What are you lesser holidays  
          doing here?

451
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,876
We want to stop Christmas    
 and we're here for the magic.

452
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,379
Get him!            
      Darn it. Mistletoe.

453
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,149
ALL:              
    I like you as a friend.     
     You're a good person.

454
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:41,017
You've jingled         
      your last bell, bub.

455
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,059
Get him!

456
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,733
WANDA:                          
Hey, they're using us           
like sponges

457
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,268
to absorb the magic from Santa.

458
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,812
I find...

459
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,614
no joy...

460
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,851
in this!

461
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:20,791
Losing... holiday... spirit.

462
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,259
He's weakening.

463
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,593
What's up with that?

464
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,068
Not so jolly now, huh, Kringle?

465
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,202
New Year, hit me.

466
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,573
Oh, no!

467

(<i> laughing</i> )

468
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,080
When this double Grade-A egg  
           explodes,

469
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:47,017
it'll blow you to February 33rd,
     which does not exist,

470
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,186
then Christmas will             
never come again.

471
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,921
No! Leave him alone!

472
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,189
It's not his fault.

473
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,291
I'll never let you hurt Santa!

474
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,960
How you going to stop us, huh?

475
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,461
You're just one                 
little kid.

476

                   No, he ain't.

477
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,369
He's just the kid        
      who got here first.

(<i> whinnying</i> )

00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,449
Wow, it's every Web-enabled kid 
         in the world.

(<i> cheering</i> )

481
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,489
We can't fight kids.

482
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,356
Can we?

483
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,557
No.

484
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,393
We wanted Santa gone...

485
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,428
so we could bring our own

486
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,064
holiday-specific joy      
          to children.

487
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,899
So they'd love us, too.

488
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,868
That's what's up                
with that.

489
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,803
But we do love you guys.

490
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:40,904
ALL:              
            Really?

491
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,607
What's up with that?    
    Hey.

492
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,642
Just, you know, not as much.

493
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,410
I mean, Santa brings us toys,

494
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,512
and Christmas brings            
our families together.

495
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,114
Birthday Boy's
                  got a point.

496
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,583
All I do is leave eggs that   
  go bad if you don't find them.

497
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:57,822
And all I do is get kids to play
horrible pranks on one another.

498
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,824
Yeah, but I make kids      
 fall in love with each other.

499
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,860
ALL:              
              Eww!

500
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,760
Point taken.

501
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,295
We're sorry, Santa.

502
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,764
We were both stupid             
and jealous.

503
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,476
(<i> cheering</i> )

504
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,344
Will you ever                   
forgive us, Santa?

505
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,912
I don't have time
               to forgive you.

506
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,246
Tomorrow's Christmas again,

507
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,982
and as long as         
      it's still Christmas

508
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,117
I have to give the kids     
      what they wish for.

509
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,085
That's it!

510
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,553
That's how we fix this.

511
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,922
Do you know why it will be   
   Christmas again tomorrow?

512
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,657
Because we keep                 
telling Santa

513
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,192
we want some                    
toy or doll,

514
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,527
or some stupid thing.

515
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,996
And Christmas Day,     
         Santa grants our wishes

516
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,164
whatever                        
they may be.

517
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,532
But if every kid in the world

518
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
wished for it to be       
    the day after Christmas,

519
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,070
that's what Santa        
   would have to bring to us.

520
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,471
December 26th!

Quick, everyone         
     write Santa a letter.
