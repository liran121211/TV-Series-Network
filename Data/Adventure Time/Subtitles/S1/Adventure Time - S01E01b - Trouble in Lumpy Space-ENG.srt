4
00:00:10,904 --> 00:00:12,959
Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess.

5
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:20,498
Princess, this tea party sucks
in a big way!

6
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:21,748
But thanks for the invite!

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,319
Oh, don't worry, Finn.

8
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:26,756
The Mallow Tea Ceremony
takes <i>years</i> to master.

9
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,436
Princess! I think I just now mastered it!

10
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:31,405
One more bounce.

11
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:32,647
Alright!

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,913
Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake?

13
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:36,718
Oof! Yes!

14
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:37,257
What?!?

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,382
No way! It's super easy!

16
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:41,789
Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker!

17
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:43,726
You're <i>floating</i>, not <i>bouncing</i>!

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,343
Fine. I'll prove it.

19
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:51,945
Oh. Sorry I bit your leg.

20
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,461
You're <i>still</i> biting me!!

21
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:55,640
Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry.

22
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,016
Dude! Your leg!

23
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:58,906
This is... <i>new</i>.

24
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:01,008
'S nothin' ominous, though. Just a bump.

25
00:01:01,023 --> 00:01:04,594
Nah, that's no bump.
It's the early stage of the lumps.

26
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,171
Is it serious?

27
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:09,336
It just means he's turning into
a Lumpy Space guy,

28
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:10,758
on account of my bite.

29
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:11,836
It's just like, uhm...

30
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:12,742
...y'know...

31
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:13,914
...werewolf rules?

32
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,531
Oh no!!!

33
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:19,054
What? You think I'm gonna turn
all lumpy like her?

34
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:19,936
Get outta here.

35
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:20,788
Wha?!?

36
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:22,890
Finn, I think I'm freakin' out!

37
00:01:22,913 --> 00:01:24,429
Calm down, bud! I'll...

38
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:26,070
I'll <i>sock</i> the lumpiness outta ya!

39
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,015
Hey, now!

40
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:30,085
Royal intervention!

41
00:01:30,108 --> 00:01:32,804
Surely there must be an antidote
to the lumps.

42
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:37,389
Yeah. There's an antidote, but you have
to go all the way to Lumpy Space to get it

43
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:39,866
and, Jake has to use it by sunset.

44
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:42,944
What happens if he <i>doesn't</i>
take the antidote by sunset?

45
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:45,038
He'll be lumpy, like, forever.

46
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:47,913
LSP, please! Can you tell us
how to reach Lumpy Space?

47
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:49,968
Yeah, there's a portal nearby.

48
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:51,609
I can show you whenever.

49
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:53,538
Take us <i>now</i>! Take us <i>now</i>!

50
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:56,421
I should not have drunk that much tea!

51
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:59,560
Don't go telling anyone about this
portal or whatever.

52
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:00,568
...It's kind of a secret.

53
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:03,904
Where is it?

54
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:05,717
Portal's that Frog and mushroom.

55
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,357
Password, please.

56
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:09,951
Whatevers2009!!!

57
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:11,561
Good day, Princess.

58
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:16,998
Is your father okay with you entering
Lumpy Space with two...

59
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:18,912
...non-Lumpers?

60
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:19,788
Just say yes!

61
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,280
Yes, yes, yes!

62
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:22,460
Yeah, whatever, fine.

63
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:30,045
Whoa...

64
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:31,592
Lumpy Space!

65
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:35,506
So, where's the antidote?

66
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:37,506
Hold it. First, you should
check out my house.

67
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:41,529
It's, like, kinda lame, but way less
lame than, like, your house.

68
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:45,006
Could you skip to the part where
you tell us where the antidote is?

69
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:46,990
It's up there at Makeout Point.

70
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:49,154
That's so close! We can run there in no...

71
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:50,169
...time.

72
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:51,708
Aww, <i>what</i>?!?

73
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:54,185
It's, like, a million-mile fall into space!

74
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,904
Yeah. You have to travel
by car in my world,

75
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,241
or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss.

76
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:03,235
Daughter!! Have you brought smooth
people into our domain?!?

77
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:03,797
I...

78
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:04,703
...<i>had</i> to...

79
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:05,321
...dad.

80
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,321
I'm trying to <i>help</i> them.

81
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:09,336
So don't LUMPING YELL AT MEH!!!

82
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:10,891
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?

83
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:13,047
What did you just say?!?

84
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:16,196
I SAID, "LUMP OFF," MOM!!!

85
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:19,453
Uh...

86
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:20,062
WHAT?!?

87
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:21,086
Vroom vroom?

88
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,742
Oh, yeah!

89
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,086
I need to borrow the car.

90
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,649
You have made your mother cry
for the <i>last</i> time, daughter!

91
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,883
You are hereby <i>banned</i> from
using the royal car!!

92
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:32,711
Shucks! I lumping hate them!

93
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm really really sorry, Finn.

94
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:39,079
But I can't help you because
my parents are horrible idiots.

95
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,907
Don't you know anyone else with a car?

96
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:42,579
My friend Melissa has a car.

97
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:44,547
But she's dating my ex-boyfriend...

98
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:45,063
...Brad.

99
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:46,087
Call her...

100
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:47,173
...NOW.

101
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:50,243
Hmm. Call BFF 66.

102
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,664
Hello?

103
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:53,915
Hey, Melissa. What's up?

104
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:54,766
What's she saying?

105
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:56,321
I'm <i>asking</i> her, jeez!

106
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:57,938
Melissa, just listen!

107
00:03:57,985 --> 00:03:59,860
Have you forgotten what day it is?

108
00:03:59,883 --> 00:04:01,672
Melissa. I'm trying to help
out some friends.

109
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:05,102
Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!

110
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,688
Oh, Glob. I forgot.

111
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,555
<i>What'd</i> she say?

112
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:10,492
Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!

113
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,297
IT'S GONNA BE SO FLIPPIN' AWESOME!!

114
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:14,453
LSP, we don't have time for this.

115
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:16,782
Ask for the ride, LSP

116
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:20,532
Wha?!?

117
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:25,110
Melissa, you should totally drive us
to Makeout Point to...

118
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:27,385
...make out with hot boys!

119
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:31,261
LSP, you're so <i>baaaaad</i>...

120
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,463
Be there in a sec!

121
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:33,409
Biyah.

122
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:36,706
Sorry. But Jake's lumpiness is worsening!

123
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:40,019
Actually, I think I'm beating it back
with sheer willpower!

124
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:41,253
Oh, my.

125
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:42,815
Yeah, whatever.

126
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,589
Just don't mess with my phone again.

127
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:45,245
Hi!

128
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,932
Ugh... OKAY!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!!

129
00:04:53,906 --> 00:04:55,937
Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right?

130
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:58,312
Ah. I love this song.

131
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:00,672
We should totally TP Shandala's house!

132
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:03,242
Gracious!! That was terrible!

133
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:06,140
Finn, if you can't save me
from the lumps...

134
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:08,375
if I <i>do</i> turn...

135
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:11,375
...if I become lumpy like them,
I want you to...

136
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,859
It's not gonna come to that!

137
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:16,625
But if it does, I'll bury you beneath
the nicest, most shadiest tree!

138
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:18,273
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

139
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:21,047
I'm saying that <i>if</i> I go totally lumpy,

140
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,476
then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake.

141
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:25,249
What did you <i>think</i> I was sayin'?

142
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,734
CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!

143
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,164
We're already here!

144
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:31,281
Hi, Finn.

145
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:33,164
We've been here for, like,
five minutes.

146
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,312
Finally!

147
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:36,820
Huh? This doesn't look
like Makeout Point.

148
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:38,117
This is Brad's house.

149
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:41,078
<i>You</i> wanted a ride to Makeout Point?

150
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:44,117
You think <i>I</i> want to make out with <i>you</i>?!?

151
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,148
Well, maybe I do, but...

152
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,852
Wait. I have a boyfriend, Finn!!!

153
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,797
LSP, we gotta hurry!
Jake's running out of time!

154
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:56,922
Hey. This is hard for me, too.

155
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:59,446
I mean, I used to eat chili
cheese fries with Brad...

156
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:02,406
so there's gonna be a lot of
romantic tension on this ride!

157
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:02,962
Hey.

158
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:05,305
Oh, Braaaaad...

159
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,883
You miss me yet, LSP?

160
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:11,094
Scooch over, Finn.
I'm gonna sit in the back.

161
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,188
This is it.

162
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:15,336
Let's go!

163
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,133
Wait. Watch yourself, Finn.

164
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:20,400
The guys who use the antidote
up here are notorious...

165
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,228
...for being...

166
00:06:21,244 --> 00:06:23,415
...smooth posers!

167
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:24,658
What does <i>that</i> mean?

168
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:26,064
It just means what it means.

169
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:28,471
Hurry. Get the antidote
so we can get <i>outta</i> here.

170
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,479
Thanks, LSP.

171
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:31,463
Buuuumps...

172
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:33,978
Um... bumps.

173
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:35,557
Aw, man!

174
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:38,213
Hey, guys.

175
00:06:38,557 --> 00:06:39,604
Lookin' smooth!

176
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:41,823
Really? You think we're smooth?

177
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:43,760
Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah!

178
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:45,400
Why are you sucking up to us?

179
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,385
My best friend needs an antidote
for lumpiness.

180
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:49,455
Chyah, lumpiness suuucks.

181
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,229
Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere-hog!

182
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:52,401
My turn!

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,900
So the antidote is in that orb
you were sitting on!

184
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:59,807
This orb <i>is</i> the antidote, bruh.

185
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:00,854
Can my friend borrow it?

186
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:02,807
Yeah, sure, as long as you
give it right back.

187
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,072
Hammacow. Thanks, fellas.

188
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:06,557
What's <i>taking</i> so long?

189
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,315
Did those smooth-heads
give you the orb already, or <i>what</i>?

190
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:09,893
Wait!!

191
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:12,346
Is this <i>another</i> friend of yours??

192
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:13,087
What do you care?

193
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:16,049
Just give 'em the antidote already,
and stop being such a poser.

194
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:18,892
Sorry, kid. We changed our minds.

195
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:21,540
Why did you have to say all those
rude things to them?!?

196
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:23,165
What? I was helping you.

197
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,024
Thanks a lot!

198
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:25,985
They were right about to hand
over the antidote!

199
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,009
You're <i>welcome</i> a lot.

200
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:27,868
You insulted them!

201
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:28,720
And they got mad!

202
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:30,774
And now Jake's gonna be lumpy <i>forever</i>!

203
00:07:30,814 --> 00:07:32,321
This is all your fault!!!

204
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:34,087
Wow. Now I know how you <i>really</i> feel.

205
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:36,212
 I was just trying to help, but whatever.

206
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,869
No. No, <i>not</i> whatever!

207
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:43,181
I know I mess things up sometimes,
but I'm really trying!

208
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,313
And you guys are supposed to be my friends!

209
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:47,532
Not like the <i>fake</i> ones I have here!

210
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:48,882
So do what you want!

211
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:51,202
I'm going to Promcoming!

212
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,625
Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?

213
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,055
No. Because no matter how messed up
and lumpy I get,

214
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:59,711
this guy never turns his back on me!

215
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:02,016
Oh, yah. Right behind ya.

216
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,819
Just gotta turn my back on this guy.

217
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,905
Jake! It's almost sunset!!!

218
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,804
Jake...

219
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:09,367
...I didn't save him...

220
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,320
I...

221
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:17,766
I'LL KILL YOU LUMPY SPACE!!!

222
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,670
Jam on, man!

223
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:20,037
Huh? I thought you guys left!

224
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,358
We were drawn back by your plaintive wail.

225
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:24,335
We dig your directionless fury.

226
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:25,483
Um, thanks.

227
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,617
Respect.

228
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:27,577
Here...

229
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:30,531
Take it. Win your girl back!

230
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,765
Yeah, there's no girl.

231
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,664
But there <i>is</i> still time to save Jake!

232
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,507
Do you guys know where Promcoming is?!?

233
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:38,726
Promcoming takes place way down
on that land-lump.

234
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:40,742
Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels?

235
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:43,531
Nah. We were all ditched here
just like you.

236
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:46,680
Well... you think I can make it to that
land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?

237
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:47,727
You kidding?

238
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:50,518
A smoothie like you will plummet right
into the eternal void!

239
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,667
What if I was lumpy? Could I <i>float</i> over?

240
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:55,362
No, no! It's too dangerous!

241
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:58,332
I'd say there's a 50/50 chance
of you making it!

242
00:08:58,347 --> 00:08:59,488
That's good enough for me.

243
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:00,449
Now <i>bite</i> me!!

244
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:02,137
Are you crazy, man?

245
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:09,526
Yes! I can feel the multiple bite
accelerating the lumpification process!

246
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,246
I'm starting to float!

247
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:12,527
Don't jump, guy!!

248
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,378
I have to! For my buddy.

249
00:09:16,776 --> 00:09:18,394
Wow. He's insane.

250
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,089
Ah, I made it!

251
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:22,236
And there he is!

252
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:23,987
Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool!

253
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:25,846
Jake! I'm mostly lumpy now!

254
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:28,650
And I totally think you should
sit on this sphere!

255
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,338
No!

256
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:30,283
Sit on it!

257
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,588
No!

258
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:33,189
Please, Jake!

259
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,268
You're my best friend!
Just sit on the sphere!

260
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:38,048
Chyah! I remember you!

261
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:40,603
You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser!

262
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:43,283
Sit on it!!
Before I turn <i>completely</i> lumpy!!

263
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,072
No!

264
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:47,721
Oh, no! I can feel the lumpiness...
about to consume me!!

265
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:50,533
Oh, yah. Being lumpy's the best.

266
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:52,923
Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy.

267
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:54,386
Take your ball and get outta here.

268
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,151
Fine. I don't want you to have it anyway.

269
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,668
So I can't have it now, eh?

270
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,332
That's right. It's <i>mine</i>.

271
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:01,136
Gimme that ball!!!

272
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:02,394
No! You can't have it!

273
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,113
I want it!

274
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:03,472
No!

275
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:04,832
Give it to meh!

276
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:06,949
You want it that bad? Go <i>get</i> it, then!

277
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,777
Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore!

278
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:13,715
...Oh no...

279
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:16,027
Finn buddy! Ya gotta sit on this!!

280
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:16,855
No!!!

281
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:18,818
You can't make me! Smooth...

282
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,201
Finn...

283
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:22,201
Hey Finn!

284
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:23,341
Hey, buddy!

285
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:24,021
Finn!!!

286
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:24,513
Huh?!?

287
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,185
Hey, dude. We made it.

288
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:26,880
Man...

289
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:28,911
There's something cold under my butt.

290
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,935
Oh! The antidote!

291
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,247
Just in time, too!

292
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,841
LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before.

293
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:37,552
I didn't mean it.
I was just really stressed out.

294
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:38,692
You know, it's fine.

295
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:40,256
You and Jake can make it up to me

296
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,605
by dancing this last dance with me.

297
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,927
Sounds good to me. Whaddaya say, Jake?

298
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:46,817
That sounds totally lame.

299
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:49,512
I'm just kiddin'.

300
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:50,234
Let's dance!
