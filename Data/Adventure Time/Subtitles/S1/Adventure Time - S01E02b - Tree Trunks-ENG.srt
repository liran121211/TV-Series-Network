12
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:39,041
Swords! Yeah, swords!

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,595
Oh, men and their swords...

14
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:45,010
You boys, stop horsing
around with my apples!

15
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,994
Aw, Tree Trunks!

16
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:48,479
Now, come on over!

17
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:50,807
I baked y'all an apple pie.

18
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:53,128
Yeah, apple pie!

19
00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:55,503
I'm gonna eat it all before
you even <i>get</i> there!

20
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:01,185
Apple pie!

21
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:02,576
Don't let him eat it all!

22
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,154
Now, you boys sit down
and behave yourselves.

23
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:06,920
OH!

24
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:10,076
Shoo, fly! Get off my apple pie!

25
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:14,576
A fly landed on my pie.
That's no good.

26
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:16,356
Bye, pie!

27
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,013
Why are you throwing the pie away?

28
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:21,622
Flies wanted it?

29
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:23,653
They can have it.

30
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:25,911
Anyways, don't y'all worry

31
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:29,444
'cause the new pie is coming
in the wag of a lamb's tail.

32
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:30,826
New pie?

33
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:32,911
Pie, yeah!

34
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:34,396
Here you are.

35
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:36,833
Come on, go ahead.

36
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:42,586
What you think?

37
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:44,828
Best apple pie ever!

38
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,164
Oh, Jake...

39
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,578
Thank you, but that
ain't the <i>best</i> apple pie.

40
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,695
What are you talking 'bout,
Tree Trunks?

41
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,626
What can be better than your apple pie?

42
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:55,007
You ate all the pie...

43
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:58,399
Finn, what would you do
if you could do anything?

44
00:01:58,515 --> 00:01:59,429
Anything?

45
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:02,374
Well, I'd catch a shooting star,
travel to outer space

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,212
and fight space monsters!

47
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,447
I'd carve my face on the moon...

48
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:07,345
...so the moon...

49
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:08,400
...would look like my face!

50
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:09,713
What would <i>you</i> do, Tree Trunks?

51
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:12,665
I would go pick an apple.

52
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:14,032
...lame.

53
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:16,329
I'm sorry. I mean...

54
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:18,853
It's just you pick apples every day.

55
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,338
This apple ain't like
the apples that I pick.

56
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:25,384
They say it's the apple of apples;

57
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:27,790
rarest kind of all.

58
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:32,126
Legends call it the Crystal Gem Apple.

59
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,359
That sounds awesome!

60
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,039
Where is it?

61
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:40,407
I've heard that it grows at the
deepest end of the Evil Dark Forest.

62
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:43,671
Tree Trunks you <i>gotta</i> go pick that apple!

63
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:45,898
What? Me?

64
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:48,812
Oh, no I'm just a cute little elephant.

65
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:51,398
I'm not cut out for adventuring.

66
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,554
Tree Trunks! This is your dream!

67
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:55,280
Think about eating that apple...

68
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:56,827
...with your own...

69
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,827
...mouth!

70
00:02:57,905 --> 00:02:59,062
Or your trunk.

71
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:01,163
Imagine the flavor.

72
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:03,085
And your satisfied face.

73
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:03,945
Really?

74
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:07,640
You think I can handle
the Scary Dark Forest?

75
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:08,398
Yeah!

76
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:09,351
And we'll help you.

77
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:10,836
We love you, Tree Trunks.

78
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:12,312
Okay. I'll do it.

79
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,703
Call me...

80
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:16,367
...Adventurer Tree Trunks.

81
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:18,780
Tree Trunks!!!

82
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,687
I love being so high up
from the ground!

83
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:28,538
I can take you even higher
on <i>my</i> shoulders, Tree Trunks.

84
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,617
No, Jake. She has a weak heart.

85
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:31,897
Oh, yeah...

86
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:37,327
Why is this ground all squishy?

87
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:40,202
Whatever it is, I'm liking it.
Oh, yeah!

88
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:41,334
I wanna try!

89
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,545
Okay! I'm cool with you letting you
do whatever you want.

90
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,217
It's like some cookie dough!

91
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:51,842
Oh, hello there.

92
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,014
Uhh, Tree Trunks, stay away from that.

93
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:59,866
Ugh! You're gonna get it,
wall of flesh.

94
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:03,491
An eye...

95
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:05,248
...and a mouth!

96
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:09,920
Well, I think I got the perfect
thing for him or her:

97
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,037
stickers!

98
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:12,685
Careful, Tree Trunks,

99
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:13,905
this thing is evil!

100
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,827
Here's a rainbow sticker.

101
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:19,139
And here's a scratch-and-sniff sticker,

102
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:20,905
smells just like a pickle.

103
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:25,396
Oh, and this one
is a holographic unicorn,

104
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,834
but it doesn't have a horn

105
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,364
Oh, now, whatcha doing?

106
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:33,341
Huh? Tree Trunks!!!

107
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,131
You better stay in that tree, baby.

108
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:46,467
Tree Trunks were you putting <i>stickers</i>
 on that evil monster?

109
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:51,420
Yes, I thought it needed some
tender love and affection.

110
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:55,452
Oh, what a pretty butterfly!

111
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:57,779
Tree Trunks?

112
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:03,123
Jake, I just realized that Tree Trunks
is old and bonkers.

113
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:05,357
We can't take her through
this Evil Dark Forest.

114
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:08,263
Nah, she'll be fine. Everything's fine.

115
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,216
But the monsters?

116
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,106
It's fine. It's fine!

117
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,278
Are you sure? 'Cause she has zero
adventurer training.

118
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:16,622
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
It's fine, she'll be fine!

119
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:18,114
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

120
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:19,833
Maybe it <i>is</i> fine.

121
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:21,036
Tree Trunks?

122
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,661
Where'd she go?

123
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:22,919
Tree Trunks!!!

124
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:28,951
We gotta find her, Jake!

125
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:31,309
Where are you, Tree Trunks?

126
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,458
And here's your teacup...

127
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,435
...and here's <i>my</i> teacup.

128
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:38,357
Tree Trun...Oh!!!

129
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:40,724
And here's your sandwich.

130
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:42,638
Oops, you dropped it.

131
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:44,137
Tree Trunks, run!

132
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:45,410
Oh, hey, Finn.

133
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:50,098
Time to call your mamas,
evil sign posts.

134
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:58,410
Patience, boys.
There's enough tea for everyone.

135
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:01,449
No!!!

136
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:03,621
Oh, what a nice hug.

137
00:06:04,354 --> 00:06:05,535
I'm not hugging you...Ugh.

138
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:06,597
I'm trying to...Ugh!

139
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:07,753
save your life!

140
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:09,363
There's too many!!!

141
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:10,206
Finn?!?

142
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:19,948
Oh, Finn...

143
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:23,119
That tea party was crummier
than a big old biscuit.

144
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,448
Tree Trunks, I'm all jacked up
because of you.

145
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,948
Look at my jacked up face!

146
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:31,385
Are you mad at me?

147
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:34,057
No, I'm not mad.

148
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:36,346
You're too super-cute for me
to be mad at you,

149
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:38,346
and you're a top notch adventurer!

150
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:43,252
Now, let's go find and eat the heck out
of that crystal gem apple together.

151
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:47,072
Dang it!

152
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,784
You go fight.
I'll keep Tree Trunks out of trouble.

153
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:50,861
Awesome!

154
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:57,971
J-Jake I think Finn is getting
jacked up again.

155
00:06:57,995 --> 00:06:59,698
Yeah, Finn can handle it.

156
00:06:59,713 --> 00:07:00,534
He's 12!

157
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,158
I think I know a way to help him out.

158
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:05,666
Uhh, you should stay here, Tree Trunks.

159
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:08,924
But Finn said that
I was a top notch adventurer.

160
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,978
And my adventurer instincts

161
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:13,902
tell me to seduce that tentacle critter

162
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:17,189
with my womanly charms
and elephant prowess.

163
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:18,751
Uhh, no way.

164
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:27,775
Uh, what are you doing here,
Tree Trunks?

165
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:32,305
I'm helping you by tempting
this guy with <i>my body</i>.

166
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,236
It's not a <i>guy</i>, Tree Trunks!

167
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,674
It's a Snake Armed Ruby Brain Beast!

168
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,501
Even brain beasts get lonely, Finn!

169
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:42,118
Jake! You were supposed to watch her!

170
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:43,915
She got passed me, man.

171
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:46,712
I tried to stop her,
but she overpowered me.

172
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:48,149
Get her <i>out</i> of here!

173
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,274
Finn, kill it!

174
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:56,196
I can't find it's magic gem weak spot!

175
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,176
Oh, there it is.

176
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,332
I did it! I helped!

177
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:06,598
I'm the sexiest adventurer in the world!

178
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:09,113
Tree Trunks! You're <i>not</i> an adventurer!

179
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:10,699
You nearly got yourself killed,

180
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:11,356
<i>again!</i>

181
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:12,887
Do you wanna die, Tree Trunks?!?

182
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,613
Is that what you think adventurers do?!?

183
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:17,762
Die and make all their friends feel
terrible 'cause they couldn't save you?!?

184
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:20,535
Whoa, man.

185
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:23,402
I'm going home now.

186
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,470
Tree Trunks...

187
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,166
Tree Trunks!

188
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:30,744
Don't follow me.

189
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:33,556
Oh, Finn...

190
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:37,736
You shouldn't yell at cuties that
just wanna help you.

191
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:41,251
Man, I feel horrible.

192
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:43,751
I was only yelling because
I care about her safety.

193
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:46,399
That's what happens when you care
too much, dude.

194
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:49,486
Tree Trunks!

195
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:53,282
Finn, I found the Crystal Gem Apple.

196
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,289
You're the man, Tree Trunks!

197
00:08:57,297 --> 00:09:00,524
Tree Trunks, I'm a huge butt guy
for getting mad at you.

198
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:01,884
I'm a huge fart.

199
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:04,821
I was only upset because I love you and
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

200
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,376
That's precious, Finn.

201
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:10,930
And I'll accept your apology 
if you let me kiss your cheek.

202
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:13,733
I don't know, I…

203
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,358
Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man.

204
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,874
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

205
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:21,991
<i>Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man.</i>

206
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,285
<i>It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. </i>

207
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:28,006
<i>I don't know, I…</i>

208
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,709
A crystal guardian!

209
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:33,100
Tree Trunks, stay out of the
monster battle this time.

210
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:34,787
I don't want you getting hurt.

211
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,849
Alright, I promise I will.

212
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:37,982
Radical!

213
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:39,302
Back off you!

214
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,553
<i>Back off you! </i>

215
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:42,162
Stop copying me!

216
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,436
<i>Stop copying me!</i>

217
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,232
Finn!

218
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:58,651
He's copying everything we do.

219
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:03,565
Hey! It's my butterfly-friend.

220
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,159
That's precious.

221
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:14,834
Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks!

222
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:17,232
<i>Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks! </i>

223
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:23,498
Gem-clam! Let's beat it up while
it's copying Tree Trunks!

224
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:28,427
Crud, this is barf dude.

225
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:32,271
Oh, man, I'm a total moron!

226
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,709
We gotta fight this one Tree Trunks style.

227
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:35,896
I'll get the make up.

228
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:48,865
Hey! Crystal Guardian!

229
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:51,762
Are you okay with Tree Trunks
taking a bite of that apple?

230
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,849
I'm okay with it.

231
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:53,878
<i>I'm okay with it. </i>

232
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,021
And I'm stupid.

233
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:56,036
<i>And I'm stupid. </i>

234
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,638
You heard the guardian, TT.
Bite that thing.

235
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:00,786
Okay!

236
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,956
Whoo! How's it taste, Tree Trunks?

237
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:05,019
Yeah! How is it?
