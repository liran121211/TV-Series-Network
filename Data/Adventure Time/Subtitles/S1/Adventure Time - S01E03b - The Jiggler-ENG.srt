How about you, Jake?

70
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:02,432
Maybe we should go upstairs.

71
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,744
You can have the comfiest spot on the bed.

72
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:06,791
Goodnight.

Where's the little guy?

79
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:27,232
Over there.

80
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:29,826
Hey, pal.

81
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,388
You ready to cut loose?

82
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:32,716
Wake and shake, buddy.

83
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:34,021
Let's do this thing!

84
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:43,253
Slam-a-cow! That fool looks rumped.

85
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:44,628
What do you mean?

86
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:45,729
Well, look at him.

87
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:47,753
He's all limp... and weird.

88
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,104
I bet he just needs some breakfast
after a night of extraordinary jiggling.

89
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:55,228
Hey! Let's combine everything
we can find in the kitchen...

90
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:56,737
and have the Jiggler drink it!

91
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:57,995
That'll wake him up!

92
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,198
And then we can...

93
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:01,378
Get ♪ down! ♪

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,401
He doesn't want to drink that goop, man.

95
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:08,034
Then let's just give him some, uh...
purple whatevers.

96
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,448
You mean the grapes?

97
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:11,198
Yeah. Whatever.

98
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:15,582
Hey! I think he's diggin' it!

99
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,376
That doesn't sound good.

100
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,079
Uh, you think we...

101
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:24,837
...fed the wrong hole?

102
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:28,649
Nah. He just doesn't like purple whatevers.

103
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,158
What we need to do is figure out
what he <i>does </i>like to eat.

104
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:35,422
Here, Jiggler.
What kind of food do you like?

105
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:36,321
Meat?

106
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:37,470
Some banana?

107
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:40,118
This looks like corn...

108
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:41,079
...I think...

109
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:42,681
Uh... hot dog.

110
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,446
Stanley the watermelon.

111
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:49,172
Look! Jake! He likes it!

112
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,048
No way!

113
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:55,977
His favorite food is drawings!

114
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:56,961
Awesome!

115
00:04:57,032 --> 00:04:59,149
Holy fig, that's awesome!

116
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,789
What food are you drawing now?

117
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:03,305
I'm drawing a picture of you.

118
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:04,727
Well, don't feed it me!

119
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:08,540
Come on. Eat him up, Jiggler!

120
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,172
No!

121
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,563
Keep it away! Shoo! Shoo!

122
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:16,523
No!

123
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,734
Alright. Alright. I got it.

124
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,742
Calm down...

125
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:21,609
<i>I'll </i>eat it.

126
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:28,062
Dude! You eating me is just as bad
as the Jiggler eating me.

127
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:30,663
Well... You gonna eat yourself, tough guy?

128
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:33,249
Yes. If that is what must be done.

129
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,171
I taste awesome.

130
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:44,423
Ok. Alright.

131
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:46,853
Now, let's get back to some jiggling!

132
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:47,993
I'll get the tunes!

133
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:51,063
Like this. Yeah!

134
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,883
Come on Jiggler! Wiggle and whistle!

135
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,305
Yeah, Jiggler. Go nuts!

136
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,516
Go nuts like there's bugs on your butts!

137
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:06,483
Jiggler?

138
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:08,991
What the heck? What's wrong with him?

139
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:11,335
Uh... There's nothing wrong with him.

140
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:12,819
We just gotta plug up his holes.

141
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:15,476
See? That worked.

142
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:17,272
Ready to jiggle again, little guy?

143
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:19,546
Oh, man...

144
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:21,826
Quick!

145
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:23,054
We gotta plug those holes!

146
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,389
Jake, hurry!

147
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,756
All I could find was your
glass eye collection!

148
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:29,295
What about your eyepatch collection?

149
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:31,280
Aw, man. They're in <i>mint</i> condition.

150
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:31,999
Jake!!!

151
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:33,170
Alright! Coming!

152
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,374
One... more... patch!

153
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:39,936
Finished.

154
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:42,295
He looks terrible.

155
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,006
Finn, I know you don't want to hear this,

156
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:45,694
but I think we should cut our losses

157
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,680
and bring this fella back
to where we found him.

158
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:48,990
We can't just abandon him.

159
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,490
Look at him, Jake.
He needs us now more than ever.

160
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:54,209
Just need to take better care of you
from now on, right little guy?

161
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:58,178
Jiggler!

162
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:03,432
Finn. Ok...

163
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:06,065
Our pet exploded.

164
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,596
Maybe we can... scrape him up!

165
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,205
And...

166
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:11,972
Bleaurgh!

167
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:14,338
Oh, holy moly!

168
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:16,299
Don't worry, Jiggler. We'll fix you.

169
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:22,314
Let's gather him up, Jake.

170
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,018
He's all over the place...

171
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:25,846
even between the floorboards!

172
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:27,065
And the cupboards!

173
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:28,267
And the galoshes!

174
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:30,510
I wonder... Where's his hiney?

175
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:34,096
Found it! Come here, you!

176
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:34,682
Hey!

177
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,471
Come on. Let's put him back together.

178
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,369
Ok.

179
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,377
Squeeze real hard.

180
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:41,283
He's slipping!

181
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:42,088
Got him!

182
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:47,959
Well, at least he's all in one piece.

183
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:51,881
You think he's dead?

184
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:52,827
No way!

185
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,312
I won't let you die, guy! Not this time.

186
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,030
Finn. Stop it, man. What are you doing?

187
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:04,772
I'm kissing him! What do you think?

188
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:06,444
It's all I could think to do.

189
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:07,928
Just put him down.

190
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,803
He's kissing colors with his dying breath.

191
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:24,815
I think he's trying to tell us something.

192
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:26,957
Finn, this looks like it could be his mom.

193
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,042
We took this child away from
its mama, Jake.

194
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,081
We're kidnappers <i>and</i> murderers!

195
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,097
I just wanted to have fun and jiggle!

196
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:39,441
Look... Chill out, ok?

197
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:40,862
We can fix this.

198
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:41,645
Check it out.

199
00:08:41,924 --> 00:08:44,323
His mom looks like she's out
by Stanley's house...

200
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:45,636
where we found the Jiggler.

201
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:48,283
If we get him back to her,
she'll be able to fix him up!

202
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,533
Then there's no time to spare.

203
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:55,881
Just hold on a little longer, buddy.

204
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:57,721
Did you hear that?

205
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:58,651
Whistling!

206
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,408
<i>Perpendicular!</i> It's the mama!

207
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:11,444
Look! The little guy wants to go home!

208
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:13,366
Well. This is it, buddy.

209
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:15,553
Be well.

210
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:24,139
Hey! Stop that!

211
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,139
I don't understand.

212
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:29,006
That crazy mama almost killed him.

213
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:30,342
He feels cold.

214
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:32,116
What are we supposed to do now, man?

215
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,030
We can't bring him home, or he'll...

216
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:34,882
or he'll...

217
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:38,554
Dang it! Why doesn't she love him?

218
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,374
I love him!

219
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:40,304
You love him!

220
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:41,499
It's not fair!

221
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,140
Finn, wait!

222
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:45,796
Mama's supposed to love baby!

223
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:47,585
She's supposed to <i>love</i> baby!

224
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,264
Huh?!?

225
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:52,584
Oh, man!

226
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,210
It's yours, idiot!

227
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:58,061
Don't you recognize your own baby?

228
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:58,679
Finn!

229
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,819
I figured it out, dude.

230
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:01,983
It's the juice.

231
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:05,140
The Jiggler needs to smell like
its mama's juice.

232
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:07,187
That's how wild animals know
what’s going on...

233
00:10:07,194 --> 00:10:09,249
and this guy right here is all drained out.

234
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,226
We gotta toss it in the soup, brother.

235
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:12,843
Alright. Ok.

236
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:15,374
I loved you, baby. I hope you know that.

237
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:20,726
Word to your motheeeerrrrr!

238
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:36,469
I'll never kidnap again.

239
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,578
You said it!

240
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:39,195
...That was a nightmare.
