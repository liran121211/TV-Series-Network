185
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,028
bloobalooby!

186
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,031
Hmm?

187
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,831
Well, being 18 is
all plopdumps and waggle-sags.

188
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,998
I never really get to act
like a kid.

189
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,008
But it's okay, really.

190
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,101
My people need me,
and that comes first.

191
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,975
Yeah.

192
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,276
The first thing we need
is more candyflesh

193
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,941
to increase my biomass.

194
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,417
But I need my lab equipment
to engineer it.

195
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,477
PEPPERMINT BUTLER:
Not necessarily, m'lady.

196
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:47,724
[gasps]

197
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,252
Oh, thank you!
Thank you all!

198
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,595
Okay, next we need
a bonding agent.

199
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,329
Princess, I think
I can help.

200
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,140
Finished!

201
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,842
There's one last
thing we need.

202
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,782
Only the heat from a whopping
love-hug

203
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,980
can catalyze
the re-agifying process.

204
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,217
Are you ready,
Princess?

205
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,990
Yes, Finn, but first,
I just want to say

206
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,361
how much fun I've had hanging
out with you.

207
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,399
Me too!

208
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,831
And I...

209
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,528
I wish I could stay

210
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,571
like this
with you, but...

211
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,503
I...
I know, Princess.

212
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,673
'Scuse me, Finn.

213
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,011
Yo, Earl!

214
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,847
EARL: What?!

215
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,353
Hey! You're fired,
ya butt!

216
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,856
[screams]

217
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,688
[ muttering ]

218
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,888
I'm so glad
everything's back to normal.

219
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,727
Thanks for all your help,
Finn.

220
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,426
Oh! You're welcome.

221
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,865
But, um...

222
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,027
What is it, Finn?

223
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,367
Well, do you, uh...

224
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,431
do you want to hug some more?

225
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,840
[laughs]
What? Finn, you silly.

226
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,675
That was like five years ago.

227
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,681
You really got to move on.

228
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:19,082
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Sorry.

229
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,144
Such a silly boy.

230
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,156
[sighs]

231
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,158
[telephone rings]

232
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,818
Hello.

233
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,486
Hey, man.
What's the status?

234
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,996
Bad news, man.

235
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,998
I...
I got dumped.

236
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,000
Aw, I'm sorry, Finn.

237
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,935
But look, man, let me share
with you a little secret

238
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,269
on how to win the heart
of a princess.

239
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,934
It's not easy, but you have
to be persistent.

240
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,638
You might have
to defeat a demon lord

241
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,680
and warp through
several worlds,

242
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,478
but once you do, you
walk up the wizard stairs

243
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,711
and produce your magic key
you got in the water world

244
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,720
and unlock
the chamber door.

245
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,552
Then walk right up
to the princess

246
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,854
and you give her
a smooch.

247
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,359
[ beep]
Yes!

248
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,827
Does that make sense?

249
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,693
Yeah, man.
I see what you're saying.

250
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,357
Thanks, Jake.

251
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,957
Mm-hmm.

252
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,026

253
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,628
