180
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,884
I don't yet know
what this means...

181
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,766
As you can see, my skin is
beginning to turn blue,

182
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,688
my body temperature has
been lowering

183
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,060
at a supernatural rate,

184
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,110
to what is now
about 30 degrees celsius.

185
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,186
I don't know
when it will end.

186
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,147
I'm really scared...

187
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,699
I know my mind is changing,

188
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,995
but I'm already too far gone
to know what to do.

189
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,789
I want people to know
that if I do things,

190
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,665
if -- if I do things
that hurt anyone,

191
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,667
please, please forgive me!

192
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,999
Just watch over me
until I can find my way

193
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,129
out of this labyrinth
in my brain

194
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,381
and regain my sanity!

195
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,259
And then maybe Betty,
my princess...

196
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,931
maybe you will love me again.

197
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,602

Please love me again, Betty!

[SNIFFLES]
Now you know my secret!

201
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,230
You know...

202
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,187
that I used to wear glasses!

[CRYING]

204
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,276
Maybe kidnapping Wildberry
Princess will cheer me up.

205
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,156
Wait, Ice King.

206
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,363

Here, Ice King.

210
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,208
What's this?
You're giving me a gift?

211
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,509
No!
It's...

212
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,302
Well, these belong to you.

213
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,846
But it's not even
my birthday!

214
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,596
Oh, this is so exciting!
Video tapes!

215
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,722
You know, I had a bunch
of these once,

216
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,304
but I threw them away.

217
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,684
This is great, Finn.
Thank you.

218
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,141
It's from me, too.

219
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,603
Oh, I have presents
for you guys, too!

220
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,403
Here, it's a small pine tree.

221
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,607
I chopped it down
in one fell swoop.

222
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,236
And this is for you.

223
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,239
Uh, thanks.

224
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,911
Oh, isn't this fun?

225
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,411
We're exchanging presents.
We're wearing silly clothes.

226
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,367
There's snow everywhere.

227

229
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,422
How about once a year?

Okay.
