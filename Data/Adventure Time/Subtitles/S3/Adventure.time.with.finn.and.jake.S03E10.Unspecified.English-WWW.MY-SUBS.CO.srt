Okay, here's that lock of Bubblegum's hair you love so much.

205
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:18,913
Oh, you.

206
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,480
Ugh, yeesh.

207
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:22,910
And here's Jake's blankie.

208
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,210
Here's your controller, Beemo.

209
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,210
Yippie kiyiyay!

210
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,946
Marceline, here's your... rock shirt.

211
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:30,956
Hey, that's not-

212
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:31,100
It's mine! That's mine...
Hey, that's not-

213
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,456
It's mine! That's mine...

214
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:35,446
You... kept the shirt I gave you.

215
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:39,026
Yeah... It, uh... means a lot to me.

216
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:40,180
But you never wore it.

217
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,180
Dude, I wear it all the time!

218
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:44,226
As pajamas.

219
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,886
Wait. If that's Bubblegum's shirt, what are you missing, Marceline?

220
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,910
...Wait a second.

221
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:50,956
Wait a second!
...Wait a second.

222
00:10:50,956 --> 00:10:52,276
Wait a second!

223
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,466
You don't have a thing. You just wanted to hang out with us.

224
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:56,466
No I didn't.

225
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,223
No way, you're caught!

226
00:10:58,223 --> 00:10:59,666
I figured you out.

227
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,666
Ha ha ha ha ha.
