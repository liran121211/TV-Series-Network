This is part of my plan.

184
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,949
Oh! Ha ha!

185
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,626
Then I shall play along,
wise giant.

186
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,749
How are we to trust you?

187
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,751
Well... here -- look!
I brought y'all a prisoner.

188
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,457
It's their leader.

189
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,463
May you rot in tartarus!

190
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,297
May your skin boil
and eyes burst into flames

191
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,303
forever in a pit!

192
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,261
[tink!]

193
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,599
Traitor!

194
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:58,654
So, do you guys have,
like, a leader or something?

195
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,732
[all murmuring "Mildwin"]

196
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,488
Mildwin!

197
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,241
I'm Mildwin,
leader of the Moldos.

198
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,540
Oh. Uh...
hmm.

199
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,741
[grunts]

200
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,577
Nice to meet you,
your highness.

201
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,253
I'm not a king.

202
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,547
I was democratically elected.

203
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,091
[laughs]
That's adorable.

204
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,090
Now, Finn!
Yah! Hunh! Hyah!

205
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,046
MOLDOS:
Protect the elected official!

206
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,723
[Panting]

207
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,095
PETE:
Well-played, oh, giant.

208
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,677
You have the cunning of Odysseus.

209
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,353
Pete, j-just stop winking.

210
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,602
Yo! Yah! Yah!

211
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,149
Hyoh! Hyoh! Yah!

212
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,646
Shh!

213
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,774
[Panting]

214
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,900
Hup-hup!

215
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,697
Ignore... this!

216
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,694
[chomp! chomp! chomp!]

217
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,116
Hmm?

218
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,943
This tastes delicious!

219
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,074
[chomp!]

220
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,746
Aah! Aah! Aah!

221
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,448
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

222
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,954
[grunting]

223
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,957
What did you do to me?!

224
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,288
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

225
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,872
- Uh...
- Aaaaaaaah!

226
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,423
Uh... uhhh...

227
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,125
Come on, you guys.
Knock it off.

228
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,300
[Hisses]

229
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,003
The Moldos got a taste
for you now.

230
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,838
[whimpering]

231
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,423
Gotta do something!

232
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,760
Where can I find ways to solve
problems in a library?

233
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:12,844
Books?

234
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,726
Aah!

235
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,978
Books! Books! Books!

236
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:18,980
Ehhhhh!

237
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,278
[panting]
Huh?

238
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,319
[Chomp! chomp!]

239
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,739
What you nibbling me for?

240
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,784
This sweaty stuff tastes
amazing!

241
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,452
A-mazing!

242
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,904
Hmm.

243
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,864
Tastier than battle beast fur.

244
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,949
Yes!

245
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,876
Hey, Mildwin.

246
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,631
- Mildwin!
- What?

247
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,054
I bring a peace offering
from the Pagelings.

248
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,130
Hmm?

249
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,431
[sniffs]

250
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,930
[Moldos talking indistinctly]

251
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,606
Finn, what's happening?

252
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,058
Hang on, buddy.

253
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,188
Paper Pete?

254
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,644
Giant!

255
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,071
Have you wiped out
the Moldo horde?

256
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,773
No, man.

257
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,324
The war's over.

258
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,367
Mildwin, you can keep
my shirt

259
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,242
if you don't attack their
library books.

260
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,198
Agreed, beast.

261
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,661
This filthy garb will feed
my people for generations.

262
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,497
And in 40 years,
you can have my shorts.

263
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,173
Sound good, Pete?

264
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,718
It will suffice.

265
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,669
Sound good, Jake?

266
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,753
[grunting]

267
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,388
Yaaaaaaaaaah!

268
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,260
[snap!]

269
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,342
What -- what the hecks, man?!

270
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,677
What'd you do to me?!

271
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,808
Look, man!
Moldos and Pagelings are real!

272
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,767
Wha-- who cares, man?!
I'm outta here!

273
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,023
Did you finish your
Rainicorn book?

274
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,696
Ugh. I was reading
the same paragraph

275
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,865
over and over
for like 11 minutes.

276
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,112
I guess I'm gonna give up
on learning

277
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,569
everything
about Rainicorn history.

278
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,653
Don't tell Lady.

279
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,240
Oh. What about, uh, relating
to your mixed-species kids?

280
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,917
Eh, I'll just fake it.

281
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:00,994
Oh.

282
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,671
Well... hey, man,
I think I see some...

283
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,293
um... sun people

284
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,920
in trouble on the sun
over there.

285
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,877
- You making that up?
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,928
Yeah! Let's do it!

00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,382
