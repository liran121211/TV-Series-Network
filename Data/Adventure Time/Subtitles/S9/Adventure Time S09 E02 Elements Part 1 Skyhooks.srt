ALL: S'more!

183
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:53,667
Stay back, S'more!

184
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:55,165
JAKE: Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!

185
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,531
(GROWLS) (LAUGHS) Whoa, dudes.

186
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,708
I was just playin'.

187
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:04,212
ALL: What?! Marceline!

188
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:07,646
(GIGGLES) No, it's Marshmaline...

189
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:09,550
the Campfire Queen.

190
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:10,815

Marsh... Marshmi... Marshman... My...

194
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,823
Would you like to hear a song?

195
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:19,327
I've written just the ditty
that'll cheer up anyone

196
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:21,829
that's overwhelmed with
work or responsibility.

197
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,832
Yay! I love Marshmaline songs!

198
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,703
No time for tunes. Do you
know where Bonnie is?

199
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:30,836
Of course! Follow me.

200

(HUMMING ENDS)

203
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:48,323
Marshy... where's PB?

204
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:50,656
She's everywhere.

205
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:54,024
(RUMBLING)

206
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:57,194
Good tidings to you, my friends.

Yahoo!

209
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:02,033
What... what happened to you?

210
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:03,705
Oh, this? (GIGGLES)

211
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:06,707
I've become what I was
always meant to become...

212
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,745
A pure candy elemental.

213
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:11,746

(BELCHES) 'Scuse me.

216
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:20,021
What about Tree Trunks and Lemongrab

217
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:21,955
and Marceline and everyone else?

218
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:24,093
I fixed 'em, obviously.

219
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:26,426
Fixed 'em? But they're your friends!

220
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:29,131
Those aren't mutually
exclusive concepts.

221
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:30,895
That means it's fine.

222
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:32,964
No, it's<i> not</i> fine.

223
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:34,403
Don't fret.

224
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:36,704
I can fix you, too.

(SQUISHING)

226
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,243
Aah! Aah! Aah!

227
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:43,076
I can feel my bones turning gummy!

228
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:44,246
Me, too!

229
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:45,647
We gotta get out of here before...

230
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:46,882
Oof! Hugs!

231
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:48,746
I'm connected to all candy

232
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:50,751
throughout all the galaxies.

233
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:55,423
Once you're candy, you'll
be part of me, too!

234
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:58,057
No! That plan sucks!

235
00:09:58,058 --> 00:09:59,493
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Oh, my gosh!

236
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:01,663
Aah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

237
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:03,896
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Ow!

Ice King?

240
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:09,936
Hold on to me, bro!

241
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:11,773
No!

242
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:14,607
Wait, we forgot... BMO!

243
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:17,675
Goodbye, boys! It's better this way!

247
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:26,284
They have nowhere else to go.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

249
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,955
Yah! Ooh!

(GROANS)

251
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:37,298
Are we in...

252
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:38,963
Cloud Kingdom.

253
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:40,368
Looks like we got away

254
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:42,534
before the candy curse became permanent.

255
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:46,076
That's right. My skyhooks saved the day.

256
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:47,808
Thanks for getting us
out of there, Simon.

257
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:52,180
Aw, I can't take all the credit.
It's all thanks to my skyhooks.

258
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:54,646
Hey, why are you even up here?

259
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:58,384
We live here now, me and the skyhooks.

260
00:10:58,385 --> 00:11:01,788
Finn, you gotta see this.

00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:05,223
(GASPS)

262
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:06,895
