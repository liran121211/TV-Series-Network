Wenk?

183
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:21,163
The date? Uh, yeah, it went great.

184
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:22,967
I don't know about a
second date, though.

185
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,538
I don't wanna be that guy

186
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,537
who just hangs out with his
girlfriend all the time

187
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:27,949
and doesn't see his friends.

188
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,877
Man, I wanna be that guy so bad.

189
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,276
(WHOOSH)

190
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:35,678
Hey, I was just talking
about you to my penguin.

191
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,181
Have you met Gunter?

192
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,646
Yes. I kidnapped him that one time.

193
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,015
Look, Simon... I mean, Ice King.

194
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:45,053
Yeah, who's this Simon guy
you keep yakking about?

195
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:46,824
Should I be jealous?

196
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:49,153
He's somebody I knew a long time ago.

197
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,896
Hey, you still into bird watching?

198
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,728
Watch this.

199
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:54,995
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) Mmm... zow!

200
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:57,000
- (BIRDS CHIRPING)
- (LAUGHS) Amazing!

201
00:08:57,001 --> 00:09:00,872
- (LAUGHS)
- Such beautiful birds!

202
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,904
They're all for you, Ice King.

203
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:05,243
Woof. What a bust.

204
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,012
These are some low-grade fairies.

205
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:10,745
My magic battery is going to su...

206
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:13,149
Who's this dancing with the I.K.?

207
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,583
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

208
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:16,887
Bird friend! (LAUGHS)

209
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,357
How delightful.

210
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,593
(LAUGHING)

211
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,094
Ha! (SIGHS)

212
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,827
Huh? Where did the weird lady go?

213
00:09:25,828 --> 00:09:28,431
Uh... well, when you weren't looking,

214
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:30,534
her... her mom showed
up and told her that

215
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:33,006
her old boyfriend wanted
to be with her again,

216
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:35,237
and they ran off together. The end.

217
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:36,672
Her mom?

218
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:38,619
Well, I gotta go.

219
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,230
I almost forgot!

220
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:43,791
Surprise!

221
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,288
(CRYING, CHEWING)

222
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,289
(GROANS)

223
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,092
I wonder if my roomie has any more

224
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:56,925
of these soothing doughnuts.

225
00:09:56,926 --> 00:09:59,297
Only one way to find out!

226
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,267
♪♪

227
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:07,438
PATIENCE: Elemental, elemental.

228
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,308
Stand, do not sit.

229
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,643
Cool.

230
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,044
Elemental, Elemental.

231
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:17,482
Can not quit.

232
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,814
Weird Lady!

233
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:21,486
Blast him!

234
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,487
(HUMMING)

235
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:24,789
Eee.

236
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,324
(ZAPS)

237
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,256
Then everything went nuts.

238
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:31,396
There was all this light and noise.

239
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,133
I grabbed as many penguins
as I could... one.

240
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,834
But now that you're here,

241
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:39,005
we can go back and save Weird Lady.

242
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,236
Sounds like we got our first lead.

243
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:44,560
All we needed was... a little patience.
