(YELLS)

188
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:18,846
Fire Kingdom rules!

189
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:21,549
That was messed up and
not who you really are.

190
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,384
Aah!

191
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,285
(GRUNTS) (GROANS)

192
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:26,619
Stop talking to me like we're friends!

193
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,896
The only friend I have is violence,

194
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:31,557
and the only thing we do
when we hang is fight.

195
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:32,961
(GROWLS)

196
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:34,325
Finn, wait!

197
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:36,965
Flame Princess <i>is</i> the dragon!

198
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,066
- Ah! Ah! Ah!
- I'm being arrowed!

199
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:41,536
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

200
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:42,869
Wenk.

201
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,635
Gunter, you saved me!

202
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:48,243
Wenk. Wenk. Wenk.

203
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,176
Wenk!

204
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:52,580
I know you won't hurt me, Gunter.

205
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,045
Wenk. Wenk. Wenk.

206
00:08:54,046 --> 00:08:57,251
Oh, no! I'm too trusting!

207
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,585
Finn, I want to leave! Wrap that up.

208
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:01,556
Give it!

209
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:02,689
(ROARS)

210
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,892
No! I have to save Jake.

211
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:07,094
Phoebe. Stop.

212
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:08,263
(GULPS)

213
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:10,064
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

214
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:12,266
Aaaaaah!

215
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,535
Hyah!

216
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,006
Aah!

217
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,436
I'm gonna ruin your universe.

218
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:19,874
(GRUNTS)

219
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,443
(ROARS)

220
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:22,744
Aah!

221
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:26,615
Honestly, I could still see
those two working out.

222
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:29,617
Oh, come on.

223
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:31,050
Ugh!

224
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:34,454
No one touches my charm!

225
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:35,788
Hey.

226
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,091
Hey.

227
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:38,893
Hey!

228
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:40,458
- Wenk.
- This is terrible.

229
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:42,463
Nobody's paying attention to me.

230
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:47,635
Everyone just stop fighting!

231
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:50,805
What's wrong with you?

232
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:53,939
Why can't you be more like
those nice, boring losers

233
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,143
in the Candy Kingdom?

234
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,544
With their little faces and songs?

235
00:09:57,545 --> 00:09:59,214
Or like me?

236
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,928
Why isn't everyone more like me?

237
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,249
Kill her.

238
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,384
No, she's right.

239
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:08,456
We must stop senselessly
attacking each other

240
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:11,126
and start senselessly attacking

241
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:14,228
those disgusting nerds
in the Candy Kingdom!

242
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:16,498
(ALL SHOUTING)

243
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:18,266
Clutch.

244
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:21,168
That's a huge extrapolation
from what I said.

245
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:24,773
ALL: Smash the nerds! Smash the nerds!

246
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:26,804
Smash the nerds!

247
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:32,081
(ALL SHOUTING)

248
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:39,161
Surely, this is the end of all things.

249
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:41,404
Gunter.

250
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:43,114
Finn!

251
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:44,891
Wyatt?
