Take me, Slime Princess!

189
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:02,358
Huh! Hold onto me.

190
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:05,664
This place really is supes comfy.

191
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:07,528
(GRUNTING)

192
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,533
Yoink.

193
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:12,636
Oh, I'm starting to turn.

194
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,169
Pull us out, Jake.

195
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,204
In a minute.

196
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:16,278
What?!

197
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:21,774
It's like being in a
warm bath full of snot.

198
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:27,085
Aah! We're trapped!

199
00:09:27,086 --> 00:09:29,086
It'll work out somehow.

200
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,020
(GASPS) Jake, no! Fight the slime!

201
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,924
I'm having the slime of my life.

202
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:37,027
(CHUCKLES)

203
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:38,299
Jake.

204
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:42,533
I may as well give in to it.

205
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:44,787
Maybe Simon will save Ooo.

206
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:49,039
This isn't an uplifting underdog ending.

207
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,583
You're still here?

208
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,210
I'm not assimilating.

209
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:53,580
And no one can see my cool outfit

210
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,309
through all this lumpin's slime.

211
00:09:56,415 --> 00:09:58,415
(GROANS)

212
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:02,587
<i>Looks like LSP is too much of a
killjoy for our Slime Queen!</i>

213
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:07,289
<i>She's gonna be rejected!</i>

214
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,153
Aah!

215
00:10:10,596 --> 00:10:12,227
(BOTH GROAN)

216
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:15,031
<i>Em-Em-Em-Embarrassing!</i>

217
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,693
<i>Y'all are bounced.</i>

218
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,595
Jerks.

219
00:10:19,304 --> 00:10:22,474
I got the jewel, but I lost Jake.

220
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:24,106
(WARBLES)

221
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:26,110
You're not a Slime person?

222
00:10:26,111 --> 00:10:28,212
No, I totally faked it.

223
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:29,714
I just saw this lumpalicious party,

224
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:32,315
and I was like, "These are my people!"

225
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:35,587
But even though I shoplifted
this super-cool outfit,

226
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,119
I still didn't fit in.

227
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,255
I guess I don't fit in... anywhere!

228
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:41,259
(CRYING)

229
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,660
Jake could fit in anywhere.

230
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:45,102
Whatever happened, he was always like,

231
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,977
"It'll work out."

232
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:50,893
Stop being so selfish, Finn!
I'm the one hurting here!

233
00:10:50,894 --> 00:10:53,670
You don't even know what
it's like to be an underdog.

234
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:56,673
You and Jake always win... Always!

235
00:10:56,674 --> 00:10:58,943
You're right, LSP. We do.

236
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:02,418
Don't worry, Jake! I vow
to get you back in shape.

237
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:03,645
(GASPS)

238
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:06,317
Oh, my Glob, this is it!

239
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:07,619
The crowd-pleasing climax

240
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,420
where the beautiful
underdog gets the hunk.

241
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,186
Rom-com style!
