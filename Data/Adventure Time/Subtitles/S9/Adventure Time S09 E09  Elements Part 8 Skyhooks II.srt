Oh! Hello, Jake.

183
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:55,478
Uh, did you recently get a haircut?

184
00:08:55,479 --> 00:09:00,317
Unnnh. Lumps.

185
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:01,791
Oh, LSP.

186
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:05,761
Please be careful with yourself.

187
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:18,670
Ha-ha, fine, I guess.

188
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:20,706
Yeah, that's all of them!

189
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:23,109
(GROANS)

190
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,925
LSP!

191
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:32,884
(WEAKLY) I'm a hero.

192
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,728
Whoops.

193
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:42,429
You did it.

194
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,165
She did it!

195
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,066
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

196
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,936
Uh, I'd like to date you, LSP.

197
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:51,937
Thank you, Starchy.

198
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,542
(COUGHING)

199
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:59,846
Wait, where... Up here.

200
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:03,848
(CLICKS TONGUE) You really donked up.

201
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:07,687
Finn? Jake?

202
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:10,889
Finn!

203
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:14,562
Oh, my gosh!

204
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:16,563
Come here.

205
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:18,365
- What?
- Over here.

206
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,799
Hey, buddy.

207
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,739
Jake? Are you okay?

208
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,240
Yeah... (CHUCKLES)

209
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:28,911
You know, everything looks
different after a long trip.

210
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:34,248
You and I can fix whatever
this is together, whenever.

211
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:35,749
Fix what now?

212
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:38,204
I was really scared when you left.

213
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,373
You're my best brother.



215
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,232
I love you.
