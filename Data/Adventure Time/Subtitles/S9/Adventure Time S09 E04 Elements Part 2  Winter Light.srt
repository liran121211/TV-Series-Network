Aah!

186
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:01,817
Weird lady!

187
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:03,958
Raa! (DISHES SHATTER)

(GRUNTING)

189
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,997
Best-friends gang, retreat!

190
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:17,211
Ice King's ghosting,
man. We gotta leave!

191
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:20,479
Everyone leaves except me.

192
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
I remember father made
me stay at the table

193
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:24,152
until all the eggs were eaten.

194
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:27,144
Patience, let Jake go!

195
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:30,347
Jake is now part of my Ice Dominion.

196
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:32,274
He'll never leave here again.

197
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,693
Well, that sucks, and I hate it.

198
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,491
I'm just gonna take him anyway.

199
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:39,331
(SIGHS) Whatever.

200
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,016
Achoos Goose.

201
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:44,628
The goose... is loose.

202
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:47,967
We've lost another friend, Achoos Goose.

203
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:50,974
There's no point in having friends

204
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:55,907
because everything will... ends.

205
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,650
My mystic soup is great
for combating ice magic.

206
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:03,222
You sure put a magical
amount of pepper in it.

207
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:05,823
Nothing's changed since
we got you out of there.

208
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:08,494
I guess Patience doesn't need
your magic to sustain it.

209
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:12,095
Yeah, I feel drained
like a dirty bathtub.

210
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:13,698
Jake, how are you feeling?

211
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
This chicken soup does nothing

212
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:17,702
to warm the coldness of my heart.

213
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:20,574
- Are you serious?
- Just kidding!

214
00:10:22,876 --> 00:10:25,246
Man, there's got to be
something we can do

215
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:26,745
about Patience's spell.

216
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:30,349
You know, ancient magic
was actually my major.

217
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,780
And there is one artifact

218
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:33,355
that could potentially help us...

219
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,888
A book called "The Enchiridion."

220
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,519
With that, I could formulate
a counter-spell, and...

221
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:41,265
We can't help you there.
We blew that thing up.

222
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,791
Uh, actually, I might have grabbed

223
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:46,297
another Enchiridion from
Farmworld Dimension.

224
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:47,529
(GASPS)

225
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:49,934
This biz is crazy powerful, though.

226
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:53,939
Well, I'm a little crazy
now, so I'm willing to try.
