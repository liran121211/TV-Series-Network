Don't touch my brother!

186
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:44,268
A pea-shooter?

187
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,841
The juice!

188
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:52,443
Nooooo!

189
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,049
[LAUGHS] Hey! Where's the party?

190
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,517
[GOOFY LAUGHTER]

191
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:01,185
[SIGHS] What a mess.

192
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:06,757
But they do seem happier now...
So unburdened and pliable.

193
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:10,862
You, the crunchy ball, dance for me.

194
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:14,065
Sure.

195
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:15,533
Come on, lady.

196
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:17,268
Do the crunchy dance.

197
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:18,669
Oh, Crunchy.

198
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,005
Sure, I'll dance with my candy people.

199
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:23,742
Yay for the lady!

200
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:26,011
Call me... Princess.

201
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:27,711
ALL: Hurrah!

202
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,416
Whoa, for real?

203
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,717
Like I said, families are tricky.

204
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:36,888
[GASPS]

205
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,624
BMO! Where did you get this cup?

206
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,560
From that guy! The guy on the cup!

207
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:45,590
The guy who's face is
on the cup... that guy!
