Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

188
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:37,997
Bird thoughts!

189
00:08:37,998 --> 00:08:40,065
Perches, birdseed, hooting!

190
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,360
It's not working!

191
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:44,374
That weird eye cloud again.

192
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:47,506
This fall's taking longer
than I thought it would.

193
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:51,422
I wish I had a game to pass the time
while we're plunging to our death.

194
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:53,424
Or, like, a puzzle or something.

195
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:58,116
A puzzle.

196
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,190
So what if I put this here?

197
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,626
Um...

198
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:10,762
â™ªâ™ª

199
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:18,897
Uh, who are you?

200
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:22,875
Okay, you're some kind
of nightmare princess.

201
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:25,343
But where are we?

202
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:28,280
We're dead. I knew it.

203
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:30,249
I'm guessing we're still
asleep on the boat.

204
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,784
I think she entered our nightmares

205
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:34,720
and mashed them up in order
to communicate with us.

206
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,479
What do you want to tell us?

207
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,984
Banana?

208
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:41,003
(GASPS)

209
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:43,312
She wants to hear my banana story!

210
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,034
(ALL GASP)

211
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,436
She's harvesting our mind-fruits!

212
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:57,275
Wait, do you just want us
to give you some bananas?

213
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,579
Well, there's loads on our boat.
You can take as many as you...

214
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,382
No, Finn! You have to negotiate first.

215
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:05,484
We won't trade them for anything less

216
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:08,453
than something pretty and/or cool.

217
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,493
Enjoy those bananas!

218
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:18,497
Pretty!

219
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:20,633
What is this, like, nightmare juice?

220
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:22,152
Let's drink it!

221
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:29,240
(YAWNS) Hey, look how
close to home we are.

222
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:34,572
Land ho!

223
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:36,749
Hm.

224
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:38,409
Mm-hmm.

225
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:40,395
Yep.

226
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:42,321
Ooh, la-la.

227
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,089
How's it look, BMO?

228
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,121
Like a dream.

229
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:49,122
