Hey, there's that cloud again.

190
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:51,115
Hey, what's behind that door, huh?

191
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:52,855
It's what everybody's been wondering.

192
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:54,784
Yeah, maybe it's our way out of here.

193
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:57,422
What's behind the door?

194
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,391
It's...

195
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:02,124
a cloud restroom.

196
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,629
If you'll excuse me for a minute.

197
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,794
Don't look.

198
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:08,133
There's a door.

199
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:10,466
I don't care! Don't
look in this direction!

200
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:15,472
It makes me feel like you can
hear my most private business.

201
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:17,975
(URINATING)

202
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:19,444
(GROWLS)

203
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:21,913
Hey, Jake! It's not a toilet.

204
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:23,714
It's some kind of angler lard!

205
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:26,086
I don't care what it is, I got to go.

206
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:29,312
Wah! What the...?

207
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:31,465
Hey, lard! Lard!

208
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:33,509
Go away!

209
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:41,164
Hold on, Jake.

210
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:43,907
It's Super Bespoke Jacket Guy!

211
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:49,475
Since when is it such a
hassle just to take a whiz?!

212
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:57,484
Hey, lard, do you mind
if I call you Cloudy?

213
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:01,353
Hey, Cloudy, what do you want
to eat a smelly old dog for?

214
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,486
Thanks.

215
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,527
Get a whiff of this.

216
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:06,424
- (INHALES DEEPLY)
- You like that?

217
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:08,994
This is a bespoke Ice King jacket.

218
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,465
You got his ancient man scent?

219
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,695
(SNORTS)

220
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:14,498
Go get him, boy!

221
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:17,364
Find the Ice King!

222
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:19,434
Are you being digested in there?

223
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,273
Just a little.

224
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:22,541
Hmph.

225
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,874
'Scuse me. Ouch!

226
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,546
Thanks for not digesting me.

227
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:30,885
You know, the way I see it,
all this elemental stuff

228
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,383
would have happened no matter what.

229
00:09:32,384 --> 00:09:34,685
We're actually lucky
we were out of town.

230
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:37,625
Nothing happened to us, so now
we have a chance to fix it.

231
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:40,155
Thanks, Jake, that's kind of comforting.

232
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:42,769
I thought of it in the bathroom.

233
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:47,365
Hey, guys! Guess who's back.

234
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:49,207
Hmm, did you guys leave or something?

235
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,835
(CHUCKLES) It's always
good to see my bros.

236
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:54,005
Ew.

237
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,476
This is our new friend Cloudy.

238
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:57,405
He really wanted to meet you.

239
00:09:57,927 --> 00:09:59,871
How did you like your
first taste of Ice King?

240
00:10:00,913 --> 00:10:02,997
It wasn't that great.

241
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:05,647
The dog was better tasting, actually.

242
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,515
Although a little mangy.

243
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:09,083
A food critic.

244
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:10,828
Maybe this is what you want, Cloudy!

245
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:11,923
Go get it!

246
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:13,724
Mmm!

247
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,026
Dog. Dog. Dog.

248
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:16,096
Oh, there you are.

249
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:17,765
I made a real breakthrough.

250
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,095
I think I've figured out

251
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:21,668
exactly what we need
to do to repair Ooo.

252
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:24,734
We can use the Enchiridion

253
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:26,875
to create an elemental counter-spell.

254
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,605
First, we just need to retrieve
the three royal jewels

255
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:31,949
from the crowns of the
elemental princesses.

256
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,044
Easy.

257
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:34,112
That's great!

258
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:35,545
Finally a legit plan.

259
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:37,618
Thanks for making me chill, Jake.

260
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:38,826
That really helped me out.

261
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:43,722
Hey, did you guys get haircuts?

262
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,041
Without me?
