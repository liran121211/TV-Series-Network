00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,100
Credits and bs

2
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,687
I remember you.

3
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,985
Okay, Gunther.
You ready for the show to begin?

4
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,522
One, two, three...

5
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:44,544
Gunther, why did you Gunt my fries?

6
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,633
I gunted them, and they were mine.

7
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:50,747
What kind of Gunt Gunts
his Gunther's fries?

8
00:00:50,782 --> 00:00:53,604
And doesn't even Gunt him in the eyes.

9
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:55,796
Gunther there were tears there.

10
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:58,397
If you Gunted them would you even care?

11
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:01,691
Gunther, do you even love me?

12
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:04,458
It's rethorical, Gunther.

13
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:07,178
Marceline's songs are so good.

14
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,839
Maybe I can get Marceline to
write a song with me.

15
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:14,814
Man, if she helped me
write a song like that,

16
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,736
I'd be crushing it non stop
with the princesses.

17
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:19,174
Oh, yeah!

18
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:24,238
Gunther, you cute little dummie.

19
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:26,495
You know, Gunther?

20
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,079
My song is gonna need some
dope lyrics to lure the honeys in.

21
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,001
Jay T. Dawgzone always says

22
00:01:36,036 --> 00:01:39,607
ladies are drawn to bros
with tortured pasts.

23
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:42,092
And I got a way tortured past.

24
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:43,135
I think.

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,283
I don't really... re...

26
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:47,790
Quickly, Gunther.

27
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:50,550
To the "the past room".

28
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,488
Oh, yes.

29
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,841
Lot of emotionally powerful
stuff in here.

30
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:10,950
It's still wet with tears.

31
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:13,554
I'll take some of this for
lyrical inspiration.

32
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,696
So, where's Marceline living this days?

33
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:19,481
A cave?

34
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:24,396
Well, well, well.

35
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,094
Looks like Ice king is up to bad biscuits brother.

36
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,556
Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro.

37
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:34,230
Ice king, you make our job too easy.

38
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:35,777
You ready to roll on this fool?

39
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:37,023
Do the roll!

40
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,230
Hello? Anybody home?

41
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:47,577
No.

42
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:53,223
What are you doing here?
I told you not to come around me.

43
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:57,358
Yeah, I know. But I was hoping you
could help me write a song.

44
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,229
One that could help me get
some princess action.

45
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,561
I'm not gonna help you
pick up on chicks!

46
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:03,562
Come on!

47
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:05,499
We can be a prog rock duo!

48
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,317
I'll even split the fans with you.

49
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,034
I get the princesses and you get...

50
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,351
whatever it is you're into.

51
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:12,651
Sounds good, yeah, I think it does.

52
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,968
Hey, get out of here!

53
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:27,638
Wait, just let me play you
what I've written so far.

54
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,587
Oh, dang it, tangles in the cord.

55
00:03:33,142 --> 00:03:35,897
Sometimes this happens
when you fly with it.

56
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:37,484
Tangles are hard.

57
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:42,366
Oh geez, no.

58
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:43,459
Oh, no.

59
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:45,118
Ice kings' in trouble.

60
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,369
Hey you know what?
I'll just hum it for you.

61
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:53,904
Is that good?

62
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:56,068
Ice king!

63
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:56,934
Whaaa?

64
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,513
Oh, you got him.

65
00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:00,209
Nice job, Marceline.

66
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:05,325
Your constant harrasement of the
female gender makes me sick.

67
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:09,360
No, he can stay.

68
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:10,159
What?

69
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:11,374
Yeah, what?

70
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,071
It's all right, we're working
on a song together.

71
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:16,664
You don't want us to...

72
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:17,960
for you?

73
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:19,642
No, it's okay, you guys can go.

74
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,159
Okay...

75
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,484
Well I guess we'll see you, then.

76
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:30,294
- Bye.
- Bye.

77
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:35,182
You know? I kind of like being
tied up in this cords.

78
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:37,090
Kind of fruity.

79
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:43,685
So, what kind of song are we playing?

80
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:46,561
Oh, I brought these for some inspiration.

81
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:49,283
I'll just use this to work off a,
you know, a template.

82
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:52,209
Okay.

83
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:55,636
Yeah, that's good, keep doing that.

84
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:05,388
# Slime princess, you're all right. #

85
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,966
# Flame princess, you're okay. #

86
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,428
# Wild berry princess could be better. #

87
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:13,271
# All of the princesses are
pretty all right, but, #

88
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,030
# oh, Bubblegum, you look
like a lot of fun. #

89
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:24,230
# I write outside, and that
is how I know. #

90
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:25,997
# Hey, princess did you get my text #

91
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:28,995
# with the picture of my
awesome gun show? #

92
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,351
# I'm also working on my pecs. #

93
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:34,323
# If you'd like I'll send you
a picture of that too. #

94
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:39,769
# Oh, Bubblegum, I really need someone. #

95
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,980
# Or anyone. #

96
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:45,087
# Pretty much anyone. #

97
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:48,272
# I'm so alone. #

98
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:51,998
# Won't somebody tell me
what's wrong with me? #

99
00:05:51,999 --> 00:06:03,002
# Anybody? #

100
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:07,007
Grob in the sky, please tell me why!

101
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:09,306
Stop acting like this!

102
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:11,449
No! It's just starting to get good!

103
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,857
Anybody!

104
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:17,714
Princesses, I command you! Love me!

105
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:18,715
Love me!

106
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:21,813
Love me. Love me.

107
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,146
Stop acting crazy.

108
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:26,101
I just wanna be loved!

109
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:29,334
I'm sorry I pushed you.

110
00:06:35,412 --> 00:06:37,226
I'll just stay out of your way.

111
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:42,772
Again, I'm sorry I pushed you.

112
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,376
What you got? An apple?

113
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:09,274
# You're so annoying,
you pitiful old man. #

114
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:13,280
# I'd like to help you, but
I don't know if I can. #

115
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:17,812
# I thought you were nuts. #

116
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:25,924
# But you're really really
really nuts. #

117
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:32,649
# Everytime I move, eventually you find
me and start hanging around. #

118
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:36,915
# Just another lame excuse to see me,
man, it's getting me down. #

119
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:41,113
# You know? I'm actually
glad to see you. #

120
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:45,802
# Maybe I'm the one who's... #

121
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:49,123
nuts.

122
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:51,926
Hold on.

123
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:54,906
Do you... like me?

124
00:07:55,494 --> 00:07:57,688
Of course I do, you old jerk!

125
00:07:57,986 --> 00:07:58,689
Really?

126
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,989
How about one of this?

127
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:14,228
Not like that!

128
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:18,071
You don't remember anything,
do you, Simon?

129
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:19,003
What-mon?

130
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:22,046
Why do you even come see me
when you don't remember me?

131
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:23,896
You don't even know who you are.

132
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:26,741
Yes I do. I am a lyricist.

133
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:28,812
It's all here, on the page.

134
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:31,156
The page in song, baby.

135
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:33,627
On this receipt, on this take out menu,

136
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,264
on this newspapers.

137
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:42,602
Look, this clipping...
this was you, Simon,

138
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:43,603
before the war.

139
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,330
This! You took this picture.

140
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:55,794
You scribbled all over it.

141
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:01,032
Oh, oh, are they good lyrics?

142
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:03,229
I'll get the keyboard.

143
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,577
What? Wait, listen!

144
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:09,361
Yeah, let's go! What does it say?
Sing out, sister.

145
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:21,618
# Marceline, is it just you and me
in the wreckage of the world? #

146
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:26,005
# That must be so confusing
for a little girl. #

147
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:30,404
# And I know you're going to
need me here with you, #

148
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,918
# but I'm losing myself and I'm affraid
you're gonna lose me too. #

149
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,919
Ooh, yeah! Keep it going!

150
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:39,436
# This magic keeps me alive, #

151
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:41,921
# but it's making me crazy, #

152
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:44,004
# and I need to save you, #

153
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:46,209
# but who's going to save me? #

154
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,475
# Please forgive me for whatever I do #

155
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:53,010
# when I don't remember you. #

156
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:56,056
Wow, I love that. Hot stuff.

157
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:58,349
What? You don't remember what it means?

158
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:02,437
Look!

159
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,687
# Marceline, #

160
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:10,641
# I can feel myself sliping away. #

161
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:14,938
# I can't remember what
it made me say, #

162
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:19,031
# but I remember that I saw you frown. #

163
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:24,064
# I swear it wasn't me,
it was the crown. #

164
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:30,695
# This magic keeps me alive,
but it's making me crazy. #

165
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,135
# And I need to save you, #

166
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:35,000
# but who's going to save me? #

167
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,108
# Please, forgive me for... #

168
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:39,715
What is going on in there?

169
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,200
I have no idea.

170
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:47,850
# Please forgive me for whatever I do, #

171
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:50,826
# when I don't remember you. #
