Are you getting
all bit up by mosquitos?

8
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:37,707
I don't know.
I'm getting bit up by something.

9
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:39,270
Man, I can't believe you said

10
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:41,077
this was a good
swimming hole.

11
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,981
<i>I said it might be good.</i>

12
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:45,384
It's not, though.
- True.

13
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:47,786
- Wanna just go?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:50,382
This place smells
like green beans.

15
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:54,619
- My name's Woobeewoo.
- Oh, whoa.

16
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:58,360
I need your help.
My people are in trouble.

17
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,231
I'm a Mudscamp.

18
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:02,293
Yeah, Woobeewoo.
Of course we'll help.

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,168
Why didn't you just
say something before?

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,798
I'm shy.

21
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:07,604
It took me a while
to work up the nerve.

22
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:09,439
Oh, right on.
You good now?

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,208
We'll see. Come.
I'll take you to my village.

24
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,575
Here we are --
the village of my people.

25
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:19,450
It doesn't have
an official name,

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,716
but I call it
"South Woobeewoo."

27
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,055
Uh, this way.

28
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,755
This is the village elder.
He'll fill you in on the deets.

29
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,422
Greetings, heroes.

30
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:33,034
Bleh!
Oh! Ugh!

31
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:34,694
I'm so sorry about that.

32
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,931
You know, we -- we secrete
stink-oil all day

33
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:38,997
out of our awful-sauce glands.

34
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:41,804
You know, I guess I should
have warned you.

35
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,435
Anyway, let me cut the cheese.

36
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:45,070
<i>- Cut to the chase.
- Yes.</i>

37
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,240
You know, I mean, of course,
cut to the chase.

38
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,874
I mean, for many --
for many moons now,

39
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,045
our village has been
under siege by the Megafrog.

40
00:01:56,824 --> 00:02:01,421
<i>He's 100 stories of 110%
10-speed terror like bam --</i>

41
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,158
like fresh out the grease.

42
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:05,359
I mean, he cases us all
up and down,

43
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:07,299
from first base to home,

44
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:08,996
trying to eat us alive.

45
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,663
We -- we've always
managed to escape,

46
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:12,400
<i>but it's crazy scary.</i>

47
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:14,806
I mean, w-what if you got ate?
Think about it.

48
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:17,311
All alone in a stomach
full of acid.

49
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:19,506
"Mommy!
Mommy, mommy, help me!"

50
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,515
"Billy, is that you?"

51
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:23,448
"Mommy, you sound exactly --

52
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,487
Mommy, you sound
exactly like me!

53
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:27,579
Mommy, you sound
exactly like me!"

54
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:29,590
"Billy, uh..."

55
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:31,956
Anyway, if this keeps up,

56
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,291
we'll have to move
to the city and get jobs.

57
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,298
We don't know how --
how to do anything cool.

58
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,458
Look, see?

59
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,559
The-- they're already
practicing, the poor fools.

60
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:42,160
They don't know
what they're in for.

61
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:43,670
Whoa! Relax, buddy!

62
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:46,003
You're talking to the right
couple of guys.

63
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:47,064
Yeah, man.

64
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:48,973
Me and Jake will bust
this Megafrog up

65
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:49,942
right up his bumblestop!

66
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:55,241
That is excellent news.

67
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:56,784
I mean, here,
take this, please.

68
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,945
It's not much, but --
but it's all we have.

69
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,716
It's -- it's a bag
of lollies.

70
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:02,848
That's nice.
Thanks, man.

71
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:04,358
Now, farewell, heroes.

72
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:08,192
We're counting on you --
for reals!

73
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,598
Hmm.
Getting anything?

74
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,397
Yeah, but it's hard
to make out.

75
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:17,064
Could just be some footprints...
or old doody.

76
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:20,336
Word.
Hey, I have an idea.

77
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,536
We can use those lollipops
to leave a trail.

78
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,806
That way we won't get
lost out here.

79
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,371
Yeah, that's a great
idea, man.

80
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:29,644
I was just gonna throw 'em all
on the ground anyway.

81
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:32,653
Womp. Womp.

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,211
Womp.
Womp.

83
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:36,723
This way.

84
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,283
The thing with frogs is they got
a real subtle smell.

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,760
It's kind of like
when you open

86
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:43,093
a new thing of, um, CD-Rs.

87
00:03:43,164 --> 00:03:45,793
Like electric celery?

88
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:48,359
Yeah... but subtler.

89
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,371
Mm-hmm!
Just as I suspected.

90
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,462
Sweet.

91
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,474
These will take us
right to him.

92
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:55,976
Come on, Jake!

93
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,158
Oh, ha ha!

94
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:13,820
Heh-heh! Heh-heh! Hmm.

95
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:15,158
Huh.

96
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,698
We've passed this butt tree
like three times.

97
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:18,789
Oh, yeah.

98
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,528
We should probably
backtrack --

99
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,661
get reoriented
and all that.

100
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,171
Word.

101
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:26,901
Wait, these prints are
all messed up.

102
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:28,374
Whoa! Yeah.

103
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:31,413
Guess we better follow
the lollipops back.

104
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,971
- Where's those at?
- We ran out a while ago.

105
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:36,517
Sna-a-a-p.

106
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:38,678
Totally lost. Dang!

107
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:40,312
Do you think maybe
the Megafrog

108
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:42,050
made all those footprints
on purpose

109
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:44,217
so we'd use up all our lollies
and get totally lost?

110
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,261
What? Nah, man.

111
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,193
Frogs are mighty dumb.
You know that.

112
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:50,424
<i>He's probably running around
like that 'cause he's lost.</i>

113
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,432
Plus, we're not even lost.

114
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,129
I just got to stretch up
past these trees

115
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:57,263
and see where we're at.

116
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,875
Dang! It's all misty.

117
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:05,243
It's kind of nice up here,
though.

118
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:12,181
Man, forget that!

119
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:14,518
I can't see anything
through that mess.

120
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,319
Plus, I got struck
by lightning!

121
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,326
We're gonna have to set up camp
and wait out the storm.

122
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:21,089
Cool.
I call fire patrol!

123
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:23,358
Yeah, me, too!

124
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,497
Do you remember how to make
a fire with sticks?

125
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:29,093
Yeah, man. It's easy.

126
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,934
Uh...
rub 'em together, right?

127
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,839
Oh, yeah.

128
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:36,777
I don't think
it's working, man.

129
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:40,281
I think I saw some guy
do it like this once.

130
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:42,078
That's not it.

131
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,846
I think you're onto something,
though.

132
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,580
Yeah, here we go.

133
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:49,256
Friction!

134
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:52,088
Come on, boys! Come on!

135
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,651
Mwah!

136
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,594
I don't know.

137
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,794
You just gotta get
some momentum going.

138
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,497
Ouch!

139
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,096
Glob-globbing stick!

140
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:06,266
Glob-globbing swamp!

141
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,744
Oh, hey, you got
the fire going.

142
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:14,145
Right on.

143
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:16,207
Jake, how did you --

144
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:18,253
What the...?
It's the Megafrog!

145
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,582
Quick, put the fire out!

146
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:24,090
Jake, look.

147
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:29,558
He's just sitting there.
What's he doing out there?

148
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,292
I don't know,
but let's pound him

149
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:32,765
while he's vulnerable.

150
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,165
Okay, sweetles.

151
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,672
Ow!

152
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,013
What?

153
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,953
Whoa!

154
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,463
Oh, yeah!

155
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:22,212
Wha?

156
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:23,808
Jake, wake up. Look.

157
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:25,876
Ow, my head hurts.

158
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:27,945
Look at that thing.

159
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:30,287
Oh, what?!

160
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:31,656
Yeah.

161
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:33,991
Hey, whoa!
That gives me a great idea!

162
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:36,462
We could make a Finn and Jake
out of sticks and stuff

163
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,590
and lure the Megafrog
out here...

164
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,135
then badonk him
right while he's all confused.

165
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:42,727
Yeah.

166
00:07:42,803 --> 00:07:44,772
That's a great idea, man.

167
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,740
That's a great idea,
Jake.

168
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:47,900
Fuh, fuh-fuh.

169
00:07:47,975 --> 00:07:49,568
Fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh.

170
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:50,577
Fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh, fuh,

171
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:51,510
fuh-fuh, fuh, fuh-fuh-fuh.

172
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,740
What?
What is it, Jake?

173
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:54,907
F-F-F-Fro-o-o-g!

174
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:56,575
Wha?

175
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,214
Jake, run!

176
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:00,880
Aah! Aah! Aah!

177
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:02,446
Jake, stretch us
out of here!

178
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,853
Come on, Jake!

179
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,826
Ow.

180
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:15,335
Jake, let's hide in this cave!

181
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:17,998
Hmm?

182
00:08:18,072 --> 00:08:19,370
Shmow town, dude!

183
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,205
That guy's gonna dingle our bones
into tapioca pudding!

184
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:24,108
Finn, that is gross,
man!

185
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,612
Don't use language
like that!

186
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:36,949
Chop that!

187
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,801
Ohh!

188
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:56,969
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

189
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:59,309
Aah! He's eating me!

190
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,475
Aah! Gently eating me!

191
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,815
No teeth! Mostly tongue!

192
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,150
Hmm? Hmm.

193
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,884
I need your help.
My people are in trouble.

194
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:11,289
I'm shy.

195
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:13,419
I mean, he chases us
all up and down,

196
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:15,395
from first base to home.

197
00:09:15,463 --> 00:09:17,091
We've always managed
to escape.

198
00:09:17,164 --> 00:09:18,427
Getting anything?

199
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:20,331
Yeah, but it's hard
to make out.

200
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,391
I'm shy.

201
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:22,493
First base.

202
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,970
Yeah, but it's hard
to make out.

203
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:26,030
- I'm shy.
- It's hard to make out.

204
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,042
Hmm. That's it!

205
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,737
Jake, wait!

206
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:33,137
Sick, dude!

207
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,204
Huh?

208
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,909
I know how to stop him!

209
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:42,748
Nyah chow!

210
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,337
Aah! This is rad!

211
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:42,406
I'm hot again!

212
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:44,145
Thanks, little dudes!

213
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:47,017
<i>I really appreciate it.</i>

214
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:49,079
I don't get it, though.

215
00:10:49,156 --> 00:10:52,183
I kissed just about everything
I could get my lips on.

216
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:54,285
How come it only worked
with you?

217
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,728
You can't break your
own curse by kissing somebody.

218
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:59,699
Somebody's gotta kiss you.
- Oh. Weird.

219
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,463
Well, thanks, man.

220
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,767
I don't know a lot of dudes
who'd do that to help a guy out.

221
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:05,863
Whatevs.
