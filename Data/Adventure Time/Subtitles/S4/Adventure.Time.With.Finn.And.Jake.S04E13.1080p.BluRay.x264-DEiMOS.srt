1
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:43,342
Donkin' princess!

2
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:48,289
Okay, okay.

3
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:51,417
How about I give you a big
cowboy hat?

4
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:54,690
Then will you let
the hostages go?

5
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,697
No! No!

6
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:58,858
Don't play games with me,
Princess!

7
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:02,335
I want that crown!
No crown, no hostages!

8
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:05,635
Well, obviously,
that's going to be a problem

9
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:09,302
because I'm the princess,
and I need my crown.

10
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:10,902
So...

11
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,503
No, Princess!
You are problem --

12
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,515
The problem princess!

13
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:17,108
Just give me that crown!

14
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:19,517
Why does he want your crown,
anyway, Princess?

15
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:21,214
Yeah. What's his beef?

16
00:01:21,277 --> 00:01:23,382
I don't know, guys.
He's crazy.

17
00:01:23,446 --> 00:01:25,722
He's left me no choice.

18
00:01:25,782 --> 00:01:28,388
I'm sending in the banana guards.

19
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:31,125
It's about to turn
crazy-nasty.

20
00:01:31,187 --> 00:01:33,133
Hello.
Captain Banana Guard?

21
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:35,294
Wait a second, Princess.

22
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:37,736
Why don't me and Finn just
sneak in there incognito

23
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:40,570
and neutralize the threat
old-fashioned spy-guy style?

24
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,007
Hmm...

25
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:45,012
Okay, but if you guys aren't
out of there by 4:00,

26
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:46,979
I'm sending in the guards.

27
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:49,813
Okay. I was thinking I could
dress up like a mailman!

28
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:51,819
Yeah! Yeah!
And I could wear all black!

29
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,821
And I could be like,
you know,

30
00:01:53,877 --> 00:01:57,450
like... your shadow!

31
00:01:57,514 --> 00:02:00,256
Hmm... I can't really
see that working.

32
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:02,922
Yeah, the shadow thing
might be pushing it.

33
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:05,262
Oh, no, no, no.
That part's fine.

34
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,927
I was talking about you
dressing up like a mailman.

35
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:08,992
What?!

36
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:10,936
But I always wanted to be a mailman!

37
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:13,838
Nah, you don't
look like a mailman.

38
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:15,433
You look like a milk/nan.

39
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:18,138
Let's get you a proper
milkman outfit.

40
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:26,351
Hmm... You ready?

41
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:29,754
Yeah! Let's bust it!

42
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:36,520
Hello!

43
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,532
Hello?!
Who the heck are you?

44
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:40,295
I'm gonna smash your face!

45
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:42,233
Uh, milkman, sir.

46
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:44,898
I brought the milk...
for the hostages, sir.

47
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:46,565
Huh? Oh.

48
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:48,404
I thought maybe you were
a spy guy or something.

49
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:50,240
Go ahead.
Give everyone some milk,

50
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,938
then get the math outta here!

51
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,844
Yes, sir.

52
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:55,246
- Milk, sir?
- Thanks.

53
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:56,750
- Milk?
- Thanks.

54
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:58,251
- Milk?
- Thank you.

55
00:02:58,308 --> 00:02:59,343
Some milk?

56
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:00,854
Psst! Get ready, Jake.

57
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,355
When we get to the cookie,

58
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:04,187
you throw some milk in his face

59
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:06,693
and yell,
"Alvin's Hot Juice Box.

60
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:09,628
Alvin's Hot Juice Box."

61
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:11,461
He'll be really confused.

62
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:13,467
And that's when we grab him
and tie him up style.

63
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:17,035
Come in, Cookie. This is Chipper. Over.

64
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:18,538
Go ahead, Chipper. Over.

65
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:21,075
I'm too short to lock the backdoor. Over.

66
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,076
Hold tight, Chipper.
Chipler's on his way.

67
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:28,476
- You got that, Chipler?
- Affirmative.

68
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:29,642
Did you hear that?

69
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,481
Yeah. Change of plans.

70
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,145
I'll go take care of those chips.

71
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,155
You keep the cookie distracted.

72
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:36,622
Yeah, I can do that.

73
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:38,818
Okay, awesome.

74
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:43,758
Milk? Milk?

75
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,356
Milk?

76
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:46,525
Some milk?

77
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:48,262
What?
Oh. Look.

78
00:03:48,324 --> 00:03:50,270
You should probably split, buddy.

79
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:52,272
Things are about to get pretty
flipped-out in here.

80
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:53,932
Oh. Sure.
Sorry, man.

81
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:55,772
I was just trying
to get away from that

82
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:57,903
rotten Princess Bubblegum
for a while, you know?

83
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:59,537
Isn't she just the worst?

84
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:02,173
Wait, you hate
Princess Bubblegum, too'?

85
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:03,239
Get outta here!

86
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:05,445
Oh, yeah, man!
She's the worst --

87
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:07,954
sitting out there all safe and cozy

88
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:10,287
while I'm risking my life
tootin' around in here

89
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:13,486
in a stupid milkman costume.

90
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,052
Wait, costume?

91
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:16,563
Oh. Um...

92
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:18,621
<i>I just mean it feels like
a costume.</i>

93
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:20,964
'Cause I wanted to be
a mailman so bad, you see?

94
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:24,437
But the princess made me be
a milkman, anyway.

95
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:25,939
Boy, I hear you, brother.

96
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:28,100
Cookie? You there? Over.

97
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:31,111
Yeah.
Go ahead, Chipolina. Over.

98
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,272
I just saw a light go on in the stock room.

99
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:35,612
Probably nothing.
I'll check it out. Over.

100
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:37,117
Okay. Over.

101
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,112
Hmm...

102
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,591
Looks like a false alarm, Cookie.

103
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:47,594
It's just some kid's
Baby Snuggleghost night-light.

104
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,958
Hes-yang

105
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:52,791
Alvin's Hot Juice Box!
Alvin's Hot Juice...

106
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:54,425
So, what's your story, man?

107
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,094
How'd she doodie on you?

108
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:00,732
I was just a kid, man --
just a little kid

109
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:03,141
when I got doodied on.

110
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,138
I was the new guy
at the candy orphanage.

111
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:07,806
They called me Baby Snaps.

112
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,816
I tried to make friends
with the other kids.

113
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:11,818
Come on, guys!
Let's dance it up!

114
00:05:11,874 --> 00:05:13,581
They were always
too depressed to play.

115
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:16,487
No, no.
We're too depressed.

116
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:18,492
Things went on like that for a while,

117
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:21,028
then one day...

118
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:22,620
She showed up.

119
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,323
Everything was different.

120
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:28,164
...a thunderous cheer,
as Baby Whoozlefut...

121
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:30,966
Everything was -- was
better with her around.

122
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:33,803
And something inside me changed
that day, too.

123
00:05:33,863 --> 00:05:36,309
And then later, she told me
I could be anything I wanted.

124
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:39,711
Anything your sweet heart desires!

125
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:42,215
I told her I wanted
to be a princess like her,

126
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,548
so I could make
all the children happy.

127
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:47,588
I want to be a princess, like you!

128
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:54,495
And she laughed in my face, man!

129
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,894
It really messed me up.

130
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,164
Holy schmow, man!
That's terrible!

131
00:06:01,224 --> 00:06:03,204
That's really terrible.

132
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,865
Listen, I --

133
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:07,566
She lied to me!

134
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,405
Yeah, but maybe she didn't realize

135
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:11,342
how much it meant to you.

136
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:15,144
No, she just wants to hog all
the princessin' for herself!

137
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:17,150
All chips, report in!

138
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:19,208
It's time to get real!
Over.

139
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:22,222
Chips? Chips?
Over.

140
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:25,350
Chips?!
Where are my chips?!

141
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:28,362
Chipolina! Chipler!
Chipton! Chipper?!

142
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,694
Is anyone there?!
Chipface?!

143
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:33,734
Something happened to my chips!

144
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,565
Aaaah!

145
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,770
I'm about to flip out, man...

146
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,366
and take that crown!
- Whoa, whoa. Wait.

147
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:44,036
It doesn't have to be like this!

148
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,773
You don't need that crown!

149
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,337
You can start over, man.

150
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:49,747
You can start a new kingdom --
your own kingdom,

151
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:53,310
where everyone can be
whatever they want to be.

152
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:55,652
I can be the mailman, and you --

153
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:57,783
you can be the princess.

154
00:06:57,847 --> 00:07:00,191
- My own kingdom?
- Yeah, man.

155
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:03,059
I... I'd like that.

156
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:05,622
Okay, then.
Just sit tight, Princess.

157
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:07,634
I'll get us out of here.

158
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,692
Hey! Hey!

159
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,397
I'm coming out!

160
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,463
What?

161
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:17,107
Jake!

162
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:20,477
Jake, what's going on?
Where's Finn?

163
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:22,538
Where are the hostages?

164
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:24,516
Don't worry, Princess.
It's okay now.

165
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:27,180
Princess Cookie's gonna go away.

166
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,189
You just got to give him
a horse to escape with,

167
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:30,383
and he'll go.

168
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:31,720
Right.

169
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:33,783
And then you and Finn
hunt him down

170
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,488
and put him in the dungeon.

171
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:38,157
No, wait. He said
he'd go away forever.

172
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:40,030
Can't we just let him go?

173
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,296
No. That cookie is a menace.

174
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:46,329
Once the hostages are safe,
Cookie goes in my dungeon...

175
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:49,377
in my dungeon for his life.

176
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,080
Oh, boy!

177
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:00,644
Would you look at that!

178
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,417
Dang!

179
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,358
Okay, well, she's all yours.

180
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,123
Hot diggity!

181
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:10,790
Ah-ah-ah. Man, that horse
ain't no good.

182
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:15,097
That's a trap horse!
- What are we gonna do?!

183
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:17,001
It's okay, man.
I'm Jake.

184
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:18,663
J-J-J-Jingo-Jango!

185
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:21,072
Whoa! Ha-ha!
You're magic!

186
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,575
Yeah!

187
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:24,305
Yee-hoo!

188
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,778
After them!

189
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:29,975
We're really doing it!

190
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,182
Jake! What are you doing?!
What happened to the plan?

191
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:40,193
New plan. I'm gonna
help Princess Cookie escape.

192
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:42,490
What?!
But -- but he's a criminal.

193
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:45,158
No, man.
Princess Cookie's a good guy.

194
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:46,996
He just got dealt a bad hand.

195
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:48,660
He's only trying to be what

196
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:51,364
following how his dreams
make you want to be, man.

197
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:52,872
Whaaaat?!

198
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:54,806
You're either with us
or against us.

199
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:57,310
Um...
against?

200
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:58,845
Aah! Ohh!

201
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,452
Hold on tight, Cookie!

202
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:11,856
I'm gonna jump the gorge!

203
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,323
No, Jake.
Stop the horse.

204
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:18,558
I can make it!

205
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:21,397
Ohh! Aah!

206
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:22,959
Princess Cookie!

207
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:24,197
Are you all right?

208
00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:27,105
I'm done for, Jake.

209
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:30,510
No!
Everythings gonna be fine!

210
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:32,512
I won't let them
put you in the dungeon!

211
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:34,514
Just let me talk to them!

212
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,106
No, Jake.

213
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:39,642
Thank you for your help, but
it's too late for me.

214
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,251
I'll never be a princess.

215
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:46,259
At least for a moment,

216
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:49,262
you helped me feel like a princess.

217
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:51,264
It was wonderful.

218
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,231
Thank you, Jake.

219
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:56,535
Careful, Princess!

220
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:58,629
You know what --
it's funny,

221
00:09:58,694 --> 00:10:02,232
but you sort of remind me
of a mailman I used to know.

222
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:03,709
I do?

223
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:06,110
Yep.

224
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:12,382
Princess!

225
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:24,289
I glubbed up!

226
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:28,935
Knight to E5.

227
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,706
Where's Baby Snaps?

228
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,503
Excuse me, your highness?

229
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:37,170
Jake!

230
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:41,114
Oh, hey.
Check it out.

231
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,776
Special delivery
from the Grass Kingdom.

232
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:54,686
He's a princess?

233
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,230
- I had no idea.
- Royalty!

234
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:02,596
Ahh!
