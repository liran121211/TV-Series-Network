1
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:41,827
Oh, man!

2
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:42,998
All right. What's next?

3
00:00:43,074 --> 00:00:44,121
Let's see.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,043
First, we visit Tree Trunks
for apple pie,

5
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,292
and then we go to Bubblegum's
science music thing.

6
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:50,248
Wait -- what about the
movie at the drive-in?

7
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:52,426
That's after we make
dream sandwiches.

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,173
Whoo! Let's go!

9
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:55,253
Apple pie!

10
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:56,179
Whoo!

11
00:00:58,798 --> 00:00:59,594
Tree Trunks!

12
00:00:59,674 --> 00:01:00,675
Huh?

13
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,306
- T.T.!
- Tree Trunks!

14
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:04,638
Oh, my, look who's here.

15
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:06,064
Yoo-hoo!

16
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:07,015
Whoa!

17
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:08,190
Oh. yeah!

18
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:10,610
Howdy, Jake. Howdy, Finn.

19
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:12,278
Hello.

20
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:13,571
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:15,364
I never really left.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,909
Mr. Pig's been so kind,

23
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:22,330
helping me
tend to my rose garden.

24
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:25,162
Hmm.

25
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,083
Cool.

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,126
Cool, cool.

27
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:28,294
Cool, cool, cool.

28
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,714
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

29
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:35,001
Oh, you.

30
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:36,462
Where's the apple pie,
Tree Trunks?

31
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:38,842
Yeah, my stomach is
jonesin' for it bad.

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,561
Oh, you all are so early that
I haven't even started.

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,182
Ahh, ha.

34
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:50,938
I love her so much.

35
00:01:51,017 --> 00:01:52,485
Whoa! You love her?

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,903
What? No!

37
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:55,070
You just said
you love her.

38
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,648
You're crazy.

39
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,324
Dude, come on.
We heard you.

40
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:01,823
I think I am in
love with her!

41
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:03,530
But I don't know
how to go about it.

42
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,206
Dude, you should just
tell her how you feel.

43
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,578
Whew.

44
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:09,252
What are you boys chatting about?

45
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:11,625
Hmm?

46
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:13,627
Uh-huh. All right. Okay.

47
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,888
Miss Tree Trunks, ma'am, today
I wish to speak my feelings.

48
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:22,842
Mr. Pig, what's going on?

49
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:27,430
When I see you, my heart
beats like a choo-choo train.

50
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:30,391
When you stand near me, I get
so nervous, I cannot move...

51
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:32,191
Ohhh.

52
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:37,105
Mm, that's good.

53
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:38,235
Shush.

54
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:39,861
I feel the same.

55
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:41,659
I have a feeling
that this feeling

56
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:46,240
is what others call "love."

57
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:48,324
What should we do, then?

58
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:49,751
We should hug.

59
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,667
Tree Trunks, you gonna
bring some apple pie to

60
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:55,248
Princess Bubblegum's thing?

61
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:57,709
Uh, yeah, Jake, yeah.

62
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,295
Well, okay.

63
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:01,846
See ya later, then.

64
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:03,298
Mmm.

65
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:12,189
Bonk, beep, woomp, wowoow,
bing-bong, shoo,

66
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:13,687
da-be-dop-dop, ooh.

67
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:16,694
Where is she?

68
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,652
You givin' me a
back rub, Bro?

69
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:21,608
What?

70
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:24,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:26,700
Hmmmmmraa!

72
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:27,621
Is that...

73
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,533
It's Tree Trunks!

74
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,165
Pie! Pie!
Lay it right here!

75
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:38,670
Oh, Jake, I tried
to bake an apple pie,

76
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,050
but this cutie kept
distracting me.

77
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:48,142
No apple pie?!

78
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:52,601
This is making
me uncomfortable.

79
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,478
They are
snuggling too long.

80
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:55,854
What is happening?

81
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,060
I forgot my glasses.

82
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,152
Huh? Oh, gross.

83
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:06,111
Hyah!

84
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:07,491
Break it up! Break it up!

85
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,072
Okay, the love show is over.

86
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:10,657
Princess, please continue.

87
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,787
Hmm.

88
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,851
This is too much!

89
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:34,268
Aaaaah! Aaaah!

90
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:36,441
It's driving me crazy!

91
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,894
Cinnamon Bun, do something!

92
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:40,650
Okay.

93
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:42,071
Hey, everyone!

94
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:44,069
The concert is over!

95
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:45,365
That's not what I --

96
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:48,115
The concert's over, Princess!

97
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:55,001
Princess, how's about a slow
song so me and my man

98
00:04:55,076 --> 00:04:57,170
can dance cheek-to-cheek?

99
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:03,635
Humph!

100
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:14,683
Humph!

101
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:15,979
Err!

102
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:19,559
Why is everybody givin'
me the hairy eyeball?

103
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:21,644
Y'all are too affectionate.

104
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:24,823
It makes people feel bothered
when you and the pig flaunt

105
00:05:24,897 --> 00:05:26,319
your affection in public.

106
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,948
They don't want us to
flaunt what we have?

107
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:31,121
You two need to hide your love,

108
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:35,166
Or else you'll end up making
the whole world throw up.

109
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:39,121
We promise to keep
our affection hidden.

110
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:40,546
Thank you.

111
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:46,631
Have you seen my other shoe?

112
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,509
I think I saw
it in the closet.

113
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,307
Aah! Under my shoe?!

114
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:57,263
Outta here!

115
00:06:06,314 --> 00:06:07,941
This carriage is for babies!

116
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,077
For babies!

117
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:22,873
Nice stacks of sandwiches.

118
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:24,878
You shouldn't have
bought so many flavors.

119
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:27,927
I had to make a sandwich for
each flavor and for each flavor

120
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:29,094
combination.

121
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,548
I'm making a cheese sandwich.
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch!

122
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:32,473
Mwah!

123
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:33,549
Ugh.

124
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,227
Tree Trunks! Pig! Come on!

125
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:40,728
We're trying to hide our love,
but it's so difficult.

126
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:43,810
Try harder!

127
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:48,235
Doesn't look like Tree Trunks
and Pig are around.

128
00:06:48,314 --> 00:06:51,113
Yeah, looks like
the coast is clear.

129
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:54,244
Look at this cup!

130
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,243
Now look at this cup!

131
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:57,494
Look at this one!

132
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:00,201
Oh, man!

133
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:02,749
Just try to ignore it
and watch the movie.

134
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:03,921
<i>I can't ignore that!</i>

135
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:14,386
Stop!

136
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:18,015
Tree Trunks, this has
gone on long enough.

137
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:20,938
No more spending time with
the Pig unless you do it...

138
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:23,516
inside your own home.

139
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,398
But, Finn,
an unmarried couple

140
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:28,650
living together
under one roof --

141
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,403
that's indecent!

142
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:33,200
Then why don't you
two just get married?

143
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:34,903
We don't want to rush things.

144
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,488
- Marriage is a big step.

145
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:37,868
- We need time to get
to know each other.

146
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:40,245
Then I guess we
only have one option.

147
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:42,709
All right.

148
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:44,128
You can't do this.

149
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:45,546
Wait.
No! Stop!

150
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:48,041
Take them away!

151
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:49,376
Sweet meat!

152
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:51,962
Little dove!

153
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:53,421
Sorry, Tree Trunks.

154
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:58,134
So, where do you live?

155
00:07:58,217 --> 00:07:59,560
I'm homeless.

156
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:01,512
Oh.

157
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:08,062
I guess I'll just go
back to eating criminals.

158
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:10,354
Ugh!

159
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:13,362
Guh! I miss her!

160
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:17,703
I don't know what I'm
gonna do without him, Finn.

161
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,077
