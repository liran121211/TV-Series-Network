1
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:35,944
Okay. I'm going to lower the screen.

2
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:37,506
Tell me what you see.

3
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:39,984
Crunchy, you look like
a rainbow.

4
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,351
It's beautiful.
Can you guys see that?

5
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,357
Nope, only you can see it because

6
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:47,019
you're hooked up
to the aura visualizer.

7
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,960
But actually, I'm lying.

8
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:51,465
We can see everything you see
on this screen.

9
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:53,626
Now I'm gonna send that image
into Crunchy.

10
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:54,690
Whoa!

11
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:56,293
The aura's gone.

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,100
- Except...
- Whoa!

13
00:00:58,161 --> 00:00:59,869
...Crunchy's true essence manifested

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,535
in the material plane.

15
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,668
I want to see
Peppermint Butler's aura!

16
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:06,078
You don't want to see that.

17
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:08,548
Yeah, we do!
Right, Princess?

18
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:11,381
Sure, Finn. Just let me
recalibrate the device.

19
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:14,652
No! Bunk that.
I'm tired. Come on, Finn.

20
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:16,315
Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,452
Yeah, me and Jake,
we got to peace out.

22
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:19,791
Goodnight.

23
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:23,029
Hey, what's going on
in here?

24
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:25,694
- Yo, guys!
- Hey, Finn.

25
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:27,705
Whoa, what's that?
Security cams?

26
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:30,173
Yeah, man. You gotta see
some crazy stu--

27
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,572
Yo, shut up!

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,133
- Oh, shoot.
- What?

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,474
Nothing.

30
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:36,673
- What is it?
- Nothing!

31
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:38,306
Show us now!

32
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:39,577
Show you what?

33
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,085
What you said!

34
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:42,676
We didn't say nothing!

35
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:44,346
It's too late for take backs!

36
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:46,085
We practically
know everything already!

37
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,592
Now show us!

38
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:49,594
Okay, but you can't tell anyone.

39
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,823
Yeah, this is our weird secret.

40
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:52,989
Of course, dude.

41
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:55,091
All right.
Now look at monitor three.

42
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,761
Can you see it?

43
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:59,532
Oh, yeah. That's uh...
Who is that?

44
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:01,199
That's Chocoberry.

45
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:03,072
Why you guys spying on Chocoberry?

46
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,236
No, man.
Look there, in the corner.

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,008
- Who's that?
- Zoom in, dude.

48
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,744
Plus, plus, plus, plus, plus,
plus, plus, plus --

49
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:13,515
Lemongrab! What the...?!

50
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:16,182
This is our weird secret, okay?

51
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:17,690
Remember that.

52
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:21,888
How long has this been
going on?

53
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:24,592
He's shown up every night for
the past two weeks.

54
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:27,226
He goes to different rooms
and just stands there.

55
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,895
And you didn't tell me?!

56
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,904
If we told you, then we knew
you'd mess up

57
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:32,565
our weird TV show.

58
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,577
Banana guarding is boring.

59
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,168
I'm gonna talk to him.

60
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:37,872
Oh, no. You see?

61
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:40,007
Sorry, guys.

62
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,109
Lemongrab!

63
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:44,414
Nyah!

64
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:46,752
Why are you stalking my peeps?!

65
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:49,314
I am within my rights!

66
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:51,328
Yeah, but what are you doing?

67
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,159
It's creeping me out.

68
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:54,822
Uh, I am the Earl...

69
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:57,025
- Yeah?
- The Earl...

70
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:58,568
<i>of nothing!</i>

71
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,231
Wait!
What do you mean, "nothing"?

72
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:05,436
Castle Lemongrab has no citizens!

73
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:07,637
You have excess candies!

74
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,649
You must donate.
Dona-a-a-te!

75
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:13,413
In your dreams, you freak.

76
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:15,647
But you don't get
along with others.

77
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,950
I don't understand you, Lemongrab.

78
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:21,620
No one --
no one understands!

79
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:26,190
I am alone, and you made me
like this.

80
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:29,033
You made me!

81
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:31,071
You made me!

82
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:34,164
You're... my... glob!

83
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,936
You're my gob!

84
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,171
What are we gonna do?

85
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,805
Something totally bum slops.

86
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,612
No, no! We won't go!

87
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:45,675
Please! Please!

88
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,179
All I need is three healthy
volunteers

89
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:49,986
to move in with Lemongrab.

90
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:52,584
He's all by himself
with no one to govern.

91
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,357
No, no! We won't go!

92
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:55,896
No, no! We won't go!

93
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:57,591
Come on, Mr. Cupcake.

94
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,929
Just for a little while?

95
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,866
I can't, Princess.

96
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:03,372
My arm is broken.

97
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:05,408
Dude, you didn't have
to do that.

98
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:08,138
All right, what's
it gonna take, people?

99
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,839
Two things, Princess.

100
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:14,080
Yeah, that's right.
Back up, fools.

101
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,416
You got nerve
showing your faces here,

102
00:04:16,476 --> 00:04:17,978
Notorious Pup Gang.

103
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:19,852
Bunch of bad apples.

104
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:21,754
Back up, Finn.
I'll take you out!

105
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,589
We came out of hiding

106
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:25,925
'cause all y'all is scared
of a Lemon man.

107
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:29,592
And we ain't afraid,
so we gots demands.

108
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:31,192
And what is that?

109
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:33,636
One -- total amnesty
for past crimes

110
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:35,902
committed by the Pup Gang.

111
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:37,909
Hmm... granted.

112
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,913
Wait. They threw a basketball
at my head one time.

113
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:42,277
You gonna let that slide?

114
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:44,613
<i>We only did that 'cause
you're old.</i>

115
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:47,312
You sacks!
I'll rip your cups!

116
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,720
Jake, please.
What is your second demand?

117
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,919
We want the big
cash-money wad --

118
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:56,087
enough to provide for our
delinquent mothers

119
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:58,563
so that, hopefully,
they'll show us the love

120
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,467
we always dreamed about
in our sad, young lives.

121
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:03,799
Huh.

122
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,670
I grant you
the big cash-money wad!

123
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,609
Now off with you
to Castle Lemongrab!

124
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:12,678
Yo, Lemongrease.

125
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:14,944
We're gonna live here at
Lemongrabs now.

126
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:16,040
Yes.

127
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:20,249
I'm Jamaica, and this is
Toughy and Blombo.

128
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,655
Blombo, what is that?

129
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:25,216
- What?
- On Blombo's ears?

130
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,762
That's his headphones.

131
00:05:26,818 --> 00:05:28,798
Blombo, take them off!

132
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:32,825
Blombo!
You must heed my instructions!

133
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,495
<i>Take off your things!</i>

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,302
Whoa, settle down, Lemongrease.

135
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:39,308
I am not grease!

136
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:42,574
This is unacceptable!

137
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,580
What? What's going on?

138
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,949
All unfit citizens of
Lemongrab must be reconditioned!

139
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:50,919
Man, are you crazy?

140
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:54,925
Yo-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u!

141
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:58,589
M-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e!

142
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:01,656
I have to use
my sound sword now!

143
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:08,733
You guys.

144
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:10,605
What -- where are we?

145
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:13,943
You are in my reconditioning chamber.

146
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:17,609
You will receive four to three
units of juice now.

147
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:24,455
Ooh-ah!

148
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:27,461
♪ Crunchy. Wake up, Crunchy ♪

149
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:32,330
Eh? Glob, is that you?

150
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:34,335
No sign of Lemongrab for three days.

151
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,336
I think it worked.

152
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:38,373
Maybe.
Let's keep looking.

153
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:42,578
Aw, geez.

154
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:48,013
Hey!
- Huh?

155
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:50,313
What happened to
your new citizens?

156
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,582
They didn't understand
my Lemonstylz.

157
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:54,248
I like this way better.

158
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:57,122
<i>Hmm... I wonder if
maybe you don't understand</i>

159
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:59,092
<i>their Candy stylz.</i>

160
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,961
Come on!
Let me show you something.

161
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,491
You see, Earl, candy people
are mad special.

162
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:10,098
They need constant stroking
and snuggling.

163
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,619
Here, you try.

164
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:24,788
Ha-ha, ha!
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha!

165
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:28,793
Goo-goo, uh, g-goo!

166
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:38,562
Put you in my oven!

167
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:40,766
Nyah! It's gross!

168
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:43,537
And who says
your Way's right, anyway?

169
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,045
I look in the Lemonheart
you gave me

170
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,274
and see my Lemonway to act,

171
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,340
and that must be right!

172
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,756
Man, that guy's a real d-list.

173
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:01,659
Oh, dear. His candy citizens!

174
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:03,562
Let's crush this mess all accordingly!

175
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,225
Crazy light-bulb freestyle!

176
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:06,290
Yeah!

177
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:08,894
No. He's my responsibility.

178
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,768
I have to try to help him.

179
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:13,639
- Okay, that's cool, too.
- Hop on.

180
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:14,642
Hup!

181
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:21,811
Lemongrab?

182
00:08:21,873 --> 00:08:23,285
Lemongrab?

183
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,820
No Lemongrab.

184
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:27,187
Come on.
Let's find the Pup Gang quick.

185
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:31,985
Wait. I have a plan.
You guys go on ahead.

186
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:33,395
Okay, cool.

187
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:36,800
Hmm.

188
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:40,701
What do you got, Jake?

189
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,367
Just an empty room with a Catcher's mitt.

190
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,241
Weird.

191
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,112
Oh. Oh, no!

192
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,275
Oh! Ah!
Goonie-goo-goo-foofie!

193
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,581
Kooky-kooky-kooky!

194
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:59,885
This is serious!

195
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:02,553
Pup Gang got four units.

196
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:06,226
Maybe... maybe 10 units for trespassers!

197
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,376
You got tricks, huh?

198
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:17,378
Got to fall down sometime,

199
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,381
and when you do...

200
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:21,849
12 units!

201
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:23,851
Lemongrab, stop!

202
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:24,851
Huh?

203
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:27,354
Please, Earl.
I can help you.

204
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,688
No! No!
No more helping!

205
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:33,251
You're the one
who made me this way!

206
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:35,422
How can you help?!

207
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:38,433
You unload your punkest
boys on me?

208
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:41,596
You try to change my ways.

209
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,039
You poison!
You poison!

210
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:47,201
You need reconditioning!

211
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:49,871
Reconditio-o-o-o-n!

212
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:52,211
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

213
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:57,187
Yo-u-u-u-u!

214
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:59,849
N-o-o-o!

215
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,251
Whoa, whoa. What the hey?

216
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:08,698
Wait, Lemongrab.
Look!

217
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:10,702
Hello?

218
00:10:10,758 --> 00:10:12,704
Am I in the right room?

219
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,501
Huh? What?

220
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:16,701
Who's this rigmarole?

221
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:19,439
- I'm Lemongrab.
- Oh.

222
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:22,277
I made him for you
in your pantry,

223
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:23,941
for you to be with.

224
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:26,612
Two L-Lemongrabs?

225
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:28,848
Hmm?

226
00:10:36,952 --> 00:10:38,397
Hmm.

227
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:39,991
Yeah, okay!

228
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,125
Yeah!

229
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:47,266
All in favor of pardoning
the prisoners?

230
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,536
Aye!

231
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:51,204
Pardons for all!

232
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:53,476
Goodbye, Lemongrabs! Goodbye!

233
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:54,949
Take care, boys!

234
00:10:55,006 --> 00:10:58,078
Yes. Yes, indeed.
Ha ha!

235
00:10:58,142 --> 00:11:00,588
A lemon gives by taking.

236
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:03,421
And cares by yelling.

237
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,552
- Hmm!
- Hmm!

238
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:09,223
Well, okay!
Stop by anytime!

239
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:11,165
But call first!

240
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:13,067
Yes, goodbye!
