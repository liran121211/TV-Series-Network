1
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,686
What you building?

2
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,751
Um, it's just a little
stick fort.

3
00:00:42,828 --> 00:00:43,658
Oh, rad.

4
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,062
Look.
It's just my size.

5
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:51,703
Hey, get away from my fort,
you big, stinky monster!

6
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:53,966
I like it when you get
small, Jake.

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,132
Yeah, me too.

8
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:57,471
Whoa!

9
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:59,477
Whoa!
Peppermint Butler?

10
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:03,538
Finn, Jake, the princess
wants to see you.

11
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:05,675
As princess of Candy Kingdom,

12
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:09,812
I'm in charge of
a lot of candy people.

13
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:12,016
They rely on me.

14
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:16,289
I can't imagine what might
happen to them if I was gone.

15
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:20,492
And after my brush with death at
the hands of the lich,

16
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,864
I realized something.

17
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:26,200
I'm not gonna live forever,
Finn.

18
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,605
I would if I could.

19
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:33,611
But modern science
just isn't there yet,

20
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:37,979
so I engineered a replacement
who can live forever.

21
00:01:39,685 --> 00:01:43,519
I call her Goliad.

22
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:46,922
Aw, she's cute.

23
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:50,994
- Hi, Goliad. I'm Finn.
- And I'm Jake.

24
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:53,691
Hi, Finn. Hi, Jake.

25
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,097
- Hi, Goliad.
- Hi, Finn.

26
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,964
What did you use to
make her?

27
00:01:57,036 --> 00:02:00,904
Oh, um, pretty standard
candy-creature soup.

28
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:06,105
Some amino acids.

29
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:09,306
Some algebra.

30
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:12,351
And I threw in
one of my baby teeth

31
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:16,013
so she'd have my DNA.

32
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:19,080
Whoa, DNA?!

33
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:23,492
Yeah. All it takes
is just one little tooth.

34
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:26,998
Or... a single hair.

35
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:30,331
It's a-a-a-all it takes.

36
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:36,070
Princess Bubblegum,
are you okay?

37
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:38,076
Yeah! I'm good!

38
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:40,578
Haven't slept for a solid
83 hours, but...

39
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:43,114
Yeah, I'm good.

40
00:02:43,182 --> 00:02:45,173
Oh, you should
go to bed.

41
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:46,843
I can't go to bed.

42
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:51,219
Goliad has huge,
mondo mama brains.

43
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,690
I still need to fill them
with knowledge...

44
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,387
On how to rule a kingdom.

45
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:58,487
What? Let us teach her.

46
00:02:58,564 --> 00:03:00,327
Uh, okay.

47
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,832
I guess that would be
all right.

48
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:02,925
Yes!

49
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:05,596
Teachers!
Teaching teachers!

50
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:08,606
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

51
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,073
Come on, Goliad.

52
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:12,736
See you later, Princess!
Get some sleep.

53
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:14,143
Wh... hum? Hmm?

54
00:03:14,213 --> 00:03:15,475
Huh?

55
00:03:15,548 --> 00:03:17,015
Bye, guys.

56
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,881
Look, Goliad.
This is a preschool.

57
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:21,852
I'm gonna go set up some
obstacles and all that

58
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:23,320
for you to learn on.
- Mm.

59
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,550
- Is that okay?
- Yes. Thanks, Finn.

60
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,558
I'm excited to learn.

61
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:28,854
Okay. Great.

62
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:30,520
Jake, you go and get some kids
from inside

63
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:32,188
to help with the lesson
and such.

64
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:33,731
Okay.
Come on, Goliad.

65
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,097
Yes, Jake.

66
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,200
Um, hmm.

67
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:44,032
Uhh...

68
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:48,778
Rotten, stinkin', jerkin'...

69
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:51,478
Whaaa! Ohh!

70
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,949
Rah! Rah! Rah!

71
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:58,321
Now, now. Settle down.

72
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,292
Jake, these kids
seem pretty scary.

73
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:04,795
Oh, no.
These kids ain't nothing.

74
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:06,832
Kids croove doozyploon!

75
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:08,594
Check this out.

76
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,328
Hey, there, kids.
Who wants to play...

77
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:11,835
- Get him!
- Get that stink!

78
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,270
Uh, easy now, children.

79
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,069
Get the brain!

80
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:19,908
Get in his brain!

81
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:22,470
Get in his eyes!

82
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:30,082
Listen up! You kids better
stop donkin' around!

83
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:32,181
You're gonna mess up Goliad!

84
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,290
It's my way or the highway,
get it?

85
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:38,455
I'm Don Juan Cherry Tempo!

86
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,965
Now march, glib blobbit!

87
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:44,366
Don't be acting all crazy.

88
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:46,233
Whoa, holy shmow!

89
00:04:46,305 --> 00:04:48,899
Oh, hey.
Y'all are just in time.

90
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:51,442
You ready to pop this croc's
back, Dr. Goliad?

91
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,444
Yeah, I think so, Finn.

92
00:04:53,512 --> 00:04:56,174
I've learned a real lot already,
so far.

93
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:59,183
<i>So much...</i>

94
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:00,479
from Jake.

95
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:02,851
Yeah, you know, Finn,
maybe this isn't

96
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:05,117
such a good
idea, actually.

97
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:06,749
Oh, no. It's cool.

98
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:08,760
I got helmets for everybody.

99
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:11,092
Okay, Goliad.
You ready to lead?

100
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:12,221
Ready.

101
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:13,595
Okay.

102
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,100
In 3, 2, 1.
Go!

103
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:17,499
All right, listen up!

104
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,504
You kids better stop
donkin' around

105
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:20,971
and get up that ramp!

106
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,405
You're gonna mess up Goliad!

107
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:26,433
I'm Don Jon Cherry Temp...
Cherry Tempo!

108
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:28,605
It's my way or the highway,
glob globbit!

109
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,878
Stop, stop!

110
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:34,317
No, Goliad, no!

111
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:36,320
Leading isn't about
scaring people.

112
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:38,322
You got to stay calm
and use your head.

113
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,324
Use that beautiful brain,
girlfriend.

114
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:42,622
My brain? Are you sure?

115
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:46,426
Yeah. Don't be shy.
Try it on me. Lead me.

116
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,056
Okay, Finn.

117
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,623
Okay.

118
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:54,696
Hmm.

119
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,281
No, Goliad.
That's wrong, too.

120
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:13,291
You can't just control people
or whatever.

121
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,587
It's messed up.

122
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,890
No, Finn. This way's good.

123
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:19,055
Everyone did what I wanted...

124
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:21,531
really fast, no mistakes,

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,568
calm, like you said.

126
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:26,400
This definitely is
the way to lead.

127
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:28,167
Definitely.

128
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,538
Uh, no, no.

129
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,406
Wait. Is that true? Hmm.

130
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:34,105
Come on, Goliad.

131
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:36,511
Let's go see
Princess Bubblegum.

132
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:37,571
Princess!

133
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,242
Goliad's got mind-control
powers!

134
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:41,013
She got the wrong idea
about leadership.

135
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:43,281
Oh, I was afraid
this might happen.

136
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:44,982
Where is she now?

137
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:47,116
We left her outside
in the garden!

138
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,484
Hello, Goliad.

139
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:52,325
Hello, Princess.

140
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:54,389
I hear you learned
a lot today.

141
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:56,525
Yes. I led the children.

142
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:59,969
But Finn said you
used yelling and mind control.

143
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,631
Yes. It was good.

144
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:04,801
Goliad, let me tell you
something about leadership.

145
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:07,004
You see this fat bee?

146
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,240
She gets pollen
from this flower,

147
00:07:09,315 --> 00:07:11,249
but she's gentle

148
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:14,184
and makes the flower happy
and pollinated.

149
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:16,653
They both get what they need,

150
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:19,316
and that's how
a leader should be.

151
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:22,986
No, Princess.
Bee cares not for flower.

152
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:26,031
If getting pollen hurts
or kills flower,

153
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:28,032
bee would not care.

154
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,364
Bee is stronger than flower.

155
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:35,400
Goliad is stronger
than bee.

156
00:07:35,474 --> 00:07:38,500
Goliad is stronger than all.

157
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:40,972
Oh, no.

158
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:43,310
She's too far gone...
too corrupted.

159
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:46,510
If we're not careful, she could
throw an ultra-tantrum

160
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:48,553
and whang the castle apart.

161
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,214
I'll have to disassemble her
and try again.

162
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,349
No, Princess.

163
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:56,417
This is my castle now.

164
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,198
Don't worry, Princess.
We'll stop her.

165
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:05,202
No, Finn.
Here's the plan.

166
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,568
I'm going to build another
candy sphinx in my lab.

167
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,369
It's the only thing that could
possibly match her.

168
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,535
Just keep her busy
'til I return,

169
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,579
and don't think about
the plan!

170
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:16,978
She can read your minds!

171
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,785
Ohhh!

172
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:28,591
Whoa!

173
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:35,396
Ugh, that eyeball.

174
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:38,300
Just tuck that eyeball back
in its hole.

175
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:46,411
Goliad, no!

176
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,478
Ugh.

177
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:55,817
Jake! Don't swallow!

178
00:08:57,456 --> 00:09:01,085
Uh, you're in Finn's bubble.

179
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,094
Don't think about
the plan.

180
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:05,892
Think of something else.
Think of something else.

181
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,488
Don't worry, Princess,
we'll stop her.

182
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:08,430
No, no!

183
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,263
No, Finn.
She's ohhh...

184
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:18,565
Anyway, like I was saying,
she's far too powerful-I-I-I...

185
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:19,941
Ugh! Unhhh!

186
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:23,413
Aah!

187
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:26,007
Finn, she's far too powerful.
Here's the pl...

188
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:27,609
Argh.

189
00:09:27,686 --> 00:09:30,280
♪ I'm a buff baby that
can dance like a man ♪

190
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:36,055
♪ I can shake-a my fanny, I can
shake-a my... waahhh!

191
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:37,755
Here's the plan.

192
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,856
- No!
- I'm going to...

193
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,595
Goliad, no!

194
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,910
Wait, brother.
Why must we fight?

195
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,540
Rule with me!

196
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:00,107
No, brother.
Don't you see?

197
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:01,709
They're turning us against...

198
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:05,188
So be it.

199
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:06,849
Finn, are you
okay?

200
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:09,086
Yeah.
That dude saved me.

201
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:11,857
That's Stormo,
Goliad's new brother.

202
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,830
Well, what are they
doing now?

203
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,197
They're about to
have a psychic showdown.

204
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,544
Whoa, man!

205
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:28,944
So, like, I guess they're so
evenly matched

206
00:10:29,014 --> 00:10:31,608
that it's a stale...
blaghhh!

207
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:33,981
It's a stale...
flughhhh!

208
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:35,644
Ughh, blah!

209
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:38,053
They're so evenly
matched that it's a stalemate.

210
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:39,784
Yes.

211
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:41,018
Stormo sacrificed himself

212
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:43,254
to keep Goliad in check
for all eternity.

213
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:46,354
Well, that's pretty cool,
but I don't understand.

214
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:48,365
If Goliad and Stormo
are the same,

215
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,094
how come Stormo is
a good guy?

216
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:52,034
Oh, that's simple.

217
00:10:52,104 --> 00:10:55,039
I used some of your heroic DNA
in Stormo's recipe

218
00:10:55,107 --> 00:10:58,099
and not Goliad's.

219
00:10:58,177 --> 00:10:59,974
Oh. Whoa.

220
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:03,845
So, that means Stormo is,
like, my son?

221
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,908
Well, yeah,
in a way.

222
00:11:08,787 --> 00:11:13,053
Happy birthday, Stormo.
