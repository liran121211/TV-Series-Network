1
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:39,919
Jake, if I beat you,

2
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:42,323
you have to call me "sensei"
for a month.

3
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:43,916
Deal.

4
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:45,858
Hi, guys.

5
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:47,985
'Sup, Turtle Princess?

6
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:51,925
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Argh!

7
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,860
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

8
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,896
Get your hands off me,
Steven!

9
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:56,794
Yah!

10
00:00:56,863 --> 00:00:59,421
You too, Chad!

11
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:01,862
Hey, girl.

12
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,955
Hey, girl.

13
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,499
Brought you some
little fruit pies.

14
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,624
Awesome.

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,428
How you doing out here?

16
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:11,160
Turtle Princess,
the men out here

17
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:12,564
will not leave me alone!

18
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:14,568
It must be nice.

19
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:16,465
Nah, it's horrible.

20
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,025
They just want me
for my lumps.

21
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:22,764
These lumps aren't for sale,
Billy!

22
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:24,065
Ugh!

23
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:27,003
Aren't you sick of men going
after your turtle lumps?

24
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:30,938
Actually, I've never been
able to work my T-Lumps.

25
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:33,633
I just know
what I read in books.

26
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:38,371
Hey, you should write a book
telling me how to do it.

27
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:39,430
Oh, my glob.

28
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:41,532
Turtle Princess,
I always wanted

29
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:43,940
to write trashy books
for ladies!

30
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,109
Hyah!
Back up off me, Ricky!

31
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:51,668
Yeah, everyone needs to know
that when I work these lumps,

32
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,679
no man is immune
to their influence.

33
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:00,037
Jake's ball landed over
here, Beemo!

34
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:02,808
Lsp, Finn would be perfect

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,144
as the test subject
for your lump studies.

36
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:09,572
Yay! I win!

37
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,446
Bow to your sensei.

38
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:12,676
Aw!

39
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,813
You got to go undercover

40
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:18,215
and conduct your lump science
on him.

41
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:22,117
Prove to the world that even
a white knight like Finn

42
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:26,245
is no match for the power
of your lumps.

43
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,617
I'll do it --
for the world!

44
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:30,177
And for you, girl.

45
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:31,244
Oh, girl!

46
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:45,719
Day one -- on my way to Finn
and Jake's.

47
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,816
Side note --
I look fresh to death

48
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:50,053
with my new dress
and purse.

49
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:52,458
Mm. Mm. Mm.

50
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,328
Hello?

51
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:02,364
Hey, Jake.

52
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,363
Is Finn home?

53
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,363
Ohh!

54
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:06,830
'Sup, Lsp?

55
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:09,229
Oh, hey. I'm answering that ad you put out

56
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,198
for the "Adventure Secretary."

57
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,130
What?

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,190
Ugh! Hold on. I'll get it.

59
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,929
Hold on. It's down in there.

60
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:19,468
Okay, wait. I got it.

61
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:20,626
Here you go.

62
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,396
"Wanted --
Adventure Secretary."

63
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,164
Smells like fruit pie.

64
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:28,068
It's nice of you to
want to be our secretary,

65
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:30,002
but we don't need one.

66
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,901
Dude, look at her.

67
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:34,461
Mmm. Oh, glob.

68
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:36,301
Yeah, it's sad.

69
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:39,341
Come on.
We got to help her.

70
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,567
Ah.

71
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:44,040
All right, Lsp, come inside.

72
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:45,632
Awesome.

73
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,175
Totally nailed the interview.

74
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,569
I'm gonna need
a secretary desk.

75
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:53,941
Rah!

76
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:03,073
I'm starving!
What's for dinner?!

77
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:05,613
Oh. Uh...

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,046
we got some...
blueberries.

79
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,809
Jake has saltines.

80
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:11,042
Yuck.

81
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:13,106
Looks like I'll have to bust out
these cobras

82
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:15,740
to get a better
dinner.

83
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:17,306
Hey, Finn.

84
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:20,647
<i>You got anything better to eat?</i>

85
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:23,947
Oh, cool --
old spaghetti.

86
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,350
I'm gonna go heat this up.

87
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,319
Chapter one --"Gotcha."

88
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:30,547
Have a good night.

89
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,643
See you in the morning.

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,745
Good night, you guys!

91
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:40,612
Finn is even more overpowered
by my lumps than I thought.

92
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,486
I guess at the end of the day,

93
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:44,353
it's all about the lumps.

94
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:46,289
Hey, girl. Hey --

95
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:48,882
<i>Hey, girl.</i>

96
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,449
Oh, Turtle Princess, this book
is coming out awesome!

97
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,517
<i>Oh, good, girl.
I can't wait to read it.</i>

98
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,323
Thanks, girl.

99
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,362
<i>- Good night, girl.
- Good night, girl.</i>

100
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,427
Huh? What's that?

101
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:10,692
'Sup, Lsp?

102
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:11,993
What are you guys doing?

103
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:14,396
We're carrying these
rocks on an adventure

104
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:17,365
up to the mystery mountains.

105
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:21,526
Oh, nuh-uh!
I am not gonna carry rocks!

106
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,262
That's okay.
Jake can carry them.

107
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:24,267
Yep.

108
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:27,201
Ugh! Fine.

109
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:29,259
You're welcome, Finn.

110
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:33,598
Ugh!

111
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:36,503
My arms weren't meant to carry
so many rocks, you guys.

112
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,436
Come on, Lsp.
You can make it.

113
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,768
Ugggggh!

114
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:41,831
Hey, girl. Hey --

115
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:45,303
Turtle Princess,
you can't call me.

116
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:46,840
You're gonna blow my cover!

117
00:05:46,907 --> 00:05:48,169
<i>Good morning, girl.</i>

118
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:49,469
Good morning, girl.

119
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,338
<i>Would you be mad at me
if I ask out Billy,</i>

120
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,400
<i>that vulture who was
hitting on you?</i>

121
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:56,171
<i>I think he's cute, and...</i>

122
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:57,370
Hey, Lsp, shake a leg.

123
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:58,467
Can't talk right now, girl.

124
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:07,271
The Loch of Phantoms.

125
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:10,542
Princess Bubblegum said
the rocks would show us

126
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:12,605
the safe path.

127
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:18,680
This is way too boring
for my book.

128
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:20,614
Oh! My shoulder strap!

129
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:23,617
Oh, my orange juice
is coming out!

130
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,914
Ha! Gotch--
huh?

131
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,275
Jake. "Kerploop!"

132
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:30,546
"Kerploop."

133
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:33,678
Not... gotcha?

134
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:38,482
All right!

135
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:59,260
Ughhh!
This place is plops, Finn!

136
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,419
We can meet you back
at the tree house later,

137
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:03,552
if you want.

138
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,391
That weird light.

139
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,095
Hey, Finn!
Finn, my dress is slipping!

140
00:07:13,164 --> 00:07:14,631
Huh?

141
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:16,495
Listen, Lsp, we gotta
be careful.

142
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:20,932
Whooooo!
My dress!

143
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:24,832
- No, Lsp! It's not safe!
- Aaah! Don't look!

144
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:28,392
He-e-e-e-e-y!

145
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:32,698
Oh.

146
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,566
Hey, Fi-i-i-nn.

147
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,932
She's stuck in there!

148
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:39,835
We gotta bust through
this wall!

149
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:44,865
I knew you couldn't
resist me, Finn.

150
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:49,436
Oh, lump.
I took it too far.

151
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:54,870
My powerful lumps have turned
Finn into a grody monster!

152
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:55,931
Get away, Finn!

153
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,272
Aah! No!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

154
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:00,310
Hyah!

155
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:03,004
Aah! I-I can't look!

156
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,746
Aah!

157
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:14,007
That was so crazy!
What just happened?!

158
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,275
Oh.

159
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:17,075
Um, Bubblegum sent us
on a quest

160
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:18,876
to destroy these
cursed mirrors.

161
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:20,643
Evil stuff happens
when you look into them.

162
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:21,648
Oh, glob.

163
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:23,945
<i>I had to look,
'cause I looked so good.</i>

164
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:28,178
Lsp, you don't need a mirror
to know you look good.

165
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:33,350
<i>You're beautiful
on the inside.</i>

166
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,943
Like...
your brain and stuff.

167
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,881
Thanks for saying that stuff.

168
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:41,080
And for saving me
from those mirror-yous.

169
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,020
That was pretty nice.

170
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,113
Okay, time to write.

171
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:49,157
Gonna make this...
trashy.

172
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:50,315
Turtle Princess will be all...

173
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,153
"Oh, my gosh!

174
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:53,952
Number-one best seller!"

175
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:56,219
Heh heh. Yeah.

176
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,654
What is he doing out there?

177
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:05,820
Sometimes,
after an adventure,

178
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:09,794
he likes to sit out there
and think.

179
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:11,090
Hey, girl. Hey --

180
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:14,261
- Hello?
- Hey, girl.

181
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,888
Are you almost done
with your book?

182
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:18,863
Oh!
I'm working on it.

183
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,956
I've been doing so much
research.

184
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:23,829
<i>Did Finn fall victim
to your lumps?</i>

185
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,866
Um... yeah.

186
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,163
<i>Great! Bring in your manuscript
right away.</i>

187
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:30,701
<i>Click!</i>

188
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:33,133
Yeah... a book
about how I'm hot

189
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:35,032
and Finn only wants --

190
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:37,660
he's so... hot.

191
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,503
Old spaghetti.

192
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:43,299
"Kerploop."

193
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,032
<i>You're beautiful
on the inside.</i>

194
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:49,198
Finn has the hottest lumps,

195
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:52,001
<i>but his lumps are
on the inside.</i>

196
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,734
Aaaargh!

197
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:56,604
He's great!

198
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,273
Uh... bye, Lsp.

199
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:20,237
This isn't what you said
it'd be about.

200
00:10:20,314 --> 00:10:21,508
I know. I --

201
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,344
I love it!

202
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,144
Oh, my glob!

203
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:39,675
Finn, you've probably been
wondering

204
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,812
where I've been
for the last few hours.

205
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:44,252
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, I have.

206
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:46,982
Finn, I was never really
your secretary, Finn.

207
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:48,249
I was writing a book

208
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:50,380
about how you were
a slave to my lumps

209
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:52,013
'cause I'm so hot, Finn!

210
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,351
Oh. Okay.

211
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:56,118
<i>But you're the one
who's hot, Finn!</i>

212
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,521
Wow. Uh... thanks!

213
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,991
<i>No. Thank you.</i>

214
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:06,750
Lsp, you're wearing
garbage for clothes!

215
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:08,919
Gotcha.

216
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:13,318
