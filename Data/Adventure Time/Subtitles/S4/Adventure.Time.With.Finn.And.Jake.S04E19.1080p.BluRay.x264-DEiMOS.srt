1
00:00:57,184 --> 00:01:00,292
My GPS shows Finn
and Jake over there.

2
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:03,304
I think that's where
the Ice King has them hostage.

3
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:06,409
I'm sure the boys are fine.

4
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:10,072
The Ice King isn't usually
a serious threat.

5
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:12,980
Besides, this'll be easy
with the two of us.

6
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,578
We've got science on our side.

7
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:17,590
Your tea is ready.

8
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:19,593
Pouring. Pouring.

9
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,011
It's okay, Lady.
Jake knows you love him.

10
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:42,118
Don't worry.
Just try to relax.

11
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:46,397
I'll work on my holo-entry.

12
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:48,934
It's been three weeks since Finn
and Jake disappeared

13
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,936
while battling the Ice King.

14
00:01:50,992 --> 00:01:54,497
I've activated a secret GPS
implanted in Finn's ear.

15
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:57,375
It has led us to an uncharted
black ice cave.

16
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:00,542
But I've spent hours calculating
every possible danger

17
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:02,210
and am well-prepared.

18
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:07,192
Then I'll pull out
my electrode gun.

19
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:13,267
Then I'll use
my ball-blam-burgler-ber!

20
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:17,296
Lady, it'll be fine.
We've got science!

21
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:57,151
Hmm, I suppose that's true.

22
00:02:57,217 --> 00:02:59,665
Let's roll.

23
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,747
Ugh, I can't get a signal
in this chamber.

24
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,755
Let's see if they show up
on my heart monitor.

25
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:22,388
Hmm.

26
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,897
There they are.

27
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,490
Through this sphincter.

28
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:47,430
Hold up, Lady.

29
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:56,945
No, no, no!!

30
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,710
Aah! Aah!

31
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,914
Don't worry, Lady.

32
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,117
Ball-blam-burgler-bler-ber!

33
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:11,890
My field of vision!

34
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,371
Hey!

35
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:25,716
Lady, phase through the wall!

36
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:34,358
Come on. There's no turning back now.

37
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:38,368
This is total bunk, you copier!

38
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:39,869
You're only in love with her

39
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:41,531
because Mn in love with her!

40
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,596
Ice King.

41
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:44,440
I've been playing this game

42
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,104
a lot longer than you, pal!

43
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:48,114
I've been working my moves,
smooth-talking her,

44
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,082
showing her magic tricks!

45
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,849
Don't ignore me!
Come back!

46
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:56,290
I'm picking up three heart signatures.

47
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:58,922
Ice king must be talking
to Finn and Jake.

48
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:08,374
Go to the right, Lady.

49
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:18,583
Aah! Ugh!

50
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,724
Ew.

51
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:59,144
Lady!

52
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:01,708
Lady, are you okay?

53
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,066
No, Lady, I won't leave you
while you're hurt.

54
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,834
Come on.

55
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,092
What are you playing at, Ice King?

56
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,631
Three heart signatures.

57
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,299
Getting closer.

58
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:46,505
Hey.

59
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:49,847
Princess.

60
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:53,081
What a pleasant surprise.

61
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:56,592
- Ricardio!
- Yes, it is I.

62
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,928
Did you find my dungeon stimulating?

63
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,627
Where are Finn and Jake?!

64
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,968
What do you see in those two?

65
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:06,666
A boy?

66
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,403
And a dog?

67
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:12,472
You deserve more
mature companionship.

68
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:15,246
Poisoned with Zanoits!

69
00:07:15,308 --> 00:07:18,723
You see, I thought I only
wanted your heart.

70
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,727
But I was wrong.

71
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:22,820
I was unfair to you.

72
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:24,832
I want...

73
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:28,166
the full package.

74
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:31,003
Princess...
- What?

75
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,441
I'm a man now.

76
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:42,222
I made myself this body
for you, Princess,

77
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,424
synthesized from
ice King's living tissue,

78
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:51,162
his bones broken and reassembled.

79
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:54,503
It hurt! Ooh, boy!
How about a hug?

80
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:57,134
Give me a hug! I need it!

81
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,544
Silence, Simon!

82
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:03,484
All for you, Princess.

83
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,955
Now marvel at these powerful,

84
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:10,986
articulate limbs!
- Stop!

85
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:15,969
Attached with supple
and delicate sinews.

86
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:19,874
Lady!

87
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,377
Now, my darling,

88
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:25,143
we can finally be united...

89
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,877
as man...

90
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,922
and wife.

91
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:34,324
Okay, Ricardio.

92
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:37,560
I'll do it.
I'll be your wife.

93
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:40,729
- Ah!
- If you can beat me...

94
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:44,003
at hand-to-hand combat!

95
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:47,946
Oh, my!
How Valkyrian!

96
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:51,747
Princess, you are absolut- oh!

97
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,078
You think we're intellectual equals?

98
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:15,084
It only took me seconds

99
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,087
to get you off your guard!

100
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:19,146
And this "body" you designed

101
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:21,660
is self-congratulatory garbage!

102
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:23,526
See, I know a thing or two

103
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:25,534
about building a body
out of biomass,

104
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,865
and you don?' leave

105
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,428
your heart exposed!

106
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:33,068
I just wanted to impress you.

107
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,841
You didn't.

108
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:40,048
Get out of my sight.

109
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:54,535
Princess?

110
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,200
Princess!
Ricardio is back!

111
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:58,472
He's in the black ice cave, and
he's peacocking hardcore!

112
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:01,312
I know. And he poisoned
you both with Zanoits.

113
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:02,976
But I took care of it.

114
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,214
What happened?
How did we get here?

115
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:07,383
I dragged you all here
on Lady's back.

116
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:09,050
It took two days.

117
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:11,722
And another day to make you guys
an antidote.

118
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,393
And 15 minutes to build
the Ice King a new heart.

119
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:15,799
Hey, Finn.

120
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,407
I made it out of Ricardio's sinews,

121
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:21,306
and some toffee and maracas.

122
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:27,146
Coochie-ooochie-coochie!

123
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:28,984
I'm glad you guys are up.

124
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,818
Please make the Ice King leave.

125
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:33,121
Shooka-shooka-shooka!

126
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:37,733
Ice King, please leave!!

127
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:42,035
How are you feeling, Lady?

128
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:46,044
Yes, he's awake.

129
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,050
Oh, Lady, I should have never
put you in danger.

130
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:51,881
I saw on the heart monitor.

131
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:53,386
I didn't know.

132
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:59,296
- Hee-hee-hee!
- Jake!

133
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:01,628
Lady! Oh, Lady!

134
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:08,971
I am pregnant!

135
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:11,342
I'm puppies!?
