1
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:27,694
The Lich

2
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:46,449
Dark times are coming.

3
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:56,179
You talk like justice, Billy,

4
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,422
but you can't kick a plane.

5
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:16,844
Are you alright buddy?

6
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:18,943
Another nightmare?

7
00:01:19,589 --> 00:01:23,291
Yeah, that dang snail again, man,
monkeying it up again.

8
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:25,345
But, there were other
guys this time too.

9
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:27,763
The bear was there, and some dogs,

10
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:29,726
and Billy's lady, and Billy.

11
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:32,292
And Billy was really scared
of something fierce, man.

12
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,885
Something real fierce.

13
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:36,626
And the cosmic owl was
there too, kind of,

14
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:37,901
screeching it up.

15
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,423
Whoa, the cosmic owl?

16
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:42,812
What if that was a
premonition dream, Finn?

17
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:43,907
Do you think?

18
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:44,682
Could be.

19
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:47,675
We better go tell Billy
about it, just in case.

20
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:48,959
He'll know what to do.

21
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:51,272
Dang. Whoa.

22
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:53,573
I dreamt I was in kindergarten again,

23
00:01:53,574 --> 00:01:56,756
but I had really big feet,
and was also the teacher.

24
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,767
Come on. We better hurry.

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,433
Hello?

26
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:09,853
Billy?

27
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:13,240
Billy, wake up!

28
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:15,495
What the heck are you
guys doing in my crack?

29
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:17,551
It's three o'clock in the morning!

30
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:19,784
Oh, you know, just
dropped by to say hello.

31
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:24,752
See what you've been uh...
up to, what uh...

32
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:27,340
How are these days?

33
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,972
We came to see if you're dead.

34
00:02:29,013 --> 00:02:31,089
What? Why would I be dead?

35
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:34,258
Yeah, stupid...

36
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:37,869
I had a dream about a bear,
and an old lady, and a snail,

37
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,111
and you were there, and the snail
killed you or something.

38
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,305
Was the cosmic owl there?

39
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:48,403
Yeah, on tv. Does that count?

40
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:52,720
Your dreams are omen
of grave significance.

41
00:02:57,621 --> 00:02:59,474
- Finn?
- Yeah?

42
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:03,570
Are you ready to come with me on a
mission to save all life from The Lich?

43
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:06,092
Yes.

44
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,341
Wait. So, we have to snatch the gems
out of all the crowns of power?

45
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:12,793
- That's right.
- Cool.

46
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:17,207
Why do we have to snatch 'em?
Can't we just ask 'em for 'em?

47
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:20,881
No time. The faith of the
world hangs in the balance.

48
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:22,732
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

49
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:34,462
"I suck hamburgers"

50
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:05,961
- Are you sure that's a gem?
- I think so.

51
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:13,162
It's so deep.

52
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:16,641
Gross.

53
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:39,738
Man, we got so many gems. This is crazy.

54
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,313
Hey, Billy, how many gems
we still need to get?

55
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:45,084
Two? One?

56
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,402
Wait, two or one?

57
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,670
I want candy.

58
00:04:57,671 --> 00:04:59,186
You got anything in the saddle bag?

59
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:00,428
Get out of there!

60
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,708
The Enchiridion? How did you get this?

61
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:07,339
I found it in the mouth of a bear.

62
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:09,649
A bear?

63
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:15,206
This book is really important.
It has magical powers.

64
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:17,784
Turn the little sword sideways.

65
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:37,241
Cool!

66
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,919
What is this stuff?

67
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Hold on.

68
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,050
Hello, my name is Booko.

69
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,705
What you see here is
the map of the multiverse.

70
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:52,982
It shows all the known dimensions
and the links between each of them.

71
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:55,836
This is the dimension that contains the
universe in which we currently reside.

72
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:56,837
Enhance!

73
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,218
Make it stop!

74
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,414
Anyway, at the center of the
multiverse there's a dimension

75
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:12,045
called the time room, believed to be
the quasi-corporeal dwelling place

76
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:13,206
of the almighty Prismo.

77
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,502
The time room is a single dimension
that exists outside of time.

78
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:18,329
The time room produces the time waves
that are experienced by the dimensions.

79
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,856
Some dimensions have permanent
links that allow travel to and fro,

80
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:23,624
others become linked temporarily
by naturally forming wormholes,

81
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,323
and others can become linked
artificially by magical portals

82
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:28,145
torn open by items of great power.

83
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,605
Once the last gem is inserted into
the Enchiridion it will have the power

84
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,416
to create a portal to any
dimension in the multiverse.

85
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:36,849
An activated portal creates a
time dilation in which either end

86
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,607
of the portal experiences a temporal
synchronization allowing for the

87
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:43,469
safe passing of particles through a
non local region of space-time.

88
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:46,891
I'm gonna push the Lich in there.

89
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,922
Oh, cool!

90
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:50,976
Let's go get that gem!

91
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,435
Yeah!

92
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:06,218
Hi!

93
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:24,590
Who's there?

94
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:29,767
Princess! Princess!
I need the gem from your crown.

95
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:31,891
What the junk? No!

96
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,585
Get off!

97
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,373
Get off of me!

98
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:47,461
That was an accident.

99
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,511
Finn , stop!

100
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:17,462
Hurry!

101
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,366
Finn, stop!

102
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,333
That's not Billy! It's the Lich!

103
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,125
Lich alert! Lich alert!

104
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:33,438
Billy!

105
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,211
Billy?

106
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,843
The book, Finn. Give me the book.

107
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,775
Quickly, child, we're
running out of time!

108
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,334
Lich! You... you messed Billy up!

109
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:57,767
You just wanna mess me all up.

110
00:08:58,091 --> 00:08:59,634
Mess everyone up.

111
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:01,519
You tricked me!

112
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:05,974
No, child, it's all true.
The book has great power.

113
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,212
I can make you live forever.
Anything you want.

114
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:12,679
Just give me that book!

115
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:17,398
No, no, no!

116
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:18,600
No more tricks!

117
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:20,669
You'll never get this book!

118
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:23,847
No!

119
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:44,359
Oh, no! Finn! What did you do?

120
00:09:47,215 --> 00:09:48,603
What?

121
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,192
Thanks, Finn.

122
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,318
I couldn't have done it without you.

123
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:57,278
Jake, stop him!

124
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,983
Don't let him through that portal!

125
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,379
Hang on, Jake!

126
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:19,950
What now, princess?

127
00:10:24,544 --> 00:10:25,777
Hold on, Jake!

128
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,413
Finn!

129
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:53,599
Finn, would you come in here please?

130
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,953
Hurry! It's very important!

131
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:57,579
Coming, mom!

132
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,577
Man, she sounds steamed.

133
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:01,842
Guess I done dung
something up yet again.

134
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:03,495
Come on, Jake.
