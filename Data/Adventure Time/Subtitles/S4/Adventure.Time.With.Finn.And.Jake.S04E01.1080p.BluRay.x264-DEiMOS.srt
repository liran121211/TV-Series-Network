<i>Who was that?</i>

10
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:47,703
The Princess of the Fire Kingdom.

11
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:49,602
Dude.

12
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:51,470
I think I have a crush.

13
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,031
What do you know
about her, Jake?

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,237
I was trying to help you get
over your Princess Bubblegum

15
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:57,303
sad times by
hooking you two up.

16
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:59,315
But she's evil, man.

17
00:00:59,383 --> 00:01:00,714
You shut your
dirty mouth!

18
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:02,752
Dirty?!

19
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:05,478
Huh.

20
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:06,579
No, really, man!

21
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:07,884
Her dad said she was evil!

22
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,983
Nah, man.

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,688
I peeped beyond
her burning gaze

24
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:16,324
and noshed hot
lunch with her soul.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,129
She ain't evil.

26
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:20,726
She's passionate.

27
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:22,271
Help me track her down.

28
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:23,704
Mmmmm...

29
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:24,763
Come on, man.

30
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,570
I really like her.
Help me out.

31
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:29,345
Jake.

32
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:31,176
Jake, help me out.

33
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:32,408
Help me out.

34
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:35,473
Jake.

35
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:37,918
Jake, help me!
Jake!

36
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:39,785
Jake, help me!!

37
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:42,450
Ye-e-e-e-a-ah, okay.

38
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:43,754
Whoo! All right!

39
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:48,362
<i>You sure you're not into
any other Princesses?</i>

40
00:01:48,432 --> 00:01:50,195
What about Wildberry Princess?

41
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,098
She's small and plump.

42
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:53,932
You could sleep on
her like a pillow.

43
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:55,437
Could be nice.

44
00:01:58,809 --> 00:01:59,776
Is that bird...

45
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:00,901
smoking?

46
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:02,774
Hey!
Don't you judge me!

47
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:05,406
It was that fire chick down
there that done this to me!

48
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:14,613
Oh!

49
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,732
Oh, Jake.
Look at her.

50
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:26,030
She's innocent...
like the steam off a puppy's nose

51
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,502
searching for
ham in the snow.

52
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:29,869
Guy drops one piece of ham in
the snow and he never hears

53
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,032
the end of it!

54
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:32,200
Snap out of it!

55
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,334
She's burning cute
little flowers!

56
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,571
Yeah.

57
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:37,909
<i>She is like a cute,
little flower.</i>

58
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,682
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

59
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:45,243
Oh, no!
Are you okay?

60
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:47,654
I-I was just
worried about you.

61
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:48,952
Huh?

62
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:50,583
Look, I-I'm sorry
about before.

63
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,287
I-I don't know what happened,
but I just...

64
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:53,454
I had to see
you again.

65
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,054
And I don't know, really...

66
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:56,622
I don't know anything
about you, but I just...

67
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,429
I really like you.

68
00:02:58,502 --> 00:03:00,333
You know, you're...
you're so...

69
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:02,030
beautiful.

70
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:05,230
Aaah!

71
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,142
Aah!

72
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:11,575
Ow!

73
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:12,546
Oh, glob!

74
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:13,583
Am I hurting you?

75
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,675
Yes!
That's all you've done!

76
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:19,351
<i>Are you trying to hurt me?</i>

77
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:20,889
Is that why you're
following me?!

78
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:22,390
I'm not following...

79
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,051
<i>Well, I guess technically
I am following you...</i>

80
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,561
Hey! No! Wait!

81
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,926
<i>I guess now I'm
technically chasing you.</i>

82
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,260
Finn!

83
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:41,935
Hold on!

84
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:44,072
Ow!

85
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:46,707
Toasty buns!

86
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:50,146
Where are you?!

87
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,744
I want to chat it up with you!

88
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,220
Oh, we lost her!

89
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,053
Whoa.

90
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,562
I am ambushing you!

91
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,494
Rrah!

92
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:02,793
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

93
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:03,924
Whoa!

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,024
Whoa!

95
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:07,001
Hey, I like your fireballs.

96
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,162
Huh?

97
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:09,762
Why do you torment me?!

98
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,033
<i>I'm not trying to!</i>

99
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:12,472
I just like you.

100
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,737
<i>I think I...
I think I like like you.</i>

101
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:18,747
Listen, when I look at you,
my brain goes all stupid,

102
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,375
and I just want to hug you
and sit on the couch and...

103
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:22,679
and play Beemo with you.

104
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,151
I can't explain why, but...

105
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,688
I've never felt this way,
and I think we should be together.

106
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:27,856
I...

107
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,663
Yeah!

108
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,497
Ugh! Enough!

109
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,402
You should not toy with the
emotions of a fire elemental.

110
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:43,302
Wait! Wait!

111
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:44,738
I really didn't...

112
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:48,244
You told me you liked me, and
you made my flame grow brighter.

113
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:50,142
But then you put me out...

114
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,578
Which hurt!

115
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:52,706
Gyah!

116
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:55,410
You're trying to impede me.

117
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:56,952
That must be your purpose.

118
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,511
But fire's purpose is to burn.

119
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:03,582
<i>So I'm going to turn this
land into my fire kingdom!</i>

120
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,786
No!

121
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:08,194
Ooh! Ow! Hot! Hot!

122
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,731
She's headed for the
Goblin Kingdom!

123
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,326
We need to defeat
this fiery she-beast!

124
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:15,701
I can't fight her, man.

125
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:16,864
I'm still into her.

126
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,907
Finn!

127
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:19,100
What's more important...

128
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:20,972
your love for that
screwball dame

129
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:24,411
or being a hero and saving the
lives of innocent goblin folk?

130
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,480
Being a hero.

131
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,177
All right! Come on!

132
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:31,812
Let's go build fireproof suits!

133
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:36,725
I got to get back to her!

134
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:39,921
Dude, slow down, or your
fire suit will be junk.

135
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:41,190
Ooh!

136
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:43,061
Is bags of old
bread fireproof?

137
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:43,963
Jake!

138
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,661
You found Neptr!

139
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:48,465
I am the ultimate
hide-and-seek champion.

140
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:53,601
15 months, 4 days, 9 hours,
and you guys did not find me.

141
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:58,106
Oh, plops.

142
00:05:58,181 --> 00:05:59,239
We forgot about the game.

143
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,408
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

144
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:02,314
I missed you, creator.

145
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:05,013
And we missed you, too,
but, Neptr, right now, we need you to...

146
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,682
<i>To count to 100
while you hide?</i>

147
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:11,352
One, two, three, four, five...

148
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:12,554
Neptr.

149
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:14,597
Will you help us
build fireproof suits?

150
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:19,158

We're coming up on
the Goblin Kingdom!

168
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,945
There she is.

169
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:12,616
She seems okay.

170
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:13,713
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

171
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,984
Wood for sale!

Wood on fire for sale!

It's really starting
to come together.

174
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:21,327
Needs more...

175
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:22,592
fire.

176
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:23,893
Hmmmm.

177
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,457
- Flame Princess!
- Huh?

178
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:27,730
Listen, you got to stop
burning the Goblin Kingdom.

179
00:07:27,804 --> 00:07:29,567
But I don't want to fight you...
or hurt you.

180
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,833
I swear!

181
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:33,432
I've heard this all before.

182
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,854
You meanie!

183
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:47,685
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

184
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:49,054
My cart!

185
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,683
<i>I was born in that cart!</i>

186
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:52,660
I'll put it out!

187
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,856
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Aah!

188
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,023
Aaaah!

189
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,191
Jake didn't mean that!

190
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,701
Ook!

191
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:00,895
I need your help, Finn!

192
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,028
This one's too big!

193
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:04,534
Aah!

194
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,699
Why-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y?!

195
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:06,639
No, Jake, stop!

196
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:07,641
You're hurting her!

197
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,541
I will solve this, creator.

198
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:14,276
I will extinguish her using
our suit's foam blaster.

199
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,908
Hold still, burning lady.

200
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:16,917
Wha...?

201
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:18,544
Locked on target.

202
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:19,815
No, Neptr!

203
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,015
Yes, creator.

204
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,422
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

205
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:25,654
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

206
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:26,695
I'm sorry!

207
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:28,355
Whoa!

208
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,894
That is the last
time you hurt me.

209
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,598
Rrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

210
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:37,640
My bad, Jake!

211
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:39,004
Turn it off, Neptr!

212
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,643
Oh, my.

213
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:47,544
N-o-o-o-o!

214
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:50,211
Rrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

215
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:51,776
No more! No more!!

216
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:58,488
Flame Princess!

217
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:02,392
I can't fight her.

218
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:04,695
But... but I can't let
her destroy the city.

219
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,359
I've failed everyone.

220
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:07,926
Not true, creator.

221
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:09,733
You haven't failed Neptr.

222
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:13,867
<i>Even if everyone burns,
you'll still have me, creator.</i>

223
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:27,948
Mmm!

224
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,218
No.

225
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,886
Why can't I just like a girl?

226
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:37,225
Ow!

227
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,734
Huh?

228
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:50,173
Oh!

229
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,421
Did I... do something... cool
while I was knocked out?

230
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,355
I understand now.

231
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:04,518
<i>You're a water elemental.</i>

232
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:05,561
What?!

233
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:06,822
You're my opposite.

234
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:08,625
You create water.

235
00:10:08,698 --> 00:10:10,165
What? Cry?
No, I ju...

236
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,325
Yeah.

237
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,164
You cry and cry all the time.

238
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:14,396
N-no! No!

239
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,869
I-I-I don't
usually do that.

240
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:17,270
That's your power.

241
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,637
No! No-no-no-no-no-no!

242
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,642
Finn, even if we
like each other,

243
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,644
we're going to
hurt each other.

244
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:24,270
No!
W-we don't have to!

245
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:25,939
I can take it.

246
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:28,677
I-I mean, can't we try?

247
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:31,117
You would defy nature for me?

248
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:33,121
Uh... yeah.

249
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:34,781
Whatevs.

250
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:39,622
Aah.

251
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:41,323
Bye, Finn.

252
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:43,160
Goodbye, Lady.

253
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:46,827
Finn! Oh, my glob, man!

254
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:48,268
Everyone's dead, man!

255
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:50,306
They're all burned!

256
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:52,841
There's barbecued
bods everywhere!

257
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:54,274
Wha-a-a-t?!

258
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:55,606
I'm just kidding.

259
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:57,578
I saved them.
Everyone's fine.

260
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:58,841
See?

261
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,905
Yeah, we're alive.

262
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:03,817
So, how'd everything
go with Flame Princess?

263
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:06,855
She hugged me,
then left.

264
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:08,151
Whoa!

265
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:10,249
How did it feel?

266
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:11,816
It hurt.
