1
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:11,718
Yo, beemo, you done
charging up that phone, or what?

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,353
Almost... finished.

3
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:18,454
Thanks, beemo.

4
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:20,620
All right, man.
We're gonna figure this out

5
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:24,556
right...Now.

6
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,356
<i>Yo, yo, yo, yo, check it!
This is Jake on my camera</i>

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,157
<i>phone!
Wh-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oa!</i>

8
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,158
<i>Whoa, whoa!
Yo, finn!</i>

9
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:35,326
<i>- Say hi to my new camera phone.
- What up, camera phone?</i>

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:37,827
<i>Lalalalalalalalalalala
lalalalalalalalalalalalalala...</i>

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,895
<i>...Lalalalalalalalalalalalala!</i>

12
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:43,196
<i>Marceline!
 You guys want to come party</i>

13
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:46,364
<i>in the nightosphere with me?
I'm visiting with my dad, and</i>

14
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:48,432
<i>- it's crazy boring.
- Whoa!</i>

15
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:51,532
<i>Wait a minute, marceline.
Last time I saw your dad, I</i>

16
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:54,734
<i>sliced open his soul sack.
 Oh, no, he's totally chill</i>

17
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:56,301
<i>- now.
- Okay, but I'm keeping</i>

18
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:58,667
<i>an eye out for your old man in
case he pulls any...</i>

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,070
<i>Sneak attacks.</i>

20
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,403
<i>Don't be a wiener dog.
Jake, you coming?</i>

21
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:07,172
<i>Whoo! Yeah, baby!</i>

22
00:01:07,173 --> 00:01:10,541
<i>All right, so...This is the
nightosphere, I guess.</i>

23
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,941
<i>It looks banaynays.
Marceline says they got tons of</i>

24
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:16,441
<i>crazy ways out here.</i>

25
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,810
<i>Right, marceline?</i>

26
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:24,412
<i>Marceline! Marcy!</i>

27
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:27,113
<i>There you are, marceline.</i>

28
00:01:27,114 --> 00:01:28,580
<i>Hmm?</i>

29
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:30,279
<i>- Rrragh!
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!</i>

30
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:34,349
<i>- Oh. Hello, dog. Hello, finn.
- Stay away from me,</i>

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,450
<i>old man!</i>

32
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:39,817
<i>Nice one.
 Now, finn.</i>

33
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,784
<i>Come on, there's no bad blood</i>

34
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:42,884
<i>here.
Come here.</i>

35
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:45,885
<i>Let's bury the hatchet.
See how I'm not killing you?</i>

36
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:48,320
<i>Dad, stop.</i>

37
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:50,488
<i> All right.
I don't want to embarrass my</i>

38
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:52,888
<i>little girl.
So, young lady, have you</i>

39
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,989
<i>thought about my offer?
 Ugh!</i>

40
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,856
<i>What offer,
marceline's dad?</i>

41
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,858
<i>I want marceline to take over</i>

42
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:03,659
<i>the nightosphere -- finally
join the family business.</i>

43
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:06,759
<i> Business?
Dad, what do you even do?</i>

44
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:08,829
<i> Oh! Ha!
Come on, come on, come on, come</i>

45
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:12,095
<i>on.
Check it out, sweetie.</i>

46
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,263
<i>See how chaotic it is out
there?</i>

47
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:17,565
<i>How everyone's confused and</i>

48
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:20,100
<i>frustrated?
The nightosphere is sustained</i>

49
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:25,835
<i>by chaos.
 Eh, I just don't see myself</i>

50
00:02:25,836 --> 00:02:28,969
<i>doing this biz.
 Okay, but I know you'll come</i>

51
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,268
<i>around eventually.
Or maybe you won't.</i>

52
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,436
<i>I don't know.
You're an independent woman.</i>

53
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:35,672
<i>Aaah!</i>

54
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:41,007
<i> Well, I'm gonna take a nappy.
Oh! I almost forgot.</i>

55
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:42,508
<i>Dad!</i>

56
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,741
<i> Whoops!</i>

57
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:48,042
<i>You should put this amulet on.
It'll Grant you wishes for,</i>

58
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,542
<i>like, ponies -- or whatever
kids like.</i>

59
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:54,412
<i> Dad, I'm 1,000 years old.
 Ha! Yes, you are, sweetie.</i>

60
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:57,379
<i>Daddy's little monster.</i>

61
00:02:57,382 --> 00:03:00,581
<i> Look, let's just play
something, okay?</i>

62
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:03,981
<i>Okay.

63
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,017

00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,325
<i>Ooh--
aaaaaaarrgh!</i>

71
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:34,060
<i>Jake, grab the amulet!
Oof!</i>

72
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:38,695
<i>Ow! My hippocampus!</i>

73
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:41,729
Well, that explains how

74
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,129
we got amnesia'ed.
But what about banana?

75
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:46,597
Hey, man, there's
another video.

76
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:53,100
<i>We got mad prison-overcrowding
down here, fellas.</i>

77
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:55,634
<i>So, I got to put you in the
cage with the stuff.</i>

78
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:57,935
<i>Sorry about that.
But, you know, not really.</i>

79
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:03,803
<i>Oh, my stomach!</i>

80
00:04:08,774 --> 00:04:11,306
- Yeeeee!
- That amulet's

81
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:16,408
controlling marceline!
We have to go back and help her!

82
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:21,510
We're gonna get back using that
one portal spell we know.

83
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:26,645
Hah!
Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum!

84
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:30,147
Whoa, dude.
She told us never to come back.

85
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:33,947
Oh, yeah.
Oh!

86
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,215
Jake, can you turn into a gross
demon?

87
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:40,584
Mm-hmm.
- Grosser!

88
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:43,585
- Raaaaaah!
- What's your

89
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:46,787
- disguise?
Paper-plate mask, yo!

90
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,055
- Nice!

91
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:50,955
Let's go! Hyah!

92
00:04:53,856 --> 00:05:00,758
Who's next? Who's next?
Uh...Me, my lord aberdeer.

93
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,561
What do you desire, cowering
speck -- pain, pleasure, or

94
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:10,861
weird punishment?
Uh...Pleasure?

95
00:05:10,864 --> 00:05:14,563
No! Weird punishment!

96
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:21,800
<i>And what do you desire --</i>

97
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:25,634
"p," "p," or "w.P."?
I...

98
00:05:25,637 --> 00:05:30,036
Pain?
Okay.

99
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:33,671
Aw.
Come on! Come on! Next!

100
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:36,571
I'm just gonna go.
You sure, dude?

101
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:42,008
Don't you want abs?
Yeah, give me abs.

102
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,240
I think we can charge

103
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,609
up there and rip the amulet off
her neck.

104
00:05:50,912 --> 00:05:55,145
Hey! What are you guys doing?!
You can't run up to the front of

105
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,380
the line!
These good people have been

106
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,714
waiting forever!
Shame on you both!

107
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:03,015
Everybody, shame them!

108
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,415
Boo, sir!
I boo what you're doing!

109
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:10,351
Step back -- back!
You will not cut the line again!

110
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:15,920
You stay back here and wait your
turn like the rest of us!

111
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:19,154
- Understand?!
- Yeah, okay! Okay!

112
00:06:19,156 --> 00:06:22,989
I'll be watching you.
Sorry, dude.

113
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,989
You got out of line.
Dang it!

114
00:06:33,162 --> 00:06:35,626
- Who are you?!
- Waah!

115
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,161
- Don't kill us, marceline!
- It's us --

116
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:38,461
- finn and Jake!
- Your friends,

117
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:41,563
remember?!
Eh.

118
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:44,396
Oh, grob!

119
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,464
Aaaaaah!

120
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,566
Run!

121
00:06:58,702 --> 00:07:04,771
Marceline.
What are you doing?

122
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:07,940
Just grabbing a midnight
snack.

123
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,274
It's marceline.
That's her out there!

124
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:12,474
I know.
Isn't it fantastic?

125
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:14,843
No!
We have to save her!

126
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:17,076
- Save her?
- From the amulet!

127
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:20,442
But this is what I've always
wanted -- my girl following in

128
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:23,312
<i>- her daddy's footsteps.
- But that's not what she</i>

129
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:25,612
wants!
That's balderdash, baby.

130
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:29,213
The wearer of the amulet is
filled with chaotic evil, which

131
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:33,614
is how I grew up, so...

132
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:41,486
Maybe we can get these
dudes to help us.

133
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:47,653
These
guys won't help you.

134
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:54,324
They're all complacent sheeple.

135
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:57,390
Wait. That's it!
We're gonna freestyle a

136
00:07:57,392 --> 00:08:00,692
political rap to get these guys
to rise out of their systemized

137
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:02,992
- demon apathy!
- Okay.

138
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:07,495
Yeah. Unh.

139
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:10,394
Political rap!
Yo, yo!

140
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:12,997
Demon apathy!
Yo, zappity!

141
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,297
Get ready!
Government!

142
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:18,633
Where you went!
Yo! Farmer's market!

143
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:22,768
Ride bikes! Get on it!
Geodesic domes!

144
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,168
Science!
You heard?

145
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,736
I never thought of it that

146
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:33,172
way before.
This system is broke, yo!

147
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:52,812
Marceline.

148
00:08:52,814 --> 00:09:00,381
Ugh. Sick.

149
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:03,082
- Jake! The tree house!
- Aaaah!

150
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,950
I'm too freaked out to move,
finn!

151
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:09,451
These demons are nibbling my
legs!

152
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:12,551
- Jake, take her!
- No, finn!

153
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:18,822
You'll be filled with chaotic
evil!

154
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:26,357
Aaaaah!

155
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:44,230
Marceline.
No one leaves the nightosphere!

156
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:51,833
Wh-o-o-o-oa!

157
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:55,536
Oh!
Marceline!

158
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:57,501
Uh, I wonder what happened to
him.

159
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,270
Kids these days.
Am I right?

160
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:04,806
Dude. Seriously.
Dad, you tricked me.

161
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,940
Dad, that sucks!
I know. I'm sorry.

162
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:14,241
But I thought you'd want to --
want to make your old man proud

163
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:16,608
and, you know, take over the
nightosphere.

164
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:21,111
<i>Yeah, I want you to be proud!
I want you to be proud of me!</i>

165
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:25,180
No, I didn't mean --
baby, of course I'm proud of

166
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,512
you.
Dad.

167
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:29,247
And your friends, they're all
right!

168
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:32,048
That political rap?
Pretty great!

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,316
Okay, okay.
I got to go now, dad.

170
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:40,384
Woof! What a nightmare.
Man, finn, my dad actually likes

171
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,685
you.

172
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,952
I don't want to hang out with

173
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:46,121
- you anymore.

174
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:48,387
Finn?
