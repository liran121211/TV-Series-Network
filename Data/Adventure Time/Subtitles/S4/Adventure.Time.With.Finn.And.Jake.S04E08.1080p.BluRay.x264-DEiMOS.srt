1
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:34,974
The tree of blight.

2
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,839
Every hundred years,
it spews evil spores

3
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,176
across the land.

4
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:44,242
Then let's burn its butt
down to the root-rubbings!

5
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,679
Finn, I can feel
a bunch of

6
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,950
eyeballs peeping
us from the woods.

7
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,122
Hugs!

8
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:55,128
What the...

9
00:00:55,197 --> 00:00:56,755
is this an extra butt?

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,199
Quick, Jake,
burn the tree.

11
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,862
Grr, hugs.

12
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,271
Gonna catch you up,
boy.

13
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:08,139
I'm gonna sugar
you to pieces.

14
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,541
Dude!

15
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,444
The tree's about to 'splode
its evil juice all over.

16
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:13,481
No!

17
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:17,574
Ugh!

18
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:21,452
Jake! Hurry!

19
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:23,047
Is he crushing you,
man?

20
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,593
No, he's just
hugging me gently.

21
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:26,821
Oh.

22
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:31,761
When you see
the wicker devil in tree afterlife,

23
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:34,325
tell him Jake says "Hello."

24
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:40,970
Aah! Aah-ha-ha!

25
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:44,872
Ugh.

26
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:46,380
Hey, buddy. You okay?

27
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:48,848
Didn't even tell
me its name.

28
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:49,747
What?

29
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,046
Oh, sweet.

30
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,421
Hot to the touch.

31
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:08,934
Hmm.

32
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,596
Dude, why are you so huggy?

33
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,663
I just feel affectionate,
I guess.

34
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:14,174
Hugging helps.

35
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:15,972
Mm.

36
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:18,137
You got a fever, man.

37
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:19,475
I feel hot.

38
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:22,073
Finn, you're hurting me.

39
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:23,880
I think you need a
good night's sleep.

40
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:37,621
You feeling
better today?

41
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,563
Yeah.

42
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:39,601
I feel like a
million clams.

43
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:40,794
Good.

44
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,737
Hey, you think we
have enough candy litter?

45
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:47,298
Litter for lunch! Mmm.

46
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,570
Huh?

47
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:50,669
Huh? Not again.

48
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:51,576
What's the matter,
Cinnamon Bun?

49
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,171
Please, Finn.

50
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:56,217
If you're gonna hug me again,
don't make it as hard as you

51
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:58,082
hugged me last night.

52
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:00,178
Uh, I didn't hug
you last night.

53
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:01,779
Yes, you did.

54
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:04,485
My love handles still hurt.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,018
You came into my room around
midnight and gave me a

56
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:10,997
squeeze...
a really strong one!

57
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:16,460
C. B. Says I hugged him.

58
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,933
Cinnamon Bun,
you've got some crazy notions.

59
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:20,906
I tell you.

60
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,713
Oh, Cinnamon Bun.

61
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,753
What a crazy story, buddy.

62
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:38,053
Yeah, buddy.

63
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:40,424
But you were pretty
huggy last night, buddy.

64
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,963
Wait.

65
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,827
You don't think I actually snuck
into Cinnamon Bun's room and

66
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:45,025
hugged him, do you?

67
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,536
I'm just saying,
you were really clingy.

68
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:49,628
But... no.

69
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:51,297
Why would I?

70
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:52,931
And don't tell me it's because
I have repressed emotional

71
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:54,566
feelings for Cinnamon Bun.

72
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:55,701
No.

73
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,405
I have a theory,
but I don't like it.

74
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:04,175
Your questionable behavior
started about an hour or so

75
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:06,813
after you got hugged by
that wolf-man, right?

76
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:09,187
So?

77
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,424
Well, I've been thinking
that maybe that wolf-man

78
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:16,987
wasn't what he seemed.

79
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,965
Maybe he was some
sort of "Hug Wolf."

80
00:04:19,034 --> 00:04:20,592
Yeah, here it is.

81
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:23,638
Hug-Wolves...
"A subset of wolf-men

82
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:26,799
which roam the countryside
with a fervid hug-lust.

83
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,811
Every night, hug-wolves must go
out and hug people to satisfy

84
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,040
their insatiable
craving for hugs.

85
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:37,449
To become a hug wolf, one must
be hugged by an alpha hug wolf

86
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,646
on the night
of a full moon!

87
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:40,710
Like last night!

88
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,222
Yes.

89
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,589
So you must be a
beta hug wolf...

90
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,287
a lower-level creature.

91
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:48,090
Well, how can
I get un-cursed?

92
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,859
Let me, um, read the
book a little more.

93
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,696
It says there's
no known cure.

94
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:56,871
I'm scared, Jake.

95
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:58,304
No hugs!

96
00:04:58,373 --> 00:04:59,772
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:04,571
I feel hot.

98
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,346
What's wrong,
Beemo?

99
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:17,358
I'm terrified of Finn.

100
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:18,586
Hmm.

101
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,096
Well, that plant's
not gonna protect you.

102
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:24,530
You can get this
under control, buddy.

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,966
Are you ready to
overcome this thing?!

104
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,400
I think so.

105
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,167
<i>I said, "Are you ready to
overcome this thing?!"</i>

106
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,832
Yeah. I heard you.

107
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,206
I said, "I think so."

108
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:36,539
I'm trying to
get you to shout.

109
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:38,011
Oh. Okay.

110
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,105
Is this good?!

111
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:41,376
Never mind.

112
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,044
Now, I want you to think
about hugging a cactus.

113
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,347
How would that feel?

114
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,978
Prickly and painful.

115
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:47,987
Good. Good.

116
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,250
You're doing great.

117
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:50,256
Cool.

118
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:51,849
So, can I hug
the cactus now?

119
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:53,792
No, you can't
hug anything.

120
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:55,227
But that poor cactus.

121
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:58,027
It...
it needs me!

122
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,332
Ah, no.

123
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,430
The hug-lust has already
taken over your brain.

124
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:07,168
I want to hug you, Jake.

125
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:20,018
Finn?

126
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,715
Say something
to reassure me.

127
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,087
I'll hug your mom.

128
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,589
Jake, we need
the silver baseball.

129
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,899
Hugs. Hugs. Hugs.

130
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,994
Hugs for buddies!

131
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:41,173
Oh, glob,
oh my glob, Jake.

132
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:42,437
Mama!

133
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,778
Bring it in, guys.

134
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,212
Scream-o!

135
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,112
Beemo!

136
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:49,275
Strobe-light mode!

137
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,787
Not cool.

138
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:53,786
Back, beast.

139
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:09,633
Surely this frosted drink will
soothe my fevered tempers.

140
00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:14,371
Hello?

141
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:16,308
Good heavens.
A lycanthrope!

142
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:17,538
Aah!

143
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:18,909
Hug you up, bro.

144
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,419
Dracula?

145
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,554
Aah! Eee!

146
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,097
Hugs!

147
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,602
Get away from my daughter,
you hairy teenager!

148
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:44,400
Eee!

149
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,644
She'll never marry!

150
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,444
<i>Finn? Finn?</i>

151
00:07:58,954 --> 00:08:00,046
There he is.

152
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,622
Huh?

153
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,458
<i>Huh? What...
what happened?</i>

154
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,624
Jake, what happened
to me last night?

155
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,533
<i>You hugged everyone.</i>

156
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:15,592
No!

157
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,830
There he is!

158
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:21,371
We're mad, but we're
not gonna go down there.

159
00:08:21,443 --> 00:08:24,435
People of the Candy Kingdom,
all I've ever wanted was to

160
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:26,037
keep you all safe.

161
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:28,241
And because I can't undo
the hugs I've caused,

162
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:32,309
my sole wish is to be locked up
forever in the Candy dungeon.

163
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:37,180
Why is Finn in a cage,
mama?

164
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,783
Isn't hugs nice?

165
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,088
Oh, baby.

166
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:41,720
Candy people!

167
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:44,561
Let's make sure that alpha hug
wolf pays for what he's done.

168
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:45,565
Yeah!

169
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:47,829
Yeah!
I agree with the last guy.

170
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:50,098
Cinnamon Bun,
you watch over Finn.

171
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:51,730
Uh...

172
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:53,240
Let's go, boys.

173
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,401
Uhh... but... but... but...

174
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:57,570
No more hugs!

175
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:59,113
No more hugs!

176
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:00,443
No more hugs!

177
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:01,641
Without consent.

178
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,176
Huh?

179
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:09,917
Hugs!!

180
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,526
Finn?

181
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:16,589
Uh...

182
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:22,433
Cinnamon Bun,
let me out.

183
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:24,472
I...
I'm not supposed to.

184
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,439
Don't you want a hug?

185
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:28,066
I can't, man.

186
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:31,374
Not even a little one?

187
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,106
You want a hug?

188
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:38,780
Yes! Hug me!

189
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:40,116
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

190
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,849
Which way does it turn?

191
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:45,455
Ow!
Ow, my sides.

192
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:48,018
Say "No" to hugs!

193
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:52,999
I smell someone being
hugged right now!

194
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:54,968
Uh, I have a wife.

195
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:56,765
That hug be your last,
demon.

196
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:05,402
Still love you.

197
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,381
Raah! Come here, baby.

198
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,008
No huggies!

199
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:11,052
Raah.

200
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:13,588
Eh. Finn?

201
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,986
I've failed you.

202
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,395
I'm gonna hug you up.

203
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:24,159
You call that a hug?

204
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,232
This is the biggest hug
that's ever existed.

205
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:34,872
Yeah.

206
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:46,052
Huh?

207
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:50,822
You...
you stopped hugging me.

208
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:53,554
Yeah. You stopped, too.

209
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:56,791
I just didn't feel like
I needed any more hugs.

210
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,230
Me neither.

211
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,200
The curse is broken!

212
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,998
Can I get a hug?

213
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:04,766
Jake!

214
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,534
Mm.

215
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:07,540
Aah!
