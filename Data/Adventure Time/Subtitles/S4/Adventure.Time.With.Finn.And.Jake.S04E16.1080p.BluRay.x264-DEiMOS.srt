1
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:37,859
Well, looks like
your new house is done.

2
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:41,433
Jake, you want to check out
the new house?

3
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:43,594
Nah, don't let me
interrupt you.

4
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,569
You two have fun.

5
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:46,196
I wanna see inside.

6
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:50,431
I love it!

7
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:52,633
Great!

8
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:54,903
Huh. This doesn't hurt
as bad as it used to.

9
00:00:56,643 --> 00:00:57,736
Aaaaaaaaaah!

10
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,210
Oh, gob! Oh, gob! Oh, gob!

11
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:03,873
Finn!

12
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:05,279
I'm okay!

13
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:06,337
Hmm.

14
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:11,884
Oh!
Do the thing that I like.

15
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:22,889
<i>Now do the thing that I like.</i>

16
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,819
Classic.

17
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:32,384
All right, Finn,
that's enough.

18
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,724
Thank you for building
my new home, Finn.

19
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,060
I'm so happy.

20
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:41,362
You want a hug?

21
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,365
Yes.

22
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:45,060
Whoa. Hold on, mama.

23
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:50,896
Okay, bro, tinfoil's on.

24
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,962
You can hug now.

25
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,902
Bye.

26
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:05,035
Bye, Finn.

27
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:08,402
Bye.

28
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,575
Looks like your date
went pretty good, buddy.

29
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:16,412
Ah, I don't know.

30
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:18,577
Was the hug okay?
Give me some tips, mang.

31
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:21,984
Bro, you gotta let things
take their natural path.

32
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:24,988
Look. Look, let me explain some
junk about dating.

33
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,354
Right now you're at tier 1,
which is hugging.

34
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:30,084
But pretty soon,
you'll be at tier 2,

35
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:31,920
which is smooching.

36
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:34,619
Then down the road,
you'll make it to tier 5,

37
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,820
where she'll let you
discover all 15 feet

38
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:39,089
of her long,
beautiful stomach.

39
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:41,494
And after a while,
you'll make it to tier 8,

40
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,793
where you touch her horn
for the very first time.

41
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,195
Very special.

42
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:47,733
What about tier 15?

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,359
You stay away
from that!

44
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:52,698
Do not do tier 15!

45
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:54,600
Dude, I got no idea
what you're talking about.

46
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,159
Don't worry about it,
dude.

47
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,364
Just let things naturally move
to tier 2.

48
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,430
Oh, and, um...
you need a shower, dude.

49
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:02,768
What?!

50
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:05,775
Oh, gross!

51
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:07,503
Do you think Flame Princess
could smell me?

52
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:10,271
- Probably.
- Crup.

53
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:11,835
'Sup, guys?

54
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:13,106
Princess Bubblegum?!

55
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:14,646
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

56
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:15,976
Collecting taxes.

57
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:18,310
You guys weren't home,
so I let myself in.

58
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:21,043
- Oh.
- I'm gonna take a shower.

59
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:22,777
Princess, do not inhale!

60
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,512
- What? Why?
- Just don't!

61
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,214
What's that all
about?

62
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:29,618
Ah, he's just smelly
from a day of running around

63
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:31,019
with his lady friend.

64
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:34,023
Ooh! A lady friend.
Do tell.

65
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,115
<i>Uh, I shouldn't say.
It's his business.</i>

66
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:39,387
<i>Oh, come on.
You can tell me.</i>

67
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,450
That's his personal biz.

68
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,289
You gotta respect
a man's p-biz.

69
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:46,194
Okay, you're right.
I'll respect it.

70
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:48,559
Flame Princess! He was hanging out
with Flame Princess.

71
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,564
What?!

72
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,122
And I don't mean to be
telling stories out of school,

73
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,532
but pretty soon, they're gonna
be taking it to tier 2.

74
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:58,796
No.
This isn't possible.

75
00:03:58,869 --> 00:04:00,359
Oh, it's possible.

76
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:03,303
I just never thought...
Flame Princess.

77
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:06,169
I --
I have to go.

78
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,866
Morrow!

79
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:12,636
Hmm. Weird.

80
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,040
Guess who's late for their
video chat?

81
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,304
President Porpoise!

82
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:23,204
No. No.

83
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:28,978
Oh, gob.

84
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,383
I thought I'd be
ready for this.

85
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:35,710
Yowwwwwwwwn!

86
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:37,584
Jake, I'm going to see
Flame Princess.

87
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:38,486
Be back later.

88
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:40,853
Finn!

89
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:42,322
Aaaah!

90
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:44,723
Okay, Princess, you need
to stop breaking in here.

91
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,124
I have something
important to tell you

92
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:48,922
about relationships.

93
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:50,893
Uh, that's okay,
Princess.

94
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:52,896
I just hope
you'll understand.

95
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:56,221
Relationships are like layers
of sedimentary rock.

96
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,289
Jake, Flame Princess is
waiting for me.

97
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,662
I'm gonna bounce out.

98
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,667
Okay. Tier 2, baby.

99
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,929
Word.

100
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,100
If too much frustration builds,

101
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,194
the magma will erupt,
causing a catastrophic

102
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,829
superstratum of
igneous rock to form.

103
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:15,003
What? Where am I?

104
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:17,009
Jake, you're president now.

105
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:18,667
Oh, my gosh!

106
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:22,706
Jake!

107
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,573
Wake up!

108
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:28,114
- Jake, where's Finn?
- He stepped out.

109
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:31,774
Will you tell him why he can't
see Flame Princess anymore?

110
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,680
Oh.
Ohhh!

111
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,546
I see what's going on here.

112
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:38,587
Great. I cannot stress
how important it is

113
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:41,086
<i>that they not see each other.</i>

114
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:43,849
Oh, man.

115
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:47,084
PB is totally jealous of
Flame Princess!

116
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:51,257
Jump. Punch. Kick. Kick.

117
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:53,294
- 'Sup, man?
- Yo, dude.

118
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:54,418
So, what did PB want?

119
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:56,927
She doesn't want you to
see Flame Princess anymore.

120
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:58,656
She's crazy jealous.

121
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:03,189
So, you at tier 2 yet?

122
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:05,426
I got about five hugs.
Does that count?

123
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,728
Nope!

124
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,234
Well, still at tier 1.

125
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:12,201
I know exactly what'll
get you to tier 2 --

126
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:14,261
a sappy poem.

127
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:17,969
Say something about her
spectrum.

128
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:19,098
Ew!

129
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:20,266
Let's see...

130
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,466
she's bright.

131
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,906
She's beautiful.

132
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:25,170
She makes me feel...
confused.

133
00:06:25,243 --> 00:06:28,267
Like something's
filling up my chest.

134
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:30,040
Like I can't breathe.

135
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:32,705
Is it because she's so
dangerous?

136
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,407
Glob, Jake,
I-I can't stand it!

137
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:45,642
Inspiratio.

138
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,253
- Finn!
- Aaaah!

139
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:54,221
Whatcha doin'?

140
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,054
Oh. Uh, hi, Princess.

141
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,183
I'm, uh, writing
something for Jake.

142
00:06:58,258 --> 00:06:59,248
Oh.

143
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:02,386
Well, speaking of Jake, did he
explain everything to you?

144
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:03,724
Yeah.

145
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:07,127
- And you understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

146
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:10,463
Finn, sometimes
you want someone

147
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:14,729
and you want to kiss them
and be with them,

148
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,964
but you can't because
responsibility demands sacrifice.

149
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,096
What are you trying
to say?!

150
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:24,003
I'm trying to say
that you're a hero, Finn.

151
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:25,562
<i>You're my hero.</i>

152
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,039
So, I'm glad you understand

153
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:29,269
why you can't be with
Flame Princess.

154
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:33,137
Bubblegum, I can't do this
anymore!

155
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,007
- What?
- Now you like me?!

156
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:36,909
Finn, what are you
talking about?

157
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:38,469
<i>What am I talking about?!</i>

158
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:40,877
PB, I was --

159
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:45,912
I was in love
with you, okay?!

160
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,747
And you didn't love me back.

161
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:49,580
Now I'm ready to move on,
and it's like...

162
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:52,621
...you're gonna build me up
all over again.

163
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,279
Well, I'm done!

164
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:56,345
I'm done.

165
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:04,984
Oh, no.

166
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,688
♪ Bacon pancakes,
making bacon pancakes ♪

167
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:11,753
♪ Take some bacon,
and I'll put it in a pancake ♪

168
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:14,094
♪ Bacon pancakes, that's what
it's gonna make ♪

169
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,428
♪ Bacon panca-a-a-a-ke ♪

170
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,764
Finn?!
Jake, where's Finn?

171
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,994
Is he with Flame Princess?

172
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,299
Back off, Bubblegum.
That's his man's biz.

173
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,271
Is he with her
or not?!

174
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,329
You heartless monster.

175
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:32,373
Do you have any idea

176
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,431
how much
he's cried over you?!

177
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:36,601
Finn deserves to be happy!

178
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:39,269
Even if his bloopin' face
gets burned off!

179
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:42,870
You should be ashamed!

180
00:08:42,945 --> 00:08:45,277
- You're sick!
- What are you --

181
00:08:45,347 --> 00:08:48,110
This isn't about some
petty love triangle!

182
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:51,878
Flame Princess is
physically unstable!

183
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,783
Her elemental matrix can't
handle extreme romance.

184
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,876
Glob, if Finn tries
to kiss her,

185
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:59,614
she'll burn so hot,

186
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:02,553
she'll melt right through the
planet's crust,

187
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:04,420
down through the molten
core.

188
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,855
Then she'll be thrown back
and forth by gravity

189
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:09,894
until she burns out the world
from the inside!

190
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,450
Why do you think I had her father
keep her locked up?!

191
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:18,295
Will you take me
to them?

192
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:24,227
Faster!

193
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:26,234
Your wavelengths are my weakness.

194
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:28,963
Your emissions are what
I've been missing.

195
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:36,502
No.

196
00:09:38,873 --> 00:09:40,808
Aaah!

197
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,202
Flame Princess?!

198
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,201
Flame Princess!

199
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,541
Finn!

200
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:52,012
Finn, there's no time!
You have to --

201
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,809
Are you all right?

202
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:55,872
Finn!

203
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,743
Flame Princess!

204
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:07,880
It's hot!

205
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:10,354
Wait. Wait!
Don't move.

206
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:11,413
This is good.

207
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,391
If you stay
on the hole for 24.8 seconds,

208
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,984
the reaction will be
deprived of oxygen.

209
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,220
She'll go out.

210
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:20,853
What about Finn?

211
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,227
Hey.
What's wrong?

212
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:25,161
Please -- say something.

213
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,333
Please, I need you...

214
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,333
to be okay.

215
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:37,666
Huh?

216
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:47,508
Are you okay?

217
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:49,441
I'm okay. I'm okay.

218
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:54,910
She's stabilized.

219
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:56,707
We're safe...

220
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,771
for now.

221
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:05,008
Oh, Finn.

222
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:09,684
What?

223
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,652
Jealous?

224
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,087
Shut up.
