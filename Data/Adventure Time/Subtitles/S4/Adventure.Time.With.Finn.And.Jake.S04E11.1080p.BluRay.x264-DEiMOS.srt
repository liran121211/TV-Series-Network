1
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:39,218
Man, let's go home.

2
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:40,309
Nuts to that.

3
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:41,684
I want to find
a mystery cave.

4
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:45,988
But, Finn, I'm getting all
cranky around my joke-hole.

5
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,891
Oof!

6
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:47,792
Ow!

7
00:00:47,862 --> 00:00:48,693
Ooh la-la!

8
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:49,593
What's that?

9
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:50,596
Mystery cave!

10
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:51,654
Come on, Jake!

11
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:56,501
Oh, my glory.

12
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:05,103
Dude, no!

13
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:06,670
Don't touch that thing.

14
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:09,479
It's probably got some kind
of sacred significance.

15
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:12,111
Yeah, I want it for
my sacred bathroom.

16
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:15,145
Finn?

17
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:19,820
Oh, my jah!

18
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:21,693
Finn's become one
with the lamb!

19
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:24,362
Huh?

20
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:31,065
Jake!
You see this crazy jazz?

21
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:32,801
We'll get through this,
my bro.

22
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:36,505
I swear I'm gonna get
you out of that lamb.

23
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:41,784
Jake!

24
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,376
Come on.
Quit messing with me.

25
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:45,148
Whoa!

26
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:46,382
Ow. Ow.

27
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:47,616
Ow.

28
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:56,793
Wish I knew how
to free you, bro.

29
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,465
Me too, bro.

30
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,472
Pbbbbbt!

31
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,837
Thbbt!

32
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:05,375
Thbbbt!

33
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:06,671
Pbbbbbt!

34
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:08,507
Beemo,
stop fake-farting!

35
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:11,173
But Finn always
loved Beemo farting.

36
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:12,546
Thbbt!

37
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:13,914
Thbbt!

38
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,116
Hmm.

39
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:17,586
That's it!

40
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,453
We'll do all Finn's favorite
stuff till he comes out!

41
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:22,653
Beemo,
play Finn's favorite song!

42
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,423
Okay!

43
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:25,986
<i>♪ three baby spiders... ♪</i>

44
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,862
What?! No!

45
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,592
No! Not this song!

46
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:34,764

47
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,831
Are you hearing this, buddy?

48
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,207
Guys, I haven't liked
this song since I was 2!

49
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:40,438
Aggggh!

50
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:43,811
Cut it out!

51
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:50,583
Leaf princess!

52
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:52,989
Come to me,
my arboreal beauty!

53
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:53,991
Gotcha!

54
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:57,627
It's just a dumb, old leaf,
you dumb, old Ice King.

55
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:59,289
I know,
but it's mine.

56
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:00,993
Wait! What?

57
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,329
Ice King,
you can hear me?

58
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:03,528
Yes.

59
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:05,764
Why? Are you making fun of me
or something?

60
00:03:05,838 --> 00:03:09,434
No, it's just no one else
can see me or hear me talk.

61
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:11,671
Ohh. Yeah.

62
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:14,340
You're trapped in
the spirit realm.

63
00:03:14,414 --> 00:03:19,409
I can see all things spirit
with my "Wizard eyes"!

64
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:22,786
<i>Man, never thought I'd be happy
to talk to you, Ice King.</i>

65
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:24,119
Can you help
me get free?

66
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,250
Oh, yeah. I know all
the ins and outs.

67
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:29,228
And I'd do anything
for a friend like you.

68
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,766
Quiet, Gunther. Can't you see
I'm hanging with Finn?

69
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,607
I know I say that a lot,
but this time, it's true.

70
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:44,034
Anyways, where do all
these spirits come from?

71
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,842
Oh, there are portals
all over the universe.

72
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:48,542
I have one in my basement.

73
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:52,178
Every once in a while,
a real cutie pie drifts through.

74
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:55,621
Oh!
Gosh, there she is.

75
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,487
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

76
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,652
Sick.

77
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:01,890
What?
I swear I never touch 'em.

78
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:02,987
I can't!

79
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:04,363
Can't touch this!

80
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:05,765
Can't touch this!

81
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,132
<i>Can't touch this, either!</i>

82
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,768
Yep, I can't
kill any of them.

83
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:16,207
I hate them.

84
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:17,940
Okay, all right.

85
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:19,208
Enough messing around.

86
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:21,147
Let's get you free
from the spirit plane.

87
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:22,377
Cool.

88
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:29,348
So, the only way to get out
of the spirit world is to

89
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:33,624
stick all these lousy things
in the spirit hole down there,

90
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:35,688
then plug up the
hole with that.

91
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:37,927
And doing that will
send me back to normal?

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,401
Mm-hmm! Trust me!

93
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,234
We are tur-bros!

94
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:43,671
Turbo bros.

95
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:45,674
Tur...bros.

96
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:49,008
Turbo...bros.

97
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:52,975
So be it.

98
00:05:03,994 --> 00:05:05,121
All right, Finn.

99
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:07,721
This ought to free you
from your body prison.

100
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:10,097
Couple of rounds of Kompy's
Kastle will jog your

101
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,601
psychic Schnapps.

102
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:12,728
That's what I think.

103
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:14,602
Co-op mode,
like we always do.

104
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:15,799
Oh, yeah!

105
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,773
Come on, Finn.
Drop the drawbridge.

106
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:20,971
Kompy's bloodlust
meter's going down.

107
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:23,037
Let me help you there.

108
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,276
Wazza!

109
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,818
You love Kompy.

110
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:36,225
I...did it!

111
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,923
Whew! I did it.

112
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:40,396
I'm ready, Ice King.

113
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,832
Make me normal now.

114
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:43,893
Ohh, that's not
all of them.

115
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,097
There's this other
guy that watches me.

116
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:48,607
He's...super-creepy.

117
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:52,201
Do you see it?

118
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:53,837
<i>Oh, it sees you.</i>

119
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:55,814
Catch it and put it
in the spirit hole!

120
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:57,975
In the spirit hole,
where it can't see me anymore --

121
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,211
so you can be free!

122
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:02,751
Huh?

123
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:06,056
Get it! Get it!

124
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:08,152
Ugh! Aah!

125
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:09,491
Get it in the hole!

126
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:11,225
Ew! Ew! Ew!

127
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:12,391
Ew!

128
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:15,767
Yes!

129
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:17,201
It's gone!

130
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,296
So...now I can go
back to normal?

131
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:21,068
Uh...wait, though.

132
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,370
What?

133
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,308
There's this last
guy you got to get.

134
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:26,210
He's pretty much the worst.

135
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,408
He usually leaves
these gross heads around,

136
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:29,677
but I'm not seeing
them anywhe--

137
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,185
Aah! Ew!
There it is! There it is!

138
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:33,221
Wan wan!

139
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:34,186
Wan wan wan!

140
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,349
Noooooo!

141
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:37,517
No!
Don't come near me!

142
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:39,117
What is that?

143
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:41,025
It's from the dead one.

144
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:43,223
He leaves these
heads around everywhere.

145
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:45,789
I can't even touch them,
but it still creeps me out.

146
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:46,697
Wan wan!

147
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:47,894
Please get rid of him!

148
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:48,800
What do I do?

149
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:49,701
Follow the heads?

150
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:50,739
Yes, the heads!

151
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:52,104
Oh, snow, please!

152
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,674
All right, man. I'll get it.

153
00:06:58,847 --> 00:06:59,974
Wan wan.

154
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:01,209
Where's your daddy, huh?

155
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:02,945
Is he hiding in there?

156
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:04,111
Wan wan.

157
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,220
Ugh!

158
00:07:12,294 --> 00:07:13,922
Better get back in
the spirit hole, dead one.

159
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:15,488
Blagh.

160
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:16,897
Okay.

161
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:18,932
Hyah!

162
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:20,733
Ugh!

Hyup! Oof!

166
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:28,336
Oh, bolts!

167
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:30,744
Whoo! Yeah, get him!

168
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:33,943

00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,787
Weird.

173
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:41,689
That's weird,
but whatevs, though.

174
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:48,155
Whatevs.

00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:17,792
Dude, come on! What?

187
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:19,160
Ha ha, Finn!

188
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,530
You fell right into for my
brilliant plan that I formed

189
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,365
out of the thin air
like a true magi!

190
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:28,272
Not only did I get you to remove
those horrible creatures from my

191
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:33,279
<i>castle, but now you're trapped,
and only I can see you.</i>

192
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,781
So, if you want friends,
this is it, pal.

193
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,579
I'm gonna
re-open the hole.

194
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,643
No, wait!
My plan fell apart!

195
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,088
<i>My new plan is that you don't
open the hole and I destroy the</i>

196
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,591
porcelain lamb,
which will bring you

197
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,855
back to the material plane.

198
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,365
Jake.

199
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,167
Ugh! Blah!

200
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,296
Give me that lamb!

201
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,362
No!

202
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,901
Finn's trapped in here!

203
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,841
That's why I
have to smash it!

204
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,037
You donk!

205
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,205
<i>I will smash you!</i>

206
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,269
Blaaaaaaaah!

207
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,751
Escape!

208
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,581
Aah! My winter body!

209
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,814
I was gonna start up on the
elliptical again,

210
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,482
but I got depressed, okay?

211
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,820
Don't look at me!

212
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:20,258
Ow!

213
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:22,557
Ooooh!

214
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:28,594
Aaah! They're touching
me for real!

215
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,864
Ew!

216
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,235
<i>Great. Now we're both
stuck in here.</i>

217
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,238
Aaah!

218
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,399
Finn,
give me your clothes!

219
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:34,305
Stop!

220
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,775
I need a buffer!

221
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:36,811
Gah!

222
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:38,141
Oh, geez! Come on!

223
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:44,386
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

224
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:46,854
They were just touching
me on the body.

225
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:48,220
I'm sorry.

226
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,383
Whoa.
Do that again.

227
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,687
I'm sorry.

228
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,988
I'm sorry.

229
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,052
They were touching my body.

230
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,688
I'm sorry.

231
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,665
Your hand is
affecting the TV!

232
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:00,669
We must have some kind of subtle
effect on the material plane.

233
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,500
Cool.

234
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:04,130
What do you think,
Finn?

235
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:08,702
Can we pull back the veil of
static and reach into the source

236
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,303
of all being?

237
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,578
Behind this curtain of patterns,
this random pattern generator.

238
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,710
So clever.

239
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:21,417
<i>Right here, in every home,
watching us from a one-sided mirror.</i>

240
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:24,550
Whoops!

241
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:26,425
Just wizard-talking to myself.

242
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:28,488
It's okay, but let's use
our subtle influence to

243
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:29,795
break the lamb.

244
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:30,766
Yeah, a'ight.

245
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:31,928
You mean like this?

246
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:34,369
Whoooosh.

247
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:36,737
Yeah, man! Whoo!

248
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,875
It's working, man!

249
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:42,277
Combine the swirls!

250
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:43,279
Okay.

251
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:45,077
Wazza!

252
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,173
Whoa!

253
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,616
Finn, is that you?

254
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:51,413
Yes!

255
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:53,584
Finn! Finn! Finn!

256
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:58,886
Whoa!

257
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:01,991
That was beautiful.

258
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:07,536
Let's go flush this in
the sacred bathroom.
