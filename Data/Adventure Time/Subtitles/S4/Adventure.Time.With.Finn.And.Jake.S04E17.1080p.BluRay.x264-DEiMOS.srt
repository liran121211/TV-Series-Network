1
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:43,732
Ha ha ha.
Take that, Master Chen.

2
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:45,242
Jake?

3
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:46,744
What?

4
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:49,008
Jake, did you hide my sock?

5
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:50,105
No, man.

6
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:52,913
I told you -- I don't do that
kind of stuff anymore.

7
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:54,351
So, what?

8
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:56,115
It just magically disappeared?

9
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:59,181
I don't know.

10
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:00,921
Maybe.

11
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,828
Is that just a cute way
of saying you took it?

12
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,887
No!

13
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,556
Why don't you just help me
find my sock?

14
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:08,158
Oh, Finn lost his sock!

15
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,725
Everybody stop
what you're doing

16
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,296
and help Finn
find his precious sock!

17
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,869
<i>It looked like a tough case to crack,</i>

18
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:20,211
<i>but... I hate to see
good friends fight.</i>

19
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:22,876
<i>So I decide to take the case.</i>

20
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:28,955
Hmm.

21
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,858
Ronnie.

22
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,787
<i>It looked like I had
a guilty mouse.</i>

23
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:54,709
Hello, Ronnie.

24
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:56,879
What do you want, Beemo?

25
00:01:58,255 --> 00:01:59,986
Where is Finn's sock?

26
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:02,617
I don't know what you're
talking about, Beemo.

27
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:04,492
I didn't do nothing.
Leave me alone!

28
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:09,533
<i>I knew that lipstick anywhere.</i>

29
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:10,728
How is Lorraine?

30
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:12,532
You stay away from her!

31
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:14,597
She's with me now.
Do you hear?

32
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:16,436
Calm down, big guy.

33
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:19,444
Me and Lorraine are...
dinosaur bones.

34
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:22,209
<i>Good.
'Cause I would be so jealous.</i>

35
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,584
Just tell me where the sock is,
and I will let you go.

36
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:28,120
I don't know, man.

37
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:30,624
What if I put some knuckle
in your eyeballs?

38
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,180
Would that help you think?

39
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:33,921
Okay! Okay!

40
00:02:33,994 --> 00:02:35,292
Um...

41
00:02:35,362 --> 00:02:38,355
it looks like a grape-juice
stain on his sock.

42
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:40,730
Check the pantry.

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,203
<i>Of course,
I didn't trust Ronnie.</i>

44
00:02:44,272 --> 00:02:46,468
<i>But I had no other leads.</i>

45
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,476
<i>Maybe the grape juice had
some secrets to tell me.</i>

46
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:53,743
<i>Or maybe Ronnie was just
pulling my hair.</i>

47
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:58,447
Ugh.

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,251
<i>Just as I thought --
not even opened.</i>

49
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:03,225
<i>I fell right into his trap.</i>

50
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,920
Let me out, you!

51
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,624
I will get you!

52
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:10,463
Piece of you, Ronnie!

53
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:11,466
Oof!

54
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:15,165
Oh. Officer Davis.
Thank goodness. I--

55
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:17,071
Beemo, what are you doing here?

56
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:19,473
Looking for Finn's sock --
same as you.

57
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,705
We got this under control.

58
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:23,714
Stay out of police business,

59
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:27,582
or you will be the one
behind bars.

60
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:30,120
<i>I didn't listen to that cop.</i>

61
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:32,350
<i>I needed to find Ronnie.</i>

62
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:37,090
<i>And I knew just the lady
who could lead me to him.</i>

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,560
<i>She looked
as beautiful as ever.</i>

64
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:46,865
Where is the sock,
Lorraine?

65
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:49,408
What makes you think I know?

66
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:51,945
I saw your lipstick
on his fur,

67
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,004
so don't act so cute.

68
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:57,540
It sounds like somebody's
jealous, no?

69
00:03:57,617 --> 00:04:00,143
Don't count on it, Lorraine.

70
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,554
Now, tell me
where Ronnie is.

71
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:05,252
Ha!
You think it was Ronnie?

72
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:08,090
<i>Maybe if he was man enough
to steal a sock,</i>

73
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:11,530
I wouldn't have
spent my nights with Bebe.

74
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,091
Bebe?!

75
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:17,071
<i>So you are saying Bebe
is man enough?</i>

76
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,163
What? No.

77
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,607
You are putting words
in my mouth.

78
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:23,646
Bebe doesn't know anything
about Finn's sock.

79
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:27,046
<i>Finn's sock?</i>

80
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:30,280
How do you know
it was Finn's sock?

81
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:33,846
I never said whose sock was
stolen, Lorraine.

82
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:35,517
I, um, um...

83
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:37,720
I heard it on the TV news.

84
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:39,787
No dice, sweet beak.

85
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:43,528
Officer Davis has this case
under tight wraps.

86
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,694
Uh, uh... fine!

87
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,205
Bebe stole the sock!
Okay?

88
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:49,331
Oh, Beemo.

89
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:51,274
Can't you just
forget about it?

90
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:52,367
Sorry, lady.

91
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:54,936
Forgetting ain't
in my job description.

92
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:59,650
Does this mean you still
remember... us?

93
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,754
Ha ha. Same old Lorraine.

94
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:12,527
Well, don't tell Ronnie
about me and Bebe.

95
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:15,626
You know how he gets
when he's jealous.

96
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:24,843
<i>Bebe owned Bebe's,
a dance club downtown.</i>

97
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:26,904
<i>He yells at ladies.</i>

98
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:30,446
<i>Wake up, brainiac.</i>

99
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:32,509
Beemo? Aah! Aah!

100
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:34,021
Arrgh!

101
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:36,025
Where is the sock, Bebe?

102
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:38,459
Uh...

103
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,757
I don't know
nothin' 'bout socks!

104
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:42,423
Don't play dumb, Bebe.

105
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:44,022
Don't play dumb with me.

106
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:48,967
I talked to Lorraine, Bebe.

107
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:50,564
She sold you out, dum-dum.

108
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,132
No!
She -- she wouldn't do that!

109
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,201
It wasn't me! I swear!

110
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:57,076
<i>It was Ronnie!</i>

111
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:59,309
Ronnie? But why?

112
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:01,682
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

113
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:04,520
Oh, Lorraine.

114
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,485
I'm gonna go wash this
schmutz off my grabbers.

115
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:14,498
When I get back, you better
start talking sense.

116
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,439
<i>It wasn't adding up.</i>

117
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,941
<i>Why would Ronnie
swipe the sock?</i>

118
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,637
<i>And why would Lorraine
finger Bebe?</i>

119
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:31,242
<i>Sure, he's a dirtbag born out
of a mother, but who's not?</i>

120
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:32,842
I don't really get it.

121
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,289
<i>Maybe it was time
to cut my losses.</i>

122
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:39,849
Come on, Bebe.
Let's get you cleaned up.

123
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:42,293
Bebe?

124
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:44,490
Bebe!

125
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:46,624
Dead!

126
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,398
This doesn't look good.
I better hightail it!

127
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:52,065
Huh?! The cops!

128
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,404
It was a setup!

129
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:56,911
Oh. Oh, no.

130
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:58,741
Bang, bang!
Pyoo! Pyoo! Pyoo!

131
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:03,879
Whoa!

132
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:05,580
Ugh!

133
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:06,747
Ugh! Ugh!

134
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:08,051
Ohh...

135
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:10,958
ugh...

136
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:13,189
Hey, has anyone seen Beemo?

137
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:14,924
Beemo!

138
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:16,966
Where's Beemo?

139
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:19,196
Hello?

140
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:23,638
<i>With the lipstick, she looked
as beautiful as ever.</i>

141
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:29,044
I'm worried about Beemo.

142
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:37,087
This is real.

143
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:38,953
Beemo!

144
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:41,016
Who's Beemo?

145
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:47,359
Hello?

146
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,732
Hello? Hello?

147
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,465
Hello? Hello?
Hello?

148
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,133
Hey, Beemo.
Wake up, buddy.

149
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,836
Are you all right?

150
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:02,912
I feel like I got hit
with a Dracula by King Kong.

151
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,383
Whoa. Sorry, man.

152
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,512
You want some pie
or something?

153
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,715
Sorry. I gotta run.
The cops are after me.

154
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,656
Have you seen any down here?

155
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,127
Nah. No one's been
down here all day,

156
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:16,960
except me, you,
and Ronnie.

157
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:19,227
What?! What was Ronnie
doing down here?

158
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,233
I don't know.

159
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,793
But now my sensors indicate

160
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,429
that some treasure
is missing.

161
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:26,168
About a sock's worth.

162
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,573
That's it!

163
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:29,374
That's why Ronnie
took the sock --

164
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:31,777
to carry stolen treasure in
with!

165
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,749
He had to whack Bebe to keep him
from squealing.

166
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:36,547
Then, he pinned the rap
on me.

167
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,349
Bebe's dead?

168
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:41,550
Listen, NEPTR, you better
lay low for a while.

169
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,491
I'm gonna go find Ronnie.

170
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,552
I've got a score to settle.

171
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:46,858
Hey, Beemo.

172
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,057
We should hang out more.

173
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:50,795
We're both robots.

174
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:54,862
<i>No, NEPTR.
I am not like you.</i>

175
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:00,842
- Ronnie?
- Evening, Beemo.

176
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:05,641
Don't worry, buddy.
You're off the hook.

177
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,709
We know it was Ronnie
who killed Bebe

178
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:10,052
<i>and snatched the treasure.</i>

179
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:13,684
We found this confession on him
after the shootout.

180
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,285
Hmm.
What about the sock?

181
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:19,890
Forget the sock, Beemo.
The case is closed.

182
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:22,799
Let it go, buddy.
It's over.

183
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:24,098
<i>Maybe he was right,</i>

184
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:27,471
<i>but I just couldn't shake
the feeling that, somehow,</i>

185
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:32,344
<i>this case had slipped
right through my fingers.</i>

186
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:33,642
Lipstick?

187
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,312
Ohh! Ohh!

188
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:47,990
Lorraine!

189
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:49,998
Beemo?

190
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:52,432
Get back here with that
treasure, Lorraine!

191
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:56,269
Sorry, Beemo.
I earned this loot.

192
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,433
<i>Those chumps were not
framing themselves.</i>

193
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:01,171
See you around, Beemo.

194
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:03,042
Lorraine! Wait!

195
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:05,173
What about the sock,
Lorraine?

196
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,841
Oh. That old thing?

197
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,409
I hid that where no one would
ever find it --

198
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:13,185
in our secret
grown-up kissing spot.

199
00:10:13,257 --> 00:10:15,920
Remember?

200
00:10:15,993 --> 00:10:18,360
It was good to see you again,
Beemo.

201
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,728
'Til next time.

202
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:25,528
'Til next time, Lorraine.

203
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,236
You see, man?

204
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:30,468
That was really fun.

205
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,807
<i>You don't need
two socks to have fun.</i>

206
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:35,246
Yeah. I guess.

207
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:37,407
<i>But maybe it would have been
more fun with two socks.</i>

208
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:40,753
Finn! Finn!
I know where your sock is.

209
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,187
Huh?

210
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:44,281
It was in your pillow
this whole time. See?

211
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,327
Whoa!

212
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:47,621
Right on, Beemo!

213
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,356
Ronnie the Mouse stole it,

214
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,297
but Lorraine Chicken set him up
to kill Bebe.

215
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,335
But the flatfoots
busted Ronnie,

216
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:57,372
and Lorraine skedaddled
with the loot.

217
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,374
But Beemo solved the case!

218
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,740
Yay, Beemo!
Yeah! Yeah!

219
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,833
Yay, Beemo!

220
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:03,901
Yay!

221
00:11:03,978 --> 00:11:05,345
Yay, Beemo!

222
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,848
Our chicken's name
is Lorraine?

223
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,080
She's red-hot like
pizza supper.
