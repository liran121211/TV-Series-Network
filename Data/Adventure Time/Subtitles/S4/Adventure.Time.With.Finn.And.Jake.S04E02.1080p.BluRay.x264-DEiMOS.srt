1
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,073
Gleebull baybelgrapes!

2
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:40,737
You're just in time.

3
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,113
Baybel cuber spoon to watch
an incaldrible adventure

4
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:48,202
from days of old
on my holo-pyramid viewer.

5
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:52,854
Five stories, each relating to
one special theme.

6
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,339
See if you Graybels can guess
the theme

7
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,789
by the end
of the episode, okay?

8
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:03,047
Now sit back, relax,
and enjoy the show.

9
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:05,143
All right, Beemo.
We'll be back in an hour.

10
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:07,238
You sure you don't need anything
from the grocery kingdom?

11
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,406
No, I don't need anything.
Thank you.

12
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:11,318
Okay, goodbye, Finn and Jake.

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:12,387
Bye, Beemo.

14
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:14,265
Yeah, see you later,
Beemo.

15
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,199
Finn? Jake?

16
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:33,121
Well, hello there!

17
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:35,003
Oh, hello.
Who are you?

18
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:37,490
My name is Football.
What's yours?

19
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:40,896
- I am Beemo.
- Beemo, are you a robot?

20
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,034
Oh, no, Football.

21
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:44,595
I am a little living boy.

22
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,788
Oh!
That sounds wonderful, Beemo.

23
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:48,990
Will you teach me
about being alive?

24
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:51,942
Yes, Football.
Watch me.

25
00:01:57,098 --> 00:02:00,004
Oh!

26
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:11,834
Pee-ing!

27
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:13,927
Oh, Beemo!
That's fantastic!

28
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,979
Oh, thank you, Football!
It's really nothing!

29
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:18,326
What the?

30
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,463
You see, man?
I told you.

31
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:22,303
This is nuts.

32
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:24,186
Plus he's using my toothbrush.

33
00:02:24,264 --> 00:02:27,484
<i>No, man... that's my
toothbrush.</i>

34
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,975
Ugh!

35
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:34,099
"Prove that Beemo does weird
junk when nobody is around."

36
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:35,054
Check!

37
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,752
High five, buddy!

38
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:41,658
That was pretty weak.

39
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:43,793
Yeah, I was thinkin'
the same thing.

40
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,552
- Give it another go?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:48,730
That was better.
But we can do better.

42
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,144
<i>You mean even better!</i>

43
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:52,062
Let's back on up
and run at each other.

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,295
Okay.

45
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:56,713
Ready? Go!

46
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:57,675
Rrrrrr!

47
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,094
Uhhhhhh!

48
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:00,261
Yah!

49
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:01,542
Ohh, it kind of stings.

50
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:03,316
I like the pain.

51
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:05,733
Let's do another one!

52
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,718
Ready?

53
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:10,283
Yeah!

54
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,657
- Yaaaaaaah!
- Whoooooooo!

55
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:17,738
- Yaaaaaaaah!
- Whooooooooo!

56
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,027
- Jake!
- Yeah?

57
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:25,696
I know how we can do the most
ultimate high five ever!

58
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:28,142
You've gone crazy mad
with power lust...

59
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:30,131
and I'm lovin' it!

60
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:33,571
You ready to do this,
dude?

61
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:35,347
I've been ready this
whole time, dude!

62
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:36,518
Just waiting on you to
say when you're...

63
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,827
Super ultimate
high five, go!

64
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:40,602
Gah!

65
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,874
Whooooo!

66
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,116
Waaaaaaaaaaah!

67
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:47,604
Ugh!

68
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:49,555
A glass of delicious
nourishing water for milady.

69
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,624
Ahh!

70
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:56,478
Oh, yes!

71
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,850
Mwah!

72
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:08,911
Oh, man.

73
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:09,941
Uh...

74
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,358
oh, boy.

75
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:12,392
Oh...

76
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:13,421
oh...

77
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:15,554
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

78
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:20,094
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

79
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:22,290
Oh...
oh, whoa, oh, my glob...

80
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:25,061
ohh... oh.

81
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:27,298
Oh, glob.

82
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,249
Ch-e-e-e-eese.

83
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:44,413
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

84
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:49,563
Ah.

85
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:03,597
Ha ha!
Jingo jango!

86
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:07,680
Yeast on third,
flour on first,

87
00:05:07,756 --> 00:05:12,575
swell the dough,
fit to burst!

88
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:15,417
Awoooooooooo!

89
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:46,780
Well, this is it,
Cinnamon Bun...

90
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:49,795
the most perfect sandwich that
has ever existed

91
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:51,712
<i>or ever will exist</i>

92
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,380
within the confines of
space-time.

93
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:56,511
Will you do the honors?

94
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,605
Okay.

95
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:03,783
But... but you...
you didn't...

96
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,084
you didn't even
taste it!

97
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:19,586
Thanks, Princess.
Peace out.

98
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,148
Whaaa!

99
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:28,462
Blegh!

100
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:31,097
Gunther, something stinks.

101
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:34,356
Gunther, do you smell that?

102
00:06:34,438 --> 00:06:37,731
Gunther, stop playing
the keyboard!

103
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,215
Smells like
it's coming from...

104
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:45,510
Gunther, are you blowing it up
in here?

105
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:47,537
You are nasty, Gunther.

106
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:50,736
You got a nasty booty, mister!
Nasty!

107
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,685
Aw, don't be sad, stinky.

108
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:55,777
Come with daddy
and I'll make it all better.

109
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,613
Goodbye, Gunther!

110
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:02,447
Sorry, sweetie, but I'm never
gonna get any princesses

111
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,403
if you're stanking up
the place!

112
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:09,442
Blegh!
It still stinks in here!

113
00:07:09,524 --> 00:07:11,218
What the heck?!

114
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:14,060
Where's that smell
coming from?!

115
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,506
Oh, it's me.
I smell horrible.

116
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:22,404
Scrub, penguins!
Scrub harder!

117
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,724
We are not stopping until
the stench is completely gone!

118
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,411
Clean, clean, clean,
cah-clean.

119
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,134
Gunther! Guess what.

120
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:41,304
<i>It was me who was smelly,
not you.</i>

121
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:42,647
Wenk.

122
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:46,236
Sorry, I thought you
had a stank booty, Gunther.

123
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:47,837
My bad.

124
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:52,233
Although I have no idea how
my armpits got so stinky.

125
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:57,992
Wahhhhhhh!

126
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,271
Everyone's worthless
at this talent show.

127
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:12,194

Quit ripping off our act!

149

No!
I was gonna do it first!

- That's amazing!

157
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:33,659
Huh?

158
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:37,209

Oh, my gosh, you guys!

163
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:51,518
I just want to thank y'all
so much!

164
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:53,968
It means so much to me,

165
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:56,842
and I just wanted to say
I... I...

166
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:09,133
Finn and Jake win
the talent show!

167
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,552
What?!

168
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:11,719
Awesome.

169
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:16,802
That... was... awesome!

170
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,462
Oh-ho! Baybel!
That was easy, wasn't it?

171
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,098
Slimmin'?

172
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,645
I'm glad we all guessed
the theme so easily!

173
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:29,304
What? What's that?
You haven't guessed it?

174
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,437
Oh, I'm sorry.

175
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:34,802
Well, pause your viewer now
to think about it

176
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,651
before I blable it
to you.

177
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:44,575
The theme was
"The Five Senses."

178
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:46,065
You see?

179
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,687
<i>Look... Beemo saw his
reflection.</i>

180
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:53,091
<i>Finn and Jake touched their
hands together.</i>

181
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:56,500
<i>The Princess made a tasty
