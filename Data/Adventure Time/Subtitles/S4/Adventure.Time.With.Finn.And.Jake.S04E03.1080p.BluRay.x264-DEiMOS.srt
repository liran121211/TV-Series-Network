1
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:48,222
Stunts!

2
00:00:49,594 --> 00:00:51,437
Hyah!

3
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,772
Yeah!

4
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,607
Yo, Finn! Look what I found!

5
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,488
A vertical trampoline!

6
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:08,409
It's sticky.

7
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:09,865
Dude, it's a spider web.

8
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:11,199
Ohhh.

9
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:12,579
Well, cut me out, yo!

10
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,785
No way.

11
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:15,370
I'll stunt you out!

12
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:17,205
Whaaah!

13
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:19,336
I was thinking something
else would happen.

14
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:20,667
You got anything sharp?

15
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,128
<i>The only sharp thing I
had were my fingernails,</i>

16
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:24,758
but you made me cut them.

17
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:26,885
They were too long, Finn.

18
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:29,888
Aaaaah!

19
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:31,344
You broke the skin, dude!

20
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:34,647
I guess my fingernails are
really lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ng!

21
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:37,692
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

22
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:38,859
Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:39,902
Sorry.

24
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:41,069
It's cool, man.

25
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:42,647
Can you stretch us
out of here'?

26
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,822
Humph!

27
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:45,115
Hmphhhhh!

28
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,488
Humphhh!

29
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:47,489
Aghh!

30
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,334
I'm gonna take a nap while you
grow out your fingernails.

31
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,504
We'll make our escape
when I wake up.

32
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:01,962
You'll never escape!

33
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,510
We will all die in the web!

34
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:06,508
That's the circle of life.

35
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:07,554
That's not a circle.

36
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,598
That's, like...a straight line.

37
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,802
We don't make
the rules, man.

38
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:13,261
Well, don't
just give up.

39
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,471
And you're walking too fast.

40
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:16,477
You know I can't...

41
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:17,808
The spiders are back!

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,142
Try to stay calm.

43
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:21,648
Greet your fate with dignity.

44
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:25,073
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

45
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:26,149
We got to go, Jake!

46
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,072
Jake!

47
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:30,244
So, what?
You're not talking to me now?

48
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,741
No.

49
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:36,247
I'm just tired from setting
traps all day solo style.

50
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,702
Why are you mad?

51
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:39,833
I just said I was tired.

52
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:41,505
<i>But you're acting
like you're mad.</i>

53
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:42,707
I'm not mad!

54
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,963
Oh, look -- food...

55
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,294
that I caught.

56
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:48,425
In my web.

57
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:49,630
For us.

58
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,434
I spin webs, too, Ed.

59
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:54,681
Yeah, I know.

60
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:56,934
I try just as hard as you.

61
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:58,060
Hmm?

62
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,356
Well, go ahead, then.

63
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:02,151
Wrap them up for laters.

64
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:03,569
What's wrong, Barb?

65
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:04,816
What's going on there, Jake?

66
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:07,982
I can't!

67
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:10,318
You think I'm gross
when I spin my web!

68
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:11,573
What?!

69
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:12,869
I could see it on your face!

70
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:13,992
Tell me that you don't!

71
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:15,288
Uh...

72
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:18,994
I...uh...um...

73
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:22,046
You tell me you
don't find me gross!

74
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,044
Oh, get stuffed, Ed!

75
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,048
Barb!

76
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,756
You guys are sad.

77
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:37,728
Ugh! What is that sound?

78
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:40,683
Sick, dude!
She makes that sound, too?

79
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:45,020
Yeah, I guess, but she never
does it in front of me.

80
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:49,941
Anyway, it's not gross
when guys do it.

81
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:51,492
Dude, that's not cool.

82
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:52,739
You need to think
about what you say

83
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,162
and how that
affects your lady.

84
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:55,910
<i>How about how she affects me?</i>

85
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:57,331
I love her, man.

86
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:00,413
Hmm...huh?

87
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:01,619
Humph!

88
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,496
Oh, snap.

89
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:04,501
How long was I out?

90
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,298
Can someone tell me
why we fight --

91
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:09,924
Why she treats me like all
I do is make her feel bad?

92
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:11,925
Tell me, Glob.

93
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:14,302
Why don't you
ever answer me?!

94
00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:17,261
It's hard to step outside of
yourself when you're enmeshed

95
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:19,141
with another being.

96
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:23,066
Oh, Grod!
It's over! It's over!

97
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,107
Aaaaaaaah!

98
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:25,025
Wait!

99
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:25,943
What?

100
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,020
Ummmmm...

101
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:32,442
Right now, we got to real-talk
about your girlfriend.

102
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:34,744
I don't real-talk
with my food.

103
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:35,991
Uh...

104
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,703
We real-talk now,
or you're gonna be as single

105
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:41,500
as your stinky web squirter!

106
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:42,873
Yeah, right.

107
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:44,704
You just want to
get out of my web.

108
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:47,290
All you food ever
want to do is escape.

109
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:51,503
Y'all is always like in cahoots,
making plans not to be food.

110
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:52,883
I'm not in cahoots.

111
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:54,259
So, okay.

112
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:56,011
Eat your friend here.

113
00:04:57,592 --> 00:04:58,559
Okay.

114
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,511
No, Finn! What?!
Where is your heart?!

115
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:01,437
Look inside yourself!

116
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:02,434
This isn't you!

117
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:03,981
I'm gonna fake-eat you, man.

118
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,433
Oh. Word.

119
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:07,610
N-o-o-o-o-o-o!

120
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:10,062
Oh, my guts!

121
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:11,864
My guts everywhere!

122
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:13,566
Ohhhh! How could you?!

123
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:14,741
Aaaaah!

124
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:16,114
Okay, man.

125
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:17,740
You've earned my trust.

126
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,117
So let's do this.

127
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:20,789
Real-talk me, Bro.

128
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:22,117
Okay, first off, then,

129
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,293
how you're going about
this isn't working.

130
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:25,460
Am I right?

131
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:27,876
Yeah.

132
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,673
It's not working.

133
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:31,217
My way sucks.

134
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,091
Cool. Now we got to do
damage control --

135
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,047
healing the negs
energy at the source.

136
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,555
Yes, heal the
negsergies in me.

137
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:40,977
All right, uh...

138
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,646
Go find Barb a present.

139
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:49,147
That'll fix the first neg.

140
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,728
Can you do that?

141
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:53,485
Yeah, I can find her a present,
if you think that'll help.

142
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:55,237
I don't think it will.

143
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:57,034
But what do l know?

144
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:59,453
I'm just a big ol' dummy who
does everything wrong.

145
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:01,030
Ptoo!

146
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:01,955
Wheeeeee!

147
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:03,954
You're free-e-e-e-e!

148
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:04,909
Ugh!

149
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:05,788
Oh, man!

150
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:06,869
It's okay, Finn.

151
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:08,079
You bought us some time.

152
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:09,288
Yeah. Think fast.

153
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:10,749
What can we use?

154
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:14,756
There's nothing.

155
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:16,052
Just a bunch of nature.

156
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,552
I have a dumb idea.

157
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:21,801
Get her a present.

158
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:23,636
Hmph.

159
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:25,892
<i>When was the last time
she got me a present?</i>

160
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:27,849
What would she want, anyways?

161
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:29,900
<i>How do I know?
We never talk.</i>

162
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:32,070
Geez, what happened to my life?

163
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:33,691
All my friends are gone.

164
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:35,398
They all got kids now.

165
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:36,858
<i>Idon't have kids.</i>

166
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:38,784
All I have is Barb.

167
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:43,080
And she
treats me like a-a dingus!

168
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:46,625
Oh! Cool!

169
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:47,998
A sword!

170
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,455
Wow! Neat!

171
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:52,290
It's magic or something!

172
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:55,877
We can hang this up over our
mantel and snuggle by the fire

173
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,840
like we --
like we used to!

174
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:02,141
I'm gonna fix us, Barb!

175
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:04,059
Fix us!

176
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:06,137
All right, one...

177
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,096
two...

178
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:08,055
three!

179
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:09,852
Yo! What?

180
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:10,933
Shoot!

181
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:12,360
Here comes another one.

182
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:13,812
One, two, three!

183
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:16,113
My eyes!

184
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:17,815
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

185
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:20,321
Ha ha! Yes! Finally!

186
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,445
Good job!

187
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,452
Last chance for life.
Break out!

188
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:27,704
Yeah, you mommy!

189
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:31,332
Hey! What's going on here'?

190
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:32,254
Nothing.

191
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,125
Aah!

192
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:34,252
Oh!

193
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:36,254
Crabapples!

194
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,585
Where's Ed?

195
00:07:37,668 --> 00:07:40,342
Oh. Uh, he's getting you
an "I'm sorry“ gift.

196
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:42,890
He feels crazy about
making you cry.

197
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:45,184
He does'? Really?

198
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:46,977
Barb! Barb!

199
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,270
Ed?

200
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:50,723
Barb! Look!
Damage control!

201
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:51,807
Check it out!

202
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:53,313
I wrapped it up and everything!

203
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:55,736
Oh, Ed, I can't believe it!

204
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:57,404
Yeah! Come on! Open it!

205
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,902
I-I really just --

206
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:01,404
I-It's just so unlike you to --

207
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:05,033
What's this?

208
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:06,204
It's a sword.

209
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,406
I found it in the woods.

210
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,582
In the woods?!

211
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah. It's magical, though.

212
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:11,248
Check out the blade!

213
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:12,829
You got this for you, Ed.

214
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:16,507
No, I got it for us --
for snuggles by the fire!

215
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,300
We are never gonna snuggles

216
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,469
until you learn
to appreciate me!

217
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:21,921
Oh, really?

218
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:24,177
Well, I guess we're never gonna
eat again, either,

219
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:28,386
<i>'cause I catch the food and
your butt is dysfunctional!</i>

220
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,392
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

221
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:31,393
Yaaaaah!

222
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:32,940
Go! Run away, food!

223
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:34,733
We don't need you, apparently!

224
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,153
Just break up, you guys!

225
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:38,980
Do it for you!

226
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:40,906
Now what are you gonna eat?

227
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:42,358
Huh, Barb?

228
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:44,443
<i>I'm gonna eat you!</i>

229
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,529
Yo! That's wrong!

230
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:49,661
Who ca-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-res?!

231
00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:52,626
Aaah!

232
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,294
Aaaaaaaah!

233
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,667
We're free!

234
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:57,748
Aaaaaaaaaah!

235
00:08:57,832 --> 00:08:59,675
Eeee! Ohhhh! Aaaah!

236
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,842
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

237
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:03,671
No! No! No! Aah!

238
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:04,846
Oh, no.

239
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:06,799
You got that look
on your face.

240
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:08,350
You going back
to help that fool?

241
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:09,677
His wife's gonna eat him!

242
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,808
Spider marriage
is complicated.

243
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:14,356
Sometimes you just
got to mind your own biz.

244
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:16,900
Oh, help! Somebody help me!

245
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,941
Go with Glob.

246
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,399
Oof!

247
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:24,404
Mercy!

248
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:25,860
Aah! Oh! Ugh!

249
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:31,831
Ugh!

250
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:33,284
You little twerp!

251
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,119
Are you stupid Or something?!

252
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:36,579
Yeah, I'm stupid!

253
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:39,791
But I know something real --
you shouldn't eat your husband!

254
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:41,922
Whoa! Ugh!

255
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,851
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

256
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,732
Aaaaaah! Ohhhhhhhhhhh!

257
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:57,308
Yo. Smoothing things out?

258
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,608
Uh, not exactly.

259
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:04,315
Barb! Barb!

260
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:06,275
What's wrong, my love?

261
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:12,491
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargghh!

262
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:18,124
Aghh!

263
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:19,501
O-kay.

264
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,799
What is happening?!

265
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:28,848
Something we're not
supposed to see.

266
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,886
Oh, Ed.

267
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:35,846
We're parents!

268
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,352
Oh, sick!

269
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:39,399
I think there's
hope for us, Barb.

270
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:43,525
We can make a new start --
as a family.

271
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:48,324
Nice.

272
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,617
Think they're
gonna make it?

273
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:52,242
Love like theirs will
always find a way.

274
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:56,042
It'll crawl all up over you
and drain your body fluids,

275
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:59,711
<i>poisoning you slowly
until you pass out.</i>

276
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:01,209
Whaaaaaa!

277
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:03,416
Circle of life, Finn.

278
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:05,422
Circle of life.

279
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:07,219
Yeeeeoooohhhhh!
