1
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:40,792
Hey, friend.

2
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:41,986
Don't be afraid.

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,324
I'm a gypsy child like you,
running wild and crazy.

4
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:50,657
Hold on. Wow.

5
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,822
A falling star.

6
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:55,228
It's too far, though.

7
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:56,820
♪ Magic! ♪

8
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:58,159
You're welcome.

9
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,165
Hmm. Ah.

10
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:01,460
There.

11
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:02,658
Wait.

12
00:01:02,732 --> 00:01:03,926
Oh, glob.

13
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:06,660
He is here somewhere,
my brothers.

14
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,257
Glob, can you see Magic Man
on the sensor?

15
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:12,234
Yes, Gob. Our little brother
is very close.

16
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,530
- Hey, flip me.
- Okay.

17
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:18,730
I'm gonna activate the thingy
that drains his magic juice.

18
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:21,737
My juice!

19
00:01:21,804 --> 00:01:24,169
Not... flowing... right.

20
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:25,899
Dream on, honey.

21
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:27,768
You can't catch this.

22
00:01:29,238 --> 00:01:32,172
Magic away!

23
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:36,165
I think I see him.

24
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,038
Yes, I see him, as well.

25
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:40,666
- Hey, guys.
- What, Glob?

26
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:42,174
Nothing. Never mind.

27
00:01:45,777 --> 00:01:47,505
Wait. Wait.
Shh, shh! Shush!

28
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:49,066
I... wasn't --

29
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:51,134
You hear that?

30
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:56,843
It was totally silent
for like a whole second.

31
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:59,573
Huh. Oh, yeah.
Cool.

32
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:02,170
Sometimes we get
so wrapped up battling stuff,

33
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,509
we forget to --

34
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:08,775
Ooh!

35
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:13,348
Waaa... zoo!

36
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:14,678
Hey.

37
00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:17,512
Shhhhhh.

38
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,651
Arise.

39
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,312
Magic Man, you caused nothing
but turmoil and chaos

40
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:28,852
for us on Mars.

41
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,217
<i>We thought banishing you
to this world would help you</i>

42
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:33,448
see the light
of our utopian super-society.

43
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,920
Now, tell us --
what have you learned

44
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,512
in these past 200 years?

45
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:39,522
<i>Are you guys
talking to me?</i>

46
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:42,182
You know you made life
on Mars a nightmare.

47
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,150
Now we must return you
to Mars,

48
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:47,850
where vengeance
awaits thee.

49
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:49,915
That's not --

50
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:55,283
Magic Man! Get up!

51
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,089
Did it work? Is he gone?

52
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,559
Yep.

53
00:02:58,627 --> 00:03:00,527
They took my friend to Mars!

54
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:02,390
Fly me there
and help me save him!

55
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:04,690
Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't.

56
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:07,251
You see?
The transfer drained me.

57
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:09,263
I can probably barely float.

58
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:11,627
So I just got to wait
'til they kill your friend.

59
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:14,186
See ya!

60
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:15,527
- No!
- Whoa!

61
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:17,155
What do you mean
"kill"?

62
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,562
<i>They're gonna put him
on trial for my crimes.</i>

63
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,895
Ain't nobody gonna pardon
these crimes on my head --

64
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:23,728
not even the king of Mars!

65
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,131
And once he's dead,

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,497
my magic juice will return
to my body --

67
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,194
flowing through me
like moonlight

68
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:31,201
through the ghost
dance.

69
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:33,133
Squeeze!

70
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:34,692
I wish I could help...

71
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:35,758
except I don't!

72
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,235
You succubutt!

73
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:39,236
♪ Come on,
let's go to my house ♪

74
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,362
♪ Come on, let's go
to my house! ♪

75
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:49,530
How long have you had
this house?

76
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:51,596
Yes, that is true!

77
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:54,967
Well, I bet
there's something here

78
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,872
that can help me
save Jake.

79
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:59,273
There is, but you'll never
make it work.

80
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:01,036
What?! Where is it?!

81
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:04,372
I don't know!
Have you seen my trash palace?

82
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,808
Yeah, what's the deal?
This place is wrecked.

83
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:09,036
Ewww!
Ew!!

84
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,544
What am I stepping in?

85
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:12,578
That's where I blow my nose
all day.

86
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:13,578
Ugh!

87
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:16,306
Yes, welcome to my tower
of light.

88
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,142
Everyone is welcome to share
this magic kingdom --

89
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:20,306
squirrels...

90
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,438
black mold...

91
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:22,572
worms...

92
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:23,944
poison ivy...

93
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,743
tiny manticore.

94
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:27,840
Help me, you coward!

95
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,906
Magic Man, what is your
deal, for real?

96
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:31,381
<i>You tell me.</i>

97
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,280
Well, for one,
I think this house

98
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:36,044
is a reflection
of your sick brain.

99
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:37,278
Look at this. Yuck.

100
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:39,215
Who's this you're standing with
in this picture?

101
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:42,309
♪ Memories drift in and out
of my mind ♪

102
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:45,842
♪ And the little people
get left behind ♪

103
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,183
♪ So whatever ♪

104
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:52,244
All... right.

105
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:54,481
Well, I'm gonna keep digging
through this stuff

106
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,386
'til I find what
you're talking about.

107
00:04:56,456 --> 00:04:57,980
It's downstairs.

108
00:04:58,056 --> 00:05:01,955
- Huh? What?
- My special thing.

109
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:04,957
Whoa!

110
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:06,218
Holy crepes.

111
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,256
Ta-da!
Come on.

112
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:14,452
That's the thing --
my special thing.

113
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:16,551
A Martian transporter.

114
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:19,151
This can take me to Mars?!

115
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:21,058
Yeah.
My brothers gave it to me

116
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:22,686
when they banished me
to Earth.

117
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:25,888
They thought I'd learn love
and use it to go back home.

118
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:27,691
How do I do it?

119
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:29,253
You put your hands
on those thingies

120
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,161
and think stuff about
people.

121
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,494
But it's broken.
Hasn't worked in 200 years.

122
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:36,055
<i>But...
it has to work.</i>

123
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,725
It has to.

124
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:39,731
For Jake.

125
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,563
Huh-duh?!

126
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:48,158
Yaaaaaaaah!

127
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:51,226
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

128
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:55,726
Whoa!

129
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:03,003
Citizens of Mars,

130
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,403
King of Mars...

131
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:08,463
today, the most notorious fiend
in Martian history

132
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:11,336
stands before us --
Magic Man.

133
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:15,903
Stop!

134
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:21,074
Turn on the dark.

135
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:24,305
Okay, so we don't have footage
of these crimes,

136
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:27,106
but Grod's pretty good
at drawing, so...

137
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,735
"Plague of Shadows."

138
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,779
Magic Man brought
our shadows to life.

139
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:35,575
They attacked us
and ravaged Mars.

140
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,203
Very impressive, Grod.

141
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,406
Thanks, bro.

142
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,074
To the "Plague of the
One-ness."

143
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:44,479
As we gathered to hold hands
and sing our community song,

144
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:46,913
Magic Man cast an evil spell

145
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:49,745
that made our arms
grow together.

146
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:51,578
Much suffering ensued.

147
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,311
And what about that one time

148
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:55,442
when he turned all the water
into hair

149
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:58,145
and we all got so thirsty,
we drank it?

150
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,413
And when we drank it,
we went bald?

151
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,180
Many of us did not recover
and, to this day,

152
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:06,243
hide our loss
behind groovy headgear.

153
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,413
Dark off, please.

154
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:11,922
Magic Man, it bums me out
to see this.

155
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:14,047
I remember when
you were really cool,

156
00:07:14,123 --> 00:07:17,886
before that night you spent on
Olympus Mons with Margles.

157
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:20,586
Aw, man!

158
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:22,521
Force field.

159
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:24,149
What happened, Magic?

160
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:25,487
Why did you go crazy?

161
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:29,015
If you had just learned to care
about living things again,

162
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:31,650
you could have come back
whenever you wanted.

163
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:35,422
Well... you guys are missing
some important details.

164
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:37,758
I'm Jake the dog.
Listen.

165
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:44,155
You sad Magic Man.

166
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,925
Instead, you bummed around Ooo

167
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:49,590
acting like a jerk
for 200 years.

168
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:52,257
Yeah, that's true,
except I'm not Magic Man!

169
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:55,232
Now! Ready the Wand
of Disbursement!

170
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:56,287
Ready.

171
00:07:56,365 --> 00:08:01,062
Space dome, open!

172
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:03,931
Oh, snap!

173
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:08,393
Magic Man, I give you
two choices --

174
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:10,868
one is total
annihilation.

175
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,596
The wand will touch you,

176
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,932
and your soul
will meet with death.

177
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:17,470
The second is to use
the power of the wand

178
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:20,596
to convert your body
to living stardust,

179
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:23,036
where your consciousness
will be jettisoned

180
00:08:23,105 --> 00:08:24,629
into the infinite cosmos

181
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:28,765
on an endless journey of wonder
and discovery!

182
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,807
Wow. That second one
sounds pretty cool.

183
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:34,433
I mean, yeah, I'm like way
into that.

184
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:38,170
Except -- ohh -- I would really
miss my best friend.

185
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:39,676
His name is Finn.

186
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:42,336
And I think it would mess him up
if I wasn't around.

187
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,207
Wait -- did you say
you would miss someone?

188
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:46,108
Yeah.

189
00:08:46,178 --> 00:08:48,543
<i>And that someone
would miss you?</i>

190
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,841
Yeah, that's me,
you dishrags!

191
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:01,842
I win again!
Just like always!

192
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:04,780
Jakey, no!

193
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,714
Look.

194
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,272
It's the dog.

195
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,045
The one you were prophesied
to meet.

196
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,913
I don't care none
for that mess!

197
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,713
This wouldn't have glomped
if you'd just listened to my bro!

198
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:16,774
You bunked up, King of Mars!

199
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:19,182
The wisest, most honest super
being of all time

200
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:22,118
just put an innocent dog
to deads!

201
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,450
You're right,
Finn the Human.

202
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:26,420
My judgment was less
than the standard

203
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:28,784
by which I judge
my peers.

204
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:30,220
Of which I have none.

205
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:33,620
I will retrieve your friend
from the 37th dead world.

206
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:37,487
Ooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaah!

207
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:44,218
Death.

208
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,454
King of Mars.
What's your business?

209
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:49,653
I need this one back.

210
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:53,661
Hmm.
What will you give me for him?

211
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:58,494
Not this time, your majesty.

212
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:04,892
In that case, I offer
my immortality.

213
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,124
Deal.

214
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:12,355
Huh?

215
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:14,365
Hey! I'm alive!

216
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:16,422
Yay!
King of Mars saved you!

217
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,798
Yes, but at what cost?

218
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:21,959
Oh, man.

219
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:23,365
Should we go get Magic Man?

220
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:25,663
No. I lost a friend.

221
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:27,862
I cannot lose my brother,
as well.

222
00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:29,960
Hey, what? Where did they go?

223
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:32,129
Eat my skids!

224
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,534
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

225
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:35,298
Oh, Margles.

226
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:37,134
Magic Man!

227
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:38,297
Huh?

228
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:39,634
Bam!

229
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,331
You're back, coward!

230
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,838
Go! Get out of here,
tiny manticore!

231
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:48,671
Whatevs!
I didn't need your pity help!

232
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:50,402
Geez. What?

233
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:52,942
<i>I am the true coward.</i>

234
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:54,873
Hiding from sincere expressions

235
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:56,932
like a vampire in the nude

236
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:58,671
who hides from the light.

237
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:00,506
Thank you, brave hero.

238
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,635
I was freed from bottle jail,

239
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,473
but my new prison is shame.

240
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,207
My new prison is shame!

241
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,678
What's he saying?

242
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:12,373
He said, "my new prison
is shame."
