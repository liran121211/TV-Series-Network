Yeah, man.

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,148
- What?
- Nice.

8
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,883
Hey,
princess Bubblegum.

9
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:00,952
Hey, everybody.

10
00:01:00,954 --> 00:01:03,990
Finn's here!
Yay!

11
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:17,708
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,079
Man, dancing is rough.

13
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,082
Yeah.
I'm having some sweat issues

14
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,851
here.
I'll go get us some snack-ity

15
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:35,262
- juice.
- Hey, man. I'm Jake.

16
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:39,335
I'm Jake.
Hmm.

17
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:41,938
Check it out, Jake.
I got us some peanuts...

18
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,076
And punch!

19
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:58,059
Pbht! Choking!

20
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:02,564
Don't give up on me, man.

21
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:04,667
Hyah!

22
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:12,744
Yay!

23
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:16,516
- Whoa, Finn. Nice book!
- Yeah. It's pretty cool.

24
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:19,386
It's the enchiridion -- the
hero's handbook.

25
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:22,156
Hey, guy.

26
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:24,259
Are you all right?

27
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,495
He's all good.

28
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:29,131
Everybody get back to your
dancing.

29
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:38,377
Uh, Finn?
I think that bear is following

30
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,912
- us home.
- Whoa.

31
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,981
I think you're right.

32
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:46,620
Hey, bear.
You gonna come hang out with us?

33
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:51,226
What do you say, bear?

34
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:55,097
- Awesome.
- I don't know, Finn.

35
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,467
- This guy seems kind of weird.
- Yeah.

36
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,237
He's totally weird.

37
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,544
Hmm.

38
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:08,982
Jake. Hey, Jake.
Jake?

39
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:10,818
- What?
- Come here.

40
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,254
- You got to check this out.
- Yeah, okay.

41
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:15,991
Check this out, man.
This bear is tops blooby!

42
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:18,761
Watch this.

43
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:19,963
Ah...
Ah...

44
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:21,699
...Choo!
...Choo!

45
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,601
You got to try this, Jake.

46
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:29,375
He does everything I do.

47
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:34,448
Oh, stop.

48
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,252
Come on, Jake. Try it.
It's awesome!

49
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:40,356
Um, yeah, okay.

50
00:03:40,358 --> 00:03:43,260
Sweepy, sweepy, sweepy!

51
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:45,862
Sweep, sweep, sweep!
Sweeping.

52
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:52,137
He's got me down pat.
Sweeping's weak.

53
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,842
Mm.
Sweeping weak.

54
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:58,412
Whoa!
This guy's all right.

55
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:01,883
This guy just busted me
in my chops, Finn.

56
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:04,019
Hey, come on.
He's just a bear.

57
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:08,258
- He don't know nothing.
- Mm. Yeah, I guess.

58
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,594
Well, anyway, it's getting
pretty late.

59
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:14,132
Probably time for everyone to go
back home to their own houses.

60
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:16,602
Yeah, I guess you're
right, Jake.

61
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:19,306
It is pretty late.
He should probably stay here

62
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:23,377
tonight.
You can sleep in the bathtub.

63
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,379
- Brathtrub.

64
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:27,416
- Sleep in.
- "Brathtrub!"

65
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:29,751
This guy's tops blooby.

66
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:41,033
- Finn?

67
00:04:56,454 --> 00:05:00,091
What?

68
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:06,131
Hey, princess Bubblegum.
Hey, everybody.

69
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:12,873
What? Hey.
Hey, princess Bubblegum.

70
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:20,516
Hey, everybody. What? Hey.

71
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:22,119
Aah!
What are you doing?

72
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,454
Shh. Come with me.
You got to see something.

73
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:27,492
This bear's wiggy, Finn.
He's wearing your clothes and

74
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,629
- dancing around all crazy.
- That sounds rad, man.

75
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,033
What?!
No. Just --

76
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:39,207
- Aw, man!

77
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:41,777
Oh, you got to believe
me, Finn.

78
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:44,180
I swear.
He was, like, all wigged out.

79
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:46,984
He was dancing.

80
00:05:46,986 --> 00:05:49,353
- I do believe you.
- Oh.

81
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:51,756
It's just, you know,
who cares?

82
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:54,527
Dancing, wearing clothes -- he
ain't hurting nobody.

83
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:57,831
He's just doing it up, you know?
He's just cool, and he likes my

84
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,499
style.
That ain't a crime.

85
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:01,869
No.
I guess not.

86
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:04,439
Okay, great.
I'm going back to bed.

87
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:06,909
- You coming, smart guy?
- Yeah, okay.

88
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:29,537
Ahh!
Ahh!

89
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,807
<i>You're not even a
little weirded out by this?</i>

90
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,844
No, man.
He's just doing his instincts.

91
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:35,345
He's just doing his
instincts.

92
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:37,582
He's like a parrot or
chameleon or something.

93
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:39,517
...like a parrot or chameleon
or something.

94
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,086
He's funny.
He's funny.

95
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:45,358
Anyway, I got to go
pick up beemo from soccer.

96
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,094
I'll be back soon.
And remember -- don't eat my

97
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:51,599
special Finn cakes.
Finn only.

98
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:53,969
Yeah, I get it.
You don't need to tell me that

99
00:06:53,971 --> 00:07:04,048
every time you make Finn cakes.
Bah!

100
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,655
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

101
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:13,593
Why, you little...
Trying to set me up, eh?

102
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:18,167
You think you're so smart, but
this time, I'm ready.

103
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,782
Oh, my glob! What?!
Jake! You ate all my Finn cakes.

104
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,286
- What the stink?!
- Uh, nope.

105
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:35,556
The bear did it, and I've got
proof.

106
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:37,724
- I taped the whole thing!
- The bear ate all my

107
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:40,328
cakes, and you just sat there
and watched him do it?!

108
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,066
- What's wrong with you!?
- Uh, what? No, man.

109
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:46,870
He was trying to frame me, Finn!
He's trying to steal your

110
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:49,573
identity!
Why can't you grok that!?

111
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:51,509
He's a bear, Jake.

112
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:53,679
He's a wild animal.
He doesn't know things.

113
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,082
- He just does stuff. He's cool.
- Oh, fine.

114
00:07:57,084 --> 00:08:00,853
Well, that's just great.
Then you and m.C. Cool friend

115
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,491
can go stink it up together at
your stupid, cool Finn party all

116
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,962
by yourselves, 'cause I'm not
going!

117
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:09,498
Wait -- what?
What party?

118
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,270
What? Your party, man.
Tonight? In the woods?

119
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:18,276
But I didn't make this
flyer.

120
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,045
Huh?
Well, who did, then?

121
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:26,152
The bear.

122
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:26,988
I knew it.

123
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:31,560
See, dude?

124
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:35,064
He's not just jacking your
style, he's jacking your whole

125
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:37,568
you!
Jacking yo' you up.

126
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,439
- What the what?
- He got in close and

127
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:44,109
used you.
Now he's feeding nuts to your

128
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:46,445
ex-girlfriend.
- Sure, I'll have

129
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:50,417
- another nut.
- She's not my -- we

130
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:54,922
- never went steady.
- Bleh.

131
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:57,226
He's trying to replace

132
00:08:57,228 --> 00:09:00,864
you, and he's already got
everyone convinced he's you!

133
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:05,136
He didn't really like you.
He used you.

134
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:14,081
Troops brooby!
Troops brooby! Troops...

135
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,349
Ow!

136
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:17,752
Not cool, man.

137
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:21,357
You're not me.
You're just a bear acting like

138
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:28,700
me.

139
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,269
It's okay, everyone.
The imposter is gone.

140
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,206
Finn, nobody
really thought the bear was you.

141
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,476
- Wait. What?
- We just thought it

142
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:39,914
was one of your jokey-joke
jokes.

143
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,758
- Hey! Hey, bear!
- Wait up, guy.

144
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,062
Hey, I -- I didn't mean

145
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:54,566
to make you feel so bad about
yourself.

146
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:57,269
- I'm really sorry about that.
- Me, too.

147
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:00,773
But you're a super-rad
bear, so why not just be you?

148
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:07,682
- I want be hero like you!
- Aww.

149
00:10:07,684 --> 00:10:11,587
I guess he's got a
heart of gold after all.

150
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:14,657
Hold on, bear.
I got something for you.

151
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:17,495
It's the enchiridion -- the
hero's handbook.

152
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:22,134
Everything you need to know
about being a hero is in this

153
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:25,805
book.
Take it and learn.

154
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:28,776
Finn, are you nuts?
We can't give that book away.

155
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,945
- It's, like, crazy important.
- Whatever, man.

156
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:33,281
We never use it except for,
like, sitting on it when the

157
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:37,821
grass is wet and stuff.
Drink your fill of knowledge.

158
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:42,827
Someday, you'll be a great hero.
Thank you, Finn.

159
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,364
Thank you.

160
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:10,095
Ooooh!
Did you bring the book?

161
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:14,201
Yes. One step closer.
