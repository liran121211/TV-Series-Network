1
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:48,333
That was awesome!
All right, all right, my turn.

2
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,007
You guys are full

3
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:00,308
- of magic air.

4
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,344
Gross!

5
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:04,312
No!

6
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,982
Princess?
You...Okay?

7
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,651
Yeah.
It's just...The air smells bad

8
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,586
from your magic tricks, and now
I feel sad.

9
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:16,523
I left all my scented candles at
the castle.

10
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:19,358
They'd really cut through the
magic stank.

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,827
Just go back to the
fire kingdom and get them --

12
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:24,162
problem solved.
Then I'll have to

13
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:26,197
see my dad.
I'm still mad at him for

14
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:29,533
imprisoning me in that lantern.
So unfair!

15
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:33,302
Uh...We can go get

16
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:34,637
them?
Really?

17
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:38,207
That would be really nice.
But don't let my pops see you.

18
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:41,609
<i>I don't want his majesty
thinking I need anything from</i>

19
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:43,445
him.

20
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:45,846
It ain't me!

21
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:49,116
Whoa!

22
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,284
Oh!

23
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:54,053
Flambo!
For a second I thought the

24
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:56,888
- princess was farting.
- Flambo, we need you to

25
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,357
cast "flame shield" on us.
All right!

26
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,076
These candles must be
they.

27
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:25,378
They smell
like an old lady's bathroom.

28
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,847
Hey!
Don't disrespect my lady!

29
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,049
I say it as a
compliment!

30
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:32,184
Like it reminds me of my
grandma.

31
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:36,921
I love my grandma.
No one come-s-s-s here.

32
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,591
Not s-since flame princes-s-s

33
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:44,160
fled the cas-s-tle.
Now gues-s-s what we're gonna

34
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:48,030
- kill flame king with.
- A conspirator

35
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:51,032
with a hiss voice!
How about...Water?

36
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:53,935
Even wors-s-e!
We'll us-s-e ic-c-e!

37
00:02:53,937 --> 00:02:57,371
And a conspirator with
an untied shoe!

38
00:02:57,373 --> 00:03:01,274
Ice? Why ice?
'Cause it's more painful, you

39
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:04,410
s-s-impleton!
Cold as ic-c-e ball-s-s!

40
00:03:04,412 --> 00:03:07,279
A perfect death for
the flame king!

41
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:10,015
Did you hear

42
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:11,582
- that?

43
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:14,352
Jake, come on!
We got to stop those guys from

44
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:18,622
- killing flame princess' dad!
- Right, right.

45
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:23,292
Dirt bags!
Where'd they go?

46
00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:41,941
Hey, is that new?
Yeah, I think it is.

47
00:03:41,943 --> 00:03:44,543
Yes, it is new.
Hmm, what do you guys think

48
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:46,311
of this painting?
I like it.

49
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:49,447
Hey, is this one of those
paintings where the eyes follow

50
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:52,082
- you?

51
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:01,089
Hmm. Hmm.
Come on, let's get out of

52
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,658
here.
I don't want to miss snack time.

53
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,793
Snacks!
Snacks!

54
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:08,996
- Snacks!
- Snacks! Snacks! Snacks!

55
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,799
Now what?

56
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:15,168
...and most unnatural
murder-s-s.

57
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,003
Hear that?
It sounds like a voice with a

58
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:20,339
- hiss.
- The kind we are looking

59
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:22,274
for!
The s-serpent that did

60
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:23,942
s-sting...
- Stop!

61
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:26,978
...thy father's life, now
wears hi-s-s crown-s-s!

62
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,080
- Dude, the voice!
- We must follow the

63
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:32,082
voice!

64
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,987
To die, to s-sleep, to

65
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:41,623
s-sleep, perchance to dream...
- Which way is the hiss

66
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,658
voice coming from?
Aye, there's the rub, for in

67
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,328
- that s-sleep of death...
- This way!

68
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,798
- ...what dream-s-s may come.
- Which way?

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,468
I s-seem to be s-saying a lot
about our s-super-s-secret

70
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,005
- plan...
- To the left!

71
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,206
You!

72
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:07,611
- You! You! You!
- Double you! Double you!

73
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,312
I don't think it's
them.

74
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:11,947
Double you! Double you!

75
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:18,720
Whoa!

76
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:21,222
- Jake!
- I'm okay!

77
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:24,725
I think I hear that hissing
voice down this way!

78
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,693
Whoa!

79
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:29,495
- Why didn't you catch me?
- Oops!

80
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:33,332
Tell me next time.
I can't think in the future.

81
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:38,803
- Vent ahead.
- Jake, I want to see.

82
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:50,679
- No hissing.

83
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:56,183
No untied shoe.
Vent.

84
00:05:56,185 --> 00:05:59,754
This needs something more!

85
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:03,757
- Yes! Yes!
- That's the Stuff!

86
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,092
Whoa! It's him!

87
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:09,728
- Hmm?
- My bluebies!

88
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,730
You buffoon!
Where's your partner with the

89
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,666
untied shoe?
What partner?

90
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,402
What are you blueberries
talking about?

91
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:20,370
Give it up, man!
I heard your hiss voice!

92
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:24,840
- I don't have a voice!
- There's a snake on your

93
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,909
- shoulder!
- What?

94
00:06:26,911 --> 00:06:28,344
Aah!

95
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,778
Hmm.

96
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,579
Suffering...

97
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:34,782
...Succotash!
Now to chop you two big

98
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:38,519
blueberries into small,
bite-sized blueberries!

99
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:42,288
Shakespeare.

100
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,857
Five minutes to curtain,
everyone!

101
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:49,695
- Five minutes!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

102
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:57,867
Ooh!

103
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:02,905
Oh!
Pfft! Actors!

104
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:12,213
What's going on with
the costumes?

105
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:15,382
This is a theater troupe!
We're getting ready to perform

106
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,950
for the king!
Everyone in the kingdom shall be

107
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:20,453
in attendance!
Of course, you know all this,

108
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:24,489
being fellow actors from the
exact same troupe.

109
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:27,325
I have an idea.
We'll go onstage, act like two

110
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,827
conspirators.
You will have one shoe untied, I

111
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:32,896
will talk with a hiss voice.
We'll talk about how we want to

112
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:35,298
kill the king.
As we do this, we'll study the

113
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,000
faces of the audience and look
for guilty reactions.

114
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:40,335
- That's brilliant!
- Thanks!

115
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:47,274
It's an original idea by me.

116
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:50,777
- Ahem! Hey, conspirator!
- Hey, co-conspirator!

117
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:54,013
Let's talk about how
we're gonna kill the king!

118
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,648
Shh!
S-somebody might hear our evil

119
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,419
<i>plot!
Man, I am so lost.</i>

120
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:05,790
Psst! The audience!
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

121
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,492
Uh, uh...

122
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,594
You think that's one of
them?

123
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,462
Maybe.
Let's keep going.

124
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:16,866
- So, what are you packing?
- Water, man -- enough of

125
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:21,703
it to put out the king's fire!
Uh, uh...Hmm.

126
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:25,506
I think he's starting

127
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:26,840
to crack.
Water?

128
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:29,142
You know what's even more
painful?

129
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:32,178
If we pour ice in his ear!
That's how we'll kill

130
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,679
the flame king!
Pbht!

131
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:39,384
Kill the flame king?
This is treason disguised as a

132
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,218
play!
Guards, seize them!

133
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,554
What?! No!

134
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,222
Please!
We were trying to warn you about

135
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,024
assassins!
Hmm.

136
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:51,460
- Search them!

137
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:53,629
Huh?

138
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:56,231
Sire, it's your daughter's
scented candles!

139
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,332
Sickos!

140
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:01,802
- Off with their heads!
- Whoa, what?!

141
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:04,571
No, please!

142
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:09,041
S-stay s-still.
"S-still"?

143
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:12,344
Untied shoelace?

144
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:17,081
It's them!
S-so long, s-suckers!

145
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,049
Naked babies, naked
babies, naked babies!

146
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:20,717
Naked babies, naked babies,
naked babies!

147
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:23,353
Naked babies, naked babies,

148
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,421
naked babies!

149
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:28,090
We found 'em!
The executioners are the real

150
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,091
king-killers!
S-silence!

151
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:32,727
Wait, wait, wait...That
voice.

152
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:35,830
Guards, take off their hoods!
Aah!

153
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:38,866
My identity!

154
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:41,367
Ugh!

155
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:45,238
Furnius and torcho!
Hello...Uncle!

156
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,108
Arrest the executioners!

157
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,011
Hmm...I thought I had you two

158
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:57,914
extinguished.
You cannot quench the

159
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:02,551
flame-s-s-s of revenge!
You snuffed out our father to

160
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:04,920
become king!
Oh, yeah...Ha ha.

161
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,289
Take them to the punishment
room!

162
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,425
I'll des-s-Troy all of you...
Release me!

163
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:14,628
- ...with ic-c-c-e!
- Wait, so you -- you

164
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,464
extinguished their dad?
Mm-hmm.

165
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:20,466
And...Everyone is evil
here?

166
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:25,303
<i>Mm-hmm -- all evil.</i>

167
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:28,640
Then...Is
flame princess...Evil?

168
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:30,941
Or maybe chaotic neutral?
She's evil.

169
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:33,611
Okay...So your
daughter's evil -- we've

170
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:36,646
established that.
But do you think if a good guy

171
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:40,316
really liked her...Could he
change her to good?

172
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:44,052
Hmm, well, there'd be
penalties to her experience if

173
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:47,221
she acted out of alignment,
