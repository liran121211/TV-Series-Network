1
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:36,300
Aah! My arm!

2
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,367
Ohh! My face!

3
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,005
Hmm.

4
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,474
This happens sometimes.

5
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:51,554
Wait, what?!

6
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:52,647
Oh, my gosh!

7
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,522
How many times do
I have to tell you?

8
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:56,857
Somebody broke into my
house and stole my lumps!

9
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:01,326
Peebo?

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,460
Hey, hey, how-a mah haah!

11
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:05,400
Eww!

12
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:06,369
Uh...

13
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:07,427
Okay. Calm down.

14
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:09,667
How am I supposed
to calm down?

15
00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:13,007
Lumping thief is out there,
getting fresh with my lumps!

16
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:14,443
Gross.

17
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:17,647
Whoa! Whoa!

18
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:21,550
Gals, we'll find this crazy
freak and return all of your body parts.

19
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,384
Thank you so much, Finn!

20
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:30,221
I shall give you a kiss.

21
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:35,397
It's... it's okay,
Hot Dog Princess.

22
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:37,128
We'll be right back.

23
00:01:38,137 --> 00:01:40,662
I said I don't know!

24
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,039
I have nothing
to do with this.

25
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:44,268
Stop lying.

26
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:46,743
We found your fingerprints
at the crime scene.

27
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:48,211
What?! Really?!

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,406
Uh... no.

29
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:53,307
Oh, well, then why
would you say that?

30
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:55,319
Ice King,
we know you did it!

31
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:57,947
Finn, I'm as
concerned as you are.

32
00:01:58,023 --> 00:01:59,752
There's some sicko out there.

33
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:02,316
<i>What if he comes
after my Princess?</i>

34
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:03,691
<i>Your Princess?</i>

35
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:04,820
Yeah.

36
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:08,424
Let me introduce
you to my new wife.

37
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:14,033
Oh, wait, you mean I'm
the guy stealing all the p...

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,701
Yeah, okay.
I get it now.

39
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,741
What happened to them,
husband?

40
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,310
Hmm?

41
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:30,218
Um, ah!

42
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,313
They're sleepy.

43
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,688
They're our limp,
sleepy children.

44
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,748
Come on, wife.

45
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:36,692
Let's have a nice
family meal.

46
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:37,592
Okay.

47
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:48,065
Wife, you sit right here.

48
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:55,106
Isn't this nice?

49
00:02:57,683 --> 00:03:00,015
Uh-oh.

50
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:02,553
I mean, that's good.

51
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:04,955
Oops!

52
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:06,991
How fun! You're so fun!

53
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:09,726
Mmm.

54
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:14,925
Oh, marriage is fun.

55
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:18,093
See?

56
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,731
When you wash and I dry,
we get done faster.

57
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:26,301
And then tomorrow night,
we switch.

58
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,346
Here.

59
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:32,611
Let me show you a trick,
my darling.

60
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:34,083
See?

61
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:36,643
You let it soak, and then
we'll wash it in the morning.

62
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:40,183
Enough chores.

63
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:41,556
Come along, dear.

64
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:44,425
I want to show you
something special.

65
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:54,733
♪ Let me show you
something special ♪

66
00:03:56,108 --> 00:04:03,674

77
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:54,890
Here it is.

78
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,958
I hope you like it.

79
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,266
Hmm.

80
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:07,938
You like?

81
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:10,641
Is there something
wrong with me?

82
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:14,584
The way I am...
it's not normal, is it?

83
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:17,019
Oh, pretty baby wife.

84
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:20,024
You're the most normal
thing in my whole life.

85
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:24,153
We're like two normal jelly
beans sitting at the bottom of the jar,

86
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,094
floating in a sea of olives,

87
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:29,224
waiting for somebody to guess how
many jelly beans are in the jar,

88
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,563
which I mentioned.

89
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:33,002
I don't think I understand.

90
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:37,201
Just look into my eyes and
know that everything is okay.

91
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:42,704
Are you feeling normal yet?

92
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:46,681
Okay.

93
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,450
See that?

94
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:55,220
We're normal, just like
the normal people are.

95
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:56,760
Oh.

96
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,857
Lady, don't take my pizza.

97
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:04,231
Huh? What's a...

98
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,400
M-m-mons... mons... mons...

99
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,460
Finn, what?

100
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,836
Are you saying "Mama"?
What are you?

101
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:10,374
Hi!

102
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:12,672
M-m-m-monster!

103
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:14,302
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

104
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:15,812
Aah! Ugh.

105
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,115
Oh, don't mind the kids.

106
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:21,550
It's just a phase.

107
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:27,221
I need a glass of water.

108
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:28,486
Oh, I'll go get...

109
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,461
No. It's okay. I'll get it.

110
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:38,535
You are not normal.

111
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:41,367
You are a monster!

112
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,668
Hey, hey, hey.

113
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,039
Monster! A monster!

114
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,237
What's going
on in here?

115
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:49,075
Nobody's a monster.

116
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:52,674
All I see in this room is
a young, kind-hearted,

117
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:55,015
intelligent, hot-looking
Ice King

118
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:57,647
and his beautiful
Princess bride.

119
00:06:57,723 --> 00:06:59,213
That's you, sweetie.

120
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,418
I don't feel beautiful.

121
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:03,859
I feel like a freak.

122
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:06,454
I will prove to you that
you are beautiful.

123
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:18,102
To me, my penguins.

124
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,768
Goonter, Gunther, Gunder,

125
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,472
Goonder, come on!

126
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:24,282
Gunter, Gunthe,

127
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:26,817
Gaunter, Ginther, follow!

128
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:33,383
Don't rearrange the chairs,
please.

129
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,859
You're all gonna clap and cheer,
or I'm gonna smack your buns.

130
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:51,169
Whoo! Yeah!

131
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:54,636
Clap louder.

132
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:56,146
You got to be all "Whoo!"

133
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:06,957
If you look at her
with these mirrors,

134
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:09,152
her ugliness will
have no effect on us.

135
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:10,922
Well, where is she?

136
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:12,293
Oh, I think she's right over...

137
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:19,971
Hey!

138
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:32,344
Baby, you want to
talk about it?

139
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:36,917
You should just find
another Princess to marry.

140
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:39,081
I'm unlovable!

141
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:42,251
Girl, I love you as much as all
the other Princesses in the

142
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:44,022
world combined.

143
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:46,563
You don't really mean that.

144
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:48,496
I'll prove it.

145
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,529
See?

146
00:08:55,607 --> 00:08:59,270
You have Elbow Princess' hips and
Doctor Princess' heart and intestines,

147
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:02,438
Slime Princess' bottom.

148
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:06,974
You have all my favorite parts
of my favorite Princesses.

149
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:11,546
I'm... just... a bunch...
of stolen parts?

150
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:13,853
Oh, the parts don't matter.

151
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,620
<i>It's you that matters.</i>

152
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:18,754
But who am I?

153
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,664
You're my wife, and I will
always love my wife,

154
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:24,224
no matter what.

155
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:29,763
You'd love me even without
these other Princesses' parts?

156
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,069
Sure, baby.

157
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:33,610
Even without all
your fine lady parts.

158
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:35,407
Now give us a hug.

159
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,879
Mmm.

160
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,279
Hey, Ice King!

161
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,715
Huh?!

162
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:41,217
Your wife's face can't
make us faint anymore.

163
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,416
Don't listen to them, babe.
They're being negative.

164
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:45,615
Haahh!

165
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,248
Aah!

166
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:49,122
Run, my happiness.

167
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:50,991
I'll distract them with
ice magi...

168
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:54,827
Ouch.

169
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:57,593
Aha!

170
00:09:57,669 --> 00:09:58,567
Aah!

171
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:00,868
Yaaahhh!

172
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,702
Aah!

173
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:04,605
Aah!

174
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:06,473
You give up?

175
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:07,602
Yes!

176
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:10,475
I give up.

177
00:10:10,548 --> 00:10:11,776
Finally.

178
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,148
Let's get those princess
parts back to the ladies.

179
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:15,618
Yeah, mans.

180
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:17,552
Wait, where'd your wife go?

181
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,517
Huh?

182
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,322
Let me go! Let me go!

183
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:05,495
Though my parts be scattered,
I shall always be your wife.

184
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:09,273
She...

185
