00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,857
- Whatcha think?
- I can make that driz,

6
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,025
- no problem.
- It's crazy far, man.

7
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:40,892
Nah, that's just a
perspecto illusion.

8
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:43,058
It looks far 'cause the cliff's
lower.

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,059
- Eh, go for it.
- Whoo!

10
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:49,526
- Shoot!

11
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:51,594
- Almost.
- Not really.

12
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:53,427
What?!
Watch me, fool.

13
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,695
Hup!

14
00:00:56,697 --> 00:00:59,895
Whoo!
I did it!

15
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:03,895
Sike!

16
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,563
Hey, you know what?
This is cool just having bro

17
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:09,063
- time for once.
- What, like no ladies?

18
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:12,198
Or dudes or whatevs.
It's just a chore sometimes.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,530
Yeah, two people is mad
efficient.

20
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,598
- Whoa!
- It's a beach brawl!

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,532
Looks like they're
trying to drown a barn.

22
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:22,432
That's not a barn.
That's a dude!

23
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:27,366
Holy fizzle.

24
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:30,967
What's going on here, tough boy?
What is that huge dude?

25
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:34,801
He's the farm, the legendary
fighter of the shiney isles.

26
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,702
I came here to participate in
his open challenge, but this

27
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:41,702
mother can't be beat!
Give up, worms!

28
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:47,203
My fight power is supreme!
I'm too freaking legendary for

29
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:53,537
you!

30
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,705
Train!
Train! Train!

31
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:58,705
Whoa!
Train! Train! Train! Train!

32
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:01,973
I love you, the train!
You're almost as legendary as

33
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:05,207
the farm, the train!
The train is gonna smack you

34
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,874
down on his tracks!
Whoo!

35
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:13,708
Your caboose is mine!
Choo-choo!

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,043
Choo-choo!
- Oh, my glob.

37
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:21,709
Choo!
Ow!

38
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:25,144
My legs are backwards!

39
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:27,544
Why?
Ohh! You're mean!

40
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:30,212
Did you just die?

41
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:33,712
No.
The train will chug on.

42
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:37,612
My friend makes bionic legs.
I'll be better than before.

43
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:40,047
I want bionic legs!

44
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:42,546
Who's your friend?
Yeah, right.

45
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:44,747
It's secret!

46
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:49,081
Don't follow me!

47
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,415
- Train can do this.
- You don't want bionic

48
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,647
legs.
It ain't natchy.

49
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:54,715
I don't care about
natchy.

50
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:57,549
Let's discuss this
later.

51
00:02:57,551 --> 00:03:02,483
You guys want to fight me?

52
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:04,483
You think we can
beat him?

53
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,051
Yeah way, we can't.
He's the ultimate!

54
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,818
But if we beat him,
we'll be crazy legends.

55
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,985
<i>Man, I already am a
legend in other aspects of life.</i>

56
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:15,485
Third highest score in
"kompy's kastle," brah.

57
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:19,553
<i>- Third. In the candy kingdom.
- Jake, that's your</i>

58
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:22,221
<i>legend.
This could be our legend!</i>

59
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:24,821
- Brogend!
- Okay, how are we gonna

60
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:26,921
- beat him, then?
- Train!

61
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:29,822
- He can't even walk.
- No, man.

62
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:33,889
"Train up," like "get ripped!"
Yeah, I was just

63
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:35,423
kidding.
Let's destroy that guy!

64
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,790
We're coming back for
you, the farm!

65
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,890
After we train!

66
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:42,557
- Yeah, that's cool.
- We're gonna annihilate

67
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,058
you, the farm!
Mm-kay.

68
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,291
I'm gonna do a
finishing move on you!!

69
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:52,292
All right! Yeah!

70
00:03:52,294 --> 00:03:54,726
- Come on, Jake!
- Ugh.

71
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,828
- Huh! Hyah!
- Let's see your chokey

72
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,662
brokey style.

73
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:17,396
- Nice one.
- Yes.

74
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:21,797
Now watch my...
Something style.

75
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,631
- Hyah!

76
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,799
- Huh?

77
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,799
Jake?

78
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:34,733
- You're playing "kompy's kastle"?
- Huh?

79
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:37,067
Whoo!
Uh...Yes.

80
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,168
Winning this battle
could take our reputation to a

81
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,301
- whole new level!
- Look, I'm a full-grown

82
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:47,069
dog of my own, and I need to
play "kompy's kastle" every day

83
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:50,903
- so I can maintain my rank.
- So...You don't care

84
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:53,502
- about fighting the farm?
- I never really take

85
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:57,837
anything seriously.
Except "kompy's kastle."

86
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,072
Hy-ah!
Komp-y-y-y!!

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm gonna break every bone in
your body, then heal you later

88
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:16,673
with that magical goo we got
from the cyclops's eye.

89
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,507
Aah!

90
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:21,107
- Ouch.
- Apologize!

91
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:23,842
Never!

92
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:27,475
I'm gonna turn up the

93
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:30,409
- juice!
- And I'm gonna drink it!

94
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:35,077
My little face!

95
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,411
Ow!

96
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:42,411
Where are you? Huh?

97
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:43,945
- Huh?

98
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:46,112
- Huh?
- Apologize for not

99
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:51,614
taking training seriously!

100
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:54,247
Come out, you chicken
nug!

101
00:05:54,249 --> 00:06:00,615
Ow.

102
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:20,418
Apologize to

103
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,019
- "kompy's kastle"!
- No.

104
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:28,920
You apologize for not taking
training...Seriously.

105
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:37,587
Ugh, gross!

106
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:55,658
Ow!

107
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,692
Aah! My eyes!
Cheap move, you butt rag!

108
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:06,026
You...
You're the cheap move!

109
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:09,661
Huh?
Pants!

110
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,261
I'm really gonna wipe you now.

111
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:15,128
- Bring it on, bro!

112
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:20,962
Ou-u-ch!
Ow! Ow!!

113
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:24,796
No biteys!

114
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:28,297
I'm gonna down the farm

115
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:30,998
- without you!
- I'm gonna knock down

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,864
the farm just so you'll never
know the taste of downing the

117
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:37,798
farm!

118
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,132
Yo, guess
what?

119
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:43,033
Guess what, homey?
I put in the time.

120
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:48,200
I'm-a make you mine.

121
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:53,269
Yeah, that's right.
Come and get this.

122
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,469
So, what -- both at the same
time?

123
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,469
I'm cool.
You're gonna fight this, the

124
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:01,603
farm?
Okay.

125
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:04,770
Just me.
I don't need this clown town.

126
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:08,104
The only way you're
gonna win is if you use your

127
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:11,437
- cheap moves.

128
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,538
Hey, come on.

129
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,538
You got to fight the dude.

130
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,273
I can't see!

131
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:21,940
- Walk me to the light!
- Yeah, that's what you

132
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:25,307
get.

133
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:37,376
Cloud looks like a car.

134
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:41,710
Awaken to your dream, finn

135
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:43,510
- and Jake.
- Whoa!

136
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:45,644
Who are you?
I am the dream warrior.

137
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:48,777
I've summoned you here to hang
with me in your together dream.

138
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,646
Are you gonna show us a
move to beat the farm?

139
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:53,945
First, listen.
Then wake up.

140
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,512
All right.
I have cheap cars.

141
00:08:56,514 --> 00:09:01,313
- My cars are che-e-e-ap.
- My cars are cheap.

142
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:04,780
But they drive bad when I
turn out the lights!

143
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:08,981
Turn out the lights.
These sweatpants have another

144
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,115
- name.
- Another name.

145
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,316
Yeah, don't you always
call sweatpants "give up on

146
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:16,449
- life" pants, Jake?
- I do, because peeps

147
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:19,617
need to respect themselves when
they leave the house, even if

148
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:22,350
it's just for ice cream or t.P.
Or whatevs.

149
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:26,285
Two shiny golden apples, ripe
enough to bite!

150
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:28,218
Bite!

151
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,219
That's all I got to say for now.
Get lost!

152
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,718
What is going on here,
dream warrior?

153
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,953
Yeah, what's this all
about?

154
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:38,120
Nap's over! Sorry!

155
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:41,787
Whoa.
That was a good nap.

156
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,221
Hey, did you dream
about dream warrior?

157
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:46,621
Yeah.
What was he trying to tell us

158
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:48,454
- exactly?
- I don't know.

159
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:50,555
I didn't get it.
But listen, man.

160
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:54,023
I'm sorry I got mad at you.
Who cares about my high score in

161
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:55,956
"kompy"?
It ain't important.

162
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,124
<i>No, man.
It is important.</i>

163
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:01,291
Being the third best at
something is math and deserves

164
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,492
respect, not like I did to
"kompy."

165
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:06,958
Anyway, I think we both got
cranky after all that training.

166
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,525
Well, good thing we're
rested, 'cause now we can beat

167
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,293
- this beast.
- Yeah!

168
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:14,027
Oh, hey! Look!

169
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,326
The dudes came back to
watch us fight!

170
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:19,061
A'ight. This is it.
Let's use what we learned in

171
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:21,028
- training.
- Uh...

172
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,461
All we did was fight dirty with
cheap -- wait.

173
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:27,128
My cars are che-e-ap.
