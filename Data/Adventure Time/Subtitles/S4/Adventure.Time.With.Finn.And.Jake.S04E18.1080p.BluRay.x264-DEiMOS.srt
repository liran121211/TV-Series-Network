1
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:34,352
My King.

2
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,796
My King?

3
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:38,025
Wake up, husband.

4
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:41,326
What?

5
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:44,462
Long live the King!

6
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:46,631
What is going on?

7
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:50,037
Mm. Not much.

8
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:52,373
Long live the King!

9
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:53,741
Huh?!

10
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:57,076
Wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah...

11
00:00:57,147 --> 00:00:58,614
Hey. Do I know you?

12
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,411
...wuah-wuah-wuah --

13
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,417
Hey.
I-I know that guy.

14
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:08,217
He doesn't know
he's dreaming.

15
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:10,484
Huh?

16
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:13,685
Huh?!

17
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:15,728
Come on, honey.

18
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:17,159
Eat your soup.

19
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:18,287
Huh?

20
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:19,729
Wait. Wait, wait.

21
00:01:19,797 --> 00:01:21,196
Eat it now!

22
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,801
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm!

23
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:26,767
What kind of --

24
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,236
Aah!

25
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:30,636
How...did we get here?

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,133
Uh...

27
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,006
I'm good on the soup.

28
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,509
Huh?

29
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:39,102
You!

30
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:40,805
You haven't much time, sir.

31
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,108
What?!

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,980
You are trapped in a dream,
and you are in danger.

33
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,486
You need to find this
worm and break it.

34
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:53,783
Find the worm?

35
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:55,551
But...you've got
him right there.

36
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,726
Satori!

37
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:00,852
Huh? Huh?

38
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:01,826
Huh?

39
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:06,324
Come on.

40
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,627
Jake?

41
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:08,632
Ohh!

42
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:13,095
Pfllllll!

43
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,831
Pfllllll!

44
00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:17,897
Hold down the tape
until it fully sticks to the paper.

45
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:18,906
Like this?

46
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:21,671
Yes. But now try
holding it higher.

47
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:22,710
Like this?

48
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:24,040
You need more tape.

49
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,579
Use this.

50
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,343
Now tape the bottom.

51
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,679
Who's it for?

52
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:36,118
Who's it for?

53
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:38,712
It's for, um...

54
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:39,950
Pfllllll!

55
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:41,514
It's for me!

56
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,614
Play this.

57
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:45,287
Um...okay.

58
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:52,825
The worm!

59
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,765
The worm!

60
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:03,841
Wo-o-o-o-rm!

61
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:04,807
Worm!

62
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,035
Woiiiim!

63
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:07,338
Worm!

64
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,275
Finn!

65
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:09,902
Aw, man!
Is it really you?

66
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:11,844
Jake?

67
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:13,643
Yeah.
I think so.

68
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:16,780
Yup.

69
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,217
I'm trapped in this dream,
and I can't wake up.

70
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,379
Me too.

71
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:21,978
I was just in some other
part of the dream with

72
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:23,989
Princess Bubblegum and
Flame Princess.

73
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:25,455
Make-out dreams?

74
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:26,821
Nice!

75
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:28,291
What?!

76
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,722
No, it wasn't like that.

77
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,524
Hey, I won't judge.

78
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:36,497
Uueeeggghhhhh!

79
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:38,090
Lady's got two mouths.

80
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,031
Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,501
I don't think she's real.

82
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,764
Weird.

83
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:48,497
Ouch!
What was that for?!

84
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,805
<i>Just wanted to make
sure you were real.</i>

85
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:52,673
Our dreams must be linked,
for some reason.

86
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,542
Whoa!

87
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:58,241
Well, Pep But told me we got
to find that worm that crawled

88
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:00,180
through that hole
and break it.

89
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,310
In my dream --

90
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:04,215
<i>In my dream, suddenly,</i>

91
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,482
an unimaginably amazing sword
appeared in front of me,

92
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:09,921
able to blast
the hole open.

93
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:13,153
Rad!

94
00:04:14,227 --> 00:04:15,785
I usually dream of
messed-up stuff,

95
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:17,454
like a shark trying
to bite off my face.

96
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,489
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

97
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:22,588
Oh! Oh!

98
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:24,065
Careful!

99
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:26,898
If you grunk up the dreamscape
with your subconscious fears,

100
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:28,597
the whole thing
will blow apart.

101
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,933
Ohhhh.

102
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:32,337
Just shrink down,
like me.

103
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,433
And then, I shrunk down,
like Jake.

104
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,577
How come you know so much
about dreams and stuff?

105
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:44,206
'Cause I sleep a lot.

106
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:46,147
Oh, yeah.

107
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:54,214
Fionna! Cake!

108
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:55,484
I need your help!

109
00:04:55,557 --> 00:04:56,388
What?!

110
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,481
What did you say?

111
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,117
I really did
it this time.

112
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:01,889
They're loose,
and they're coming for us!

113
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,020
Who?

114
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,499
Aaaah!

115
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:11,501
Aah!

116
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:18,229
Dad?

117
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:22,268
Help us!

118
00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:26,477
Maybe he's not really...
real.

119
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:28,674
Dad? Are you okay?

120
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,058
That scarf
looks familiar.

121
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:47,686
Yeah.

122
00:05:57,503 --> 00:05:59,403
Man!
The worm is fast!

123
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,372
Yeah, it's nuts --
fast as nuts.

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,067
Well, let's catch
it with...

125
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:06,406
Some big ol' legs!

126
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:09,570
Well, that's kind of boring
for me 'cause that's my

127
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:11,374
normal power, you know?

128
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:12,539
Then you get...

129
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:13,604
birds!

130
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:23,254
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!

131
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:24,915
Remember --
this is just a dream.

132
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,753
Keep climbing.

133
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,160
Now what?

134
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,129
Break it.

135
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,199
Pshhh!

136
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,205
Gah!

137
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,039
Gah!

138
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,535
Jake!
Are you okay?

139
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:57,309
<i>Yeah.
Are you?</i>

140
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,679
Yeah.
I'm okay.

141
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:00,717
We did it!

142
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:02,512
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

143
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:04,109
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

144
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:06,680
Hmm.

145
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,689
Was that -- was that
mirror always like that?

146
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,921
I'm pretty sure
this is not normal.

147
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:21,363
Nah. It's fine.

148
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:22,694
Aah!

149
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:28,435
Jake?

150
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:29,630
I think we're
still dreaming.

151
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,935
Nah, it's just dream residue.

152
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:34,271
Forget about it.

153
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:37,071
You sure know a
lot about dream stuff.

154
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:39,374
Hmm.

155
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:42,744
<i>You pinched me earlier,
but I never pinched you.</i>

156
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:48,148
Everything's normal.

157
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:52,486
Everything's normal.

158
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,521
It's still a dream.

159
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,318
Hmm.

160
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:00,292
Huh?!

161
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:05,323
Hey, guys.

162
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:06,798
Hey, guys.

163
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:10,061
Hyah!

164
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,227
Ha ha.

165
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:14,704
Why are you janking
up my dreamscape?!

166
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:17,468
Listen,
don't worry about it.

167
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,530
What?!

168
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:19,973
You can't defeat me.

169
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,670
<i>I'm the King Worm.</i>

170
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:25,372
I'm going to keep you in this
dreamscape until I've consumed

171
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:29,007
all your life energy.

172
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:30,606
My life energy?!

173
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:31,878
I use that!

174
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:35,182
Huuaahhh...

175
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,381
Wait.
Something's wrong.

176
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:38,615
I'm missing something.

177
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:39,884
Wait. Something's wrong.

178
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:40,947
I'm missing something.

179
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:42,013
- Worm!
...something's wrong.

180
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:43,081
I'm missing something.
- Worm!

181
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,650
Oh, man.
- Worm!

182
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:47,093
I'm gonna be stuck here --
forever.

183
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,222
Ouch!
Hey, guys.

184
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,128
Hey, guys.

185
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,029
Knock it off.

186
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:52,930
Huh?

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,797
Psst!

188
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,631
If you grunk up the dreamscape
with your subconscious fears,

189
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,729
the whole thing
will blow apart.

190
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,636
Hmm?

191
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,071
Oh, yeah.

192
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,198
Thanks, dream Jake!

193
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:11,141
Get ready to eat it!

194
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:17,475
Wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah
wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah...

195
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:18,519
Okay, Finn.

196
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:20,247
Concentrate.

197
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,914
Deepest gut fears!

198
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,395
Oh, gross!

199
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,624
The ocean.

200
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:41,532
Aah!

201
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:42,433
Yah!

202
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:43,334
Aaah!

203
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:44,234
Yaah!

204
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:46,500
Yaaaaaaaaaaah!

205
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:50,802
Okay.
Okay, that wasn't so bad.

206
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:52,434
Aah!

207
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,944
Oh, grob!
The Lich! Aah!

208
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:58,938
Hey, why don't you sit down or
pass out or something?

209
00:09:59,016 --> 00:09:59,914
Never!

210
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:06,512
Bubblegum!

211
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:08,283
Waa-hooo!

212
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:10,483
Finn! Shush!

213
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:12,787
I'm having coffee
with the Lich.

214
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,418
You wouldn't understand.

215
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:17,224
You're too young!

216
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:18,592
Bleahh!

217
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:20,824
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

218
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:25,024
Aah!

219
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:26,864
So much screaming!

220
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,905
Yaah! Aaah! Aaaah!

221
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:40,677
Had...enough...
destabilization?

222
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:44,273
I don't know what
you're talking about.

223
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:48,646
I'm a clown-ning-ning-ning.

224
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:49,549
Eep!

225
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:51,588
Well, that's that.

226
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:54,248
Wuah-wuah-wuah-wuah...

227
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,418
I don't feel so good.

228
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:00,154
Get out of our house, King Worm!

229
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,657
Is it really
you this time?

230
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,562
Yeah, mans --
actual Jake.

231
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:07,691
Cool...

232
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:08,665
Pinch.

233
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:09,666
Ow! Man, come on!

234
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,669
I'm just checking.

235
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:12,760
Just checking.
