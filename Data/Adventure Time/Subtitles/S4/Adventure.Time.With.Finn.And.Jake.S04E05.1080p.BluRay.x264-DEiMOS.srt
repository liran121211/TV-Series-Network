1
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:37,408
Oh
What?

2
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:38,951
Where are we?

3
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:40,199
I don't know.

4
00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:42,280
What did we do last night?

5
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:45,162
Mayhaps we drank juice
of the elder toad.

6
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,493
Nah, I doubt it.

7
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:48,249
Yo, do you see this?

8
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:49,500
We're in a cage.

9
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,331
DO you think we,
like, did something wrong?

10
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:52,586
Yeah, right.

11
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:54,417
When did we ever
did wrong actions?

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,843
Get real.

13
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:57,215
Who you calling?

14
00:00:57,295 --> 00:00:58,797
I'm calling Beemo --
see if he knows what happened.

15
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:02,096
You know, with us being here and junk.

16
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:03,301
My new camera phone.

17
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:04,510
Wait. Come here.

18
00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:05,766
What?

19
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:08,189
I guess I vid-taped a
buttload of stuff on here.

20
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:10,437
Play it for the
clues within.

21
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:11,813
Okay , play.

22
00:01:13,227 --> 00:01:14,069
<i>Did you take it yet?</i>

23
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:15,522
<i>Recording.</i>

24
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:17,607
<i>Okay, get a shot of the portal.</i>

25
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,613
<i>Gonna go through this biz.</i>

26
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:21,444
<i>All right, let's do --</i>

27
00:01:22,403 --> 00:01:23,245
Oh, no! What?!

28
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:25,073
Battery crunked out.

29
00:01:25,156 --> 00:01:27,625
Dude, do you remember
any of that mess?

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,667
No.

31
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:30,211
But I guess we're
here on purpose?

32
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:34,462
So, we opened a portal
to somewhere, but where?

33
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,666
The Nightosphere.

34
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,630
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah...

35
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:41,214
You're in the Nightosphere.

36
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:42,219
Are you sure?

37
00:01:42,298 --> 00:01:43,595
Uh, yes.

38
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,473
You got thrown in jail.

39
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:46,393
Look.

40
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:53,771
Look!

41
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:56,271
Marceline's dad!

42
00:01:56,354 --> 00:01:58,231
We really are
in the Nightosphere!

43
00:01:58,314 --> 00:01:59,941
Up and at 'em, people.

44
00:02:00,024 --> 00:02:01,401
Everyone out of your cages.

45
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:05,617
My shift is over,
and no one's shown up, so...

46
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:07,290
Whoa, wait.

47
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:08,366
You're letting us go?

48
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,453
I mean... yeah,
but not really.

49
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:13,379
You're in the Nightosphere,
so...

50
00:02:13,454 --> 00:02:15,548
So... what?

51
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:17,125
Is there an outlet
somewhere for this?

52
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:21,420
Hey, come on!

53
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:23,256
Just tell us how we
can get back to our world.

54
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:25,467
You can't leave
the Nightosphere --

55
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,268
<i>not unless he lets you.</i>

56
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:28,890
Marceline's dad.

57
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,519
Yeah, that's Hunson Abadeer.
He runs this place.

58
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:34,813
Hunson Abadeer?

59
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:36,485
All right.

60
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:38,279
Well, dude,
how do we talk to him?

61
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:39,526
You can't just
talk to the boss.

62
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:41,232
You got to make
an appointment.

63
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:43,283
Yeah, but we don't
even know why we're here.

64
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,952
And what's up with this?

65
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:47,655
Ugh. Ah. Oh, Oh, sick!

66
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,537
You touch that stuff'?

67
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:51,583
Later, fools.

68
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:57,165
Hey! Hey, is there an
outlet anywhere?

69
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:58,750
You guys!

70
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,086
Maybe this is where they
put all the dummy demons.

71
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:02,716
Right, big guy?

72
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:04,468
You're not so smart, right?

73
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:05,764
Yea-a-a-h.

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,966
Let's go out that hole, man.

75
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,268
Okay, get on.

76
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,921
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,876
Pretty neat.

78
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,961
Whoa! Look!

79
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:48,429
Charlic, don't socialize
with the smaller demons!

80
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:49,725
They're dirty and stupid!

81
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:51,018
Whoa!

82
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:52,140
Daddy!

83
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:57,275
What is that?

84
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,398
I think it's, like,
sentient blood mist.

85
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:00,478
Cool.

86
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:01,778
Come on.

87
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:03,902
Let's see if anyone knows
where Hunson Abadeer is.

88
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:05,198
All right.

89
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:06,150
Well, how about that dude?

90
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:07,030
Okay.

91
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:11,536
Yo, bros! How do we talk
to Hunson Abadeer?

92
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:14,288
The teller can help you.

93
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:18,964
Get in my flipping belly,
and I will transport you.

94
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:21,791
My insides are habitable.

95
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:24,627
You will not be digested.

96
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:33,848
Bye, mister!

97
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:35,521
Who's the teller?

98
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:36,768
That guy?

99
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:38,020
Okay, bozos, make room.

100
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,897
Make room. Make room.

101
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:41,228
Ouch! Come on!

102
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,778
Scooch over, fatty.

103
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:44,197
I can't, dude.

104
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:46,366
This outbox is packed tighter
than my tummy tunnel when

105
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,785
I can't make brown on the camping
trips because of my anxieties.

106
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:51,329
And I have I.B.S., also.

107
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:52,496
Ow!

108
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,574
Hey, guy!
Are you the teller?

109
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:57,456
<i>No. No, no, this is the
line to meet the teller.</i>

110
00:04:57,535 --> 00:04:59,208
No, man!
Are you for real?

111
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,413
How long's the wait?

112
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:01,839
I don't know.

113
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:04,588
I just like to row around
on top of their heads.

114
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:05,668
Bunk that!

115
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,877
Hey, do you know about this?

116
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,963
I, uh -- ohh. No.

117
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:11,219
Sick.

118
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:12,972
Why do we need to
see the teller anyway?

119
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,552
We just want to
see Hunson Abadeer

120
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:15,978
and find out what
happened to us.

121
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:18,772
The teller will get you
in touch with Hunson Abadeer.

122
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:20,691
We got systems down here.

123
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:23,189
You got to swim the proper
channels, you know?

124
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:24,566
Youse ain't special!

125
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:26,318
Youse got to wait
like the rest of youse!

126
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:27,649
Us.

127
00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:29,900
Where's the line start?

128
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:31,827
Oh I don't know.

129
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:34,122
The thing sort
of governs itself.

130
00:05:38,326 --> 00:05:39,999
Tight!

131
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:41,169
Ow!

132
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:43,588
That guy stinks.

133
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,339
Excuse me! Excuse me!

134
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:48,465
Big man? Over here!

135
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:50,592
Huh? What, me?

136
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:53,015
Uh, yeah. How long have
you been in line for?

137
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,467
How...long?

138
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:00,181
Oh, butt traps.

139
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:02,187
Jake, stretch us to the front.

140
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,859
No cutting!

141
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:07,360
I will kill you with
all my hopes and regrets!

142
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:08,530
All right, dudes, chill!

143
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:09,732
We'll wait.

144
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:19,709
I can't feel my legs.

145
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:29,548
Say something!

146
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:30,844
Say something to me!

147
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,513
I... can't.

148
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:35,512
I got nothing to say anymore.

149
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:37,218
Just make up words, then!

150
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:39,929
Bloo-be-de bloo bloo
bloo-blee-blee blah!

151
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,605
Shree shrah ha--

152
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,352
Hey, check it out.

153
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:47,482
We're at the front
of the line.

154
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:48,653
Whoo-hoo!

155
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:49,571
Yo, yo!

156
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:50,739
We want to talk
to Abadeer!

157
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:52,192
What? Oh.

158
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:53,526
When your thingy comes up,

159
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:55,452
Hunson Abadeer will
see you through the door.

160
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:57,201
42 million?!

161
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,872
What's the number on the door?

162
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:02,623
41 million...zabba, dabba...

163
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:04,249
We're next! Whew!

164
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:06,080
Man, I thought I
was gonna throw up.

165
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:08,336
That's us!

166
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,633
Yay!

167
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,882
Noooooooooo!

168
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,302
I'm gonna lose it!

169
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,431
Hey, do you know if
there's an outlet anywhere?

170
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:24,811
No.

171
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,563
Do you know what
this is all about?

172
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:27,564
No.

173
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:30,438
Gross.

174
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:33,110
What's going on, buddy?

175
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,032
You giving up?

176
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,702
I guess.

177
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:38,575
You don't want to just
stick it out a little more'?

178
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:41,248
I don't know if my little-boy
heart can take it.

179
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:42,370
Listen, Finn.

180
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,372
Are you listening?

181
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:44,828
Mm-hmm.

182
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,756
Your heart may be small, but
it's strong as a bull donk!

183
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:52,461
And I know you can wait through
this line so we can meet

184
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:55,137
Hunson Abadeer and
find out why we're here

185
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:57,931
and why we're in
a pile of Banyanles.

186
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,350
'Cause you're a champ!

187
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:01,177
Okay?!

188
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,307
Okay.

189
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:04,855
Jozu des gamate ne.

190
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,854
Well, at least I can see
the end of the line ...l think.

191
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,935
Let's wait the heck
out of this line!

192
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:11,271
That's it, champ!

193
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:14,607
Pretty pumped up.

194
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,067
<i>I'm super pumped!</i>

195
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:23,575
Does anyone need
to go pee-pees?!

196
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:27,036
Go ahead.

197
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:29,292
Okay.

198
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:33,171
Who's here with a
question for Mr. Abadeer?

199
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,422
Oh, yeah.

200
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:36,300
We've got questions.

201
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:42,885
Put your hand down, Finn!

202
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:44,311
No way, dude!
I've got questions!

203
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:49,771
What the hey, Jake?!

204
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,272
It's not answering questions,
man.

205
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:53,025
That thing's gonna
bake our beans!

206
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:56,319
Hey, blood-mist cloud!

207
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:57,615
What happened to us?!

208
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:59,068
Why can't we remember anyth--

209
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:01,654
Oh. It's gone.

210
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:02,579
Look.

211
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:07,121
Ride me, partner.

212
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,043
Hup!

213
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:13,541
Hey, cloud!

214
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:14,921
Where's Abadeer?!

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,628
Whoa.
Look at all these paintings.

216
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:20,305
I think this is
Hunson Abadeer's house.

217
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:24,101
Hey!

218
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:25,393
Hunson Abadeer!

219
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:28,439
How dare you chumps
trespass here?

220
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,391
We just want to
go home, man.

221
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:32,226
Yeah. Why'd you lock us up,
Abadeer?

222
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,107
When Marceline finds
out about this,

223
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:36,405
it's gonna stir up some heavy
daddy-daughter issues!

224
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,905
No one leaves
the Nightosphere!

225
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:41,327
Aw, come on, man!

226
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:43,529
No one!

227
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:45,865
No one leaves
the Nightosphere!

228
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:57,051
Come with me, you juicy,
little, mortal soul.

229
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:03,511
Finn!

230
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:11,599
Oh, my log, Jake.

231
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:12,649
You found the portal!

232
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:13,521
Huh?

233
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,274
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

234
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:22,409
Huh?!

235
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:23,701
We don't want to hurt you,
Abadeer.

236
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:25,279
Just let us go!

237
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:31,452
Ugh!

238
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,007
- Hyah!
- Ow!

239
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,217
Rrragh!

240
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,302
What the--?

241
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,218
Marceline?!

242
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,848
I'm gonna close
this portal!

243
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:52,599
You're forbidden to come
back to the Nightosphere!

244
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:53,682
But, Marcy!

245
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:54,767
Let us help you!

246
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,227
It's too late!

247
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,937
Stay away from me!

248
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,899
Foreve-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-r!

249
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:03,701
Marceline's in trouble.

250
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:05,403
We got to go back and save her!

251
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:08,581
All right, but I'm
gonna take a shower first.
