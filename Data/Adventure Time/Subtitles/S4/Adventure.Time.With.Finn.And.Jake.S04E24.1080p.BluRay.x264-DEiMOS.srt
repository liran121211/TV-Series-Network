1
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,133
Reign of Gunthers

2
00:00:32,437 --> 00:00:36,470
Where the turd is my
demonic wishing eye?

3
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,344
I've looked everywhere.

4
00:00:41,183 --> 00:00:42,405
What is it girl?

5
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:46,723
Do you know where it is?
Lead the way!

6
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:48,586
Oh, boy. This is just wonderful.

7
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:55,160
You just want me to brush you.

8
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:58,510
You know this brush is
for princesses only?

9
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:07,153
Ah! Princesses only.
No Gunthers.

10
00:01:08,054 --> 00:01:09,709
What are my options here?

11
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:14,523
Gunther! What is your damage today?

12
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:16,651
Wizard market!

13
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,593
W, I, Z...

14
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:30,809
Hey!

15
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:36,627
You're really peebing me off, Gunther.
Go stand in the corner.

16
00:01:40,363 --> 00:01:43,095
I said stand in the corner.

17
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,989
You make me sick.

18
00:01:49,295 --> 00:01:52,302
Try not to break anything
while I'm gone.

19
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:31,980
Gunther?

20
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,210
Jake, we gots penguins.

21
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:44,271
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

22
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:46,268
Come on, you guys. Get off me now.

23
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,747
Jake?

24
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,534
Now, shoo, you little creeps.

25
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,257
This is unusual.

26
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,826
Glob drag all.

27
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,881
What's with these super penguins?

28
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,755
I don't know, I'm guessing
it's the Ice king.

29
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:22,734
- Well where is he then?
- Ice king!

30
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,142
Wizards rule.

31
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:35,764
Uh, let's see.

32
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:38,965
That's the symbol for
magic items, right?

33
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,626
Hey, this is the magic
items shop, right?

34
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:44,687
What does it look like, you dunk?

35
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:46,422
I know that, I know.

36
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:48,520
Why can't they write it
on the sign, though?

37
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,347
Why is it all gotta be secret?

38
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:52,350
Let's just put it all out there, uh?

39
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:55,250
Equal distribution of
magic to the people.

40
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:59,214
No more symbols.
No more initiations.

41
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:00,821
You feelin' me huntress wizard?

42
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:04,070
You tryin' to get killed, Ice king?

43
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:08,382
I was just steppin' to you, girl,
with my intellectual wizard politics.

44
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:10,984
No, don't go.

45
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:15,702
Well, swing at every ball,
that's what Jay T. Dangzone says.

46
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:18,969
Hello.

47
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:23,941
So then he was telling me to beef
in the eye of glob and stuff.

48
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:25,458
Whoa, did you do it?

49
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:27,238
Yes, I did.

50
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,639
- Yo, I wouldn't do that.
- Get over it, man.

51
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,785
Don't you wanna reach the highest
initiation of the secret schools?

52
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,098
Of course, man.

53
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:39,486
In shadow we find the light.
Safely sealed in darkest night.

54
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:44,294
So make sure y'all keep it tight.
Wizards only, fools.

55
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:45,974
Keep what tight?

56
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:49,241
A secret you never should
have heard, Ice king.

57
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:53,174
Yo, guys, chill. I lost my
demonic wishing eye.

58
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:55,155
Just give me a new one and I'll jet.

59
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:57,234
I didn't hear nothing about no
weird secret wizard club

60
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:58,530
that I wanna be a part of.

61
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,821
Loose lips sink the ships, Ice king.

62
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:04,847
Sorry, man. Nothing personal.

63
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:05,848
Oh, sleds.

64
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:08,093
You, guys!

65
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:12,363
Okay, I give up.

66
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:14,794
Gunther?

67
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:16,019
Nice eyes.

68
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,058
What's going on here, man.
Cold your super-bros.

69
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:21,497
Well, that's great.

70
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,068
Where's the Ice king, Gunther?

71
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:24,823
Gunther?

72
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,405
What? All right.

73
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:34,138
Is this happening everywhere?

74
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,918
I don't know, let me see.

75
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:38,955
'Kay.

76
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:40,780
- What do you see?
- Hold on.

77
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:42,836
Oh, no. No!

78
00:05:42,837 --> 00:05:45,308
- What dude?
- Hold on, man. Wait.

79
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:48,176
Oh, glob, this can't be happening.

80
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:49,513
Tell me!

81
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:51,679
It's over, we've been conquered.

82
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:53,752
- Who's been conquered?
- Everyone.

83
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:57,166
- By the Ice king?
- No, dude. By Gunther.

84
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,767
Holy schnab.

85
00:05:58,802 --> 00:05:59,910
Give me that!

86
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,075
Gunther's heading for the candy kingdom.

87
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,943
We've gotta save them.

88
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:09,154
Whoa, okay.

89
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:10,828
Hurry, Jake!

90
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,714
Wait, I'm still in my p-jayjays.

91
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,028
Yo, Finn, are you seeing these penguins?

92
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:24,063
Yeah, It's Gunther. He's taking
over the whole thing.

93
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,522
Well, he'll have to beat
my banana guards

94
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:28,023
and my gumball guardians.

95
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:29,880
That's not gonna work.

96
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,113
What did he say?

97
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:34,081
- He says your plan is bunk.
- Well, what's your plan?

98
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:36,230
- I got a plan.
- You do?

99
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,902
When we get there, I'll do my plan
in adittion to your plan.

100
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:40,857
Two plans. Laters.

101
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,174
All right.

102
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,215
- So you're not gonna tell me y...?
- I'm outies.

103
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:46,456
You're not gonna tell her the plan?

104
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:48,443
No, I've gotta be mysterious.

105
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:51,477
What? I thought you weren't
into Bubblegum anymore.

106
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,468
I'm not, but this is how I act now
with all the ladies, you see?

107
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:56,333
I keep them in a state of confusion.

108
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:59,601
That way, I've always got options
in case Flame princess doesn't work out.

109
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:01,386
Oh my gosh!

110
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,239
Where is that coming from?

111
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,802
It's called "future farming".

112
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:07,207
I read it in that book you have
by Jay T. Dangzone.

113
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:11,092
Jay T. Da...! Oh, dude!
Don't read that book!

114
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,537
It's gonna mess up your brain.

115
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,111
I keep that book around for laughs.
It's all really bad advice.

116
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:20,785
Oh, okay, I'll stop it then.

117
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:24,518
No, well. You can still be
mysterious, that's fine.

118
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,455
What? Now I'm confused.

119
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:28,767
Nevermind, I didn't say nothing.

120
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:30,950
Hey, P-Bubs, are you ready?

121
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,286
Yes. The cavalry is standing by.

122
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,440
Cool, I'm gonna rally some citizens
and do this other plan.

123
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:38,240
- Okay but what...?
- Good luck!

124
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:40,193
Jake, what's with all the mystery.

125
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:43,979
Oh, snap! Look out!

126
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:46,831
Banana guards, defend!

127
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:53,912
Oh, geez.

128
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:55,989
Evil presence detected.

129
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,961
Must defend...

130
00:07:57,962 --> 00:07:59,725
candy kingd...

131
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:07,542
You'll never get past
these walls, I think.

132
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,851
This is my plan.

133
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:24,502
I got the candy kingdom
underground to help me collect

134
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,135
all the bottles in the land.

135
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:35,128
Breaking news, that mystery plan
of yours is a smash hit.

136
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:39,057
Because, uh... of the glass.

137
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:42,813
I guess all they care about is bottles.

138
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,566
So, what will happen when
they run out of bottles?

139
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,620
I won't let that happen, probs.

140
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:03,787
Stay back!

141
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,406
Wait a minute!

142
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:13,529
Put away your weapons and
we'll get you more bottles.

143
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,812
Peeb, there aren't any bottles left.

144
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,575
I have a third plan.

145
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,562
So, we make them new bottles,

146
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,471
then the Gunthers break the bottles,

147
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:30,267
then we pick up the glass and
make new bottles again?

148
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:31,072
Yup.

149
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:33,005
What, like forever?

150
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,209
Yes.

151
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,855
Bub, your plan bunks.

152
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,622
Yeah.

153
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,842
I like it. I got a rythm going.

154
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,551
What, what do you want? I don't...

155
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:55,831
He wants to smash the
Gumball guardian's head.

156
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:58,771
We're going to make more
bottles, just wait, okay?

157
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:02,484
No!

158
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:03,485
Goodbye, princess.

159
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:09,896
Hey, what's going on here?

160
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:11,496
Why is this place all crazy?

161
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:13,465
I was just flying by and...

162
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:16,432
Gunther! You took my stuff!

163
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:20,174
That's bad! You know what you get now?

164
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:23,886
That's right. You get
the squirty squirts.

165
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:25,674
Bad, bad.

166
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:28,587
Now take off my demonic wishing eye.

167
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:35,394
All right, Gunther. Now go home.

168
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:38,036
That's right, walk.

169
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,729
While you're walking home
you think about what you did.

170
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:45,227
It's getting worse and worse
with him, he just...

171
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,553
he hates it when I leave the castle.

172
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:48,835
I'm sorry guys.

173
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:51,271
Uh, dude, where have you been?

174
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:53,801
Yeah, and why are you all jacked up?

175
00:10:54,729 --> 00:10:58,742
Well, I got into some crazy
wiz biz over a wizard city.

176
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,539
Honestly, I don't even
know how I survived.

177
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,196
Basically, it was the craziest
showdown ever, I...

178
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:08,799
I wish I could tell you
