00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:15,092
It's true.
You're stunning.

180
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:21,398
Oh, glob, no!

181
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,034
U-uh...
I mean --

182
00:07:24,036 --> 00:07:26,103
I am an excellent source

of vitamin b,
copper, and zinc!

Uh, congrats?

Yeek!

Hey, now!

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,450
That was poor sportsmans--
whoa!

00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:42,619
Mid-joke?
You monster.

189
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:46,456
If you combine me with yeast
and ferment me,

190
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:50,093
I'll form a healthy tea
called kombucha.

-Hyup!

Finn: Mushroom chop!
Whoa! Ugh!

196
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,741
The health benefits
of kombucha

197
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:07,744
have not been confirmed
by scientific research.

198
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:10,380
We're learning a lot
about mushrooms today.

199
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,985
Ugh.
They're in my sinuses.

200

Yoink.

201
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:20,824
In fact, drinking kombucha
has been linked in rare cases

202
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:22,659
to serious side effects.

203
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,094
[ Gasps ] Ugh.

204
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:26,997
[ Coughing ]
That was dumb.

[ All coughing ]

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,301
Canyon, your dowsing rod!

00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:35,238
Dude.
The sacred spring.

208
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,807
Mushrooms are gentle.

209
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,275
To clean me, wipe me
with a damp paper towel.

-Whoa!

Hyaaaahhh!

Yahhhhh!

00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:45,682
Canyon, you're so cool.

214
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:47,684
My chromophores

00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:50,087
to dye wool

00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:54,358
Farewell, mega-mush.

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,161
May we meet again
in your next incarnation.

[ Laughs ] Cute.

220
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,933
This was fun, canyon.

221
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,034
[ Laughs ] Yep.

222
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,535
I found the sacred spring,

223
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:08,205
and we exterminated
the flying mushroom infestation.

224
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:10,040
Mission complete.

225
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,942
[ Laughs ] Yeah.
Oh. Hmm.

226
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:14,444
That wasn't actually
our mission.

227
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,848
King of Ooo: All right,
boys, let's see it.

228
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,216
Fair princess of Ooo,

229
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:22,052
we were unable to procure
a flying mushroom,

230
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:25,889
so instead, may we present
an advanced mushroom pizza!

231
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:27,124
[ Gasps ]

232
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:28,859
It's not as you ordered,
my liege...

233
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:32,162
But this pizza can probably fly
if you believe hard enough.

234
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:35,565
Ooh!
A delightful pizza-ah!

235
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:38,969
Well, then,

-Whaaaaat?

You have defied the order
of your princess.

Henceforth, you are banished
from my royal guard.

239

Spare me your groveling.

You're fired.
Shoo, shoo.
