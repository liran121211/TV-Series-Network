1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,547
Hey, Cinnamon Bun.

2
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,717
Hi. I'm here
on diplomatic business.

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,720
Yeah, the princess
is expecting you.

4
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,994
Cinnamon Bun, welcome!

5
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,296
On behalf of the Fire Kingdom,

6
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:34,533
here's the get-well card
for Hot Dog Princess.

7
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:38,136
Please pass it along
to the next princess

8
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,071
after you've signed.

9
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,806
Understood.

10
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,210
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
I'm here!

11
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,344
Hey, Finn!

12
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,814
What's up,
my main cinna-man!

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,818
Please deliver this card
to the Slime Kingdom.

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,753
Will do, PB.

15
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,722
CB, keep up that smile.

16
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,659
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

17
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,094
Sit down, CB.
Let's catch up.

18
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,396
Uh...

19
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:08,900
I guess I can chat
for a few seconds.

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,171
It seems like living
in the Fire Kingdom

21
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,006
is doing you a lot of good.

22
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,841
Oh, I like it there a lot.

23
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,878
I have an important job.
I have a wolf.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,049
There's no other candy people,
so that's weird.

25
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,684
Hmm.

26
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,053
Well, it was nice catching up.

27
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,523
Okay. Bye.

28
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:34,259
Oh, CB!
You forgot your keys!

29
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,361
Hey, look who we have here!

30
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,897
Hey, guys.

31
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,033
Chet, you still make
those awesome nachos?

32
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,468
You know it.

33
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,371
Crunchy, still chewing
that same piece of gum?

34
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,139
Yep!

35
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,276
You still acting like
a big goofball all the time?

36
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,779
Ha! I was a different guy
back then.

37
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,382
Heh...
Very different.

38
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,551
Everyone watch!
I'm gonna do a flip!

39
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,386
Whoa-oh-oh!

40
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,222
Oh! Oh, no!

41
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,291
Yi-yi-yi!

42
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,894
But now life is great.

43
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,097
It can't be easy for him,

44
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,134
living alone somewhere
so different than home.

45
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:21,906
Princess?

46
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,408
Where are you?

47
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,310
Oh, hold on.
Almost done.

48
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,013
I want to show you
my newest creation.

49
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,248
I call her Bun Bun.

50
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,683
Hi! I'm Bun Bun!

51
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,351
Hey!

52
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,420
Is she like
a little Cinnamon Bun clone?

53
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,756
I grew her
from old CB experiments,

54
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,258
so... maybe more like
a third cousin?

55
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,361
Your mission is to take Bun Bun
to the Fire Kingdom.

56
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,629
Yay!

57
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,465
I made you a new fire suit.

58
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,034
Bun Bun doesn't need one

59
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,370
since I engineered her
to be fireproof.

60
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,608
So, how does it feel
to be alive?

61
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,610
Um, it feels good, I think.

62
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,712
What's the opposite of good?

63
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,448
Bad. That's funny
that you don't know that word

64
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,850
but you know
the word "opposite."

65
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,121
What was that?
Hm. I must be hungry.

66
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,323
Hun-gry?

67
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,626
Trail mix
will fix this grumbling.

68
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,995
Here.

69
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,730
Have some.

70
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,733
Like this?

71
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,868
You're funny, Bun Bun.

72
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,637
Huh?

73
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,339
Bun Bun, chipmunks
are eating your trail mix.

74
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,042
What are chipmunks?!

75
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,712
Look!
I made friends!

76
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,648
Bun Bun, you're all right.

77
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,718
I'm all right!

78
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:43,922
Hey, Finn.

79
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,224
Make way for the princess!

80
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,660
Finn?
What brings you here?

81
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,862
Special delivery
for Cinnamon Bun.

82
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,330
Who's this?

83
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,833
I'm Bun Bun.
Are you a chipmunk?

84
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,101
No.

85
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,436
Bubblegum made her
from your spare parts.

86
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,905
She's supposed to be your squire
or whatever.

87
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,041
My... squire?

88
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,676
Hmm.

89
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,344
Bun Bun, we'll have to run you

90
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,746
through some security checks.

91
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,449
Okee!
Turn around.

92
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,284
Jump back.

93
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,420
Jump forward.

94
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,122
Reach for the sky.

95
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,289
Reach!

96
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,391
She's clean.

97
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,927
Go have fun
with your new friend, CB.

98
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,362
Come, squire!

99
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,765
I'll show you
our beautiful palace.

100
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,734
All right, then.
See ya.

101
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,704
Finn, wait. You don't have to
just run off like that.

102
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,539
We can hang out
if you've got time.

103
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,707
Really?

104
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,076
I have a light schedule today.

105
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,545
Hi! I'm Bun Bun!

106
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,213
Hiya! I'm Bun Bun!

107
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,917
This is the statue
of the third Flame king.

108
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,787
Ooh, but that statue
over there is bigger!

109
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,091
Yah! Yah! Yah!

110
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,492
Careful, Bun Bun!

111
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,760
Whoops.

112
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,897
Bun Bun!

113
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,739
Look!
I'm king of the fireplace!

114
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,843
Behave yourself, Bun Bun!

115
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,445
Okay! I'm-a run this way now!
I love you!

116
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,048
Um...
She's new.

117
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,620
Is something wrong
with your coals?

118
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,656
No, they're fine.

119
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,659
It's just...

120
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,495
When we broke up, I said sorry,

121
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,532
but I didn't fully understand
exactly what I did wrong.

122
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,800
I get it now.

123
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,836
I shouldn't
have manipulated you.

124
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,338
That was a really, really
messed-up thing to do,

125
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,607
and I'm truly sorry.

126
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,376
You've grown up a lot, man.

127
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,512
I forgive you.

128
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,348
Awesome.

129
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,453
Bun Bun.
Bun... Bun Bun.

130
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,821
Ooh, what's in there?

131
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,691
That's where we keep
the evil former king.

132
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,659
Yeah, we're not supposed
to go in.

133
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,127
Bun Bun!

134
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:08,366
Hi, fire man.
You look sad.

135
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,003
I don't get sad.
I'm evil!

136
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,372
I'm just bored
of this intense loneliness.

137
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,407
You want some mush?

138
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,642
Um...

139
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,810
Who are you?

140
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,179
Bun Bun.
Do you like dogs?

141
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,047
Sure, I like dogs.

142
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,983
Not those stupid tiny ones,
though.

143
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,484
I like them medium-sized.

144
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,254
Oh! I like dogs!
We're friends!

145
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,822
But I just met you.

146
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,192
First I'll need to know
exactly how evil you are.

147
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,393
I'm 100% evil.

148
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,661
What's evil?

149
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,163
Now, what you're doing
is really good.

150
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,166
Trying to make friends
with the old king and all.

151
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:47,071
But there's one
very, very important thing

152
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,073
that you need to promise me.

153
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,074
Yes.

154
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,343
You see that button over there?

155
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,611
Whatever you do...

156
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,513
Button!

157
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,183
Well done, Bun Bun!

158
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,353
Now to the hills
to regroup my forces!

159
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,356
Ha ha!
I'm free!

160
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,858
Oh, my Glob.

161
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,961
Free!
Free is good, right?

162
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,398
No, this is bad!
We have to catch him.

163
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,066
Catch!

164
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,106
Oh!
The Ice King!

165
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,876
Shelby.

166
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,211
Princess Bubblegum!

167
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,849
Okay.
Who am I?

168
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,420
Pbht!

169
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,722
I practiced that one.

170
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,458
So, what else you been up to?

171
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,293
I started freestyle rapping.

172
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,895
What?!

173
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,463
Everyone says I'm good,
but I can't tell

174
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,632
if they're just flattering me
'cause I'm king.

175
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,900
Right.

176
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,506
Fire man!
Fire man!

177
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,909
Shh!
This is serious!

178
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:01,913
Want to see me do a flip?

179
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,115
Wow.

180
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,184
Ohh-aaaah!

181
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:08,920
Bun Bun!

182
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,756
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

183
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,928
On to plotting
our diabolical scheme.

184
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,430
Bun Bun, I hear the Flame King!

185
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,271
So, wearing your fire costumes,
you'll pose

186
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,341
as a basket of orphans
left on the castle doorstep.

187
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,442
They'll take you in.

188
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,444
And when they bring you
to the king,

189
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,347
you bust out the water guns
and seize control!

190
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,282
Any questions?

191
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,651
Are these your kids?

192
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,953
They're my army.

193
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,122
Your plan's not gonna work.

194
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:48,126
I know.
I'm rusty at this war stuff.

195
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,194
You should do chipmunk stuff.

196
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,297
Is that what I am now?
The chipmunk king?!

197
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,166
Uh... I don't know.

198
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,969
Perhaps you're right.

199
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,238
I have no allies left
in the Fire Kingdom.

200
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,573
And even if I did manage
to steal it back,

201
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,343
I'd probably have to redecorate
the whole castle.

202
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,312
Maybe I could stay here
and rule.

203
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,647
Figurehead-style.

204
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,083
And I'll be
the royal dog petter!

205
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,152
Would you really stay here
with me

206
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,421
and my kingdom
of adorable vermin?

207
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,855
Okay.

208
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,391
You're all right, Bun Bun.

209
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,194
All hail the chipmunk king!

210
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,163
All hail the chipmunk king!

211
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,398
All hail the chipmunk king!

212
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,002
Bun Bun,
you're gonna do great here.

213
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,604
'Cause you're brilliant.

214
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,840
Thanks for helping me out.

215
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,782
Finn the human,
he wears a bear hat

216
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,118
Someday he'll be old and fat

217
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,088
Unless he is immortal
or a turtle

218
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,356
'Cause turtles always look old

219
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,458
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

220
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,360
Turtles got told by me, Phoebe

221
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,361
Pure gold

222
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,900
Guess who's back,
it's Cinnamon Bun

223
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,204
Bun Bun told me
how to have fun again

224
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,873
Also, she let out the old king

225
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,074
What?!

226
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,411
It's okay.
He's a in a chipmunk cave.

227
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,213
It's nice.

228
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,614
See?

229
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,450
Aww.
Did Bun Bun draw that?

230
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,586
No.

231
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,089
We can't just let him
run around though, right?

232
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,225
How do we know he won't moidle
all those chipmunks?

233
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,327
No, he always did like animals.

234
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,329
I wonder if a new environment

235
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:34,232
might help bring out
that softer side of him.

236
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,634
Being stuck in a lamp
sure won't do it.

237
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,203
Let's leave him be.

238
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,145
"Dear Cinnamon Bun,
I have a dog now."

239
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,413
His name is Cinnamon Bun.

240
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,415
"Love, Bun Bun."

241
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:57,655
Come along with me

242
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:02,226
And the butterflies and bees

243
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:06,564
This party is so crazy!
