Ha!

179
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,497
Get away
from my head!

180
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:26,698
Ho-ho!

181
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,201
We have
some unfinished business.

182
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:34,306
Wait for me,
little dirt beer!

183
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,077
Ooh, is somebody afraid
of old Starchy?

184
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,613
I'm afraid
of <i>killing</i> you.

185
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,548
Oh, boo-hoo.

186
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,417
Don't hurt me!

187
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,954
Ugh. Is it not possible
to get away from you?

188
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:52,023
I'm escorting you
to your new home --

189
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,092
far away
from <i>my</i> house.

190
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,061
It's not even
your house.

191
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,330
Ha!
It's practically mine.

192
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,400
Tonight,
you'll sleep in a hole --

193
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:06,071
the same dirty grave hole
from whence you sprang!

194
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:09,507
I'm not usually violent,
but you pushed me.

195
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,446
Nah.

196
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,747
What's this?

197
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,283
Okay,
now we're talking.

198
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:22,754
Poke me with a shovel now,
you mustache face.

199
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:23,955
Aw.

200
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,324
Stop it,
both of you.

201
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,294
Neither of you thought
to ask <i>me</i> what <i>i</i> want.

202
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,130
I've made a decision
who I want to be with.

203
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,132
[ Wind whistling ]

204
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,635
I don't want to be with
either of you.

205
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,903
What?!
You're a maniac.

206
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,107
I can't believe
I ever got that low.

207
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,010
Hmm!
Starchy doesn't need this.

208
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,380
And you.
I don't know you anymore.

209
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,251
Okay.
Take care of yourself.

210
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:57,989
I said "I don't know you,"
but I'd like to.

211
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,091
Would you like
to go on a date?

212
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,760
Yee!
[ Clears throat ]

213
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,695
I mean, yes.
This is weird, right?

214
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,331
Well, we've never
actually dated before.

215
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,299
We got married
so fast.

216
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,002
Let's take it slow
this time around.

217
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,038
One date
at a time.

218
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,943
 Come along with me

219
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:23,214
 and the butterflies and bees
