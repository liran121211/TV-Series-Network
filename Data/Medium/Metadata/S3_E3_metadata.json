On the first day, she dreams that she is involved in a car accident where the other party was found to have a body and guns in the trunk of his car. On the second time around, she and Detective Scanlon wait for the same car to pass by but when Scalon pull the driver over, finds that he is a federal court judge. On the third time, they go directly to the restaurant where a gunman had killed several people in a previous dream only to have Scanlon shot. The fourth time proves to work out somewhat better that she could have hoped. Allison also gets to hone her parenting skills over the 3 days when she has to deal with Ariel's reluctance to go to school because of a bully.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0908622", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 314, "number_of_episodes": 130}
