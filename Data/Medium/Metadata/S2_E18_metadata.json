The killings are random and the victims have nothing in common. They were also killed in remote locations - one was rock climbing while another had her car breakdown on the road - and there is no way the killer could have known they would be there or just have stumbled upon them by chance. When she dreams of the killer's next victim, she manages to contact the woman and warn her but when it all becomes public, her explanation leads the killer to contact her directly. Meanwhile, Bridgette is preparing a class presentation on her Mom's occupation and somehow it's all coming across as a little too much to tell.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0786605", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 265, "number_of_episodes": 130}
