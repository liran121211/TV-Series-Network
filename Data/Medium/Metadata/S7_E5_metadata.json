Her hand will grab onto people or objects, including the television remote control where is will constantly change channels. At the same time she is having dreams about a young woman, a doctor, who is assaulted and put into the trunk of a car. She eventually concludes that the skin graft she has received came from the dead woman but how to prove that her hospital colleague is responsible for the young woman's murder is the puzzle Allison has to solve.

She hasn't told her parents about her sudden success - they think she is the team's equipment manager - and for good reason since she is actually receiving ghostly coaching.\u2014garykmcd", "Allison burns her hand in the kitchen requiring a skin graft.
