She also dreams that one of Devalos' old cases comes back to haunt him when Clyde Morton, a juvenile he refused to convict as an adult, is released from prison and kills a young woman with a knife. When Allison and Det. Lee Scanlon investigate, they seem to make matters worse. Allison is also worried about the young woman she sees killed and tries to stop that. Meanwhile, Joe runs into an old flame from graduate school, much to Allison's annoyance, and the woman soon asks him out for lunch.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0645638", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 285, "number_of_episodes": 130}
