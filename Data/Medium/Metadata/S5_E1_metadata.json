Her sister Robin was bludgeoned to death six months earlier at her cottage and she is not satisfied that the previous DA had conducted a thorough investigation. Gabrielle herself suffered a great loss when two years previously her author husband was killed. She has since re-married to another writer, Joel Tiernan, and appears to be quite happy. Things get a bit complicated when Allison begins to dream that Gabrielle's first husband killed his sister-in-law, but he was dead long before Robin's murder. It all turns to the bizarre when Gabrielle insists that her first husband's spirit occupies Joel's body. At home meanwhile, Joe and Allison have to deal with Bridgette who has been drawing pictures of her art teacher.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1363403", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 233, "number_of_episodes": 130}
