Only problem is that no one else can hear it and the song is in her own mind. It's enough to drive anyone crazy but it leads her to learn about a girl who has been missing for about 24 hours and to her mp3 player, which is smashed and covered with blood. It's pretty obvious she's been forcibly taken and when Allison meets the girl's parish priest, it's equally obvious that he knows who has done it but can't reveal the information. Meanwhile, Joe's sister is about to be married and the entire Dubois family is scheduled to fly off to attend the wedding. That is until Allison dreams of a plane crash forcing them on a rather long road trip. There is a reason behind it all however.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0645636", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 337, "number_of_episodes": 130}
