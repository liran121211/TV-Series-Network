It turns out to be William Gerwin, someone Devalos unsuccessfully defended when he was accused of rape. Now out on parole, Gerwin denies having anything to do with the card but Allison's dreams reveal otherwise. They also reveal some potentially unethical conduct on Devalos' part. Bridgette meanwhile has to pay a year's worth of library fines and ends up working at the library to make up her debt. There she meets a Nigerian prince who, despite her father's advice to the contrary, she believes to be genuine.
