At the same time, Allison learns of a cancer doctor who is missing and could be dead. The clues from the waking and dream worlds converge when someone who may know more than he's telling about the doctor's disappearance turns out to look exactly like Death.\u2014Miles-10", "In her dreams, both waking and sleeping, Allison is having regular encounters with the Angel of Death who seems to be suggesting to her that her time on Earth is short. At work, she and Det. Lee Scanlon investigate the disappearance of Dr. Dean Bannister. They eventually find him dead in a seedy hotel having apparently fallen in the bathroom. Scanlon is prepared to write it off as an accident, but Allison thinks there has to be more to it. She soon encounters Bob Sherman, an insurance salesman, who just happens to be the spitting image of the Angel of Death. It turns out that Sherman was dealing in a very particular type of re-insurance and that he and Dr. Bannon may have a more than just a casual acquaintance.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0801263", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 275, "number_of_episodes": 130}
