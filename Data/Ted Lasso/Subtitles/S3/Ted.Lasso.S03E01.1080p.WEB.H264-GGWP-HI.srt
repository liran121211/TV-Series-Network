- Exactly.

00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:11,974
Oh, boy.

165
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,184
Mmm. You know, this might be a good time

166
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,771
for us to update our roster. Put
some more firepower in the team.

167
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,898
That is a great idea, Leslie.

168
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,568
Let's put some feelers
out, shall we? Ted?

169
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,361
[STAMMERS] Well, I
know Roy and Coach Beard

170
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,029
are working on some new tactics.

171
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,490
And, you know, the fellas we got
are already gelling real nice.

172
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,033
I think we're gonna do fine this season.

173
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,536
Ted, this team doing
"just fine" is a far cry

174
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,454
from you telling me we're
going to win the whole thing.

175
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,415
- Whoa!
- Whoa, did I really say that?

176
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,251
Yes, you did. Over there
after the Man City loss.

177
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,254
Just before you blasted half a
liter of Pellegrino in my face.

178
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,298
- Oh, right.
- Wait, what happened?

179
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,593
That is the Ted Lasso I want
coaching my team this season.

180
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,344
The one who's willing to fight.

181
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,804
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

182
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,889
You watch, from now on,

183
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,141
I'll be floating like a
butterfly and stinging like a bee.

184
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,185
Except I won't die immediately
after using my stinger.

185
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,562
I plan to float and sting for
the entirety of the whole season.

00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,855
[SIGHS] Excellent.

Right, if you'll excuse me,

00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,736
I have a very important lunch
meeting with one Ms. Keeley Jones...

Yo.

Okay.

00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,121
- You say "yo"?
- Yeah, I know. It just popped out...

194
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,456
Oh, no. I'm not judging. I loved it.

195
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,790
- I wanna make sure I heard right.
- Okay. Yeah.

[O'BRIEN] Yeah. Thank
you very much, Dani.

205
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,184
I had a woman accost me on the street,

206
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,977
telling me I should fake
an injury this season

207
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,522
so I wouldn't have to
deal with the misery.

Did you tell her to piss off?

This is the best way for
us to play this season.

237
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,457
The 4-4-2,
which is...

Four defenders, four in the
midfield, and two up front.

- God, I'm proud of you.

Yeah. Henry and I played a whole
bunch of FIFA while he was here.

241
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,967
Very helpful. You know, we
both learned who Maradona was,

cocaine is actually bad for you.

Please, keep going.

Right. These little pricks have
played 4-4-2 ever since they were kids,

245
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,269
which means they'll always know
what they're supposed to do,

where they're supposed to be

[CHUCKLES] Yeah. No, he
does work a lot, don't he?

- Yeah.

- Oh. Kenneth was in a cult?
- Mmm.

He was the leader of one.

Wow. Okay.

- I feel so much better. [CHUCKLES]
- [REBECCA] Mmm.

Crying is the best, isn't it?
It's like an orgasm for the soul.

- Oh.
- [CHUCKLES]

I don't think I cried
once about anything.

No, not really. [INHALES SHARPLY]

I'm a bit worried that
Ted isn't worried enough.

Yeah, but you gotta
let Ted be Ted, right?

Yes. I suppose so.

No, I'm more bothered that Rupert
must just be so happy right now.

But he's not stuck in the
same way he used to be stuck.

369
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,005
I mean, back then,

370
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:07,384
I wanted to destroy everything that
Rupert loved and owned and coveted.

371
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,219
You know, like Left Eye from TLC

372
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,180
when she burned all her
boyfriend's trainers in the bath

373
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,723
and ended up burning
down the entire house.

- Fucking legend.

But the me now doesn't feel the
need to destroy Rupert's life.

377
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,110
No, the now me just wants to beat him.

- [SIGHS] That's growth, right?
- Sure.

let Rupert be Rupert too.

So the office is
cheerful and smells nice.

Flowers are for two things, Ms.
