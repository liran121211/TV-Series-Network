1
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:26,944
Fucking hell.

2
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,155
All right, let's go.

3
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,572
It's 4:00 a.m.

4
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,700
Yeah. We start at 4:00 a.m.

5
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,910
I thought you were joking.

6
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,161
How is that a joke?

7
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,580
'Cause it's 4:00 a.m.

8
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,835
We start at 4:00, so you can do
three workouts a day instead of two.

9
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,296
Okay, but it's 4:00 a.m.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,590
Do you wanna be better than Zava or not?

11
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,719
Well, how are we gonna see? It's dark out.

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,431
Fucking hell.

13
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,560
Now get dressed.
Or I start flicking your balls.

14
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,854
This is perverse.

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,721
Whoops.

16
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,529
There you go.

17
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,669
Good morning, Sassy Smurf.

18
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,173
Good morning, Marlboro Man.

19
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,218
You know, you snored all night.

20
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,178
I'm sorry about that.

21
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,763
That's all right.
It's actually very soothing.

22
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,056
Sounded like the sea.

23
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,767
Well, I'm glad
you didn't hear any boat horns,

24
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,604
given all the fried yams I ate last night.

25
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:34,445
Hey, I was thinking.
We have a good time together, yeah?

26
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,157
They're called simultaneous orgasms,
Ted, yes.

27
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,742
Yeah, well, but I mean

28
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,246
also all the talking and laughing
and all that stuff. Yeah?

29
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,500
Sure.
Well, apart from all your dreadful puns.

30
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,751
Right. Well, it's tough.

31
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,797
Sometimes I just see 'em there,
and I gotta take a swing at 'em, you know?

32
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,634
No, I... Well, what I'm getting at is...

33
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,930
Well, I was just thinking maybe...

34
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,308
we could go on an actual date sometime.

35
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,769
You know? You and me, together.

36
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,814
God, no.

37
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,441
Well, I appreciate you taking the time
to consider it.

38
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,735
Ted, we can't date.

39
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,737
Why not?

40
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,074
- You're a mess.
- I'm a mess?

41
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,700
Course you are.

42
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,161
I'm a mess too, but I'm a mess
three years further on than you,

43
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,581
so I'm more of a slight disarray.

44
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,791
More like a slight disarray of sunshine,
if you ask me.

45
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,209
Oh, God.

46
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,838
- Sorry.
- Ted, on the day my ex got remarried,

47
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,675
I drank a bottle of red wine
through a straw

48
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,886
and told my Uber driver
I was in love with him.

49
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,681
Then, when he dropped me home,
I puked so much,

50
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,768
my mouth was like an elevator
from the goddamn Shining.

51
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,645
Knocked my rating down to a 3.9.

52
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,939
3.9?

53
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,151
Fuck you. Why? What's yours?

54
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,197
Oh, God, you're a five, aren't you?

55
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,742
- Course you're a five. How the fuck are you a five?
- Course you're a five. How the fuck are you a five?

56
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:04,702
I don't know. I'm tidy.
I say "Please" and "Thank you."

57
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,788
Sometimes I offer to drive
if they look tired.

58
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,417
You are such a mess.

59
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,380
Ted, I like our status.

60
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:22,012
Friends with benefits,
like Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher.

61
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,223
No.
I think you're thinking of 2011's other

62
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,392
good-friends-turned-casual-lovers
based rom-com.

63
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:30,937
No Strings Attached.

64
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,650
Friends with Benefits
was Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.

65
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,236
Wow. 2011, friends be fuckin'.

66
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,362
Yeah.

67
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,449
So, let's keep things 2011.
Cool and breezy.

68
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,326
Like an Arab Spring.

69
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,124
And good luck
against West Ham this weekend.

70
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,750
Fuck Rupert

71
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,046
and that shriveled raisin-pouch
he calls a nutsack.

72
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,145
Hello! Here for Flo?

73
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,940
- You can jump in, love.
- Lovely, thank you.

74
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,818
This is nice. Gray seats? Yes, please.

75
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,862
<i>West Ham. This is the real opportunity</i>

76
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,572
<i>for the Wonder Kid
to become the Wonder Man...</i>

77
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,074
101.

78
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,410
100.

79
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,996
Ninety-nine.

80
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,127
Why do you only sleep with a top on?

81
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,006
Because I get cold upstairs
and hot downstairs.

82
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,133
I get that.

83
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,721
Mornin'.

84
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,119
Listen to what Rupert said in this one.

85
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,040
"I truly look forward
to seeing my old club again.

86
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,335
Richmond are top-class."

87
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,588
- What a soggy, wet piece of shit.
- Thank you.

88
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,801
Right, I'm off to the training ground.
Thanks again for the opportunity.

89
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,845
Babe, you earned it.

90
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,057
{\an8}Shandy came up with
this super fun Bantr promo.

91
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,184
{\an8}It uses all the single players
on the team.

92
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,435
{\an8}Yeah.

93
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,524
{\an8}The anonymous man you're Bantr-ing with
could be a professional footballer.

94
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,817
{\an8}That's great.

95
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,612
{\an8}And that's all the single players,
you say?

96
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,699
{\an8}So, it's, like,
Colin and Dani and Sam, et cetera?

97
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,953
{\an8}Yeah, although I don't think
Sam's doing it anymore.

98
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,373
- No.
- So fun.

99
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,167
- Ms. Jones.
- Hello, Barbara.

100
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,128
- All right there, Barbs?
- It's "Barbara."

101
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,128
- All right there, Barbs?
- It's "Barbara."

102
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:04,924
{\an8}If possible, could I get two tickets
for the Richmond-West Ham match?

103
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,051
{\an8}Jack might be coming to London
this weekend.

104
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,303
Of course.

105
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,764
Who's Jack?

106
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:13,683
Jack Danvers.

107
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:18,105
{\an8}The head of the VC
that funded your company.

108
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,691
{\an8}Our boss.

109
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,030
{\an8}Yes. That Jack. Of course.

110
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,908
{\an8}That's not a problem, Barbara.

111
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,703
{\an8}I can let you have some seats in my suite.

112
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,496
{\an8}Lovely.

113
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,750
{\an8}Thank you so much, Rebecca.
That's so kind of you and so efficient.

114
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
{\an8}Keeley.

115
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,300
{\an8}Thanks, Barbara.

116
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,930
{\an8}So, the one thing we cannot do
against West Ham is the False Nine.

117
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,891
{\an8}- 'Cause that's Nate's shit.
- Exactly.

118
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,268
{\an8}So, we decided to go with
our classic 4-4-2.

119
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,520
{\an8}Which is exactly what
that prick expects us to do.

120
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,399
{\an8}So, we do the opposite.
Five up front. Full-on attack.

121
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,398
{\an8}So, we do the opposite.
Five up front. Full-on attack.

122
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,943
{\an8}But Nate knows we're gonna do that,

123
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:09,990
{\an8}because Nate knows that we're trying to
outthink him by thinking like him.

124
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,785
{\an8}Well, fuck Nate, fuck thinking
and fuck fucking Socrates.

125
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,121
{\an8}So, we gotta stop thinking like Nate
and start thinking

126
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,916
{\an8}like Nate would think we would think
if Nate were thinking like us,

127
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,084
{\an8}and then do the last thing
that Nate thinking like us

128
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,172
{\an8}thinking like Nate thinking like us
would ever expect us to do.

129
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:30,676
{\an8}Have Zava drop back
and play Nate's False Nine.

130
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,970
{\an8}Voi-fucking-là.

131
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,221
{\an8}Brilliant.

132
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,474
{\an8}- It's mostly Beard's idea.
- Nah, it was a group effort.

133
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,600
{\an8}I do have one question.

134
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,977
{\an8}- Of course.
- Who fucking cares?

135
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,813
{\an8}Do you think Zava'll do it?

136
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:49,863
Fuck!

137
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,158
- Good mornin'.
- Hey.

138
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,870
- Uh-oh, what's wrong?
- Roy doesn't think we can beat Nate.

139
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,667
- Higgins doesn't think so either!
- Beard said it to me first.

140
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:01,666
- Higgins doesn't think so either!
- Beard said it to me first.

141
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,794
- You throw me under the bus? How dare...
- You walked in here this morning...

142
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:08,256
{\an8}- You're gonna sell me out?
- Whoa! Whoa.

143
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:11,092
{\an8}Y'all pointin' more fingers
than Ganesha givin' directions.

144
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,596
{\an8}Now look, you fellas need to calm down
and just kiss.

145
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,225
{\an8}He's right.

146
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,687
{\an8}Keep it simple, smartypants.

147
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,439
{\an8}An answer will show up. Don't worry.

148
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:29,403
{\an8}But until it does,
here's a question for y'all: Am I a mess?

149
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,908
{\an8}Sassy ended up
spending the night last night and...

150
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,286
{\an8}No, hush your butts.
That ain't the headline.

151
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,454
{\an8}Well, I asked her out
on a proper date this morning.

152
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:44,668
{\an8}She turned me down cold. She said I was...
And I quote... "a mess."

153
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:51,382
{\an8}- Yeah.
- Sounds like a case for the Diamond Dogs!

154
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,842
Release the hounds.

155
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,053
Yeah, here we go! Let's do it.

156
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,893
- Fuck's sakes.
- Fuck's sakes.

157
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:06,898
Yes.

158
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,650
- "Yes" what?
- Yes, you're a mess.

159
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,485
Okay. Expound.

160
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,695
{\an8}We're playing Nate this week,

161
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,376
{\an8}and you're acting like
it's not a big deal.

162
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,866
{\an8}Nothing's different. He didn't hurt you.

163
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,826
{\an8}Hey, look,
we ain't talking about Nate right now.

164
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,913
{\an8}I'm asking you if you think I'm a mess.
All right?

165
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,080
{\an8}Higgy pie, what do you think?

166
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,919
{\an8}I think I don't understand
how you're not pissed off with Nate.

167
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,713
We have a saying
in Co-Dependents Anonymous.

168
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,509
- Y... What?
- Jane makes me go with her.

169
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,343
Yeah.

170
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,887
{\an8}Pain is like carbon monoxide.

171
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,890
{\an8}Expressing it to the person
who hurt you is like opening a vent,

172
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,185
{\an8}but holding it in will poison you.

173
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,771
{\an8}I like that.
But Nate didn't hurt me.

174
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:47,940
Bullshit!

175
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,068
Roy, did you wanna get in
on this Diamond Dog situation?

176
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,737
- Hey, Roy! Hey, Roy.
- Hey, Roy. Here, Roy.

177
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,906
Here, Roy. Come here, Roy.

178
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,950
La, la, la, la, la!

179
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:02,996
{\an8}So, the match of the week
is clearly Richmond and West Ham.

180
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,995
{\an8}So, the match of the week
is clearly Richmond and West Ham.

181
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,790
<i>Now, it's been a strong start
to the season for both of these teams,</i>

182
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,001
<i>but I think the Hammers are favorites,
going into the London derby,</i>

183
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,090
<i>based on the tactical acumen
of the Wonder Kid, Nathan Shelley.</i>

184
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,260
<i>Yeah, Shelley is brilliant,
there's no doubt about that,</i>

185
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:20,888
<i>but Zava, he is a genius.
I like the Greyhounds for this one.</i>

186
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,265
That's my guy!

187
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,226
No, you can't have him. He's mine.

188
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,063
- Let's move on, shall we, to Sunday's...
- Hey, look. Guys, guys.

189
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,232
Who cares, right?

190
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,318
Now come on, we've got work to do.
Let's go.

191
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,320
He is correct.

192
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,619
We must ignore these talking faces.
Even when they are in our favor.

193
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,663
Thank you, "Zorro."

194
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,250
Exactly,
but it's actually pronounced "Zoreaux."

195
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,796
Why?

196
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,467
I don't know. Because that's how
my parents say it, I guess?

197
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,597
My friend, you can be
whoever you want to be.

198
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:04,057
My friend, you can be
whoever you want to be.

199
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:09,688
I let all of my children name themselves
once they reach the age of seven.

200
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,984
That is why my eldest is called
"Smingus Dingus."

201
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,323
Dream big, and you may never wake up.

202
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,994
Thank you.

203
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,412
Jesus.

204
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,625
I can't believe I'm about to say this,
but hey, lads, I agree with Zava.

205
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,753
Yes, it's a big fucking game,
but we've just gotta focus, do what we do,

206
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,463
- do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. He's right.

207
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:36,673
And don't forget, yeah?

208
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,972
- Believe in "Believe."
- Yes.

209
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,015
What the...

210
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,768
What?

211
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,895
- Oh, shit.
- What?

212
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,610
- Why the fuck did you do that?
- I was just checking

213
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,571
if I acquired the ability
to chop things in half.

214
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,112
Yeah, and what if you had?

215
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,743
Sorry, bruv. I didn't think it through.

216
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,872
Fellas. Someone ripped this in half.

217
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,416
What the fuck? What?

218
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,293
What the fuck?

219
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,254
You're joking

220
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,383
What the fuck?

221
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:43,949
Hello...

222
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,993
Jade.

223
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,538
Nathan.

224
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,541
Shelley.

225
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,002
Lovely to see you again.

226
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,296
Okay.

227
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,299
- Sorry I've not been around much.
- Sorry I've not been around much.

228
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,675
You haven't?

229
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:06,721
No. No, I've been really busy
with my new job.

230
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:11,476
Big new job just keeping me very busy.

231
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,105
Sounds silly. Maybe you should quit
your big new busy job.

232
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,692
Anyway, just here to pick up my takeaway.

233
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,944
I bought lunch for my whole staff.

234
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,072
Apart from the trainers,
'cause they eat like cows.

235
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,159
Sorry, that sounds... No, they're love...
I mean, they're lovely people.

236
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,494
They're just vegetarians.

237
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,751
No way.

238
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,964
Look who's here. No fucking way!

239
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,841
- Do you know who this is?
- Jason Jelly.

240
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,885
- That's right.
- No, "Nathan Shelley."

241
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,887
That's right, Nathan Shelley,

242
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,891
manager of West Ham United,
in my restaurant!

243
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,768
- Big week, my guy.
- Yep.

244
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,814
Big fucking week.
I'm Derek. I'm the manager here.

245
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,359
- Anything you need, you got it.
- Anything you need, you got it.

246
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,570
- Okay.
- From one manager to another.

247
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,864
Yeah, well, it's not quite the same, but...

248
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,492
Facing your team this week.

249
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,410
That's gotta be hard-core, right?

250
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,829
I mean, you talked a lot of shit
about them in the press.

251
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,793
- Didn't ya? I loved it.
- Sorry, can I pay?

252
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:24,590
No.
This is on me, okay? On me. Understand?

253
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,094
This man's money is no good here.

254
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:31,180
Never charge. Except for booze.
Gotta charge for booze.

255
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,891
I didn't order any booze. It's 12:30.

256
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,563
Knock 'em dead. Go Hammers!

257
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,944
No way. Oi, do you know who this is?

258
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,784
All right, okay. Bye.

259
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,591
And cut!

260
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,551
Lovely, Colin. Thank you.

261
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,346
All right. Okay, Dani, you're up.

262
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:13,849
I'm very nervous.

263
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,851
No. Don't be nervous. Look, just sit here.
Look into the camera

264
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:18,853
and pretend you're talking
to an old friend.

265
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,188
My oldest friend is Javiar.

266
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,690
Great. How long have you known Javiar?

267
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:26,278
Only a couple of months,
but he turns 108 years old next week.

268
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,615
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

269
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,825
Final checks.

270
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,703
Thank you.

271
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,122
- Hello, Keeley.
- Hi.

272
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:41,918
Yeah.
Just scoot to your left a little bit.

273
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,172
Yeah, that's it. Okay, off you go, Dani.

274
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,760
{\an8}You may not know who I am, but I think
the most beautiful parts of a woman

275
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,803
{\an8}are her flaws.

276
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,806
And cut! Thank you, Dani. Next!

277
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,892
Okay.

278
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,688
- Brought you coffee.
- Yeah.

279
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,899
- How's it going?
- Oh, my God. This is great.

280
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,233
- Yeah?
- They're great.

281
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,528
I just... I love being the boss.

282
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,613
- Cheers to that. Yeah.
- Cheers to that.

283
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,990
You ready, Zoreaux?

284
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,660
Yeah,
but I actually go by "Van Damme" now.

285
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,704
{\an8}Okay, great. Action, Van Damme.

286
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,664
{\an8}You don't know who I am,

287
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,376
{\an8}but I'm looking for someone
who likes short walks on the beach,

288
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,964
{\an8}so we can spend more time, you know...

289
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,719
And cut.

290
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,515
Great, thanks, Van Damme. Next!

291
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,018
- Van Damme?
- Yeah. It's my new name.

292
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,229
Cool. Why?

293
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,105
Because I love Jean-Claude Van Damme,

294
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,149
and Zava told me
I should be whoever I wanna be.

295
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,610
- Okay, yeah. Cool.
- All right, Van Damme.

296
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,321
- All right, boys.
- Take it easy.

297
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,074
He's so fucking hot.

298
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,954
- What's his story?
- Jamie? He's so cocky.

299
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,374
But I guess you have to be at this level.

300
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,751
But he only thinks about himself.

301
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,504
At least, he used to.

302
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,048
Joking. No.

303
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,469
But he's not accountable for his actions
and what they do to others.

304
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:19,391
Except he is getting better
at making apologies.

305
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,687
Still, he only thinks with his dick.

306
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:29,109
And yet, I don't think
he's seen anyone in ages.

307
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,780
I just wanna know if I can bang him, babe.

308
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,036
I don't know.

309
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,579
You should probably ask him,
it's his dick.

310
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,916
Cool. Off you go, Jamie.

311
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:53,841
What are y'all still doing here?

312
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,843
Coach, you're gonna wanna watch this.

313
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,136
Is it one of them videos

314
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,305
of a military parent
coming home after a long tour?

315
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,600
'Cause if so, I'm gonna be eating tears
and snot for dinner.

316
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,599
'Cause if so, I'm gonna be eating tears
and snot for dinner.

317
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,684
Not quite.

318
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:46,895
Here we go.

319
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,737
Where'd this come from?

320
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,365
This fucking legend
thought to pull the security footage

321
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,868
when we told him about the sign.

322
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,867
When we told him about the sign.

323
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,660
I guess you can take the boy
out of journalism

324
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,328
but you can't take journalism
out of the boy.

325
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,372
Right, you fucking ruined it now.
The point is,

326
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,876
the answer we were looking for
has arrived.

327
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,626
What are you talking about?

328
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,047
A video like this could
motivate a team, perhaps.

329
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,011
Thank you for your help, Trent.

330
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,805
May a young Robert Redford
portray you in a film someday.

331
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,598
Probably Dustin Hoffman.

332
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,850
- Good night.
- Good night.

333
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,270
Go home, guys. Get some sleep.

334
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:30,813
Okay.

335
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,565
- Good night, Ted. Night, Beard.
- Good night.

336
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,650
Night, Coach.

337
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,117
Coach.

338
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:46,038
I was thinking about your Sassy situation.

339
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:47,581
Yeah.

340
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,123
Jane's sister is in town.

341
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,210
- No, thank you, Coach.
- That's the right answer.

342
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,106
Burning the midnight oil, I see.

343
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,944
Yeah. Sorry for the smell.

344
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,489
The oil burning.

345
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,452
So, you're feeling confident
about this weekend?

346
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,788
Yeah, no, I think so.

347
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,210
Yeah, no. Go... Yeah.
We're gonna destroy, right?

348
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,211
Good.

349
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,422
No, it's just, I...

350
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,885
I just haven't seen Ted since I left and...

351
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,014
We didn't leave on the best of terms and...

352
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,017
I feel like I owe him
an apology or something.

353
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,312
You did what was best for you.

354
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,313
What were you meant to do?

355
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,024
Hang around,
supporting Ted for the rest of your life?

356
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,610
I don't think so.

357
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,911
You've done nothing wrong, Nathan,
I promise you.

358
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,540
You earned this job.

359
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,545
Well, so what do I say when I see him?

360
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,756
You say nothing, apart from "hello."

361
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,510
You look him in the eye.
You shake his hand.

362
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,763
And then you beat him.

363
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,851
And then we go and celebrate.

364
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,187
Okay.

365
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:34,854
Good night, Nathan.

366
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,986
Good night, Rupert. Thank you.

367
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:43,572
Mr. Mannion.

368
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:34,706
Hey.

369
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,041
Working late? Or hardly working?

370
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,293
Well, I don't think
that's how the joke goes.

371
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,504
What joke?

372
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,798
Never mind. What's up?

373
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,636
I really want to win this one.

374
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,013
I know.

375
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,522
Everything okay?

376
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:06,237
Am I a mess?

377
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:07,918
Of course you are.
That's why we get along.

378
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:16,373
And I wish I could tell you
to ignore Sass, but she's usually right.

379
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,919
So, Sassy already told you
about the... Of course. Girl talk.

380
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,588
Girl talk.

381
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:28,218
So, is everything all right?

382
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,012
Yeah, I'm good.

383
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:32,139
Oklahoma?

384
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,982
I'm a work in "progmess."

385
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,072
Good night, Ted.

386
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,328
You already won, you know?

387
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:58,457
You got that turkey out of your life.

388
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:03,879
Beat them.

389
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:08,300
Good night, boss.

390
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,889
Oi, do I look all right?

391
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,599
Of course you do. Why?

392
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,018
Well, if Jack actually shows up,

393
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,017
Well, if Jack actually shows up,

394
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:03,271
I want him to think that I look
mysterious and powerful.

395
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:04,689
Dynamic, you know?

396
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,570
- All of that.
- You are mysterious, powerful and dynamic.

397
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,157
Shit, I'm nervous.

398
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,828
I think I need to go
and reapply my lip liner.

399
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,790
- I'll see you upstairs in the suite.
- Yep.

400
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,044
Hey, Rebecca!

401
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,590
- Rupert.
- Wonderful to see you.

402
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:33,218
- Bex. Love the new hair.
- Hi.

403
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,011
I haven't changed my hair.

404
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:37,139
Nor should you. It's perfection.

405
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,141
So, how's the little one?

406
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:44,270
Oh, yeah, Diane. She's already walking.
Can you believe that?

407
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,191
Yeah.
Drooling and pooing around the house.

408
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:48,901
Takes after her father.

409
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:54,114
Well. Hey, take it easy on us today.

410
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,366
No promises.

411
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,005
Oh, shit.

412
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,475
Excuse me.

413
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,978
I've got a bit of a situation here.

414
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,818
Thank you. But it's actually not that.

415
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,532
You're a lifesaver!

416
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,283
Usually I'm like clockwork,

417
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:42,037
but because I've been so stressed,
I've come on early.

418
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:46,374
I'm so happy that it's a super
and not a skinny.

419
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,125
Who are those even for?

420
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:51,672
It's not like my vagina is on a diet,
I'm on my fucking period.

421
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,882
Oi, thanks for helping me.

422
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,384
And I love your shoes!

423
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,575
- Yeah. Thanks. Pay it forward.
- Yeah.

424
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,681
- Yeah. Thanks. Pay it forward.
- Yeah.

425
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,398
Sorry. Excuse me.

426
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:12,776
Hi.

427
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:15,779
Boy, you're tall.

428
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:18,282
Is your dad a tree or something?

429
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,284
No, I'm screwing around.

430
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,786
Hey, speaking of trees,
who are y'all rooting for today?

431
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:24,913
West Ham.

432
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:27,249
Yeah, no, that makes sense. Yeah.

433
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:36,299
Go ahead. Yeah. Going down one more floor.

434
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,552
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

435
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,096
Best of luck out there.

436
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,156
Hey, Nate. That you?

437
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,783
Hi. I didn't see you there.

438
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,954
- That's okay. How you been, man?
- Yeah, okay.

439
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:08,457
Yeah. Good.

440
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:15,297
Listen, Ted.

441
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:19,675
I just wanna say that the way I left...

442
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,971
Nathan. There you are.

443
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,265
Yeah.

444
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,398
Hey, Rupert.

445
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,485
- Ted.
- Nice to see you again.

446
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,446
Good luck.

447
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,828
- Keeley? Yeah.
- She's absolutely fantastic.

448
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,412
Here she is now.

449
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:52,583
- Hey. Yeah.
- Keeley? This is Jack Danvers.

450
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:53,794
Hello.

451
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,130
I believe you have something of mine.

452
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:00,530
Oh, fuck. You're Jack?

453
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:01,677
Oh, fuck. You're Jack?

454
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:05,054
This is a bit embarrassing.

455
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:07,890
- No.
- Yeah. We all thought you were a man.

456
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:09,768
Yeah, that too.

457
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:11,477
It's like that old riddle.

458
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:13,938
- What riddle?
- You know, always a tricky one, this one.

459
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:15,565
A father and son are in a car wreck.

460
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:19,402
Dad dies instantly, the son is rushed
to an emergency room.

461
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:21,445
A surgeon walks in and says,

462
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:24,240
"I can't operate on this boy.
He's my son."

463
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:25,784
How is it possible?

464
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:28,119
- Because she's a woman.
- She's gay.

465
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,163
- Sperm donor.
- He lives in a simulation?

466
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:33,709
Right.
Yeah, I guess that's a bit dated now.

467
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,587
So, I assume "Jack" is short
for "Jacqueline," right?

468
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:39,506
No. It's short for my father wanted a boy.

469
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:45,721
I'm gonna go and sit
down now, outside. Now.

470
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,014
Jack, welcome.

471
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:50,600
We are not allowed to take drinks
to our seats.

472
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,121
So if you want to get plastered,
we should probably do that now.

473
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:54,563
Okay.

474
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,566
Well, after you.

475
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:02,654
You're so funny, Rebecca.

476
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:07,242
Barbara's obsessed with Rebecca.

477
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,330
I hope she doesn't try and kill her
and wear her skin as a suit.

478
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,251
What the fuck?

479
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:19,171
Cheers. It's gonna be a good day.

480
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,757
- All right, Baz.
- Oi!

481
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,093
This is a Richmond pub.

482
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,804
It's all right, Mae. He's with me.

483
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:34,228
Get the fuck out!

484
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:40,858
Come on, Richmond!

485
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,611
Come on, Richmond! Come on, Richmond!

486
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:45,446
<i>It's a full house for today's battle</i>

487
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:49,450
<i>between West Ham United
and Zava's AFC Richmond.</i>

488
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:53,120
<i>A win would take either team
to the top spot in the table,</i>

489
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:56,250
<i>knocking mighty Manchester City
off number one.</i>

490
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,960
Should be a tight match, Chris.
Any predictions?

491
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,838
I stopped making predictions, Arlo.

492
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,837
I stopped making predictions, Arlo.

493
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:02,255
Because I was never wrong.

494
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:05,591
Got to the point I was worried
I was the one making things happen.

495
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,009
Well, that's interesting.

496
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,177
I knew you'd say that.

497
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,680
<i>They fade and die</i>

498
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:14,767
<i>Fortune's always hiding</i>

499
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:18,521
<i>I've looked everywhere</i>

500
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:22,441
<i>I'm forever blowing bubbles</i>

501
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:26,404
<i>Pretty bubbles in the air</i>

502
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:29,115
United! United!

503
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:32,159
United! United!

504
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,997
United! United!

505
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,374
Nate.

506
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:41,128
Let's have fun out there today, yeah?

507
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:09,155
<i>West Ham are quite happy
to just soak up the pressure.</i>

508
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:12,658
<i>Not taking any risks at all
against Richmond,</i>

509
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,661
<i>of all teams, at home.</i>

510
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:18,873
- A sign of how far Richmond have come.
- It's all right. We're okay.

511
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:20,458
<i>What a threat Zava is.</i>

512
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:23,837
Richmond! To the right!
Tight! Don't get scared.

513
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:32,011
<i>And it stays nil-nil,
thanks to an amazing save by Zoreaux.</i>

514
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,222
- Van Damme.
- Van Damme!

515
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,182
I hear he wants
to be called "Van Damme" now.

516
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:37,100
Why?

517
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:39,781
Well, we'd probably have to dive
into his childhood for that answer.

518
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:44,649
<i>Richmond need the key pass
to unlock the Hammers' defense.</i>

519
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,734
<i>That could be the one.</i>

520
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:48,945
- Tartt hits the woodwork.
- No!

521
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:51,031
- That was close.
- Zava was wide open.

522
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:55,953
For Zava!

523
00:33:56,828 --> 00:34:00,791
<i>- There'll be two more minutes in the first half of this scoreless,
- There'll be two more minutes in the first half of this scoreless,</i>

524
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:02,918
<i>But pulsating, London derby.</i>

525
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:07,463
- Obisanya caught in possession.
- No.

526
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:09,675
<i>And here come West Ham on the break.</i>

527
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,386
<i>Armando bearing down on goal.</i>

528
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:15,638
- Yeah!
- Yes!

529
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,265
<i>And it's there. Right under Van Damme.</i>

530
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:21,227
<i>The Canadian keeper apparently
not as unstoppable</i>

531
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,104
<i>as the Muscles from Brussels.</i>

532
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,982
<i>That's not fair, Arlo. Nobody is.</i>

533
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:27,942
- We've been here before. Come on.
- Come on, lads.

534
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:31,487
<i>The Hammers go up 1-nil
just before halftime.</i>

535
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:34,031
Fuck it.

536
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:37,077
All right, guys. Come on, now.
Let's end this half strong!

537
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,328
Huddle.

538
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:43,958
What's this shit?

539
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:46,127
I don't know.

540
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:48,879
- Lower. Move it right. Five.
- Brilliant.

541
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,440
- Right now, come on. Five.
- Ref, just blow the fucking whistle.

542
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,553
<i>West Ham pressing now.</i>

543
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:58,514
- No.
- A new tactic from the Hammers

544
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,642
<i>in the closing seconds of the first half.</i>

545
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,641
<i>In the closing seconds of the first half.</i>

546
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,561
<i>It's never too late to change, Arlo.</i>

547
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:07,815
- No!
- Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck!

548
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:11,028
<i>And it's 2-nil. Oh, deary me.</i>

549
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:16,617
Excuse me.

550
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,206
How did that happen?

551
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:25,541
<i>We go to halftime.</i>

552
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,585
<i>Richmond have dominated possession,</i>

553
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:31,756
<i>but out of absolutely nowhere,
it's 2-nil to the Hammers.</i>

554
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:33,633
We don't deserve that.

555
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:35,135
What the fuck just happened?

556
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:36,803
I don't know.

557
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,474
Hey, fellas. I'll be right back. Okay?

558
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:42,767
The fuck are you going?

559
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:45,728
- I'll just be a minute or two, okay?
- What do we tell the team?

560
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,064
I don't know. Surprise me.

561
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:55,488
Hey, boss. What you doing down here?

562
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:58,658
I just wanted to tell you
that I believe in you, Ted.

563
00:35:58,659 --> 00:35:59,825
Uh-huh?

564
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:02,955
And I know that I've been
putting an awful lot of pressure on you

565
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,954
And I know that I've been
putting an awful lot of pressure on you

566
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:07,792
to win today, but I just want you
to forget all about that.

567
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:11,588
Just be yourself and have fun.

568
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,048
- Okay.
- Yeah.

569
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:16,009
Okay. Well, thank you.

570
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:19,555
I believe in you, Ted.

571
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:21,890
And it's intense.

572
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:26,395
- I better go. All right.
- Off you pop.

573
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:32,317
Remember, have fun!

574
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:37,906
Yes! This is so exciting!

575
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,413
No.

576
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:54,173
This is your surprise, huh?

577
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:57,885
A minute ago, they were catatonic.
Now look at them.

578
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,472
- They're killers. - Frankly, Ted, sometimes that's good.
- They're killers. - Frankly, Ted, sometimes that's good.

579
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:21,199
<i>Oh, my. Richmond coming out of the tunnel</i>

580
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,452
<i>with a palpable chip on their shoulder.</i>

581
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:28,206
<i>Wow. A real tension on the pitch.
I think we're in for an exciting half.</i>

582
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:31,334
<i>We begin the second half
with Richmond looking for a strong start.</i>

583
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:33,586
- Come on, boys. Fucking kill 'em.
- Fucking kill 'em.

584
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:34,963
- Here we go!
- Kill!

585
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:40,051
<i>That's an awful tackle.</i>

586
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:41,844
- He would be fortunate to escape...
- Oh, fuck.

587
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,179
<i>With just a yellow.</i>

588
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,097
<i>It's a deserved red, and Richmond</i>

589
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:48,393
<i>will play almost the entire second half
with ten men.</i>

590
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,730
He's actually a very sweet young man.

591
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:54,942
<i>Here come West Ham.</i>

592
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,197
<i>- And now Van Damme has been sent off.
- And now Van Damme has been sent off.</i>

593
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,783
- We're playing like Italians.
- I know.

594
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:04,534
It's awesome.

595
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:08,914
Oh, dear.

596
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,844
<i>It's getting a touch spicy out there.</i>

597
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:26,139
<i>Spicy, Arlo? This is vintage vindaloo.</i>

598
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:29,559
No.

599
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,784
<i>Montlaur has lost his mind,
and Richmond have lost a third player.</i>

600
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,004
Fucking come on.

601
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:00,591
<i>- Richmond have completely lost the plot.
- Richmond have completely lost the plot.</i>

602
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:05,137
<i>Zava must be wondering
what he's done to deserve this.</i>

603
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:11,602
Yes!

604
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:14,103
<i>And it's 4-1 to the Hammers.</i>

605
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:17,023
<i>It went from evenly matched
to unevenly matched</i>

606
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:21,068
<i>to light a match on fire
and put it into a can of petrol.</i>

607
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:23,487
<i>That second half should've come
with a trigger warning.</i>

608
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:27,825
<i>One extraordinary goal by Zava
did not make it any less tough to watch.</i>

609
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:31,495
<i>Richmond showed a side of themselves
we've never seen before.</i>

610
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:34,081
<i>They played angry, dirty and ugly.</i>

611
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:37,127
<i>Which are also the names
of Zava's three youngest kids.</i>

612
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:39,213
Shit.

613
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:42,799
Shit.

614
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:45,134
Shit.

615
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,262
- Hey, it's okay.
- Shit.

616
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,309
Did you guys have fun?

617
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,393
Yeah.

618
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:57,439
The violence was quite entertaining,
wasn't it? In a way.

619
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:07,324
Sending off Van Damme was a mistake.

620
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:09,326
He played with passion.

621
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:13,080
"Passion" is a word we use
when we talk about love.

622
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:17,960
It is also a word we use
to describe a crime.

623
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,213
Sometimes it is also a fruit.

624
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,094
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

625
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:51,368
- We fucked up.
- We overcorrected and played with hate.

626
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:56,957
- Be great if you yelled at us a bit.
- Please.

627
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,170
- Call us pieces of shit or something. - Now.
- Call us pieces of shit or something. - Now.

628
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:03,880
You can hit us.

629
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,132
Get it over with.

630
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,011
Tried something new. It didn't work.
Big whoop.

631
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:13,432
I will take that thumb drive
one of y'all's got.

632
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,319
Shake it off, fellas.
Lot of football left this season.

633
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:31,490
- What a fucking arsehole.
- I know.

634
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:34,452
You have to feel pretty good
about yourself after that win, yeah?

635
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,788
Well, yeah. Richmond were clearly rattled.

636
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:39,833
It was easier than I expected,
if I'm honest.

637
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,375
What about Ted?

638
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,254
Quite a snub not to shake his hand
at the end of the game.

639
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:48,841
Did I not? I didn't mean to.

640
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:53,096
I... Guess I just got caught up
in the excitement of it all. Yeah.

641
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,300
Excuse me a minute. I just...

642
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,323
Coach Shelley,
Mr. Mannion asked me to give you this.

643
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:14,701
{\an8}He'll meet you there in an hour.

644
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:18,829
Thank...

645
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,016
- It's so good to see you, Rebecca.
- You too, Bex.

646
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,977
Oh, Rebecca, my dear.

647
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:44,730
- So sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

648
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,150
Come on, old man.
It's way past your bedtime.

649
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:52,364
Lovely to see you.

650
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,284
I saw you with your assistant.

651
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,912
Your daughter deserves better,
and so does Bex.

652
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:01,248
- Stop fucking around.
- Stop fucking around.

653
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,008
Here you go.

654
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:15,011
We are normally a lot better than that.
And nicer.

655
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:19,807
Well, it's never great when your team
gets more red cards than goals, is it?

656
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:20,808
No.

657
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:23,854
What a shit show.

658
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:28,024
Anyway, good news. Bantr's trending.

659
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:29,150
- It is?
- Yeah.

660
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,154
Pretty sure
the change to the bio line helped.

661
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:33,947
What are you talking about?

662
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:39,619
Who did this?

663
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,956
I did. This afternoon,
when I uploaded the vids.

664
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:44,833
You're welcome.

665
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:47,628
- Shandy.
- Yeah.

666
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:53,633
This is the opposite
of what Bantr is trying to do.

667
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,968
Are you joking? They're gonna love it.

668
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:58,555
I've literally tripled their subscribers
in an hour.

669
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,538
You need to change this back, now. Please.

670
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,227
You need to change this back, now. Please.

671
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:05,395
Yeah.

672
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,441
It was really lovely to meet you.

673
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,486
- You too.
- Excuse me.

674
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:20,869
Hey. Here he is!

675
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:24,456
The Wonder Kid himself.

676
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,919
The man of the hour!

677
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,380
Thank you very much, Mr. Mannion.

678
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:34,341
Please, no. "Rupert."

679
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:36,510
Nathan.

680
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:39,220
Thanks, Ms. Kakes. That's...

681
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:43,642
And Nathan,
allow me to introduce Anastasia.

682
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:46,186
Huge fan.

683
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:50,815
Oh, my God. You're famous.

684
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:52,234
So are you.

685
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,741
Congratulations to your victory.

686
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:01,994
Yeah. Thank you.

687
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,504
Come on, Tartt! One more before dinner!

688
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:16,550
Let's go, Coach.

689
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:24,515
<i>That was hard to watch.</i>

690
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:28,436
<i>Thierry, West Ham's domination today
saw Ted Lasso being totally exposed</i>

691
00:45:28,437 --> 00:45:30,521
<i>by his former assistant Nate Shelley.</i>

692
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:33,941
<i>Gary, I love this quote
from a Chinese philosopher, Laozi,</i>

693
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:36,611
<i>"When the student is ready,
the teacher will appear.</i>

694
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:40,156
<i>When the student is truly ready,
the teacher will disappear."</i>

695
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:41,241
<i>The Greyhounds...</i>

696
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:12,022
- Hi, Ted.
- Hey.

697
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:13,648
<i>Sorry about the match.</i>

698
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:16,150
No. That's all right. It was a tough one.

699
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,319
<i>Henry's not here right now.
He's at a birthday party,</i>

700
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,403
- but I'll...
- No, that's okay.

701
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:22,991
I was actually hoping just
to chat with you. You got a minute?

702
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,743
<i>Sure. Is everything okay?</i>

703
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:31,583
Yeah. Well... No. You know, I just...

704
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:35,045
I wanted to say something real quick.

705
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:38,966
Look, I...

706
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:44,054
I know that you and I aren't, you know,
together anymore.

707
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:47,140
And I respect that. Okay? I do.

708
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:55,648
But, Well, you know,

709
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:59,152
this whole thing with you and Dr. Jacob
really ticks me off.

710
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:04,323
And I'm upset that we didn't ever really
get to talk about it

711
00:47:04,324 --> 00:47:06,159
before it all started.

712
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:08,911
Yeah.

713
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:13,625
And look,
I understand that me saying all this,

714
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:17,129
might be the wrong thing to do, but...

715
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,926
I just feel like not saying it...

716
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:27,472
isn't the...

717
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:31,615
Well, wouldn't be the right thing either.

718
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,774
'Cause we gotta raise
this little boy together, you know?

719
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,571
We're stuck with each other.
We're gonna share grandkids.

720
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:50,787
I love you, Michelle.

721
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:54,958
And I love Henry.

722
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:01,548
- And I love our family.
- And I love our family.

723
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:05,177
No matter what it looks like.

724
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:13,185
Okay?

725
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,231
<i>Of course.</i>

726
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:24,196
Well, I'll talk to y'all soon.

727
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:27,741
Have a good night. Tell Henry I love him.

728
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:29,618
<i>Good night, Ted.</i>
