1
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,554
- Morning.
- Morning. Made you some coffee.

2
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,723
Oh, I don't do caffeine.

3
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,935
Right. Your body is a temple.

4
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,105
Well, I don't know about that.
More like a church in an airport.

5
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,069
Big day for Richmond.

6
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,237
Thought you didn't know
anything about football.

7
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,533
Oh, I don't.
But I know who Zava is.

8
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,618
Of course.

9
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,891
Text me when you get back from Dubai?

10
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:28,589
- Safe flight.
- Thanks. Safe driving.

11
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,321
I am a strong and capable man.

12
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,830
Bollocks.

13
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,911
Okay. So obviously Zava's gonna be
moving into our starting lineup.

14
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,957
- Which means, if my maths...
- Mm-hmm.

15
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,666
- ...are corrects...
- Mm-mmm.

16
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,917
...we're gonna have to sit someone.

17
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,418
- Mmm.
- Who's it gonna be?

18
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,878
Well, I think it's gotta be Colin.

19
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,963
Ouch.

20
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:55,091
Mmm. Colin's a chameleon.
He can change depending on a situation.

21
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,094
Bigger issue is, you put Zava up front,

22
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,429
either Jamie or Dani's gonna have
to drop back to midfield.

23
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,224
So, who do we think will take
the news better? Dani or Jamie?

24
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,725
Dani.

25
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:09,189
Yeah. Nah, Jamie's a lot like my mom's
Precious Moments figurines collection.

26
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,107
I have no idea what that means.

27
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,985
- He's a fragile little bitch.
- Mmm.

28
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,738
Brevity is nice, but sometimes clarity
is the true soul of wit. Thank you, Roy.

29
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,783
Um, it's almost ten o'clock,
we should probably get going.

30
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,034
You feeling okay?

31
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,371
A little bit nervous. Um,
had some diarrhea earlier this morning.

32
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,290
- Mmm.
- Uh, please don't put that in the book.

33
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,168
Oh, I've never been clear
on the spelling, so I probably won't.

34
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,919
D-I-A, double R, H-E-A.

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,758
Except in England, you have a silent O,
as in, "Oh, no, you've got diarrhea."

36
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,885
- Ah.
- I'm in the same boat, Higgy bear.

37
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,181
My tummy's got more knots in it than
Wayne's World 1 and 2 smooshed together.

38
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,932
I don't know why. I've been around
great athletes all my life.

39
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,434
Heck, Roy, you're a great athlete.

40
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,768
Eh, not like Zava.

41
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,478
Oh, come on, don't sell yourself short.

42
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,689
If anything, sell yourself tall
and get it altered later.

43
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,941
No, Zava's different. Just watch.

44
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,422
We can't just watch.
We gotta make this fella part of the team.

45
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,030
- Mmm.
- Coaching a superstar can't be all,

46
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,365
- "How do you solve a problem like Maria?"
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,826
Although, if you ask me, the Nazis
were the real problem in that story.

48
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,620
- Am I right, Coach?
- Yeah. Come on, Mother Superior,

49
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,705
- let's have a little perspective.
- Yeah, exactly, yeah.

50
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,874
Sorry, Roy, I know you don't like
all this musical theater talk

51
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,584
- this early in the morning.
- No, I'll allow it.

52
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,712
I used to fancy Julie Andrews.
Well, I still do, to be fair.

53
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:18,799
The voice, the eyes, the way you know
she'd tell you off if you'd been bad.

54
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,802
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,514
All right, we gotta do it. All-time
favorite Julie Andrews character. Go!

56
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,723
Fuck it. Maria!

57
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,434
- Resolute as always. Coach, what you got?
- Eliza Doolittle.

58
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,146
Ooh. Audio-only performance, I love that.

59
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,272
- Professor Higgins.
- Come on you Poppins!

60
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,149
Mm-hmm, same, I'm right there with you.

61
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,943
Trent, you have one?
You don't have to. You got one?

62
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,278
Clarisse Renaldi, Queen of Genovia.

63
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,405
Oh.

64
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,157
Fuck yeah, Princess Diaries.

65
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,284
Deep cut. Zagged.

66
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,622
Wow. Wow. This is nice.

67
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,375
I can't believe it's really happening.

68
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,168
When I was a boy, I played in Zava boots,

69
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,003
I slept in Zava boots,

70
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,465
I made love for the first time
to Zava boots.

71
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,009
Think you mean "in Zava boots."

72
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,511
No.

73
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,887
Hey, you know,
last night at the restaurant,

74
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,264
as the painters were finishing up,

75
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,767
I spent a very pleasurable hour on YouTube
watching Zava's greatest goals.

76
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,603
By the end, my head was spinning.

77
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,438
Though it may also have been
the paint fumes.

78
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,484
The way Zava moves on the pitch...
Like a panther.

79
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,152
So sexy, eh?

80
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,280
Sound a bit gay, bruv.

81
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,364
Well, I'm gay...

82
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,448
Huh?

83
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,409
...for Zava, I mean.

84
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,579
That's true. Some men have a charisma
that transcends orientation.

85
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,997
Uh, Paul Newman,

86
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,875
Idris Elba, Norm Macdonald.

87
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:37,128
Zava is definitely one
of those charisma unicorns.

88
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,172
Okay, you guys have convinced me.

89
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,176
I'll have sex with Zava.

90
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,013
Hey, what's up, man?

91
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,265
What the fuck is this?

92
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,935
All right, fellas, come on. Showtime.
Let's everybody head out to the pitch.

93
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,520
- Let's go.
- Hey Jamie, come on, man.

94
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,148
Hurry up and get dressed. We don't wanna
keep our newest teammate waiting.

95
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,401
- Whoo!
- Let's do this.

96
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,657
We want Zava! Come on!

97
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,540
This is what you get.

98
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,174
Where the hell is he?

99
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,635
Leslie!
We do have a signed contract, don't we?

100
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:29,515
Of course. We have an e-signature.
That's legally binding.

101
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,808
I think.

102
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:34,978
I'll make a call.

103
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,272
His agent hasn't heard from him, but...

104
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,816
...she's tracked his phone
which is currently in Mykonos.

105
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,401
If he has changed his mind again,

106
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,530
I'm going to look
like an absolute arsehole.

107
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,158
Maybe we can try and cheer them up
somehow?

108
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,643
Do you want me to take my shirt off
and run across the pitch?

109
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,580
You must be Shandy.

110
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,208
Shandy's shadowing me for the day.
To get the hang of things, you know?

111
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,335
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,587
I'd love to go for a coffee
and pick your brain sometime.

113
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,465
Like, how tall are you?

114
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:05,716
- Shandy.
- Yeah?

115
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:09,012
Would you go to concessions
and start selling merch at half price?

116
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,264
- Great idea.
- Yeah, thank you.

117
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,932
- Oh, oh...
- Keep your shirt on.

118
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,141
Oh, right. Of course.

119
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,352
Bye, babe.

120
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,647
She's a live one.

121
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,566
Shit. Now I'm late.

122
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,192
For what?

123
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:28,447
Nothing. It's silly. I'll tell you later.

124
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,576
I love mysterious Rebecca.

125
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:35,371
Hey, guys. Are we sure
that Zava has the right address?

126
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,832
I'd hate to think he's sitting
in the middle of Virginia right now

127
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,459
waiting on us, you know?

128
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,545
So, I just talked
to legal about Zava's contract.

129
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,631
Uh, an e-signature is 100% binding.

130
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,552
Tiny wrinkle, instead of signing his name,
he signed "You're welcome."

131
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,512
Shit. What are we going to do?

132
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,015
Hey, look,
superstars play by their own rules.

133
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,726
Back in '98,
I waited over three hours for Public Enemy

134
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,978
to take the stage
of this joint called The Cubby Bear.

135
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,522
When a man with a giant clock
around his neck is that late,

136
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,607
it ain't about time.

137
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,193
- He's making a statement.
- Oh.

138
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:09,697
Right, I'm calling it. We're going to go
upstairs and figure out what we do next.

139
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:13,534
Leslie, I want you to talk to the crowd
and tell them something.

140
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,286
Of course, Rebecca. I got this.

141
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,581
Back in uni, my deejay name
was Damage Control.

142
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,832
I didn't know you deejayed.

143
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,460
I didn't actually, but I had
the name ready if I ever started.

144
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,254
- Shit. Right, come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

145
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,095
Welcome to the Dogtrack.

146
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,640
Who the fuck are you?

147
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,058
Uh...

148
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,355
I can't believe this is happening.
Why does anyone put up with this lunatic?

149
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,857
Because as humans,
we adapt to accommodate genius.

150
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,734
Who is the greatest actor alive?

151
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,152
Or was, before he retired.

152
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,987
- Daniel Day-Lewis.
- Tony Curtis.

153
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,699
Oh, you said alive? Jackie Chan.
Wait, you said retired? Daniel Day-Lewis.

154
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,328
Exactly. When he gets in character,
he stays in character,

155
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,413
and everyone else adapts to him. Ooh!

156
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,374
Did you know, that when he made Lincoln

157
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,043
he actually texted Sally Field
as Abraham Lincoln?

158
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,088
Well, that's ridiculous.
Abraham Lincoln couldn't text.

159
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,923
Exactly.
Every time he looked down at his phone,

160
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,092
his hat would fall off.

161
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:15,722
Look, this Zava might be a genius,
but he's definitely a self-absorbed prick.

162
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,976
Your desk is covered in biscuit crumbs.

163
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:24,188
What the fuck are you doing?
We've waited two hours for you.

164
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:28,234
Oh, time is a construct,
like gender and many of the alphabets.

165
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,903
Oh, get out of my chair!

166
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,614
This is your manager.

167
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,201
Hey, how you doing? I'm Ted Lasso.

168
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,706
My leader,

169
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,544
- I am an empty vessel filled with gold.
- Oh.

170
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,631
I am your rock. Mold me.

171
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,800
Well, hey,
if you score goals like you talk,

172
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,885
we gonna be just fine, buddy.

173
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,804
Right. And this is Keeley Jones.

174
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,474
- She handles all our publicity.
- Hi.

175
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,769
- My queen.
- Oh.

176
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,147
My actions today have made
your job much more difficult.

177
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:10,318
No, don't worry about it.
No such thing as bad press, right?

178
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,154
My integrity disallows me to agree
with that statement.

179
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,115
- Oh, for God's sake.
- He's allergic to hummus.

180
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:21,579
- Yeah, I know, I know.
- Oh, my God. You're here.

181
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,663
And you are there.

182
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,500
And this is Leslie Higgins,
our director of football.

183
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,877
Ah.

184
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,343
You are the glue.

185
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,514
Thank you very much.

186
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,142
Ooh.

187
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,478
I will go see the team now.

188
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:47,523
Ooh.

189
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,985
Do you even know where you're going?

190
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,071
I do not!

191
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,451
Are you kidding me? Wowie zowie.

192
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:04,497
You know what, maybe I
oughta tag along in case he gets nervous.

193
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,874
Seems like he can be
a little bit of a wallflower.

194
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,251
Mmm.

195
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,002
Great. And now I'm in a rush.

196
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,130
Leslie, tell me,
how did the damage control go?

197
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:17,010
- Oh, it was a mess, but he was adorable.
- Oh, thank you.

198
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,429
- Who is this?
- This is Shandy. We work together.

199
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,557
- Oh.
- And she's a great friend of mine.

200
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,352
Oh.

201
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,688
- Hey, did Zava come through here?
- He's here? You saw him?

202
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,523
Yeah, he was upstairs just a second ago.

203
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,983
- What? He's here?
- He's here!

204
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,026
- In this building?
- Yes. He should be here.

205
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,363
Oh, my God.

206
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,824
Okay, maybe we should all
just split up and go...

207
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,243
Oy.

208
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,631
He touched me.

209
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,099
He's like an angel.

210
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,731
Why are you downgrading him?
He is clearly a god.

211
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:30,334
I will begin by addressing
the most important person in this room.

212
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,130
Which of you is the kit man?

213
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,134
Oh, um...

214
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,094
Yeah, he usually...

215
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:46,641
- That's me.
- Uh... I'm Will.

216
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,894
Uh, I am...

217
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,355
- Will.
- Yep.

218
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:02,240
I too worked as a ball boy
for a club when I was just 11 years old.

219
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,783
I'm 25.

220
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,035
Your passion...

221
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,454
is why I play.

222
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,791
Mmm.

223
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,876
And you.

224
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:17,881
My team.

225
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,343
My brothers.

226
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,346
- Breathe with me.
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,892
Right now? Okay, here we go.

228
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,135
We are now one.

229
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,013
There is no me.

230
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,141
There is no you.

231
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,728
- There is only the "we"...
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,064
And the "us."

233
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:21,528
And the we in us.

234
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,455
Okay, so...

235
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,959
Okay.

236
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,504
Um, coaches, let's, uh... let's go in here,

237
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,714
have a word really quickly,
before he scurries off.

238
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,217
Everybody else, just go ahead
and keep breathing amongst yourselves.

239
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,761
He's so much more down-to-earth
than I imagined.

240
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:47,888
- Right?
- Wow.

241
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,450
Which one of these is me?

242
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,161
You're the fucking coach.

243
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,872
- Uh, you know what, we were thinking...
- the top right.

244
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,958
- Fuck's sake.
- Or left, or left, or left.

245
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,710
Whichever one you want really.

246
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,445
I am very excited to be here.

247
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,240
- Oh, hey, we're very excited...
- I will see you tomorrow.

248
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,325
Yep.

249
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,959
He's tall.

250
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,441
Rebecca?

251
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,444
- Tish. Hello there.
- Come in.

252
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:32,910
Come through.

253
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,124
Please make yourself at home.

254
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,969
Yeah, just take a seat. Relax.

255
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,350
Would you like something to drink?

256
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,853
Water? Tea? Or cocktail, perhaps?

257
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,606
Sure, I'll have a White Russian, thanks.

258
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,526
Oh. Yeah,
I'm afraid I'm fresh out of Kahlúa...

259
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,487
- Ah.
- after hosting a Big Lebowski

260
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:13,156
themed birthday party for a colleague.
But would straight vodka suffice?

261
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,867
I was literally just making a joke.

262
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,414
I know. Which is why I made two.

263
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,719
You have been through a lot recently.

264
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:40,853
The dark soul of one man
just disconnected you from your own.

265
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:48,568
And then another beautiful
and worthy soul, in a man half your age,

266
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,072
arrived exactly at the right time.
And the wrong time.

267
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,074
Sorry, how do you know that?

268
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,909
Well, I speak to your
mother once a month...

269
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,829
- Ah.
- for the last six years.

270
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,957
So, Rebecca, how can I help you?

271
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,918
I'm not sure you can.

272
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,337
A skeptic. Well, I shouldn't be surprised.

273
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,673
Oh, because you're supposed to be
a psychic?

274
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:11,800
Oh, no.

275
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,304
Because your mother was a skeptic.

276
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,518
Are you familiar with kintsugi?

277
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,814
It's the Japanese art of mending
broken things, uh, with gold.

278
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:27,982
It...

279
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:33,237
The idea is that... that we embrace
the flaws and the... and the imperfections,

280
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:37,284
and in doing so create something
much stronger and more beautiful.

281
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:40,954
So...

282
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,917
we are going to place our hands
on the bowl.

283
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,294
Would you?

284
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:58,889
Sorry, what's that...

285
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,228
Smells very odd in here all of a sudden.

286
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,563
Thank you.

287
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,567
Let's begin.

288
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,698
I can see something.

289
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:22,079
Mmm, it's in your hand.
An object. It's very special.

290
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:23,830
Is it a bowl?

291
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,167
It's a green matchbook.

292
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,795
Sorry, it's what?

293
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,840
A green matchbook. How lovely.

294
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,258
Sorry, who cares about a green matchbook?

295
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,386
Now I can hear something.

296
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,637
Shite!

297
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:40,888
Oh, for God's sake.

298
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:45,476
No, just one at a time, please.

299
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,478
I...

300
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:50,898
Shite in wh... Shite in nin... Sh... Oh...

301
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,359
yeah, shite in nining armor.

302
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,529
"A shite in nining armor"?

303
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,699
- Does that mean something to you?
- Yes, it does mean something to me.

304
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,534
It means you're even more batshit crazy
than I...

305
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,954
Shut up, I can hear something else.
It's thunder a-a-and lightning and you.

306
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:09,083
And you're upside down,
an... an-an-and you're drenched.

307
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,334
But you're safe.

308
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:14,338
Okay, that...
That's enough I think for today.

309
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:19,720
But thank you so much for your time
and for sharing your,

310
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:21,805
what is it, your gift?

311
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,684
We can just tell my mum
I did the whole session. Yes?

312
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,228
You will have a family.

313
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,858
Sorry, what did you just say?

314
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,611
You're going to be a mother.

315
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:38,780
Fuck you.

316
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,533
I've always thought
you were completely harmless

317
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:45,495
because my mum could afford you,
but you are actually dangerous.

318
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,624
And you're fucking cruel.

319
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,635
So, boys, exciting stuff.

320
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,137
We've got a lot of interview requests
coming in for all of you.

321
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,765
Ooh, ooh. I'd love to get
the word out about the restaurant.

322
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:10,228
Well, right now the press would like
to focus on Zava joining the team.

323
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,312
- Oh. Yeah, okay.
- Oh.

324
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,523
I would rather talk
about Zava than myself any day.

325
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,024
What do you want us to say?

326
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,652
Well, that's up to you.
Go for it. Say anything.

327
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:21,448
I would just, you know,
stay positive, light. Right?

328
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:26,160
Or say something so shocking
your interview goes viral.

329
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,453
Hmm?

330
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,038
- Like you eat your own hair.
- Uh...

331
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,457
- No, I...
- Oh.

332
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,836
Well, uh. Hi, Roy.

333
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:37,004
Keeley, uh, sorry to interrupt.

334
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,089
No.

335
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,301
Uh, Higgins told me
to check in on some dumb interview shit.

336
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:47,098
I mean, some important interview shit.

337
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,560
Don't worry,
nobody in the press wants to talk to you.

338
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,019
No, no. That's not actually true.

339
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,188
The press knows that Roy
doesn't love doing interviews.

340
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,567
Yeah, but it's okay. I'll do one for you
if... if you need me to.

341
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,319
- Thanks, Roy.
- I'll interview you.

342
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,654
Why'd you dump my friend?

343
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,156
- Ooh.
- Ay, ay, ay.

344
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:06,952
You're fun.

345
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,036
Who the fuck is this?

346
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,622
This is Shandy. We work together.

347
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,165
- Why?
- She's an old friend of mine.

348
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,917
That makes more sense.

349
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,753
Shandy. I definitely told you about her.

350
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:20,841
Oh, yeah. Shandy.

351
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,094
You used to eat your own hair, right?

352
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,514
Yeah. I did.

353
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:33,979
Well, nice to put a face to the hair.

354
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,239
- Hey, Coach.
- Mm-hmm?

355
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,365
What's today's Wordle?

356
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,076
- Ethic.
- Ethic.

357
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,414
You're a jerk.

358
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,334
- Hey, Jamie. How you doing?
- Um. Can I talk to you for a minute?

359
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:57,960
Yeah, you can talk to me
as long as you want.

360
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:00,296
Though I do have a tendency
to doze off around 1:00 a.m.

361
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:03,592
- What's up?
- Uh, so look... Uh.

362
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,136
Um.

363
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,138
I know we're all excited Zava's here.

364
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:12,725
Yeah, I get that.
But I know a lot of players like him,

365
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,936
and they're all just
self-absorbed glory hunters

366
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:16,647
who only care about themselves.

367
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,733
Mm-hmm.

368
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:22,902
Uh. Jamie,

369
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:27,908
don't you think that coming from you
that's a little bit ironic?

370
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:31,328
Don't know.

371
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:36,749
But look... the point is,
we don't need this guy.

372
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,793
I... I think we've got
a good thing going here,

373
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,337
and he's already fucking it all up.

374
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,173
Hey, Jamie,
I hear what you're saying, man.

375
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,510
But I think we've got to give it
a game or two and see what's what.

376
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,388
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, no, yeah. Course, yeah.

377
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:53,224
Well, um, thanks for hearing me out.

378
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:56,644
Aight. Thanks for speaking your mind.
Please continue to do so.

379
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:57,729
Yeah.

380
00:23:58,689 --> 00:23:59,897
Oh and, uh... And I w...

381
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:03,652
I weren't being ironic,
I was being hypocritical. That's it.

382
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,907
- Is that right?
- Mmm.

383
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,327
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

384
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,205
So that was actually ironic.

385
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,961
Good afternoon. There is
an electricity today at Nelson Road,

386
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:26,258
and the cause of all this excitement
goes by one name, Zava.

387
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:29,052
Like Pelé, if every letter was different.

388
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:34,266
There are more VIPs here
than London Fashion Week.

389
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,225
I assume. I don't know.

390
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,352
This is all 'cause you got Zava, babe.

391
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,981
You've made Richmond fucking global.

392
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,738
All right. Pop quiz, hotshots.

393
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:52,074
What do you get when you combine
one of Hugh Jackman's finest film roles

394
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,202
with a fancy-pants New York City getaway?

395
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:55,786
Jean Valjean Catskills?

396
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:59,498
Ooh. No. That's a great answer, Sam.
How do you know about the Catskills?

397
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,875
Uh, Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.

398
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,502
Oh, yeah. That's a good show.

399
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:04,128
Yeah. I respect that. Word.

400
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:08,049
No, the answer I was looking for actually
was today's opponents, Wolverhampton.

401
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,718
- Full name, Wolverhampton Wanderers.
- Mmm. Thank you.

402
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,762
- Also known as the Wanderers.
- No.

403
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:14,222
Also known as Wolves.

404
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:17,642
Okay. So, our opponents today are
the Wolverhampton Wandering Wolves.

405
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,394
- No.
- Just Wolverhampton or Wolves.

406
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:24,607
Got it. So when the team
known as Wolverhampton, or Wolves,

407
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:27,902
is wandering around the pitch today
trying to score some soccer goals,

408
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,070
here's the game plan.

409
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,321
Take it away, fellas.

410
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,532
All right, here's your starters.
Here's your subs.

411
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,284
Now remember,
this 4-5-1 is not about dropping back.

412
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,871
It's about getting fucking service
into the box for Zava.

413
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,581
Got it?

414
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,667
Are you all right?

415
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,170
I am still a strong and capable man.

416
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:47,547
You're all right.

417
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,966
- All free kicks will be taken by...
- Zava.

418
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,509
- All penalties...
- Zava.

419
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,136
- All corners...
- Anyone to Zava.

420
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:57,558
That's it. You fellas set 'em up,
and our man Zava's gonna...

421
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,977
Well, he's gonna knock 'em down.

422
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:02,396
Okay? Yeah.

423
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,694
Okay. Uh, let's bring it in.
Come on. Here.

424
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:21,247
Zava.

425
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,666
Zava. Oh.

426
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,418
Am I supposed
to hit the gong or something?

427
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,087
What's up with that shit?

428
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,094
Mm-mm. No.

429
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:38,890
Okay.

430
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,099
I am ready.

431
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,394
Okay. Nicely done.

432
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:44,979
Okay. Here we go.

433
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,650
All right. Okay, Captain,
why don't you go ahead and flip it... Oh.

434
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,280
Richmond on three. One, two, three.

435
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:57,826
Richmond!

436
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,205
Ooh. He's strong.

437
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,334
Yeah.

438
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,213
- The Precious Moments figurine.
- Little bitch.

439
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,593
- How much time we got, Coach?
- Exactly four minutes.

440
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:16,761
Okay, great.

441
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:18,638
I'm gonna call Henry real quick.
Wish him luck.

442
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,348
His soccer team starts the playoffs today.

443
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:21,975
- Nice.
- Yeah.

444
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,727
- Uh-oh.
- What's wrong?

445
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,396
I can't find my phone.

446
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:29,525
Shoot, I know where it is.

447
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,485
I left it sitting on my bathroom sink.
Dang it.

448
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,737
That's what you get
for playing Tetris on the toilet.

449
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,906
Yeah, that and numb legs.

450
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:39,387
You know, that's all right,
I'll persevere. I'll go old school.

451
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:44,581
- Uh-oh.
- What now?

452
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,876
I can't remember
Michelle's cell phone number.

453
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,419
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

454
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,006
- Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
- I think it's just a thing.

455
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,092
Well, yeah.

456
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,094
- You okay?
- Yeah. No, no.

457
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:01,223
I'll just call the house. No, I...
No, I'm good. I'll be right out.

458
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:08,312
Henry, we gotta go!
And don't forget your shin guards!

459
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,523
Okay!

460
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:12,109
- Thanks again for driving.
- Yeah, no problem.

461
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,156
- You still have a landline?
- Yeah. I don't know why.

462
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,242
Are you gonna answer it?

463
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,619
No. It's probably a telemarketer.

464
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,038
Henry, let's go!

465
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,331
May I answer it?

466
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,625
I have a thing for messing
with telemarketers.

467
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,837
- Knock yourself out.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

468
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:34,298
Watch this.

469
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:36,299
Um, hello.

470
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,051
You've reached the house
of Michelle Keller.

471
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:42,555
Who by the way is doing amazing things
with orange slices these days.

472
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:45,016
You're gonna be amazed.
It's really spectacular.

473
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:46,267
How can I help you?

474
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:48,144
Well, hey, Mr. Former President.

475
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,731
Boy, have I got a bone to pick with you.

476
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,901
<i>Hello?</i>

477
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,238
<i>Hello?</i>

478
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,451
Ted.

479
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:06,914
- Yeah. Who is this?
- This is Jacob Bryanson.

480
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:08,706
Dr. Jacob?

481
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:11,668
Yeah. Um, y...
Ted, you can just call me Jake.

482
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,253
Dr. Jacob.

483
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:16,255
Henry, come on!

484
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,633
Michelle. Michelle.

485
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,761
- What?
- It's Ted.

486
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,016
Shit.

487
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,561
- Hi, Ted.
- Uh, hey. Uh...

488
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:31,688
Found 'em!

489
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:35,066
Hey, sweetie. Uh, do you want
to talk to Daddy really quick?

490
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:37,443
- Dad.
- Hey, buddy.

491
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:40,321
We're playing the Dragons today,
and they're undefeated.

492
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:43,202
Yeah, well, you know they ain't gonna
be undefeated for long. Am I right?

493
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:47,078
Um. Hey, look, I was just calling
to wish you good luck.

494
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,663
Good luck to you too, Dad.

495
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:52,667
And please tell Zava that many
of my friends' moms like his abs.

496
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:53,835
Will do.

497
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:55,211
- Bye.
- Bye.

498
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:57,380
Oh, uh, thank you, sweetie. Um...

499
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,798
Uh, Ted, just one second, okay?

500
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,882
<i>Do you wanna wait in the car?</i>

501
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:03,052
- Do you wanna take him to the... Thank you.
- Yes. Of course. Come on, bud.

502
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,055
<i>You ever seen a sunroof? Pretty cool.</i>

503
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,061
Hi. Sorry, uh...

504
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:15,439
Can we chat when we both
have more time?

505
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,941
<i>There's a lot to catch up on.</i>

506
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,610
Um, yeah. No, of course.

507
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:22,781
All good.
I-I'll talk to you later.

508
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:26,994
Ted, I... Good luck today.

509
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:28,912
Thanks.

510
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,968
The Richmond faithful
return to their beloved Dogtrack

511
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:46,637
<i>for the first time
this Premier League season,</i>

512
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:50,057
<i>and surely when they see
the name Zava on the team sheet,</i>

513
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:52,269
<i>they'll think they've died
and gone to heaven.</i>

514
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:56,064
Come on! Let's go! Let's do it!

515
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:01,486
Tartt.

516
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:05,616
What's he doing now?

517
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:08,327
Yeah?

518
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:12,873
Get open. I will find you.

519
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:22,508
Come on, boys! Come on!

520
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,264
Let's go, boys.

521
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,531
My word, he's done it!

522
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:50,953
<i>Zava has scored from the halfway line
seconds into his debut,</i>

523
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,540
<i>and the Dogtrack is in a state of rapture.</i>

524
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,418
- Yeah. All right.
- He might be pretty good.

525
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,879
- Here we go.
- I could get used to this shit.

526
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,384
- Zava! Zava!
- Yes. Yes. Yay.

527
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:21,315
Bumbercatch with the cross.
It's a tricky one for Zava.

528
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,484
<i>Oh!</i>

529
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:27,029
- I cannot believe what I just saw.
- What?

530
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,702
Zava with the scorpion kick,
and Burnley feel the sting.

531
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:41,753
Om.

532
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:47,301
Om.

533
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,984
Richmond up 2-nil over Palace,
who have simply had no answer for Zava.

534
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:06,485
<i>The corner comes in,</i>

535
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:10,824
<i>And it's that man again!
Zava, with a towering header!</i>

536
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,828
Soaring like an eagle amongst penguins.

537
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:43,941
- How do you do?
- Morning.

538
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:47,694
I think it's good.

539
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,238
And then maybe do a...

540
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,324
I think we should put it in.
Do you think we should?

541
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,852
Rojas finds Tartt.

542
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:25,064
<i>Still seeking his first goal
of the season, is this the moment?</i>

543
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:27,984
No, it's Zava again!

544
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:31,486
Zava, Zava, Zava, Zava!

545
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,156
He may have stolen the goal
from Jamie Tartt,

546
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:37,369
<i>but you can't argue
with the instincts of a champion.</i>

547
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,745
If you're a Richmond fan,

548
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:44,418
<i>you've gotta feel that with Zava
everything is going your way.</i>

549
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:46,837
I got a job!

550
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:01,560
Thank you.

551
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:03,728
I mean, the whole thing is just crazy,
you know.

552
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,729
He was supposed to be
helping us get back together.

553
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,356
You know what I mean?

554
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:10,693
It always bothered me the way he'd be
like, uh, "I'm sorry, our time is up."

555
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:12,236
<i>Sorry, our time is up.</i>

556
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:14,530
Nah, that's not quite it.
It was a lot more condescending.

557
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,240
It was more like, "I'm so sorry."

558
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:19,202
<i>Ted, I'm talking about our session.
Our time is up.</i>

559
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:21,871
Oh, right. Sorry I didn't get
to ask any personal questions.

560
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:23,539
I was just yammering.

561
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,543
Ooh. Wow. Gone. Okay.

562
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,171
Gotta respect it.

563
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,508
George, is Ted Lasso
the coach of the year?

564
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:36,219
What? Writing the name Zava
on the team sheet?

565
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,263
Come on. Gimme a break, Jeff.
That's not coaching.

566
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,891
No. What Nathan Shelley's doing
over at West Ham,

567
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:44,228
now that is a tactician at work.

568
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:46,063
Yeah, I like West Ham.

569
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:47,772
But I love Zava.

570
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,149
Don't we all, mate?

571
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:58,115
We're in stoppage time
of what has been an unforgettable contest.

572
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:00,368
<i>Richmond surely would be happy
with a draw,</i>

573
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:03,579
<i>but here's Rojas with a chance
to steal an historic victory</i>

574
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,249
<i>over Manchester United.</i>

575
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:18,177
Zava with a God-like bicycle kick
in injury time.

576
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:20,304
<i>And surely Richmond have won it.</i>

577
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:26,270
<i>A Zava hat trick bringing their first ever
victory in the Theatre of Dreams.</i>

578
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:32,109
Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

579
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:35,654
Fuck it!

580
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,577
And with this victory over Brentford

581
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:45,121
<i>that's six wins on the bounce for Richmond</i>

582
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:48,876
- in this Zava-fueled miracle streak.
- Whoo!

583
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:56,424
You ever think your book
would be a fucking fairy tale?

584
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,926
Come on!

585
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:04,807
Yo! Yo, yo, yo! Hey!
Guys, guys, guys. Yo, yo. Check it out.

586
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:07,895
Listen. Tomorrow,
everybody is invited to the restaurant.

587
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,940
We're still a few weeks
from officially opening.

588
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:15,151
So please, lower your expectations.

589
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:16,445
But it's gonna be an open bar!

590
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:30,626
Zava, Zava,
Zava, Zava, Zava, Zava!

591
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:37,757
- Okay. Okay. What do I need? Um... Hey.
- Hey. Don't serve my food with that face.

592
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,593
Okay.

593
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:41,970
Oh, man.

594
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:44,180
- Hey.
- Sam, this place is lovely.

595
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,349
- Have a great night.
- Aw. Thank you. Nice seeing you.

596
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,809
- Super great place.
- Ah, yeah.

597
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,436
Thank you. I'll come and catch you, yeah?

598
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:51,938
- Peace.
- All right. I'll see you later.

599
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:54,982
- Hello. Um, okay. This is for you.
- Ooh! The smell.

600
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:56,442
- That's for you.
- Nice.

601
00:37:56,443 --> 00:37:59,070
Mate, this is the best moimoi
I've ever tasted in my life.

602
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,906
Aw, thanks, man.

603
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,534
- Look at me. I'm not kidding.
- Hey.

604
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,119
Thank you. Thanks.

605
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:10,289
Sam... is Zava coming?
I made him a friendship bracelet.

606
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,625
Oh, well, I invited him.
Uh, I guess we'll see.

607
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:13,835
Cool, man.

608
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:15,503
Okay, you guys. Enjoy the food, okay?

609
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:16,588
- All right?
- Cool, bro.

610
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:19,465
- Colin.
- Hi, hi.

611
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,759
- Doing good?
- Yeah, you okay?

612
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,344
Boyos, this is my pal Michael.

613
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:24,846
- Hiya.
- What's up, man?

614
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:27,890
- World's greatest wingman.
- Yeah. Tough gig.

615
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,810
"Hello, young lady.
My friend's a professional footballer.

616
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:33,020
May I spend all night talking
to your cross-eyed friend

617
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:34,690
while he hits on you poorly?"

618
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:40,194
Ooh, what did you decide
after Tish's reading?

619
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,905
- Are you gonna go back and see her?
- No. No, no.

620
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,783
It's not for me. If I wanted to be scammed
out of all my money,

621
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,244
I'd go the old-fashioned route
and become obsessively religious.

622
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,787
- Cheers to that.
- Mmm.

623
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:53,207
Well, if it isn't Beauty and the Stink!

624
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,543
Get out! Sassy!

625
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,713
Oh, my God!

626
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:01,257
Hey, ladies.

627
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:03,467
- Hi.
- Welcome to Ola's.

628
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:06,429
- Oh, I'm so happy to see all of you.
- Oh, thanks for having us, Sam.

629
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,015
No, thank you for coming. Please,
make sure you enjoy yourselves, okay?

630
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:11,100
- Absolutely. Thanks.
- Cheers!

631
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,186
Thank you.

632
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:16,023
You are such a twat.

633
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:19,942
- Oi. What can I get you to drink?
- Uh, champagne, please.

634
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:21,903
Champagne? Can we get another champagne?

635
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:23,363
Is Ted here?

636
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:25,324
Told you.

637
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:27,701
You want a beer, Coach?

638
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,788
Michelle and Henry went horseback riding
with Dr. Jacob today.

639
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:35,374
- We'll take two shots of whiskey.
- A single and a double.

640
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,336
A triple. Two.

641
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,630
Weinstein's cock!

642
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:41,631
Are you cheating on me?

643
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:42,716
Yeah, I am.

644
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,927
With you.

645
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:51,600
Man, y'all's baggage
just matches right up, don't it?

646
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,401
See you in a bit.

647
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:06,949
What the fuck do you want?

648
00:40:10,536 --> 00:40:15,582
You frowning while we're on a win streak,
that's a bad look.

649
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,875
You frowned your whole career.

650
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,753
No, I never smiled. That's different.

651
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:24,216
Whoa! Here we go.

652
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,929
- Huh? Good game. Good game.
- Yes.

653
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,223
For fuck's sake.

654
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,685
There he is, God's gift to those
who have everything.

655
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,769
Best player on the team.

656
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,855
Fuck off.

657
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:40,357
It's true.

658
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:45,112
You used to be the best.
Now you're not. It happens.

659
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:46,780
You thought I was the best?

660
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:51,368
Yeah. I mean, you still could be
if you weren't such a pre-Madonna.

661
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,371
- Did you just call me a pre-Madonna?
- Yeah.

662
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:57,499
It's prima donna.

663
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,919
Who the fuck says "pre-Madonna"?
What the fuck does that even mean?

664
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,673
It means before Madonna, female vocalists
didn't have to work that hard.

665
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:07,216
Are you mad?

666
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:09,677
You never heard of Tina Turner?
Fucking Stevie Nicks?

667
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:12,431
Fuck you. Point is,
he's the best player on the team.

668
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:15,725
And right now, all you gotta do
is try and keep up with him.

669
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:18,270
Fuck that.
I don't wanna just keep up with him.

670
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:21,440
I wanna be better than him.

671
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:26,195
I could train you.

672
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,907
But only if you fucking mean it.

673
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:33,410
Yeah. I do mean it.

674
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,165
When do we start then?

675
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:40,876
Right fucking now.

676
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,878
Come on, man.

677
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:45,881
So sorry. We'll take care of it.

678
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,052
We start tomorrow. 4:00 a.m.

679
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,514
Clean that up.

680
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:58,310
All right.

681
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:02,438
I'm gonna do a lap. If Ted's already gone,

682
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:05,358
I'm telling you right now,
I will be attempting to scale Mount Zava.

683
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,235
- Ooh.
- Adieu.

684
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:09,196
Adieu. Good luck.

685
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:13,574
Hi. Hello. Hi.

686
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,201
Hi. Hello.

687
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:17,912
I'm Shandy. I do PR for the club.

688
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:20,873
It's so great you've come down here,
but don't be a dick.

689
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:22,835
Show some love on your socials, yeah?

690
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,048
I like your confident energy.
It's off-putting.

691
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,592
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

692
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:32,678
That's really nice.

693
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:35,471
So how's it going with Shandy?
Is she fitting in?

694
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:38,350
Yes, she's great.
I love how not shy she is.

695
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,101
Oh.

696
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:41,687
Yeah.

697
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:51,196
Wish me luck.

698
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,329
Okay. See you later.

699
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:16,555
Oi. There are better things ahead
than any we leave behind.

700
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:18,348
Oh.

701
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:24,938
Excuse me. One moment.

702
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,981
Hey, hey.

703
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:29,650
Thank you so much for coming.
Honestly, it means so much to me.

704
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:33,738
Sam, tell me, where does your restaurant
source its avocados from?

705
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:38,451
Ah, uh, West African cuisine doesn't
typically feature a lot of avocados.

706
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:40,412
Hmm. Not yet.

707
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,211
- Marlboro Man.
- Hey. Look who it is.

708
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:50,004
I didn't know you work here.

709
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:52,089
Well, how you going?

710
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,799
- Uh, I'm doing all right. Yeah.
- Yeah?

711
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,427
Well, my ex-wife's dating
our ex-marriage counselor,

712
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:58,472
so, you know, that's new.

713
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:01,849
Wow, that's borderline unethical.

714
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,436
Yeah, well, I mean, it all started a year
and a half after we were seeing him,

715
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:08,940
so I guess that's... You ever have anything
like that happen with you and a client?

716
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:10,775
Ted, I'm a child psychologist.

717
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:12,652
Right, right.

718
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:13,736
So, yes. Twice.

719
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:16,656
Hey, whoa. Classic Sassy. I love it.

720
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,825
- Classic Sass.
- Classic Sassy.

721
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:20,494
I got you a surprise.

722
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:25,707
What's this?

723
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:31,129
Thank you.

724
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:33,506
Oh, my God.

725
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:36,218
Don't just stand there. Pass them out.

726
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:41,682
Hey.

727
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:48,939
- What?
- You're being really clingy right now.

728
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:50,858
I am so sorry.

729
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:52,942
Oh, hey.

730
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:55,987
Ladies... a little something
to commemorate the evening

731
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:58,406
and to remind you to come back
again and again, right?

732
00:44:58,407 --> 00:44:59,949
- Mmm.
- Thank you.

733
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,827
No worries.

734
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:04,496
- So chic.
- Mm-hmm.

735
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:08,750
Green.

736
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,548
It's a green matchbook.

737
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,051
You okay?

738
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:25,726
- Yes. Another round?
- All right. Yeah. Okay.

739
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:29,520
- Get another round.
- Can we get another round, please?

740
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:31,898
- Oh. Oh. Thank you, Sam.
- No worries.

741
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:33,065
- This place is wonderful.
- Oh.

742
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:34,901
- Food's fantastic.
- Thank you so much for coming.

743
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,622
- Okay, listen, get home safe, okay?
- Okay.
