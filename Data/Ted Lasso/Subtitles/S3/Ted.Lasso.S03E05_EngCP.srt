1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,006
<i>And with this loss,</i>

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,760
<i>Richmond's dreary winless streak continues.</i>

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,846
<i>Another two goals for Zava are not enough</i>

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,807
<i>as Newcastle dismantle
the Greyhounds 4-2.</i>

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,102
<i>The talent is clearly on the field, Chris.</i>

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,103
<i>It sure is, Arlo.</i>

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,356
<i>The problem with this team
might be in the dugout.</i>

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,441
Damn it!

9
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,360
Fuck.

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,697
Chris, since their loss to Nathan Shelley
and West Ham last month,

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,575
it seems the Greyhounds
have been dropping like a stone.

12
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,788
Well, all objects drop
at the same rate, Arlo. Except feathers.

13
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,750
Well said, Chris.
When Zava arrived, it was sunny days.

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,585
<i>But now, if you're a Richmond fan,</i>

15
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,547
<i>you've got to feel
like nothing is going your way.</i>

16
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,007
Boo! Boo!

17
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,051
<i>Things go from bad to worse</i>

18
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,637
<i>as Richmond welcome Manchester City
mid-week.</i>

19
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:59,100
<i>They are not in form to finally crack
the code against their sky-blue tormentors</i>

20
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,270
<i>as they fall to ninth place.</i>

21
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,482
I knew positive thinking was bullshit!

22
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,659
- Oh. Wow, that's not very nice.
- What?

23
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,996
"Even with Zava,
Richmond eat more arse than your mum."

24
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,789
Buddy, you gotta get off Twitter.

25
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,749
This is a text from my father.

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,460
Oh, boy. I just don't get it.

27
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,628
You know?

28
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,840
The effort was there, as always.
We just can't get over that hump.

29
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,342
I don't know what the heck the problem is.
Do you guys?

30
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,636
- Our defense is in shambles.
- Our offense is stale.

31
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,471
And if the boys
are gonna fucking stand around

32
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,672
watching fucking Zava all fucking match,
we should make them buy fucking tickets.

33
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,854
Okay, so some constructive criticism.

34
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,398
- I appreciate that.
- Mmm.

35
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,734
Hey, Boss. What's going on?

36
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,403
I just have one quick question for you.

37
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,406
Are we ever gonna win
another fucking match?

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,412
Um...

39
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,836
Well, I hear the concern in your voice
and its volume.

40
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,839
And it's funny
'cause we were just brainstorming in here,

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,134
coming up with some real strong solves.

42
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,471
You know what we're gonna do?
Pretend this club was a ship.

43
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,890
We're gonna take that ship,
we're gonna turn around.

44
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,850
Go against the tide,

45
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,651
point that baby right at the North Star
and follow it all the way home.

46
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,979
That's north, Ted.

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,649
- This way is. Okay.
- I'm pretty sure it's that way.

48
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,901
- That's what I meant. That way.
- No, it's right fucking that way.

49
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,154
- You know, I'm discombobulated.
- No! You're all wrong! It's that way!

50
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,573
Shoot.

51
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,158
I think.

52
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,493
Hmm.

53
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,437
- Mmm.
- Can I take this for you?

54
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,898
You can. Thank you very much.

55
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,157
{\an8}Sorry,
do you think you can take this as well?

56
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,952
{\an8}Rebecca.

57
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:27,039
{\an8}John Wingsnight. What a lovely surprise.

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,960
{\an8}- Hello.
- Oh, uh, this is Jessica Darling.

59
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,753
{\an8}Jessica, darling, Rebecca Welton.

60
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,423
{\an8}- It's so lovely to meet you.
- Oh, hi. Likewise. Hello, there.

61
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,508
{\an8}Uh, we actually went out on a few dates.

62
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,095
{\an8}And then Rebecca dumped me out of nowhere.
In this exact coffee shop.

63
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,472
{\an8}Not that I come here all the time,
hoping to run into you.

64
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,183
{\an8}- 'Cause I don't.
- Okay.

65
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,228
{\an8}Well, may I say, Rebecca, thank you.

66
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,606
{\an8}We're engaged.

67
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,650
{\an8}Ring-a-ding-ding. Wedding calling.

68
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:58,154
{\an8}Engaged. Congratulations.
That's... Wow.

69
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,156
{\an8}How... did it happen?

70
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,658
{\an8}Oh, we matched on the apps,
uh, six months ago.

71
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,661
{\an8}Not Bantr. Couldn't use that.
It felt a bit weird since, uh...

72
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,414
{\an8}- Yeah.
- And in a sea of anythings,

73
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,792
{\an8}I went fishing
and caught myself a soul mate.

74
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,960
{\an8}Oh.

75
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,629
{\an8}Took her
to see <i>Hamilton</i> on our first date.

76
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,881
{\an8}- Amazing.
- And then defended my honor.

77
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,759
{\an8}Oh, God. Yeah. Get this.
It's intermission.

78
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,761
{\an8}We're standing in line
to buy the CD of the soundtrack,

79
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,642
{\an8}'cause I refuse to stream music.
And guess who's standing in front of us.

80
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,642
{\an8}- Sir Anthony Hopkins.
- Can you imagine?

81
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,353
{\an8}- Nope.
- Jessica politely taps him on the shoulder

82
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,606
{\an8}and asks if he'll film a little video
for Jessica's father as Hannibal Lecter,

83
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,649
{\an8}you know.

84
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,484
{\an8}- And he said no.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,153
{\an8}So I grabbed that rapscallion
by the collar,

86
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,405
{\an8}and I said, "Hey,
we didn't ask you to be famous."

87
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,952
{\an8}And took a quick ussie of the three of us
and emailed it to her... her dad's nurse.

88
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,119
Made his day.

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,748
My shite in nining armor.

90
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,084
What? I just...

91
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,168
What did you say?

92
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,212
You jumbled your words there a bit.

93
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,298
What did you... You just said,
"shite in nining armor"?

94
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,884
Yeah. I... I meant to say
"knight in shining armor."

95
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,095
I just... One of me brain farts.

96
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,013
Quite rare for her.
She's actually very smart.

97
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,723
Went to Oxford for a bit.

98
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,476
Wait, n-no, you said,
"shite in nining armor."

99
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,562
You actually said those specific words.

100
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,689
I did.

101
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,067
Anyway, uh, we should go.
Lovely to see you, Rebecca.

102
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,279
You okay? Have you eaten?

103
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,873
{\an8}I completely understand
where Barbara's coming from,

104
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,124
{\an8}but as I was explaining to you,

105
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:37,211
{\an8}I'm worried that by adding more clients,
that could mean less attention paid

106
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,130
{\an8}to the wonderful people
we already represent.

107
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,924
{\an8}And then I... I reminded Keeley,

108
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,262
{\an8}as you've said so many times, Jack,
that, um, if it does get to the point

109
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,097
{\an8}where we feel
we're spreading ourselves thinly,

110
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,725
{\an8}then we'll hire more people.

111
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,435
{\an8}It's called "growth."

112
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,898
{\an8}- Okay. Uh, let me weigh in here.
- Oh, please.

113
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,566
{\an8}- I agree with Keeley.
- Well, that's great.

114
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,154
{\an8}Being a small boutique firm
is exactly what sets you apart.

115
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,698
{\an8}You want a restaurant to look successful,
you take out half the tables

116
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,159
{\an8}and you have a line out the door.

117
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,118
{\an8}I say let's go for it.

118
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,955
- Hmm.
- No, that's wonderful. Yeah.

119
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:17,711
And instead of salaries,
we can give away the tables we threw out.

120
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,382
- Don't worry, Barbara. It'll be great.
- Oh, yeah. Yes. Definitely.

121
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,804
{\an8}You ever think
sunshine gets jealous of her?

122
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,973
- Knock, knock.
- Hi, babe.

123
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,059
Now that your little, uh,
cool girls meeting's done,

124
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,520
just wanted to share the exciting news
that I've started an app.

125
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,646
Oh.

126
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,940
{\an8}It's like Bantr,
but it's better and cooler

127
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,194
{\an8}and actually cares about helping people
have sex with celebrities.

128
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:43,986
{\an8}What? Shandy.

129
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,114
{\an8}It's called "Star Fuckr."

130
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,286
{\an8}And, yeah, we are looking for investors.

131
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,294
{\an8}I take it she's still angry
about the whole Bantr thing?

132
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,088
Oh, yes. Mmm.

133
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,550
Shandy does not have a good relationship
with rejection, or her ex,

134
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:09,805
or with the workplace,
or most nouns, really.

135
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,975
"You are so passionate,
but I have to let you go.

136
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,771
I'm sorry, but I know someone as brilliant
as you will land on their feet."

137
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,481
What did I do?

138
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,775
No, no, no, no. Keeley, sor... sorry.

139
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,986
That's what you say when you fire Shandy.

140
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,738
Oh, my God.

141
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,283
{\an8}Sorry.

142
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,159
It's called a compliment sandwich.

143
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,163
You... You give someone bad news,
but to soften the blow,

144
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,041
you slap it between two delicious slices
of compliments.

145
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,254
Oh. But I can't fire Shandy.

146
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,422
She'll hate me.

147
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,215
And she really thinks she's killing it.

148
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,550
Oh, I am sure she does.

149
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,635
The worst people
often think they're the best.

150
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,722
My dad calls it "talent dysmorphia."

151
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,932
That's good.

152
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,102
You wanna get some lunch?
My... My meeting just got pushed.

153
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,353
Abso-fucking-lutely!

154
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,482
Yeah, my stomach started grumbling
when you said "compliment sandwich."

155
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,411
- Aw, shit. Come and look at this.
- Ooh.

156
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,332
Man, how the fuck
does Nate bag a baddie like Anastasia?

157
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,708
Oh, maybe she made a bet.

158
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,418
- Oh. In, like, <i>She's All That</i>.
- Yeah.

159
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,088
Yes! But Nate does not have glasses
and a ponytail hiding his beauty.

160
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,173
Nah, fuck no.

161
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,966
His transformation's gonna be
on the inside.

162
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,426
- Yeah.
- You know, <i>She's All That</i>

163
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,762
is just the film version of the musical
<i>My Fair Lady</i>.

164
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,306
Which is based
on the George Bernard Shaw play <i>Pygmalion</i>.

165
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,391
I love pigs. They are cute

166
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,436
but also have the same intelligence
as a human toddler.

167
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,437
Yeah,
but Anastasia's just really fit, innit?

168
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,638
- Oh, yeah. She's very pretty.
- She's the coldest, bro.

169
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,653
Hey, Zava. What do you think of Anastasia?

170
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,614
I don't.

171
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,243
My wife, Christina, is the only woman
I see with clarity.

172
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,413
Every other woman is a smudge.

173
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,331
Wow.

174
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:04,002
My wife is sexy,
but in a girl-next-door kind of way.

175
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,338
Glasses, ponytail, she paints.

176
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,841
Like the girl in <i>She's All That</i>.

177
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,343
- Like what?
- It's a movie.

178
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:16,180
Oh, I don't care about,
uh, moving pictures.

179
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,475
My favorite thing to watch is my wife.

180
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,186
Wow.

181
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,606
If we stay with our 4-5-1, we're fucked.

182
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:30,278
If we move to 4-4-2, we're fucked.
But if we try a 5-3-2...

183
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,946
- We're gonna win?
- We're fucked.

184
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,032
- Shoot. Hmm.
- Man City.

185
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,119
I can't believe our white whale
has the same name as the strip club

186
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,289
where I danced in college.

187
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,250
Um...

188
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,419
What's going on, Trent?
You got an idea for us?

189
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,589
Um, no, I can't. I'm, uh...
I'm only here to observe.

190
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,341
- I... I couldn't, um, interfere.
- I get it.

191
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,262
You know, you're kinda like one
of them sadistic nature documentarians

192
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,638
that won't put down their camera

193
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,101
even though they see a poor, defenseless,
adorable, little, injured monkey

194
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,938
about to get attacked by a pack of hyenas.

195
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,039
All right. Okay.

196
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,833
Have you ever considered
an old-school long-ball game?

197
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,877
- Oh, what, like route one?
- What's that?

198
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,421
A kick-and-rush tactic
that can be a viable option

199
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,090
for an overmatched team
against a superior opponent.

200
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,009
Okay, well, great. Let's do that then.

201
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,844
Nah, their center backs are too athletic.

202
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,013
- They'd murder us.
- Yeah, you're fucked.

203
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,724
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

204
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,275
- Uh...
- Everything okay, Ted?

205
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:54,488
Uh,
Henry got bullied at school this morning.

206
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,198
If we leave right now

207
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,784
and take the connecting flight
through Paris,

208
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,244
we can be in Kansas by noon,

209
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,829
and that punk's house
will be in ashes by 12:30!

210
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,125
No, no. Best thing you can do
with bullies is ignore them.

211
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:13,464
Then you sneak into their house
at 4:00 a.m.,

212
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,966
which, statistically speaking,

213
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,677
is the hour people are least prepared
to defend themselves.

214
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:18,595
Correct.

215
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:22,891
And once you're standing over them,
as they sleep in their bed,

216
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,143
you start to beat them.

217
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:31,775
With a thick, heavy rope
soaked in red paint.

218
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:37,239
Pummeling them over and over
until they wake,

219
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,284
confusing the paint for their own blood.

220
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,412
When they beg you to stop,

221
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:48,500
you laugh as loud as you can,

222
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,420
for as long as you can.

223
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:56,758
And then you start to beat them again.

224
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,226
Mmm. Yeah.

225
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,771
You know,
I may just hold off on anything like that

226
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,940
until I connect with Michelle
and just get the details,

227
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,358
see what actually happened.

228
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,735
Yeah, all right. Yeah, fair enough.

229
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,779
- But thank you.
- Pleasure.

230
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,744
Hmm.

231
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:25,454
Rebecca, do you have a moment?

232
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,122
Of course.

233
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,211
May I have a seat?

234
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:35,506
Leslie, this formality
is really freaking me out. Just sit.

235
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:46,140
The thing is,
the club is going in the wrong direction,

236
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:50,102
and I fear that it has little to do
with the quality of our players.

237
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,982
Therefore, if we don't do well
against City, we may have to consider...

238
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,944
Think about thinking about possibly,

239
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,239
maybe focusing on theoretically,

240
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,117
as it were,
changing the manager of our club.

241
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,619
You want to fire Ted?

242
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,291
At what point during any of that
did it seem like something I wanted to do?

243
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,460
Leslie,
this is too bleak for me at the moment.

244
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,255
Therefore, I am granting myself permission
to change the subject.

245
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,091
Do you believe in psychics?

246
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,802
Oh. Uh, yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.

247
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,095
Why doesn't that surprise me?

248
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:27,431
I mean you're so, I don't know whimsical.

249
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,686
Thank you.
My Aunt Devorah has a touch of the shine,

250
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,688
a little bit of the inner eye.

251
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:37,818
And she predicted that Julie and I
would have five children, all boys.

252
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:39,694
And look at us now.

253
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,531
Just a house
full of soaking wet toilet seats.

254
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,615
Uh, why do you ask?

255
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,617
Oh, a few weeks ago,

256
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:49,705
I sort of went and saw a psychic.

257
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,915
Not sort of. I... I completely saw one.

258
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,294
Wha... Wow!
What did she say about the season?

259
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,837
- I didn't ask.
- Ah.

260
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:02,091
She was a bit of a quack. But she did say
a couple of things would happen,

261
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,302
and now they've happened.

262
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,386
Mmm.

263
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,763
That's odd, isn't it?

264
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,975
The universe is full of things
we can't explain, Rebecca.

265
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,561
Fingernails. What's that about?

266
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,688
And psychics,
even if some of them are charlatans,

267
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,024
they can help us see
something in ourselves

268
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,445
that we can't quite see ourselves.

269
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,073
Thank you, Leslie.

270
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,868
Mmm. Hmm.

271
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,672
Oh, hello, Ms. Kakes.

272
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,552
- From Rupert?
- My friend Anastasia.

273
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,638
She wants you to call her.

274
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,059
She was surprised you didn't ask
for her number at Bones & Honey.

275
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,698
Well, I didn't want to appear too forward.

276
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,736
Okay.

277
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,415
Oh, um, hello.
Uh, I'm glad that I've caught you.

278
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,251
It's, uh, Nathan Shelley.

279
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,628
Uh, I really enjoyed meeting you
the other night,

280
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,257
and I was hoping that we could meet
for another drink.

281
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:28,262
Yeah, sorry, Mum. I'm just, uh,
practicing for the... Yeah. How was I?

282
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:33,683
"I think we should meet for another drink"
is more direct.

283
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:36,936
Yeah. Okay, yeah. Thank you.

284
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,064
All right, love you. Bye-bye. Bye.

285
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,149
{\an8}Okay.

286
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,819
Should go for another drink. Should.

287
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,954
- Hey, Coach.
- Hello, Rebecca.

288
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,667
- Ted.
- No, I know, I know, I know.

289
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:03,547
You are still feeling bad
about yelling at me the other day, right?

290
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,966
I can be a little bit psychic.

291
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,260
{\an8}It's okay.

292
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,722
No, yes, I... I shouldn't have bullied you.

293
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,561
- Nice speaking with you, boss.
- You too, Ted.

294
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,490
Afternoon.

295
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,373
Hi.

296
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,167
Ms. Jones.

297
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,836
- Hope you enjoyed your lunch with Jack.
- Mmm.

298
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,796
Um, just a quick question.

299
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,759
Did you tell Shandy to call Emma Jayye
at 4:00 in the morning,

300
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,513
whilst drunk on "espresso martinis,"

301
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,725
to pitch her an idea
for "condoms for balls"?

302
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:00,938
- What?
- Emma Jayye designs sunglasses.

303
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,773
Yeah, no, of course I didn't do that. Why?

304
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,608
Oh, because she just fired us.

305
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:08,778
Because of Shandy.

306
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,489
Because of your friend.

307
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:14,242
Shandy.

308
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,661
- Yeah?
- Can I speak with you, please?

309
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:19,705
- Can you give me 30 minutes?
- No, now.

310
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,459
- Please can I watch?
- Barbara.

311
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,131
Hi. I can give you five minutes,

312
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,384
then I have to go downstairs
and meet with a potential assistant.

313
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,512
She's scared of elevators.
It's cute, right?

314
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,097
Can you come have a seat, please?

315
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,182
Yeah.

316
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,403
Shandy.

317
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,614
Am I getting a raise?

318
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,451
You are so brilliant.

319
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,162
But...

320
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,335
My bold determination? What the fuck?

321
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,757
All right! Listen up, sheep.

322
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:15,804
I was just let go because some people
can't handle working with an innovator.

323
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:21,226
So, I'm starting my own PR firm
to take this place down.

324
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:23,896
Who's coming with me?

325
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,692
I'll pay you double
what you're making here.

326
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:30,777
Who's coming with me?

327
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,114
All right.

328
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,491
Three months holiday every year,
company car,

329
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,870
massage table in the office
with a licensed masseuse.

330
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,206
Who's coming with me?

331
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,751
I'll go with you.

332
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,961
- Not you, Dan.
- Right.

333
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,257
Barbara. I know you're with me.

334
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,550
I couldn't be less with you.

335
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:59,764
That's because you're a coward,
and I fucking hate you.

336
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,558
I hate all of you!

337
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,894
Oh, Keeley, please let me stay.

338
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:08,272
I just love it here so much.
We're a family.

339
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,066
- I love you.
- You're gonna be fine, Shandy. I pro...

340
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,317
No, I'm not!

341
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:15,572
Oh, you bunch of fascist fucks!

342
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:22,912
I fucking... You fucking ten-percenters.

343
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,289
Yeah, that's what you are.

344
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,544
You know what? Fuck you all.

345
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:30,337
That's ours.

346
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,423
Well, fuck off then.

347
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,591
Dan, let's go.

348
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,969
Actually, I'm staying.

349
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,138
Suck my dick.

350
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,266
All right.

351
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,187
Mmm.

352
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,480
Well, I'm not gonna say it.

353
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,648
No, but you're gonna think it.

354
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,901
Yes, often. And forever.

355
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:07,331
Hello, there. I'm Rebecca Welton.
I have an appointment with Dr. Wagner.

356
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,041
Fill this out,
and he'll be right with you.

357
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,128
- Ah, thank you so much. Thank you.
- Take a seat.

358
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,995
- Rebecca. What a nice surprise.
- Ah.

359
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,122
- You don't have to fill out all that junk.
- Oh.

360
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,791
Come on back, my dear.

361
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,213
- Thank you.
- Take a seat.

362
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,854
- Yep. Thank you.
- Make yourself at home.

363
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:06,350
So, how are you holding up?

364
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,978
Given Richmond's current slump?

365
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,940
You poor thing. So stressful, it must be.

366
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:17,026
Well, it's been a bit tough, I'll admit.

367
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:20,988
But, um,
we're just in a bit of a bad stretch.

368
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,324
Well, it will all work out. I know it.

369
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,743
As long as you have Zava,
you'll be just fine.

370
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,287
- He's amazing, isn't he?
- He is. Yes.

371
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,998
Yes, we're, uh... we're lucky to have him.

372
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,794
So tell me, what brings you in today?

373
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:40,800
Right. So, um, you know, I'm...
I'm aware that what I'm about to ask,

374
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,555
given my age, uh, is a bit far-fetched.

375
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:48,015
But I was just wondering if...

376
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,352
If you're able to have children?

377
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,021
Yes. That.

378
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:55,274
It's not far-fetched at all.

379
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,278
I treat women your age, and older,
all of the time.

380
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:01,613
- You do?
- Absolutely.

381
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,866
Now, that said, I can't guarantee...

382
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,701
Oh, no, of course. I know.

383
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:10,414
But we can run some tests
and see what's possible. Sound good?

384
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,040
Great. Yep. Thank you.

385
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,709
Well, uh, sit tight, relax.

386
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,296
I'll have our tech, uh, take some blood
and do some imaging.

387
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,923
- Wonderful to see you.
- Likewise.

388
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,259
Go Richmond!

389
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,447
Right, listen up.

390
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,576
When you're leaving,
get yourself a shower. Get some rest.

391
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:51,705
More importantly,
no video games before bedtime.

392
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,291
Unless it's Animal Crossing.
That shit's fucking soothing.

393
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,211
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Well done, guys.

394
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,213
You know, I think we're really starting
to turn our fortunes around.

395
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:02,591
- Well, actually, Sam...
- Jan Maas, no need.

396
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,760
Sam, we're playing like shit,
and we all know it.

397
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,595
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

398
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,557
Hey. Enough of that negativity.

399
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:14,310
Yeah, City are great. They just are.

400
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,646
But who the fuck cares? 'Cause so are we.

401
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:20,108
So stop acting
like a bunch of little bunny rabbits.

402
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,694
Let's fucking do this, yeah?

403
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:29,868
Jamie is so right.

404
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,457
It's as if he were Zava.

405
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,375
Get off me, man.

406
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:40,295
You see, I am no prophet.

407
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,090
Prophets believe in something.

408
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:45,801
I do not just believe.

409
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:52,432
I know in my heart, in my bones,

410
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,561
in my well-defined delts, traps and glutes

411
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:59,897
that there is no opponent
this team cannot conquer.

412
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,482
I literally just said that.

413
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,111
You will not win because of me.

414
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:09,616
You will win because you work together.

415
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:11,827
Because together...

416
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,874
you can achieve anything.

417
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,921
Manchester City is going down!

418
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,899
Hey. There you are.

419
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,026
<i>Hey, Ted.
I'm sorry we kept missing each other.</i>

420
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:47,362
That's okay. I get it, you know?

421
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:49,280
How's the little guy doing?

422
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,533
<i>He's okay.
He's actually at the park right now.</i>

423
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,784
He is? Oh, that's great.

424
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:57,039
<i>Yeah. Jake thought it'd be a good idea
to get outside, get some fresh air.</i>

425
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:02,251
Yeah. No, that's, uh...
That's... that's smart. Yeah.

426
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,712
Um, what about you? How are you doing?

427
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,797
<i>Oh, I've definitely been better.</i>

428
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:07,883
I hear you.

429
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,969
I've been pulling my hair out
all day over this.

430
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,763
You know, I actually told Beard and Roy
about what happened.

431
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,057
Those fellas were ready
to hop on a flight to Kansas

432
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:18,894
and go full Wicked Witch of the West
on the kid that bullied him.

433
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:25,067
<i>No, Ted, um, Henry wasn't bullied.
He was the bully.</i>

434
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:27,694
What?

435
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,739
<i>AFC Richmond versus Manchester City.</i>

436
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,617
<i>Normally, the Greyhound faithful
mark the loss on the calendar</i>

437
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:36,203
<i>before the match is even played.</i>

438
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,455
<i>But tonight, with Zava, hope is in the air</i>

439
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:43,335
<i>that Richmond will finally prevail
in this decidedly one-sided rivalry.</i>

440
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,380
It's, uh, quitting time.

441
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:48,924
I'll see you tomorrow, Dan.

442
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:50,592
No.

443
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:52,845
I quit.

444
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,639
No, no. I'm joking.

445
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,851
U-Unless you want me to quit?

446
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:02,979
- No, I'd love to see you tomorrow, Dan.
- Okay.

447
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,523
- Night.
- All right. Thank you.

448
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:10,194
- Good night, Ms. Jones.
- Oh, night, Barbara.

449
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,904
- Barbara?
- Oh.

450
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,489
Ooh!

451
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,326
Do you wanna go see
the Richmond match tonight? Either of you?

452
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,663
Will it be as violent as last time?

453
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:22,708
- Probably not.
- Then no.

454
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:25,127
I'll tag along.

455
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:27,008
Uh, can I borrow your office
to make some calls?

456
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,297
Oh, yes, of course. Yes.

457
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,675
Just don't look in my desk drawer.

458
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,052
Don't.

459
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,350
I'm definitely gonna look
in those drawers.

460
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,895
Mmm-hmm.

461
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,238
Zava! Zava!

462
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:58,034
Zava! Zava! Zava! Zava!

463
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,118
Peel 'em.

464
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,203
Slice 'em.

465
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,287
- Cut 'em.
- Yeah.

466
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:02,663
- Mash 'em.
- I'm not playing.

467
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,457
- Cheer until your voice bleeds.
- Okay.

468
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,583
Eat 'em.

469
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:07,544
- Outclass 'em, Sam.
- Thank you, Coach.

470
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,799
Oi. Where's Zava?

471
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:22,391
Hey, Coach. Check it out.

472
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:25,436
115 straight days,
no pee drops on the khakis. New record.

473
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,688
Proud of you.

474
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:30,650
You connect with Henry yet?

475
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:32,027
No, keep missing each other.

476
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:35,988
Why can't the world just have
one big time zone, you know?

477
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:40,451
- The sun.
- Right, the gosh-dang sun. Oy, oy, oy.

478
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:43,412
Henry's a good kid, 'cause you're his dad.

479
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:44,747
Mm-hmm.

480
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,751
And whatever's going on with him,
he's gonna be just fine.

481
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,962
Thank you, Coach. I needed to hear that.

482
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:53,215
No, you needed to hear it.

483
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,634
- That's what I said.
- You did?

484
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:59,137
We got a fucking problem.

485
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:07,104
Oh. Is that my...

486
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:10,398
Two questions. Um, are you ready
to leave for the match?

487
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,735
And do you smell that awful stench?

488
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,196
Yes and yes.

489
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,827
Oh, my God. What was that?

490
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,748
That is fucking weird.

491
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,293
Oh! Wow!

492
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,752
What the fuck?

493
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,172
Where did that come from?

494
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,466
Oh, my God.

495
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:43,891
"The lion has left.
Enjoy the lamb, bitch. XOXO, Shandy."

496
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,643
Jesus.

497
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,439
It's a gentle reminder
to cancel her security badge.

498
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,192
Fuck me.

499
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,491
Oh, my God! That is so sour.

500
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,081
After you.

501
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,416
Oh.

502
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,502
Ooh.

503
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:19,383
Hello, Jade. Um, Shelley.

504
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,637
Uh, reservation for two. Thank you.

505
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,264
And you, miss? How can I help you?

506
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,892
- Oh...
- Oh, no, she, uh... We, uh...

507
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:29,352
This is Anastasia.

508
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:33,982
Uh, she is a very famous model, uh,
and we are on a date.

509
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:38,320
Togeth... Together.
Two. For two.

510
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:39,946
Hello.

511
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:43,366
Um, you have very cute head.

512
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,868
Thank you. I got it from my father.

513
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,579
- Right this way.
- Oh, no. Sorry, Jade, dear.

514
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,375
Uh, we would like the, uh,
window table, please.

515
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,379
- I'll have to go ask Derek.
- I already checked with Derek.

516
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,008
Oh, Nathan Jelly! The wonder kid!

517
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,218
Yeah. Touch it.

518
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:03,512
- Hey!
- Uh-huh.

519
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,556
And, whoa, whoa, whoa.

520
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,391
Slap me round the face. Am I dreaming?

521
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:11,019
The one and only Anastasia
in my restaurant.

522
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:14,022
I'm a huge fan of your face and body.

523
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:18,819
Best table in the house for you two.
If you'd like to come this way?

524
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:25,200
Oh. Yeah.

525
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:32,832
There you go.

526
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,792
- There you go.
- Thank you, Derek.

527
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,003
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

528
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:43,802
Hmm.

529
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,014
It's not very nice in here.

530
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,183
Oh. No, but...

531
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:54,021
Just wait till you try
the food, 'cause the baklava is divine.

532
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:57,816
Hmm.

533
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:31,016
I have some bad news.

534
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,521
Let's go, lads. Let's go! Come on!

535
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:40,776
And Richmond are ready to start the game
with Colin Hughes in place of Zava.

536
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:43,903
Hughes for Zava. Any thoughts, Chris?

537
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:46,740
Yes. That's the stupidest thing
I've ever seen.

538
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:50,910
<i>And we're off. But where is Zava?</i>

539
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:52,538
Hey. Any news?

540
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,121
Nobody knows where he is.

541
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,957
That fucking prick's not answering
his phone.

542
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:59,043
Neither is his agent, his manager,
his publicist, his trainer,

543
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:03,256
his acupuncturist, his acupressurist,
his fecalist, his avocado whisperer,

544
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:04,549
not even his barber.

545
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,134
Hmm. Maybe he's dead.

546
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:08,428
Fucking better be.

547
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:12,431
<i>Richmond have played
without Zava for ten minutes,</i>

548
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:14,560
<i>and we're all left wondering why.</i>

549
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:18,981
Goodbye, my sweet little stinky friend.

550
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,568
If Shandy asks to borrow an animal again,
please say no.

551
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,278
Oh, sorry, Keeley.

552
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,364
She promised to get a date
with a celebrity.

553
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,116
I've always wanted to come out
of a restaurant and say,

554
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:31,534
"No pictures, please."

555
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:34,538
Edward, gotta love someone
for what they are, not who they are.

556
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:36,248
Mmm.

557
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:39,585
- And here is a giant bag of shit.
- Oh.

558
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,302
Yeah. That's finally starting
to smell better, right?

559
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:51,221
Better? Uh, sure.

560
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:55,017
Now it smells like someone took a dump
directly into a pumpkin spice latte.

561
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:59,478
Oi. I could use a drink actually.
You don't have anything, do you?

562
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,148
Oh, shit. No, sorry.

563
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:03,858
Wait.

564
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:14,035
Shandy's work vodka
finally comes in handy.

565
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:15,995
Nice. Where'd she hide that?

566
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,247
On her desk.

567
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,001
- Yeah.
- You probably want a mixer and ice.

568
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:23,002
Candied oranges?

569
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:24,421
Keeley, you're adorable.

570
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:28,258
But I went to the most prestigious
boarding school in Denmark.

571
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,844
We chugged warm vodka for breakfast.

572
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:35,974
Wow. It takes a lot to surprise me,
and yet you just did.

573
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,351
<i>Skål.</i>

574
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,352
Cheers.

575
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:44,649
I cannot post this.

576
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,027
The little dips look like piles of vomit.

577
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:52,282
I cannot post vomit. People will see this,
and they will want to vomit.

578
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:58,788
Okay. Um, well, the good news is,
it tastes a lot better than it looks.

579
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:05,170
And this pita is, um, freshly made
at the bakery down the road.

580
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,172
Feed it to me.

581
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,801
Okay. Mm-hmm.

582
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:14,888
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mm-hmm.

583
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,099
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

584
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:20,268
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

585
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:26,275
Hmm.

586
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,442
- Nate?
- Yeah?

587
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,863
Can we please leave?
I mean, the food is yummy,

588
00:34:31,864 --> 00:34:33,782
but it's just so dumpy and sad.

589
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:37,369
Okay, look,
I know it might not exactly be cool,

590
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,871
but this place is important to me.

591
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:44,834
This is where my family
celebrated our birthdays, anniversaries.

592
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:47,635
It's where we came after I got promoted
as assistant coach at Richmond.

593
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:52,675
Every important event in our lives
has been spent here.

594
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:55,888
And, to me, that makes this place
even better than cool.

595
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:58,599
Hmm.

596
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,809
Oh, what am I thinking?
We should get the saganaki!

597
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,686
Oh, I'm going to make a call.

598
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,940
My friend has the flu.
And I have to check on her.

599
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,819
No, that's... No, that's very nice.
That's kind.

600
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,322
Do you need all that stuff
to go make a call?

601
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:28,795
All right.

602
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:35,093
Sorry, mate.

603
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:38,847
Still got to charge you for the booze.

604
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,065
<i>And the final score is 4-0</i>

605
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:53,861
<i>as the Richmond Ahabs are still unable
to catch their great blue whale.</i>

606
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:55,905
<i>And without Zava, we're left wondering</i>

607
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:58,491
if this team even belongs
in the Premier League.

608
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:02,203
Well, without Zava, this team
doesn't belong in my church league, Arlo.

609
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:03,829
It's actually a competitive league

610
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,581
- with some very talented clergy.
- Boo!

611
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:08,543
You're all a bunch of fucking wankers!

612
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:11,045
McAdoo, you are shit!

613
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:14,341
Without Zava, you're shit!
Even with Zava, you're shit!

614
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:51,044
Hello, Doctor.

615
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:55,716
Ah, yes. Yes, big loss today.

616
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,429
Mmm. I did. I... I just, uh, saw...
Saw the announcement.

617
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,513
Yes, extraordinary talent.

618
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,642
Sorry, Doctor.
I'm... I'm just in a little bit of a rush.

619
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,729
That would be great. Thank... Thank you.

620
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,155
Ah. Okay.

621
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:23,285
Right. Yes.
That's... That's what I thought.

622
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,831
Oh, it's... it's definitely to be...
Bet... Better to be sure.

623
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,251
Yeah, well, thanks again.

624
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:35,923
Yes. Yes, it was nice to see you
again too.

625
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:39,927
Thank you.

626
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,842
{\an8}What? You actually dated a birthday clown?

627
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:23,345
For three wacky weeks.

628
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:29,350
Did you ever have sex with the clown?
Like, with the nose and everything?

629
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:30,351
Of course I did.

630
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:33,647
It was in his car, actually.

631
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:36,942
All crammed in there with, like,
30 of his clown friends.

632
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:45,534
God. Hearing about all your bozo exes,

633
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,829
making me feel much better
about my last relationship.

634
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,539
- Oh, the footballer, right?
- Yeah.

635
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,457
Yeah. Jamie what's-his-name?

636
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:58,129
No. Well, yeah... No... Um...

637
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,631
The bad breakup?

638
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:04,219
No. It was fun. Five stars.
Would break again.

639
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:09,348
Hmm.

640
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,351
Actually, it was, uh... it was...

641
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,522
No, I'm not gonna go there.
I'm not gonna talk about it.

642
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,441
Because it still hurts.

643
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:21,236
And I'm tired of feeling like that.
I used to be a happy person.

644
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:26,867
- You seem happy to me.
- It's funny.

645
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:29,369
I mean, not like fucking a clown funny.

646
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,958
We spent all evening picking up, like,
50 kilos of lamb ka-poops.

647
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:37,960
It's the most fun I've had in months.

648
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:40,838
Oh, I have way more fun than this,
like, all the time.

649
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,132
Oh, fuck off.

650
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,011
Oi.

651
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,014
Thank you for all of it.

652
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:51,098
You're welcome.

653
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:06,698
Shit. I'm so sorry.
I should not have done that.

654
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,835
No, you absolutely should have.

655
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,768
Baklava for two.

656
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:37,187
Oh, yeah, um...

657
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:41,108
My date had to...

658
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:50,033
Yeah, I'm not gonna be able
to eat all that on my own.

659
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:56,373
Unless you... you'd care to join me.
No. No.

660
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,002
Sure.

661
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,382
After all, our baklava is divine.

662
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:09,303
Yeah, I don't... Um...

663
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,597
For some reason,
whenever I'm trying to impress someone,

664
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:13,891
I end up sounding like my gran.

665
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:15,893
- Your gran?
- Mm-hmm.

666
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:18,937
Um, okay, well...

667
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,441
Take a seat.

668
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:38,873
{\an8}The only modicum of comfort

669
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:41,501
{\an8}is knowing that in all
the innumerable parallel universes,

670
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,128
there is not one where we win that game.

671
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,591
I know what Madchester is.

672
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:06,443
Uh, hey, fellas. It's, uh, Henry.
Do you mind if I...

673
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:08,069
Do your thing.

674
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,154
Thanks.

675
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:16,369
Hey, big guy.

676
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,746
<i>Hi. Sorry about the match.</i>

677
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh, don't worry about that. It happens.
It's good to see you, man.

678
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:26,087
Hey, um, look,
I've been really wanting to talk to you

679
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:28,506
about what happened
at school the other day, you know?

680
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,592
<i>Dad, I messed up.</i>

681
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,055
<i>And if... if I'd just followed your advice,
then none of this would've happened.</i>

682
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:39,225
- What advice?
- <i>"If you're angry, count to ten.</i>

683
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,227
<i>If that don't work, do it again."</i>

684
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:42,354
Yeah.

685
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,868
Well, that's something my dad used to say.

686
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:47,984
Then Nana would tell him
that numbers were infinite

687
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:50,153
just so she could deal with his snoring.

688
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,906
Uh, is Doug all right?

689
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:55,950
<i>I let him know that I was sorry</i>

690
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:58,911
<i>by doing an apology rap
in front of the whole class.</i>

691
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,204
Huh.

692
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:03,457
Well, you know, a hip-hop song's
a great way to get across a message.

693
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,253
You know? Just look
at the hip-hop song "The Message."

694
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:11,550
Hey, guys. Good effort today.

695
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:15,304
Mr. Higgins, is it true about Zava?

696
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:17,472
I'm afraid so.

697
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,103
Maybe some tissues for Dani.

698
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:27,107
Hey, hey, guys. Zava just posted a video.

699
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:37,284
<i>Hello. How are you? I'm just... I have
to share something with you, my friends.</i>

700
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,662
<i>You are not my followers.
You are my believers.</i>

701
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:44,208
<i>And so it... I have to tell you.</i>

702
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,336
<i>Zava has played his last match.</i>

703
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:52,590
<i>I will now dedicate all of my time
and all of my energy</i>

704
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:55,886
<i>to my family and my avocado farm.</i>

705
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,932
<i>If you put your energy
into the things you truly love,</i>

706
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:05,103
<i>the universe puts its thing back into you.
You're welcome.</i>

707
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,107
Um, hey, buddy.

708
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:11,943
I gotta go talk
to the team here real quick.

709
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:14,111
But then I'm gonna grab my stuff
and scurry home.

710
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:16,948
And how about we hop online,
play a little <i>Roblox</i>? How does that sound?

711
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:19,617
<i>You're on. Love you, Dad.</i>

712
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:22,120
I love you too, buddy. I'm proud of you.

713
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:42,599
He's okay. He's okay.

714
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:47,521
He's okay. He's okay.

715
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,072
Hmm.

716
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:03,912
Gentlemen, hey.

717
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:06,664
That was a tough one tonight. Okay?

718
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:09,959
Man City has still got our number.
That... That's all right.

719
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,796
We're gonna get another crack at 'em
later in the season. Uh-huh.

720
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:15,298
Coach, no practice tomorrow, yeah?

721
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:18,260
- That's right.
- Okay. Well, I'll see y'all on Monday.

722
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,263
Hey, hey. Hey, Coach.

723
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:23,515
What about Zava?

724
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,309
Um...

725
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:26,977
He quit the team.

726
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:30,646
I mean, technically
he retired from the whole sport,

727
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,900
which makes it feel
a little less personal, yeah?

728
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,901
You know, like if, uh,

729
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:37,820
your girlfriend runs off with some dude
and it turns out they were soul mates.

730
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,030
Oh. Yeah.

731
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:40,573
Gina fucking Gershon.

732
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:41,658
Right.

733
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:45,786
Uh, but look, look, look, look.
I hear you, okay? Zava is gone.

734
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:48,290
And you know what?
I think it's a good thing.

735
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:52,960
- What? How?
- Well, I do. Okay, look.

736
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:54,962
Do I wanna win? Heck yeah.

737
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:58,175
But I also wanna do it
with folks that wanna be here.

738
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:03,679
It's not like we could handcuff him
to his locker and make him love us.

739
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,806
We could have tried.

740
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:09,060
Hey, guys. Guys, look.
We got a good thing going here.

741
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:10,562
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

742
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:13,982
We didn't need Zava. Yeah?

743
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,861
Yeah.

744
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:23,116
All we need to win
are the fellas in this room right now.

745
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:27,037
And all you fellas need to do
is believe it.

746
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,541
- Whoa!
- It's a sign.

747
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:33,835
That's it. We're doomed.

748
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:36,587
We're done. We're done.
We're finished. We're finished.

749
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:38,047
Now... Now, hold on.

750
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:41,133
Hey, knock it off, okay?
We're not doomed. No one is doomed.

751
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:46,098
But, Bumbercatch, yes, you're right.
It is a sign. I agree. Yeah.

752
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:53,272
In fact this, it's just a sign.

753
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:56,316
All right, guys, listen to me.

754
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:59,876
Belief doesn't just happen
'cause you hang something up on a wall.

755
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:03,281
All right? It comes from in here.

756
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:05,868
You know? And up here. Down here.

757
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,746
Only problem is, we all got
so much junk floating through us,

758
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:13,041
a lot of time
we end up getting in our own way.

759
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,883
You know, crap like envy or fear, shame.

760
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:28,223
I don't wanna mess around
with that shit anymore.

761
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:30,725
You know what I mean? Do you?

762
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:31,976
- No.
- No, Coach.

763
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:33,270
- No.
- No.

764
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:36,898
- Do you?
- No.

765
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,401
No, me neither. Hell no.

766
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:42,112
Well, you know
what I wanna mess around with?

767
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:48,577
<i>The belief that I matter, you know?
Regardless of what I do or don't achieve.</i>

768
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:53,581
<i>Or the belief
that we all deserve to be loved,</i>

769
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:58,128
whether we've been hurt
or maybe we've hurt somebody else.

770
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:04,468
<i>Or what about the belief of hope? Yeah?
That's what I wanna mess with.</i>

771
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:09,180
Believing that things can get better.

772
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:13,143
That I can get better.
That we will get better.

773
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,609
Oh, man. To believe in yourself.
To believe in one another.

774
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:25,072
Man, that's...
That's fundamental to being alive.

775
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:31,495
And look. Yo, hey. If you can do that,
if each of you can truly do that...

776
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,545
can't nobody rip that apart.

777
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:49,470
- See y'all Monday?
- Yes, Coach.

778
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:50,806
Thank you.

779
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,814
- Tomorrow at 4:00 a.m.?
- Damn fucking right.
