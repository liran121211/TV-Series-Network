1
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,313
Man, we can't even get a goal
for an exhibition match.

2
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,397
Friendly.

3
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,233
Ain't nothing friendly
about what happened out here.

4
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,069
They call exhibition matches friendlies.

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,281
Man, this sport drives me nuts.

6
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,245
Rebecca. My apologies.

7
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:41,375
Now, you've come all the way to Amsterdam,
and we at Ajax have been such rude hosts.

8
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:46,839
Marjolein, you've been more than gracious.
Especially given the circumstances.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,761
There we are.

10
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,814
Till next time.

11
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,690
Thank you.

12
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,193
Truly was an honor to play here
at the Johan Croyff Arena.

13
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:15,284
No. The honor is ours completely.
But it is pronounced Johan Cruijff.

14
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,451
Still.

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,627
God, this song's depressing.

16
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,214
Would you agree that

17
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,383
this has been
an extremely demoralizing result?

18
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,886
But, luckily our spirits
were already broken.

19
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:40,433
Yeah. And so, Roy Kent, don't you think
Richmond's objectively poor performance

20
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,270
is due to the fact that you're nothing
without Zava?

21
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,524
Who cares? It's a fucking friendly.
A friendly is a pretend match.

22
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,401
This is a pretend conversation.

23
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,695
You're a pretend person
with a pretend job.

24
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,489
And I'm having a really hard time
pretending to give a shit.

25
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,490
Wow.

26
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,159
Right.

27
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,369
Jan...

28
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,122
- Hi. Thanks.
- Hi. Love the pink.

29
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,668
Okay, a night out in Amsterdam it is.

30
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,255
Let's make the best of it.
What's the plan?

31
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,798
I'm spoken for, I'm afraid.

32
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,675
It's my first time in Amsterdam,

33
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,347
and I have a date with someone special
in the red-light district.

34
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,395
Nah.

35
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,233
- Just you and me then, kid.
- I'd love to...

36
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,485
- That's a quick cancellation.
- How'd you know I was gonna cancel?

37
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,695
Because there's a certain note
in your vocal range

38
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,114
that you only ever hit
when you're being preemptively apologetic.

39
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,450
- Come on. Out with it.
- All right.

40
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:44,247
Apparently,
tonight is the best aurora borealis ever.

41
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,835
Like, it's the aurora "boreal-iest."
In Norway.

42
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,256
And Jack and her plane are waiting
for me at the airport right now.

43
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:53,966
Subtle.

44
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,009
And amazing.

45
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:58,720
Go.

46
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,931
- I promise I'll make it up to you.
- Yes, you will.

47
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,100
Great job, Jan.

48
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,270
And, Roy, thank you again for doing this.

49
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,398
Yeah. Anytime.

50
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,317
- I love you.
- I love you.

51
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,451
- Where's she going?
- Somewhere that believes they deserve her.

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Hey, there he is.

53
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,736
- Someone's in a mood.
- Yeah.

54
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,616
- Wait.
- Actually...

55
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,712
What do you think?

56
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,673
Think only you can get these guys out
of their pineapple percussions.

57
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,845
Doldrums. Nice.

58
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,255
Yeah, I'm gonna say something.

59
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,225
Hey, fellas.

60
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:31,812
I'm about to say three words no coach
ever says unless he dang well means it.

61
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,648
- "You're all shit."
- No.

62
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,608
- "Knowledge is power"?
- True, but no.

63
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,276
- "Live, laugh, love."
- No.

64
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,155
Correct answer is: "No curfew tonight."

65
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,532
- What?
- That's right.

66
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,200
I don't wanna see your pretty faces

67
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,244
until we get back on this bus
at what time, Coach?

68
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,370
10:00 a.m., baby!

69
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,164
You heard the man. 10:00 a.m.

70
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,710
All right, let's be careful out there.
<i>Hill Street Blues</i>.

71
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,296
Smart move, Coach.

72
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,174
Yeah. Well, you know, they need it.

73
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,093
Not as bad as you do.

74
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,806
No curfew in Amsterdam, boys!

75
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,891
Should we all take naps
so we can stay up later?

76
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,726
No. We push through,

77
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,520
and we all meet
in the lobby five o'clock sharp.

78
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,814
Yeah!

79
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,525
Tonight is gonna be mad, you know!

80
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,652
Not for you, Tartt!

81
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,237
Let's go.

82
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,155
You serious?

83
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,200
You're not on fucking holiday
from training.

84
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,953
What about my stuff?

85
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,663
Right.

86
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,250
Throw this away, please.

87
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,170
Let's go!

88
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:38,755
Great. Sick. You have fun.

89
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,133
Gonna see the sights. Training. Amsterdam.

90
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,969
- Don't actually throw that away, yeah?
- Okay.

91
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,554
Hey. Wait up, Coach!

92
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,182
Getting off the coach, Coach.

93
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,017
Run!

94
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,149
This is gonna be so good.

95
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,652
Hey. How about you roll with me tonight?

96
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,029
That'd be wonderful. Thank you.

97
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:08,660
Yeah. Great.
Our first stop: the red-light district.

98
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:44,404
Did you know Amsterdam's origins
date back to the 13th century?

99
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,491
That's mad, innit?

100
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,577
Coach, this way.

101
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:59,336
This is the world-famous Skinny Bridge!

102
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,004
Yeah?

103
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:05,424
As seen in major motion picture,
James Bond's <i>Diamonds Are Forever.</i>

104
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,177
Stop with all the fucking
sightseeing shit, you twat.

105
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,264
Right.
Next stop, Amsterdam's thinnest house.

106
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:15,769
It's gonna blow your mind, lad.
Come on. Get moving, lad.

107
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:27,071
{\an8}Hello.

108
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,489
{\an8}<i>Stinky, what's wrong?</i>

109
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,242
{\an8}- Nothing. Why?
<i>- Bullshit!</i>

110
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:34,537
{\an8}<i>I felt warm in my belly,
so there must be a problem. Out with it.</i>

111
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,081
{\an8}Sass, you know,
you're actually wrong this time.

112
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,292
{\an8}<i>I am never wrong.</i>

113
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,168
{\an8}Jesus.

114
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,086
{\an8}<i>What are all those bells?</i>

115
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,421
{\an8}<i>Are you in a casino?</i>

116
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:49,011
No. I'm actually just out
having a stroll in Amsterdam on my own.

117
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,893
Completely unburdened.
I haven't even got my bag with me.

118
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,063
<i>Oh, right. Amsterdam.
I forgot. Jealous.</i>

119
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,399
<i>Well, eat a space cake for me
and call me when you freak out.</i>

120
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,527
- I love you.
<i>- Buh-buh-bye.</i>

121
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,534
- Yeah.
- Yes?

122
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,494
I saw you walking just there,
and I thought,

123
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,706
"I have to say something
to this beautiful woman."

124
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,835
Right. What exactly were you...

125
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,129
Oh, my God. Oh, my! Go...

126
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,090
Shit.

127
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,260
Oh, my God!

128
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,346
Are you hurt?

129
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,557
No. I'm okay.

130
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,142
- It's just very cold.
- Come on.

131
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,645
Sorry, did you see where my phone went?

132
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,772
Who cares? You're alive. Come on.

133
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:46,318
Yeah. Yes. Okay. It's my phone, so...

134
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,159
Fair enough.

135
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,245
Come. You need to get warm.

136
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,498
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

137
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,835
You're walking on the bike lane.

138
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,087
I mean,
how the fuck am I supposed to know that?

139
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,673
Stupid fucking place.

140
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,465
Come on.

141
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,844
Like, remember when Jordan
wouldn't wear Reebok in the '92 Olympics?

142
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:13,804
Of course.

143
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:16,514
{\an8}'74 World Cup,
Cruyff refuses to wear Adidas,

144
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,393
{\an8}they gotta make him a special
two-striped shirt. He was a badass.

145
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,811
But he was also a paragon of the '60s,

146
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,980
so he was bigger than Jordan, really.

147
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,275
He was like Jordan
and John Lennon combined.

148
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,900
That's cool.

149
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,571
- You pick a place to eat yet?
- Oh, shoot. No, I forgot.

150
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,154
On it.

151
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,156
Let's see.

152
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,662
{\an8}Hey! This could be good.
Yankee Doodle Burger Barn.

153
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:44,625
"An authentic American dining experience
with American-sized portions."

154
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,003
You know, I could definitely go
for a little taste of home.

155
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,548
- How's that sound, Coach?
- What's it rated?

156
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,133
2.7.

157
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,260
Out of five.

158
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,053
Think we can beat that.

159
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,055
All right.

160
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,730
I don't know what's going
on with me, Coach.

161
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,400
It's like I'm feeling stuck
or something, you know?

162
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,029
I need to do something
to help me get me out of my head.

163
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,449
Like get punched in the face or

164
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,244
drink a couple of bottles of red wine
and yell at my mom.

165
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,664
You know, just...
I wanna try something new.

166
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,541
Help me get inspired.

167
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,088
I've been waiting for you
to say those words for a very long time.

168
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,854
We should have took a train
to Paris a long time ago.

169
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,272
Would any of you gentlemen care
for some drinks?

170
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,357
Leffe Blond.

171
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,401
- I'll have a beer and a shot of te...
- No!

172
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,819
We're about to head out, but thank you.

173
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,905
No worries.

174
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,281
Okay. Yeah. That's everyone.

175
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,201
So, what's the plan for the night then,
Captain?

176
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,328
I'm taking all your suggestions.

177
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,582
For me, the best option for a night
in Amsterdam is a train to Paris.

178
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,544
I told you...
I'm gonna say it again. I am not kidding.

179
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,588
You know, my father actually suggested
we take a boat tour through the canal.

180
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,007
- Yeah. Great way to see the city.
- We're near The Hague.

181
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,093
We can go
to the International Court of Justice.

182
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,263
Poke around. Ask some questions.

183
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,639
I would like to see a tulip.

184
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,392
- You mean tulip fields?
- No. Just one tulip.

185
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,853
An entire field
will be incredibly overwhelming.

186
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:30,691
Wait. Y'all are joking, right?
We gotta go to a live sex show.

187
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,609
Very cultural, Thierry.

188
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,779
Yo, Trent! What should we do?

189
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,199
Well,
the city has a wonderful museum culture.

190
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,994
In fact, tonight is what's known
as <i>Museumnacht</i>,

191
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,621
where they stay open till quite late.

192
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,666
I didn't come to Amsterdam
to learn things.

193
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,959
Yeah.

194
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,670
- Sorry, Trent.
- Great shot though.

195
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,005
I don't know. The city does seem lovely,

196
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,465
but maybe it would just be easier
if all of us stayed in

197
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,510
and enjoyed a nice team movie night.

198
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,889
Sam, come on.

199
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,807
Hey, boys. Have fun tonight.

200
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,226
Higgins. Where you going?

201
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,147
Tonight's the night young William here
becomes a man.

202
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,316
Cheers.

203
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,614
Nah.

204
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,991
Jan Maas, we're on your home turf.
What you got for us?

205
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,451
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Good point. Let's go.

206
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,532
Okay, tourists, thank you for getting
all those terrible ideas out of the way.

207
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:31,584
Now listen, my cousin, Martin Garrix,
is deejaying

208
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,961
- at a private all-night party.
- I guess it's his cousin.

209
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,048
We're talking drinking,
dancing and women into the morning,

210
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,052
which is when they'll be serving
a hearty breakfast.

211
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,765
Hey, guys, I'm sorry. Sorry.
I think I need to bow out.

212
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:49,019
Yeah. I ate some pickled herring earlier,
and now my stomach's bothering me.

213
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:53,231
- You're gonna miss the live sex show, bro.
- You mean the party.

214
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,150
I cannot wait
to hear all the dirty details.

215
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:56,943
Good luck, gents.

216
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:57,985
- See you later.
- All right.

217
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:58,987
All right, broski.

218
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,322
Hydrate!

219
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,909
Right. So it seems like
this private party is the obvious answer?

220
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,410
- Yep.
- Okay, great.

221
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,205
We just gotta take the bus to Groningen,
which is only a two-hour drive.

222
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,123
Two hours?

223
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,166
- It breezes over.
- Two.

224
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,209
You will love it.

225
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,629
Hey, amigos. Why don't we just split up?

226
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:17,880
The tulips with me!

227
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,133
No! Overruled.

228
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,637
We pick one place, and we go as a team.

229
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,557
Excuse me.
I think we're gonna order them drinks now.

230
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:31,103
And can you bring me
a giant stack of napkins? Thanks.

231
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,521
Voting time.

232
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,898
- Dude, a sex show is funny.
- We're not going to a sex show.

233
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,986
I really want the tulip experience
that everyone talks about.

234
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:46,034
Actually surprisingly good water pressure
for a boat.

235
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,038
Hello?

236
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,220
Oh, shit.

237
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:12,769
Hello?

238
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,085
Hello?

239
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,807
Fuck me.

240
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,978
Right down there's the bench
from <i>Fault in Our Stars</i>!

241
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,399
The movie!

242
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,110
Tourist!

243
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,322
So, red-light district.

244
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,618
- That's right.
- Cool. Okay. Awesome.

245
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,951
- Is everything all right at home or...
- Here we are.

246
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,459
His name was Chet Baker.

247
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,716
{\an8}American, gifted trumpeter,
unique singer and a heroin addict.

248
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,801
He was tortured by demons,

249
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,847
but they didn't stop him
from making beautiful music.

250
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,435
He's what got me into jazz
in the first place, you know.

251
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,229
You hear his story and you think,

252
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,857
"There's nothing more punk rock
than that."

253
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:26,278
Then, on the 13th of May, 1988,

254
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,156
he passed away on this very spot.

255
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,909
Wow. How was it he died?

256
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:36,455
He fell from that window up there.

257
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,542
But was it an accident?
Did he jump, or was he pushed?

258
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,296
And we're gonna solve
that mystery tonight.

259
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,510
{\an8}No. We're just here
to pay our respects to a legend.

260
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,929
{\an8}What led to his death?
We don't know, Will.

261
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,182
- We only know this: drugs are bad.
- Yes.

262
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,893
- No, they are.
- Yeah.

263
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,980
My man, Kenneth the bus driver,
hooked me up a couple of weeks ago.

264
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,190
Wait, so you travel with it?

265
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,982
I thought they had plenty
of that stuff here.

266
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,195
Well, I just don't like my medicine
to be taxed.

267
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:12,823
I don't know, Coach.

268
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:17,411
You know, I've always been more
of a beer man or Sour Patch Kids.

269
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:21,583
Sour Patch Kids don't form literal
new pathways in your brain.

270
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,420
Picture a sheet of fresh,
white snow covering all the footsteps

271
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,257
of all the paths that you've trod before,

272
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:34,346
forcing you...
Nay, encouraging you... to begin anew.

273
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,181
And how's it taste?

274
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:41,602
Disgusting, so most people put it
in peanut butter and jelly or yogurt.

275
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,271
Uh-huh. And which one we doing?

276
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,775
Neither. We're doing tea.

277
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,361
Oh, come on, man. Are you kidding me?

278
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:54,741
That's like hiding poop
inside a smoothie of barf.

279
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,703
I don't say this often enough

280
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:02,165
because I generally think it's implied,
but trust me.

281
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:10,299
This is how you change your mind.

282
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,444
I can't do it, Coach. I'm sorry.

283
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:34,615
Oh, boy.

284
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,118
Did you have any?

285
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,253
- Where we at?
- We have nine votes for sex show.

286
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,090
Nine votes for private party.

287
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,010
And one vote for tulip.

288
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:02,892
That leaves us with two.
Sex show versus private party.

289
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:06,396
And I think someone picked tulip, yes?
But who?

290
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,900
Dani, you wrote it in Spanish.

291
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,737
Someone wrote it in Spanish, yes.

292
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:20,409
Look, it doesn't matter what we choose.
This has to be unanimous. Discuss.

293
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,203
Okay, the idea of seeing a sex show

294
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,831
is one that makes me more uncomfortable
than aroused.

295
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:26,749
Right? Right.

296
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,795
Which is why I'm still in favor of,
you know, a nice, simple movie night.

297
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,715
But as I said earlier,

298
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,844
Jan's admittedly inconvenient plan
is an excellent second option.

299
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:41,556
Yeah? Yes? Okay.
Great. All right. Let's go.

300
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,724
Wh... No. Guys. Stick with me.

301
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,979
We're two hours away from that party.

302
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:53,193
But we're only ten minutes away
from watching some sex. Come on.

303
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,279
Things flying about...

304
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,284
Can you please tell my friend
that he is being a boring tourist?

305
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:04,162
- What is your name?
- Everybody calls me Van Damme.

306
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:13,880
Okay, Van Damme, would you prefer to pay
to watch two tired people have sex

307
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:18,051
or rather go to a party
where perhaps you could get some yourself?

308
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,428
They're tired?

309
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,014
Exhausted.

310
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,605
We can finally start our night
in Amsterdam!

311
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,148
In Groningen, yes!

312
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,359
No, wait. We need to eat first, right?

313
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,029
Yes. Definitely.
Okay. What do you want to eat?

314
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,363
- Ramen.
- Shawarma!

315
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,907
No way. We haven't eaten...

316
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,948
Some brownies with marijuana.
Or maybe some Mexican?

317
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,224
- Hello?
- It's me. Is it okay to come in?

318
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:10,521
Yeah, of course. It's your house... boat.

319
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,230
Hi.

320
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,275
You really didn't need to leave.

321
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:20,155
No, but taking a shower on a stranger's
boat is uncomfortable enough.

322
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:24,952
And you shouldn't be worried that
he's watching you through some peephole.

323
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,828
- Peephole?
- Yeah.

324
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,706
Someone's dated themselves.

325
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:35,420
Had you down as more of a webcam kind
of guy... Anyway, thank you, nonetheless.

326
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,046
You're bleeding.

327
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,715
- I'm what?
- You're bleeding.

328
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,342
What?

329
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:44,012
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, don't worry. Take a seat.

330
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:47,808
I don't even know how that happened.

331
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,270
I was in the military.

332
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,355
I trained for this.

333
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,025
And I don't want blood on my floor.

334
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,570
- Hey?
- Yep.

335
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,992
You got strong ankles.

336
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:09,162
Yes. I wear a lot of high heels for work.

337
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,790
All right. There you go.

338
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,214
Sorry. Force of habit.

339
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,091
It's all that military training.

340
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,433
And the tea was really lovely. Thank you.

341
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:32,644
Would it perhaps be more lovely
if we added some brandy?

342
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:40,610
No. I'm just going to wait
till my clothes have dried

343
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:42,696
and then I'll pop off.

344
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:48,285
In two hours and 40 minutes.

345
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,620
Okay.

346
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,166
If you don't wanna wait, I can call a cab
for you and your bag of wet clothes,

347
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,627
or I can make dinner.

348
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:02,173
Well, yes, I am quite hungry actually.

349
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:08,513
And wet clothes are rather heavy
in a bag, so... yes.

350
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:11,098
Fuck it. That'd be nice.

351
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,436
- Good! <i>Gezellig</i>?
- Yep.

352
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,396
Wait.

353
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,488
Feel free to change into one of these.

354
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:39,877
Should I be concerned that you've got
a giant Tupperware box of women's clothing

355
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:42,339
in your floating house?

356
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,799
These aren't trophies, are they?

357
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,263
No. It's my former partner.
She was tall, like you.

358
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,307
I'm sorry. Did she pass away?

359
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:56,812
Unfortunately, no.

360
00:23:58,397 --> 00:23:59,481
Please help yourself.

361
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:06,320
I... Look, I don't really think I can
borrow your ex... God, this is lovely.

362
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:09,491
Please, change.
We'll eat, and then you'll go, all right?

363
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,493
Yeah. Sure.

364
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:15,079
And after dinner
I can give you a foot massage.

365
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,164
Absolutely not.

366
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,835
Are you sure? My technique is sound.

367
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:23,255
I'm sure it is, but I will pass.

368
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:29,511
Okay, then. Fine. Stand there
with tired feet, completely sober.

369
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:32,723
It does not affect me at all.

370
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,355
Fine. Come on, then. I'll have a bit.

371
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,072
<i>Gezellig.</i>

372
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:55,329
They put a dam on the river Amstel.
"Amsteldam."

373
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:59,207
Amsterdam. It's good, innit?

374
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:02,794
- Come on.
- Fucking stop for a fucking second!

375
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:04,922
Please.

376
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,967
God.

377
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,805
How do you know so much about here?

378
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:16,390
It's Amsterdam. How do you not?

379
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:17,725
Never been here in my life.

380
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,229
- What? Never?
- No.

381
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,813
- Not one stag party?
- No.

382
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,732
- Not one international match?
- No.

383
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:27,151
Not one emergency flight diverted here

384
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:28,903
because some EasyJet passenger
was being a prick?

385
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,571
- That never happens.
- It does.

386
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:34,826
It does happen, if you're being enough
of a prick. Which I was.

387
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,787
It just looks like
a Disney version of an old city.

388
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,413
It all looks so fucking fake.

389
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:40,582
It's not fake.

390
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:44,336
Come on. Windmills? Fake.

391
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,422
I ain't even from here, and I'm offended.

392
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,258
Windmills are real, man.
What are you talking about?

393
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:51,718
Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.

394
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:56,974
We need bikes.

395
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,852
What? No.

396
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:24,305
- You know, Coach, if you wanna go...
- I'll see you in the morning.

397
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:57,743
Hey.

398
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,619
Hi. Can I help you?

399
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,996
Have you got vanilla vodka?

400
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:02,789
Dear God, no.

401
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,542
A beer, please. Thank you.

402
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,342
- There you go, sweetie.
- Thanks.

403
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:17,679
Hey, can I ask, do you know who I am?

404
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:20,557
Can I tell you a secret?

405
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:24,478
Tonight, you're whoever you want to be.

406
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:26,480
Yeah.

407
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:28,898
You should stick around for the party
later on. Thunderdong.

408
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:30,483
Good vibes, good place to make friends.

409
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:31,652
Sounds fun, I'm in.

410
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:33,529
Trent! Hey.

411
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:37,658
Can I get a drink
for my work acquaintance, please?

412
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,702
Sorry, did you say Thunderdong?

413
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:47,084
I think I'm in the wrong place.
My mistake. Cheers.

414
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,295
Happens all the time.

415
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:51,879
Yeah.

416
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,802
- Colin!
- Good to see you, Trent.

417
00:27:57,594 --> 00:28:00,430
Colin. I already knew.

418
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,812
I've known for months.
I haven't said anything to anyone.

419
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:12,276
I must have a good reason for that,
mustn't I?

420
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,319
Right.

421
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:06,747
Your ex has wonderful taste.

422
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,833
Well, actually, she hated that one.

423
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,712
Yeah, of course she did.
I bought it for her.

424
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,054
Hey. <i>Gezellig</i>, right?

425
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:28,852
That smells wonderful.

426
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:30,687
It's almost ready.

427
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,318
Would you like a drink?

428
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,988
- I would love one.
- Please, help yourself.

429
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:50,623
So, should I be worried about some
giant Dutch woman wandering on here

430
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,250
and strangling me for wearing her clothes?

431
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:53,293
No.

432
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:57,797
Things are over between us, and have been
so for some time. So don't worry.

433
00:29:57,798 --> 00:29:59,591
It's all right. I didn't mean to...

434
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:01,759
You don't need to tell me
any of the details.

435
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,053
She was unfaithful.

436
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:05,972
I loved her very much, so it wrecked me,

437
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:09,768
and I came dangerously
close to destroying our family on it.

438
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:14,063
But then, with time,

439
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:19,278
I realized that this thing didn't happen
to me, it happened for me. You know?

440
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,120
Cheers.

441
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:29,788
<i>Proost.</i>

442
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:32,081
- Proost. Prost.
- <i>Proost.</i>

443
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,417
Proust.

444
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:42,800
Wait, is this some Dutch bloke singing
"She Believes in Me" by Kenny Rogers?

445
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:47,096
Whoa.
This Dutch bloke is the great André Hazes,

446
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,516
and he's singing "Zij Gelooft in Mij,"
all right?

447
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:51,143
Okay.

448
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,479
And yes, the Gambling Man did it first.
But...

449
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:14,498
<i>And who knows
Maybe on some special night</i>

450
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,793
<i>If my song is right</i>

451
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:22,382
<i>I will find a way</i>

452
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,985
- The fuck are you doing?
- Just be patient.

453
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:44,196
Bicycle?

454
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:46,656
Thank you. Two, please.

455
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,867
I love a challenge. Hold this.

456
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,788
Mate. We've just made tonight amazing.

457
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,665
I don't wanna ride around
on a fucking bike.

458
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,251
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

459
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:01,547
- Voilà. Sixty euros.
- Have a hundred.

460
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,130
Thank you.

461
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,423
- Here.
- Get it away from me.

462
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,008
- Oh, come on.
- No, I don't want it.

463
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,802
Mate,
we take the bikes, we find a windmill.

464
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:09,428
- No. I said no.
- Why the fuck not?

465
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,181
I don't know how to ride a bike!

466
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:27,614
No refunds.

467
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,160
Fucking hell, Roy.
Do you know how to tie your own laces?

468
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,580
Stop being a dick.

469
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,416
When I went to Sunderland,

470
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:41,335
my granddad told me he'd teach me how
to ride when I came back for Christmas,

471
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,881
and then he fucking died,
and I haven't been on a bike since.

472
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,466
And now I'm saying that out loud,

473
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:50,261
I realize that never learning was actually
a great disrespect to his memory

474
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,305
and now I feel ashamed.
So can we stop talking about it

475
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,807
and go back to me just taking out
my negative emotions on you,

476
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,435
even if you deserve it or not?

477
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:07,196
Go on, Roy. For Granddad.

478
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:14,703
Fuck.

479
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:22,211
Okay,
you're gonna sit up, look up and pedal.

480
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,132
Straight back up. Just straight back up.

481
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:31,678
Put your feet on the pedals.
Put your feet on the pedals.

482
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,430
That's it, good. Now pedal.

483
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,224
Put your foot on the ped...

484
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,810
All right. Okay. All right.

485
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,772
On the bike. Okay. There you go.

486
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,649
Pick it up but in an angry way, man.

487
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:50,571
Good lad. Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.
That's it. Hey!

488
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:53,115
Good lad, pedal it. You actually...
That's it, that's it!

489
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:54,408
That's good! That's good.

490
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:56,744
You did it for two seconds there, man.
That's an improvement.

491
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,829
Steady on, mate. Steady on.

492
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,792
Hey! What... You're doing well, man.
Calm down.

493
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,919
How's that gonna help anyone?

494
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,338
In there. There you go. Good.

495
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,756
- I can't turn the other way.
- Yes. All right. This way.

496
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:11,384
- I can't turn the other way.
- It's right. Follow me.

497
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:12,718
- Try and hit me!
- I can't turn.

498
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,263
It's all about balance, man.
Just like dribbling.

499
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,265
If you can dribble, you can balance.
That's it.

500
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:18,599
Yeah, that's good. You do...

501
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,434
- All right, mate. It's good...
- I'm gonna kill you.

502
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:22,727
- You're doing it.
- I'm doing it.

503
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,774
Let's go find a fucking windmill!

504
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:29,945
For Granddad! All right, wait for me.

505
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:42,916
We're sitting here?

506
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:46,002
Well, yeah.
You know, you said pick good seats, so...

507
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:50,047
Yeah, but these are so exposed.

508
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:55,846
Oh, no. It's like the time I was
front and center at an improv comedy show.

509
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,869
Are they gonna make a song
about how I look like an altar boy?

510
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,725
It's okay. You did great.

511
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:02,477
- Here's your drink.
- Thank you.

512
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,718
Thank you for doing this, Will.

513
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,356
One pilgrim alone is merely a zealot,

514
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:10,777
but two pilgrims together,
that's a pilgrimage.

515
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:13,738
Cheers.

516
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:15,448
Here we go.

517
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:25,792
Welcome to Jazz Café Alto. My name is
Dante Charles, and we are the Kartel.

518
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,425
- Miles Davis once said that...
- Yeah.

519
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:37,095
<i>Remember the night</i>

520
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:40,641
And that was the second time
I came out to her.

521
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,685
This time, however, she believed me.

522
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:49,273
And now... we're closer than ever.

523
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:50,359
And your daughter?

524
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:52,903
Yeah. She's never been happier.

525
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:58,700
My point is,

526
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:02,037
it was really difficult
to hold on to that secret.

527
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:04,456
But I'm not a professional athlete.

528
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,042
How do you do it?

529
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:15,342
Well... my whole life is two lives really.

530
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:18,595
You got my work life.

531
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,682
Like, no one at the club knows.

532
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:27,479
I'd like to think they wouldn't care,
but it's just easier that way.

533
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:30,816
Then you got my dating life.

534
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,527
Some guys think it's hot.

535
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:39,825
Others say they don't care, but eventually
they get tired and they move on.

536
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:43,704
Then the club brought in Dr. Sharon...

537
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,041
and she helped me realize that I have...

538
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:51,545
an ache.

539
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:59,011
An ache for both my lives
to be my only life.

540
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:03,974
I don't want to be a spokesperson.

541
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:07,352
I don't want a bunch of apologies.

542
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:15,777
All I want is for when we win a match,

543
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:22,868
to be able to kiss my fella the same way
the guys get to kiss their girls.

544
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,001
And I know we can't fix
every ache inside of us.

545
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,340
But I shouldn't have
to pretend it's not there either.

546
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,810
How'd you know? About me?

547
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:53,649
Well, I used my Holmesian
powers of journalistic deduction.

548
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,321
Saw you kissing a guy
outside Sam's restaurant.

549
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:02,991
Yeah.

550
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,120
Those are the bells of the Westerkerk.

551
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,293
Anne Frank heard
those same bells every night.

552
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:15,754
She lived just there.

553
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,924
Right by this big, pink triangle?

554
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:21,969
Think that came a bit later.

555
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,471
Oh, yeah.

556
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,765
"One doesn't expect to get from life

557
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:12,477
what one has already learned
it cannot give,

558
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:19,067
rather, one begins to see
that life is a kind of sowing time...

559
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,905
and the harvest is not yet here."

560
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:27,618
He was just a humble preacher's son.

561
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:34,458
And yes, he had his demons, but they never
stopped him from searching for beauty.

562
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,632
Because when you find beauty,
you find inspiration.

563
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,013
If, that is,
you stay as determined as Vincent.

564
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:53,227
Never stop, no matter how many failures.

565
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:59,107
When you know you're doing
what you're meant to do, you have to try.

566
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:05,906
Where I'm from...

567
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:12,788
Kansas, my home...
This here, this is our state flower.

568
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,543
I want you to have this.

569
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,339
We close in three minutes.

570
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,341
Mercy buckets.

571
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:26,552
Yep.

572
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:41,899
We are in Holland!
We should try Dutch food!

573
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,361
- As a Frenchman, I would rather die!
- No!

574
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,741
Enough!

575
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:54,496
We are riven by this crossroads!

576
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,083
Is this it?

577
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:04,715
Should we huddle around the laptop
for a movie night?

578
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,635
How else do we proceed?

579
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:13,432
How doth we channel
this lack of compromise?

580
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:18,812
This dissension? This rage?

581
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:21,607
Captain.

582
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:50,176
Coach. I know that you have
my best interests at heart,

583
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:52,011
or the club's anyway.

584
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:53,846
Even though you're clearly upset
about something else

585
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,098
and you're taking it out on me.

586
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:59,686
What I'm trying to say is,
I'm sorry for being a dick earlier.

587
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,566
I've been to Amsterdam twice.

588
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:08,444
When I was 14, me dad
was trying to get back with me mum,

589
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:12,157
and he was acting like some kind of
fucking super dad or some shit,

590
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:15,410
and he brought me out here
for some father-son bonding time.

591
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:19,539
Anyway, he said it was
to watch a football match.

592
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,085
After the game, he took me to the
red-light district for my real present.

593
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:30,467
He took me to lose my virginity
to those ladies behind the windows.

594
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:34,179
Jesus. Must have been traumatizing.

595
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,348
No. She loved it.

596
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,852
For me... Sorry, me, you mean.

597
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:42,478
No.

598
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:43,897
I don't know.

599
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:45,816
I don't remember.

600
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:51,404
Anyway, a couple of years later,
me mum brought me back here.

601
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:55,241
And we went to museums
and did all the tours,

602
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:59,621
and it's the first time I had <i>stroopwafel</i>.
Never forget that time.

603
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:06,003
Even though my dad weren't here, he was
still kinda there with us. You know?

604
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,926
I was a dick today too. I'm sorry.

605
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:18,974
I think Keeley's got a girlfriend.

606
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:25,814
Let's go find us some windmills, eh?

607
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:28,692
Yeah.

608
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:43,456
Bang.

609
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:49,755
Howdy, partner.

610
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:51,173
Hey there.

611
00:43:51,174 --> 00:43:53,508
Welcome to Yankee Doodle Burger Barn.
Table for one?

612
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:56,427
Wh... Yes, please. Yeah.
Hey, where in the States you from?

613
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:57,554
Melbourne.

614
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,264
Plenty of room tonight,
where would you like to sit?

615
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:02,600
Windy City, Big Apple or Hollywood?

616
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:06,730
Oh, well. Tell Mama that Roxie Hart
is coming home. Lipschitz.

617
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:11,235
Chicago.

618
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,157
Windy City.

619
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,660
Great, mate. Giddyap.

620
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,296
Here you are. Your fancy hot dog.

621
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:35,675
Howdy.

622
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:38,887
- Can I get some ranch dressing?
- Absolutely, ma'am.

623
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:41,640
Hey, partner. Here all right?

624
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:43,474
Yeah.

625
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:46,395
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

626
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,024
- Oh, no, you didn't.
- Yes.

627
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:53,819
Well, it actually happened.

628
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:02,828
Would you like some water?

629
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,581
Wise.

630
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:10,544
This is so cozy.

631
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:15,340
The food and the music, the boat and...

632
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:18,593
It really is...

633
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,095
<i>Gezellig</i>?

634
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:23,973
You keep saying that word.
Or are you just choking?

635
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:27,895
- <i>Gezellig</i>. That one?
- That's the one.

636
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,023
- Come on then. What does that mean?
- What...

637
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:34,484
I don't know. <i>Gezellig</i>.

638
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:37,779
There is no direct
English translation, I think.

639
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,532
It can mean cozy. Like a warm fire.

640
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:42,618
<i>Gezellig</i>.

641
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:45,662
But you can also keep your mind <i>gezellig</i>.

642
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:51,751
You know, your heart, your soul.
The people you're with. The places you go.

643
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:52,753
You know?

644
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:55,796
Even this, right now, here is...

645
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:56,882
<i>Gezellig</i>.

646
00:45:58,634 --> 00:45:59,843
Exactly.

647
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,492
They feel pretty dry.

648
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:43,762
All right. Where were we?

649
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:47,432
Wine.

650
00:46:56,817 --> 00:47:01,612
Here's your onion ring pyramid
and your freedom fries.

651
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:02,698
Thank you.

652
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:05,367
You enjoying the game?

653
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:07,910
Oh, yeah. Hey, you know what?

654
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:11,081
I bet you a thousand bucks
the Bulls will win 107 to 86.

655
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:13,417
I'm just kidding.

656
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:17,754
I remember watching this game
as a kid with my dad.

657
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:22,134
Yeah. I used to love
watching basketball with him.

658
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,306
Thank you for sharing.

659
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:32,311
And please feel free to choose
from our menu of 50 Nifty United Sauces.

660
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:35,314
And there's a lovely queso
from Puerto Rico.

661
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:40,151
You know what?
How about you just surprise me?

662
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:41,653
- Can do.
- Thanks.

663
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:47,158
<i>And the Bulls drop
into their triangle offense,</i>

664
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:50,077
<i>creating constant movement
between the players.</i>

665
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:52,539
<i>It's been the key to their success
this season.</i>

666
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:56,210
<i>It opens up for Jordan. He shoots. Yes!</i>

667
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:00,172
Pyramid ain't nothing but a triangle.

668
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:04,843
Actually, three triangles
all leaning on each other.

669
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:12,184
Howdy, Ted.

670
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:21,735
Hey. So, how does this one look?

671
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:26,734
Why'd you bring me this one?

672
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:29,034
It's the best one.

673
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:10,033
Well, this is mighty strange.

674
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,119
Hello?

675
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:15,663
<i>Hello, Ted.</i>

676
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:18,124
Hey, that's me. Who are you?

677
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:21,460
<i>I am the True Spirit of Adventure.</i>

678
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:24,590
I like that. Well, what's shaking, TSA?

679
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,593
<i>Do you know where triangles come from,
Ted?</i>

680
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:30,261
I don't know.
God dropped a square on the floor

681
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:31,679
and it broke in half long-ways
or something?

682
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,139
<i>- Whoopsie.
- No, Ted.</i>

683
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,976
<i>It's debated that the triangle
was first defined by Pythagoras</i>

684
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:40,479
<i>as any shape with three sides
and three corners.</i>

685
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,564
That's a good theorem.

686
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:45,651
<i>But throughout history, many believe
that triangles have held special powers.</i>

687
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:46,570
Oh, yeah.

688
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:50,031
<i>From the Holy Trinity of Christianity
to the trikaya of Buddhism.</i>

689
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:52,742
<i>There's also that spooky eye thing
on the back of the one-dollar bill.</i>

690
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:53,952
Oh, yeah.

691
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,457
<i>In some Native American cultures,
the triangle symbolizes home.</i>

692
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:02,043
I'm sorry Europeans kicked all
them folks out of their triangle.

693
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:05,588
<i>But the concept of the triangle
reached its zenith in 1989</i>

694
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:10,218
<i>when a man called Tex Winter,
an assistant coach for your Chicago Bulls,</i>

695
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:13,221
<i>introduced his triangle offense.</i>

696
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:14,847
<i>The central component of which was</i>

697
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:19,269
<i>for a player to always have two available
teammates to whom he could pass the ball.</i>

698
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:21,562
<i>These three players formed...</i>

699
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:22,647
A triangle.

700
00:50:22,648 --> 00:50:23,814
<i>Bingo, Ringo.</i>

701
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:26,610
<i>But that was never the only triangle
on the court.</i>

702
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:32,406
<i>For when the players moved,
they created more and more triangles.</i>

703
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,659
Hey, you're right.

704
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,161
<i>Actually, Ted, you're right.</i>

705
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:38,246
<i>Yes!</i>

706
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:39,957
Howdy, partner.

707
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,877
Hey. Can I borrow a pen?

708
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:46,379
- Come on, boy!
- Thanks.

709
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,382
<i>Yankee Doodle Burger Barn
Happy birthday</i>

710
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:52,468
<i>Yankee Doodle Burger Barn
Happy birthday, Mel</i>

711
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:55,513
<i>World War II was won by America</i>

712
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:58,474
<i>But the West was liberated
Thanks to Canada</i>

713
00:50:58,475 --> 00:50:59,601
<i>Hey!</i>

714
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:15,951
Do you play?

715
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:21,664
Yes, he... Yes, he does.

716
00:51:21,665 --> 00:51:25,878
He plays bass because Chet Baker...
Chet Ba... Do you know who Chet Baker is?

717
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:28,755
All right. Okay.

718
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:32,676
Players in.

719
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:37,097
Pillows ready.

720
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:40,558
Begin!

721
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:54,364
Let's get lost now.

722
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:47,876
Vanilla vodka.

723
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,738
- Oh, my God. He's still at it.
- Yeah. It's pretty amazing.

724
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,324
What the hell is he doing?

725
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:22,411
I don't know. But he's got my pen.

726
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:25,121
Derek's gonna make you buy a new one.

727
00:53:25,122 --> 00:53:26,832
Fucking hate Derek.

728
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:28,333
Yeah.

729
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:00,532
Fuck!

730
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:07,664
<i>Let's get lost</i>

731
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,327
Good morning.

732
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:50,206
So...

733
00:54:58,757 --> 00:54:59,758
Last night...

734
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:03,512
Did we...

735
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:06,056
Did we?

736
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,141
Did we...

737
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:14,522
No.

738
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:22,822
Breakfast?

739
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,952
No. I have to go.

740
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:30,663
Of course.

741
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:34,168
But... thank you...

742
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:39,214
You're welcome...

743
00:56:01,486 --> 00:56:02,613
I won't forget you.

744
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:04,364
Yeah, you might.

745
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:09,036
People get Alzheimer's.

746
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:24,384
Did we?

747
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:29,640
Oh, yes, we did.

748
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:36,062
I'm telling you, Amsterdam, amazing.
Like, yes, we lost the game,

749
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:38,857
but my boss played in a jazz band
and then...

750
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:51,828
Gerbrandt, Gijs, Gilles,
Brechje and Paul...

751
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:02,004
Okay, <i>doei.</i>

752
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,507
<i>Doei</i>!

753
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,550
- Hey, Will.
- You speak Dutch?

754
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:07,009
Don't tell Jan. Where's Ted?

755
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,012
- He's in the back.
- Thank you.

756
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:16,477
Mum? Sorry. Yes, no... What was I saying?

757
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:19,230
And then I met the most lovely couple,
and they invited me for a threesome.

758
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:20,607
<i>Bonjour</i>.

759
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:27,488
Coach.

760
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:28,574
Hey, Coach.

761
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:33,494
Wait, let me guess, Piggy Stardust.

762
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:36,456
- Rashers to rashers, oink to oinky.
- I love it.

763
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:41,753
Hey, sorry about last night.

764
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:43,880
No, that's okay. I'm sorry.

765
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:46,340
You know, I shouldn't have let you
wander around out there all alone

766
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:47,718
with a head full of tea, you know.

767
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:49,720
Good thing it was a dud batch.

768
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:53,181
What's that?

769
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:56,058
I wasn't feeling anything.
So I called Kenneth, he tried it,

770
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:58,394
couple hours later,
calls me up totally contrite.

771
00:57:58,395 --> 00:58:00,105
Confirmed, dud batch.

772
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:03,150
It happens.

773
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:09,061
Let me ask you a question here.

774
00:58:12,743 --> 00:58:13,744
Is this anything?

775
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:22,001
The way I see it,
we've been playing too rigid, you know?

776
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:23,462
Our guys need freedom.

777
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:27,925
Go wherever they wanna go.
Follow their guts, their hearts.

778
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:31,677
As long as they remember to fill
in the space that someone left behind.

779
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:33,805
They gotta have one another's backs,
that's for sure.

780
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:38,519
But, you know, it's just constant,
nonstop motion.

781
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:42,356
Just going from position to position
until positions don't really

782
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:44,900
even exist anymore.

783
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:48,278
It's fast, fluid, free.

784
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:51,156
With full support.

785
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:57,120
You come up with this yourself?

786
00:58:58,038 --> 00:58:59,038
Yeah?

787
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:02,501
Congrats.
You should call it Total Football.

788
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:04,586
I like that.

789
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:07,506
Which was invented right here
in Holland in the '70s.

790
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:16,181
You think we should try it?

791
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:17,975
Yes, I do.

792
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:21,687
All right, cool. Total Football.

793
00:59:24,815 --> 00:59:25,941
Room for one more?

794
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,573
Hey, boss.

795
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:40,706
So, 12 unanswered texts,
three un-haha'ed GIFs.

796
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:43,166
We good?

797
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:49,756
I'm sorry, Ted.
My phone is at the bottom of a canal.

798
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:53,510
Is that Keats?

799
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:55,679
Nope.

800
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:04,520
Yeah, okay.

801
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,315
Hey, Will, how we looking?

802
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:08,942
We're two short. Who's missing?

803
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:12,321
You lovely people!

804
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:18,451
Did you miss me?

805
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:19,828
Don't fucking ask.

806
01:00:20,746 --> 01:00:21,746
Let's go.

807
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:23,623
We saw a windmill!

808
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:24,707
All right.

809
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:25,834
Hell yeah.

810
01:00:27,669 --> 01:00:28,754
Come on!

811
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:31,673
I bet you the sex show was dope though.

812
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:35,761
- What?
- Leave it alone, man.

813
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:42,476
Everything okay, boss?

814
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:48,065
