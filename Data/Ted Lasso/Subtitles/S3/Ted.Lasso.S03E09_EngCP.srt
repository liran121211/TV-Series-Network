1
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,628
You know,
I didn't wanna say it at the time

2
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,466
'cause I'm trying to be
less stuck in my fucking ways...

3
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
But?

4
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,887
But I thought it was nuts to change
our entire philosophy

5
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,347
and style of play mid-season.

6
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,432
But?

7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,102
But it's fucking great.

8
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,979
You know, they're having fun,
we're having fun,

9
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,100
these folks are having fun.
It's a whole bunch of fun.

10
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,819
I haven't seen 22 dudes have
this good a time on grass

11
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,989
since I saw the Grateful Dead jamming
with the Black Crowes and Phish.

12
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,574
I bet that was a tight show.

13
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,327
It was a mess. But they had fun.

14
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:22,958
- Beautiful!
- Shoot!

15
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,299
Yeah!

16
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,260
Whistle! Whistle!

17
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,846
That's half. Great job.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,099
You hear that?
Roy said y'all did a great job.

19
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,230
Nice shot, mate.

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,533
Ay, Chihuahua.

21
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,078
I can't remember which pair is clean
and which one is dirty.

22
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,158
You bundle your dirty socks?

23
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,833
Just because they're dirty doesn't mean
they don't deserve to have a friend.

24
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,794
He's right. After all,
we're all mates with Richard.

25
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,014
Hey, boyo.

26
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,685
Do you wanna get a beer
or something later? Have a chat?

27
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,063
No.

28
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,787
Ay, no. I chose the dirty socks.

29
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,873
Oops.

30
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,445
So, have you heard from Jack yet?

31
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,532
{\an8}You know how you're never ever
supposed to write another text

32
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,076
{\an8}to an unanswered text?

33
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:22,578
{\an8}Of course.

34
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,080
Oh, God. You sent a double text.

35
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,798
So much blue.

36
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,925
I know.

37
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,220
It's like I got diarrhea of the thumbs
or something.

38
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,847
{\an8}Come here.

39
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,223
{\an8}Uh-oh.

40
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,225
{\an8}When girl talk turns into girl hug,

41
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,436
{\an8}you know that either means
something horrible's happened

42
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,854
{\an8}or absolutely nothing at all.

43
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,439
Jack's ghosting Keeley.

44
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,816
Oh, no.

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,695
First, she wants to go on a break,
and now the old digital Irish goodbye.

46
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,655
{\an8}Which is a term I never really understood.

47
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,116
{\an8}'Cause I got a buddy back home
named Seamus O'Malley,

48
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,619
{\an8}and that son of a gun hugs folks goodbye
for, like, 20 minutes

49
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,660
{\an8}before he leaves anywhere.

50
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,580
{\an8}Yeah, sorry to hear about that.

51
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,625
{\an8}Hey, I did make you some biscuits,
you know, just to soften the blow.

52
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,834
{\an8}Thanks, Ted.

53
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,086
{\an8}Thank you.

54
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,129
{\an8}What?
There's like 40 quid in here.

55
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,049
{\an8}I didn't know you were
gonna be here till this morning.

56
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,885
{\an8}No time to do anything special,
so I just tossed a little cash in there.

57
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,012
{\an8}That is very sweet. Thank you, Ted.

58
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,430
{\an8}Ain't nothing to it but to do it.

59
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,099
{\an8}Hey, boss. You mind if
I skip the press conference today?

60
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,393
{\an8}Michelle and I got these parent-teacher
meetings I don't wanna miss.

61
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,687
Of course, Ted. Family first.

62
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,688
I appreciate it.

63
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,400
We could have Roy do it.

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,560
{\an8}I know he hates that stuff,
but he is really good at it.

65
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,613
{\an8}I mean, you know, fine by me.

66
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,698
{\an8}Great idea.

67
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:45,076
{\an8}Look at you. Heartbroken,
but still kicking butt.

68
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,621
{\an8}I mean, I'm not heartbroken.
It's more like heart-bent.

69
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,956
{\an8}Heart-bent. I like that.

70
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,416
{\an8}It's a great title for a country song.
You know, like...

71
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,670
<i>I'm heart-bent in my apartment</i>

72
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,798
<i>'Cause all that you left
Was your fart scent</i>

73
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,007
All right. Goodbye, Ted.

74
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,759
{\an8}<i>And now that you're gone</i>

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,929
{\an8}<i>I wrote this song
'Cause all you left was</i>

76
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,848
{\an8}<i>The smell of your farts</i>

77
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,183
{\an8}- Coach Kent.
- Hey.

78
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,814
{\an8}Speak of the devil.

79
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,398
Okay.

80
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,735
- Keeley.
- Roy.

81
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,153
{\an8}So I need you to fill in for Ted

82
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,989
{\an8}at today's press conference,
if that's okay.

83
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,324
Fuck no.

84
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,788
I mean, why can't Ted do it?

85
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,044
I mean, I'd love to.

86
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,130
Wonderful.

87
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:39,882
Shall we?

88
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,594
Fuck.

89
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,637
I heard that.

90
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,570
Delivery for Mr. Shelby.

91
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,572
It's Shelley.

92
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,699
Oh, my... I'm so sorry.

93
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,743
{\an8}Hey, what are you doing here?

94
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,661
I brought you lunch.
Figured we'd have it here.

95
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,330
I'm surprised Derek gave you the time off.

96
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,581
{\an8}He said it was fine.

97
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,222
{\an8}As long as I brought him back
something with a West Ham logo on it.

98
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,086
Well, I can do that.

99
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,713
How about...

100
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,674
{\an8}There you go. Mouse pad.

101
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,843
{\an8}And he can have a scarf.

102
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,763
So sorry. There you go.

103
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,848
The... And there. That's the official pro...

104
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,477
And actually, you know...
Just don't have that.

105
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,020
I only need one.

106
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,315
{\an8}Well, you know, just keep them
for next time.

107
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,988
Oh, dang.

108
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,824
You got to his afternoon kiss
before I did.

109
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,660
Rupert, hello.

110
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,246
Okay. So, Jade, this is Rupert, my boss.

111
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,582
And, Rupert, this is Jade, my girlfriend.

112
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,168
Well, hello there.

113
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,088
- Hello.
- It's worthwhile to meet you.

114
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,132
Jade. What a beautiful name.

115
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,135
Thank you. It's actually short for Jaded.

116
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,054
My mother named me
after her favorite aunt.

117
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,305
But I don't care.

118
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:18,020
Hold on. I like to consider myself
a bit of a... an amateur dialectologist.

119
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:22,192
You are from the south of Poland, right?

120
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,611
Yes, I'm from Nowy Sącz.

121
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,239
Would you look at that smile.

122
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,117
Yeah, Jade,
if this young man wasn't so brilliant,

123
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,287
I'd say that you are out of his league.

124
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,834
What's that smell?

125
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,835
Jade surprised me with lunch.

126
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,213
It's from the Taste of Athens.
It's my favorite place.

127
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,549
I'm a hostess there.

128
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,343
Which is why it's his favorite place,
I would say.

129
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,595
Yeah.

130
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,639
Well, wonderful to meet you, Jade.

131
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,517
And, Nate, mate,

132
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,729
don't screw this up.

133
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,272
No.

134
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,400
Bye, Rupert.

135
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,070
He seems very wealthy. But also nice-like.

136
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,158
Yeah, no, he is.
He's actually really decent.

137
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,494
I owe him a lot. So...

138
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,871
Right.

139
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,208
It's so kind of you doing this, you know.

140
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,176
Pardon the interruption, Rebecca.

141
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:33,012
Did you know that Ted wasn't
doing his press conference today?

142
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,765
Yes. I asked Roy to fill in.

143
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,058
That explains it.

144
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,477
Is there a problem?

145
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,730
That is not what I said, Gary!

146
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,398
I have your quote right here!

147
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,650
You did say it, Coach.

148
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,069
- Stay out of this, Lloyd!
- Don't shout at Lloyd.

149
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,196
You said, and I quote,

150
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,407
"Joe Walsh is a better guitarist
than Jimmy Page."

151
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,202
That's what you said.

152
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,954
{\an8}Fine! I said it!

153
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,873
{\an8}But what I meant was
that Joe Walsh, underrated.

154
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,960
{\an8}Jimmy Page, overrated!

155
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,628
{\an8}I mean, Joe Walsh is a poet.

156
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:09,091
{\an8}Jimmy Page is a fucking
court stenographer on Adderall.

157
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:15,054
Are you out of your mind?
Page could beat Walsh with one string.

158
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,515
What do you mean beat him?
It's not a competition, man!

159
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,101
It's art, you fucking Neanderthal!

160
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,520
- Okay.
- Hello!

161
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,856
- Okay. I think this is over. Yeah.
- You're suspect!

162
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,023
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

163
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,734
Hello! I...

164
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,864
"Stairway to Heaven" is a glorified
fingering exercise, and you all know it!

165
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:33,699
So much passion.

166
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,285
I can't think of the last time

167
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,496
I was able to be here
with all you absolutely...

168
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,332
just brilliant members of the press
down here in the pressroom.

169
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,043
So with that in mind, I would love
to take some questions.

170
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,713
Come on, absolutely ask me anything.

171
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,382
- Yes.
- Marcus Adebayo, <i>The Independent</i>.

172
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,551
- Hello there, Marcus. How are you?
- Very well.

173
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,011
- Good. Yes?
- Miss Welton,

174
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:58,557
in your opinion, who's the greatest
classic rock guitarist of all time?

175
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,311
Great question.

176
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,068
Thank you. Thank you very much.

177
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,904
Sorry about that.

178
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,114
- "The guy from Cream."
- Yes, all right!

179
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,118
Don't start with me, Leslie! I panicked.

180
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,703
I'm gonna murder Roy Kent.

181
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:24,081
Look, Roy not doing press
is just Roy being Roy.

182
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,586
Oh, yes. Well, I am sick of Roy being Roy.

183
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,505
So, it's time for Rebecca to be Rebecca.

184
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,050
Oh, yes. Absolutely. I couldn't...

185
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,510
Yeah. There you go.

186
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,595
Yes!

187
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,850
No, you get back down there.

188
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,103
Why? I already did my 20, easily.

189
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,065
Yeah.
We don't start counting until it hurts.

190
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,733
And that goes for all of you!

191
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,361
Oi! Kent!

192
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,031
Get your hairy arse into my office. Now!

193
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,673
Every single one of you
knows my arse isn't hairy.

194
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,259
Yet none of you spoke up.

195
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,305
And I will never forgive you.

196
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,357
He's right. We're cowards.

197
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,199
Now, if she was talking
about Richard's butt...

198
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,962
So, are folks still dissecting frogs
in science class these days

199
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,673
or is it all just talking about
the frog's feelings now?

200
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,383
<i>Honestly? Both.</i>

201
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,136
<i>Ms. Ledbetter,
is there anything Henry can be doing</i>

202
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,846
<i>to bring up his grade in your class?</i>

203
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:02,848
Coach, can I...

204
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,392
Yeah, besides helium.

205
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:08,770
Isaac knows.

206
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,732
That Ted's son is failing science?

207
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,401
Scandal.

208
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,030
- How did he react?
- Not good.

209
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,282
He won't talk to me.

210
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,451
Give him a minute.

211
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,619
You shouldn't have to,
but some people need it.

212
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,621
Don't forget, you've known you were gay
for 20 years.

213
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,248
Much longer than that.

214
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,084
Once I was out of my mum,
I never looked back.

215
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,049
But I hear you. Thanks, Trent.

216
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,677
Yeah. Hey, but you know what my favorite
thing was about Sir Isaac Newton?

217
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,429
He was so down to Earth.

218
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,890
<i>Ted, we need to let her go.</i>

219
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,227
Yeah, we better go let Ledbetter go.

220
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,438
What the fuck is your problem?

221
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,942
Wait, I know this one. You are!

222
00:12:55,943 --> 00:13:00,780
If I ask you to do a press conference,
do the fucking press conference.

223
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,451
Okay. Shit. I'm sorry.
I didn't realize it was a big deal.

224
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,370
So you just didn't do it?

225
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,623
Is that the plan
for the rest of your life?

226
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,874
You're just gonna walk away
from everything

227
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,253
the second it isn't fun or easy?

228
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,341
What do you want, Roy?

229
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,386
What do you really want?

230
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,720
I just want to be left alone.

231
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,808
Oh, bullshit, Roy!
You want way more than that!

232
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,270
You're just so convinced that you
don't deserve anything good in your life,

233
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:35,983
that you'd rather eat a bowl of shit soup
and then complain about the portions.

234
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,695
Get out of your own way, man.

235
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:43,781
'Cause this whole "woe is me" thing
you've got going on

236
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,994
is just fucking ponderous.

237
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,458
Is that all?

238
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,503
Yeah, that's it.

239
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,590
For now.

240
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,213
How we looking for tomorrow?

241
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,965
Yeah. Great.

242
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,426
Think we should play without a goalie.
You know, just to give 'em a chance.

243
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,054
I love it when you're cocky.

244
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,017
Baklava.

245
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,311
Oh, yeah. Help y...

246
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,066
- Yeah.
- So lovely to meet Kate.

247
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,068
Jade. It's Jade.

248
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,570
Oh, yes. Of course. Jade. Yeah.

249
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,406
Well, she really enjoyed meeting you.

250
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,243
Nothing better than the love of a woman.

251
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,523
Sitting up there but it's just
a little bit... We'll get a drink.

252
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,693
Yo. Knock 'em dead, killer.

253
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,280
Well, I hope their kit man remembered
to bring 11 body bags.

254
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,701
Hey, after the match,
let's go for a drink. If you're up for it.

255
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:54,370
Yeah, that'd be great.
Shall I invite Jade?

256
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:58,166
No, I was thinking it was just
the two of us. You know, a guys' night.

257
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:02,171
Oh, yeah. That'd be lovely. I mean, cool.

258
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,676
Right, let's go blow some bubbles.

259
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,637
<i>Across town, West Ham are hoping
to stay top of the table</i>

260
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,181
<i>against Southampton.</i>

261
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:17,102
{\an8}While here at Nelson Road,
the red-hot Greyhounds face Brighton.

262
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,689
Color red tops off
at about 800 centigrade, Arlo.

263
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,359
The way Richmond are playing, a more
accurate description would be yellow-hot.

264
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,486
<i>Thank you for correcting me, Chris,</i>

265
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,157
<i>and next time feel free
to wait until we're off air.</i>

266
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,658
What's this?

267
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,329
We're so full we ran out of pint glasses.

268
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:37,872
Bottoms up.

269
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,127
<i>Bringing in the money</i>

270
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:45,213
That tastes better.

271
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:47,590
<i>The denizens of the Dogtrack have seen</i>

272
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,176
<i>their Greyhounds race up the table
of late.</i>

273
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,803
<i>The air is filled with
an unfamiliar confidence</i>

274
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,931
<i>of another trip to the winners' circle.</i>

275
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,225
- Leslie, did you just text me?
- I did.

276
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:59,394
- I'm sitting right here.
- I see that now.

277
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:01,980
It's Jack.

278
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,275
She's saying that she's in Argentina...

279
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,111
for the next couple of months.

280
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,780
Ouch.

281
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,284
Well, I think our break
is actually an "up."

282
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,247
So now that Jack is officially my ex,

283
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:23,835
please feel free to say any of the things
that you didn't like about her.

284
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,211
Well...

285
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,881
Her handshake was way too firm.

286
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:29,383
You know...

287
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,844
I get it. You're friendly.

288
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,555
Good riddance.

289
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,103
All right, yo. Let's do this, man.

290
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:45,649
Go get 'em, Captain.

291
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:49,569
Isaac.

292
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,906
All right, fellas, here we go.
Focus up, y'all.

293
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,532
Coach, who we got today?

294
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,158
Brighton and Hove Albion.

295
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,839
Brighton, Hove and Albion.
I didn't know we were playing a law firm.

296
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,624
Okay, let's bring it in. Here we go!

297
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,054
Go ahead, Captain. Count us off.

298
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,890
Richmond on C. A, B, C!

299
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,100
Richmond!

300
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:30,526
<i>Brighton have something going here,
until that heavy touch by Cooke.</i>

301
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,445
<i>Oh, no!</i>

302
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:32,820
<i>A thoughtless poke by McAdoo</i>

303
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,281
<i>and a Richmond goal kick
becomes a Brighton corner.</i>

304
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,658
<i>McAdoo lost concentration there.</i>

305
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,994
<i>An uncharacteristic mistake
from the captain.</i>

306
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:43,206
Well done, McAdoo, you fucking numpty!

307
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:46,251
<i>Some of the Richmond fans letting
McAdoo have a piece of their minds.</i>

308
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,921
<i>The corner comes in.</i>

309
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,005
<i>And the keeper collects.</i>

310
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,924
Yes, Zoreaux. Yes, good take, man.

311
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,008
It's actually Van Damme.

312
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,969
<i>Van Damme's been
a commanding presence, Chris.</i>

313
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,182
<i>Just like in the movie</i>
Timecop<i>, where he does the splits twice.</i>

314
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,602
Richmond with possession.

315
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,647
<i>Hughes has the ball.
He's looking for space.</i>

316
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,107
<i>It's not there. He passes back to Maas.</i>

317
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,487
<i>No! Cooke steps in, and Brighton are off.</i>

318
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,614
- <i>And just like that...</i>
- Fuck!

319
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,908
- <i>Joey Miller puts Brighton up 1-nil.</i>
- Shoot.

320
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,745
Oh, for fuck's sake! Fucking hell!

321
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:26,291
<i>Is this the beginning of the end of
Richmond's hot streak?</i>

322
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,793
- What the fuck, bruv?
- What?

323
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,670
- Their fucking goal's over there.
- Oh, right, yeah.

324
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,839
Fucking fix up.
Don't fucking walk away from me.

325
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,465
- Relax.
- Their fucking goal's over there.

326
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,342
<i>McAdoo is furious,</i>

327
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,177
- <i>remonstrating with Hughes for his error.</i>
- Wait? What?

328
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,888
- Don't fucking walk away from me!
- <i>Obisanya defuses the situation,</i>

329
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,390
- <i>but McAdoo remains incandescent.</i>
- Fuck!

330
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,643
- We have time. Come on!
- <i>My word.</i>

331
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:48,187
<i>Richmond asking
plenty of questions in the first half</i>

332
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,982
<i>but haven't been able to put anything
into Brighton's net.</i>

333
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,860
<i>As we enter one minute of stoppage time,</i>

334
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,529
the Seagulls would be thrilled
to go into the locker room

335
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,322
leading by a goal to nil.

336
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,532
<i>Any thoughts, Chris?</i>

337
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,325
<i>Seagulls are wretched creatures</i>

338
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,745
<i>who'll steal your car keys
right off your beach towel.</i>

339
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,748
<i>Richmond's starting to click.</i>

340
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:11,210
<i>This is the crisp ball movement
we've come to expect from them.</i>

341
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,380
<i>This is slick.
One-touch passing around the area.</i>

342
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,966
<i>Rojas is in.</i>

343
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,218
<i>Smothered by Brighton.</i>

344
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,512
<i>And that's the half.</i>

345
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:25,474
<i>Brighton's up 1-nil,
but it's still anyone's game.</i>

346
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:30,898
Same old Richmond. Still a shit show.

347
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,484
You're absolutely rubbish!

348
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:39,448
Stop passing the ball around
and bloody do something!

349
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,201
You're a disgrace to the badge!

350
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,913
You're all playing like
a bunch of fucking fa...

351
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,292
- What the fuck did you say to me?
- What?

352
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,669
What did you fucking say to me?

353
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:57,089
<i>Isaac McAdoo has jumped the wall
and charged into the seats.</i>

354
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,299
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

355
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,259
Oh, my God.

356
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,135
- I dare you to fucking say it again!
- <i>He appears to be</i>

357
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,846
<i>in a confrontation with one of
the Richmond supporters.</i>

358
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,389
Thataway, McAdoo. Get him.

359
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,600
Hang on. He's one of ours.

360
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,852
Say that word again!

361
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,437
You leave it!

362
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:13,022
- Say that fucking word again!
- Isaac!

363
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,316
Number five!

364
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,108
Fuck's sake.

365
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,110
The captain, man.

366
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,532
<i>It's an obvious red card.
McAdoo clearly has to go.</i>

367
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:25,409
<i>Roy Kent as the voice of reason.
What a world.</i>

368
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,911
Fuck's sakes.

369
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,455
Good lad. Oi!

370
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,873
Get him the fuck out of here!

371
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,083
What?

372
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:35,962
<i>After all hell broke loose,
halftime finally gets underway,</i>

373
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,549
<i>and the Greyhounds have much to discuss.</i>

374
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,587
All right, no one's gonna say nothing?
Sure, no, I'll kick it off.

375
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:18,788
Isaac, what the hell happened?

376
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,593
One of our fans said some ignorant shit!

377
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,847
Okay, what'd they say?

378
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,436
- I heard it.
- Okay.

379
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:33,978
He said the f-word.

380
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,316
- Fuck?
- No, the other f-word.

381
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:39,693
Oh, fuck.

382
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,366
If it helps, the fan has been removed.

383
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,578
And I apologize for my dad.

384
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,623
Sorry, not the time for jokes.

385
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,000
Read the room, Leslie.

386
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,753
Okay, I get it. I...

387
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:02,382
Isaac, look. What that guy said?
Inexcusable. All right?

388
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,134
But, man,

389
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:09,222
your reaction to it ain't gonna be taught
in any Tibetan monasteries anytime soon.

390
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,140
You know what I'm saying?

391
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:11,682
Yeah, now we're one man down.

392
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,561
Yeah, Isaac, come on, man.
It's nothing we haven't heard before.

393
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:20,192
Exactly. It's just poopy. Ignore it, man.

394
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:21,902
Ignore it?

395
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,321
I don't want to fucking ignore it.

396
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,033
What if one of us is gay?

397
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,747
We shouldn't have to deal with this shit!

398
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,345
All right.

399
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,348
- I got it.
- Yeah.

400
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,939
You think I should have it?

401
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,618
No, get out, Roy.
I don't need you to come in here.

402
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,412
Just leave me alone. Just fuck off, yeah?

403
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,789
I fucked it up. Just fucking fuck off.
Just leave me alone.

404
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,457
I don't need you to start yelling at me.

405
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,252
I'm not here to yell at you.

406
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,927
What the fuck was that all about?

407
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:31,180
I don't know.

408
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,517
Colin, do you know?

409
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:39,103
Guys, it's pretty obvious.

410
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,731
Isaac's gay, right?

411
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:46,402
Well, statistically speaking,
10% of the population is homosexual.

412
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,988
So it's not that surprising.

413
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,451
So there are probably more people
in this room who are gay.

414
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,130
I'm flattered.

415
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,926
Guys, we don't need to
discuss this any further, okay?

416
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:11,928
All Isaac needs now is our support.

417
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,973
Yeah. That's our captain.

418
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,101
All right, fellas,
let's focus on the second half.

419
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,230
- Now, what we got...
- Hold on.

420
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:23,857
Isaac's not gay.

421
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,862
I don't know what happened out there,

422
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:36,787
but I do know whatever it was
isn't what you're really angry about.

423
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:39,915
Is it?

424
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,716
So then trust me.

425
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,637
You got to go deal with that...

426
00:25:56,473 --> 00:26:00,018
or you're gonna fuck up
whatever it is you actually do care about.

427
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:06,817
He's right, you know.

428
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:15,534
The little things we get mad about
are like snowflakes on a mountain.

429
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,829
And if we wait too long,
then we're just one sneeze away

430
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,457
from an avalanche that will kill us all.

431
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:26,712
Thank you, Will.

432
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,729
- You want some bubble gum?
- Don't push it.

433
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:45,771
So, we cool?

434
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:46,940
Of course.

435
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:51,986
- Yeah.
- Of course. It's cool.

436
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:54,864
- Yeah. Yes, <i>amigo</i>.
- A thousand percent.

437
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,742
You're gay, big whoop. But we don't care.
Right, guys?

438
00:26:57,743 --> 00:27:01,162
- Yeah.
- All good, bro.

439
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:03,248
Now, hold on, actually.

440
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,294
Colin, we do care, you know.

441
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:11,423
When I was growing up back in Kansas City,
I had a buddy named Stevey Jewell.

442
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,051
Now, he was a huge Denver Broncos fan.

443
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,929
But we were all growing up smack dab
in the middle of Chiefs country.

444
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,223
So he used to catch a lot of guff for it,
you know?

445
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:25,479
But me? Me, I told him it didn't affect
the way I felt about him at all, you know?

446
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,023
I told him that I "didn't care."

447
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,150
And I didn't, you know.

448
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:34,530
But then in 19s... what, '97, '98,

449
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,116
he had to watch back-to-back Super Bowls
with the Denver Broncos in 'em

450
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,202
all by himself.

451
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:47,667
First one,
he ate an entire seven-layer dip

452
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,378
from Price Chopper all by himself.

453
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,130
Big ol' thing.
And it just wrecked his stomach.

454
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,383
Apparently, he destroyed the toilet
in his parents' basement.

455
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:57,510
I remember the rumor at the time being

456
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:59,805
that he caused $9,000 worth of damage.

457
00:28:00,848 --> 00:28:03,016
Could you imagine? To a toilet.
9,000 bucks.

458
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,353
The next year,
he did the exact same thing.

459
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,688
All by himself.

460
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:11,482
He must have thought it was good luck
or something. I don't know.

461
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,819
'Cause I wasn't there.
'Cause I "didn't care."

462
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,990
But I should've cared. You know?

463
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,410
I should've supported him.

464
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,791
I should've been at his house
both them years.

465
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,337
Sharing that seven-layer dip
with my friend

466
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:37,634
while his garbage-ass team wins
back-to-back Super Bowls.

467
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,559
Coach, did you just compare being gay
to being a Denver Broncos fan?

468
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,417
You know what? I did, and I regret it.
Yeah. Sorry about that.

469
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,732
What the fuck are Denver Broncos?

470
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,817
- No, that's a very good question.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

471
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,612
It's an American football reference,
an absolute fumble in this situation.

472
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:58,988
I apologize. Yeah. Okay.

473
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,949
But the point is, Colin...

474
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:06,330
we don't not care.

475
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:08,707
We care very much.

476
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:13,587
We care about who you are
and what you must've been going through.

477
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:15,839
Yeah?

478
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,258
But hey, from now on,

479
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,554
you don't have to go through it
all by yourself.

480
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,430
All right?

481
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:27,809
Yeah. You hear that? You got us, mate.
We got you.

482
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,646
Okay, well, look. Hey. I hate to
bring up work in a moment like this,

483
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,856
but we do have
a second half of a match to play.

484
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,024
Coach, what we got?

485
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,902
Playing a man down.
What do we do differently?

486
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,654
Absolutely nothing!

487
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,740
Let's go, baby.

488
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:45,868
Let's go.

489
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,539
Okay, all right. Captain, count us off.

490
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:54,169
Wow. That's me, yes. Okay.

491
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,381
I don't know what to say.

492
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:00,842
I'm honored to be your captain.

493
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:03,386
And, you know,
I love you guys so very much.

494
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,096
On three. One, two, three.

495
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:06,849
I love you guys so very much!

496
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:21,697
Better or worse than you imagined?

497
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:24,157
Second-best way it could've gone, I think.

498
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:27,869
Best way being the entire team confesses
that they're gay too,

499
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,830
and we get to be on the cover
of Oprah's magazine.

500
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:05,574
Cracking match, Coach.

501
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:07,743
Yeah. Thank you, Roger.

502
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:11,245
Hey, a few of us are getting a pint.
Care to join us?

503
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:14,833
Sounds good but I'm actually going
for a drink with Rupert tonight.

504
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:16,542
Just the two of us, so...

505
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,919
Are you in trouble?

506
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,547
Wh... No. It's just like guys' night, so...

507
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,841
Cool. Maybe next time?

508
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:24,927
Yeah.

509
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:36,687
- Yes!
- Yes!

510
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,397
- <i>And Richmond have done it.</i>
- Yes!

511
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:39,941
- How about that?
- Well done, sir.

512
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:42,109
<i>They complete the comeback
for a thrilling two-one win...</i>

513
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,612
- I love you so much, man.
- <i>behind an inspirational turn</i>

514
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:45,905
<i>from Colin Hughes.</i>

515
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,573
- Come on!
- <i>Assisting both goals...</i>

516
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:48,492
Yeah!

517
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:50,117
<i>In a man-of-the-match performance.</i>

518
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,119
<i>Wow, Hughes was sensational, Arlo.</i>

519
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,330
<i>After being benched
earlier this season...</i>

520
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,541
- AFC Richmond!
- <i>back in the starting lineup,</i>

521
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,919
<i>and today, the Welshman played
like a man reborn.</i>

522
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:05,925
A goal down, a man down,

523
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,511
the Greyhounds scored twice
in the second half.

524
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:11,514
Both assisted by an inspired Colin Hughes.

525
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:17,395
{\an8}But the real fireworks were at halftime
when Richmond's captain, Isaac McAdoo,

526
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:21,441
went into the stands
to attack one of their own fans.

527
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,610
In fairness, I wanted to do that
a few times myself, Jeff.

528
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,613
{\an8}Yeah, but you didn't, Clinton, 'cause
you're not a psychopath like McAdoo.

529
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:30,575
{\an8}- Now, George, you don't know what...
- Oh, no... Jeff. Jeff, come on.

530
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:33,953
You do not go into the stands.
I don't care what was said.

531
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:36,999
That is a line you do not cross.

532
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:40,251
And that's why McAdoo wasn't captain
when I was there.

533
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:41,711
'Cause he's not fit for it.

534
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:44,590
I mean, come on.
He makes Roy Kent look like Bambi.

535
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:46,841
He's an idiot, isn't he? Come on.

536
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,467
<i>- McAdoo doing that.
- Yes.</i>

537
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,553
<i>- What was he thinking?
- He's in big trouble.</i>

538
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:52,305
Guy probably deserved it though, right?

539
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,639
- Absolutely.
- No doubt.

540
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,767
I hope his kids shiv him in his sleep.

541
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:58,644
What? He used to come in here.

542
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,771
He was a dick to my niece, Claire, once.

543
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,315
- No way.
- Not Claire.

544
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:03,941
Fucking prick!

545
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:05,401
<i>Moving over to east London,</i>

546
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:08,739
<i>the Wonder Kid's West Ham
took care of business at home.</i>

547
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:17,080
And then he came in after me.

548
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:20,124
Hey, Rupert.

549
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,002
- You all right?
- Hey, Nathan.

550
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:26,422
Let me introduce Kelsie and Libby.

551
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:27,882
No. The other way around.

552
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:29,218
The other way.

553
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:32,387
Well, I'm still Rupert.

554
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:36,350
And this is Nathan Shelley,
the Wonder Kid.

555
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:37,934
Hey, you all right?

556
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,519
- Hi.
- Hey.

557
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,522
So, the girls will be joining us tonight.

558
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:43,607
Shall we?

559
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,321
Yum, yum, yum.

560
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:51,782
Thought it was a guys' night, Rupert.

561
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:56,286
Well, yes. Trust me, it is.

562
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:01,124
Oscar. We're off to the private room.

563
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,005
Couple of bottles of champagne, please.

564
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:12,928
Actually, Rupert.

565
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,681
I'm so sorry, I need to leave.

566
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:21,395
Long story.
I wanted to come and tell you in person.

567
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,869
Congratulations, Ted.
That's eight wins in a row.

568
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,953
Come on now, Trent.

569
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:40,831
You know I don't care
about winning or losing.

570
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,084
No, the truth is,
only way I could be happier

571
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,754
is if my arm-feet were covered
in barbecue sauce.

572
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,340
How you feeling about the win streak, Roy?

573
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:54,385
No way.
Do not come near me with that shit.

574
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,346
You never talk about a streak.

575
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,891
My grandparents were happily married
for 51 years

576
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:02,853
'cause they never said a fucking word
to each other. Scram.

577
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:06,064
Well done, gentlemen. Congrats.

578
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,317
Another one.

579
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:12,987
Oh, boy. Higgins hitting us
with his DJ Khaled impression. Nice.

580
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:13,947
Who?

581
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:16,199
- Parallel thinking.
- Apparently so.

582
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,702
The press is ready for you, Ted.
It's a big one.

583
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:21,204
That's what that lady
from the American <i>Office</i> said.

584
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:23,164
Okay, I'll be right there.

585
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:24,499
Okay.

586
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,800
- He's on his way.
- Thank you, Leslie.

587
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,261
You gave Ted some talking points?

588
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:39,264
No. I haven't done that in a long time.

589
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,808
Oh, God.

590
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:01,828
{\an8}Yeah. All right. You got me today.

591
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:04,373
Any questions?

592
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:07,501
Fucking hell.

593
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:10,795
You. Five-o'clock-shadow head.

594
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:16,592
Coach Kent, do you or the organization
condone what Isaac McAdoo did today?

595
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,345
What a stupid fucking question.

596
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,138
Course we don't.

597
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:24,642
What Isaac did was awful.
He was lucky he only got a red card.

598
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,353
Okay. So why'd he do it?

599
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:46,039
When I was first coming up
through Sunderland,

600
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,334
there was an old-timer on the team.
Local guy.

601
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,461
He and his wife were about to have
their first kid,

602
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,298
so during training one day,

603
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:58,760
I made a joke that, statistically,
I was probably the real dad.

604
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:04,557
And the boys fell about laughing,
but he went fucking nuts.

605
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:07,894
He battered me. Properly.

606
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:11,607
I had a black eye, chipped tooth,
three broken ribs.

607
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,067
I couldn't play for six games.

608
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,320
He got booted off the team.

609
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:21,074
After that, no club would go near him.

610
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,912
Then in the summer,
after I could breathe again,

611
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,080
I bumped into him in a pub.

612
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:31,210
And I got the chance to say sorry
for my stupid fucking joke.

613
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,089
And he got to tell me...

614
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:40,260
he and his wife had lost the baby...

615
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:43,263
a month before all that went down.

616
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:49,853
He hadn't told anyone. Kept it all inside.

617
00:37:56,568 --> 00:38:00,656
{\an8}Look, I get that some people think
if they buy a ticket,

618
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:05,577
{\an8}they've got the right to yell whatever
abusive shit they want at footballers.

619
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:10,832
{\an8}But they're not just footballers.
They're also people.

620
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:17,798
And none of us know
what is going on in each other's lives.

621
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:24,888
{\an8}So for Isaac to do what he did today,

622
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:27,099
{\an8}even though it was wrong...

623
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,061
{\an8}I give him love.

624
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:37,568
{\an8}And as for why he did what he did...

625
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,740
that's none of my fucking business.

626
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,121
Next question.

627
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,331
Yeah, New Trent.

628
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,126
Coach, let's talk about Colin Hughes.

629
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:57,212
Yeah, he's a hell of a player
and a great man.

630
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,422
I think we've underused him.

631
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:01,299
- I think you're right.
- Glad we agree.

632
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,218
I prefer you to Old Trent.

633
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,137
Next question.

634
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,312
You. Goblin King, go.

635
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:34,373
Hey.

636
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:36,335
Hey.

637
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,378
What happened to guys' night?

638
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:10,994
Hey.

639
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:16,875
You lied to me.

640
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:20,337
For years.

641
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:27,886
What is it about me
that made you think you couldn't tell me?

642
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,974
No, it was nothing to do with you.

643
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:34,268
It was about me.

644
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,231
I was 99% sure that you'd support me.

645
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:44,736
But the 1% chance that you wouldn't
scared the shit out of me.

646
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:54,579
I don't know how you did it.
I can't keep a secret for shit.

647
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,207
I know. Another reason I didn't tell you.

648
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,043
I mean, I hid it from people for years,

649
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:03,630
and the second you find out,
I didn't last a month.

650
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,180
I'm sorry, bruv.

651
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:15,934
You gonna tell everyone now?

652
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,230
No.

653
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:23,984
The team knows. And that's enough for me.

654
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,528
And no one's gonna say shit.

655
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:30,782
I promise.

656
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,165
Wanna come in?

657
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:45,464
Yeah, all right.

658
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:47,507
Come on.

659
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:05,484
Is "top or bottom"
sex positions or sleeping arrangements?

660
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,276
Sexual positions.

661
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:09,154
Unless bunk beds are involved.
Then it's both.

662
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,239
Would you ever shag a woman?

663
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,615
No, I'm gay.

664
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:14,701
I know, but what if you had to?

665
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:18,247
- 1967 Raquel Welch.
- My man.

666
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:22,918
- Who's the fittest guy on the team?
- I won't tell you, and you'd never guess.

667
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:25,879
- Bumbercatch.
- Yes.

668
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:29,298
What about team showers?
How does that work?

669
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:31,927
I keep my head down,
and I think of global warming.

670
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:34,929
Yeah, well, if I had to shower
with a bunch of girls all the time,

671
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,431
I'd defo get boners.

672
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,811
I love you, boyo.

673
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:45,524
You can't say it, can you?

674
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:48,569
No.

675
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,904
But you know I do, yeah?
