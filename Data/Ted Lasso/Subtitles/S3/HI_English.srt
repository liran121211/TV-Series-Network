00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,373
(players shouting)

2
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,375
(crowd cheering)

3
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,628
You know,
I didn't wanna say it at the time

4
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,466
'cause I'm trying to be
less stuck in my fucking ways...

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
But?

6
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,887
But I thought it was nuts to change
our entire philosophy

7
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,347
and style of play mid-season.

8
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,432
But?

9
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,102
But it's fucking great.

10
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,979
You know, they're having fun,
we're having fun,

11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,100
these folks are having fun.
It's a whole bunch of fun.

12
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,819
I haven't seen 22 dudes have
this good a time on grass

13
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,989
since I saw the Grateful Dead jamming
with the Black Crowes and Phish.

14
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,574
Ooh. I bet that was a tight show.

15
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,326
Oh, it was a mess. But they had fun.

16
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,371
(players shouting indistinctly)

17
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:22,957
- (player) Beautiful!
- (Jamie) Shoot!

18
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,333
(grunts)

19
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,961
(cheering)

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,712
Whoo!

21
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:31,008
- Yeah! Yeah!
- (laughing)

22
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,260
Whistle! Whistle!

23
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,845
That's half. Great job.

24
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,973
Whoo! You hear that?
Roy said y'all did a great job.

25
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,516
- (yelps)
- (chuckles)

26
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,312
- (players laughing, cheering)
- (Isaac) Whoo!

27
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,230
Nice shot, mate.

28
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,153
(sighs)

29
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,239
(players chattering)

30
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,533
(sniffs, sighs) Ay, Chihuahua.

31
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,078
I can't remember which pair is clean
and which one is dirty.

32
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,158
You bundle your dirty socks?

33
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,833
Just because they're dirty doesn't mean
they don't deserve to have a friend.

34
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,793
He's right. After all,
we're all mates with Richard.

35
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,130
(players laughing)

36
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,800
Ha! (chuckles)

37
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,261
(Jan chuckling)

38
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,014
(Colin) Hey, boyo.

39
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,685
Do you wanna get a beer
or something later? Have a chat?

40
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,063
No.

41
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,449
(sniffing)

42
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,787
Ay, no. I chose the dirty socks.

43
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:44,873
Oops. (chuckles)

44
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,214
{\an8}(theme music plays)

45
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,445
So, have you heard from Jack yet?

46
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,532
{\an8}You know how you're never ever
supposed to write another text

47
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,075
{\an8}to an unanswered text?

48
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,244
{\an8}(scoffs) Of course.

49
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,080
Oh, God. You sent a double text.

50
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,798
(gasps) So much blue.

51
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,341
I know. (sighs)

52
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,219
It's like I got diarrhea of the thumbs
or something.

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,555
{\an8}- Oh, come here. (chuckles)
- (grunts)

54
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,223
{\an8}- (knocking)
- Uh-oh.

55
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,225
{\an8}When girl talk turns into girl hug,

56
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,436
{\an8}you know that either means
something horrible's happened

57
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,854
{\an8}or absolutely nothing at all.

58
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,439
Jack's ghosting Keeley.

59
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,399
- (clicks tongue) Oh, no.
- Hmm.

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,694
First, she wants to go on a break,
and now the old digital Irish goodbye.

61
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,862
{\an8}Mm-mmm-mmm.

62
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,655
{\an8}Which is a term I never really understood.

63
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,116
{\an8}'Cause I got a buddy back home
named Seamus O'Malley,

64
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,619
{\an8}and that son of a gun hugs folks goodbye
for, like, 20 minutes

65
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,620
{\an8}before he leaves anywhere.

66
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,580
{\an8}- Mmm.
- (Ted) Yeah, sorry to hear about that.

67
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,625
{\an8}Hey, I did make you some biscuits,
you know, just to soften the blow.

68
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,834
{\an8}Oh, thanks, Ted.

69
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,086
{\an8}Thank you.

70
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,129
{\an8}What? (gasps)
There's like 40 quid in here.

71
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,049
{\an8}I didn't know you were
gonna be here till this morning.

72
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,885
{\an8}No time to do anything special,
so I just tossed a little cash in there.

73
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,012
{\an8}That is very sweet. Thank you, Ted.

74
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,430
{\an8}Ain't nothing to it but to do it.

75
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,099
{\an8}Hey, boss. You mind if
I skip the press conference today?

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,393
{\an8}Michelle and I got these parent-teacher
meetings I don't wanna miss.

77
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,687
Of course, Ted. Family first.

78
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,648
I appreciate it.

79
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:35,400
Ooh, we could have Roy do it.

80
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,560
{\an8}I know he hates that stuff,
but he is really good at it.

81
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,613
{\an8}I mean, you know, fine by me.

82
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,698
{\an8}Great idea.

83
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:45,076
{\an8}Look at you. Heartbroken,
but still kicking butt. (chuckles)

84
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,620
{\an8}I mean, I'm not heartbroken.
It's more like heart-bent.

85
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,956
{\an8}Ooh, heart-bent. I like that.

86
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,416
{\an8}It's a great title for a country song.
You know, like...

87
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,670
<i>I'm heart-bent in my apartment ♪</i>

88
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,798
<i>♪ 'Cause all that you left
Was your fart scent ♪</i>

89
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,007
- All right. Goodbye, Ted.
- (chuckles)

90
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,759
{\an8}- <i>And now that you're gone ♪</i>
- (Rebecca scoffs)

91
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,929
{\an8}<i>♪ I wrote this song
'Cause all you left was ♪</i>

92
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,848
{\an8} <i>The smell of your farts ♪</i>

93
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,183
{\an8}- (employee) Coach Kent.
- Hey.

94
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,727
{\an8}(Keeley chuckles)

95
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,397
{\an8}Oh, speak of the devil.

96
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,358
- Okay.
- (Keeley) Mmm.

97
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,735
- Keeley.
- Roy.

98
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,153
{\an8}So, uh, I need you to fill in for Ted

99
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,989
{\an8}at today's press conference,
if that's okay.

100
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,324
Fuck no.

101
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,788
I mean, why can't Ted do it?

102
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,044
I mean, I'd love to.

103
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,130
Wonderful.

104
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:39,882
- Shall we?
- Mmm.

105
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,594
Fuck.

106
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,637
I heard that.

107
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,570
(Jade) Delivery for Mr. Shelby.

108
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,572
It's Shelley.

109
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,699
Oh, my... I'm so sorry.

110
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,743
{\an8}Hey, what are you doing here?

111
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,661
I brought you lunch.
Figured we'd have it here.

112
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,330
I'm surprised Derek gave you the time off.

113
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:13,581
{\an8}He said it was fine.

114
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,222
{\an8}As long as I brought him back
something with a West Ham logo on it.

115
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,085
Well, I can do that. (laughs)

116
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,713
Um. Um, how about...

117
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,673
{\an8}Oh, there you go. Mouse pad.

118
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,843
{\an8}Uh... (straining) ...and
he can have a scarf.

119
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,803
- Ooh. (laughing) So sorry. There you go.
- (chuckles)

120
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,848
Um, the... And there.
That's the, uh... the official, um, pro...

121
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,477
And actually, uh, you know...
Just don't have that.

122
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,020
I only need one.

123
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,149
{\an8}Oh. Well, you know, just keep them
for next time. (chuckles)

124
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,988
Oh, dang.

125
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,824
You got to his afternoon kiss
before I did.

126
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,660
Rupert, hello. Um...

127
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,246
Okay. So, Jade, uh,
this is Rupert, my boss.

128
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,582
And, Rupert, this is Jade, my girlfriend.

129
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,168
Well, hello there.

130
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,088
- Hello. (chuckles)
- It's worthwhile to meet you.

131
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,132
Jade. What a beautiful name.

132
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,135
Thank you. It's actually short for Jaded.

133
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,054
My mother named me
after her favorite aunt.

134
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,305
But I don't care.

135
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:18,020
Hold on. I-I like to consider myself
a bit of a... an amateur dialectologist.

136
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:22,108
You are from the south of Poland, right?

137
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,610
- (chuckles)
- Yes, I'm from Nowy Sącz.

138
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,239
Oh, would you look at that smile.

139
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,117
Yeah, Jade,
if this young man wasn't so brilliant,

140
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,286
I'd say that you are out of his league.

141
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,371
(chuckles)

142
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,249
Mmm. What's that smell?

143
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,835
Oh. Um, Jade, uh, surprised me with lunch.

144
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,212
It's from the Taste of Athens.
It's my favorite place.

145
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,380
Ah.

146
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,549
I'm a hostess there.

147
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,343
Which is why it's his favorite place,
I would say.

148
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,595
- (chuckles)
- (Rupert) Yeah.

149
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,638
Well, wonderful to meet you, Jade.

150
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,307
(Nathan chuckles)

151
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,517
And, Nate, mate,

152
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,729
don't screw this up.

153
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,106
No. (chuckles)

154
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,400
Bye, Rupert. (chuckles)

155
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:08,070
He seems very wealthy. But also nice-like.

156
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,157
Yeah, no, he is. He's... (stammers)
He's actually really decent.

157
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,242
Mmm.

158
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,827
Uh, I owe him a lot. So... (chuckles)

159
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,871
(sighs) Right.

160
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,208
It's so kind of you doing this, you know.

161
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,175
Pardon the interruption, Rebecca.

162
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:33,012
Um, did you know that Ted wasn't
doing his press conference today?

163
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,764
Uh, yes. I asked Roy to fill in.

164
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,058
Ah. That explains it.

165
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,476
Is there a problem?

166
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,562
Um...

167
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,730
That is not what I said, Gary!

168
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,398
I have your quote right here!

169
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,650
You did say it, Coach.

170
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,069
- (Coach Beard) Stay out of this, Lloyd!
- (Sarah) Don't shout at Lloyd.

171
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,196
You said, and I quote,

172
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,407
"Joe Walsh is a better guitarist
than Jimmy Page."

173
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,248
- That's what you said.
- (reporters clamoring)

174
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,954
{\an8}Fine! I said it!

175
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,873
{\an8}But what I meant was
that Joe Walsh, underrated.

176
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,959
{\an8}Jimmy Page, overrated!

177
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,628
{\an8}- (reporters clamoring)
- I mean, Joe Walsh is a poet.

178
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:09,090
{\an8}Jimmy Page is... (stammers) ...a fucking
court stenographer on Adderall.

179
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,299
(reporters clamoring)

180
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,054
Are you out of your mind?
Page could beat Walsh with one string.

181
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,515
What do you mean beat him?
It's not a competition, man!

182
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,100
It's art, you fucking Neanderthal!

183
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,060
(clamoring continues)

184
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,520
- (Higgins) Okay.
- Hello!

185
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,856
- Okay, okay. I think this is over. Yeah.
- You're suspect!

186
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,023
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

187
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,734
Hello! Hello! I...

188
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,863
"Stairway to Heaven" is a glorified
fingering exercise, and you all know it!

189
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,699
(chuckles) So much passion.

190
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,285
I... I can't think of the last time

191
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,496
I was able to be here with all you
absolutely... (stammers)

192
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,332
Just brilliant members of the press
down here in the pressroom.

193
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,043
So with that in mind, I would love
to take some questions.

194
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,713
Come on, absolutely ask me anything.

195
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,382
- Yes, yes.
- Uh, Marcus Adebayo, <i>The Independent</i>.

196
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,551
- Hello there, Marcus. How are you?
- Very well.

197
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,011
- Good, good. Yes?
- Miss Welton,

198
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:58,556
in your opinion, who's the greatest
classic rock guitarist of all time?

199
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,683
(reporters murmuring)

200
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,310
(exhales sharply) Great question.

201
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,395
Ooh.

202
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,523
Uh... (stammers)

203
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:11,110
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- (reporters clamoring)

204
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,612
(shudders) Sorry about that.

205
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,114
- (chuckles) "The guy from Cream."
- Yes, all right!

206
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,117
Don't start with me, Leslie!
I... (inhales deeply) I panicked.

207
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,703
(breathes heavily)
I'm gonna murder Roy Kent.

208
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:24,081
Oh, look, Roy not doing press
is just Roy being Roy.

209
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,585
Oh, yes. Well, I am sick of Roy being Roy.

210
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,003
Mmm. Mmm.

211
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,505
So, it's time for Rebecca to be Rebecca.

212
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,049
Oh, yes. Absolutely. I couldn't...

213
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,510
Ooh. Yeah. There you go.

214
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,639
Yes! Ooh! (imitates explosion)

215
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,850
No, you get back down there.

216
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,103
Why? I already did my 20, easily.

217
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,065
Yeah.
We don't start counting until it hurts.

218
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,733
And that goes for all of you!

219
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,361
Oi! Kent!

220
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,031
Get your hairy arse into my office. Now!

221
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,121
- (players murmuring, chuckling)
- (door closes)

222
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,830
(players chuckling, whistling) Ooh!

223
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,673
Every single one of you
knows my arse isn't hairy.

224
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,259
Yet none of you spoke up.

225
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,305
And I will never forgive you.

226
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,187
(door closes)

227
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:30,357
He's right. We're cowards.

228
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,068
Now, if she was talking
about Richard's butt...

229
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,278
(players clamoring)

230
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,739
(mumbling, blowing kisses)

231
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,367
(speaking French)

232
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,539
(players chattering, laughing)

233
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:52,962
So, are folks still dissecting frogs
in science class these days

234
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,673
or is it all just talking about
the frog's feelings now?

235
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,383
(teacher) <i>Honestly? Both.</i>

236
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,136
(Michelle) <i>Ms. Ledbetter,
is there anything Henry can be doing</i>

237
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,846
<i>to bring up his grade in your class?</i>

238
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:02,848
Coach, can I...

239
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,976
- Yeah, besides helium.
- (Ms. Ledbetter chuckles)

240
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:08,770
Isaac knows.

241
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,732
That Ted's son is failing science?

242
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,401
Scandal.

243
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,030
- How did he react?
- Not good.

244
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,282
He won't talk to me.

245
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,451
Give him a minute.

246
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,619
You shouldn't have to,
but some people need it.

247
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,621
Don't forget, you've known you were gay
for 20 years.

248
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,248
Much longer than that.

249
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,084
Once I was out of my mum,
I never looked back.

250
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,920
(swallows)

251
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,048
(sighing) But I hear you. Thanks, Trent.

252
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,299
Mmm.

253
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,677
Yeah. Hey, but you know what my favorite
thing was about Sir Isaac Newton?

254
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,429
He was so down to Earth. (chuckles)

255
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,890
- (Ms. Ledbetter chuckles)
- (Michelle) <i>Ted, we need to let her go.</i>

256
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,644
- Yeah, we better go let Ledbetter go.
- (Ms. Ledbetter chuckles)

257
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,438
What the fuck is your problem?

258
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,942
Oh, wait, I know this one. You are!

259
00:12:55,943 --> 00:13:00,780
If I ask you to do a press conference,
do the fucking press conference.

260
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,451
Okay. Shit. I'm sorry.
I didn't realize it was a big deal.

261
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,370
So you just didn't do it?

262
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,623
Is that the plan
for the rest of your life?

263
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,874
You're just gonna walk away
from everything

264
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,252
the second it isn't fun or easy?

265
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,171
(sighs)

266
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,883
What do you want, Roy? Hmm?

267
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,386
What do you really want?

268
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,720
I just want to be left alone.

269
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,808
Oh, bullshit, Roy!
You want way more than that!

270
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,270
You're just so convinced that you
don't deserve anything good in your life,

271
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:35,983
that you'd rather eat a bowl of shit soup
and then complain about the portions.

272
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,695
Get out of your own way, man.

273
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:43,781
'Cause this whole "woe is me" thing
you've got going on

274
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,994
is just fucking ponderous.

275
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,458
Is that all?

276
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,503
Yeah, that's it.

277
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,590
For now.

278
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,936
(sighs)

279
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,213
How we looking for tomorrow?

280
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,965
Oh, um, yeah... (chuckles) ...great.

281
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,426
Think we should play without a goalie.
You know, just to give 'em a chance.

282
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,054
I love it when you're cocky.

283
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,017
Oh, baklava.

284
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,311
Oh, yeah. Help y...

285
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,066
- Yeah.
- So lovely to meet Kate.

286
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,068
Oh, Jade. It's Jade.

287
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,570
Oh, yes. Of course. Jade. Yeah.

288
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,406
Well, she really enjoyed meeting you.

289
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,243
Nothing better than the love of a woman.

290
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,345
(crowd singing indistinctly)

291
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,523
Sitting up there but it's just
a little bit... We'll get a drink.

292
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,693
Yo. Knock 'em dead, killer.

293
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,279
Well, I hope their kit man remembered
to bring 11 body bags. (chuckles)

294
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,701
(chuckles) Hey, after the match,
let's go for a drink. If you're up for it.

295
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:54,370
Yeah, that'd be great.
Shall I invite Jade?

296
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:58,166
No, I was thinking it was just
the two of us. You know, a guys' night.

297
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:02,171
Oh, yeah. (stammers)
That'd be lovely. I mean... I mean, cool.

298
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,676
(Rupert)
Right, let's go blow some bubbles.

299
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,637
(Arlo) <i>Across town, West Ham are hoping
to stay top of the table</i>

300
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,181
- <i>against Southampton.</i>

301
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:17,102
{\an8}While here at Nelson Road,
the red-hot Greyhounds face Brighton.

302
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,689
Color red tops off
at about 800 centigrade, Arlo.

303
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,359
The way Richmond are playing, a more
accurate description would be yellow-hot.

304
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,486
- (bar patrons chattering)
- <i>Thank you for correcting me, Chris,</i>

305
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,157
<i>and next time feel free
to wait until we're off air.</i>

306
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,658
What's this?

307
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,371
We're so full we ran out of pint glasses.
(chuckles)

308
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:37,872
Bottoms up.

<i>Bringing in the money ♪</i> (chuckles)

310
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:45,213
That tastes better.

<i>of another trip to the winners' circle.</i>

315
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,225
- Leslie, did you just text me?
- I did.

316
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:59,394
- I'm sitting right here.
- I see that now.

317
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:01,980
Oh, it's Jack.

318
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,733
- She's saying that she's in Argentina...
- (scoffs)

319
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,111
For the next couple of months.

320
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,780
Ouch.

321
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,284
Well, I think our break
is actually an "up."

322
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,247
So now that Jack is officially my ex,

323
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:23,835
please feel free to say any of the things
that you didn't like about her.

324
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,211
- Well...
- Ooh.

325
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,881
Her handshake was way too firm.

326
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,132
You know... (groaning)

327
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:33,469
I get it. You're friendly.
(chuckles, mutters)

328
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,555
Good riddance.

329
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:38,724

(Thierry)
All right, yo. Let's do this, man.

331
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:45,649
Go get 'em, Captain.

332
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:49,569
Isaac.

333
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,906
All right, fellas, here we go.
Focus up. Focus up, y'all.

334
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,532
Coach, who we got today?

335
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,158
Brighton and Hove Albion.

336
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,536
Brighton, Hove and Albion.
I didn't know we were playing a law firm.

00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:01,038
(players chuckling)

338
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,623
Okay, let's bring it in. Here we go!

339
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,419
(players applauding, clamoring)

340
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,054
(Ted) Go ahead, Captain. Count us off.

341
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,890
Richmond on C. A, B, C!

342
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,099
(all) Richmond!

343
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,311
(players applauding, clamoring)

344
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:30,526
(Arlo) <i>Brighton have something going here,
until that heavy touch by Cooke.</i>

345
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,445
<i>Oh, no!</i>

346
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:32,820
<i>A thoughtless poke by McAdoo</i>

347
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,281
<i>and a Richmond goal kick
becomes a Brighton corner.</i>

348
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,658
- (Chris) <i>McAdoo lost concentration there.</i>
- (patrons groaning)

349
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,994
(Arlo) <i>An uncharacteristic mistake
from the captain.</i>

350
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:43,206
Well done, McAdoo, you fucking numpty!

351
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:46,251
(Arlo) <i>Some of the Richmond fans letting
McAdoo have a piece of their minds.</i>

352
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,921
<i>The corner comes in.</i>

353
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,005
<i>And the keeper collects.</i>

354
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,924
Yes, Zoreaux. Yes, good take, man.

355
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,008
It's actually Van Damme.

356
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,969
(Arlo) <i>Van Damme's been
a commanding presence, Chris.</i>

357
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,182
(Chris) <i>Just like in the movie</i>
Timecop<i>, where he does the splits twice.</i>

358
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,602
Richmond with possession.

359
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,647
<i>Hughes has the ball.
He's looking for space.</i>

360
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,107
<i>It's not there. He passes back to Maas.</i>

361
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,486
<i>No! Cooke steps in, and Brighton are off.</i>

362
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,487
(players shouting)

363
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,614
- (Arlo) <i>And just like that...</i>
- Fuck!

364
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,908
- <i>Joey Miller puts Brighton up 1-nil.</i>
- Shoot.

365
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,745
- (crowd clamoring)
- Oh, for fuck's sake! Fucking hell!

366
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:26,291
(Arlo) <i>Is this the beginning of the end of
Richmond's hot streak?</i>

367
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,793
- What the fuck, bruv?
- What?

368
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,670
- Their fucking goal's over there.
- Oh, right, yeah.

369
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,839
Fucking fix up.
Don't fucking walk away from me.

370
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,465
- Relax.
- Their fucking goal's over there.

371
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,342
(Arlo) <i>McAdoo is furious,</i>

372
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,177
- <i>remonstrating with Hughes for his error.</i>
- Wait? What?

373
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,888
- Don't fucking walk away from me!
- (Arlo) <i>Obisanya defuses the situation,</i>

374
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,390
- <i>but McAdoo remains incandescent.</i>
- Fuck!

375
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,643
- We have time. Come on!
- (Arlo) <i>My word.</i>

376
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:48,187
<i>Richmond asking
plenty of questions in the first half</i>

377
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,982
<i>but haven't been able to put anything
into Brighton's net.</i>

378
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,860
<i>As we enter one minute of stoppage time,</i>

379
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,529
the Seagulls would be thrilled
to go into the locker room

380
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,322
leading by a goal to nil.

381
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,532
<i>Any thoughts, Chris?</i>

382
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,325
(Chris) <i>Seagulls are wretched creatures</i>

383
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,745
<i>who'll steal your car keys
right off your beach towel.</i>

384
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,414
(patrons clamoring)

385
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,748
(Arlo) <i>Richmond's starting to click.</i>

386
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:11,210
<i>This is the crisp ball movement
we've come to expect from them.</i>

387
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,380
<i>Oh, this is slick.
One-touch passing around the area.</i>

388
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,965
<i>Rojas is in.</i>

389
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,218
- <i>Oh! Smothered by Brighton.</i>
- (crowd gasping, groaning)

390
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,512
- (whistle blows)
- (Arlo) <i>And that's the half.</i>

391
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:25,474
<i>Brighton's up 1-nil,
but it's still anyone's game.</i>

392
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:30,898
(fan 1, singsongy)
Same old Richmond. Still a shit show.

393
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,484
You're absolutely rubbish!

394
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:39,448
Stop passing the ball around
and bloody do something!

395
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,201
You're a disgrace to the badge!

396
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:45,912
You're all playing like
a bunch of fucking fa...

397
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:48,247
(crowd clamoring)

398
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,292
- What the fuck did you say to me?
- What?

399
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,669
- What did you fucking say to me?
- (crowd clamoring)

400
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,089
(Arlo) <i>Isaac McAdoo has jumped the wall
and charged into the seats.</i>

401
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,299
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

402
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,259
Oh, my God.

403
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,135
- I dare you to fucking say it again!
- (Arlo) <i>He appears to be</i>

404
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,846
<i>in a confrontation with one of
the Richmond supporters.</i>

405
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,389
Thataway, McAdoo. Get him.

406
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,600
Hang on. He's one of ours.

407
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,852
Say that word again!

408
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,437
You leave it!

409
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:13,022
- Say that fucking word again!
- Isaac!

410
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,316
- (whistle blows)
- Number five!

411
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:15,943
Fuck's sake.

412
00:21:15,944 --> 00:21:18,110
- (all groaning)
- The captain, man.

413
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,532
(Arlo) <i>It's an obvious red card.
McAdoo clearly has to go.</i>

414
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:25,409
(Chris) <i>Roy Kent as the voice of reason.
What a world.</i>

415
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,911
- (Isaac) Fuck's sakes.
- (crowd clamoring)

416
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,455
Good lad. Oi!

417
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,873
Get him the fuck out of here!

418
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,083
- (crowd jeering)
- What?

419
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:35,962
(Arlo) <i>After all hell broke loose,
halftime finally gets underway,</i>

420
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,549
<i>and the Greyhounds have much to discuss.</i>

421
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,931
(breathing shakily)

422
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,152
- (door closes)
- (Isaac breathing heavily)

423
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,446
(door closes)

424
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,587
All right, no one's gonna say nothing?
Sure, no, I'll kick it off.

425
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:18,671
Isaac, what the hell happened?

426
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:22,593
(breathes shakily)
One of our fans said some ignorant shit!

427
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,847
Okay. Okay, what... (stammers)
what'd they say?

428
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,436
- I... I heard it.
- (Ted) Okay.

429
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:33,978
He said the f-word.

430
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,315
- Fuck?
- No, the other f-word.

431
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:39,693
- (players) Oh.
- Oh, fuck.

432
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,279
(players murmuring)

433
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,366
If it helps, the fan has been removed.

434
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,578
And I apologize for my dad.

435
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,205
- (player groans)
- (chuckles)

436
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,623
Sorry, not the time for jokes.

437
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,416
Um, read the room, Leslie. (scoffs)

438
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,294
Okay. Okay, I get it. I get it. I... Um...

439
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:02,382
Isaac, look. What that guy said?
Inexcusable. All right?

440
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,134
But, man... (chuckles)

441
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:09,222
Your reaction to it ain't gonna be taught
in any Tibetan monasteries anytime soon.

442
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,140
You know what I'm saying?

443
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:11,682
Yeah, now we're one man down.

444
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,560
Yeah, Isaac, come on, man.
It's nothing we haven't heard before.

445
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:17,522
(players clamoring)

446
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:20,192
Exactly. It's just poopy. Ignore it, man.

447
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:21,902
Ignore it?

448
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,321
I don't want to fucking ignore it.

449
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:30,244
What if one of us is gay? Huh?

450
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,747
We shouldn't have to deal with this shit!

451
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:41,964
(huffs)

452
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,175
(door slams)

453
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:48,345
All right.

454
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,348
- I... I got it.
- Yeah, yeah.

455
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,769
(mouthing words)

456
00:23:56,854 --> 00:24:00,022
- (mouthing words)
- (softly) You think I should have it?

457
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,441
(mumbles)

458
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,618
No, get out, Roy. I don't...
I don't need you to come in here.

459
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,412
Just leave me alone. Just fuck off, yeah?

460
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,789
I fucked it up. Just fucking fuck off.
Just leave me alone.

461
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,457
I don't need you to start yelling at me.

462
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,252
I'm not here to yell at you.

463
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:27,009
(sighs)

464
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,927
What the fuck was that all about?

465
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:33,931
- (player 1) I don't know.
- (players murmuring)

466
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,517
Colin, do you... do you know?

467
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:39,103
Guys, it's pretty obvious.

468
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,730
Isaac's gay, right?

469
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:42,732
- Oh.
- (players murmuring)

470
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:46,402
(Jan) Well, statistically speaking,
10% of the population is homosexual.

471
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,988
So it's not that surprising.

472
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,450
So there are probably more people
in this room who are gay.

473
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,536
(players murmuring)

474
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:06,756
- (clicks tongue) I'm flattered.
- (players chuckling)

475
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:09,926
Guys... Guys, we don't need to
discuss this any further, okay?

476
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:11,928
All Isaac needs now is our support.

477
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,973
- (players murmuring)
- (player 2) Yeah. That's our captain.

478
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,101
(Ted) All right, fellas,
let's focus on the second half.

479
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,262
- Now, what we got...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

480
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:23,857
Isaac's not gay.

481
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,862
I don't know what happened out there,

482
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:36,787
but I do know whatever it was
isn't what you're really angry about.

483
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:39,915
Is it?

484
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:44,086
(sighs)

485
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,716
So then trust me.

486
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,637
You got to go deal with that...

487
00:25:56,473 --> 00:26:00,018
or you're gonna fuck up
whatever it is you actually do care about.

488
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:06,817
(Will) He's right, you know.

489
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:11,863
(inhales deeply)

490
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:15,534
The little things we get mad about
are like snowflakes on a mountain.

491
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,829
And if we wait too long,
then we're just one sneeze away

492
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,457
from an avalanche that will kill us all.

493
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:26,712
Thank you, Will.

494
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,509
- You want some bubble gum?
- Don't push it.

495
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,510
(Will mumbles)

496
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,431
(players murmuring)

497
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:45,771
(sighs) So, we cool?

498
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,732
- (Bumbercatch) Of course.
- (players murmuring)

499
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:51,986
- Yeah.
- Of course. It's cool.

500
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:54,864
- (Dani) Yeah, yeah. Yes, <i>amigo</i>.
- A thousand percent.

501
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,742
You're gay, big whoop. But we don't care.
Right, guys?

502
00:26:57,743 --> 00:27:01,162
- (players murmuring) Yeah. Yeah.
- (Jan) All good, bro.

503
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:03,247
(stammers) Now, hold on.
(stammering) Hold on, actually.

504
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:07,294
(stammers) Colin, we do care, you know.

505
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:11,423
When I was growing up back in Kansas City,
I had a buddy named Stevey Jewell.

506
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,051
Now, he was a huge Denver Broncos fan.

507
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,929
But we were all growing up smack dab
in the middle of Chiefs country.

508
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,223
So he used to catch a lot of guff for it,
you know?

509
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:25,479
But me? Me, I-I told him it didn't affect
the way I felt about him at all, you know?

510
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,023
I told him that I "didn't care."

511
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,150
(stammers) And I didn't, you know.

512
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:34,530
But then in 19s... what, '97, '98,

513
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,116
he had to watch back-to-back Super Bowls
with the Denver Broncos in 'em

514
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,202
all by himself.

515
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:47,667
First one,
he ate an entire seven-layer dip

516
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,378
from Price Chopper all by himself.

517
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,130
Big ol' thing.
And it just wrecked his stomach.

518
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,383
Apparently, he destroyed the toilet
in his parents' basement.

519
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:57,510
(stammers) I remember the rumor
at the time being

520
00:27:57,511 --> 00:28:00,763
- that he caused $9,000 worth of damage.
- (player exclaims)

521
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,016
Could you imagine? To a toilet.
9,000 bucks.

522
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,770
The next year,
he did the exact same thing. (chuckles)

523
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,688
All by himself.

524
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:11,482
He must have thought it was good luck
or something. I don't know.

525
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,819
'Cause I wasn't there.
'Cause I "didn't care."

526
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,990
But I should've cared. You know?

527
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,410
I should've supported him.

528
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,791
I-I should've been at his house
both them years.

529
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,337
Sharing that seven-layer dip
with my friend

530
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:37,634
while his garbage-ass team wins
back-to-back Super Bowls.

531
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,559
Coach, did you just compare being gay
to being a Denver Broncos fan?

532
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,353
You know what? I did, and I regret it.
Yeah. Sorry about that.

533
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,105
(players murmuring)

534
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,732
What the fuck are Denver Broncos?

535
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,817
- (Ted) No, that's a very good question.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

536
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,612
It's an American football reference,
an absolute fumble in this situation.

537
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:58,988
I apologize. Yeah. Okay.

538
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,949
But... (stammers) ...the point is, Colin...

539
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:06,330
we don't not care.

540
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:08,707
We care very much.

541
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:13,587
We care about who you are
and what you must've been going through.

542
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:15,839
Yeah?

543
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,258
But hey, from now on,

544
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,553
you don't have to go through it
all by yourself.

545
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,430
- (players murmuring)
- (Ted) All right?

546
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:27,809
Yeah. You hear that? You got us, mate.
We got you.

547
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,646
Okay, well, look. Hey. I hate to
bring up work in a moment like this,

548
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,856
but we do have
a second half of a match to play.

549
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,024
Coach, what we got?

550
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,902
Playing a man down.
What do we do differently?

551
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:39,654
(players) Absolutely nothing!

552
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:42,157
- (cheering, chattering)
- Let's go. Let's go, baby.

553
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:45,868
(Colin) Let's go.

554
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:48,539
(Ted) Okay, okay. All right.
Captain, count us off.

555
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:54,168
Oh, wow. That's me, yes. Um, okay.

556
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,381
(sighs, stammers)
I don't know what to say. Um...

557
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,842
(stammers) I'm honored to be your captain.

558
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:03,386
And, um, you know,
I-I love you guys so very much.

559
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,096
On three. One, two, three.

560
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:06,848
(all) I love you guys so very much!

561
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,642
(cheering, clamoring)

562
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:21,696
- (exhales deeply)
- Better or worse than you imagined?

563
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:24,157
Uh, second-best way it could've gone,
I think.

564
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:27,869
Best way being the entire team confesses
that they're gay too,

565
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,787
and we get to be on the cover
of Oprah's magazine.

566
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,081
(both chuckle)

567
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:39,923
Hmm.

568
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,808
(phone chimes)

569
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:05,573
Cracking match, Coach.

570
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:07,743
Oh. Yeah. Oh, thank you, Roger.

571
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:11,245
Hey, a few of us are getting a pint.
Care to join us?

572
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:14,832
Sounds good but, um, I'm actually going
for a drink with Rupert tonight.

573
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,542
- (Roger) Oh.
- Just the two of us, so...

574
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,919
Are you in trouble?

575
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,547
Wh... No, no.
It's just like, um, guys' night, so...

576
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,841
Cool. Maybe next time?

577
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:24,927
Yeah.

578
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:34,727
- (crowd cheering)
- (whistle blows)

579
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,687
- Yes!
- (Jamie) Yes!

580
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,397
- (Arlo) <i>And Richmond have done it.</i>
- Yes!

581
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:39,941
- How about that?
- Well done, sir.

582
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:42,109
(Arlo) <i>They complete the comeback
for a thrilling two-one win...</i>

583
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,612
- I love you so much, man.
- <i>behind an inspirational turn</i>

584
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:45,905
<i>from Colin Hughes.</i>

585
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,573
- Come on!
- (Arlo) <i>Assisting both goals...</i>

586
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:48,492
- Yeah!
- (Higgins) Whoo!

587
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:50,117
(Arlo) <i>...in a
man-of-the-match performance.</i>

588
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,119
(Chris) <i>Wow, Hughes was sensational, Arlo.</i>

589
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,330
- <i>After being benched earlier this season...</i>
- (chanting) AFC Richmond!

590
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,541
- AFC Richmond!
- (Chris) <i>...back in the starting lineup,</i>

591
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,918
<i>and today, the Welshman played
like a man reborn.</i>

592
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,505
(players cheering)

593
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:05,925
A goal down, a man down,

594
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,511
the Greyhounds scored twice
in the second half.

595
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:11,514
Both assisted by an inspired Colin Hughes.

596
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:17,395
{\an8}But the real fireworks were at halftime
when Richmond's captain, Isaac McAdoo,

597
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:21,441
went into the stands
to attack one of their own fans.

598
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,610
In fairness, I wanted to do that
a few times myself, Jeff.

599
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,613
{\an8}Yeah, but you didn't, Clinton, 'cause
you're not a psychopath like McAdoo.

600
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:30,575
{\an8}- Now, George, you don't know what...
- Oh, no... Jeff. Jeff, come on.

601
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:33,953
You do not go into the stands.
I don't care what was said.

602
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:36,999
That is a line you do not cross.

603
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:40,251
And that's why McAdoo wasn't captain
when I was there.

604
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:41,711
'Cause he's not fit for it.

605
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:44,589
I mean, come on.
He makes Roy Kent look like Bambi.

606
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,841
- (all chuckle)
- He's an idiot, isn't he? Come on.

607
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,467
<i>- McAdoo doing that.
- Yes.</i>

608
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,553
<i>- What was he thinking?
- He's in big trouble.</i>

609
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:52,305
Guy probably deserved it though, right?

610
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,639
- Absolutely.
- No doubt.

611
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,767
I hope his kids shiv him in his sleep.

612
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:58,644
What? He used to come in here.

613
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,771
He was a dick to my niece, Claire, once.

614
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,315
- No way.
- Not Claire.

615
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:03,941
Fucking prick!

616
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:05,401
<i>Moving over to east London,</i>

617
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:08,738
<i>the Wonder Kid's West Ham
took care of business at home.</i>

618
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:11,450
- (club music playing)
- (patrons chattering)

619
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:17,079
(Rupert chuckles) And then...
And then he... he came in after me.

620
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,539
(person chuckles)

621
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,124
Hey, Rupert.

622
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,002
- You all right?
- Hey, Nathan.

623
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:26,422
Let me introduce, uh,
Kelsie and, uh, Libby.

624
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:27,882
- No. (stutters) The other way around.
- Uh...

625
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:29,217
- Oh. (chuckles)
- The other way.

626
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:30,760
(Rupert, Libby, Kelsie chuckling)

627
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,970
Well, I'm still Rupert. (chuckles)

628
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:36,349
And this is Nathan Shelley,
the Wonder Kid.

629
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,893
(chuckles) Hey, you all right?

630
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,519
- Hi.
- Hey.

631
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,522
So, uh, the girls
will be joining us tonight.

632
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:43,607
Shall we?

633
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:49,321
Ooh. Yum, yum, yum.

634
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,366
- Thought it was a guys' night, Rupert.
- Ooh.

635
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:56,286
Well, yes. Trust me, it is.

636
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:01,124
Oscar.
(distorted) We're off to the private room.

637
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,005
Couple of bottles of champagne, please.

638
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:12,928
Um, actually, Rupert.

639
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,680
I'm so sorry, uh, I need to leave.

640
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:19,600
Um, long story.

641
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,395
I wanted to come and tell you in person.

642
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,449
Ooh.

643
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,869
Congratulations, Ted.
That's eight wins in a row.

644
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,953
Oh, come on now, Trent.

645
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:40,831
You know I don't care
about winning or losing.

646
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,207
- (blows raspberry)
- (scoffs)

647
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,084
No, the truth is,
only way I could be happier

648
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:48,171
is if my arm-feet were covered
in barbecue sauce. (chuckles)

649
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,339
How you feeling about the win streak, Roy?

650
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,385
(groans) No way.
Do not come near me with that shit.

651
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,888
- You never talk about a streak.
- Um. Mmm.

652
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,891
My grandparents were happily married
for 51 years

653
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:02,853
'cause they never said a fucking word
to each other. Scram.

654
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:06,063
Well done, gentlemen. Congrats.

655
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,316
Mmm.

656
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,317
Another one.

657
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:12,987
Oh, boy. Higgins hitting us
with his DJ Khaled impression. Nice.

658
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:13,947
Who?

659
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:16,199
- Parallel thinking.
- Apparently so.

660
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,701
The press is ready for you, Ted.
It's a big one.

661
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:21,204
Mmm. That's what that lady
from the American <i>Office</i> said.

662
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:23,164
Okay, I'll be right there.

663
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:24,499
Okay.

664
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,375
(Ted) Mmm.

665
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:29,129
(reporters chattering)

666
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,800
- He's on his way.
- Thank you, Leslie.

667
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,261
You gave Ted some talking points?

668
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:39,264
No. I haven't done that in a long time.

669
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,808
Oh, God.

670
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:50,526
(stammers)

671
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:55,863
(Roy grunts)

672
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:57,741
(chattering stops)

673
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:01,828
{\an8}Yeah. All right. (sighs) You got me today.

674
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:04,372
Any questions?

675
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,332
(reporters clamoring)

676
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,501
Fucking hell.

677
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:10,795
You. Five-o'clock-shadow head.

678
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:16,592
Coach Kent, do you or the organization
condone what Isaac McAdoo did today?

679
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,344
What a stupid fucking question.

680
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:21,138
- (reporters chuckling)
- (Roy) Course we don't.

681
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:24,642
What Isaac did was awful.
He was lucky he only got a red card.

682
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,353
Okay. So why'd he do it?

683
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:28,856
(chuckles)

684
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:46,039
When I was first coming up
through Sunderland,

685
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,334
there was an old-timer on the team.
Local guy.

686
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,461
He and his wife were about to have
their first kid,

687
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,298
so during training one day,

688
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:58,760
I made a joke that, statistically,
I was probably the real dad.

689
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:04,557
And the boys fell about laughing,
but he went fucking nuts.

690
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:07,894
He battered me. Properly.

691
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:11,607
I had a black eye, chipped tooth,
three broken ribs.

692
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,067
I couldn't play for six games.

693
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,320
He got booted off the team.

694
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:21,074
After that, no club would go near him.

695
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,912
Then in the summer,
after I could breathe again,

696
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,080
I bumped into him in a pub.

697
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:31,210
And I got the chance to say sorry
for my stupid fucking joke.

698
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,424
And he got to tell me... (swallows)

699
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:41,010
- He and his wife had lost the baby...
- (reporters groaning)

700
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,263
A month before all that went down.

701
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:49,853
He hadn't told anyone. Kept it all inside.

702
00:37:56,568 --> 00:38:00,656
{\an8}Look, I get that some people think
if they buy a ticket,

703
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:05,577
{\an8}they've got the right to yell whatever
abusive shit they want at footballers.

704
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:10,832
{\an8}But they're not just footballers.
They're also people.

705
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:17,798
And none of us know
what is going on in each other's lives.

706
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:24,888
{\an8}So for Isaac to do what he did today,

707
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:27,099
{\an8}even though it was wrong...

708
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,061
{\an8}I give him love.

709
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:37,568
{\an8}And as for why he did what he did...

710
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,740
that's none of my fucking business.

711
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,538
- Next question.
- (reporters clamoring)

712
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,330
Yeah, New Trent.

713
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,126
(chuckles)
Uh, Coach, let's talk about Colin Hughes.

714
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:57,212
Yeah, he's a hell of a player
and a great man.

715
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,422
I think we've underused him.

716
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:01,299
- (Marcus) I think you're right.
- Glad we agree.

717
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,843
- I prefer you to Old Trent.
- (reporters chuckling)

718
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:06,470
- (Roy) Next question.
- (reporters clamoring)

719
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:08,724
("All That You Are" playing)

720
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,312
(Roy) You. Goblin King, go.

721
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,152
(doorbell rings)

722
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:34,373
Hey.

723
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:36,335
Hey.

724
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,378
What happened to guys' night?

725
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:46,512
(breathes deeply)

726
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:01,985
(exhales sharply)

727
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:10,994
Hey.

728
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:16,875
You lied to me.

729
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:20,337
For years.

730
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:27,886
What is it about me
that made you think you couldn't tell me?

731
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,974
(stammers)
No, it was nothing to do with you.

732
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,268
(sighs) It was about me.

733
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,231
I was 99% sure that you'd support me.

734
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:44,736
But the 1% chance that you wouldn't
scared the shit out of me.

735
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:54,579
I don't know how you did it.
I can't keep a secret for shit.

736
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,207
I know. Another reason I didn't tell you.

737
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,043
I mean, I hid it from people for years,

738
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:03,630
and the second you find out,
I didn't last a month.

739
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,216
(both chuckle)

740
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:10,762
(chuckles) I'm sorry, bruv.

741
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:15,934
You gonna tell everyone now?

742
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,230
No.

743
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:23,984
The team knows. And that's enough for me.

744
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,528
And no one's gonna say shit.

745
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:30,782
I promise.

746
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:37,873
Hmm. Wanna come in?

747
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:45,464
Yeah, all right.

748
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:47,341
Come on.

749
00:41:47,342 --> 00:41:49,426
("I Am What I Am" playing)

750
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:05,484
(Isaac) Is "top or bottom"
sex positions or sleeping arrangements?

751
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,276
(Colin) Sexual positions.

752
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:09,154
Unless bunk beds are involved.
Then it's both.

753
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,239
Would you ever shag a woman?

754
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,615
No, I'm gay.

755
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:14,701
I know, but what if you had to?

756
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:18,246
- 1967 Raquel Welch.
- My man.

757
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:19,247
(chuckles)

758
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:22,918
- Who's the fittest guy on the team?
- I won't tell you, and you'd never guess.

759
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:25,879
- Bumbercatch.
- Yes.

760
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:29,298
What about team showers?
How does that work?

761
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:31,927
Uh, I keep my head down,
and I think of global warming.

762
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:34,929
Yeah, well, if I had to shower
with a bunch of girls all the time,

763
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,057
- I'd defo get boners.
- (chuckles)

764
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,811
I love you, boyo.

765
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:45,524
You can't say it, can you?

766
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:48,569
No.

767
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,904
But you know I do, yeah?
