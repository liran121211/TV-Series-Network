1
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,861
So remember that the client pays
for the shoot,

2
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,780
but we pay for the overtime.

3
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,658
So whatever you do, don't go over.

4
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,118
But make the commercial
as good as possible too, right?

5
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,664
Um, yeah. Sure. Whatever.

6
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,374
Ooh, and I had an idea.

7
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,960
Maybe we could all have a picnic together
in the conference room?

8
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,837
Um, I can't make it.

9
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,048
- I didn't tell you when it was.
- I know.

10
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:52,719
Oh, come on, Barbara. Could be fun.

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,510
We could get to know each other a little.
Maybe loosen things up around here.

12
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,058
Well, I've worked with this lot before,

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,021
and, um, yeah,
this is as loose as they get.

14
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:13,865
- Hmm. We'll see about that, Babs.
- Oh, no. Don't.

15
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,783
Yep. I felt that as soon as I said it.

16
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,913
All right, I'm headed out.

17
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,583
Everyone have a great day, yeah?

18
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,672
Oi, don't do anything I wouldn't do.

19
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,855
What wouldn't she do?

20
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,754
Good morning, Viet...

21
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,088
Ted!

22
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,549
- Hey, look who's here. Hi, Keeley.
- Hello, Ted.

23
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,052
Whoa! Trent Crimm. Are you kidding me?

24
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,553
Hey, nice to see you, man.

25
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,847
{\an8}You know, they got a big old Ziploc bag
full of your hair ties

26
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,724
{\an8}down at the lost and found.
You should pop on down,

27
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,643
{\an8}if you still want 'em.

28
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:27,230
{\an8}Thank you. Mr. Crimm has requested
to follow the club this year.

29
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,272
Ooh.

30
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,025
- He wants to write a book about us.
- Oh, yeah?

31
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,906
I think there's a story here
worth telling, Ted.

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,072
Yes, and we all love the idea.

33
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,823
But obviously, as manager,

34
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,951
we thought you should have
the final decision.

35
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,829
{\an8}Oh, okay, uh...

36
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,710
{\an8}I mean, geez,
you know, like, um...

37
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,550
No.

38
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:59,095
Whoo.

39
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,473
Sure, what the heck?
Why not? When can you start?

40
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,476
{\an8}No time like the present.
W... Except 11:11. That's my wishing time.

41
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:09,188
{\an8}Or 23:11, if, uh,
I'm at a military base or Euro Disney.

42
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,941
{\an8}- Right, well.
- Decision made.

43
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,944
Wonderful. Trent, welcome.

44
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,905
- Holy shit.
- Uh-oh.

45
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,699
Zava is leaving Juventus.

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,409
Whoa!

47
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,745
{\an8}What about their kids? I'm sorry. I didn't
know what any of those things meant.

48
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,539
{\an8}I thought it was like Greek mythology
or something.

49
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,207
{\an8}I was just lost.
I just went with that. Sorry.

50
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,252
{\an8}Zava's a world-class striker
who's about to leave his club in Italy.

51
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,546
{\an8}Ooh, cacio later, Pepe.

52
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,174
{\an8}Apparently, he wants to play
in the Premier League

53
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:39,760
{\an8}because his wife binged The Office
and she wants to live in England.

54
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,846
Ooh, I think you mean Scranton,
Pennsylvania, buddy.

55
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,639
No, the British Office, Ted.

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,892
Oh, that's right.
Y'all did a premake over here.

57
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,810
If we got Zava, that would be amazing.

58
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,897
{\an8}He would be huge for the club's brand.
He's got like 90 million followers.

59
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,482
{\an8}One time he just
posted the word "7 million likes."

60
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,775
{\an8}It got 10 million likes.

61
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,404
{\an8}Yes, but he is very expensive. And isn't
he supposed to be a bit of a diva?

62
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,073
{\an8}Yes, huge diva. Enormous.

63
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,868
{\an8}He goes through teams like you
go through manicurists.

64
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,413
{\an8}The fumes make me dizzy, and I overshare.

65
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,873
{\an8}Please don't print that.

66
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,918
{\an8}Zava has played for 14 teams in 15 years,

67
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,212
{\an8}leaving behind nothing
but chaos and trophies.

68
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,506
{\an8}Beautiful, shiny trophies.

69
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,384
{\an8}Yes, but, Leslie,
who wants to deal with all that drama?

70
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,553
{\an8}Apparently, everyone who can afford him.

71
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,098
{\an8}Chelsea, Arsenal, United, West Ham.

72
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,391
I say, let's just go for it.

73
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,021
I mean, maybe he's a handful,
but who doesn't love a handful?

74
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,023
{\an8}I mean, if you're talking salted peanuts,
yes, please.

75
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,733
{\an8}If you're talking Skittles though,
no, thank you.

76
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,860
You know, the dye melts,
and it gets all over your fingers,

77
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,195
makes 'em all sticky.

78
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,697
And that, you can print.

79
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,077
- Wonderful. Let's set up a meeting.
- Great.

80
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,162
- Let's go and get Zava.
- Yes!

81
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,747
- We're doing it.
- Zava dabba doo!

82
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,082
Yeah.

83
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,875
Here we go. Yeah, come on.

84
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,252
This is exciting.

85
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,462
So, am I to assume
that you're going to pursue

86
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:00,174
{\an8}a notoriously mercurial player
you can't really afford simply

87
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,511
{\an8}because the team your ex-husband
owns wants him?

88
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,974
No, no, no, no, no.

89
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,601
Yes.

90
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,230
Love that.

91
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,237
So, hey, come on. Talk to me.

92
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,323
What's it like being the boss
of your own Keeley Street Band, huh?

93
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,117
- Oh, I think it's going really good.
- Yeah?

94
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,451
{\an8}- Yeah.
- Good, good.

95
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,788
{\an8}Well, I do wish that my co-workers
would loosen up just a little bit.

96
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,624
- Mmm. You want my advice?
- Yes.

97
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,668
Y'all should go out
and do something together.

98
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,295
You know, like outside of work.

99
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,921
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah, yeah.

100
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,841
{\an8}Ooh, like,
maybe I could hire a shaman

101
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,720
{\an8}and we could do a bunch
of ayahuasca under a blood moon.

102
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,805
{\an8}I-I was thinking something
like an escape room,

103
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,557
but, hey, Clamato Clamato, right?

104
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,767
- Yeah. Thanks, Ted.
- Good to see you. Yeah.

105
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,102
- Keeley!
- Yeah?

106
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,896
Isaac. Hi. You all right?

107
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,939
Yeah. Can you help me get a shoe deal?

108
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,984
Oh, I'd love to. Any brand in particular?

109
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:04,031
{\an8}No brands.
Just shoes, in general. You know.

110
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,367
{\an8}Great. I'll look into it for you.

111
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,580
{\an8}- Hi, guys.
- Keeley.

112
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,040
{\an8}Hi, Keeley.

113
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,707
{\an8}- Hi, Jamie.
- How you doing? You good, yeah?

114
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,292
Yeah, I'm all right. You?

115
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:20,296
Yeah, yeah. Not... Not bad.
Yeah, yeah. Um, g-gym.

116
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,299
- Just went to the gym. So, yeah. Good.
- Good.

117
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,094
Uh... Glad you're good.
Um, I'll see you later.

118
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,514
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Bye.

119
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,768
- Bruv.
- What's up, man?

120
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,775
Whoa. Keeley and Roy have broken up.

121
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,361
What? Who told you that?

122
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,781
It's not "who," bruv.
It's "what." Kinesics.

123
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,367
Study of body language. Just look at 'em.

124
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,537
No eye contact, Keeley's crossed arms.

125
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:57,209
Roy's clenched arse. It's science.

126
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,281
- What do you want?
- You and Keeley break up?

127
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,033
- Who told you that?
- No one.

128
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,869
I use body science.

129
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,872
Why? Is it true?

130
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:41,878
Hmm.

131
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,130
What's that fucking face?

132
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,592
It's called empathy, you dusty, old fart.

133
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:51,388
Look, as someone who's been dumped
by Keeley, I get it.

134
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:56,058
- She didn't dump me.
- You dumped her? Why?

135
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,978
I don't want to talk about it.
Why'd you come in here?

136
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,688
Oh, let me guess.

137
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,940
You want to know if it's okay
to ask her out, right?

138
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:07,946
No, I was just...
I was just seeing if you were okay, man.

139
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,326
Dickhead.

140
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,785
- What the fuck you doing?
- I was gonna hug you.

141
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,914
- Well, you came at me too fast.
- Jesus, sorry.

142
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,918
I forget how skittish elderly people
could be 'cause of the war.

143
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,586
Come on, man.
I was just trying to comfort you.

144
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,213
Well, I don't want comfort.

145
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,256
And I told you,
I don't want to talk about it.

146
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,925
So don't you say a fucking word.
Do you hear me?

147
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,469
Fine, I won't.

148
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,721
And don't you say a fucking word
about it either, William.

149
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,098
I... No, no, I won't.

150
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,392
I... I actually just went through a bit
of a breakup myself,

151
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,269
so I can somewhat relate.

152
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,022
Um, hey,
maybe we should all go out sometime.

153
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,358
Us three. You know, get a couple drinks,
couple pints, couple shots.

154
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,028
- Fishbowls.
- Single guys club.

155
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,406
Or I can just not say a fucking word.

156
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,450
No, I hear you. I hear you loud and clear.

157
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,077
Well, you are a sleepwalker.

158
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,163
I don't know what else to tell you. Period.

159
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,251
Hey, Coach.

160
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,420
What are you doing?

161
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,172
Oh, just taking a peek at one

162
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,759
of these soccer strategy books you always
got your nose in.

163
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,389
What do you think?

164
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,891
Well, given the struggles I've already had
with the table of contents,

165
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,518
I think I might be best served to wait

166
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,063
until this son of a gun
comes out as a movie.

167
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,691
Hey, let me ask you a couple questions.

168
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,234
One, what would you think if we sign Zava?

169
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,736
Ooh. That's good, right?

170
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,405
- Zava? Yeah.
- Okay.

171
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,074
Second question. Who is Zava?

172
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,244
He's a living legend.
You know who Zava is.

173
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,163
Mmm, beg to differ, Claudia Schiffer.

174
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,093
Now why you got me
watching the Veggie Dog Vigilante here?

175
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:54,803
{\an8}<i>Hey. Whoa.</i>

176
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,139
{\an8}No way.

177
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,433
{\an8}Because that's Zava.

178
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,227
That's Zava?

179
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,354
{\an8}Well, shoot.
I didn't know this fella played football.

180
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,482
Hey, I said football
without even thinking about it.

181
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,651
Boy, that book really works.

182
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,029
Ooh.

183
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,616
Ooh, 11:11. Make a wish.

184
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,371
- What'd you wish for? Oh, come on, Coach.
- I can't tell you that.

185
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,165
I just don't want our wishes
to cancel each other out.

186
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,417
- That's not how it works.
- Shut the fuck up.

187
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,294
- Take it back.
- Uh-oh, now what?

188
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,337
Take it back.

189
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,088
I can't take back things
that's already happened.

190
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,549
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Fellas, what's wrong?

191
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,636
Coach,
w-we just heard the most upsetting rumor.

192
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,429
- Okay, is this about us getting Zava?
- Huh?

193
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,139
- What?
- We're getting Zava?

194
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,477
I just wished for that 30 seconds ago.

195
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,149
Whoa, whoa, wait, no, whoa, whoa.

196
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,442
Hold on a second, okay?

197
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,861
If y'all weren't talking about Zava,
what were you so upset about?

198
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,905
Is it 'cause Trent Crimm's
writing a book about us?

199
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,907
What?

200
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,409
Wait, Trent Crimm's writing a book
about Zava joining our team?

201
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,204
No, no. He's just coming here
to write a book about the team.

202
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,705
Zava's writing a book about us?

203
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,165
No, Trent Crimm.

204
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,127
Why would Zava write a book
about Trent Crimm?

205
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,591
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop!
Okay, hold on a second.

206
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,262
If y'all didn't know about Zava,
which may or may not happen,

207
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,056
and y'all didn't know about Trent Crimm,
which is happening,

208
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,393
then what were you so worked up about?

209
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,689
Roy and Keeley broke up.

210
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,608
Whoa, Coach.

211
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,027
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sorry, no, I'm okay.

212
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,113
Got a little light-headed there.
Yeah, thank you.

213
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,365
Fuck's going on?

214
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,869
- Aw.
- Tartt!

215
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,579
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I didn't say anything.

216
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,330
I will fucking kill you.

217
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,708
No, I came in, and they was talking
about us getting Zava.

218
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:52,420
What? We're getting Zava?

219
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,798
Roy, do you want to talk about it?

220
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,134
No, I'm not talking about me and Keeley.

221
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,469
No, I meant Zava.
Do you want to talk about it?

222
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,014
Sure, he's nuts,
but he'll help us win games.

223
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:05,141
That time I was actually talking
about you and Keeley.

224
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,560
- Fuck's sake.
- Hey, uh, Will, come here a sec.

225
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,062
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm here.
- Hey.

226
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,439
I need you to run to my apartment,
go into my desk,

227
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,317
and grab my CD
called "Ted's breakup mix." Okay?

228
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:15,860
- Got it. What's a CD?
- Okay.

229
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,570
- Oh, boy.
- On it.

230
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,113
Hey, Coach, you gonna need my keys.

231
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,908
- I got a set.
- Right.

232
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,284
- Thanks. Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

233
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,704
Hey, Roy, look, we're here for you. Okay?

234
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,040
We've all been dumped before,
right, fellas?

235
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,043
She didn't dump me. I broke up with her.

236
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,838
What?

237
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,673
This day couldn't get any worse.

238
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,509
And this is the locker room. Hello, boys.

239
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,386
- I believe you all know Trent Crimm.
- Gentlemen.

240
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,096
The fuck is this prick doing here?

241
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,265
Trent's writing a book about our season,

242
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,852
so let's welcome him with open arms
and open minds.

243
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,481
Absolutely. Yes.

244
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:57,069
Oi! Listen up!

245
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:01,865
No one says a fucking word
around this prick

246
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,827
unless they want my forehead
through their fucking skull!

247
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,290
Don't worry.

248
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,672
Okay, well, um...

249
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,384
we'll work out the specifics later.

250
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:24,096
Um, but until then, welcome,
Trent.

251
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,223
Whoo!

252
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,104
I mean, fuck off, Trent Crimm.

253
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:58,546
And cut! Thank you, folks. Moving on.

254
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:03,092
Okay. Now the lamb chugs
a Cafka mini and poof,

255
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,636
turns into a smoking hot lion.

256
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:09,098
Great, b-but we can't actually
make the lamb drink the Cafka mini, right?

257
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,225
- No, of course not.
- Okay, good.

258
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:15,062
We were told by the people
in the lab, the lamb cannot drink it.

259
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,690
Yeah, no, it will die instantly.

260
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,151
- Something about enzymes.
- Hmm.

261
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,069
I totally get it.

262
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:25,072
- I just don't think she does.
- No. I don't think she got it.

263
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,825
Keeley fucking Jones.

264
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,078
Shandy fucking Fine?

265
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,833
Oh, my God!
I didn't know you were doing this.

266
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,002
I didn't know you owned a skirt
that covered your whole arse.

267
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,087
Oi, you borrowed
and never returned many of those skirts.

268
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,088
And I never will.

269
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,090
One of the perks of living
with you and the girls.

270
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,052
- Oh, the girls! How are they? How's Chloe?
- Uh, married a footballer.

271
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,012
- And Emma?
- Married a footballer.

272
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,222
And what about you?

273
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,265
Married a footballer,
divorced a footballer.

274
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,684
And now I'm back here doing this.

275
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:56,271
But enough about me.
I saw you in Vanity Fair.

276
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:59,399
Fully clothed. And I cried.

277
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,568
I'm so proud of you, babe. We all are.

278
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,779
Proud of me? Why?

279
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,116
'Cause you made it out
all by yourself.

280
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,788
What is that smell?

281
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,415
Oh, apologies, uh, lamb droppings

282
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,418
are one of nature's
most unpleasant aromas.

283
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,297
Just be grateful Clarice here
is over 30 days old.

284
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:26,759
A week ago, her poop
looked like sour, yellow toothpaste.

285
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,887
Ugh!

286
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,055
Oh, no, no. Don't try and sweep it.

287
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,851
No, you gotta pick it up like sushi
or it'll smear.

288
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:36,427
I was married to a footballer.

289
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,230
That's it. Cheers, babe.

290
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,232
- Hey, Keeley.
- Yes?

291
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,901
Jimmy and I think
the club feels too empty.

292
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,528
Yeah, it should feel totally packed.

293
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:48,282
I mean, can we get maybe
another 100 extras?

294
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,825
- A hundred more, right now?
- Mmm.

295
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:52,244
- Yeah.
- Um...

296
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,662
You could just add a strobe effect
to the post

297
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,789
and let people cross close to camera.

298
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,999
It'll feel really packed,

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,835
and you won't have
to spend any more money.

300
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,295
- I love that.
- Let's do that.

301
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,672
Thank you so much.

302
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,842
Look at you. Basically running the shoot.

303
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,928
Oh, maybe one day I'll make it out
like you did.

304
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:12,890
Yeah.

305
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:17,768
Hello, Mother.

306
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,814
Oh, my God, darling...
I'm so pleased to hear your voice.

307
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,317
<i>I dreamt last night
that you'd been murdered.</i>

308
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,236
No, still here.

309
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,071
<i>Wait, why are you in a hotel room?</i>

310
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,365
<i>I thought you were meant
to be on some three-day,</i>

311
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,909
<i>spiritual camping retreat.</i>

312
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,870
I am. I'm not sleeping out there.

313
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,581
<i>Far too many stars.</i>

314
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:41,834
I keep thinking they're all staring at me,
you know.

315
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,212
<i>No, but listen.
I've got some exciting news for you.</i>

316
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,172
I spoke to Tish the other day,

317
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,925
and she's agreed
to consider meeting with you.

318
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,344
Wow! Your psychic has actually agreed

319
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:55,223
to let me pay her a lot of money
to speak with her? Amazing.

320
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,975
<i>N... Well, no. She's considering it.</i>

321
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,895
<i>But I think you meeting
with Tish would be perfect because,</i>

322
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:05,149
<i>well, you know, you are in desperate need
of some maternal guidance.</i>

323
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,275
<i>Just a minute.</i>

324
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:09,278
<i>There's a group of people
gathering outside for scream therapy,</i>

325
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,489
which is my favorite bit.

326
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,908
<i>So I'd better go now
because I mustn't use my voice.</i>

327
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,203
- Bye-bye, sausage.
- But you called me.

328
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,329
I have an update on the meeting with Zava.

329
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,373
Oh, great.

330
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:23,251
- Zava doesn't want to meet with us.
- What? Why not?

331
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,794
Uh, his people said,

332
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:28,715
"It would be a waste of time
for us and an embarrassment for him."

333
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,009
Oh, that feels like
an unnecessarily cruel response.

334
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,471
But, good news,
Zava is signing with Chelsea.

335
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,889
W-Why is that good news?

336
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,558
Because he's not signing with West Ham.

337
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,269
He came right out and said,
"I will not sign with West Ham."

338
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,980
Oh, shit. That's only going
to make Rupert want him more.

339
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,606
Uh, there's nothing Rupert can do.

340
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,732
Oh, great. Now you've jinxed it.

341
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,609
- But I thi...
- No, it's too late. Jinxed it.

342
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,112
- But I do think that...
- It's done.

343
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,990
- Well done.
- Oh.

344
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:58,662
Afternoon.

345
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,295
Hi.

346
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,796
Ah, Jamie.

347
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:13,302
Ah, no. No.

348
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,190
Looking good out there today.

349
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,740
Cool.

350
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,393
Ah.
Thanks for sharing your office with me.

351
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,605
Even if it was Ted's idea.

352
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,017
So, Richmond against Chelsea?

353
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,563
That will be your first time back there
since you retired. Right?

354
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,318
Right.

355
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,032
Sorry.

356
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,662
- Yeah, it's my publisher.
- I'll be quick.

357
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:08,583
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no. Well, I-I'm here now.

358
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,585
It's going very well, actually.

359
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,795
I'm just getting settled in.

360
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:16,424
Um, yes. Everyone's been, um...

361
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,052
very welcom...
welcoming.

362
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:23,306
Yeah. No, I can hear that, um...
that noise too.

363
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,976
Uh, I'm not sure if that's my...
Is that me or you?

364
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,061
- I... Do you know what?
- Bear with me. One moment.

365
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,024
I'll, uh, I'll take this outside.

366
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,949
- Is this right?
- It is.

367
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:46,078
Uh, yes.
Your company credit card arrived.

368
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,371
Awesome. Thank you.

369
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,708
- Do not use it.
- Okay.

370
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,127
Barbara, I would love
for you to meet Shandy.

371
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:54,921
- Hi.
- Oh, hello. Hi.

372
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,548
She's the newest member of KJPR.

373
00:20:57,216 --> 00:21:02,846
Oh. Um, what position
has she been hired for?

374
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,767
She will be consulting

375
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:13,023
for affiliate management

376
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,400
and...

377
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:19,529
- client relationships.
- Yeah.

378
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,239
Okay.

379
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,866
Would you have a-a seat, uh, Shandy?
Shandy, is it?

380
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,868
- Yeah. Sorry.
- So, uh, when I p...

381
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,371
Just... Yeah, just put it in there.
Put the sweet in there.

382
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:34,168
Um, well, I'd love to know
what experience you have in these areas.

383
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,838
- Uh, in relationships, tons.
- Mmm.

384
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,842
The rest of it, not much.

385
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,472
And where did you go to university?

386
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:49,642
- I didn't go university.
- Didn't go?

387
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,144
- No.
- Okay.

388
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:54,605
And what were you doing right before this?

389
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,649
I was modeling.

390
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,486
Yeah. Okay, thanks, Shandy.

391
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,737
All right. I think I've got it.

392
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,408
So you've hired a former model
with no previous experience,

393
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:09,538
no higher education for a job
that doesn't exist. Lovely.

394
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:16,086
Well, welcome to the team, Shandy.

395
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,601
I'm so sorry. I'll handle this.

396
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,904
Barbara, I need a minute to talk with you.

397
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:48,827
The way you just treated Shandy
was incredibly rude. It was hurtful.

398
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,624
- What?
- That is a massive amount of snow globes.

399
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,044
Oh, yeah. I-I collect them.

400
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,339
Well, you know, the firm sends me
from, um, company to company,

401
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,468
and yeah, wherever I go, I just, uh,
buy a snow globe.

402
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,928
It's a little bit silly, really.

403
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,765
No, I think it's incredibly charming.

404
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:19,191
You cannot speak to people like that.
Not here.

405
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,236
I know Shandy's my friend,
and you're right.

406
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:28,867
She does not have the experience. But she
is smart. She's eager. I believe in her.

407
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,578
Like the firm must believe in you

408
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,416
to send you all over the world
to all those lovely places, right?

409
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,884
Maybe you and I can see how good it feels
to believe in someone else.

410
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:48,470
Together. Yeah?

411
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,222
Mm-hmm.

412
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:57,145
Client relations coordinator.

413
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,523
- Huh?
- That's her title.

414
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:05,862
Oh, good. Yes.
Just in case you hadn't realized,

415
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:08,407
I totally made up
that one I told you before.

416
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:13,245
Hello. Hi.

417
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:18,165
- Roy.
- No.

418
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,459
I understand your hesitation
having me here.

419
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,338
You're protective of the team,
and I admire how much they respect you.

420
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:27,049
It's not easy getting such fulfillment
from a second career.

421
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,552
I'm not sure I even got it from my first.

422
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:33,891
Maybe you could just give me a chance.

423
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,645
Fuck off.

424
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,568
Wow, okay.

425
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:53,242
{\an8}A new season begins
and hope springs eternal,

426
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:56,370
<i>except perhaps for AFC Richmond.</i>

427
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,207
<i>They return to the Premier League
after a one-year absence</i>

428
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:02,794
<i>but are widely expected to have
a rather short stay.</i>

429
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:06,797
Worse yet, their campaign begins here
at Stamford Bridge,

430
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,134
the home of the formidable
Chelsea Football Club.

431
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,636
To be promoted to the Premier League

432
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:14,014
is like going from a council estate
to the penthouse, Arlo.

433
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,349
<i>Richmond should enjoy it while it lasts.</i>

434
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,893
Gentlemen,
welcome back to the Premier League.

435
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,562
Ah, back where we belong. Pip pip.

436
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:25,025
Feels like we never left.

437
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:26,610
Here you go, lads.

438
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,487
Uh, Mae. I got the fish and chips.

439
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:30,697
I had the burger.

440
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,619
It's good to be back.

441
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,501
How's work? How's your friend doing?

442
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:45,253
- Shandy? Yeah, she's doing great.
- Mmm.

443
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:47,422
- Mmm. Good.
- Yeah.

444
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,176
She's just full of ideas.

445
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,636
- Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.
- Uh-oh.

446
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:55,848
- Thank you. Sorry. Excuse me.
- Any news?

447
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,349
Zava and Chelsea are pretty much
a done deal.

448
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,644
I have the confirmation
of that from a very reliable source.

449
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:02,770
Oh, what source?

450
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,897
A friend of my wife knows an agent

451
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:08,442
whose masseuse moonlights
as an airline steward on private jets.

452
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,528
Now... she wasn't working today,

453
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,905
but her coworker who can read lips,

454
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:16,742
he saw Zava mouth the word "Chelsea"
a lot.

455
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,744
- God, I wish I could read lips.
- Yeah.

456
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,664
Okay. Has anyone seen Rupert?
Is there any sign of him?

457
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:26,919
No, Rebecca. He's not here. And even
if he was, there's nothing he can do.

458
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,547
Oh, great. Jinxed it again.

459
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,388
Fuck you, you old geezer.

460
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:41,601
- Hello, Roy. Welcome back.
- How you doing, mate?

461
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,521
Uh, heard the news. Mmm.

462
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:47,023
I broke up with her.

463
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:49,484
Why? I mean,
you guys were perfect together.

464
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,569
Fuckin' Bruce.

465
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,987
Oi, that's Roy Kent.

466
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:55,073
- Roy!
- Roy Kent!

467
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:57,116
We love you, Roy!

468
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,660
He's here, he's there,
he's every fucking where,

469
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:01,871
Roy Kent! Roy Kent!

470
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:04,498
He's here, he's there,
he's every fucking where,

471
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:10,047
Roy Kent, Roy Kent! He's here...

472
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,132
{\an8}Now that's a lovely moment.

473
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,885
{\an8}<i>Chelsea fans letting
their former captain, Roy Kent,</i>

474
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:17,888
{\an8}<i>know how they still feel about him.</i>

475
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,517
Roy Kent, Roy Kent!

476
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:24,852
He's here, he's there,
he's every fucking where,

477
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:28,023
{\an8}Roy Kent, Roy Kent...

478
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,622
- Thank you.
- Oh, my gosh. Is that Zava?

479
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:45,873
There he is.

480
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,292
Look, it's Zava.

481
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,752
- Oh.
- Zava! Zava! Zava!

482
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,838
And the great Zava
makes his appearance.

483
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,550
<i>Will he be signing for Chelsea today?
What are you hearing, Chris?</i>

484
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:57,260
Oh, all sorts of things.

485
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:00,931
<i>The crowd, your voice, a slight ringing
because I bumped my head earlier.</i>

486
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,309
Holy...

487
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,564
- Jamie.
- What?

488
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,399
It's Zava.

489
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,150
- So what, man?
- My heart is racing.

490
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,027
I haven't been this nervous
to play in front of someone

491
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,947
since I was in El Chapo's youth league.

492
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:18,656
Move, man.

493
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,868
Oh, my God. I cannot believe it.

494
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,121
Wow, we're in the same city as Zava.

495
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:26,748
Thank God we dressed up.

496
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,529
{\an8}The players are in position,
awaiting the referee's whistle.

497
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,383
{\an8}And we're off. Another season begins.

498
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,183
Leslie, will you pull yourself together?

499
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,940
Hughes tries for Todd,
but Chelsea intercepts.

500
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,818
<i>The Greyhounds
are in massive jeopardy now.</i>

501
00:28:55,819 --> 00:29:00,616
<i>Oh, some invention.
Look at that pace. High-pressure football.</i>

502
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,409
- And Chelsea on the board...
- Fuck!

503
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,911
- With beautiful counterattack...
- Shit.

504
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,037
<i>Against a reeling Richmond.</i>

505
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,956
No!

506
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,832
Absolutely devastating.

507
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:13,044
Take off those fucking hats.
They're bad luck.

508
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:15,213
Same old shit.

509
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:17,131
- The ref blows his whistle...
- It's all right.

510
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:20,426
<i>For the conclusion of the first half,
and it's Chelsea 1, Richmond nil.</i>

511
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,764
You have to give Richmond credit
for hanging on as long as they did, Arlo.

512
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,393
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Yeah.

513
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:34,149
What now?

514
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,443
I might've jinxed it.

515
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,572
I knew it.

516
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:44,158
Would you please go and find out
as much as you can

517
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,911
from your vast network
of lip-reading massage therapists?

518
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,664
Okay. Pardon me. Excuse me.

519
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:51,083
Excuse me. Pardon me.

520
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,088
- Rupert's gonna land Zava.
- You don't know that.

521
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,342
Years ago, when I was bartending
in that private club,

522
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:04,262
Rupert and his then wife came
into the bar.

523
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:06,472
He was the life and soul of the party.

524
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:11,936
Buying rounds of drinks for everyone,
telling stories. Just charm personified.

525
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:14,897
And he left me a massive tip.
And then about a week later,

526
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:18,901
he came back without his wife
and asked me out.

527
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:22,489
- I, of course, said no. Then he left.
- What a dick.

528
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:26,617
But then he came back the next night
and the next night and the next.

529
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,202
And he would just sit at the bar

530
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:31,832
with a drink
and chatted to me until close.

531
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,877
And he just said, "It doesn't matter
if you ever go out with me.

532
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:38,338
It's just worth it being here
to get to know you."

533
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:42,133
It's a fine line
between stalking and romance.

534
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:47,556
Mmm. And after about six weeks of that,
he asked me out again.

535
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:52,518
And I said yes without any hesitation.

536
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,437
Because by that point...

537
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:57,816
I just felt so lucky
because he wanted me.

538
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,654
He made me feel special. Chosen.

539
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,326
He made me feel like that.

540
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,421
Hmm.

541
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,343
Hey, fellas. Listen up.

542
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,553
We get one goal,
we're right back in this thing, yeah?

543
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:29,388
But right now,
we are being so unoffensive,

544
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,683
we might as well be a Hallmark Christmas
movie, you know what I'm saying?

545
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:33,768
- What?
- What's that?

546
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,686
I mean, Coach,
how many shots on goal we have that half?

547
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,021
- One.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

548
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,815
And that one was pretty much a mistake.
Am I correct, Dani?

549
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:43,111
Yes, it bounced off my face.
But my face almost scored.

550
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:46,489
Yes, it was close.

551
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,157
- Coach.
- Yeah, Jamie.

552
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,325
- One idea.
- What you got?

553
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:52,166
Right, so every time they're going past
the halfway line, they're just...

554
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:04,132
Trent, hold on a second.

555
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:07,261
Roy, can I speak with you?

556
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,561
Oi, what the fuck's
a Hallmark Christmas movie?

557
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:19,106
Hey, look, man, I don't know
what your beef is with Trent,

558
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,983
but I'm gonna need you to order off
the vegan menu right now and squash it.

559
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,570
'Cause your ego's about to sabotage

560
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,573
a whole lot more
than a silly football match.

561
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,701
You feel me?

562
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:34,121
Thank you.

563
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,457
And Hallmark Christmas movies
are films that feature women

564
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,043
from the big city falling in love
with their childhood crushes.

565
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:43,671
It's usually some fella
that owns a Christmas tree farm.

566
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,049
Sometimes he's also Santa Claus
or a prince.

567
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:48,718
They suck, but they're great.

568
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,345
But they also mostly suck.

569
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,222
But they're also kinda great.

570
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,391
They're good with the sound off.

571
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,728
Now go fix this, please.

572
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,946
Crimm!

573
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:25,421
It's actually quite funny

574
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,257
when he yells at other people, innit?

575
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:44,942
Hold this.

576
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:58,830
"Newcomer Roy Kent is an overhyped,
so-called prodigy

577
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,960
whose unbridled rage and mediocre talent

578
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:09,424
rendered his Premier League debut
a profound disappointment."

579
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:14,263
Do you know who wrote that?

580
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:17,683
I was 17 years old.

581
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,103
This fucking wrecked me.

582
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,065
I thought I was being edgy.

583
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:29,694
I was just trying to make a name
for myself.

584
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:34,992
All I really did was, uh,
look for the worst in people. I'm sorry.

585
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,496
It's all right.

586
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,416
Give me that.

587
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,254
You know, it's funny.

588
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,048
- We had a lot in common back then.
- We did?

589
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:53,552
We both thought one another
sucked shit at their job.

590
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:56,847
And now look at us.

591
00:34:58,682 --> 00:34:59,725
- Go.
- Yeah.

592
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,191
Oi.

593
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:12,278
- You can talk around this prick now.
- Oh.

594
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,030
Oi. Hold on, yo, yo, Jamie.
What were you saying?

595
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:17,116
Yeah, man. Listen. What I'm saying is,
every time we go past halfway,

596
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,702
they're just blocking up
the passing lanes, you get that?

597
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,579
Yes, yes. That's right.
They're not marking us.

598
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,122
So just keep dribbling
until they stop you.

599
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:26,584
Exactly! Let's take it all the way
and fucking win this.

600
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:28,295
Yes! Yeah!

601
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,508
Thank you, thank you.

602
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:34,759
Well?

603
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,053
I just got off the phone
with my son's karate teacher,

604
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:40,223
who used to date the woman
who ran Zava's avocado farm...

605
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:44,018
- Oh, would you please get on with it?
- He might be going to West Ham.

606
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,521
- Shit.
- I knew it.

607
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,899
Rupert always gets what he wants.

608
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:56,156
You know what?

609
00:35:57,282 --> 00:36:00,535
If Rupert can sweet-talk Zava
into joining his club, then so can I.

610
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,495
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

611
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:03,871
- Oh!
- Thank you. Sorry.

612
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,414
And we're back for the second half.

613
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:08,835
<i>Chris, do you think either of these teams
made any adjustments in the locker rooms?</i>

614
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,753
Oh, I'm sure they did, Arlo.

615
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:13,924
<i>But professional athletes don't mind
adjusting themselves in public either.</i>

616
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:21,138
Ah, hello there.
Rebecca Welton, AFC Richmond.

617
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,224
I'd love to see Zava. Thank you.

618
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:25,185
No one gets in to see Zava.

619
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,021
- I just saw Mr. Mannion...
- Rebecca, my dear.

620
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:33,110
- Rupert. What a lovely surprise.
- Yeah.

621
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,239
- There you go, Mr. Mannion.
- Thank you, Matthew.

622
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:41,868
Oh. Congratulations, by the way,
on the win against Leicester yesterday.

623
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:46,372
Thank you. Yeah. We are so lucky
to have a manager like Nathan.

624
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:51,128
He's a gaffer who really understands
the game. Such an advantage.

625
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,090
- Ah, Zava.
- Ah.

626
00:36:56,091 --> 00:37:00,012
Let me introduce Rebecca Welton.
My ex-wife.

627
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,430
And the owner of AFC Richmond.

628
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:03,640
Yeah, of course.

629
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:06,226
It's an honor for you to meet me.

630
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:09,146
See you soon.

631
00:37:09,147 --> 00:37:10,397
Can't wait.

632
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,578
He will look so great
in claret and blue. Hmm.

633
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,749
You know, Rupert,
I was a little bit surprised

634
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,792
when you bought West Ham.

635
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,629
I always thought that Richmond
was your one true love.

636
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:40,469
Oh. Guess I'm just like any man. Just
get bored with the same old, same old.

637
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:45,015
Good luck with this season.

638
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:15,879
You are such a fucking chickenshit.

639
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:20,925
I mean, if you were great, truly great,
you could play anywhere.

640
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:25,179
But instead you choose a club
like West Ham, because it's big and shiny,

641
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,766
and you know that they'll win
whether you're there or not.

642
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:30,226
And you'll never have to wonder

643
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:33,021
if you're still as good as you tell
everyone you are.

644
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,945
But you and I know that you're not.
You're overrated. You're overpaid.

645
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:45,409
And you eat too much fucking asparagus.

646
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:54,500
Richmond's defending
has kept them in this match,

647
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:56,836
<i>and they are one moment
of inspiration away</i>

648
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:59,422
<i>from going home with an unlikely point.</i>

649
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:02,383
<i>Well, Chelsea giving Hughes space.</i>

650
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:05,052
If they're going to
give him space, he's going to take it.

651
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:08,015
Possibilities here. Hughes has options.

652
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:09,974
He slides it through to Tartt.

653
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:12,644
Is this the moment?

654
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,564
Obisanya's gonna have a go.

655
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,901
<i>Oh! It's in, off the face of Rojas!</i>

656
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:21,736
- Absolutely brilliant.
- Yes!

657
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:24,155
In the blink of an eye.
Would you believe it?

658
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:26,741
An historic goal, and it's 1-1.

659
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,620
My face scored a goal!
My face scored a goal!

660
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:34,165
Chris, have you ever scored
with your face?

661
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:38,128
I've scored with every part of my body,
Arlo. That's a ridiculous question.

662
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,297
- That was amazing.
- Yeah, mate.

663
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:42,758
Do you think Zava saw?

664
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,594
Don't be a dick, man.

665
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:48,721
Come on.

666
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,348
Excuse me. Sorry.

667
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:51,433
Ooh.

668
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,062
Oi, how'd it go?

669
00:39:56,063 --> 00:40:00,192
- Did you sweet-talk him?
- Uh, what's the opposite of that?

670
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:02,361
Sour-yell.

671
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:04,571
Yeah, I did that.

672
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:10,910
And Richmond
managed to secure a 1-1 draw

673
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,412
<i>against Chelsea
in this gripping West London derby.</i>

674
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:16,040
- There we go. There you go.
- They'll be leaving Stamford Bridge

675
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,502
<i>with a well-deserved point on the table.</i>

676
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:26,133
Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us.

677
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:28,928
Obviously not the result
we were hoping for today.

678
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:33,224
{\an8}But I am certain
that this afternoon's announcement

679
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:36,519
{\an8}will raise every Chelsea fan's spirits.

680
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,690
- Now, I know...
- Still think we need to get to the office.

681
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:41,566
It won't be safe here.

682
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:44,110
Please welcome the newest member

683
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,446
of Chelsea Football Club.

684
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,198
{\an8}Zava.

685
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:55,163
Welcome, Zava.
Please take a seat.

686
00:40:56,665 --> 00:41:01,253
All right. You just sign.
And there's the pen.

687
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:05,299
Please.

688
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,142
{\an8}I have changed my mind.
Zava will not play for Chelsea.

689
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,438
Oh, God. I'm sorry. I can't watch this.

690
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,358
{\an8}Zava will play for Richmond.

691
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,116
You twat!

692
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:35,412
- May I keep the pen?
- Sure.

693
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:39,123
What? Oh!

694
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:42,336
Oh!

695
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,421
What the fuck?

696
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:46,756
- You did it.
- Yeah.

697
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:48,466
- You did it!
- Oh, my God.

698
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:51,469
Yo! We've got Zava.

699
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,553
What?

700
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:55,014
We've got Zava! Look!

701
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:58,810
Oh! Oh, shit! Oh!

702
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,941
Fans are not gonna like this.

703
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:10,781
Zava! We got you, Zava!
We got you, Zava! We got you, ra, ra, ra!

704
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,328
- All right, man. Take care, man.
- Take care.

705
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,414
- Zava is coming here.
- Ah, Zava.

706
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:37,599
What you up to tonight, Coach?
You wanna race-walk home together?

707
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,102
Uh, can't. Jane and I are gonna go see
her friend's immersive theater show

708
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:42,271
about the menstrual cycle.

709
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:46,649
Oh. All right, well,
I hope you're not late.

710
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,359
Please tell Jane I said hello.

711
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,030
I would, but, uh, she still finds
our relationship threatening.

712
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,824
Hmm.

713
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:55,658
- Night, guys.
- Good night.

714
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:57,368
Night, Coach.

715
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:00,747
What do you say, Mr. Crimm?
Heck of a first week, yeah?

716
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:03,792
- And we've only just begun.
- Mm-hmm.

717
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:06,086
- Good night.
- Night, Roy.

718
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,339
Hey, Roy. I'm just curious,
what was it like being back at Chelsea?

719
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,718
All them fans sure were happy
to see you.

720
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:20,016
I don't know. Just felt... sad.
Or something.

721
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:21,852
Really? Why is that?

722
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:42,539
Last season I was there,
we played a match against Arsenal,

723
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,251
- and we fucking murdered 'em. Mmm.
- I remember, 3-nil.

724
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:48,670
Yeah.

725
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:51,840
But I played like shit.

726
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:55,636
Right?

727
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,183
I did.

728
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:05,312
That was the first time, ever, I thought,

729
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:08,232
"I can't keep up anymore.

730
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:11,485
I'm not good enough."

731
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:17,449
And that was all I could think
about for the rest of the year.

732
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:24,498
I knew it was only gonna get worse.
So at the end of the season, I left.

733
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:32,255
Everyone was shocked.
The club was shocked. The fans. The press.

734
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:33,632
Yeah.

735
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:36,384
I didn't wanna be
one of them broken-down footballers

736
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:38,720
just taking up space
until they're dropped,

737
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:40,847
years after they should have been.

738
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:44,810
Yeah, well, a lot of folks think it's
better to quit than to be fired, you know?

739
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:46,979
Yeah.

740
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:51,108
But going back there today...

741
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,779
there's a part of me...

742
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:00,200
thinking maybe I should have stayed...

743
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:05,414
and just fucking...

744
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:09,543
enjoyed myself.

745
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:18,343
But that is not who I am,

746
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:20,554
I guess.

747
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:23,515
Not yet.

748
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,643
Hmm.

749
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:30,981
But, hey, if you wouldn't have
left Chelsea when you did,

750
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:33,859
we probably never would have met.

751
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:46,079
- Good night.
- Good night.

752
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,624
Good night, Roy.

753
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:54,004
Sport.

754
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:56,506
It's quite the metaphor.

755
00:45:56,507 --> 00:46:00,344
Yeah.
It also makes for a heck of a nickname.

756
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,220
Yeah.

757
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,348
- Night, Ted.
- Good night, sport.

758
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,023
Hmm.
