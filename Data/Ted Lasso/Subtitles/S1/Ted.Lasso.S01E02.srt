You wanna grab some breakfast?

00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,366
Nah, I just had one piece of cereal and I'm pretty stuffed.

8
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,791
Could go for coffee though.

Yeah.

That's close.

-What about you, Coach? How you feeling? -A little nervous.

00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,804
Well, heck, yeah. No such thing as "last-day jitters."

They call cleats "boots."

I thought you said that the trunk of a car was a boot.

Also a boot.

I just need you to assume you're my default Nate, okay?

109

Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, first time away from home is never easy.

I'm not always sure what's a joke and what isn't.

-Boy George. -[sighs] Not you, you garden gnome.

124
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,545
He wants us to get together every morning

125
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,380
to get to know me and hear what I've got to say.

126
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,505
The nerve!

127
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,261

Everywhere he's been, his players seem to love him.

129
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,638
It's the one thing that could just muck this up.

133
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:43,985
Higgins, do you know which of the players has the most sway in the locker room?

134
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,026
Uh, no.

135
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,994
So helpful. Then solve me this different mystery.

136
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,118
Find out where Lasso got those biscuits.

137
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,754
Watch out, biscuits! Higgins is on the case. [chuckles]

138

[players chattering]

139
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,721
All right, fellas. Excuse me.

140
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,130
Listen up!

141
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,218
[chattering stops]

142
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,852
Whoa. Thank you, Coach.

143
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,219
Now, we got Crystal Palace coming here on Saturday.

144
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,466
Anything we need to know, Coach?

145
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,478
-Lot of speed on the outside. -Okay. Anything else?

146
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,061
Lot of speed.

147
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,355
Okay, you heard the man.

148
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,688
Uh, y'all whipped 'em up pretty good earlier this year,

149
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,654
so me and Coach ain't gonna mess with the game plan.

150
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,235
But-- but-- but-- but-- but-- but--

151
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,120
we would like to start fiddling with the way we do things in the locker room.

152
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,238
And if the Internet has taught us anything,

153
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,075
it's that sometimes it's easier to speak our minds anonymously.

154
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,462
Right? So I asked Nate here to make us a good old-fashioned suggestion box.

155
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,131
The-- Hey, look at that.

156
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,169
Yeah, did it with my niece. She loves crafts, so--

157
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,264
Uh-huh. Yeah. I love glimpses into your personal life.

158
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,339
This is lovely.

159
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,804
So, if anything's got y'all hot and bothered,

160
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,295
just go ahead and drop us a note.

161
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,885
You could have issue with, uh, the color of the towels

162
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,183
or, heck, the food in the vending machine.

163
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,267
Sound good?

164
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,773
Okay, great. See y'all tomorrow.

165
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,648
Oi. We're middle of the table, we've lost three of four,

166
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,985
and you wanna know if the snacks in the locker room are tasty enough?

167
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,281
Are they?

168
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,990
Jesus Christ.

169
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,286
Uh, they are not.

170
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,210
Oh. [clears throat]

171
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,548
[footsteps approaching]

172
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,643
[sighs] That's a long time to wait, Ted.

173
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,809
Well, I respect you didn't hurry.

174
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,390
So, how was your first official day?

175
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,477
I'm not entirely sure

176
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,061
what y'all's smallest unit of measurement is over here,

177
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,357
but that's about how much headway I made. [chuckles]

178
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,151
-And yet, you seem undeterred. -Mm.

179
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,566
[car engine revs]

180
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,695
[tires screeching]

181
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,071
Solid entrance.

182
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,117
[upbeat music playing on car radio]

183
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,751
What would you rather be, a lion or a panda?

184
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,748
-[car door closes] -I don't have time for this.

185
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,120
Okay.

186
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,707
-Ted? -Gotta go panda.

187
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:06,512
Are you mad? Pandas are fat and lazy and have piss-stained fur.

188
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,298
Lions are powerful and majestic and rule the jungle.

189
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,554
Try telling that to an elephant. Ooh, can I be an elephant?

190
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,676
Mm-mmm. Lion or panda.

191
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,932
-Panda. -[Rebecca] Lion!

192
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,183
-What's black and white and red all over? -I don't know. What?

193
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:21,186
A panda that gets anywhere near a fucking lion. The answer is lion.

194
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:23,806
All right.

195
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,277
That Rebecca is an intimidating, very tall woman.

196
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,148
I mean, the minute she locked eyes with me, I, like, started sweating.

197
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,656
Oh, no. She got some fences, all right, but you just gotta hop over 'em.

198
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,159
-Hi, babe. -[Jamie] Mm.

199
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,868
Here. Keys.

200
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,583
Hey, Jamie, what would you rather be? A lion or a panda?

201
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,043
-Coach, I'm me. -Mm-hmm.

202
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,535
Why would I wanna be anything else?

203
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,876
I'm not sure you realize how psychologically healthy that actually is.

204
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,880
Hm. Cheers. [clicks tongue]

205
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,835
Night Court.

206
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,176
Wow.

207
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,891
-He's a lion. -Definitely lion.

208
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,641
You know pandas eat their weight in bamboo? My little boy told me that.

209
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,274
-No! -What are you talking about?

210
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,810
Pandas are capable of it.

211
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:03,854
I don't know how often they actually do that.

212
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,694
[Coach Beard] Sam's down in every stat since Nigeria.

213
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,574
Maybe the Premiership's too much for him.

214
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,991
No, he just needs to get a little more comfy here, that's all.

215
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,200
-He turns 20 on Saturday. -There we go. A birthday.

216
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,622
We'll do something special for him.

217
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,950
Nudge that ship in the right direction, yeah?

218
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,036
Hey.

219
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:21,906
[rattles]

220
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,249
-Mm. -[laughs]

221
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,793
Let's see what we got here.

222
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,586
-"Wanker." -Hmm.

223
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,879
Let's see what else we got. "Piss off, wanker."

224
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,718
"I hope you choke on a Big Mac."

225
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,301
-Good thing these are anonymous. -No, Roy signed that one.

226
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,387
-Roy. -Oh, here's a good one.

227
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,392
"Shower pressure is rubbish." Make a note of that.

228
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,095
Uh, "Wanker." Yep.

229
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,981
Oh, I'm not gonna say that word out loud.

230
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,935
Um, another "wanker."

231
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,945
You don't wanna let them call you a wanker, Ted. It's bad.

232
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,362
[stammers] What's a wanker?

233
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,445
I'm a visual learner, so that's very helpful. Thank you.

234
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,287
Mm. My pleasure.

235
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,825
[Ted] Okay, I got one.

236
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:06,833
Uh, what if I joined forces with a swashbuckling cat...

237
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:07,747
Uh-huh.

238
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,205
...to play tiny guitars for women of the night

239
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,705
as we read Alex Haley's most seminal work?

240
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,468
You'd be in cahoots with Puss in Boots,

241
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,840
playing lutes for prostitutes, reading Roots.

242
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,347
No, The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I gotcha.

243
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,599
[Coach Beard] All right.

244
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,391
Here we go. Hey, hold my beer.

245
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,645
All right, see what you got, young lady. Come on. What you got? What you got? Whoa!

246
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,228
-[girl laughing] -Are you kidding me?

247
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,321
You see that?

248
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,029
She spun you around like the Tasmanian Devil.

249
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,239
Yeah, she did. Except without all that annoying...

250
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,779
[imitates Tasmanian Devil babble]

251
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,115
Wrong again.

252
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,706
[spits] Why is this so hard for you, Higgins?

253
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,420
[Ted] What time is it?

254
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,170
It's "Biscuits with the Boss" time! [grunts]

255
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,883
-Wha-- And Higgins! Hey. [chuckles] -[Higgins chuckles]

256
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,054
Three's a crowd.

257
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,682
Hey, that's a crowd I don't mind being smack-dab in the middle of, buddy.

258
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,639
[gags]

259
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,009
Hey, boss. Check this out. Pow.

260
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,716
Let's tie up some loose ends from yesterday.

261
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,516
First concert, Kenny Rogers, right?

262
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,730
Best concert, we got Beastie Boys at HORDE Fest, 1995.

263
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,101
You're gonna love this story.

264
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,018
Actually, did y'all get the O.J. trial over here?

265
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:14,436
Ted, please. I can't just have you waltzing in here whenever you wish.

266
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,986
What if I soft-shoe in, huh? Little something like that.

267
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,530
Or-- or I can moonwalk in.

268
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,284
Huh? Despite recent headlines, it's still a fun dance move to do.

269
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,076
-Ted, Ted. -You gotta see the way I see it, okay?

270
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,711
Everybody in this building, part of the team. Part of AFC Richmond.

271
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,248
Team's gotta bond. All right?

272
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,132
I mean, heck, Higgins and I are having lunch today.

273
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,379
Oh, yes. We're having salads in my office.

274
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,801
[Ted] All right, catch you later, boss.

275
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,629
Higgins, see you at lunch, huh?

276
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,014
Caesar you later.

277
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,088
[Higgins grunts]

278
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,392
Yes. Yes.

279
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,143
[Higgins sighs]

280
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,726
He's intolerable.

281
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,689
[water sputters]

282
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,020
[Ted] Boy. That is bad.

283
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,404
Somebody ought to check this thing's prostate.

284
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:54,896
Jeez.

285
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,743
[players chattering]

286
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,068
[Ted] Yeah.

287
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,073
Hey, Sam. You gotta pop upstairs real quick.

288
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,985
Higgins wants to talk to you.

289
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,494
Let's go. Move it, move it.

290
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,873
Yep, yep. He's gone, he's gone.

291
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,535
Shut the door, shut the door. Hey. Yo, hey, guys. Listen up, listen up.

292
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,424
Okay, Sam's birthday is on Saturday.

293
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,921
So I was thinking we'd all chip in and get him something nice.

294
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,343
Nice gift or something. Right?

295
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,511
So, Nate's gonna be coming around with yet another impressive box.

296
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,431
Look at this, wow! It's got a face!

297
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,970
-Uh, he has a face. -Sorry, it-- Uh, he. He.

298
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,144
-You put the money in his mouth. -Okay, you hear that, y'all?

299
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,563
You put the money in his mouth. Got it? Okay, good.

300
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,813
Go get 'em, Nate.

301
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:32,562
Okay? Help him out.

302
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,936
All right. Lovely. Thanks, Colin.

303
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,739
Uh...

304
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,776
You put the, uh, the money in his mouth.

305
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,327
[Jamie] Yummy for you. Mm.

306
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:51,287
It's spearmint. Make the money smell nice.

307
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,633
Thank you, Jamie. That's incredibly thoughtful.

308
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,589
[Colin chuckles]

309
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,963
Hey, Jamie-- Jamie-- Jamie. Real quick.

310
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,376
Uh, just wanna have a chat. Did you put gum in the box there?

311
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,386
-Uh, yeah. Yeah. -Now, why'd you go and do that?

312
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,548
-Uh, sorry, Coach. -Nate's just trying to help us out here.

313
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,137
-He's part of the team, right? -Yeah, right, Coach. Yeah, yeah.

314
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,893
And I see this team like a band.

315
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:10,975
I love that.

316
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,309
-And if we were the Rolling Stones... -Mm-hmm.

317
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,855
...I'd be Mick Jagger, 'cause I'm the front man.

318
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,149
-Sure. -I got the moves.

319
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,232
Got a tiny waist, yeah. The whole bit. I get it.

320
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,698
And Roy would be Keith Richards,

321
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,068
'cause he's old and everyone's surprised he ain't dead yet.

322
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,566
What the fuck are you saying?

323
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,327
Roy, mate, if you're gonna go to the shower,

324
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,539
you should take your sweater off first, pal.

325
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,155
[Jamie laughing]

326
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,046
I'm just taking the piss, mate. Yeah.

327
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,878
I'll be better. Promise.

328
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,883
Glad to hear it. Yeah.

329
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,392
[players laughing]

330
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,848
[reporters clamoring]

331
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,141
Marcus, what you got?

332
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,644
How are you feeling about taking on Crystal Palace this weekend?

333
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,936
A palace made out of crystal seems mighty fragile if you ask me.

334
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,105
-[reporter] Coach. -[reporter 2] Coach!

335
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,396
-[Ted] Yeah, right there. -Trent Crimm, The Independent.

336
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,025
Oh, I remember, Trent.

337
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,281
I'm just curious. Could you explain the offside rule?

338
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,084
Well, Trent, I'm gonna put it the same way the US Supreme Court did

339
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,250
back in 1964 when they defined pornography.

340
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,500
It ain't easy to explain, but you know it when you see it.

341
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,172
-[reporters laugh] -[reporter 3] Coach. Coach.

342
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,841
-Yeah, this gentleman right here. -Ernie Lounds, The Sun.

343
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
-[reporters groan] -Thank you.

344
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,915
Uh, this question's for Miss Mannion.

345
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,217
-It's "Welton." -Of course. My apologies.

346
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,722
Any thoughts on the newest Rupert girl?

347
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,639
Uh, well, Rupert and I are no longer together, so, uh...

348
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,478
He may consort with whatever model-actress, actress-model he pleases.

349
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,563
[reporters chuckling]

350
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:42,027
No, the girl who came forward today is another one who was with Rupert

351
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,109
while you were married.

352
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,696
I mean, she says it started five years ago.

353
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,330
And they kept it going until, well, still.

354
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,448
[camera shutter clicking]

355
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,115
Oh. [chuckles]

356
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,249
And all this time I thought men couldn't multitask.

357
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,625
[reporters laugh]

358
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,012
-[reporters clamoring] -I'm afraid that's all we have time for.

359
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,469
Thank you so much.

360
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,299
[reporters] Coach! Coach!

361
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,773
-[knocks] -Hey. How are you?

362
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,901
-[Rebecca sighs] -Just wanna make sure you're doing okay.

363
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,558
You know, that was pretty rough back there.

364
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,816
I expect nothing less from the press.

365
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:22,899
Yeah.

366
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,355
Sorry, did you need somebody to post that? Because that person's not me.

367
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:31,486
[chuckles] No, come on. This is a care package from my little boy.

368
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,485
Oh.

369
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:35,326
Maybe something in here can help cheer you up, yeah?

370
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,372
-Got a, uh, small battalion of army men. -[sighs]

371
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,747
Says here on the card that

372
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,543
I'm supposed to set 'em up in my apartment to help keep me safe.

373
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:43,878
-[chuckles] -Uh, oh!

374
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,222
[trumpets]

375
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,878
-Homemade kazoo. -Excellent.

376
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,466
Only got one of those though, so you can't have that.

377
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,972
Oh! Oh, hey now.

378
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:53,814
Look at that right there.

379
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,769
You know, this right here is some of the best barbecue sauce in Kansas City,

380
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,691
which makes it some of the best barbecue sauce in the world.

381
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,767
Ooh, yes!

382
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,607
You got some kind of food or something that can teleport you back home,

383
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,823
make you feel warm and fuzzy?

384
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,656
-No. -Mm-hmm.

385
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,332
-Will that be all, Ted? -No.

386
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,040
No, actually, the whole reason I'm here is 'cause I'm having a little trouble

387
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,292
figuring out Jamie Tartt's operating instructions,

388
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,955
and I, you know-- I was just seeing if you happened to have any advice.

389
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,674
Oh, sorry, I'm afraid--

390
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,296
[Ted] Ooh.

391
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,721
Your eyes just lit up. You got an idea. What is it? Go on.

392
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,930
I was just gonna say you should go and talk to Keeley.

393
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,350
I mean, you two have an obvious rapport. If anyone knows Jamie, it's her.

394
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,140
-See, that's why you're the boss, right? -Mm.

395
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,894
[chuckles] That's good. Hey, tell you what I'm gonna do though.

396
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,057
I'm gonna give you one of these stinkers. Let's see. Let's get you a good one.

397
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,066
Okay, this right here is gonna be your first line of defense,

398
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,859
in case that little turkey Ernie Lounds comes back around, huh?

399
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,614
How about that? We'll aim him right at the door there for you.

400
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,204
All right, thanks, boss. I appreciate you.

401
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,871
[upbeat music playing]

402
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:01,003
[photographer] Yes! You look beautiful. Just-- just pet the lion.

403
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,418
Exactly!

404
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,630
I love it. Give me a growl, yeah.

405
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,251
[roars]

406
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:08,797
Sexy, yeah.

407
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:12,341
Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah, all right.

408
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,886
Let's set up for the next shot.

409
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,639
-Hi. -Hey, how you doing?

410
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,261
Yeah, I'm all right. How are you?

411
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,847
Yeah, not bad. So, you went with the lion, huh?

412
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,443
-Yeah. -I'm a little hurt, but it looks cool.

413
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,189
[laughing] I look insane.

414
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,147
But I do think it's a better look than the panda.

415
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,491
Oh, yeah.

416
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,779
[both chuckle]

417
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,162
-Fuck, I'm famished. -Yeah?

418
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,738
Most lions are.

419
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,333
-Oh, look. Let's get some food. -Okay.

420
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,078
-You hungry? -Yeah, is it free?

421
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,080
Gotta be pretty fun for you, yeah?

422
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,332
Yeah. I'm getting paid a shit ton

423
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,873
to get dressed up like an animal and sell caffeinated vodka.

424
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,577
But I do get to go home with the paws.

425
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,707
Well, there's the perks right there. Yeah.

426
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,964
-Can I have a bite? Mm. -Yeah. There you go.

427
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,927
-[muffled] Thank you. Mm. -[grunts] Careful. You're welcome.

428
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,838
I know that you didn't just pop down to feed me.

429
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:59,005
No, you're right. Uh, I wanted to ask you about Jamie.

430
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,847
-Mm. -Yeah.

431
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,729
What would you say motivates him?

432
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,940
Blow jobs.

433
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,438
Mm.

434
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,403
Is there a second option?

435
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,283
[both chuckle]

436
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,860
Go on, give us another bite.

437
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,070
Hey. There you are.

438
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,082
Now, look, I know the kid's gonna be a star.

439
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:21,084
I was kinda hoping he'd, you know, warm up

440
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,661
to the team building I'm trying to do here. That's all.

441
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,627
Actually, he responds well to positive reinforcement.

442
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,498
-That's my wheelhouse. -There you go, then.

443
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,125
Okay. Bite.

444
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,382
-[laughs] -Mm.

445
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,094
-Go on, give us one more bite. -Here you go.

446
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,134
Yeah.

447
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,296
-That was a big one. -Well, yep.

448
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,677
Oop, you got some ketchup there.

449
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,523
Looks like you devoured an antelope.

450
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,888
-Help me. -Just be careful. Hold on.

451
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,475
[Keeley] Yeah, I feel that. There's a lot of it.

452
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,440
[Ted] Yeah, it's a lot and I'm just--

453
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,479
[crowd] Richmond! Richmond!

454
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:52,324
[commentator] We are moments away from Crystal Palace facing AFC Richmond

455
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,571
and their new manager, Ted Lasso.

456
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:59,493
While on the pitch, all eyes will surely be on young phenom, Jamie Tartt.

457
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:01,785
All right, fellas, here we go. Here we go.

458
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,329
Uh, Coach, you got any last words?

459
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,422
-Speed on the outside. -Speed on the outside. You heard the man.

460
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,458
That's all we got for you, except for one thing.

461
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,092
And that's Happy Birthday, Sam!

462
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,670
[players cheering, whistling]

463
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,679
Eh, Babatunde's the best. [laughs]

464
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,890
-Hey. [laughs] -Hey, enjoy.

465
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,397
Hey, man, you guys got me Chin Chin.

466
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,859
Wow, this is all I used to eat growing up. [laughs]

467
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,941
We know you haven't been home in a while, so we thought we'd bring some home to you.

468
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,698
You guys, man.

469
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:38,859
[speaking Yoruba]

470
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,532
[speaking Yoruba]

471
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,292
-Hey. Happy Birthday, Sam. -Thank you, Coach.

472
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,166
We got a few things in there for you.

473
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,803
Coach, what's-- what's this?

474
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:58,384
[chuckles] Well, my little boy gave me a whole bunch of these.

475
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,177
You know, help keep me safe while I'm away.

476
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,890
I miss him, you know.

477
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,310
My dad used to-- always used to pinch my earlobes for good luck.

478
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,807
Give me a fucking break.

479
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,525
Sorry, Coach.

480
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,200
Um, Coach, is it-- is it okay if I don't keep this?

481
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,819
I don't really have the same fondness for the American military that you do.

482
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,908
Oh, sure. Right.

483
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,703
-Imperialism. Right. Yeah. -Imperialism.

484
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,407
Thank you, Coach. Thank you.

485
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:29,407
[Ted] All right, fellas.

486
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,708
Let's get out there and show Crystal Palace whose house this is, right?

487
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,673
[cheering]

488
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,712
[commentator] West meets South again.

489
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:40,177
It's Derby Day in London, and the atmosphere is electric.

490
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,349
With a new owner in the boardroom and a new manager in the dugout,

491
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:47,268
will it be a new dawn for the perennial underdog, AFC Richmond?

492
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,731
Welcome to what the home fans call the "Dogtrack."

493
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:55,361
It's Nelson Road Stadium, for AFC Richmond against Crystal Palace.

494
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,280
I'm Arlo White and this is Chris Powell.

495
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,030
[Chris] And it's great to be here, Arlo.

496
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,244
-You ready? -Your fly is down.

497
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:04,618
Oh. Thank you.

498
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
All right, shall we?

499
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,750
[Arlo] Chris, did you ever play under an American manager?

500
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:12,329
Never did, Arlo. Wouldn't have minded it. I do speak the language.

501
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,344
[crowd chanting] Wanker! Wanker! Wanker!

502
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,550
Wanker! Wanker! Wanker! Wanker! Wanker!

503
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,512
Wanker! Wanker!

504
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,310
[Arlo] To the fans at home, we do apologize for the fruity language.

505
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,139
Wanker! Wanker!

506
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:32,305
[Arlo] It was a risky hire by new owner, Rebecca Welton.

507
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,654
Does she know something we don't?

508
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,060
Wanker! Wanker!

509
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:38,278
Oi! Give him a chance.

510
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,688
[fans groan]

511
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,067
Wanker!

512
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:44,074
We got 90 minutes to prove 'em wrong, yeah?

513
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:45,781
Let's give it a shot.

514
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,446
[Arlo] Here we go.

515
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,374
[whistle blows]

516
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,206
[Arlo] And there you go.

517
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:54,288
It's an inauspicious start to the Ted Lasso era.

518
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,964
[fans shouting]

519
00:22:56,668 --> 00:23:01,758
Richmond looked disjointed, uninspired, and, you have to say, joyless.

520
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,430
Palace win and Richmond lose 4-1.

521
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,890
The only bright spot being the defensive play of Sam Obisanya.

522
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,221
Only bright spot?

523
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,811
Without me, it would've been 4-0, you miserable old pricks.

524
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:15,853
And a meaningless consolation goal for Jamie Tartt in injury time.

525
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,228
Thank you!

526
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:19,977
Jamie. Real quick.

527
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,527
[Arlo] Regarding Jamie Tartt,

528
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,610
it was an insignificant goal by the Manchester City loanee,

529
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,066
but he celebrated like he'd just won the World Cup.

530
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,290
I haven't known you that long, but...

531
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:36,213
I can honestly say you are the best athlete I have ever coached.

532
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,047
Wow. Um...

533
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:42,796
Yeah. I mean, I-- I work hard, yeah.

534
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:43,881
I see it.

535
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,968
You are truly great at everything you do out there.

536
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:49,183
[clicks tongue] Except for one thing.

537
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,353
My left foot cross?

538
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,640
No. Jamie, I think that you might be so sure that you're one in a million,

539
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,107
that sometimes you forget that out there, you're just one of eleven.

540
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:04,237
And if you just figure out some way to turn that "me" into "us"...

541
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,319
[whistles]

542
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,198
...the sky's the limit for you.

543
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,491
Was a heck of a goal out there, by the way.

544
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:14,542
-Thanks. -Mm-hmm.

545
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,128
[Arlo] Richmond fall to 13th place.

546
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,962
[Chris] I'm sure they won't be there very long.

547
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,467
[Arlo] Is that optimism, Chris?

548
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,969
[Chris] No. Actually, I'm wearing Obsession by Calvin Klein.

549
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,141
That was fucking embarrassing!

550
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,810
Oh, I-- I am equally livid.

551
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,061
-[player] Blimey, mate. -[player 2] Jesus Christ.

552
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,602
Oh, my God.

553
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,435
-[player 3] Didn't know he had it in him. -Good lad.

554
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
[upbeat music playing]

555
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:43,322
Oh, my God.

556
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:55,002
Hey, come on now. [claps]

557
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,658
Hey, let's shake this one off, all right?

558
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:59,077
Start getting better on Monday. Until then--

559
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:03,496
Hey, DJ Beard-o, why don't you, uh, help pick up the mood in here, all right?

560
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:04,877
-[hip-hop music playing on speakers] -Uh-oh.

561
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,383
Little Phife Dawg and Q-Tip comin' at you.

562
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,257
Come on now. Everybody get some cake.

563
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:13,184
You know, it's Sam's birthday. Go ahead, get some sugar in your system.

564
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:14,263
Go on now.

565
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,023
-[Ted] Hey, y'all. -[gasps]

566
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:29,027
I come bearing sweet treats to numb the sting of defeat. [chuckles]

567
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:31,622
-Yeah. -Oh, thank you.

568
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:35,448
And hey, just so you know, we can play a lot better than we showed today.

569
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:41,496
I know it would mean a lot to the guys if y'all just came down, joined in.

570
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,423
Let 'em know you're still in their corner.

571
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:47,008
That's all the arm twisting I'm gonna do though, okay?

572
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:48,548
[Rebecca chuckles]

573
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,507
Ted, you know what might convince me?

574
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,717
If you told me where you got these delicious biscuits.

575
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:59,805
Well, if I did that, I wouldn't be able to bring you more on Monday, would I?

576
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:00,893
[chuckles]

577
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,610
All right. Hope to see y'all downstairs.

578
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,729
Mm! Oh, it's good cake.

579
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,398
Jamie! Trent Crimm, The Independent.

580
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:14,527
That was, uh, quite a beating today. How you taking the loss?

581
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:18,954
Look, it's not just me though, is it? We're a team. I'm just one of eleven.

582
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,750
-[man] Candy from a baby. -[Trent] Okay.

583
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:22,832
[man 2] They were rubbish.

584
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:30,424
Fuck it. Yeah, I am taking it pretty hard, you know?

585
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,887
The rest of them, they're all in there eating cake.

586
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,138
-Seriously? -Yeah, seriously, mate.

587
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,640
The new gaffer's got music on in there. It's like a party. It's a joke.

588
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:42,733
[players cheering]

589
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:46,152
[camera shutter clicks]

590
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,788
[grunting]

591
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,500
Careful, son. The gaffer's fixed the water pressure.

592
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,593
[Coach Beard] I hate losing.

593
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,128
[Ted] Bird by bird, Coach.

594
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,052
-Good night, Coach. -Night, Coach.

595
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:14,053
Uh-oh, here's trouble.

596
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,005
-I saw the match. -Oh, yeah? What'd you think?

597
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,005
-You were rubbish. -[chuckles]

598
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:20,967
-Yeah, maybe so. -Yeah.

599
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:22,978
I did wanna get your advice on one thing.

600
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:26,475
Uh, what do you think-- Oh! Look at that! Got ya!

601
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:28,573
-Yeah? All right, I underestimated you. -Yeah.

602
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,189
See, no one sees me coming. Come on, what you got? What you got?

603
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,606
That was quick. Okay, I'm gonna take my backpack off now.

604
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:34,775
We're gonna really do this.

605
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,033
-Let me stretch here a little bit. -[chuckling] All right. Yeah.

606
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:39,365
Here we go. Okay. All right, now you're in trouble.

607
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,791
[girl] Get your breath back.

608
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:46,116
[rock music playing]

609
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:51,844
[phone buzzes]

610
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,342
[clears throat]

611
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,139
What?

612
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,390
I just sent you the pictures.

613
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:00,681
[phone chimes]

614
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,559
That's exactly what I wanted.

615
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,815
The star player's girlfriend and the new manager.

616
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:14,074
Are you sure you want to do this?

617
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,492
The press will eat them alive.

618
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,502
Miss Welton?

619
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:35,169
Do it.

620
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,053
[clatters]

621
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:44,805
