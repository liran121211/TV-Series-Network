1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:09,426
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,971
No, Trevor, no.
The bag has to go all the way in, okay?

3
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,134
Use all the space. Out the way. Thank you.

4
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:19,062
What's gone on back here? Right.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:24,475
These need to be moved around, 'cause
this is gonna jiggle about, otherwise.

6
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:26,486
Now, can we move... Hello?

7
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,448
There's someone in here. Oh, my God.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,966
Hey, almost forgot. You know
how we're playing Everton tomorrow?

9
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,301
- Yeah.
- Well, that's not a town.

10
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:37,405
- It's actually a team in Liverpool!
- Like the Beatles!

11
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:41,706
If you see John, Paul, George or Ringo,
will you take a picture, please?

12
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:42,841
Hey, you got it, big guy.

13
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,587
Okay, hey,
I better get a roll on here, all right?

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,131
Okay. And Mom wants to talk to you.
Hold on.

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,715
- I love you, buddy.
- Love you too.

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,485
Still haven't told him
John and George are dead?

17
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,590
They're what?

18
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,218
It was Keith Richards.

19
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,929
Hey, Ted.

20
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,143
- Hey. How you doing?
- Good.

21
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,814
How's work going? Everything all right?

22
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,942
Yeah. I'm sorry. I know this isn't easy,
but the paperwork the lawyer sent?

23
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,650
I know. Oh, hey.

24
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:06,534
Got it right here.

25
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:10,108
I'll, uh, look it all over, sign it,
send it right back. I promise.

26
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:12,944
Okay, thanks. Hey, good luck tomorrow.
We'll be watching.

27
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,031
All right now.

28
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,956
Whoo-hoo!

29
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:29,384
- Girls' trip!
- Mm. Liverpool, here we come.

30
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:30,543
I just want to say up front

31
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,777
that I'm really flattered
you asked me to come this weekend.

32
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,551
Oh. Come on now.

33
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:38,015
But, hey, we're both single.
I think you are super hot.

34
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,950
If I'm gonna dip my toe back
into the lady pool,

35
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,724
I can't think of a finer body of water
to do it with than you.

36
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,651
No. Keeley, I think you're confused.

37
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,150
I was, at first.
Then I was like, "Come on, Keeley.

38
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:50,442
Blow off some steam and have
some wicked sex with your new friend."

39
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,656
I'm fucking with you.

40
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,281
Oh, my God.

41
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,537
I thought you were being serious.
I mean, can you imagine?

42
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,748
Oh, I have.

43
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,787
Do-da do-da do do do do doo

44
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,673
Looks like we have a new passenger
on today's flight.

45
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,020
Actually, Keeley will be taking your seat
on the jet, Higgins.

46
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,463
Oh.

47
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:10,804
Sorry.

48
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,841
I'm gonna go spend a penny
before we take off.

49
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,175
See you downstairs, Rebecca.

50
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,179
Oh, that's okay. I always
enjoy the antics on the team bus.

51
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,352
No. I need you to stay here this weekend.

52
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,562
Doing work that doesn't matter.

53
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,983
All right, gentlemen. Who's ready
to go show Everton what we got?

54
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,485
Whoo!

55
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,066
Thank you, Dani.

56
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,740
Jeez, Louise.
Why's everybody so down in the dumps?

57
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:42,156
What happened?
Did BeyoncÃ© dump Jay-Z or something?

58
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,286
No, nothing like that.

59
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:47,331
Thank goodness. Just saying it out loud
made me immediately sad.

60
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,706
Let me see what's going on here.

61
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,264
Hey, guys. Seriously, come on.
Talk to me. What's up?

62
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,343
Well, we're fine.

63
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,433
Mm.

64
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,889
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Okay.

65
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,930
We're in a shit fucking mood because
we never fucking win at Everton

66
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,854
and it sucks fucking shit!

67
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,770
Ah, come on, fellas.

68
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,901
How long has it been
since y'all won up at Everton?

69
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,364
- Sixty years ago.
- Jesus Christ.

70
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:12,688
Wow. That is a heck of a long time. Okay.

71
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,355
So we got that going on.

72
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:17,324
And obviously we're bummed out
that O'Brien tore his butt.

73
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,945
It's my upper hamstring, Coach.

74
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,491
You tore your butt, son. There's nothing
to be ashamed of, okay? It happens.

75
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,457
People tear their butts all the time
in athletics. You're not alone, man.

76
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,433
Hey, Coach,
you've torn your butt a few times, right?

77
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:29,788
- Three times.
- Three times.

78
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,632
Butt's an amazing muscle.
God as my witness, your butt will heal.

79
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,050
The silver lining here,
with O'Brien's tore butt,

80
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,223
is that my man from Montreal is
gonna be filling in at goalie.

81
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,103
- Give it up for Zorro.
- Oh. It's pronounced, um, "Zoreaux."

82
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,890
- I'm sorry. Zorro.
- "Zoreaux."

83
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,384
You... I don't know
what I'm doing wrong here.

84
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,663
Point is, gentlemen,
unless one of y'all got a crystal ball,

85
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,331
we don't know
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

86
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:52,725
That's why we play the game.

87
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,902
So let me hear it! Richmond on three!
One, two, three!

88
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,906
- Richmond!
- Right, come on. Let's go.

89
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,991
- Hey, Coach.
- Howdy, fellas. How can I help you?

90
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:05,945
Um, so, uh, since Jamie Tartt
has gone back to Man City,

91
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,828
uh, you've lost one, you've drawn one,
you've not scored any goals.

92
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,955
- Yeah.
- So I'm wondering,

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,250
how worried are you
about the threat of relegation?

94
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,545
Lloyd, right now I'm mostly concerned
with the definition of relegation.

95
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,254
What you got for me, Marcus?

96
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:22,112
Just wanted to know how you're feeling
about the departure of Jamie Tartt.

97
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,716
Yeah. Um...

98
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,514
Well, if I'm being honest,
it, uh, breaks my heart a little.

99
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,769
I think one of the neatest things
about being a coach

100
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,891
is the connection you get to make
with your players.

101
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,067
That's a loss that hits me a lot harder
and is gonna stay with me a lot longer

102
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,829
than anything that happens
while playing a game on a patch of grass.

103
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,088
All right.
See you fellas in Liverpool, yeah?

104
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,242
Yeah.

105
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,831
Oh. Hey!
Last one there is a Scotch egg! Whoo!

106
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,495
What?

107
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,338
Hey, there he is.

108
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,268
- Good to see you, buddy.
- All right, let's go.

109
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,584
Here we go. It's the presidential suite.
Hope it's to your satisfaction.

110
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,134
Would you like me to show you
the various room amenities?

111
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,759
No, thank you.

112
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,846
My lady and I wanna have
a quick shag and a shower

113
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,271
before we hit the town tonight.

114
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,096
Welcome to Liverpool.

115
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,322
What? He would've spent
a cash tip in, like, a minute.

116
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,108
Come on. The image I just gave him
is gonna last for a lifetime.

117
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,242
No, it's... it's not you. It's... Oh, fuck.

118
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,740
This is Rupert's and my
anniversary weekend. And...

119
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,514
- It's the first one I've spent by myself...
- Hey, it's okay.

120
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:15,081
Thank you.

121
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,170
- Mm.
- Ooh. That's a long hug.

122
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,591
So, just to remind you,
the hotel furniture stays in the rooms,

123
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,136
not the hallway or the pool.

124
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:32,600
Nor are you allowed to ship it
to your homes or other hotels, okay?

125
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,653
All right, fellas,
we got team meal in an hour.

126
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,268
After that, it's either gonna be
movie night or a pillow fight.

127
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,665
What's it gonna be this time around?

128
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,149
Movie night.

129
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,403
All right. But I tell you what,
y'all say "pillow fight" one time,

130
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,088
and we'll never watch another movie
together again.

131
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,382
- That's for you, Coach.
- Thank you, sir.

132
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,026
- And that's for you.
- Thank you.

133
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:50,946
Whoo! Room 5150. Finally.

134
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,406
Sammy Hagar,
greatest lead singer in Van Halen history.

135
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,127
- In the post-David Lee Roth era.
- Thank you.

136
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,959
- Coach, what room you got?
- 5148.

137
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,423
- Hey.
- Howdy, neighbor.

138
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:05,334
Yes, hello. We still haven't received
the champagne I ordered. Thank you.

139
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,262
Ah. Good question. One second.

140
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:12,345
Should I get the concierge to make us
a reservation somewhere tonight?

141
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,192
Shipley's steak house is unmatched
in its cuisine and ambience.

142
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,346
Mm. Is it now? Cool, I can do steak.

143
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,067
Uh, yes. The steak house for two, please.

144
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,944
Does 8:00 p.m. work for you?

145
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,235
The business center is open
24 hours a day.

146
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,321
Okay.

147
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,175
What was that about the business center?

148
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,699
Guests also have access
to our state-of-the-art gym,

149
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,456
filled with the latest
in workout technology.

150
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,538
Like kettlebells!

151
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,923
Oh, my God.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,250
Liverpool has much to offer
when it comes to nightlife.

153
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:45,415
From pubs and clubs,
to the great Asian pastime of karaoke!

154
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,887
I don't even remember doing this.

155
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,345
- And if you're the artsy type...
- Right, enough.

156
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,505
This weekend is moving forward.

157
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,978
When that champagne arrives, we are
going to get drunk, have a nice meal,

158
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,478
and leave the past in the past.

159
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,730
- Sound good?
- Sounds fucking great.

160
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,062
Oh. Speak of the devil.

161
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,240
Hello, Stinky.

162
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:12,735
Still giving you the big room even
without old gray walnuts footing the bill.

163
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,865
Good. Fuck Rupert!

164
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:19,173
Oh. Who's this then?
Is this your concubine? Is she Russian?

165
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,088
- Are you Russian?
- A, I love you. B, who are you?

166
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,968
Let me introduce Flo Collins,
my best mate since we were little.

167
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,009
Brilliant child psychologist
and proud, newly single...

168
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:30,973
Mm-hmm.

169
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,472
Mother to the most amazing 12-year-old
little girl called Nora, my goddaughter.

170
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,466
Wow.

171
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,476
Both of whom I've completely neglected
to speak to in the last six years.

172
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,556
Oh, Jesus, Stinky.

173
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:43,565
Remind me to bury you in the set list
for speeches at my funeral.

174
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,068
Hi, I'm Flo. Or you can call me "Sassy."
I don't care which.

175
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,140
So, you heard about the divorce?

176
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:53,326
Yeah. I bumped into Derren at a party.
He told me right after he hit on me.

177
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,998
Hey, what's new? Still, weird order
for him to roll out that information.

178
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,258
Right,
what's in the plan for tonight, then?

179
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,999
Shall I call down? Get myself a robe?

180
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,082
Oh!

181
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,133
Look what I've got.

182
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:05,878
Ta-da!

183
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,565
Stole it off
a room service trolley outside.

184
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,798
You're amazing!

185
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,932
- I'm Keeley, by the way. Hi!
- Oh!

186
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,153
Yeah, I know who you are, honey.

187
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,427
My ex used to masturbate to you
like a maniac, so...

188
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,611
Am I cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs
thinking we can beat these guys tomorrow?

189
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,988
- No, we match up perfectly.
- Exactly.

190
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,154
What about you, Nate?
You believe these guys can win?

191
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,767
I believe this team can do anything.

192
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,597
See? There you go.
That's what I'm talking about.

193
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,172
Okay, Nate. So if you were me,
what would you tell these guys?

194
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,601
Oh, no. I wouldn't... No, I don't...

195
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,745
Hey. I'm just asking for your opinion.
You understand that, yeah?

196
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,548
- Yeah.
- And you got one, yes?

197
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,591
- Yeah.
- Locked, loaded, ready to rip?

198
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,004
Mm-hmm.

199
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,143
- Let me hear it.
- No.

200
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,639
Why not? What are you afraid's
gonna happen if you tell me?

201
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,615
That you won't like my idea
and it makes you hate me.

202
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,519
Then you fire me.

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,910
Then I have to move back in with my
parents and they'll be ashamed of me.

204
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,621
Then everyone finds out back home
and laughs at me until my face melts off.

205
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,645
Excuse me.

206
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,153
Well, at least he didn't stammer.

207
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,778
Mm.

208
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,346
I gotta go take care of a couple things.
I'll see you in the morning, all right?

209
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,370
Hey, do me a favor.
Keep an eye on these guys,

210
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,496
'cause around the 74 minute mark, there's
gonna be a room full of grown men crying.

211
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,461
I'll be one of 'em.

212
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,261
Right, so I hadn't prepared anything.

213
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,472
Not the brightest idea for a maid
of honor, especially with an open bar.

214
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,104
Yeah, she was the star of the weekend.

215
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,061
- Yeah, I gave Elton John a boner.
- You did what?

216
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,392
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did!

217
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,357
He has repeatedly denied that.

218
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,268
Ah. Classic "she said, she said," innit?

219
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,239
Would you ladies like another bottle?
A little dessert perhaps?

220
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,075
My sexy and extremely single friend here

221
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,248
actually prefers her desserts
on the larger side.

222
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,077
If that's something
you could possibly accommodate.

223
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,043
I'll give you a few minutes.

224
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,205
Thank you. Sorry.

225
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,553
I can't believe you just did that.

226
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,130
Oh, shut up. You love it.

227
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,255
Right. I'm going for a smoke. Stinky?

228
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,643
No. Don't smoke anymore.

229
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,307
And yet, you're still on fire.

230
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,476
Hmm.

231
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,562
Yeah, I don't know. Just...

232
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:33,524
May I suggest flushing it again
but harder? Okay, bye.

233
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,951
Hi, how can I help you?

234
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,509
Hey, how you doing? I was
wondering if y'all had a fax machine.

235
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,278
Fax machine?

236
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,284
Oh, okay. Um, that's a good question.
If you bear with me a second,

237
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,881
I'll just check with a colleague
and see what I can find out.

238
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,748
A fax machine, hey? Are you
sending something to the year 1997?

239
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,315
Yeah, just a little note to myself
telling me to buy Apple stock.

240
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,798
Oh. Good idea.

241
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,243
Can you tell me to murder J.K. Rowling and
write the first Harry Potter book as well?

242
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,009
Can do. Yeah. I'll probably write "handle"
instead of "murder,"

243
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,517
so there's no paper trail.

244
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,225
- Yeah, I'm Ted, by the way.
- Oh. Sassy.

245
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,397
Sassy, huh? Like the Smurf, right?

246
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,206
Don't think there was a Sassy Smurf,
was there?

247
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,230
That's too bad.

248
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,155
Seems like a Smurf with an attitude
would've been a lot of fun to watch.

249
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,361
All right, yeah, I'll tell him.
Let me know how the trial goes. Okay, bye.

250
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,658
Right, we no longer have a fax machine
on the premises.

251
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,912
But the concierge was able to locate one

252
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,413
at a tanning salon eight miles away
in Croxteth.

253
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,706
You know what, that's okay.

254
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,789
I'm just gonna hit this manicurist
nearby that has carrier pigeons.

255
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,259
- Thank you though. All right.
- Okay.

256
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,918
Nice meeting you.

257
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,764
Right, how can I help you?

258
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,841
Well, I was gonna go out for a smoke

259
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,097
and hope my friend picks up the check
while I was gone.

260
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,884
Then I saw Magnum, P.I. in line,
figured I'd flirt with him as well.

261
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,595
- See what happens, you know?
- Oh, well, good luck.

262
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,015
Yeah, I think I fucked it.

263
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,942
I... I actually get off in about 30 minutes
if you'd like to, uh...

264
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,197
Of course not, why would you?

265
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,032
You are who you choose to be.

266
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,447
Superman.

267
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,785
Okay, so I just met
the fucking Marlboro Man in the...

268
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,706
- Where's Stinky gone? She abandoned you?
- No, she just went to pee.

269
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,297
- Oh.
- Where does "Stinky" come from?

270
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,221
I remember the day
she moved into our town.

271
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,260
She was already taller than me,
had bigger boobs.

272
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,392
Family was rich.
So, first day of year seven,

273
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,143
I told everyone her nickname was "Stinky."

274
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,643
That's genius.

275
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,225
To the ties that bind us.

276
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,523
To Rebecca.

277
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,818
Yeah, that's not Rebecca.

278
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,953
How do you mean?

279
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,283
No, the real Rebecca is silly.

280
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,529
Strong, yeah, but not cold.

281
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,494
- Have you ever heard her sing?
- No.

282
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,118
Ah. Beautiful voice.

283
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,211
Her and Nora would sing through
the door for hours.

284
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,290
Do you wanna build a snowman?

285
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,206
- Who's Nora?
- My daughter.

286
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,495
Oh, yeah.

287
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,128
Yeah, if you like that woman,
you are gonna love Rebecca.

288
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,302
- Ready?
- What about the bill?

289
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,884
- Thank you, Miss Welton.
- Okay.

290
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,034
Do you wanna do that thing
where you pretend you wanted to pay?

291
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,979
Oh, yeah, yeah.
This is really good fun. Join in.

292
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,153
Oh, you absolute piece of shit!
I was about to do that!

293
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,126
- I was just about to get my card out.
- I can't believe that you've done this.

294
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,150
- We were gonna split. That was so nice.
- Six years I've waited for this...

295
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,096
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm... I'm so sorry. I just...

296
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
You're what?

297
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,081
- What is this?
- It's just my thoughts on the team.

298
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,246
Go, Nathan. Come on, it's past curfew.

299
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,796
- Go! Get outta here!
- Sorry.

300
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,768
Liverpool has much to offer
when it comes to nightlife.

301
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:45,567
From pubs and clubs,
to the great Asian pastime of karaoke!

302
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:50,033
And if you're the artsy type,
or you're just trying to impress a date,

303
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,947
Liverpool has more
museums and galleries...

304
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,163
Welcome to Goodison Park.
I'm Arlo White here with Chris Powell.

305
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,957
- Okay, guys! Got some snacks here!
- Whoo-hoo!

306
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,381
Let's try not to eat them all
in the first half. Come on, Richmond!

307
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,052
It's eighth-place Everton
hosting AFC Richmond,

308
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,011
in 18th and staring relegation
in the face.

309
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,222
The last time Richmond left here
with a win,

310
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:14,984
the number one song in the UK
was by Elvis Presley, "It's Now or Never."

311
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,477
And that's certainly the case
for Ted Lasso's men tonight.

312
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,484
- Nate, can I speak with you, please?
- Yeah.

313
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,283
You all right?

314
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:31,581
I wanted to apologize for last night.
I bit your head off for no good reason,

315
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,097
and I'm really sorry about that
and I hope you can forgive me.

316
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,326
Yeah, of cour... Yes, of course.

317
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:40,962
Thank you.
Also, I read through your thoughts.

318
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,962
- Yeah.
- They're great.

319
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,546
And I agree with every last one of 'em.

320
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,511
But I can't say this to them.

321
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,591
- But they need to hear it.
- I agree.

322
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,586
That's why you're gonna do it.

323
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,554
Are you drunk?

324
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,269
You're giving the pregame talk,
and you're gonna read them this.

325
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,522
- I ju... I don't know.
- It'll be fun.

326
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,034
No. No, no, no.

327
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,316
Oh, my God.

328
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,145
All right, listen up, fellas.

329
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:12,028
As of late, I feel like y'all
have heard enough of my jibber-jabber.

330
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,365
So I asked Nate the Great here to
jot down a few of his thoughts and ideas

331
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,162
about you guys and today's game.

332
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,365
So let's focus up.

333
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:20,084
- All yours, Nate.
- Okay.

334
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,964
- Let's go, Nate.
- Come on, boy. You got this.

335
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,049
- You got this, Nate. It's okay.
- Okay. Thank you. Let's do it.

336
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,311
- Isaac.
- Hmm?

337
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,516
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you got this, bruv, all right?

338
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,653
Yeah.

339
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,058
I've noticed of late...

340
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,355
that you've been playing
like a big, dumb pussy.

341
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:55,991
Wow.

342
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,346
What the fuck did you say to me, bruv?

343
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,463
You're more concerned about looking tough
than actually being tough.

344
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,727
There's a way to be intimidating
without being physical.

345
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,590
I hope you don't mind me saying.

346
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,920
Um...

347
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:09,835
- Sam.
- Oh, no.

348
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,803
You're constantly getting beat
on the wings.

349
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,068
It's 'cause you're indecisive.

350
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,853
You second-guess
more than a shitty psychic.

351
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,990
The only African I know more imprisoned
by their own thoughts

352
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,345
is goddamn Nelson Mandela.

353
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,102
Did you hear that?

354
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,124
You think that's funny, do you, Colin?
You and all your fancy step over bullshit.

355
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,827
Let me ask you this.
Do you wax your pubes?

356
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,569
What?

357
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,921
Did I stutter, dickhead?
Do you wax your pubes? Yes or no.

358
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,984
No.

359
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,270
Then why are you always trying to play
like a Brazilian?

360
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Yeah.

361
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,242
What just happened?

362
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,536
- Uh, Rojas.
- Whoo! Roast me, amigo.

363
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,672
All right.
You say that football is life, right?

364
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,249
Football is life.

365
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,753
- Yeah, well, then your defense is death.
- Oh!

366
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,898
The only person I've seen lose their man
more often is Carrie fucking Bradshaw.

367
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,762
Oh!

368
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,641
- Sex and the City.
- Shh.

369
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,255
- Yeah.
- Tough but fair.

370
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,636
Right. Roy.

371
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,238
Go on. Say what you're gonna say.

372
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,775
Okay.

373
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,282
Don't read it.

374
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,866
Say it to my face.

375
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,500
The great Roy Kent.

376
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,335
You're old now.

377
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:33,164
And slow. And your focus drifts.

378
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,936
But your speed and your smarts
were never what made you who you are.

379
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:39,763
It's your anger. That's your superpower.

380
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,967
That's what made you one of the best
midfielders in the history of this league.

381
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,559
But I haven't seen it on the pitch
at all this season, Roy.

382
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:48,273
I mean, you used to run
like you were angry at the grass.

383
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,684
You'd kick the ball like you'd caught it
fucking your wife, for Christ's sake.

384
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,653
But that anger doesn't come out anymore
when you play.

385
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,197
But it's still in there.

386
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,273
And I'm afraid of what it's gonna do to
you if you just keep it all for yourself.

387
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,559
Ooh!

388
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,145
Let's go get these fuckers.

389
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,574
See? Told you it'd be fun.

390
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:53,630
And the impossible has happened.
Richmond have won at Everton 1-0.

391
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,011
- Yes, Ted! Yeah!
- Thanks to a rare goal from Roy Kent.

392
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,680
Kent was absolutely brilliant today.

393
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,888
He was like a man possessed.

394
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,218
Yeah!

395
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,055
We know we are, we're sure we are.

396
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,809
We're Richmond till we die.

397
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,452
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond...

398
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:09,557
Oh, my God!

399
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,936
Come on, give us a hug, Nate. Yeah.

400
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,571
- Ted!
- Hey!

401
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,436
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, boss.

402
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,777
Could I, uh, just introduce you to...

403
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,991
- Sassy Smurf!
- Marlboro Man! Oh, my God.

404
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,488
We know we are, we're sure we are...

405
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,290
- I didn't know you were here.
- Surprise!

406
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:30,291
I've been thinking about you a lot
this weekend.

407
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:31,834
Oh, yeah? How come?

408
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,497
'Cause you and your crazy hair keep
popping up every time I turn on my TV.

409
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,472
Oi! Listen up!

410
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,429
None of you are going back
to the hotel tonight.

411
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:48,063
'Cause we did something today that
no one thought we could do, including us!

412
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,060
So, we're going out, we're celebrating,

413
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,482
and we're gonna rub it
in this city's fucking face!

414
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,112
Roy! Roy! Where are we going?

415
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,148
Keeley?

416
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,450
Well, Liverpool has much to offer.

417
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:09,584
From pubs to clubs
to the great Asian pastime of...

418
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:14,042
-I said maybe
-Said maybe

419
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,546
You're gonna be the one that saves me

420
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,337
Saves me

421
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:23,393
And after all

422
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:29,732
You're my wonderwall

423
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,226
I'm going for a smoke.

424
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,941
- Can I join you?
- Come on.

425
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,651
Thank you, Richmond FC!

426
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,237
So, what's Marlboro Man's story, then?

427
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,961
'Cause I kinda wanna grab him by the ears

428
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,701
and ride that little mustache
like a Jet Ski.

429
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,123
- It's so good to see you, Sass.
- You too, Stinky.

430
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,419
God. You know, today would've been my...

431
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,378
Of course I know.
Why do you think I'm here?

432
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:00,875
Mate, I'm so sorry.

433
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:04,967
I'm sorry for disappearing from you,
from Nora.

434
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,803
I really am.

435
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,057
Thank you for saying that.

436
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,430
Mm.

437
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,596
God, that man took so much from me.

438
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,402
No.

439
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:20,608
Rupert is a horrible man who built
an ivory tower he kept you captive in.

440
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:25,112
But you climbed every single step
of that tower on your own.

441
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,528
You're the one who stopped
coming home, stopped calling.

442
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,866
Who made a six-year-old girl
wonder what she'd done wrong.

443
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,709
I'll always be your biggest defender,

444
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,789
but you have to own up
to the part that you played.

445
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,454
You're right.

446
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,045
Course I'm right. I'm always right.

447
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,148
You're not always right.
Most of the time you're an arse.

448
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,883
There you are. Fucking hell.
I thought you guys ditched me.

449
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,427
- No!
- As if!

450
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,391
Jesus, I didn't know that
I had abandonment issues till right now.

451
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,103
Come on, Rebecca. Your song's up next.

452
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,103
- What?
- Yeah.

453
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,644
No, I didn't put a song in.

454
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,356
Well, then someone else
must've done it for you.

455
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,769
Who could've done that?

456
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,107
See? You are an arse.

457
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,742
Caught in a bad romance

458
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,661
Ra-ra-ah-ah-ah Roma-roma-ma

459
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,830
Gaga, ooh-la-la

460
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,289
Want your bad romance

461
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,666
All right, who's next?

462
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,211
Me, me, me.

463
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,297
Your turn, Rebecca. Get on up here.

464
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,131
Thank you. Oh, God.

465
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:30,467
Okay. Uh, I don't even know
what song I'm singing.

466
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:34,223
But I would like to dedicate it to
the best friend a girl could ever have.

467
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,978
That is me! She's talking about me!

468
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:46,025
This is also dedicated
to my goddaughter, Nora.

469
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,653
I love you.

470
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,737
The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight

471
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,616
Not a footprint to be seen

472
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:03,247
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

473
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:11,549
The wind is howling
Like this swirling storm inside

474
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:17,805
Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I've tried

475
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:26,028
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be

476
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:32,199
Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know

477
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,582
Well, now they know

478
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:39,211
Let it go, let it go

479
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,499
Can't hold it back anymore

480
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:46,134
Let it go, let it go

481
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:50,222
Turn away and slam the door

482
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:56,720
I don't care what they're going to say

483
00:25:56,807 --> 00:26:00,727
Let the storm rage on

484
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,730
The cold never bothered me anyway

485
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,172
- Ted.
- Dad?

486
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,665
Ted?

487
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,085
Ted.

488
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,263
It's okay.

489
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,921
It's okay.

490
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:32,589
Try to breathe.

491
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:37,096
I can't. I don't know what's going on.
I'm... I'm sorry.

492
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:40,560
It's okay. You're having a panic attack.
Just breathe.

493
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:43,983
Am I going crazy?

494
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,396
No more than anyone else.

495
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:50,782
All right. You're all right.

496
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:57,873
There we go. There we go.
There we go. Come on.

497
00:26:58,743 --> 00:26:59,753
Come on.

498
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,955
There we go.

499
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,461
I think I need to call it a night.

500
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:13,006
Gonna go back to the hotel and
just get a good night's rest, you know?

501
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,010
Would you like me to walk back with you?

502
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:16,945
Do you want to take my car?

503
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,849
No, no, no. I'm okay.
Thank you though. I appreciate it.

504
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,682
- All right.
- Okay.

505
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:29,613
Hey, do me a favor. Just, uh, let Beard
know I went back to the hotel.

506
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,240
Of course. You just get home safely.

507
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:33,648
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

508
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:35,695
Okay.

509
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,114
- Excuse me. Very drunk man coming through.
- Yeah.

510
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:58,453
Guys. Guys, guys, guys. I think
we should take the boys to the pub.

511
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,741
Oh, I am so done, Sass. Sorry.

512
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,904
Think I'm tapping out
for the evening too, actually.

513
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:08,084
So I have to take 18
young, handsome men all by myself?

514
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,954
Oh, trauma.

515
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,422
- All right then. See you later.
- Bye. I love you.

516
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:15,423
Amigos, I can't find my tropical shirt.

517
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:16,506
He's so drunk.

518
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,680
You won't need it, you won't need it.

519
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,429
Right, want a lift back to the hotel?

520
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,770
Oh, no.
Um, I think I'm gonna walk, actually.

521
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,079
Unless you want me to come with you,
'cause that I can do.

522
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,364
- I'm fine. Really.
- Yeah?

523
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,529
Besides, that was yesterday.

524
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:40,417
- You're wasting valuable time.
- Yeah, yeah. I'm going, I'm going.

525
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,636
Oh, this is me.

526
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:06,347
I'm sharing a suite with Rebecca.
We've got separate bedrooms though.

527
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,069
Good night.
