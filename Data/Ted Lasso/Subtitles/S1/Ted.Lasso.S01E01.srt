[whistle blowing]

00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,346
[man] Come on! Come on! Let's do this!

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,388
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

6
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:13,641
Go! Go! Go!

00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,679
[song continues]

00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,526

00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,714
Oh. [clears throat]

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,380
Rupert and I bought this
on our fifth anniversary.

12
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,335
Well, you have exquisite taste.

13
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,603
[chuckles] Do you want it?

14
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,136
But it's a Hockney.
It must be worth a million pounds.

15
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,977
Good point. You should've said yes.

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,862
-Auction pile, please.
-[man 2] Right away, ma'am.

17
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,895
[winces]

18
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,855
So, um, Mrs. Mannion--

19
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,027
Excuse me. Ms. Welton. [groans, chuckles]

20
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,584
George is here.

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,250
If he's here, why isn't he here?

22
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,958
Oh. Yes. Good point.

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,540
George.

24
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,285
-Higgy boy. [laughs]
-Oh! Good one.

25
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,049
Hey. I love what you've done to the place.

26
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,922
Did you do it yourself
or get some poof to help you?

27
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,138
I could ask the same of your hair. Please.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,760
-She's a cheeky one, isn't she, eh?
-[chuckles]

29
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,097
Right, love.
Listen, I've got training in a minute.

30
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,733
So whatever it is
you need to get off your impressive chest,

31
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,481
-let me have it.
-Of course.

32
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,563
You're fired.

33
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,017
[scoffs] Yeah, right.

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,647
And I'll be buying out
the remainder of your contract. So...

35
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,815
Wish you the best of luck.

36
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,123
Fired? What the fuck for?

37
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,162
[sighs]

38
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,953
I suppose I could go for
any number of reasons, really.

39
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,327
Your casual misogyny, for one.

40
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,245
-What?
-I know, it's a big word.

41
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,964
Ask one of your daughters what it means.

42
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,634
Or perhaps it's your performance,

43
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:12,631
having led this team through
yet another remarkably average season.

44
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,296
Or maybe it's because you insist
on wearing those tiny shorts

45
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,135
that force me to see
one of your testicles.

46
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,680
And there's the other one.

47
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,429
Liam and Noel.

48
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,519
Though, perhaps not an oasis.

49
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,192
Still, if I'm being
completely honest, George,

50
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,531
you're fired because I'm the owner now,
and I don't like you.

51
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,028
[scoffs]

52
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,949
Now do piss off, you fat twat.

53
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,992
Hey, Higgy boy.

54
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,485
What do you think's worse?

55
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,746
Your husband cheating on you
or being the last to know?

56
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,958
Is there someone that could pop out
and fetch me a salad?

57
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,554
[scoffs]

58
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,009
Nothing with raisins in it, please.

59
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,220
[George] Fuck you.

60
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,263
So, what to do as far as new managers go?

61
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,885
Shall I prepare a list of candidates?

62
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,643
No. That won't be necessary.

63
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,441
["SportsCenter" theme playing]

64
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,725
This is a bit of surprising news
from the other side of the Atlantic.

65
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,607
AFC Richmond announced
the hiring of their new manager,

66
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,945
one Theodore "Ted" Lasso.

67
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,410
Recently, it was Coach Lasso leading
the Division II Wichita State Shockers

68
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,333
to their first ever national title
in American football.

69
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,923
He took the Shockers
from a garbage program

70
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,919
all the way to the promised land
in his very first season as head coach.

71
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:34,012
But for a lot of us, that's not how
Ted Lasso found his way into our hearts,

72
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,589
certainly not into our living rooms.

73
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,224
-For me, it'll always be Ted...
-[cheering]

74
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,472
celebrating a moment of joy with his team

75
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,764
in a way that you really have to see
to understand.

76
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,348
And then, even when you see it...

[chanting, indistinct]

78
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,351

that understanding is what we're doing.

[cheering]

80
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,106
Right on, Ted. Do your thing, man.

81
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,531
And good luck
with the most beautiful game.

we call those selfies.

for doing something so stupid.

They say "into touch."

We'll be dimming the cabin shortly.

109
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,345
We should get some sleep.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,024
Hmm.

112
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,731
Are we nuts for doing this?

113
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,523
Yeah, this is nuts.

114
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,324
Hey, but taking on a challenge
is a lot like riding a horse, isn't it?

115
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,979
If you're comfortable
while you're doing it,

116
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,067
probably doing it wrong.

-Night, Coach.

No. My brain just kept on cooking.

00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,711
At first,
I was thinking about not sleeping.

127
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,421
Then I was thinking about thinking
about not sleeping. And that-- [sputters]

That's never good.

129
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:19,921
Next thing you know,

00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,795
they're handing out
warm chocolate chip cookies

00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,182
and the plane's landing.

132
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,338
I didn't get a cookie. Did you eat mine?

133
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,217
That's not part of the story.
I think this is us right here.

134

No, no, no, Ollie.
We packed 'em, we'll carry 'em.

we're not in Kansas anymore, right?

[both chuckle]

145
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,700
Hey, I've never actually said that
when not in Kansas before.

146
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,537
-That's kinda nice.
-Yeah.

147
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,455

[Ted] Right. Not the London Bridge,
'cause this one's still up.

151
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,934
You know how they came up with soccer?

152
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,602
So, these Victorian-era headmasters,

153
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,431
all they wanted to do
was get the boys to stop masturbating.

154
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:17,187
So they invented a sport where the boys
wouldn't use their hands at all,

155
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,061
and they thought that might do the trick.

156
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,817
I'm not sure if it worked, but...

157
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,577
Feels different, Coach.

158
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,337
I mean, the same, but different.

159
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,419
-Metaphor.
-You know it, baby.

Uh, this is Coach Beard here.

168
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,653
-[gasps] Oh, God. You're the new manager.
-Yes, sir.

169
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,399
-Take all the grass you want.
-Oh, no--

170
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,730
We just had it cut.
I can go through the garbage.

171
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,935
-I can get you some more.
-That's all right. No-No need.

172
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,531
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

173

-Oh, yeah.

174
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,492
-Still, we got to get off the grass.
-Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

175
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,406
Do we apologize?

176
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,123
-Sorry about that, grass.
-[Coach Beard] Sorry, grass.

177
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,084
[door closes]

178
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,083
So, we're supposed to meet
with a Rebecca Welton.

179
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,415
Yeah, that's where I'm taking you.

180
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,919
Oh. Look at this guy. One step ahead.

181
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,921
Hey, what's your name, by the way?

182
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,093
-Me?
-Yeah.

183
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,551
No one ever asks my name.

184
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,671
Oh.

185
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,140
I mean, whenever you're ready.

186
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,682
Oh, um, it's Nathan.

187
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,225
Nathan! Aw, I love that name.

188
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,388
Hey, love your hot dogs.

189
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,101
Yeah. No, I know.

190
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,606
Good, good.
Y'all got Nathan's hot dogs here?

191
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,688
No.

192
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:43,773
Okay.

193
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,993
I love this kid. Love him.

194
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,856
I'll introduce you. Big boss.

195
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:50,947
-Here we go.
-[knocking]

196
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,491
Hello.

197
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,949
[stammers]

198
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:06,256
Hey, how y'all doing?
I'm Ted Lasso, your new coach.

199
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:09,718
-You must be Ms. Welton.
-Oh. Please, call me Rebecca.

200
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,010
Ms. Welton's my father.

201
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,642
If that's a joke, I love it.

202
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,510
If not, I cannot wait
to unpack that with you.

203
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,056
This here is Coach Beard.

204
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,270
It is so good
to finally meet you both face-to-face.

205
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,192
Higgins?

206
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,900
Oh. Sorry. This is Higgins,
our current director of communications.

207
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:25,982
Current?

208
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,646
Could you take Coach Beard and get him
their IDs, housing information...

209
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,236
You know, anything they need.

210
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,121
-Wi-Fi password, wet wipes.
-Humidifier. Way ahead of you, Coach.

211
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,279
Thank you.

212
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,713
-Please, take a seat.
-Okay.

213
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,294
-Can I get you something to drink?
-Yes, please.

214
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,334
Didn't get much sleep on the plane,
so anything you got,

215
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,248
a little boost of caffeine,
should do the trick.

216
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,166
You know, mochaccino, Frappuccino...

217
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,005
Any coffee thing, as long as
I can't taste a hint of coffee, is good.

218
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,181
How do you take your tea?

219
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,761
Well, usually I take it
right back to the counter

220
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,805
'cause someone's
made a horrible mistake. But...

221
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:57,759
when in Rome, right?

222
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,439
Yeah. Look at that. Okay.

223
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,348
Mm. [slurps]

224
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,437
Mm-hmm.

225
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,230
Well?

226
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,275
You know, I always figured that tea
was just gonna taste like hot brown water.

227
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,529
And you know what?

228
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,321
I was right.
Yeah, it's horrible. No, thank you.

229
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,655
Welcome to England.

230
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,240
Yeah. "Get used to it, sucker." Right?

231
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,155
Now, would you like a tour?

232
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,623
-Ooh, I'd love to see Abbey Road.
-Of the club.

233
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:21,794
Yeah, let's start there.

234
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:26,882
So, this hall represents
the club's long, albeit modest, history.

235
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,800
The first match was played in 1897.

236
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,049
Uh, during the war, our stadium
was used as a makeshift hospital.

237
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,593
Yeah, some of the locals claim

238
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,676
they still see fallen soldiers
wandering around the pitch.

239
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,143
Ooh. That's spooky.

240
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,063
-Oh. Do you believe in ghosts, Ted?
-I do.

241
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,352
But more importantly, I think they need
to believe in themselves. You know?

242
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,268
Okay.

243
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,896
And this is a wall of our previous owners.

244
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,782
Okay. And now look at this fella up here.

245
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,407
How 'bout the girls
and the champagne and everything?

246
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,949
He looks like a good time.

247
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,242
That's my ex-husband.

248
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,745
Well, good times aren't always
a good time, I've found.

249
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,657
You know, I heard about all that.

250
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,037
How you holding up?

251
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,589
Yeah, hasn't been the easiest year.

252
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,709
Yeah.

253
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,088
-So, we'll need you to speak to the press.
-Oh, yeah.

254
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,843
No, after a couple nights' good sleep,
I'll be happy to do so.

255
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,426
I'm so sorry. I thought you knew.
They're ready for you now.

256
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,352
They're what?

257
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,719
[reporters clamoring]

258
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,017
So, without further ado,

259
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,980
the new manager of AFC Richmond,
Ted Lasso!

260
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,522
[scattered applause]

261
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,783
[clears throat] Okay.

262
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,702
All right. How y'all doing?

263
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:39,664
Oh.

264
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,794
There's Coach. Oluwa Ted, yo. [laughs]

265
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,161
Look, our coach.

266
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,207
Oi!

267
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,002
If I don't hear silence,
I'm gonna start punching dicks.

268
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,424
One sec. Let me just--
Throat got a little dry.

269
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,798
[grunts, coughs]

270
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,807
Did not expect fizzy water there. Sorry.

271
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,809
Look at this twat!

272
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,391
Fucking Yank!

273
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,385
Okay. So, uh, hey.

274
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,857
Why don't we just jump right in?
Anybody got any questions?

275
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,727
Oh, yeah, no. Should've saw that coming.

276
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,777
You know what?
You can put your hands down.

277
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:16,991
Real quick, um--

278
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,160
[softly] Yeah.

279
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,528
How about I go ahead and address

280
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,905
the larger-than-average elephant
in the room.

281
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:27,122
No, I have never coached the sport
that you folks call football at any level.

282
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,206
Jesus.

283
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:29,922
What?

284
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,880
Heck, you could fill two Internets
with what I don't know about football.

285
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,546
But I'll tell you what I do know.

286
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,681
I know that AFC Richmond,
like any team I've ever coached,

287
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,089
is gonna go out there
and give you everything they got

288
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,548
-for all four quarters.
-[man] Halves.

289
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,267
-What was that?
-Two halves.

290
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,599
Oh, right. Sorry. Halves, yeah.

291
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,563
They're gonna give you everything they got
for two halves, win or lose.

292
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,725
Or tie.

293
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,562
Right. Y'all do ties here.

294
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,778
Sorry. That's going to take
some getting used to for me.

295
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,688
'Cause back where I'm from,
you try to end a game in a tie,

296
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,858
well, that might as well
be the first sign of the apocalypse.

297
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,618
[giggles]

298
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,080
Now, look here.
I respect what you folks in the media do.

299
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,001
And my door is always gonna be open.

300
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,500
All right? You can ask me anything.
No topic will be into touch.

301
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,923
All right, one final question.

302
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,505
Uh, how about the fellow right there
in the second row.

303
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,588
Yeah.

304
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,715
I-I like your glasses.

305
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,640
Oh. Thank you.

306
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,684
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

307
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,011
I just wanna make sure I have this right.

308
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,388
You're an American
who's never set foot in England,

309
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,435
whose athletic success
has only come at the amateur level--

310
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,560
a second-tier one at that--

311
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,607
and is now being charged
with the leadership

312
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,231
of a Premier League football club,

313
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,607
despite clearly possessing
very little knowledge of the game.

314
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,070
You got a question in there, Trent?

315
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:44,946
Yeah.

316
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,204
Is this a fucking joke?

317
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,446
[reporters laughing]

318
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,867
-Thank you, Trent!
-I love journalists.

319
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
I mean, can you even name any footballers?

320
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,296
Well, yeah, you got Ronaldo
and the fellow that bends it like himself.

321
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,509
-Fucking Beckham! Made a film on it!
-You dickhead, mate.

322
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,760
Who the fuck are you?

323
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,971
Do you know how many games
are in a Premiership season?

324
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,221
Not off the top of my head, no.

325
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,683
[speaking French]

326
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,023
Nobody can understand you.

327
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,518
Who won the league last year?

328
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,560
I actually don't know the answer to that.
I'm sorry.

329
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,479
[male reporter 2] What's a goalie?

330
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,022
The fella with the big Mickey Mouse hands
and the-- by the net.

331
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,566
This is bleak.

332
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,149
You need to go back to America.

333
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,694
[overlapping shouts]

334
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,782
[no audible dialogue]

335
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,790
[echoing laughter]

336
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,659
Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. No, no, I--

337
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,619
-[snorts]
-[male reporter] Oh!

338
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,077
The bubbles!

339
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,087
Fucking hell!

340
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,511
Coach Lasso.

341
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,218
Good Lord.
You must forgive my fellow countrymen.

342
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,089
Somewhere over the last few years,

343
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,386
we seem to have abandoned
all sense of manners and hospitality.

344
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,971
My, my, aren't you a salty bunch?

345
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,017
But I can't remember the last time
the press room was this full.

346
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,520
Yet here you all are.

347
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,314
Maybe you're not such a mad notion
after all.

348
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,187
And despite the number of you here,

349
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,185
there is not a single person in this room

350
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,447
who has seen Richmond play
more than I have.

351
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,370
And in all those years under
the stewardship of the previous owner,

352
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,700
I've witnessed nothing
but profound mediocrity.

353
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,576
-[murmuring]
-[reporter chuckles]

354
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,291
Am I wrong?

355
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,253
Well, it's a bit harsh. [chuckle]

356
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,500
Am I wrong?

357
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,764
[softly] No.

358
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,640
Now, Coach Lasso may not have the CV
that you all find acceptable,

359
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,928
but he does have one thing
this club doesn't:

360
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,432
a trophy from this millennium.

361
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,885
So, like it or not, Richmond
are changing the way we do things.

362
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:38,057
And from now on,
that way is the "Lasso way."

363
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,779
We look forward to seeing you all
at our next match with Crystal Palace.

364
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,241
Thank you so much.

365
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,034
[reporters chattering]

366
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,374
Nice meeting y'all.

367
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,738
And, uh, sorry for spittin'
on all your stuff up here.

368
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,493
Thank you.

369
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,791
I give him three weeks.

370
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:59,253
[shudders] Oh, boy. I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what happened.

371
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,594
Ted, don't you think about them
for another second.

372
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,670
You have a job to do.

373
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,844
And proving them wrong,
just been added to the list.

374
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,683
I appreciate that-- Thank you, Coach.

375
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,758
Yeah.

376
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,013
[slurps] Mm.

377
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,104
See, I'm fine when there's no bubbles.
You know, I can do that all day.

378
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,806
[Ted exhales]

379
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,561
Okay. You know,
I'd love to say hi to the team, if I can.

380
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,653
Can't keep a gaffer from his pitch.

381
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,443
You can say that again. Okay.

382
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,074
I am 0 for 2 in that sentence.

383
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,284
Ms. Welton, I was a bit skeptical,

384
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,582
but after hearing you speak in there,
I'm excited by your choice.

385
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,988
Coach Lasso is just what we need.

386
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,367
Oh, he's an absolute wanker.

387
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:36,294
I know.

388
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,661
Eh, pardon?

389
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,208
I hope he fails miserably.

390
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:45,302
See, my ex-husband truly loved
only one thing his entire life: this club.

391
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:49,134
And Ted Lasso is gonna help me
burn it to the ground.

392
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,304
'Cause I want to torture Rupert.

393
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:57,352
I want him to feel like he's being fucked
in the ass with a splintered cricket bat.

394
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:01,564
Just in and out, over and over,
in a constant loop.

395
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,067
Like a GIF.

396
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,941
That's what GIFs do, isn't it?
They're just...

397
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,404
endless.

398
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,448
That's... [clears throat] correct.

399
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,079
Uh, though some people, um,
pronounce it "JIF."

400
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,668
-Thank you, Higgins.
-Thank you.

401
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,997
[footsteps departing]

402
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,134
Uh...

403
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,051
[Ted] Okay, let me use it in a sentence,
so it sticks.

404
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,298
The "gaffer"-- me--

405
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,971
-is going out to the "pitch"--
-Yeah.

406
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,509
-[whistle blows]
-...the grass here-- to watch practice.

407
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,432
"Training." They call practice "training."

408
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,511
All this vernacular. Gonna be tough.

409
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,136
You know what? I'm gonna get it though.
'Cause training makes perfect.

410
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,144
There you go.

411
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:39,809
Oh. There's our man.

412
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,861
[players yelling]

413
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,027
-[cheering]
-[player] Jesus, Mary and fuckface Joseph!

414
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,649
Eyes on the man you're marking! Come on!

415
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,026
-Ooh! Who is that?
-Roy Kent.

416
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,034
Team captain.
Classic old-school box-to-box midfielder.

417
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:58,407
-Definitely lost a step.
-But, you know, he's a legend.

418
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,115
Won a Champions League with Chelsea, so...

419
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,666
-Eight years ago.
-Yeah.

420
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,292
Mmm!

421
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,456
Oh, God, what?

422
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,633
That is a darn fine sports mix,
young fella.

423
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:09,844
Coach, you try this?

424
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,053
[slurps, swishes]

425
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:12,974
[gulps]

426
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,224
[chortles]

427
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,466
That does not come lightly
from that fella, I'll tell you that.

428
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,058
You continue to impress, Nathan.

429
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,691
You remembered my name.

430
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,194
-[man groans]
-Holy smokes! Did you see that?

431
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,284
That fella looked like a kitty cat
when it gets spooked by a cucumber.

432
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,400
-Who the heck is that?
-Jamie Tartt.

433
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,067
Top scorer on the team.

434
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,156
Fuck off.

435
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,910
-Hmm. Nate, what's he like?
-Who, Jamie?

436
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,873
-Mm-hmm.
-Eh, he's great.

437
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,035
You know, at football.

438
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,464
Yeah, I know fellas like that.

439
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,212
[Coach Beard] Sam Obisanya. He's a right
back defender outta the Nigerian league.

440
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,046
Nigeria? Like Africa?

441
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,932
So these fellas
are from all over the place?

442
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,089
I'm open, boyo.

443
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:56,597
I mean, he must be from England, yeah?

444
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,178
-Wales.
-Is that another country?

445
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,103
-Yes and no.
-How many countries are in this country?

446
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,353
-Four.
-Four.

447
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,228
It's kinda like America these days.

448
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:06,864
Right.

449
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,833
I do love a locker room.

450
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,325
Smells like potential.

451
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,713
And am I getting notes of Axe body spray?

452
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,344
-Spot on, Coach.
-Mm.

453
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,260
But I think they call it
something else here.

454
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,135
Oh.

455
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,313
-Ding, ding, ding.
-Ah!

456
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:44,849
Lynx.

457
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,154
My favorite of the jungle cats.

458
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,939
[players chattering]

459
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,320
Come here. Look at your face.
Look at your face.

460
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,493
[Nathan] Thanks, thanks.

461
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:58,701
[chattering continues]

462
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,752
Yeesh.

463
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,212
Last time I saw eyes that cold,

464
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,292
they were going head-to-head
with Roy Scheider.

465
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,337
-Jaws?
-No, All That Jazz.

466
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,301
I'm gonna say something. Howdy, fellas.

467
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,181
Don't stop what you're doing.

468
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,638
My name's Ted Lasso.
This here is Coach Beard.

469
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,679
I know we don't officially start
quite yet,

470
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,102
but, uh, you know,
we just wanted to pop in, say howdy,

471
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,062
let you know
how excited we are to be here--

472
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,272
[woman] Knock, knock.

473
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,311
Is everyone in here decent?

474
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,225
[chattering]

475
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,654
Oh, boys, that's disappointing.

476
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,903
[laughter, chattering]

477
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,954
Oh, shit. Am I interrupting you?

478
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:39,569
No, no, that's okay. How can I help you?

479
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,366
No, I'm here to pick up that one.

480
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,870
Yeah. Sorry, Coach.

481
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,121
She made me an appointment.
I'm getting waxed.

482
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,294
-[players jeer]
-[wolf whistle]

483
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,121
It's more for the fans than it is for me.

484
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,827
Score a goal, gotta take my shirt off.

485
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,498
Sweetheart.

486
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,089
I mean, I can stay if you want.

487
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,381
No, that's okay.

488
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,876
All right, cheers.

489
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,297
-Yeah.
-There you go.

490
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,345
All right, kid, after you.

491
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,218
You're gonna be a gentleman now, are you?

492
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,055
No, babe. Just gonna watch your ass.

493
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,681
Fuck off.

494
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,348
Watch it and weep.

495
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,857
[players chattering]

496
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,452
Anyhoo, uh, thank you for your time.

497
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,791
[upbeat R&B music playing]

498
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:46,313
[song continues]

499
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,372
[song ends]

500
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,078
-Coach. You gotta stay up.
-[groans]

501
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,204
Come on, man. Don't be a sleep cop.

502
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
[sighs]

503
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,171
Roy! Hey, Roy!

504
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:17,628
Yeah? What do you want?

505
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:19,923
It was real fun
watching you out there today.

506
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,257
You know, the boys really respond to you.

507
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,682
It doesn't surprise me though.
You've had a heck of a career.

508
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:26,354
Thank you.

509
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,510
Mm-hmm.

510
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:31,436
Never thought it would end
being coached by Ronald fucking McDonald.

511
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,438
You gonna let him call you that?

512
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,947
I don't think he was referring to me.

513
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:45,492
Hmm. He thinks he's mad now,
wait till we win him over.

514
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,741
He'll be furious.

515
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,077
You got any tape?

516
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,434
[clears throat]

517
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,615
[in deep voice] What you doing in there?

518
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,408
-[groans]
-Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Are you all right?

519
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:30,993
Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

520
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,248
I shouldn't laugh.

521
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,869
It's okay.

522
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:37,916
No, I was just making some adjustments
to the locker room here.

523
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,501
Nice, yeah.

524
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:43,046
Though, I believe it's crooked.

525
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,684
Now here I am thinking it was the room
that was all outta whack.

526
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,100
But you know what? I think you're right.

527
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,812
[chuckles]

528
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,678
What you doing back here? Where's Jamie?

529
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,265
Oh, he left his phone in his locker.

530
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,940
Why didn't he come get it?

531
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,438
He's still getting waxed.
He's surprisingly furry.

532
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,481
The hair was, like, growing back
while she was doing it.

533
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,937
-Come on, now.
-[laughs] May I?

534
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,775
-Yeah, yeah. Help yourself.
-Thanks.

535
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,412
Lower it down on that side.

536
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:14,495
Oh. Great.

537
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,750
Keep going. Little bit.

538
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:17,665
Teeny bit more.

539
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,329
Stop! That's perfect.

540
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,918
All right. How 'bout that? Nice teamwork.

541
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,553
-Pow. Yeah.
-Old-school.

542
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,091
-I'm Keeley, by the way.
-Oh, yeah. Hey, I'm Ted Lasso.

543
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,296
No, I know. You're trending hard
on Twitter right now.

544
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:30,546
How 'bout that.

545
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,931
-Do you even tweet?
-Nah.

546
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,425
But I do beatbox all right.

547
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,350
[beatboxing]

548
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,363
[pop]

549
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,817
I never know how to react
when a grown man beatboxes in front of me.

550
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,864
Well, I hope
you never run into Biz Markie.

551
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,367
[soft chuckle]

552
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,739
All right.

553
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,695
Well, if you get curious and you start
searching around on Twitter,

554
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,326
I would avoid #Richmond.

555
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,463
-Okay.
-Or wanker. Or dick.

556
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,753
-Well, I'll take your word for it.
-Oh.

557
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:04,843
Welcome to England.

558
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,806
Thank you.
Hey, and thanks again for the lift.

559
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,850
That's all right.

560
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,563
Hey, this you, Nate?

561
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:19,523
Oh, that one? God, no.
No, couldn't handle that.

562
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,103
This is me. Green one here.

563
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,568
Right. So, get that in there.

564
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:24,649
Come on.

565
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:27,363
Already burning the midnight oil,
I see, Ted.

566
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,654
Well, as the man once said,

567
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,317
"The harder you work,
the luckier you get," huh?

568
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,199
[Nathan] On the diagonal.

569
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,243
My apologies, Ted.
We should have ordered you a car.

570
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:36,657
Oh, no. That's okay.

571
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,825
-Night, y'all.
-[Coach Beard] Got it.

572
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:40,332
[gags, clears throat]

573
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,375
What is wrong with you?

574
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,589
It's just that everything
I've eaten today...

575
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,456
feels like it's stuck right here.

576
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:48,758
[Coach Beard grunts]

577
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:50,758
I got it. I got it.

578
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,723
[grunting]

579
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:53,803
Here we go.

580
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:57,177
He seems like such a nice man.
I'm not sure I can do this.

581
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,392
Obviously, for this to work,

582
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:04,857
I'm going to need the full support
of my new director of football operations.

583
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:08,278
I'm assuming that's a promotion
and substantial pay rise

584
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,860
that would be of interest to you
and your family.

585
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,318
[horn honking]

586
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,527
Hey, look, this car's got
an invisible steering wheel!

587
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:17,617
[honking]

588
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:18,663
I'm just kidding.

589
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,455
It's my man Nate here running the horn.

590
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,169
You're a godsend, Ted Lasso.

591
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,090
[chuckles] Takes one to know one.

592
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,839
-[honking]
-[chuckling]

593
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,756
Well?

594
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,302
I accept.

595
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,505
Wonderful.

596
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,139
[exhales]

597
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,135
Oh, and, uh, Higgins,

598
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:45,017
I know that there'll be elements
to this little adventure

599
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,395
that will weigh on you a bit.

600
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,731
But, uh, I'm sure it won't be harder
than it was

601
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,817
to sneak all Rupert's women in and out
behind my back all those years.

602
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,451
[engine starts]

603
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,121
[Higgins gags, groans]

604
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:08,299
This is you, Coach.

605
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:11,548
Okay. All right. You good?

606
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:13,222
-I'm good. You good?
-Yeah.

607
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,470
-Night, Coach.
-Good night, Coach.

608
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,011
Oh. I almost forgot.

609
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,814
What's this for?

610
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,559
-"Into touch."
-Get some sleep, Coach.

611
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:21,851
Yeah, I will.

612
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:57,927
[exhales]

613
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:06,135
[clears throat]

614
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,566
Hey, big guy. How you doing?
How was school today?

615
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:13,863
Right.

616
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:15,534
Ah, no, I-I forgot.

617
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,872
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a little loopy today.

618
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,776
Yeah. Yeah, you could say that.

619
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,288
[chuckles]

620
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,789
No, no, that's okay. No.
I just wanted to hear your voice.

621
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,422
Yeah. Yeah, go do your thing. Yeah.

622
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,078
Hey, is your mom there?

623
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,246
Okay. Thanks, big guy.

624
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:31,415
Hey, I miss you.

625
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,547
Yeah, I love you too.

626
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,258
Okay.

627
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,098
Hey, how you doing?

628
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,440
Yeah. Well, you know,
so far so good. You know?

629
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:55,188
[stammers] It's gonna take
some getting used to, yeah.

630
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:57,947
But-But I think once we get going,
it's gonna go all right.

631
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:01,414
Yeah. No, that's true, that's true. Yeah.

632
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,996
Well, you know what?
It's actually pretty nice. Yeah.

633
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:08,833
Yeah, and tell you what,
they got a cute neighborhood too.

634
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:09,916
Yeah.

635
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,380
Yeah, you and the little guy
gotta get on over here.

636
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:13,631
Come check it out.

637
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:19,934
What? No, what did I say?

638
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:26,142
But that's what I'm doing though.
I'm giving you that space.

639
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:28,768
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

640
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,652
Yeah, and myself. Right. Uh-huh.

641
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:33,688
Okay.

642
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,441
No, no. That's okay. Yeah, yeah.

643
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:37,777
Hey, hey, Michelle.

644
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:40,414
I love you.

645
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,369
No, no, that's okay. You don't have to.

646
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,621
Really. Yeah.

647
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:53,591
Okay.

648
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:55,878
Uh-huh.

649
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,763
All right, now. Good night.

650
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:03,511
[phone clicks]

651
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,944
Shoot. Now I can't sleep.
