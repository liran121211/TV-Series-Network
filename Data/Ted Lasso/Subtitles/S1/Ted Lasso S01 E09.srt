perform live, you know?

- It does give me the toots though.

straight into my face.

But truth be told, as long as
they let Carlton do his thing,

528
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:55,220
I was always gonna take a
minute and just sit right there.

the Carlton in front of me.

Why don't we just say you're injured,
you can't play? No shame in that.

543
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:29,923
That would help protect my stock
if I wanna move next season.

544
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:32,799
Maybe to a club that
actually wants to start me.

having to play in fucking America,

is this football then?"

would be to have you there.
