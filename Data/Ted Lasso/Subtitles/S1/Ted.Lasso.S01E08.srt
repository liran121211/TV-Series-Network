00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,840
By not trying for sex?

176
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:33,762
Sometimes that is exactly how it works.

177
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,306
Ah. I never knew that.

178
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,558
[KEELEY LAUGHS]

179
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,395
- Morning, boss.
- [CHUCKLES]

180
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,815
Now, you don't just get biscuits today.

181
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,652
I also got you a little
box of chocolate truffles.

182
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,789
- Oh, you fucker. Don't do this to me.
- [TED CHUCKLES]

183
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,417
What you should do is
take one of them truffles

184
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:54,830
and smoosh it in between
the biscuits like

185
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,326
it's a little breakfast sandwich...

186
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,286
Yeah, there you go. You got it.

187
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,080
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- [MOANS]

188
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,394
Yeah. And hey,

189
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:04,751
I wanna thank you again for
being there for me up in Liverpool.

190
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,004
- Oh. It was nothing, Ted.
- No, no. It was something.

191
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,924
You got a coupon for life, young
lady. Yeah. I got your back.

192
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:14,302
Think of me as your own personal
metaphorical Saint Bernard.

193
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,972
You don't need to be dealing
with a metaphorical avalanche

194
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:20,308
to avail yourself to the metaphorical
bourbon hanging around my neck.

195
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,018
Metaphorically speaking. Okay?

196
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,103
All right now.

197
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,938
- Oh! Actually, Ted.
- Mm.

198
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,857
If you do want to be there for me,

199
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:30,193
I have a meeting later with
two minority owners of the club.

200
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,278
The Milk sisters.

201
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,488
The most horrible human cocktail

202
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,075
of being terribly dull and
yet, they never shut up.

203
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,159
Please join me.

204
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,411
Done and doner.

205
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:43,123
[EXHALES] Perfect. I can
just introduce you all,

206
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,917
leave you wittering on, and
slip out and do anything else.

207
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,127
How much of the club they own?

208
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,378
2.9%.

209
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,984
I'm gonna round that down to two.

210
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:52,382
Then I can call those
gals the "2% Milks".

211
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,050
Oh, God. They're gonna adore you.

212
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,812
It's gonna be fun. All right.
I'll leave you be. See ya now.

213
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,600
In my experience, I've always
found that endorsements work best

214
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,101
if you really believe in the product.

215
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,958
So, I can find good
opportunities for you guys

216
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,606
if you let me know what you're into.

217
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,818
I love Air Jordans.

218
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,735
I'd fuck a pair of Jordans.

219
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,528
All right. So, athletic wear then, yeah?

220
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,614
I'm into issue-oriented products.

221
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,490
You know, pro-environment
or anti-pollution.

222
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,617
That kind of thing.

223
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,493
Oh, and also Air Jordans.

224
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,287
- But I don't want to sleep with them.
- [KEELEY] Mm-hmm.

225
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,830
Isaac, what about you?

226
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,208
Uh, Rolos.

227
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,628
So, sweets and chocolate then?

228
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,881
No. Just Rolos, yeah?

229
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,467
And none of that Sour
Patch bullshit either, yeah?

230
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,593
Okay.

231
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,135
Well, that's a great start
from you guys. Thank you.

232
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,350
[ISAAC] Hey, Captain.

233
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,311
What's all this?

234
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,230
Oh, Rebecca's letting me
use this room as my office

235
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,656
until she sets me up
with somewhere proper.

236
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,024
That's why I have this.

237
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,317
So if they need to use the room,

238
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,777
I can just shove everything into it.

239
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,446
Efficient. Do you want
to see a movie later?

240
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,474
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What?

241
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,784
I asked you if you wanted to
go get coffee with me yesterday

242
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,619
- and you said you were busy.
- I was busy.

243
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,121
- You never texted me back last night.
- Yeah. I was busy.

244
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,123
What about the kiss? You took
off like it was a shit kiss,

245
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,084
and it was not a shit
kiss. I was on fire.

246
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,962
- I agree.
- So what is your fucking problem, Roy?

247
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,381
Listen, I'm a professional footballer.

248
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,591
I have had a million one-night stands.

249
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,676
- So have I.
- Great.

250
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,594
- I don't know why we're bragging about it.
- Neither do I.

251
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,681
And they always feel empty.
Well, not the first part.

252
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,724
- No, at first they're wicked.
- They're fucking great.

253
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,102
- But when it's all done, I feel like...
- Like shit.

254
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,230
Exactly. And I always end up
with my watch being stolen

255
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,691
or a story in the press about
how my penis has a curve in it.

256
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,768
Does it actually?

257
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,986
No, I just make it feel
like it does with my hips.

258
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,778
Anyway, the point is, I'm
trying to do this differently.

259
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,534
I should have told
you that. I apologize.

260
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:49,291
And I am trying to be more honest.

261
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,293
Thank you.

262
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,094
Okay, then.

263
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,965
[SIGHS] I think you should
know that I slept with Jamie.

264
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,133
Yes, I am aware of that.

265
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,505
I mean last night.

266
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,971
I didn't think you were into me.

267
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,473
I didn't know what you wanted,
and I knew exactly what he wanted.

268
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,822
So you fucked him to get back at me

269
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:08,226
for something I didn't even know I did.

270
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,563
[SCOFFS] No. I... No.

271
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,731
No.

272
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,316
Yes.

273
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,318
Yup. That's exactly what I did.

274
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,570
[GRUNTS SOFTLY]

275
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,992
I fucked up, Roy. I'm really sorry.

276
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,159
But I need you to be okay with this.

277
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,411
[GRUNTS]

278
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,997
Um, well, why don't you just come
and tell me how you feel about it

279
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,679
once you've figured out
how to speak again?

280
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,133
[GRUNTS]

281
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,755
[DOOR SLAMS]

282
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,349
Hi, Roy.

283
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,140
[GRUNTS]

284
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,188
Something on your mind?

285
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,606
[GRUNTS]

286
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,359
Is that grunt all I get to go on?

287
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,028
That's okay. I'll give it
a shot here. Uh, let's see.

288
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,950
You are thinking about
buying your first house.

289
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,283
No, not that. Okay.

290
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,578
You just realized your dad
might be a little racist.

291
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,206
Stop. He's in his 60s and
he's from South London.

292
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,624
Of course my dad's a little racist.

293
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,460
Look, me and Keeley might
be starting up a thing,

294
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,964
but every time I think about her,

295
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,800
all I think about is
Jamie fucking Tartt.

296
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,718
Ooh-whee!

297
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,794
Sounds to me like
someone's trapped inside

298
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:27,681
life's most complicated shape.

299
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:28,765
A love triangle.

300
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,018
Second place of course is the "I
just walked in on my mother-in-law

301
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,187
changing into her
swimsuit" dodecahedron.

302
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,982
Does my face look like it's in
the mood for shape-based jokes?

303
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,984
No, Roy, it does not.

304
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,027
But, in my defense, it rarely does.

305
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,069
Oh. I know exactly
what to do here, though.

306
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,657
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

307
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,742
Don't you fret, my fine furry fella.

308
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,848
In a matter of minutes,

309
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,788
your relationship dilemma
will be in the past.

310
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,666
For I am rounding up the Diamond Dogs.

311
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,376
Who the fuck are the Diamond Dogs?

312
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,753
It's just a group of
people who care, Roy.

313
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,568
Not unlike folks at a hip-hop concert

314
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,965
whose hands are not in the air.

315
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,676
Okay, so this is about
you and Keeley, right?

316
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,888
- Saw this coming.
- Nothing like the early days of courtship.

317
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,681
Okay, this is my fucking nightmare.

318
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,601
I think the idea of you and Keeley
is like cookies and cream.

319
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,110
And I think we all agree,

320
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:15,979
two great tastes that
go great together, right?

321
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,272
- [HIGGINS] Yeah.
- Perfect analogy.

322
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:20,108
Yes, I am into her. But we all
know who her ex-boyfriend is.

323
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,235
The prince prick of all pricks.

324
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,446
And I've got him stuck right in here.

325
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,906
I don't understand the problem.

326
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,657
I mean, Keeley's just so kind.

327
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,411
You know, to be liked by someone
like her must be... 's wonderful.

328
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,371
Mm. Shout out to the
Gershwin brothers right there.

329
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,789
[COACH BEARD] Fuck yeah, the Gershwins.

330
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,500
But dang it, fellas,
you're still not getting it!

331
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,542
Thank you.

332
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,505
Sure, Roy here has slept with a
bunch of different people in his past.

333
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,403
But Keeley's got her own romantic

334
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:45,634
and sexual history that predates Roy.

335
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:46,966
And that's not okay!

336
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,304
Oh, he means the opposite.

337
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,765
I love it when Coach does sarcasm.

338
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,308
I can't control my feelings.

339
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,603
Well, then by all means you
should let them control you.

340
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,396
Ah! He's doing it again.

341
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,148
[CHUCKLES] Good eye.

342
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,068
Look, Roy, all this Chandler
Bing-ing aside, do me a favor.

343
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,445
Don't let her past muck around
with y'all's future, okay?

344
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,567
