00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:05,916
[birds chirping]

2
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,886
[alarm buzzing]

3
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,983
[rock music playing]

4
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,905
[song continues]

5
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,168
Whoo!

6
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,295
Fuck!

7
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,849
-Siri, call Shithead.
-[phone beeps]

8
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,435
-[phone rings]
-Oh!

9
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:03,896
[with mouth full] Good morning.

10
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,861
[Rebecca] There is nothing in The Sun
about Ted and Keeley.

11
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,862
Nothing. Are you in your office?

12
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,154
Of course I am.

13
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,237
Then get up here now.

14
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:12,992
[sighs]

15
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,368
Bye, boys. Tell Mum I love her.

16
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,195
Knock, knock.
Hey, boss, I don't know about you,

17
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,747
but I had an absolute peach of a Sunday.

18
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,751
-Here you go. [chuckles]
-[sniffs]

19
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,249
Yeah, finally saw Big Ben.

20
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,585
Boy, I thought
I'd seen the biggest clock there was.

21
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,421
When I was a kid, my folks took me

22
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,006
to the Allen-Bradley Clock Tower
up there in Milwaukee.

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,762
They ended up leaving me there
all by myself.

24
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,764
Yeah, three hours and 42 minutes.
You know how I know that?

25
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,137
You were staring at a clock?

26
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,523
I was staring at a clock.
That's exactly right. Yeah, bingo.

27
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,811
That's a little bit of a mystery puzzle.

28
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,404
You figured it out right away.
You're a sharp cookie.

29
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,478
-Ted.
-Yeah.

30
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,903
Speaking as we were mere moments ago,
about time,

31
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,692
I unfortunately don't have any.

32
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,565
I have a branding meeting, so...

33
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,532
Oh. I always feel so bad for the cows,

34
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,783
but you gotta do it
otherwise they get lost.

35
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,119
That was a branding joke.

36
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,504
If we were in Kansas right now,

37
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,250
I'd just be sitting here waiting for you
to finish laughing. Yeah.

38
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,502
I'll see ya tomorrow, okay?

39
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,455
-Okay. Counting the minutes.
-Yeah, there you are.

40
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,172
[theme music plays]

41
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,401
All right. Let's see what we got here.
I've got this fella up here, the goalie.

42
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,658
Then all these guys over here, okay?

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,410
And going over here, going over that way.

44
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,077
This son of a gun's gonna go
all the way down here.

45
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,627
Crystal Palace
kicked our booties last week.

46
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,712
And this here, is our current offense
that we are running,

47
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,876
and I think it stinks!

48
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:53,965
[blows raspberry]

49
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,339
[grunts] Get rid of it.

50
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,644
Now, you might be wondering why'd I draw
all that up there just to erase it.

51
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,853
And that is because
I believe in symbolic gestures.

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,440
-[yawning] As do I.
-Whoa!

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,110
What time did you get home last night?

54
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,572
-Didn't.
-Really? Oh.

55
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,649
Nah.

56
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,073
[Ted] Now, look, our whole offense
right now is all give-and-go.

57
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,662
Give the ball to Jamie
and everyone else can go to hell.

58
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,578
So, I am officially on the prowl
for any new ideas, you hear?

59
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,658
Oh.

60
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,616
-You got something, Nate?
-Uh, no.

61
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,999
Uh, so... [stammers]

62
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,331
No. No. God, no. Never mind, I'm sorry.

63
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,917
Come on now. You're one of us.
Let's go. Fire away. What do you got?

64
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,713
Okay, right.
Well, it's just, um... No, other pocket.

65
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,587
It's just something that I thought of.

66
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,684
Um...

67
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,136
Sorry. Jesus.

68
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,053
Not that one.

69
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,268
You know what, it's not even very good.

70
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,388
It's probably really bad.
It's embarrassing even.

71
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,475
-I just--
-Sorry, Nate.

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,400
I have a real tricky time hearing
folks that don't believe in themselves.

73
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,729
I'm gonna ask you real quick again.

74
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,944
-Do you think this idea will work?
-Yeah, I do.

75
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:53,855
Whoa!

76
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,032
-Why you screaming at us, Nate?
-Oh, God!

77
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,701
We're right here.

78
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,985
All right, come on now.
Walk us through it.

79
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,202
Okay. So, I thought if we started
the attack on the wing,

80
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,615
Jamie could run through nearside,

81
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,413
then when the defense follows,
Sam could fill his spot.

82
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,247
So, use Jamie as a decoy?

83
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,583
No. [chuckles]

84
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,166
No. Well, yeah, in--
Yeah, in this case, yes.

85
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,337
Let's give it a shot.

86
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,335
What, you're gonna use my play?

87
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,636
Yeah. I mean,
we're gonna try it on, see if it fits.

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,060
You know, it might not.

89
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,928
Then again,
it might be a very flattering silhouette,

90
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,806
and I might wear it right outta the store.

91
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,653
Makes me feel good and I start to strut.

92
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,904
I'm like, "Ooh, I like this.
I like the way this makes me feel."

93
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,271
Show him your strut, Coach.

94
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,188
Yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah.
Yep, that's how to strut.

95
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,817
Let me see you strut, Nate. Come on.

96
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,067
There you go, Nate.
Yeah, that's one way to do it.

97
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,277
There you go.

98
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,616
You look a little angry,
but that's all right.

99
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,372
That's my fault.
I forgot the pitch is right this way.

100
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,874
Come on, let's go.
Strut this way. Here we go.

101
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,116
Still strutting.

102
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,997
-I'll see you later. Yeah.
-Yeah.

103
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,507
Ted! Hey, um, have you got a minute?

104
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,678
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything okay?
-Yeah, yeah. No, it's fine, yeah.

105
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,851
-It's not fine. Everything's shit.
-Oh, no.

106
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,310
This was gonna be
the front page of The Sun today.

107
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,311
"Manager Shags Star Player's Girlfriend."

108
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,770
I think a more accurate headline would be,

109
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:15,574
"Manager Innocently Feeds Young Woman
Whose Relationship Does Not Define Her."

110
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,149
Ted, this is really bad!

111
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,324
Except I look insanely fit
in this picture.

112
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,065
Yeah, no, it's beautiful light.

113
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,736
My friend who works at the paper said
he can hold this story for one day

114
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,196
-as a favor.
-Mm-hmm.

115
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:30,536
When this shit hits,
Jamie is going to go mental.

116
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,082
There's going to be photographers
all over us.

117
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:32,995
Right, right.

118
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,963
The next picture of me
will not be this perfect.

119
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,923
I am gonna be mid-sneeze face, like--
[gasp]

120
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,800
[exhales]

121
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,723
-Guess what the headline will be.
-Gesundheit?

122
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,011
"Jamie's Tart Breaks Tartt's Heart."

123
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,432
-Did you just come up with that?
-Yeah.

124
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,644
-Everyone would read that.
-Of course they would.

125
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,015
You have no idea the power of rhyming
in this goddamn country.

126
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,152
Yeah.

127
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,858
Oh, "Lasso Makes Passo
and Creates Team Fiasco."

128
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,935
Whoa. Keeley's got bars.

129
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,025
Yeah, I'm cute as a button
and I can rhyme my ass off.

130
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,907
God, it's no wonder
they want to destroy me.

131
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,911
Yeah, yeah.

132
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,039
[stammers]

133
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,461
Sorry, it took me so long
to get up the stairs.

134
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,551
I was... stopped to talk
by about a hundred people.

135
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,959
Still nothing.

136
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,087
Get someone to run
the story about Ted and Keeley.

137
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,184
[knocking]

138
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,678
-Hey, boss.
-Ted! And Keeley. Hello.

139
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,012
Hey, I found that in the hall. Yeah.

140
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,097
So, we got ourselves a situation here.

141
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,733
Go ahead, show her the picture, yeah.

142
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,403
See? And the fucking Sun
is running it tomorrow.

143
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,690
Honestly, these people,

144
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,653
they just have no regard
for people's privacy and dignity.

145
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,324
Yeah, I'm gonna find the piece of shit
that took this and who hired them.

146
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,914
No, no. Not necessary.

147
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,369
I know the owner of the paper.
I can get this stopped with a phone call.

148
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,914
Really? Oh, my God. Thank you.

149
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,246
See, what I tell ya, huh?

150
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:57,211
This woman right here is strong,
confident and powerful.

151
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,212
Boss, I tell ya, I'd hate to see you
and Michelle Obama arm wrestle,

152
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,255
but I wouldn't be able to
take my eyes off it either.

153
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,089
Oh. That's not a compliment
I've had before.

154
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,008
-You do have perfect action figure-y arms.
-Yeah.

155
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,140
There's another one. Anyway, glad to help.

156
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,103
-All right. Yeah.
-Thank you.

157
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,353
-Okay.
-[Ted] See y'all later.

158
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,019
[door closes]

159
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,064
There's no way she can
trace that photo back to me, can she?

160
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,395
-[winces] Yes.
-What do you mean "yes"?

161
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,192
Did you not use an alias
or a burner phone?

162
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:29,578
I'm not a spy, Rebecca. I'm just
the director of football operations.

163
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,738
And equally proficient at both.

164
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,537
Well, thank you. Wait...

165
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,708
Okay, here we go. Sam lays it for Dickson.

166
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,672
Okay, nice touch.

167
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,877
[Coach Beard] Switch to Bumbercatch.

168
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,549
Jamie decoys through.

169
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,763
-Sam wide open.
-[Ted] There it is!

170
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,104
[players cheering]

171
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,930
Whoo!

172
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,185
Nice play, Nate. How you feel?

173
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,520
I just don't know.
So many new feelings. Yeah.

174
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,027
Kinda like getting your first pube, right?

175
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,478
-Yeah. What?
-Here we go. [blows whistle]

176
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,948
All right. Hey. Nice work.

177
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,029
Okay, now, gentlemen,

178
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,623
here's the other thing
we're gonna start focusing on.

179
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,908
Making quicker transitions
from offense to defense.

180
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,122
Y'all gotta start making your hellos
goodbyes. You understand?

181
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,254
Easiest way to get that done well
is to do it well.

182
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,081
But aside from that,
you gotta be in great shape, right?

183
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,127
So, we are all gonna run two laps
around this field.

184
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:26,552
Anyone who loses to me
has to run four more. Let's go!

185
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,052
-Okay, come on. What you got?
-[player] What's going on?

186
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,965
[players shouting]

187
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,064
[chuckles]

188
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,059
[Ted] You're catching up.
Don't cut that corner!

189
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,100
Come on. You can't catch me,
I'm the gingerbread man.

190
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,524
[Jamie] Faster, boys!

191
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,570
-Look at his face.
-Colin, Isaac, please stop.

192
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,652
Yeah, it really hurts now.
It really hurts.

193
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,954
Be careful, Colin, now.
That's our new coach.

194
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,698
-[Colin] Oh, right, boyo.
-[Isaac] Yeah.

195
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,950
Sorry, gaffer.

196
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,534
-Thank you.
-[laughs]

197
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,831
-[chattering]
-[Ted] Whoo!

198
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,252
Okay, way to run out there today, fellas.

199
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,211
You guys are much faster than me.

200
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,881
-[camera clicks]
-Except Coach Beard.

201
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,170
What's going on? I thought you ran track
in high school or something.

202
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,264
-Chess team, Coach.
-Mm-hmm.

203
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,508
Illinois State Champs, baby.

204
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,379
Okay, yeah. Illinois is a state, fellas.

205
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,296
Uh, one last thing, there are some gifts
up in y'all's lockers.

206
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,806
In your little cubbies up there.
So, hope you enjoy 'em.

207
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,899
It's a fucking book.

208
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,711
Nice one, bitch boy.

209
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,383
[knocking]

210
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,258
-Hey.
-Yeah, I just thought you should know

211
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,930
that your boy Nathan's being harassed
every single day

212
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,010
by Jamie and his little... side-pricks.

213
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,352
-Right.
-So you know already?

214
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,472
Yep.

215
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,138
So, you'll take care of it?

216
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,306
No.

217
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,767
What the fuck?

218
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,815
Roy, I learned two pretty big lessons

219
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,820
on the rough-and-tumble playgrounds
of Brookridge Elementary School.

220
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,486
One, if little Ronnie Fowch
offers you a candy bar,

221
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,083
you immediately say no,
and you get the hell outta there.

222
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:18,909
'Cause there's a good chance

223
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:22,124
that little son of a gun has just pooped
inside of a Butterfinger wrapper.

224
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,211
No one ever saw him do it,
but a couple people ate it.

225
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,422
Number two, if the teacher tells the bully
not to pick on someone,

226
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,844
it's just gonna make it worse.

227
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,382
So, you're not gonna do anything?

228
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,336
No.

229
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,425
[scoffs]

230
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,433
Why you winding him up?

231
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,181
He's the one, Coach.

232
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,307
If we're gonna make an impact here,

233
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,654
the first domino that needs to fall
is right inside that man's heart.

234
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,616
Yes.

235
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:03,745
-Jamie, can I ask you something?
-It's 40 kilos. I do three sets of ten.

236
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,791
And then I alternate between bis...
[grunts] and tris.

237
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,457
I don't give a shit what you lift,
you little pretty boy.

238
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,217
Yeah, you do, 'cause you asked.

239
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,546
Can you curl 40 kilos?

240
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,514
No, but I can use your balls
as a speed bag.

241
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,724
-Do you wanna try that?
-Not especially.

242
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,560
Do you even understand
the influence you have on this team?

243
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,481
-I'm the shit, yeah.
-No, you're a bellend.

244
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,060
But because your right foot
was kissed by God the boys look up to you.

245
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,686
It's made me question my own faith.

246
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,480
So, when they pick on Nate...

247
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,067
[chuckles]

248
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,281
...and you laugh...

249
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Yeah.

250
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,454
...they think it's okay.

251
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,291
Right, 'cause Nate's a weak baby
and he can't do anything about it.

252
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,372
[chuckling]

253
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,748
Yeah, all right. I'll take care of it.
Nate's a good lad.

254
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,248
Good.

255
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,920
Hey, Roy. You comin' to the club tonight?

256
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,205
Hold on, will you be there?

257
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,378
-Of course, bruv.
-Then fuck no.

258
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,506
Colin, Isaac, come here.

259
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,854
You know how you two are
always messing with Nate?

260
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,101
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

261
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,269
Keep it up. Makes me laugh.

262
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,195
[clears throat]

263
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,359
-Good morning, Higgins.
-Oh, good morning. I was just--

264
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,908
Waiting at the entrance
so I'd see you were here on time.

265
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,242
Exactly. You seem in good spirits.

266
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,908
Yes, I am. I've just realized something.

267
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,917
Who cares if we can't run that picture?

268
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,879
The bigger issue
is that the local community

269
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,419
is getting behind the team
no matter how badly they play.

270
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:34,464
Mm.

271
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,376
It is an outstanding fan base.

272
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,005
Yes, one I believe I can put an end to.

273
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,802
Hooray. [chuckles]

274
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,096
[Rebecca] No.

275
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,139
Okay. I'll go back there.

276
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,273
-[Ted] Here you go.
-[Rebecca] Thank you.

277
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,560
So, I spoke to the owner of The Sun.

278
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:49,854
You spoke to God?

279
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,859
-No, the newspaper.
-Oh, right.

280
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:55,529
And he has agreed to
not run the photo of you and Keeley.

281
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:00,161
-MVP! MVP! MVP!
-[chuckles]

282
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,409
-Left leg! Whoo! Right leg, not as good!
-Okay.

283
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,081
-Yeah!
-Yes. Okay, thank you, Ted.

284
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,829
Sorry. Yeah, no.
You were saying. Go ahead.

285
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:06,911
In exchange,

286
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,365
I've agreed for his
more reputable newspaper, The Independent,

287
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,957
to do a profile on you.

288
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,342
"One-on-One with Coach Lasso."

289
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,498
Yeah, okay.

290
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,126
-The writer will be Trent Crimm.
-Hmm.

291
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:20,224
And he's very good,
and the supporters really listen to him.

292
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,680
Oh, no. I know Trent, yeah.
He's a tough cookie.

293
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,971
-Really?
-Yeah, but that's okay.

294
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,555
You know what you do
with tough cookies, don't ya?

295
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,020
-No.
-Dip 'em in milk. [chuckles]

296
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,311
[chuckles]

297
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,104
[Ted] All right, let's run that new one.

298
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,897
[players chattering]

299
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,823
Hey, there he is.

300
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,861
Hello, Coach Ted Lasso from America.

301
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,275
Hello, Trent Crimm from The Independent.

302
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,324
Hey, excited to spend the day with ya.
Gonna be fun.

303
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,778
And please, call me Ted.

304
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,035
All right, let's go!

305
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,874
[players shouting]

306
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:54,956
[Ted] Wide open.

307
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,883
-[player] Yeah!
-[Ted] Ooh! Snuck it by him.

308
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,841
-[players cheering]
-[blows whistle]

309
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,968
Thataway, Sammy. How'd that feel?

310
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,683
Oh, wonderful, Coach.
I felt that one in my penis.

311
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,644
Yeah. No, that sounds about right.
That's good. Yeah.

312
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,225
Hey, Jamie, you gotta sell
that run-through hard, baby.

313
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,981
Make the defense believe you.
Watch, like this.

314
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,612
Ball! Ball! Give me the ball!

315
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,529
I want the ball! Give me the ball!
I would like the ball, please!

316
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:19,609
Make it a performance.

317
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,953
I want you winning an Oscar
at the ESPYs next year.

318
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,359
You want me to run decoy?

319
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,407
Yeah, that's right.

320
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,449
It's a joke.

321
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,449
Unfortunately for you, though,
no one thinks it's funny.

322
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,535
That true?

323
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,160
Um, agree to disagree.
I find it hilarious.

324
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,537
I thought it was
funnier than Step Brothers.

325
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:34,504
Ooh. High praise.

326
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,790
That scene where the bunk bed collapses...

327
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,461
I used to think
that was the funniest thing I'd ever seen,

328
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,546
but then I just saw that.

329
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,631
And now I'm gonna have to
rethink my order of what I think is

330
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,836
the funniest thing I've ever seen.

331
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:47,216
Yeah, that's when sports and art combine,
as far as I'm concerned.

332
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,104
All right, fellas,
let's run it again. Let's go.

333
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,181
Cheers.

334
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,185
Yeah, they're getting it.
They're getting it.

335
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,398
Interesting play, Ted.
Did you come up with this?

336
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,479
Oh, no, no, no.

337
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,733
This is all cooked up
by our very own Nate the Great.

338
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,478
Who's "Nate the Great"?

339
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,443
Oh, yeah. There he is.

340
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,783
Someone's been walking their dog here.
Found another poo.

341
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,323
Okay.

342
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,986
What exactly does "Nate the Great" do?

343
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,914
I'm not exactly sure what his title is.

344
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,575
Hey, Coach.
What is Nate's job around here?

345
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,424
-Kit man.
-There you go. Kit man.

346
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,462
Do you mean to tell me you're
entrusting a Premier League team's attack

347
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:20,495
to the kit man?

348
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,127
That young fellow's forgotten more
about this sport than I'll ever know.

349
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,335
[chuckles] Heck, might be a genius.

350
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,675
Anything to add, Coach?

351
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Good kid.

352
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,346
Boy, oh boy.

353
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,220
If you knew Coach Beard,
you'd know what a big deal that was.

354
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,557
You mean that, don't you? Whoa.

355
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,560
Well, hell.
There's your story right there.

356
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,645
Got a headline and everything.
"Man Nods Head."

357
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,861
Watch your back, Gay Talese.

358
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,991
There's a new iconic profile
about to be typed up by one Trent Crimm.

359
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,450
Tighten up those lines!

360
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,371
Let 'em know, Coach.

361
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,794
Come on.

362
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:53,995
Get a towel.

363
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,999
-[Nathan] Oh, God. No, no, no.
-[Colin] Get a towel.

364
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,041
-Let go. Please, God. Stop it. No.
-[Roy] Oi, oi!

365
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,626
What the fuck are you doing?

366
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,050
Jamie not talk to you
about leaving him alone?

367
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:08,836
Fuck's sake.

368
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,482
[wolf whistle]

369
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,108
-You look like you've forgotten something.
-Hi, Keeley.

370
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,939
I'm looking for your prick boyfriend.
You know how to pick 'em, don't ya?

371
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,815
Um, didn't your last girlfriend steal
your Rolex and sell it for drug money?

372
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:29,494
So? I don't need a phone and a watch.

373
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,872
Look, I didn't sign up
to be your boyfriend's minder, okay?

374
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,791
But the new gaffer's
trying to make me feel responsible

375
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:39,371
for fucking Nate,
whose last name I don't even know.

376
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,628
It's Barnes.

377
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,749
No. It's Shelley.

378
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:42,835
[chuckling] Yeah, I know.

379
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,210
I don't like being tricked.

380
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:48,126
Not by you and not by,
[mocking] "Howdy y'all, cowboys.

381
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:51,137
My name is Ted Lasso and I'm from Kansas."

382
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,680
[imitates gunshots]

383
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,184
Wow, you're, like,
really, really bad at impressions, man.

384
00:16:56,266 --> 00:17:01,226
I know he's trying to push my buttons,
but I cannot be manipulated.

385
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:04,323
Come on. I could push all of your buttons
right now if I wanted to.

386
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,278
-No, you couldn't, Keeley--
-I think, actually, I could.

387
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,529
-You couldn't, Keeley-- No, Keeley.
-What was that? I can't seem to hear you.

388
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,742
-Keeley, if you would listen to me--
-I'm trying to listen to you.

389
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,071
-I could tell you why--
-So tell me.

390
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,702
Is that making you mad?

391
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,618
No.

392
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,579
No.

393
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:26,088
[mocking] "I'm Roy Kent
and I get paid to play a game,

394
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,421
but I'm mad all the time."

395
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:29,757
[grunts]

396
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,224
[chuckles]

397
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,429
That's actually pretty good.

398
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,074
-Hey, Trent.
-Mm?

399
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,398
-You know who you remind me of right now?
-No. Who?

400
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,994
One of them robot vacuums.

401
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,817
Just kinda wandering around
looking for dirt.

402
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,565
-Roomba.
-That's the one.

403
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,833
-Actually, I have a question.
-Mm-hmm.

404
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,869
After your resounding loss
to Crystal Palace,

405
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:00,713
one of your players said
there was a party in the locker room.

406
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,829
Do you feel it sends the right message
having a party after a loss?

407
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,380
Well, Trent, I've never really concerned
myself too much with wins and losses.

408
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,513
Now that's a quote I'll probably use.

409
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,591
You should get going.

410
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,887
Hey, will you let Roy know
we're heading out soon?

411
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,219
-Copy.
-Thanks, Coach.

412
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:18,474
You wanna tag along?
We're gonna go speak to some schoolkids.

413
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,057
Oh, what a coincidence.

414
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,272
The day of our interview you just happen
to be visiting a local school.

415
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,733
Well, that's the funny thing
about coincidences, ain't it?

416
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,823
Sometimes they just happen.

417
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:29,904
Come on now.

418
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,569
-[knocking]
-Come in.

419
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,994
I just wanted to come and thank you again
for stopping that picture from running.

420
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,825
And I bought you a present.

421
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,419
Made me think of you.

422
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,924
It's strong and a bit prickly.

423
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,094
You know, I've decided to
not be scared of you anymore.

424
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:52,835
I didn't know you were.

425
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,885
Oh, yeah.
I was, like, fucking terrified of you.

426
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,678
My God,
Jamie would have been so pissed off

427
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,063
with reporters poking around
in our love life. [groans]

428
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,479
I don't know why I'm telling you.
You know all about that, don't you?

429
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,060
Remember when you got divorced?

430
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,692
It rings a bell.

431
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,692
Yeah, I mean, didn't it,
like, make you really mad

432
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,444
that they went after you and not Rupert?

433
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,146
'Cause he was the one that cheated
and he came across like Prince Charming.

434
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,527
It really pissed me off.

435
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,908
Well, the press are never awful to men.

436
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,621
No one ever pays a fortune for a photo
of a naked man on a yacht in Mallorca

437
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:23,914
a week after his divorce.

438
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,247
Whoa. That's like
a very specific scenario.

439
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,963
Oh, my God. That means
there's a picture of you naked on a yacht.

440
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,004
Can I see it? Is it here?

441
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:33,337
Come on. You wouldn't have said something
if you weren't dying to show someone.

442
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:34,882
Please.

443
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:36,934
[sighs]

444
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,390
It was taken from a helicopter
while I was sunbathing.

445
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,972
[gasps]

446
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,137
Holy shit, Rebecca.

447
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,055
Are those your real tits?

448
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,524
I feel like a teenage boy.
I can't stop staring at them.

449
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,355
Where did you get those?

450
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,530
My mum.

451
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,358
I can't believe
you stopped this from running.

452
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,743
I would have shown everyone.

453
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,660
Right. I-I really need to get on.

454
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,780
Oh, sorry. Yeah.

455
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,242
Thank you.

456
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:03,367
[Keeley clears throat]

457
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:05,963
Bye.

458
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:07,707
Shoes.

459
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,252
Shoes. Yes.

460
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,212
Wow, you really blew my brains out

461
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,257
with those beautiful breasts of yours,
Rebecca.

462
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,466
-[school bell rings]
-[chattering]

463
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,440
-[clears throat]
-[chattering stops]

464
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,862
When I first saw
our school football squad,

465
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,819
I didn't think that Richmond Primary
would win a single game,

466
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,784
much less the league championship.

467
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,407
[cheering]

468
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,575
[applause stops]

469
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:53,205
To celebrate, please welcome
the new manager of AFC Richmond,

470
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,795
Ed Lasso.

471
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,470
[scattered applause]

472
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,799
Thank you. I appreciate you.

473
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:01,224
All right. Hey, gang. How y'all doing?

474
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,009
-[boy] Wanker.
-Jacob.

475
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,267
[laughter]

476
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:06,846
It's all right.

477
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,814
Uh, look, I just wanted to come down

478
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,024
and congratulate y'all
on a heck of a season.

479
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,274
But hey, I know someone else
who's really excited to meet all of ya.

480
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,938
So if you please help me welcome

481
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:19,856
the captain of your AFC Richmond squad,
Roy Kent.

482
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:22,317
[cheering]

483
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,237
[chanting] Roy! Roy! Roy! Roy!

484
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,406
Right. [clears throat]

485
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:32,076
Never been much for public speaking
or school, really.

486
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,593
Always seemed like a waste of time to me.

487
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,920
-[boy sniffles]
-[girl coughs]

488
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,257
Why don't we
get out of this stuffy auditorium,

489
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,473
go out on the pitch
and have a proper fuck-about?

490
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,144
[gasping]

491
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,676
[cheering, screaming]

492
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,816
I think it's really cool you do this.

493
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,951
Only doing it
'cause my fucking niece goes here.

494
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,608
-Oh, yeah? Which one is she?
-That idiot.

495
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:07,535
Oh, boy, here she comes.

496
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,617
Can we do headers, Uncle Roy?

497
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:10,995
Yeah, all right. Come on then.

498
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,794
All right. Come on, you lot. Line up.

499
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,746
Heads. Lovely.

500
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,546
Next. Go. Perfect.

501
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,169
Next. Heads.

502
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
Next.

503
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,795
Well done. Next.

504
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,139
Ooh, ooh!

505
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,563
Next. Sweet.

506
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,056
Lovely. I liked it.

507
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,187
-Good.
-Roy, come on.

508
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,072
You hop in there, show 'em how it's done.
I'll do a couple.

509
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,439
How you doing? Ready? Come on.

510
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,025
Ooh, that's the spot. Come on.

511
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,240
Here we go, Phoebe.
Let's see what you got.

512
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:45,161
Hey, nice catch. We might have
ourselves a goalie. [grunts]

513
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,280
[groans] Boy, oh boy.
That was right in the button.

514
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,287
Aah.

515
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:49,615
Good job, Phoebe.

516
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,002
[school bell rings]

517
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,421
[Ted] Oh! Oh boy.

518
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:57,922
Sorry about the blood there.

519
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,421
There you go.

520
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:01,756
Don't use it to clone me.

521
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,050
Nice meeting you. Take care now.

522
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,760
That's the longest anyone's ever stayed
for something like this.

523
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,596
-Hey, thanks for having us.
-Cheers.

524
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,681
Thanks again.

525
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:13,193
[laughs] Roy, that was a blast.

526
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,728
And I tell you what, that niece of yours
is a real cutie patootie.

527
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,902
Enough. I've had it with your mind games
and your stupid gifts.

528
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,403
I mean, what even is A Wrinkle in Time?

529
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,106
It's a lovely novel.

530
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:27,236
It's the story of a young girl's struggle
with the burden of leadership

531
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,664
as she journeys through space.

532
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:30,618
Yeah. That's it.

533
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,794
Am I supposed to be the little girl?

534
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,421
I'd like you to be.

535
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,165
Right. None of this matters.

536
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,382
'Cause I'm just doing
what everyone in this town is doing,

537
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,382
and I'm counting down the days
until you're gone.

538
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,474
Trent, you're a colossal prick.
You always have been.

539
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,510
Phoebe, come on.

540
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,560
-Are you hungry?
-Hmm.

541
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,019
[Trent] Little tradition.

542
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,071
Let battle commence.

543
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,725
Ted Lasso?

544
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:05,198
-Hey there, Ollie.
-Leave it out. What are you doing here?

545
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,739
Well, I mean, you invited me, remember?

546
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,822
I invite every person
who's been in my car.

547
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:11,367
Oh. Hey, Ollie. This is my friend Trent.

548
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,501
-Trent, this is my buddy Ollie.
-Pleased to meet you.

549
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,789
Congrats. You both just met a cool person.

550
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,043
[laughs] Right, gentlemen.
You know what you're having?

551
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,495
Yeah. Well, you know,
whatever the chef recommends.

552
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:24,046
Uh, that would be my father-in-law.
Are you okay with a little bit of spice?

553
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,471
Have him make it for us
like we're a couple members of the family.

554
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,140
[chuckles] You're a brave man.

555
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,018
Oh, man. Mad respect.

556
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:35,268
That might not be the wisest of choices.

557
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,807
[Ollie] Here you go, boys. [exhales]

558
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,146
-Dig in.
-[Ted] Can't wait.

559
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,320
The smell's already deep inside my brain.

560
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,939
-Gonna love it.
-I appreciate it.

561
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:47,737
I can't imagine
they have good Indian food in Kansas.

562
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,371
Oh, I have no idea.
I've never had Indian food.

563
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,369
-Whoo!
-Ooh.

564
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,035
-[chuckles]
-[Trent grunts]

565
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:03,707
Wow, that-- I mean, that's hot.

566
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:06,835
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
Feel like I'm about to breathe fire.

567
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:08,756
[Trent clears throat]

568
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:09,932
I don't think I can eat that.

569
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,012
What? No, no, no. Come on now.
We gotta put a decent dent in this,

570
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,386
otherwise we're gonna embarrass Ollie
in front of his family.

571
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:19,063
-No, really, I can't.
-Come on, just dump it on my plate.

572
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:20,943
[exhales]

573
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,651
Yeah, yeah. You're good.

574
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:25,321
So, if you love Kansas so much,
why did you--

575
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:30,199
Why did you leave to coach a sport
you can barely-- you know anything about?

576
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
Was it just the money?

577
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,575
Wait, I'm supposed to be getting paid?

578
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:34,829
Are you enjoying the food?

579
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,115
Tell your father-in-law it's perfect.

580
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,084
Ha! Dad! He says it's perfect!

581
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,081
-Ted.
-Mm-hmm?

582
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,787
What you're doing is irresponsible.

583
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:46,263
This club actually means something
to this town.

584
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,879
I know that.

585
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:48,965
I do.

586
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,131
Trent, what do you love?

587
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
Is it writing?

588
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:56,219
-Yes.
-Yeah.

589
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,806
Well, good, 'cause you're darn good at it.

590
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,425
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

591
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,438
Me? I love coaching.

592
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,150
Now, I'm gonna say this again

593
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,770
just so you didn't think
it was a mistake the first time I said it.

594
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:08,028
For me,
success is not about the wins and losses.

595
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,280
It's about helping these young fellas
be the best versions of themselves

596
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,363
on and off the field.

597
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,275
And it ain't always easy, Trent,

598
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:18,036
but neither is growing up
without someone believing in you.

599
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:20,825
Let me ask you this.

600
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,544
Is my tongue still in my mouth?

601
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,035
'Cause I am about to hallucinate
from all the heat here.

602
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,047
I really should go.

603
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,545
-Deadlines and all.
-Hey, gotta do the work.

604
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,885
Hey, I'll say this though.

605
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,140
I really enjoyed getting to
spend this time with you, Trent.

606
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,465
You actually mean that, don't you?

607
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:40,892
Yeah.

608
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:42,814
Yeah.

609
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,558
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

610
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:46,936
[Ollie] You all right?

611
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,025
Normally, one dish is plenty,

612
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,780
but we know how
you Americans like to eat, innit?

613
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,365
-Let's do it, huh?
-[both chuckle]

614
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,579
Try that one.

615
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:58,292
[exhales]

616
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:01,714
Whoo!

617
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,133
-Beautiful, right?
-It's beyond beautiful. It's hot.

618
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,877
"Mrs. Which's voice was grave.

619
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,183
'What do you understand?'

620
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:15,471
'That it has to be me.

621
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:17,763
Can't be anyone else.'"

622
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,347
Fuck!

623
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,154
That's a bad word, Uncle Roy.

624
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,900
Oh, mind your own business, Phoebe.

625
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,277
Be good.

626
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:34,362
[kisses]

627
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:39,452
[sighs]

628
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:43,996
-Yes?
-I have an advance copy of the article.

629
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,632
-Read it to me.
-Title: "Wayward Ted."

630
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:52,416
"Whatever you think of Ted Lasso
as a football coach,

631
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:56,216
I assure you,
the truth is harder to swallow."

632
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:59,011
-Hey, how you doing?
-Good. How's your nose, Coach?

633
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,556
-It's fine. Thank you for asking.
-[Higgins] "And swallow you must,

634
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,060
because Ted is out there in the community

635
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:07,862
either bravely
or stupidly facing the music."

636
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:10,018
-Hey, fellas. How you doing?
-"That's for you to decide."

637
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,857
Piss off, wanker!

638
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,112
[grunts]

639
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:15,399
-Hi.
-Yeah.

640
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,027
-Stop it.
-Every time.

641
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,414
[Higgins] "And yes, he's in over his head.

642
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:23,701
He insisted twice that he didn't care
if Richmond won or lost.

643
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:28,247
But if the Lasso way is wrong,
it's hard to imagine being right."

644
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,711
Mm.

645
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,134
Why have you stopped reading?

646
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,212
[stammers]

647
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:37,177
Please do me the favor of remembering that
these aren't my words, it's Trent Crimm.

648
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,051
Keep going.

649
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:42,512
-"In a business that celebrates ego,
-[Trent] ...celebrates ego,

650
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:43,968
-Ted reins his in."
-Ted reins his in.

651
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:48,477
[Trent] His coaching style is subtle.
It never hits you over the head.

652
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:51,612
Hello, Roy.
I didn't know it was a retirement party.

653
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,730
-[Roy grunts]
-[gasps]

654
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:54,817
Shit!

655
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,569
Stop messing with Nate!

656
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:58,781
Now, I don't know
which one of you I nutted,

657
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,244
'cause I don't
see so well at night anymore,

658
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:01,374
but that goes for all of you!

659
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,999
[Trent] Slowly growing until you can
no longer ignore its presence.

660
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:08,084
Vanilla vodka.

661
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,291
Such a child.

662
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:13,799
Keeley.

663
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:14,879
Roy.

664
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:18,336
[Trent] Whether that means
allowing followers to become leaders...

665
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,005
[rumbling]

666
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:23,313
...or in a show of respect,
eating food so spicy

667
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,558
it's sure to wreak massive havoc
on his intestinal system.

668
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:27,942
Keys, keys, keys.

669
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,018
-[keys jingle]
-Okay, here we go. Oh boy. Oh boy.

670
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,773
[Trent] And though I believe that
Ted Lasso will fail here

671
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,896
and Richmond will suffer
the embarrassment of relegation,

672
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:38,857
-I won't gloat when it happens.
-[exhales]

673
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,070
Because I can't help but root for him.

674
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,333
[groans] Fuck!
