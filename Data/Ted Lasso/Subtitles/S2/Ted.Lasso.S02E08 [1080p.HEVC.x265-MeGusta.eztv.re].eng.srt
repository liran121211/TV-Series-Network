1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,720
- Hello.
- Hi, Bridget. Sorry, I'm late.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,720
You know the only thing better
than a patient being late

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,160
is one who doesn't turn up at all.

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,180
So where did we leave off?

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,270
Let's see.
I have it in my notes-- Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,940
"Ted Lasso is driving me fucking crazy."

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,360
All right. He refuses to open up.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,860
And when he gets anywhere close
to being vulnerable,

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,240
he fires off a zinger or some obscure
reference to something very specific

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,660
to a 40-year-old white man
from middle America.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,210
So he's refusing
to be vulnerable, right?

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,040
Sounds like someone I know.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,750
Oh, stop it.
Me and Coach Lasso are nothing alike.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,960
Sharon, you do the same thing.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,970
He uses humor to deflect,
you use your intelligence.

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,260
Please.

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,720
I do not harness my savantish nature
to alienate people and isolate myself.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,350
Okay, I hear that.

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,060
I doubt you'll make any headway
with Coach Lasso

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,400
until you let your guard down yourself
and meet him halfway.

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,980
You're right.

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,320
Of course, I'm right!
Now, what are you going to do?

23
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,880
- Mind your dog!
- What?

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,460
- He hates that sweater.
- Up yours!

25
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,600
Shit!

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,230
Call 999. Someone call 999.

27
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,010
Hi, guys.

28
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,100
So, I actually have a fun,
new branding opportunity for a coach.

29
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,480
It's only one public appearance.
It's decent money.

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,530
Would be really good for the club.

31
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,740
Would either one of you want
to help me out

32
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,280
by being a spokesperson for this--

33
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,080
Right. Fuck you both.

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,040
I respect that we didn't
have to say a word.

35
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,210
She gets us.

36
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,210
I'm going to be a spokesperson.

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Where's Ted?

38
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,670
- He texted. He has some emergency.
- What?

39
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,720
- I didn't ask.
- Why not?

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,140
It's his emergency.

41
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,980
If he wanted him to know,
he would have said.

42
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,980
We have an FA Cup semifinal
at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.

43
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,770
- Who's running training?
- Me.

44
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,520
- You?
- Ted asked. I don't give a shit.

45
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,690
- Shit, I got to go.
- Where you going?

46
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,440
None of your fucking business.

47
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,200
Well…
Guess that just leaves us two. I mean--

48
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,790
- You can run training.
- Thank you.

49
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,170
That will be great-- I think--
Yes, thank you. Hold on.

50
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,640
All right, man. Let's go.

51
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,970
Switch it on, boy.
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

52
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,640
Good man. All you, mate.

53
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,690
That's it, you got it,
you got it, you got it.

54
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,230
Hello, Daddy.

55
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,980
Sam…
Do you know why I'm calling?

56
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,820
No, sir.

57
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,690
I'm calling because Cerithium Oil

58
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,740
has just been ordered
to stop operating in Nigeria.

59
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,570
Wait, what? Wait, that's incredible!

60
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,790
And you were the butterfly
whose wings made this happen.

61
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,620
I'm so proud of you, my son.

62
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you, Dad.

63
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,500
I mean, look, I only did it
because you inspired me to.

64
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,380
I appreciate you saying that,
because it's absolutely true.

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
I love you.

66
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,050
I love you too. Okay, bye-bye.

67
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,510
Oi! What you doing?

68
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,140
Oh, shit.

69
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,270
- Why didn't you say anything?
- It was on my neck.

70
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah. Sorry.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
You know what, sod off.
I got this.

72
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,660
I haven't found a term I like yet

73
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,740
for when I tell people I'm taking a shit.

74
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,750
What do you use?

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,040
I need to reapply my lip liner.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,066
Men don't know what that means

77
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,130
and women understand
it requires time and focus.

78
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,810
Say fucking yes!

79
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,400
Guys, guys! Three dots!
Three dots, three dots.

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,200
Yes!

81
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,870
Yeah!

82
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,870
- Wow. Oh, my God.
- Yes!

83
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,910
Captain.

84
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Yeah, bruv?

85
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,580
I would like to ask you for a haircut.

86
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,840
What?

87
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,420
Are you sure, bruv?

88
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,970
Yes, I think I am.

89
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,640
All right. After training.

90
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,610
- Isaac, Isaac.
- Oh, shit!

91
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,490
Oh, now hold on, lady.

92
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,820
You're telling me
I could shatter every bone in my body,

93
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,370
someone could just drop me off
in front of any old hospital,

94
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,010
dumped into a garbage can or something,

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,660
and y'all patch me up
and I don't have to pay jack squat?

96
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,160
You're damn right.

97
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,056
I tell you, I love this country.
I love this town.

98
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh, did you know that Winnie the Pooh was
based on a real bear from the London Zoo?

99
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,250
Fuck me.

100
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,590
Oh, no…

101
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,800
It's worse than I imagined.

102
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,510
She can walk again!

103
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,020
It's a miracle!

104
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,020
Oh, thank God for science!

105
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,190
Hey, Doc! The doc going to be okay, Doc?

106
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes, her scan seemed fine.

107
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,270
Good. No intracranial hemorrhaging?

108
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,780
- No.
- Or subdural hematoma?

109
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,900
No. You seem to know
a lot about brain injuries.

110
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,490
Well, I watched
a lot of Grey's Anatomy in my early 30s.

111
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,210
And actually, you know,
I coached football.

112
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,870
The American kind. You know?

113
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,790
The one with all the concussions
and hullabaloo about kneeling and such.

114
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,750
Oh, well, she does have a concussion.

115
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,976
And she's had a couple stitches
in her head.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,290
So you'll need to rest
for a few days, okay?

117
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,550
Apart from that,
your husband can take you home.

118
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,970
Oh, he's not my husband.

119
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ain't no ring on these fingers.

120
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,950
- No, we're just friends.
- Colleagues.

121
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,300
- Friendly colleagues.
- I don't have a husband.

122
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,446
Yeah, but not in a sad way.

123
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,520
You know, she's just fiercely independent.

124
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,020
And I'm perfectly capable
of taking myself home.

125
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,730
- See what I mean?
- I'm sorry, Dr. Fieldstone.

126
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,126
Hospital policy states
that head trauma patients,

127
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,320
they cannot leave unattended.

128
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,966
And there ain't no policy
like a hospital policy,

129
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,780
'cause a hospital policy don't stop.

130
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,716
Let me help you out with that, sweetheart.

131
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,870
- Here you go. There you go.
- Thank you.

132
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,660
Thank you for being here, Coach Kent.

133
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,830
My sister's at the hospital.
She works in the emergency room.

134
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,476
She can't really pop out
'cause there's always someone coming in

135
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,800
with, like, a knife stuck in their eye
or a torch stuck up their--

136
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,630
Yeah, okay, I get it. She's busy.

137
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,720
Phoebe, would you mind doing some coloring
while I talk to your uncle?

138
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,390
Yes, Ms. Bowen.

139
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,270
Can I start with
a quick personal question?

140
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,440
- Phoebe's dad--
- Oh, he's a piece of shit.

141
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,230
- Is he alive?
- Sorry, yeah. He's a living piece of shit.

142
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,320
Right.

143
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,110
Well, Coach Kent, we've got a bit of
an issue with Phoebe's behavior.

144
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,290
- Let's have it.
- She's been swearing. A lot.

145
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,460
How bad is it?

146
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,880
Today she called one of her classmates
an "apathetic shitfucker."

147
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,050
- Are they?
- Oh, yes.

148
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,880
But that's not the point.

149
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,720
Do you have any idea
where she might be getting this from?

150
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,600
Me?

151
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,980
Fuck.

152
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,820
This was her fifth offense.
She got warnings, then isolation.

153
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,440
Now I'm afraid she has to go home
for the rest of the day.

154
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,780
You know the influence you have on her.

155
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,370
Use it.

156
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,830
Oi!

157
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,910
We're leaving.

158
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,130
Sorry for what I said, Ms. Bowen.

159
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,750
Thank you, Phoebe.

160
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,130
Uncle Roy, can we get ice cream?

161
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,710
Fuck no!

162
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,680
Sorry.

163
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,600
F-no!

164
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,100
Go on, scoot your boot.

165
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,940
Fucking glitter.

166
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,280
By all measures,
it's not the cruelest prank ever played,

167
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,990
but no one should ever make someone
eat a Vaseline sandwich.

168
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,790
But that's Ronnie Fouch for you.

169
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,870
Innovator.

170
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,250
How did you know I was in the hospital?

171
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,540
Oh, you left me a bunch of voice notes.
Yeah, 32 to be exact.

172
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,750
- I thought those deleted themselves.
- Yeah, well, I kept all those puppies.

173
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,856
You should listen to some of these.
They are a hoot.

174
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,680
- Please, no, thank you.
- It doesn't matter. I got them right here.

175
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,390
Ted, it's Sharon.
I can't come to the phone right now.

176
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,470
But if you want to talk my ear off
about some bullshit

177
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,190
because you're too afraid
to properly emote, leave a message.

178
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,060
Beep!

179
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,980
- I didn't mean it.
- Come on now. You meant it a little bit.

180
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,820
In concussio veritas, right?
Ain't that the saying?

181
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,070
This next one brings
Mr. Stephen Sondheim in the house

182
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,256
'cause it's you singing "Tonight"
from West Side Story,

183
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,580
but doing both the parts of
Tony and Maria at the same time,

184
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,000
which is, well, in a word, thrilling.
Here it is.

185
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,330
Tonight, tonight

186
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Feel that.

187
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,210
And you do the whole first act.
It's incredible.

188
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,000
What is the big deal?

189
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,540
Not now.

190
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,380
My guy,
Isaac's an artist with those clippers.

191
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,710
But he only gives you
one haircut per season,

192
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,170
so you try and save that
for a very special occasion.

193
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,970
I'm not using mine until I marry.

194
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,180
Or I get circumcised.

195
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,390
Quite right.

196
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,076
Bro, I can't believe you're wasting
your Isaac cut on a blind date.

197
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,810
Yeah. What if you and this babes
only got textual chemistry?

198
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,890
Guys…

199
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,020
I believe…

200
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,530
this could be
something very special.

201
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,620
So do we all just stand here--

202
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,660
Oh, my God!

203
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,500
Shut the fuck up, Jan Maas.

204
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,170
Sorry.

205
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,680
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

206
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,970
It's like Swan Lake.

207
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,550
Oh! Yeah!

208
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,660
Come in!

209
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,250
Hi.

210
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,420
What's this about?

211
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,790
I'm just in here until my office exists.

212
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,710
It's really no problem.

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,170
If I spill anything,
I'm next to everything I need to clean up.

214
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,930
This is very, very sad.

215
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,300
What can I do for you, Jamie?

216
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,446
Can I get me dad and his two mates
on the list for Wembley tickets, please?

217
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,810
Of course! Family section? VIP?

218
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,900
Put 'em in the car park for all I care.

219
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,940
Just getting him tickets
so he'll get off me back.

220
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,820
Fathers and sons.

221
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,360
So tricky.

222
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,650
They should really write songs about it.

223
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,070
- Think they do.
- Yeah, I know. I was just--

224
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,620
Anyway…

225
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,460
You… Are you close with your dad?

226
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,540
Ups and downs, like everyone.

227
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,960
It's complicated.

228
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,260
Mine's not complicated. He's just a dick.

229
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,010
Every situation,
he does exactly what a dick would do.

230
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,486
Not much you can do with that.
Know what I mean?

231
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,720
Well, I try to love my dad for who he is
and forgive him for who he isn't.

232
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,270
Look, Jamie. Whatever he may be,
he's your father, which makes him a VIP.

233
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,940
Names?

234
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,480
James Tartt.

235
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,740
His mates are Denbo Cullens and Bug.

236
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,660
- "Bug"?
- Just Bug. One G.

237
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,910
Like the animal.

238
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,920
It's his legal name. Changed it.

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because he's small like a bug?

240
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,710
No, 'cause he eats bugs for money.

241
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,210
Right.

242
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,340
Thanks for that.

243
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,510
Yeah.

244
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,590
Okay.

245
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,430
Open or closed?

246
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,550
Closed.

247
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,810
You get less questions.

248
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,390
- All right.
- Bye.

249
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,610
Thank you for the ice cream, Uncle Roy.

250
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,900
Oi!

251
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,830
You can't swear, Phoebe.

252
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,910
But you swear all the time.

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah.

254
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,540
And it didn't hold me back
'cause I'm a footballer.

255
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,090
No one cares if we swear.
It's part of the job. It's encouraged.

256
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,090
But you can't be a doctor,
or a teacher, or a--

257
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,260
Veterinarian for wild animals.

258
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,180
Or a veterinarian for wild animals.
I still don't get how that works.

259
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,076
You treat them in the woods
and no one pays you?

260
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,100
It doesn't matter.

261
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,860
The point is you can't do that
if you swear all the time.

262
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,490
Look. You and I spend
a lot of time together,

263
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,490
and I love every second.

264
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,080
I weren't trained
in how to be around a kid.

265
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,620
And sometimes…

266
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,500
I get concerned…

267
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,380
that I've been infecting you
with the worst parts of me.

268
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,680
That's not true.

269
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,260
Uncle Roy, you teach me great things.

270
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,600
I called that boy a name
because he's a bully.

271
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,600
And because of you, I stand up to bullies.

272
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,690
And referees.

273
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,240
And I can do that without swearing.

274
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,950
Yeah.

275
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,320
'Cause you are better than me.

276
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,660
I'm as good as the best you.

277
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,410
Maybe we can stop swearing together.

278
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,870
Fuck you.

279
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,290
I can't.

280
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,170
But you can.

281
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,960
Pretty please.

282
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,470
Okay, Uncle Roy.

283
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,510
Good. Now get out of here.

284
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,010
Can you come in
for one game of Princess and Dragon?

285
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,230
Can I be the dragon this time?

286
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,730
No.

287
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,020
Fine. But you better have fixed the wand.

288
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,360
All right. Tight squeeze, huh?

289
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,926
Probably a little bit easier
when this thing can fold up, I bet.

290
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,200
Thank you for walking me home.
I'm good from here.

291
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,450
Well, that's the fifth time
you've said that.

292
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,870
I'll just set this puppy down
and I'll skedaddle.

293
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,370
Yeah, there you go.

294
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,170
Good spot for it. There you go.

295
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,920
Corporate housing, huh?

296
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,800
It does not disappoint, does it?

297
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,760
It don't really do anything.
I guess that's part of the idea, ain't it?

298
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,810
What we got back here? Hey.

299
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,140
All right. Home entertainment center.

300
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,940
Well, you know what,
I'll just say that it's fine and move on.

301
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,310
It's temporary.

302
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,530
Yeah, well, you know, what isn't, right?

303
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,700
- Would you like some tea?
- Oh, hell no.

304
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,410
No, I mean no, thank you.
Sorry, just don't care for that garbage.

305
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,950
I have water and I have wine.

306
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,080
Chicken and the egg, huh? Yeah.

307
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,210
I'll take some water.
That'd be great. Thanks.

308
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Tap okay?

309
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,210
Oh, yeah. No, I like my water
like Kyrie Irving likes his Earth. Flat.

310
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,930
So, you gonna get a new bike,
or you wanna lay off riding for a bit?

311
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,890
I don't know. I haven't thought about it.

312
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,390
Well, I hope you get back on that horse.
And by horse, I mean bicycle.

313
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,560
Although how cool would it be
if you started riding a horse to work?

314
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,546
Everybody starts calling you
"Dr. Sharon Horsewoman" or--

315
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,860
You know, becomes your hook.

316
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,740
I really should get some rest.

317
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,910
Hey, 10-4, good buddy. Good colleague.

318
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,300
Delicious as always.

319
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,560
Yeah, all right, no,
I'll let you go here, and--

320
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,770
You just give me a holler
if you need anything.

321
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,690
You know, you had quite the scare today.

322
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,360
And my job is teaching people
how to overcome what happened to me.

323
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,770
I'm fine, thank you.

324
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,070
Goodbye, Coach Lasso.

325
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,660
Yeah, all right now, Doc. Take care.

326
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,890
Jesus! Hello.

327
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,970
Why are you picking up right now?

328
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,696
You were supposed to be in there
five minutes ago.

329
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,600
Right. I can't go in.

330
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,400
Oh, come on.
You've got this. Get in there.

331
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,570
Either it's gonna be
the most amazing night

332
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,940
or it's gonna be so shit

333
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,780
that you can punish me for it
for the rest of our friendship.

334
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,780
I do like the sound of that.

335
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,070
I'm gonna hang up
'cause you're gonna go, yeah?

336
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,910
You look so beautiful I can't bear it.

337
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,840
Ms. Welton. Rebecca.

338
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,390
Sam!

339
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,760
- Hi. Hello.
- Well, that's a coincidence.

340
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,270
What's-- What's wrong?

341
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,480
What? Oh, God. Yeah, I'm fi-- I'm just--

342
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,690
I'm just a little bit nervous
'cause I'm meeting someone.

343
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,150
Okay, well, I--

344
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:43,200
Don't be nervous,
'cause you look stunning as always.

345
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,070
Thank you, Sam.

346
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,490
Oh, God, don't let me
get in the way of--

347
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,040
- You have a lovely evening.
- Yes. Thank you. You too.

348
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,160
Great haircut.

349
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,920
- Oh. Well, thank you.
- Yes.

350
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,420
That's just weird.

351
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,440
Keeley says hi.

352
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,310
Oh… tell her I say hello.

353
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,630
Oh, shit!

354
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,840
- What?
- Shit.

355
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
- What?
- Shit.

356
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,260
- What? What? What?
- Shit. God, this can't be happening!

357
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,260
- But it is. It's--
- I knew I shouldn't have come in here.

358
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,850
- But you did. You d--
- No. Sam.

359
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,850
We can't-- I'm your boss.

360
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,600
No. No. You are way too young.
I mean, you're what, like, 24?

361
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,190
- I'm-- I'm 21.
- Oh, my God. I'm a pedophile.

362
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,320
I feel-- I've groomed you.
All these messages. I was grooming you!

363
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,030
You didn't groom me, okay?
We didn't know who we were.

364
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,530
Okay, but-- but now we do,
and this is not happening.

365
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,000
No, this can't happen.
And this never happened, okay?

366
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,830
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

367
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,420
We-- We can-- We can still have--

368
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,300
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Hello. Hi. Sorry.

369
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:30,430
Listen, we can still have dinner. Okay?
It doesn't have to be a date.

370
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,640
We-- It can just be a funny coincidence

371
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,980
that we both happened to turn up
to the same fabulous restaurant,

372
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,270
both of us alone…

373
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,730
and hungry.

374
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,900
That can happen.

375
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Right?

376
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,330
I mean, I am quite hungry.

377
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,490
…to Lust Conquers All Stars.

378
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,620
Our winning couples from previous seasons
will put their love to the test.

379
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,880
Will it be
last season's winners Ellie and Danthony,

380
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,170
or season one's winners…

381
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,750
Hello, Coach Lasso.

382
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,050
Hey, Doc. So tonight I'm just gonna
keep checking in on you every 20 minutes.

383
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,840
It's standard concussion protocol,

384
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,220
but I'm gonna change my voice
every time I call you

385
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,720
so it stays exciting for you.

386
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,720
Have you been feeling dizzy or nauseous?

387
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,270
That's what it sounds like when you laugh.

388
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,190
I'm fine, Coach Lasso.

389
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,190
Then I'll talk to you in twenty minutes.
Sling Blade.

390
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,570
Hey, Ted…

391
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,950
Yes.

392
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,120
I was scared today. Really scared.

393
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,160
I love riding my bike.
It's my happy place.

394
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:27,090
And after today, I was worried
I'll be too scared to enjoy riding again.

395
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,590
I would say
that fear's a lot like underwear.

396
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,220
No, I don't want to discuss it.
I don't need a pep talk.

397
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,560
Ted, I just wanted to tell you
how I was feeling.

398
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,060
Well, I appreciate it. Means a lot.

399
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,140
And I'm glad I did it.

400
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,900
Good luck this weekend.

401
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,650
Okay, A-C-M,

402
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,320
I don't know who you are,
but I am coming after your A-S-S.

403
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,410
Let's go.

404
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,490
All right.

405
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,160
Oh, God. It's a bottomless pit.

406
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,750
I commend you.

407
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,000
Usually women use
those small handheld purses on dates.

408
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,670
- What do they call it?
- A clutch.

409
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,170
Clutch.

410
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,800
No, I'd rather dig for dinosaur bones

411
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,510
rather than have one of those bags
you can't fit your phone in.

412
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,260
- There you go.
- And this was not a date.

413
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,180
I know.

414
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,810
So…

415
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,390
can we not do this again sometime?

416
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,770
I'm going in alone.

417
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,450
Okay.

418
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,460
No, no. Nev-- never again, Sam.

419
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,710
I mean it.

420
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,010
I have to mean it.

421
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,390
Yeah, yeah, of course. You're right.

422
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,470
- Besides, we have a big game on Sunday.
- Right.

423
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,430
We both need our rest.

424
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,730
Yep.

425
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,770
Good.

426
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,610
- Good night.
- Thank you.

427
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Oh, bloody hell.

428
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,120
Bloody hell.

429
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,500
Gentlemen. Focus up.

430
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,500
All right, fellas,
I want you to close your eyes.

431
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,420
Look around.

432
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,680
You know.
I mean, open them up and take it all in.

433
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:25,640
But remember, this right behind me,
just a regular old football pitch.

434
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,310
You take away the stadium
and all the stands,

435
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,020
I think you'll find it's the same size
as our pitch back home on Nelson Road.

436
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,030
- Not exactly.
- What's that?

437
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,820
It's 500 square yards bigger.

438
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,320
- Really? The pitches aren't the same size?
- No.

439
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,200
- This is the biggest pitch in the country.
- Huge advantage for City.

440
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,620
Boy, oh, boy. This sport has
the loosiest-goosiest rules of all.

441
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,266
Tough to get my head around sometimes.
Okay.

442
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,540
All right. It's bigger.

443
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,040
And, look, I know y'all grew up
watching games on this field,

444
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,000
so you're probably a little nervous.

445
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,670
Shoot, I know I got goose bumps.

446
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,606
I remember being a little kid,
sitting in front of the television

447
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,640
and watching Queen perform
right over there during Live Aid.

448
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,600
- No, you didn't.
- That was old Wembley.

449
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,390
That field was even bigger.

450
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,480
It doesn't matter.

451
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,060
Point is, guys, we're here now, okay?

452
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,150
At this Wembley.

453
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,650
The one that Freddie Mercury
never stepped foot in.

454
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,110
And this is our day to make history.

455
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,240
And I believe we're gonna do just that.

456
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,910
Go ahead, take one more glance,
then let's head back in.

457
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,990
We got work to do.

458
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,760
Richmond!

459
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,700
City! City!

460
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,950
- City!
- City!

461
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,740
Yes! Come on!

462
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,950
Look at this. Not bad, is it?

463
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,330
Well, well, well.
Hey, these are bang tidy seats these, man.

464
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,460
That's what you get
when your son's playing in the semifinals.

465
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,470
It's not for the right fucking team,
but what can you do, eh?

466
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,510
Here you are. Get on that, kiddo.

467
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,310
We win this match,
we get Richmond tattoos.

468
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,390
Already got one.

469
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,640
- Where?
- Mind your fucking business.

470
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,810
I'm just not sure how this can…

471
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,666
What about if they have
the game of their lives?

472
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,480
Oh, yeah. I was hoping for that.

473
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,070
You good, Coach?

474
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,990
Oh, yeah.

475
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,210
I'm just doing some breathing exercises
that Doc taught me, that's all.

476
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,670
Hope it's not stomach problems again.

477
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,960
Tell me you didn't eat the prawn cocktail.

478
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,050
No, never.

479
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,260
Guys, it's time.

480
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,090
Here we go. Come on.

481
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,600
Hey, fellas, hold on a sec.

482
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,980
I need to tell you all something.

483
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,866
When I left the match against Tottenham,

484
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,610
it-- it wasn't 'cause, you know,
my stomach was bothering me.

485
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,150
It was 'cause I had a panic attack.

486
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,410
I've been having them
from time to time as of late,

487
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,490
and I'm working on it.

488
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
But I just want you all to know the truth.

489
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
We good?

490
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,340
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. Of course.

491
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,670
Okay. Okay, all right.
All right, let's go get 'em.

492
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,590
- Richmond on three.
- Wait!

493
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,050
I need to confess something too.

494
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,560
I messed up the time zones
on our transfer deadline,

495
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,230
which is why we didn't sign up
that amazing fullback from Brazil.

496
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,360
Oh, my God.

497
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,730
- That's okay.
- Okay.

498
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,110
- Yeah, okay.
- All good.

499
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,740
- Okay.
- That's all right. Yeah.

500
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,240
Okay. Here we go.

501
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,160
I don't read the scouting reports
you guys write.

502
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,870
I've lied every time they've come up.

503
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,870
They're boring, and I won't do it.

504
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,420
I appreciate that.

505
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,130
I pretend to get ideas in the moment,

506
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,100
but they're just good ideas
I've had for months.

507
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,890
I just time them to look spontaneous.

508
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,260
It's a good move.

509
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,510
Illusion of the first time.

510
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,320
There was one game this season
where I was accidentally on mushrooms.

511
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,480
"Accidentally"?

512
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,110
I'd been at Jane's house,
and I drank tea from the wrong pot.

513
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,730
The Port Vale match?

514
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,940
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

515
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,860
It won't happen again.

516
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,570
Thanks, guys.

517
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,290
Thank you.

518
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,556
- All right, let's go kick their butts.
- Butts on three.

519
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,580
- Works for me. One, two, three.
- Butts!

520
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,340
You all fancy now, drinking tea, huh?

521
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,010
I didn't know how to tell you.

522
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,350
Wembley Stadium,
the Taj Mahal of English football.

523
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,850
The setting
for every young footballer's dreams.

524
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:22,900
A sporting battlefield,
pockmarked with the footprints of giants.

525
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,360
Hoping to add another upset
to this fabled ground's storied list,

526
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,360
humble AFC Richmond.

527
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,610
Never won a major trophy.

528
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,280
The last London club
to make their Wembley debut.

529
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,160
Renewing hostilities against
the undisputed greatest team in the land,

530
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,330
the mighty Manchester City.

531
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,920
It was only 11 months ago

532
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,590
this Richmond side were relegated by City
in heartbreaking fashion.

533
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,930
Jamie Tartt was a City player then,
and he helped send Richmond down.

534
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,850
Then City sent him down the M40,
and he's a Greyhound again.

535
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,480
Come on! Come on!

536
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,980
City are after another trophy.
Richmond are after revenge.

537
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:11,900
It's ready to blow,
it's under the arch, it's Wembley Stadium.

538
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,030
It's the FA Cup semifinal,
and it starts now.

539
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,920
- Goal Manchester City!
- Fuck!

540
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,050
No!

541
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,880
- How's that not offside?
- 'Cause he was only passively offside.

542
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,380
I don't get this frigging rule still.
That's all right.

543
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,760
- We're okay, guys!
- It's a corner kick for City.

544
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,510
And a goal!

545
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,680
- Fuck!
- It's 2-nil.

546
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,180
Oh, 2-nil!

547
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,480
Shit!

548
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,916
This free kick could be dangerous.

549
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,690
And it is. It's 3-nil.

550
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,940
They'll be searching for solutions
on the Richmond bench.

551
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,030
Defend!

552
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,966
- We've got to go three attackers--
- No. It's never too late to park the bus.

553
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,030
- It is too late.
- Guys, one at a time, please.

554
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,370
Okay, don't worry about it.
Hey, it's okay.

555
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,410
Can Richmond turn it around
in the second half?

556
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,580
Oh, no. It's an own goal. And it's 4-nil.

557
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,050
Come on, boys!
You can do better than this!

558
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,380
This is when you start looking
for someone to blame.

559
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,300
Hey, ref! Clean the shit out of your eyes,
you dickless wonder.

560
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,930
Oh, no. Never mess with Mike Dean.

561
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,350
Can't say that, mate. I'm sorry.

562
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,680
There you go.

563
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,890
Sorry about that, Mike.
We all know you have a penis.

564
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,020
I've been called worse.

565
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,440
All right, here we go! We got it!

566
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,530
And it's a penalty.

567
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,780
- Referee!
- What was it?

568
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,240
What is that?

569
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,500
And City remove any shred of doubt
to the outcome of this match.

570
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,000
If this was a fight,
they would stop it.

571
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,300
Frankly, Arlo, all fights should be
stopped before they even start.

572
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,550
God fucking damn it.

573
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,420
Come on now, Coach. It is what it is.

574
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,260
Yeah. It is what it is.

575
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,350
Hey, Jamie!
You can score one now.

576
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,600
Fill your boots! Go on!

577
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,780
The only nice thing I can say
about Richmond today

578
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,580
is that Sam Obisanya's hair
looks absolutely fantastic.

579
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,790
City move on
to play Leicester in the final.

580
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,620
And you can be sure
Richmond's disappointment

581
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:32,380
hangs heaviest on the head of
a devastated Jamie Tartt.

582
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,670
It's on me arse.

583
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,180
All right. Okay. So…

584
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,970
So, Sam, how did it feel
to lose that badly out there today?

585
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Well, it's tough.

586
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,150
It's tough.
I feel sorry that we let the fans down.

587
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,460
There's nothing you can say.
It is what it is. It's a write-off.

588
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,870
We start again tomorrow.

589
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,130
Mr. Tartt.

590
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,630
You have a visitor.

591
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,130
Says he's your father.

592
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Yeah.

593
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,010
Are you decent?

594
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,520
I told ya. Dick.

595
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,650
Oh, gentlemen! Gentlemen!

596
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:37,110
Hey, it's a tough one, lads.
It's a tough one, but no shame to it,

597
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,110
'cause, you know,
we only ever beat everybody we play.

598
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,240
So you pups had no chance.

599
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,910
And there he is, my son.

600
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,660
My own flesh and blood.

601
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,580
Poor Jamie, my son.

602
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,170
Now, maybe I'm thinking
his heart's still in Manchester

603
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,590
and that's why he missed that sitter
in the first half.

604
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,930
You absolutely balled it. You balled it.

605
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,770
What were you thinking?
I'm only kidding, hey.

606
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:15,230
Hey, look, do us a favor
and get Denbo and Bug past security.

607
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,690
They wanna go on the pitch,
take a few snaps, yeah?

608
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
I'd rather 'em not.

609
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,650
Yeah, they just want to look around.
It'll only take a second.

610
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,320
I'd rather 'em not.

611
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,660
What?

612
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,410
What, you're not gonna all go
little moody bitch

613
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,596
just 'cause you got your arse
served to you on a plate, are ya?

614
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,330
Don't speak to me like that.

615
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,040
Don't speak to me like that.

616
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,710
Don't speak to me like that.

617
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,130
Okay, well, let's see
if you can hear this.

618
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,680
You know that ickle TV show you made?

619
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,260
You made it easier for Manchester City
to kick you to the curb.

620
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,680
And look where you are now.

621
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,350
Twaddling about with a bunch of amateurs.
No offense, no offense.

622
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,610
Don't turn your back on me,
you pussy.

623
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,870
Jesus. God.

624
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,540
Oh, yeah. Okay.

625
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,000
You can have that one for free.

626
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,040
- Time to go.
- You wanna go? Let's have it.

627
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,630
- Don't you forget where you came from.
- Watch the door.

628
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Oops.

629
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,950
Hello, Coach Lasso.

630
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,830
Sorry about the loss.

631
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,630
Oh, and thank you for the new bicycle.

632
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,880
It's very kind, but unnecessary.

633
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,590
Coach Lasso?

634
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,260
My father killed himself when I was 16.

635
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,770
That happened to me and to my mom.

636
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,940
I'm so sorry, Ted.

637
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:09,450
And look, I don't know if that's where
maybe some of my issues stem from.

638
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,530
No, it definitely is.

639
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,030
Right. That makes sense.

640
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,750
Do you want to talk about it now?

641
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,790
No. No, not right now.
I need to get back inside to the team.

642
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,090
I just wanted you to know.

643
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,050
Okay, thank you for telling me, Ted.

644
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,340
Please call if you need me.

645
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,430
I will.

646
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,970
I will, I'm sorry. I will.

647
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,480
It's okay. Good night, Ted.

648
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,530
Hey, Coach!

649
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,410
Yeah?

650
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,330
You good?

651
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah, no--
I just had a quick phone call.

652
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,040
- That was a rough night, huh?
- Yeah.

653
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,340
Okay, what do you--

654
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,460
What do you say
we make like Schreiber and Liev, huh?

655
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,550
About that…

656
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,050
I don't want to ride back with you guys.
I'd rather go shake this off.

657
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,180
Yeah, sure, no. Of course.

658
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,270
You wanna join me?

659
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,480
Well, you know I promised Henry
I'd FaceTime him.

660
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,400
They had a recital at his school,
and I wanna hear how it went.

661
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,110
I'll take a rain check.
All right? Yeah.

662
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:34,070
Hey. Hey, hey,
just be careful out there, all right?

663
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,330
- Yeah.
- Okay.

664
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,740
And don't forget tomorrow.

665
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,460
It's your turn
for coffee at the game film.

666
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,670
- Yeah.
- Bright and early.

667
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,050
Hey, Coach, bird by bird.

668
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,590
Not that kind of bird, but…

669
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,800
Earlier,
Manchester City routed AFC Richmond

670
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,510
in the FA Cup 5-nil
with a parade of fantastic goals.

671
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,980
And Goliath
has put David back in his place.

672
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,400
Here's Sam Obisanya postgame.

673
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,650
Well-- well, it's-- it's tough.
It's tough…

674
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,490
I feel sorry that we let the fans down.

675
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,200
We lost. Very badly.

676
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,240
But we tried.

677
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,410
We gave it everything we had,

678
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:07,790
and for me, that is okay
because what's worse is not to try at all.

679
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,920
To try is scary, you know,
because you can end up losing a lot.

680
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,840
But you have to put your heart out there.

681
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,760
Otherwise, what's the point?

682
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,100
Thank you.

683
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,100
Yeah.

684
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,830
Why did you send me your address?

685
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,490
For next time.
