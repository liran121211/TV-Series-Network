1
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:07,007
I don't wanna ride back with you guys.
Rather go shake this off.

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,343
Yeah, sure. No, of course.

3
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:13,555
Hey. Hey, hey.
Just-- Be careful out there, all right?

4
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,392
Yeah? Okay. And don't forget,

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:22,064
tomorrow it's your turn for coffee
at the game film, all right?

6
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,357
-Yeah.
-Bright and early.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,946
Hey, Coach. Bird by bird.

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,323
Not that kind of bird.

9
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:43,627
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone

10
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,799
Without a dream in my heart

11
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,010
Without a love of my own

12
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:59,184
Mind the gap.

13
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,272
This is the southbound
metropolitan line train to Aldgate.

14
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,195
Doors closing.
Stand clear of the doors, please.

15
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,492
It was moment after moment like this.

16
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,702
A real David versus Goliath match,

17
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,665
but where Goliath just curb-stomped David
in the back of the skull

18
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,416
like in that Ed Norton movie.

19
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,960
Moonrise Kingdom?

20
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,545
I think that's it, yeah.

21
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,048
Yeah. Well, for me,
the match was a real Cinderella story.

22
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,010
If her glass slipper broke
and sliced her Achilles tendon.

23
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,638
Thierry, was this just
an off day for the players?

24
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,557
Or do we lay the blame
on the coaching staff?

25
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,725
100% coaching staff.

26
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,435
Those are good footballers.

27
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,480
It just felt like Richmond had no plan.

28
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:12,067
-And what about Coach Beard?
-What about him, indeed.

29
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,070
Coach Beard knew an aggressive
offensive strategy was a mistake.

30
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,907
He should not have let Ted,
Nathan and Roy convince him otherwise.

31
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,411
Great point, Thierry.
Coach Beard is Ted Lasso's number two.

32
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,247
He's supposed to challenge him,
not just be a sniveling lackey.

33
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,126
Look, Gary, the man has no va-va-voom.

34
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,173
Does anything say "sad, single man"
more than a chessboard coffee table?

35
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,594
I know I'm French
and expected to say things like this,

36
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,805
but I hate Coach Beard.

37
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,100
Shut up, Thierry Henry.

38
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,519
After Richard Montlaur
earned himself a red card,

39
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,313
things went from bad to worse.

40
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,379
Ted joining you?

41
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,506
No.

42
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,091
-Jane coming?
-We broke up.

43
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,593
Shocking.

44
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,720
She accused me of being jealous. Me.

45
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,723
Because I told her
it's hard to know where I stand,

46
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,267
which it is,
because she never says "I love you."

47
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,603
-Did you say it to her?
-I did.

48
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,855
-And she didn't say it back.
-She did not.

49
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,983
Thank you for helping me relive that.

50
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,819
Well, you must feel awful.

51
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,657
Reason is powerless
in the expression of love.

52
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,326
Nuh-uh. I meant about the match.

53
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,412
What the hell was your thinking
behind those tactics?

54
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,374
-Mae.
-All right. Enjoy your beer.

55
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,546
But come on.

56
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,674
There's no way you thought coming out
on the attack was a good idea.

57
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,553
You basically left Zoreaux
back there to defend by himself.

58
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,931
In a semifinal…

59
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,059
A semifinal!

60
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,425
Oi, Beard. Dropped your keys.

61
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,385
Thanks.

62
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,971
-Rough match, mate.
-We thought you needed a hug.

63
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,725
-I thought you needed a hug.
-Do you wanna talk about it?

64
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,351
We can talk and drink

65
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,271
as long as we talk about
anything but the game and drink.

66
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,612
-Have you ever been to Vegas?
-What's Ted like behind closed doors?

67
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,780
How do you cope knowing
the universe is infinite

68
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,991
but your consciousness can end
in a second?

69
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,373
I've been to Vegas many times.

70
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,877
One night is good,
two nights is perfect, three is too many.

71
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,254
Ted is a man. Just a man.

72
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,550
And as for the fragility of life,
I'm so glad someone finally asked.

73
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,428
Because, yeah, I got a few thoughts.

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,229
And so, in conclusion,

75
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,689
if this is all indeed a simulation,

76
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,651
which everything
in my experience suggests that it is,

77
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,614
then all we can do is tip our caps
to the rascal pulling the strings.

78
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,576
That's it, people.

79
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,956
Just like my legs after a date with a guy
who kept correcting me,

80
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,040
we're closed.

81
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,917
You went on a date with Richard?

82
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,546
I think you'll find, Mae,
it was two dates.

83
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,630
Out.

84
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,007
Coffee was a date.

85
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,692
Where to next?

86
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,945
Bed. This is England, mate.
Pubs shut at 11:30.

87
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,073
Well, I'm not ready for the night to end.
Any ideas?

88
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,284
What about Bones & Honey?

89
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,743
As if.

90
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,830
Private club, very swanky,
impossible to get in.

91
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,166
Yeah, I heard they once turned away Cher.

92
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,295
Would you believe
They did such a thing?

93
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,880
Well…

94
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,010
Why don't we just head over there
and see what happens?

95
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,054
I think there's a dress code.

96
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,566
Mae, I love you!

97
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,207
Taxi!

98
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,925
-Welcome back, darling.
-Thank you.

99
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,845
Good evening.

100
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,681
Do we know each other?

101
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:38,058
I don't think we do, sir.
May I see your membership card?

102
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,313
University of Barcelona, class of 2004?

103
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,774
I went to Warwick, 2007.

104
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,817
Sorry, you looked older.

105
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,528
Are you a member here?

106
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,947
Here? No. God, no. Never.

107
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,618
Well, if you're not a member,
I'm afraid you can't come in.

108
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,495
This is Bones & Honey.

109
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,747
You are very rude.

110
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,124
What is your name?

111
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,294
My name is Sarah Coombes.
What is your name?

112
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,256
None of my business.

113
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,561
Bones & Honey, may I help you?

114
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,855
Do you mind?

115
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,607
Speak.

116
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,818
Hello, this is the fire brigade.

117
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,613
It's very important
that we get in touch with--

118
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,866
-Sarah Coombes.
-Sarah Coombes.

119
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,701
That's you.

120
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,620
Well, I'm very sorry, madam,
but your flat is on fire.

121
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,873
You need to come down here immediately.

122
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,376
-Now what?
-Act cool.

123
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,839
Orion's Belt!

124
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,676
Amazing.

125
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,597
We're walking. We're walking.

126
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,435
You did it.

127
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,979
You did what Cher couldn't do.

128
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,065
I actually feel bad for Sarah Coombes.

129
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,942
Nah. Think how excited she'll be

130
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,945
when she realizes that
her place didn't actually burn down.

131
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,740
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Sarah Coombes's life.

132
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,367
Her apartment will look
more amazing to her

133
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,536
than any place any of us have ever lived.

134
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,414
Here we go.

135
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,336
Okay, gentlemen, plan of attack.

136
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,007
What's wrong?

137
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,012
I don't think we belong here.

138
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,264
Knock that shit off.

139
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:40,933
We belong.

140
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,061
If you could be anywhere,
where would you wanna be?

141
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:45,812
Here, right?

142
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,482
Then act like it.

143
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,277
Now who wants an overpriced beer?

144
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,490
Who wants an overpriced beer
that I'm paying for?

145
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,868
Find us a spot.

146
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,663
And feel free to strut.

147
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,273
What can I get you, sir?

148
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,151
-Four beers, please.
-Would you like them in glass, sir?

149
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,528
No.

150
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,587
Relax, fella. It's just angles.

151
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,839
Maybe if you'd paid attention in trig,
you'd do better.

152
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,802
Shall we
have a friendly wager on this shot?

153
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,888
Say, 20 quid?

154
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,972
Hold on.

155
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,932
What's trig?

156
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,228
Trigonometry.

157
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,938
Maths. Yeah?

158
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,732
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

159
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,817
Sorry, but where did you guys study?

160
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:18,197
There you are, lads. Ha.
Thought I'd lost you.

161
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,241
Then where would I be?
Sad and alone.

162
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,160
Evening, gents.

163
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,329
I see you've met my protégés.

164
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,539
I'm Professor
Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus.

165
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:29,875
At your service.
I assure you, the pleasure is mine.

166
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:35,339
But, I must tell you, these lads here were
the best of the best at Oxford itself.

167
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,468
And now, we're just having
a wee liquid reunion, aren't we?

168
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,804
-Oxford?
-Yeah, what were you professor of?

169
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,349
Economics and management, till I retired.

170
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,226
At Oxford.

171
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,810
That is correct.

172
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,687
We were at Oxford.

173
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,732
Christ Church.

174
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,527
Which college were you?

175
00:12:58,737 --> 00:12:59,863
Christ Church?

176
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,241
Our main rivals.

177
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,285
I'm a Merton man, myself.

178
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:06,995
Merton.

179
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,706
Where'd you live?

180
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,750
Right across from the chapel.

181
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,963
Nothing like waking up every morning
to the sound of the Dobson Organ at 8:15,

182
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,214
am I right?

183
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,220
You Merton motherfucker.

184
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,684
How are you, sir?
When did you leave?

185
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,436
2015. The year we beat Cambridge
in the boat race

186
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,939
by six and a half lengths, lest we forget.

187
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,525
I was on that crew. I was the cox.

188
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,652
Yes, you were, you bastard.

189
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,740
Harry Gill is here!
Harry Gill, in this pub!

190
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,200
Hey!

191
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,578
Marvelous. Marvelous.

192
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,997
Professor McGonagall taught us a lot.

193
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,750
But the main thing he taught us was
the value of money.

194
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,795
£20. You're on.

195
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,928
I got it. I got it.

196
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,263
I've got five.

197
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,974
Save one for a kebab.

198
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,768
Eccentric geniuses.

199
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:12,978
Right.

200
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:17,774
17, 18, 19, 20.

201
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,526
How's that for trigonometry?

202
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,279
We got there.

203
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,170
Yes!

204
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,091
-Fair play!
-Good on you.

205
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,178
Next round is on us.

206
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,471
Anything you like.

207
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,057
-Three big boots of ale?
-This guy.

208
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,146
Oi. How'd you know
all that stuff about Oxford?

209
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:00,526
I dated a professor at Oxford.
And I listen more than I talk.

210
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,530
I'll be right back.

211
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,783
Oi.

212
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,826
What a legend you are!

213
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,585
Hard to forget a game like that.

214
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,505
You know what will help?
Going to see the woman you love.

215
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,216
Exactly. But it's clear to me

216
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,011
that Coach Beard doesn't think
he's worthy of Jane.

217
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,345
I know.

218
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,850
Beard's self-esteem is so low,
he will need a pep talk to kill himself,

219
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,686
and I would like to give that pep talk.

220
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,271
Shut up, Thierry Henry.

221
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,067
Goddamn fucking shit!

222
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,070
Is there a problem here?

223
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,282
Yeah. This nail on your faux Persian
flea market coffee table

224
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,491
just tore my pants.

225
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,660
Sir, can I see your membership card,
please?

226
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,833
My friends are in there.

227
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,337
Goddamn it.

228
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,175
I'm sure you know that
your trousers are ripped.

229
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,347
They're designed that way.

230
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,600
To make it easier
for people to kiss my ass.

231
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,438
Be careful.
We have decency laws in England.

232
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:02,648
You'll get arrested.

233
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,108
I wasn't aware
the laws were so restrictive here.

234
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,487
Oh, yeah. We're a repressed nation.

235
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,656
One exposed arse can bring down
the monarchy itself.

236
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,867
How dare you speak of
Prince Andrew that way.

237
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,204
I could fix those for you.

238
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,208
I live over there.

239
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:23,836
In that pointy building?

240
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:25,796
No.

241
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,571
Take your trousers off.

242
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,198
You're not in charge of me.

243
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,333
I'll give you something to wear
in the meantime.

244
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,679
People come and go from my life.

245
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,807
I've always kept a pair of their trousers.

246
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,769
This rack is like my memoirs.

247
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,523
These should fit.

248
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,067
Whose were these?

249
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,402
An old lover.

250
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,695
Where's he now?

251
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,821
Dead.

252
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,575
You dropped your keys.

253
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:46,168
You ever look back on a relationship
and regret it had ended?

254
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,420
Been doing it all day.

255
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,715
I've loved every man in my life,

256
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,010
but I don't think I regret a single one
of those relationships ending.

257
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:59,056
In all my happiest memories, I'm single.

258
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:02,893
That troubles me.

259
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,027
Have you ever been in love?

260
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,783
I mean, there's someone in my life now
who…

261
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,871
maybe it's chemicals
or maybe it's pheromones, but…

262
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,795
I wanna be with her all the time.

263
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,632
Is that love, or do I just have a problem?

264
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,133
Why can't it be both?

265
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:40,889
Could you get that?

266
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,144
It says, "Do not answer."

267
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,438
It's a joke.

268
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,194
Oi, babe, I'm here, but I forgot my keys.

269
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,364
Who the fuck are you?

270
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,490
I'm Beard.

271
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,618
He's just a trouserless man
I met at Bones & Honey.

272
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,953
What the fuck?

273
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,205
Oi, shithead!

274
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:08,625
I'm gonna punch
your fucking teeth out your face

275
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,503
and feed 'em to your arsehole
like they're candy.

276
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,297
Oh, shit.

277
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,258
-You could've warned me.
-Don't mind him.

278
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,759
He's just a little jealous.

279
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:22,097
Open the fucking door.
You're a dead man.

280
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:24,975
Run.

281
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,815
Where the fuck is he?

282
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,134
Nowhere to go.

283
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,765
Oi!

284
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,622
Still got it!

285
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,514
Oi, he hasn't tapped in.

286
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,436
We're not going anywhere until you tap in.

287
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,939
Of course, of course, of course.
My pleasure.

288
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,661
Excuse me, madam.

289
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:55,250
Piss off, you fucking scrounger.

290
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:18,315
Good evening, sir.

291
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,360
Are you staying with us tonight?

292
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,654
No. No, I am not.

293
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,113
Well. Have a good evening.

294
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,450
Could I please use the phone?

295
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,287
The hotel phones are just for guests,
I'm afraid, sir.

296
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:35,582
Okay then.

297
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,378
-Could I please use your phone?
-My personal phone?

298
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,464
Yes, I lost my phone and my wallet,
and I'm just trying to get back home.

299
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,550
And what would you be using
my personal phone for, sir?

300
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:46,718
Booking a cab.

301
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:49,054
Nope. I'm not falling for that.

302
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,681
I'm not trying to trick you.

303
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,558
Exactly what a trickster would say.

304
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,353
I would just go
through my own account, you know.

305
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,273
That's how it starts, isn't it?
First you book a cab.

306
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,733
Next thing I know,
you've geolinked my phone to your network

307
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:05,362
and all of a sudden, you and fake Melania
have downloaded all my bank details

308
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,197
and you're using my identity to shift

309
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,199
more poppy seeds
to your own private island.

310
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,201
No. Not tonight.

311
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,453
I've been in this game too long now.

312
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,998
-What game?
-You won't touch my phone.

313
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,041
Within seconds,
you'll have my mother's maiden name,

314
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,334
all my cryptocurrencies.

315
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,836
Not that I have any.

316
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,047
Next thing I know,
my hard drive is being confiscated by MI5

317
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,675
for illegal images
that you've tricked me into downloading.

318
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:29,094
Oh, no. You'll not make a fool of me.

319
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,930
Not you.
Not a dead ringer for Dame Judi Dench.

320
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,683
Not anyone. Shame on you, sir! Good night.

321
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:03,045
Hello.

322
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,301
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you guys.

323
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,930
Just trying to get home
and I lost my phone.

324
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,308
You guys are about to save my life.

325
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,522
Ah, shit.

326
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,691
Well, look who it isn't.

327
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:26,902
Good to see you again, Mr. Tartt.

328
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:30,364
Sorry about before. Why don't I let you
get back to what you were doing--

329
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,533
It's okay. There's no rush.

330
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,370
I tell you what, lads.

331
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:41,083
Why don't we teach Coach here,
in his magic trousers…

332
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:44,753
exactly what football's all about.

333
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,297
Because it doesn't happen on the pitch.

334
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:48,674
No.

335
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,051
It happens on the street.

336
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:53,929
You get me?

337
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,473
Or…

338
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,475
Get him!

339
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:01,812
Come on!

340
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:19,663
Well, it looks like
Beard's done for, doesn't it?

341
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:23,500
Gary, part of me thinks Beard
really wanted to get beat up tonight.

342
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,085
Absolutely, Thierry.

343
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,879
Clearly he'd rather punish himself

344
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:29,965
than accept the love and support
of the people around him.

345
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,510
I'm beginning to think
Coach Beard hates himself.

346
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:35,053
Shut up, Thierry Henry.

347
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:39,725
Yeah!

348
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,231
Huh, mate?

349
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,195
-Punch him again.
-Prick!

350
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:55,866
You're nothing!

351
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:14,885
Gotcha!

352
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:18,680
Stay down!

353
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,020
Oh, shit.

354
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:29,733
Oh, shit.

355
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:32,569
-I told you to stay--
-Fellas!

356
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,531
How about we call this a draw?

357
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:45,457
You had to push it, didn't ya?

358
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,460
Say good night, son.

359
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,607
Ah, man. Come on.

360
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:13,026
Nothing happened.
She was just gonna fix my pants.

361
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,863
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

362
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,867
You left these at our flat.

363
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,787
Been trying to find ya.

364
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,378
Well, that's nice.

365
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:36,758
No, I'm sorry I lost my temper.

366
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:38,385
Mary explained what happened.

367
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:41,680
The truth is we're having a baby.

368
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:46,268
And it's made me realize
how precious she is to me,

369
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:50,731
and the thought that she was
cheating on me was just too much.

370
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:51,815
Uh-huh.

371
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,483
But I also realize that

372
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:56,695
maybe I'm more paranoid than most
when it comes to that.

373
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,572
'Cause I used to cheat in the past.

374
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,283
But I've really worked on it.

375
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,869
-I'm in a really good place now.
-That's great.

376
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:04,953
Yeah, cheers.

377
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:08,582
Anyway, I just wanted to give you
your stuff back.

378
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,002
Mary says she's keeping
your trousers though.

379
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,796
It's kind of her thing.

380
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:16,882
She said you can keep those.

381
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,260
-Thank you.
-Well, they look good on you.

382
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,387
I know.

383
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:25,265
Sorry about the shit game today.

384
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:30,604
And I'm not even a Richmond fan,
but, mamma mia, that was tough to watch.

385
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:38,779
I think you dropped those.

386
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,157
All right.

387
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,119
You be lucky, yeah?

388
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:48,664
I'm trying.

389
00:29:55,921 --> 00:30:00,384
Oh, no.
No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

390
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:03,428
Oh, no. No, no, no.

391
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,060
I love you too. I love you too!

392
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:15,816
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! No!

393
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,607
Oi, samurai!

394
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,777
We got a limo
We got a limo

395
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,363
-Get in! Come on!
-Look, we got a limo!

396
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,575
They were really nice guys in the end.

397
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:08,202
And so bad at pool.

398
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:09,703
We told them who we really were,

399
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:12,539
and they still invited us
to their country estate for Easter.

400
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,416
I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

401
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,171
We made so much money off them,
we treated ourself to a limo!

402
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:21,965
-Where to, sir?
-Anywhere you want.

403
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:23,926
This night will never end.

404
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,385
Home, please.

405
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:34,186
Thanks for a wicked night.

406
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,730
You're gonna go to this address

407
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:40,484
and you're gonna tell Renee
that Beard said it was okay.

408
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:43,362
Thanks, guys.

409
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:49,284
Just one Cornetto

410
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,995
Give it to me

411
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,499
Delicious ice cream

412
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:59,044
Of Italy

413
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:18,939
No.

414
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:22,234
No.

415
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:29,825
No!

416
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,863
Are you there, God?

417
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:52,366
It's me, Margaret's little boy.

418
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:57,454
Longtime listener, first-time caller.
And I know you're probably busy,

419
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:01,416
'cause you got bigger fish to multiply
and then fry.

420
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,295
As you do. But there's this girl.

421
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,884
There's this woman, Jane.

422
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,763
Last name Payne. P-A-Y-N-E.

423
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:17,349
But you probably know that,
but if you wanted to look her up.

424
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,980
And I care for her, deeply.

425
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:27,067
I could've been with her tonight,
but I ended up with you.

426
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:35,449
And I am under no illusions
that she could solve what ails me.

427
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,871
But when I'm with her,
the world just feels…

428
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,625
more interesting.

429
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,362
What is this place?

430
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:17,159
Here. 2-3-7.

431
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:22,623
-Well, knock then.
-Why don't you knock?

432
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:23,707
Just knock.

433
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:28,420
What?

434
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,172
Are you Renee?

435
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:31,423
Who's asking?

436
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:34,176
Coach Beard sent us.

437
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:43,393
Turn 'em on.

438
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,022
Walk this way.

439
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:48,690
Go on.

440
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:52,736
Come on.

441
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,238
Come on.

442
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:14,424
Oh, my God.

443
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:15,759
It's beautiful.

444
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:17,052
Is that heaven?

445
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,848
No. That's Nelson Road.

446
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,402
Wave to the crowd! Wave to the crowd!

447
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,058
Yeah!

448
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:13,275
Fuck yes!

449
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:42,865
Try this on.

450
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,296
-They do food here?
-For me, yeah.

451
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:44,778
-Where the fuck is he?
-If Beard's not coming, I'll get coffees.

452
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:47,072
Wait. Now, hold on a second.
He'll be here.

453
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:48,699
Beard's like the mailman, you know?

454
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,826
He always delivers
and he looks great in shorts.

455
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:53,829
Morning, fellas.

456
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:56,206
-What'd I tell you?
-Here you go.

457
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,043
Flat white. Coffee, black.
Peppermint latte.

458
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:02,004
Cheers.

459
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,339
Thank you, Coach.

460
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:06,466
You…

461
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,387
Everything all right, you know?

462
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,641
Yeah. Just slept too late.
Must've fell off the bed.

463
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,977
Oh, right. Yeah, no.
That's a thing.

464
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,062
Okay, who's ready to watch
yesterday's match?

465
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:21,523
-No. No.
-I've actually watched it plenty.

466
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,818
-Don't think we should. We don't need to.
-Hey, now, look. I know, I know, I know.

467
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:27,821
-But this is how we get better, all right?
-Fine.

468
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:32,576
'Cause sometimes, every once in
a blue moon, there is a game so awful, so…

469
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,745
Dog shit?

470
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:35,954
Haunting?

471
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:38,540
A catastrophe of epic proportions.

472
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:42,002
That the only way to watch it back
is at ten times the speed

473
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:45,214
and with the Benny Hill theme music
playing under it. Here we go.

474
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:51,762
Fucking hell.

475
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:01,605
Fucking hell.

476
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:10,906
Okay.
