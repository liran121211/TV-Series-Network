1
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,891
<i>A scarf. Cool.</i>

2
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,228
<i>-Bumbercatch, did you make this?
-Yeah, man, knitting soothes me.</i>

3
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,648
<i>Sorry.
I didn't know everyone was doing booze.</i>

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,942
<i>Nah, mate. Cheers! This is great.</i>

5
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,362
<i>I can wrap it around my booze.</i>

6
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,697
<i>-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Colin.</i>

7
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,374
<i>Dani Rojas, approach.</i>

8
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,042
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

9
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>May your Secret Santa reveal himself.</i>

10
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:51,969
<i>And more booze!</i>

11
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,804
<i>All right. Let's see here.</i>

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,475
<i>Nate, is this a photo of you and me
after our first win?</i>

13
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,227
<i>-Yeah.
-Thanks, buddy. I appreciate it.</i>

14
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,562
<i>Look at that.</i>

15
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:05,065
<i>"Ted, thank you for everything
you've done for me. Nathan."</i>

16
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,943
<i>What a lovely inscription,</i>

17
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,529
<i>that you wrote completely
over my head, face and body.</i>

18
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,406
<i>Sorry.</i>

19
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:20,831
<i>Secret Santa's a fun new tradition.
As is a half-day for Christmas.</i>

20
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,749
<i>Well, I think we gotta be responsible.</i>

21
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,710
<i>We gotta save our legs
for tomorrow's big game.</i>

22
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,295
<i>So, to responsibility.</i>

23
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,797
<i>-Being responsible.
-Responsibility.</i>

24
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,217
<i>And if we get this Boxing Day win,
we'll finally have more wins than losses.</i>

25
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,847
<i>Coach, what are you doing
the rest of the day?</i>

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,515
<i>I'm just spending it with my family.</i>

27
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,268
<i>I finally make enough money
to buy something nice for my dad.</i>

28
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,520
<i>He can be very tricky to shop for.</i>

29
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,856
<i>He's one of them fellas
that buys everything for himself, huh?</i>

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,317
<i>I wish. No, he just hates everything.</i>

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,569
<i>What about you, Coach?</i>

32
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:54,865
<i>Jane and I are going to a pagan
Christmas ritual at Stonehenge.</i>

33
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,825
<i>What? I thought you two broke up.</i>

34
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,703
<i>We did, but we got the tickets
before we broke up.</i>

35
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,997
<i>So, we're going as friends.</i>

36
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,916
<i>That's gonna be…</i>

37
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,586
<i>What about you, Keeley?
What are you guys getting into?</i>

38
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,631
<i>Roy and I are celebrating a new tradition
that I'm calling "Sexy Christmas."</i>

39
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,134
<i>It's not gonna be like that.
It's gonna be a swinging--</i>

40
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,720
<i>A swinging Sinatra,</i>

41
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,556
<i>Vegas-y type Christmas for adults
where we get all dressed up,</i>

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,392
<i>and we sip on martinis, sit by the fire.</i>

43
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,728
<i>And then it's gonna be like that.</i>

44
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,691
<i>Awooga!</i>

45
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,779
<i>-You're talking about Sexy Christmas?
-Maybe.</i>

46
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,863
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

47
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,657
<i>-Let me get you a drink, yeah?
-Yes. Thank you.</i>

48
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,200
<i>How you spending
the rest of Santa's birthday?</i>

49
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,285
<i>I'm going to a Christmas party
at a friend's house.</i>

50
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,621
<i>What friend's that?
First and last name, please.</i>

51
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,705
<i>Elton John.</i>

52
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,250
<i>Holy shit!</i>

53
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,877
<i>Hold me closer, Tiny Dancer,
Prancer and Vixen.</i>

54
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,840
<i>Yes. Yes. It's actually rather lovely.</i>

55
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,717
<i>We just sing carols around Elton's piano,</i>

56
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,096
<i>and hopefully Rachel Weisz and Daniel
Craig will do their puppet show again.</i>

57
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,265
<i>That sounds like double-O heaven to me.</i>

58
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,600
<i>What about you, Higgins?</i>

59
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,270
<i>The Higginses will be opening
Christmas presents</i>

60
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,648
<i>and then hosting an open house
for players who don't have family in town.</i>

61
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,778
<i>Something we do every year.
We usually get about two.</i>

62
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,948
<i>It's really nice.
You're more than welcome, Ted.</i>

63
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,618
<i>I appreciate that offer, Higgie Smalls.
But I am all good, baby, baby.</i>

64
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,954
<i>This is the first Christmas
the family's away from each other,</i>

65
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,124
<i>so, you know, once Henry wakes up here,
in about an hour,</i>

66
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,502
<i>he wants us to open presents
and spend all day together on FaceTime.</i>

67
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:34,089
<i>It's gonna be a lovely afternoon
of yuletide cheer in two dimensions.</i>

68
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,302
<i>-Hey. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.</i>

69
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,429
<i>-Merry Christmas, Keeley.
-Merry Christmas.</i>

70
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,055
<i>How you doin'? What can I help you with?</i>

71
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,391
<i>Have you got anythin'
that I can give as a present?</i>

72
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,393
<i>Did you not buy a Secret Santa gift?</i>

73
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,769
<i>I didn't know I had to.</i>

74
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,732
<i>The email said "Secret Santa."
I didn't wanna ruin the surprise, did I?</i>

75
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,651
<i>-Oh, Jamie.
-You know what, hold on here.</i>

76
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,737
<i>Yep, here you go. Higgins, look alive.</i>

77
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,247
<i>-What are you doin'? No, no.
-Here comes a little magic pixie dust.</i>

78
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,753
<i>Whoo! There's your Christmas miracle.</i>

79
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,179
<i>God bless me… everyone.</i>

80
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,640
<i>Wow.</i>

81
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,367
<i>Okay.</i>

82
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,787
<i>Yep.</i>

83
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,165
<i>Merry Sexy Christmas!</i>

84
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,335
<i>Phoebe.</i>

85
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,257
<i>Didn't get my text, did ya?</i>

86
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,719
<i>What did it say?</i>

87
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,262
<i>My sister got called to surgery,</i>

88
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,556
<i>so Phoebe's got to spend
Sexy Christmas with us.</i>

89
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,474
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

90
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:54,688
<i>Phoebe, I'm sorry you can't spend
Christmas with your mum.</i>

91
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,941
<i>-But we'll have fun together, yeah?
-Please just leave me alone.</i>

92
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,360
<i>Apparently, she's been like this all week.</i>

93
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,029
<i>Won't talk about it.</i>

94
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,908
<i>I am sorry. I know this does make
Christmas significantly less sexy.</i>

95
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,160
<i>Don't worry about it.
We can do Sexy Boxing Day.</i>

96
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,746
<i>Can't. I've got a match all day. Working.</i>

97
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,123
<i>I can't do the day after.</i>

98
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,292
<i>Sexy December 28th.</i>

99
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,253
<i>-28th. Sexiest of all the days.
-Yeah.</i>

100
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,341
<i>Holy fucking shit. You look incredible.</i>

101
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,402
<i>What could it be?</i>

102
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,112
<i>Clearly the surfboard I asked for.</i>

103
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,116
<i>Rip it, rip it, rip it, rip it!</i>

104
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,995
<i>Perfect!</i>

105
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,330
<i>Okay.</i>

106
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,250
<i>Guests arriving in an hour,
time to clean up.</i>

107
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,669
<i>I'll get it!</i>

108
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,175
<i>Merry Christmas, and welcome to our home.</i>

109
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,678
<i>-Hello!
-Hey!</i>

110
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,763
<i>Sorry. I know I'm early,
but I was in the neighborhood</i>

111
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,267
<i>-and I really need to use the restroom.
-No, no. Sam, come in. Come in.</i>

112
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,935
<i>Thank you.</i>

113
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,437
<i>Come through. It's a bit of a mess, but…</i>

114
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,773
<i>-Yeah.
-Wow.</i>

115
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,317
<i>Yeah. To hold us off until dinner
we have mince pies,</i>

116
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,404
<i>cheese and crackers, pigs in blankets,
mulled wine. All the favorites.</i>

117
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,991
<i>So, Sam, back home, what does
Christmas make you think of?</i>

118
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,325
<i>Colonization.</i>

119
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,370
<i>Of course.</i>

120
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,416
<i>But I'm more than happy
to celebrate the day with you.</i>

121
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,252
<i>Back home in Lagos,
we have good friends who celebrate,</i>

122
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,255
<i>and they always eat jollof rice
and goat meat, so I made you some.</i>

123
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,966
<i>But I used chicken.</i>

124
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,634
<i>Thank God.</i>

125
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,972
<i>Mr. Obisanya, it was so cool
what you done with that Dubai Air logo.</i>

126
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,140
<i>Fuck those guys.</i>

127
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,977
<i>Yes, fuck 'em.</i>

128
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,320
<i>I'm really sorry,
but where's your restroom?</i>

129
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,946
<i>Right. Of course. Yes. Back through here.</i>

130
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,656
<i>To your left there, Sam.</i>

131
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,620
<i>Okay. All right. Now it's my turn.</i>

132
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,246
<i>Let's see what we got here.</i>

133
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,666
<i>Did you wrap these yourself?
'Cause this is very well done.</i>

134
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,627
<i>Uh-oh. Oh, boy.</i>

135
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,670
<i>Is this what I think it is? Hold on here.</i>

136
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,422
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

137
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,425
<i>Is this a tiny dartboard
or did I become a giant?</i>

138
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,636
<i>It's a mini dartboard. Do you like it?</i>

139
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,264
<i>That's very smart. No, I don't like it.
I love it! Thank you.</i>

140
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,558
<i>All right, your turn. Come on.
Open up the big one.</i>

141
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,101
<i>I wanna see what you think.</i>

142
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,981
<i>A drone? Dad, you got me a drone!</i>

143
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,609
<i>I know. How irresponsible is that of me?</i>

144
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,320
<i>Considering all the issues
with privacy these days.</i>

145
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,864
<i>And you know what? Mrs. Claus charged
that puppy up last night.</i>

146
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,408
<i>-So, you should be good to go.
-Can I try it out now?</i>

147
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,786
<i>Heck yeah! Yeah, it's no fun
just keeping it in the box.</i>

148
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,663
<i>-Great!
-Oh, boy. Okay. Whoa, whoa.</i>

149
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,706
<i>-Be careful. Easy.
-Mom, here.</i>

150
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,084
<i>You lost him.</i>

151
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,461
<i>Yeah, no. That's gonna happen.
Should have got him socks.</i>

152
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,297
<i>Sorry, Ted. He's just so excited.</i>

153
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,049
<i>-No, that's okay. I get it.
-Nice!</i>

154
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,259
<i>How are you?</i>

155
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:14,137
<i>I'm good. Yeah.
You know, just plugging away over here.</i>

156
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,266
<i>We got a big match tomorrow
so everybody's focused on that, and--</i>

157
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,268
<i>Henry, careful! No, not in the house!</i>

158
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,352
<i>Sorry, Ted.</i>

159
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,898
<i>It's okay. You go.
Go have fun, and send me photos, okay?</i>

160
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,109
<i>-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Ted.</i>

161
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,193
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

162
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,612
<i>Henry, careful! The baseboards!
Geez. I--</i>

163
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,545
<i>Shoot.</i>

164
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:56,513
<i>Phoebe, whatever it is,
we just wanna try and make it better.</i>

165
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:01,101
<i>What have you got to be sad about?
Did one of the Paw Patrol dogs die?</i>

166
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:07,524
<i>Listen, Phoebe, problems,
they're like mushrooms, yeah?</i>

167
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,319
<i>The longer you leave them in the dark,
the bigger they get.</i>

168
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,321
<i>A boy at school was mean to me.</i>

169
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,448
<i>What did he do?</i>

170
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:25,083
<i>"Merry Christmas, Phoebe.
I got you something you desperately need.</i>

171
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,752
<i>Your Secret Santa, Bernard."</i>

172
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,295
<i>Who the fuck is Bernard?</i>

173
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,509
<i>Why did Bernard get you toothpaste
and mouthwash for Christmas, babe?</i>

174
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,762
<i>Because he told everyone
my breath is rancid.</i>

175
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,472
<i>Right, where does Bernard live?</i>

176
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,350
<i>Roy, we are not going
to go beat up a little kid.</i>

177
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,851
<i>Why not?</i>

178
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,562
<i>Why do you think? Fucking knobhead.</i>

179
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,356
<i>Phoebe, listen.</i>

180
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,192
<i>Some kids are just mean
little dickheads, yeah?</i>

181
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,862
<i>I bet your breath doesn't smell that bad.
Come on.</i>

182
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,823
<i>Phoebe, it's me.</i>

183
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,784
<i>Let me have a smell. Come on.</i>

184
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,586
<i>Wow.</i>

185
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,880
<i>Oi! She feels bad enough!</i>

186
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,258
<i>I'm so sorry. I really tried.</i>

187
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,301
<i>It cannot be that bad.</i>

188
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,137
<i>-Go away!
-Phoebe.</i>

189
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,514
<i>I'm a monster.</i>

190
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,559
<i>I've spent the last 20 years
in locker rooms with men.</i>

191
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,436
<i>I promise you, I've smelled worse.</i>

192
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,521
<i>I don't know.</i>

193
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,022
<i>Come on.</i>

194
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,535
<i>I think you might be dying.</i>

195
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:46,206
<i>Sweetheart, listen. That is not like
"I forgot to brush my teeth" bad.</i>

196
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,001
<i>Or like, "I ate onions" bad.</i>

197
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,087
<i>That's actually medically bad.
Which means it's not your fault.</i>

198
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,340
<i>-Come here.
-Right. I'm gonna sort this.</i>

199
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,551
<i>Put your coats on.</i>

200
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,760
<i>Where are we going?</i>

201
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,596
<i>We're going to
my stupid posh neighborhood,</i>

202
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,347
<i>and we're gonna start knocking on doors.</i>

203
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,726
<i>And if we don't find a dentist
in 10 houses, you each get £1,000.</i>

204
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,354
<i>-Let's go get our coats.
-Yeah!</i>

205
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,817
<i>Quick, quick, quick, quick!</i>

206
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,736
<i>Run, run, run, run, run!</i>

207
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,449
<i>Did Santa get you
something good this morning?</i>

208
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,951
<i>It's okay. I know there's no Santa.</i>

209
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,328
<i>But of course there's a Santa.</i>

210
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,624
<i>There's no way he can deliver presents
to everyone in the world in one night!</i>

211
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,835
<i>But it's not the whole world in one night.</i>

212
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,631
<i>It's the whole world split up
into 24 different time zones.</i>

213
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:40,260
<i>You see, Santa's true power is not
his speed but his endurance.</i>

214
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,720
<i>Wow.</i>

215
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,889
<i>He got me a bicycle.</i>

216
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,182
<i>Brilliant.</i>

217
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,185
<i>-Hey!
-Merry Christmas!</i>

218
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,937
<i>-Feliz Navidad!
-Merry Christmas.</i>

219
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,984
<i>Look at that! Hello! Thank you for coming.</i>

220
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,946
<i>Of course. My mother was very happy
I wouldn't be alone on Christmas</i>

221
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,698
<i>and insisted I bring
a traditional Mexican ponche!</i>

222
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,369
<i>If you want to be a little bit cheeky,
you can put some tequila in it.</i>

223
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,914
<i>Dani, it already smells
like it has tequila in it.</i>

224
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,290
<i>Yes, this one is pre-cheeked.</i>

225
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,084
<i>Hey! What a turnout! Welcome! Welcome!</i>

226
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,252
<i>-Cool!
-Hello.</i>

227
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,586
<i>A Montlaur family tradition.</i>

228
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,923
<i>We have foie gras, champagne,
and a fancy stinky cheese.</i>

229
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,760
<i>-And this time you try it.
-Okay.</i>

230
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,762
<i>-Hey!
-I brought fried chicken.</i>

231
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,056
<i>Is that a Christmas tradition in Holland?</i>

232
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,891
<i>No.</i>

233
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,061
<i>-Yo!
-Hey!</i>

234
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,813
<i>I just walked into your neighbor's house!</i>

235
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,273
<i>Oh, my God. What's up?</i>

236
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,191
<i>Yes! Let's get drunk.</i>

237
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,690
<i>Help!</i>

238
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,736
<i>Help! Help!</i>

239
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,079
<i>Hey, boss!</i>

240
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,957
<i>How's FaceTime Christmas with Henry going?</i>

241
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,503
<i>Well, I lost him
to an overpriced guilt gift.</i>

242
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,421
<i>Hubris, thy name is Ted.</i>

243
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,424
<i>Grab a coat. You're coming with me.</i>

244
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,509
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

245
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,554
<i>And wear the hat. It's a nice touch.</i>

246
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,639
<i>Okay.</i>

247
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,395
<i>Where are we going?</i>

248
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,232
<i>You know what? Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. That's all right.</i>

249
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,528
<i>Actually, hold on. We're not going
to Elton John's holiday party, are we?</i>

250
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,030
<i>'Cause if so, I'm gonna be
severely underdressed.</i>

251
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,823
<i>I could run right back upstairs</i>

252
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,493
<i>and pop on this Donald Duck suit
I bring with me everywhere.</i>

253
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,497
<i>-You look perfect, don't worry.
-All right. I appreciate it.</i>

254
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,670
<i>Last Christmas I gave you my heart</i>

255
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:24,800
<i>But the very next day you gave it away</i>

256
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,385
<i>This year…</i>

257
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,470
<i>I love the buskers y'all got over here.</i>

258
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,515
<i>Always reminds me of that movie, Once.
You ever see that?</i>

259
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,766
<i>-Great film.
-Yeah.</i>

260
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,977
<i>Yeah, I loved Once so much,
I saw it twice.</i>

261
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,896
<i>I gave you my heart</i>

262
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,107
<i>But the very next day</i>

263
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,818
<i>You gave it away</i>

264
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:47,197
<i>This year, to save me from tears</i>

265
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,158
<i>I'll give it to someone special</i>

266
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,285
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

267
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:57,249
<i>I guess that's what I get
for taking a tinkle next to John Holmes.</i>

268
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,501
<i>Come on.</i>

269
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:01,295
<i>-Merry Christmas. Thank you.
-Merry Christmas, y'all.</i>

270
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,759
<i>You drove yourself?</i>

271
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:10,053
<i>-That's a Christmas miracle.
-Oi, wanker.</i>

272
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:11,889
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

273
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,307
<i>Right back at ya, sir.</i>

274
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,059
<i>Did he just call you a wanker?</i>

275
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,686
<i>Yeah, it's an inside joke.</i>

276
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,521
<i>Mostly inside of him.</i>

277
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,830
<i>Roy Kent!</i>

278
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:37,915
<i>You gonna sing?</i>

279
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,543
<i>No, we're not carolers.
Is your mum or dad a dentist?</i>

280
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,462
<i>No, they're lawyers.</i>

281
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,589
<i>Figures. Come on.</i>

282
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,924
<i>Thank you.</i>

283
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,011
<i>Uncle Roy, this is embarrassing.</i>

284
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,723
<i>This isn't embarrassing.</i>

285
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:59,561
<i>Embarrassing is me eating
so much ice cream at a birthday party,</i>

286
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,148
<i>knowing I'm no good with dairy,
that I poop my pants on the bus.</i>

287
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,444
<i>-Finish your story.
-Three weeks ago.</i>

288
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,656
<i>Sweetheart, none of this is your fault.</i>

289
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,032
<i>And the sooner we figure it out,
the better, yeah?</i>

290
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,828
<i>You pooped your pants? Roy Kent?</i>

291
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,248
<i>Yeah, so?</i>

292
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,291
<i>I do too, sometimes.</i>

293
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,505
<i>Well… let's both try
and knock that off, shall we?</i>

294
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,091
<i>If you can do it, I can do it.</i>

295
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,553
<i>-Cool?
-Cool.</i>

296
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,057
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

297
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:38,767
<i>-Bye!
-Come on.</i>

298
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:43,897
<i>Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

299
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,114
<i>We're not gonna make it.</i>

300
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,324
<i>Tell my incredibly
beautiful wife I love her.</i>

301
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,327
<i>I'm not gonna do that,
'cause you'll tell her yourself.</i>

302
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,664
<i>Then you're gonna hook me up
with her identical, beautiful twin sister.</i>

303
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,957
<i>Good luck, mi amigo.</i>

304
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,375
<i>Bonne chance, mon ami.</i>

305
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,339
<i>Eat Nerf!</i>

306
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,120
<i>Richard.</i>

307
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,582
<i>Why did you bring a date
to the team Christmas party?</i>

308
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,044
<i>The French believe that having
a beautiful woman around</i>

309
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,046
<i>is always a good thing.</i>

310
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,967
<i>That was not true
with the Helter Skelter murders.</i>

311
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,264
<i>Hey!</i>

312
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,016
<i>-Cheers, darling.
-Cheers.</i>

313
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,311
<i>-Hey!
-You've become quite popular, Leslie.</i>

314
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,647
<i>This is by far the most people
we've ever had.</i>

315
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,690
<i>-Merry Christmas!
-Hey!</i>

316
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,359
<i>-Welcome, guys!
-Merry Christmas!</i>

317
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,528
<i>Well, at least we've got
plenty of food and drink.</i>

318
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,862
<i>Yeah.</i>

319
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,532
<i>But where are we all
gonna sit down and eat it?</i>

320
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,408
<i>Mom! There are two white people
at the door and they're smiling!</i>

321
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,203
<i>-Can I help you?
-Good afternoon.</i>

322
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,916
<i>We work for Santa Claus,
and I believe he received this.</i>

323
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,001
<i>My letter.</i>

324
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:13,088
<i>Yes, we're terribly sorry that
your presents didn't arrive last night.</i>

325
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:17,634
<i>But as elves we've been personally
directed by Mr. and Mrs. Claus</i>

326
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:21,597
<i>to deliver your presents this afternoon
and to apologize for the delay.</i>

327
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,473
<i>Am I forgetting anything?</i>

328
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,228
<i>Well, you see what happened was
Rudolph's nose shined so brightly</i>

329
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,272
<i>that it rendered me
unable to see, and I was--</i>

330
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,232
<i>I was delirious for several minutes.</i>

331
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,694
<i>And I ended up putting this
whole sack of goodies on the wrong sled.</i>

332
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,155
<i>I mean, you know, ain't that nuts?</i>

333
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,990
<i>Anyway, this bad boy's been
around the world</i>

334
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,326
<i>at least twice over the past day so…</i>

335
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,494
<i>Yeah, you smell that?
That's the Himalayas right there.</i>

336
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,829
<i>That's all for you.</i>

337
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,706
<i>Am I getting notes of Beijing?</i>

338
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,916
<i>I bet you are, yeah.</i>

339
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,127
<i>-Thank you.
-You're so welcome.</i>

340
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,671
<i>-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.</i>

341
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,427
<i>-On to the next?
-Heck yeah.</i>

342
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:34,628
<i>-Hey, guys! Amazing! Amazing!
-Hey!</i>

343
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,258
<i>House number ten, Uncle Roy.</i>

344
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,218
<i>Oi, Phoebs. We can't lose.</i>

345
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:45,222
<i>Either we find out why your breath
is so rancid, or we get £1,000!</i>

346
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:48,475
<i>Each!
That's like a month worth of swear words.</i>

347
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,519
<i>Hold on, I've gotta fix my knee.</i>

348
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:57,150
<i>Are you Roy Kent?</i>

349
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:58,986
<i>Yeah. Are you a dentist?</i>

350
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:00,112
<i>Yeah.</i>

351
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:01,822
<i>Can we come in?</i>

352
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,783
<i>Thank you so much.
This will only take a second.</i>

353
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,285
<i>Your house is lovely!</i>

354
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:23,760
<i>Well, congratulations, Phoebe.
That is some spectacularly bad breath.</i>

355
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,179
<i>Thank you.</i>

356
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,599
<i>Have you been under
any unusual stress lately?</i>

357
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:31,351
<i>Not if I do my breathing exercises.</i>

358
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:33,478
<i>Have you been smoking?</i>

359
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:34,646
<i>No!</i>

360
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,441
<i>Any new medications?</i>

361
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,985
<i>Just my antihistamines.</i>

362
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,904
<i>They got a new cat. She's allergic.</i>

363
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,697
<i>Her name is Dauphine.</i>

364
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,368
<i>My mum said that we rescued her,
but I'd like to think that she rescued us.</i>

365
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,704
<i>Well, that's it then, Phoebe.</i>

366
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:55,250
<i>Antihistamines dry out the mouth,
and when saliva production is reduced,</i>

367
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:58,545
<i>then the environment
for odor-producing bacteria thrives.</i>

368
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,506
<i>And thrive it has.</i>

369
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:04,051
<i>Might be time
to say au revoir to Dauphine.</i>

370
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,511
<i>-No!
-Come on, Phoebe.</i>

371
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:08,722
<i>-You've only had her a month.
-But we're soul mates.</i>

372
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:13,644
<i>Phoebe, no one is gonna make you
get rid of Dauphine. Okay?</i>

373
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,396
<i>Because that would be
an insane thing for your uncle,</i>

374
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,193
<i>who loves you and
who is not a monster, to suggest.</i>

375
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,446
<i>And I'm sure Dr. Rogers
has another solution</i>

376
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,034
<i>because she's nice and smart,
and science is real, and it's Christmas!</i>

377
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,744
<i>-Right?
-Yeah.</i>

378
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,163
<i>Thank you!</i>

379
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,749
<i>Yo! Can I get an ussie?</i>

380
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,085
<i>Fine.</i>

381
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,087
<i>Not with you, mate. With Keeley.</i>

382
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,048
<i>I mean, you're a legend at Chelsea
but shit at Richmond.</i>

383
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,301
<i>But Keeley Jones was a seminal figure
throughout my teenage years.</i>

384
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:49,805
<i>How about this, why don't we all
take a picture together?</i>

385
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,265
<i>By the tree.</i>

386
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,349
<i>Wicked!</i>

387
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:01,817
<i>Un, deux, trois.</i>

388
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,362
<i>You brought jollof.</i>

389
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:10,075
<i>-With goat meat? Yes!
-Original.</i>

390
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,535
<i>You want to try some goat?</i>

391
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,245
<i>Okay. Are you sure?</i>

392
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:16,373
<i>Oh, no!</i>

393
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,378
<i>Oh, no!</i>

394
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,547
<i>-Yes!
-No!</i>

395
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,631
<i>I never win.</i>

396
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:32,848
<i>Cheers.</i>

397
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,228
<i>-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.</i>

398
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:39,521
<i>You're welcome.</i>

399
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:42,900
<i>See, doesn't it feel better to solve
the problem than go beat up a little kid?</i>

400
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:49,698
<i>Oi, you got any poster board and markers?</i>

401
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:53,827
<i>For another hundred quid.</i>

402
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,498
<i>Cheers.</i>

403
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,464
<i>That was pretty dang neat.
Thanks for letting me tag along.</i>

404
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,341
<i>My pleasure.</i>

405
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:11,929
<i>-How long have you been doing this?
-For years, but then Rupert…</i>

406
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:18,018
<i>You know, I should have done it last year,
but I just sat by myself instead.</i>

407
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:21,146
<i>Drinking and plotting horrible things.</i>

408
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,439
<i>Oh, yeah? Like what?</i>

409
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:28,153
<i>Look, I know all too well
how stunningly shitty</i>

410
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,864
<i>the first Christmas
after you get divorced can be.</i>

411
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:32,824
<i>I just wanted to make sure you're okay.</i>

412
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,952
<i>Yeah, well, I am now, you know.</i>

413
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,913
<i>A lot better than I would have been
if I just drank whiskey all day</i>

414
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,624
<i>and watched
It's a Wonderful Life on repeat.</i>

415
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,000
<i>That could have gone dark.</i>

416
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:46,380
<i>So, what now?</i>

417
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,590
<i>I figured you could just
drop me off at home</i>

418
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,677
<i>and then go get all decked out
for Sir Elton's party.</i>

419
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,930
<i>-I might not go.
-Really?</i>

420
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,766
<i>You're willing to miss a puppet show
by Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz?</i>

421
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,062
<i>-'Cause that sounds like a lot of fun.
-Don't get me wrong, they are incredible.</i>

422
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:05,190
<i>But all I really want to see
those two do together is fuck.</i>

423
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,360
<i>Yeah, no. I get that. Yeah.
You got any other ideas then?</i>

424
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,988
<i>-You'll see.
-You want me to drive?</i>

425
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:14,449
<i>-The steering wheel's on this side.
-Right, I'm the one with the accent here.</i>

426
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,868
<i>I forgot. Sorry.</i>

427
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,581
<i>Who is it?</i>

428
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,335
<i>It's carol singers.</i>

429
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:28,422
<i>Just give 'em a quid
and tell 'em to bugger off.</i>

430
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,456
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

431
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:15,260
<i>I'm sorry, Phoebe.</i>

432
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,247
<i>I just wanna thank you all for coming.</i>

433
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:45,666
<i>To the family Higgins!</i>

434
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,046
<i>You're gonna make me cry.</i>

435
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,051
<i>To my lovely wife, Julie, my sons…</i>

436
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:01,348
<i>To you and all your families
back in Lagos, Guadalajara,</i>

437
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:05,894
<i>Groningen, Cordon, Montreal,</i>

438
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:09,064
<i>Benin City, Harare, Kingston…</i>

439
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,190
<i>Ya, man.</i>

440
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:11,817
<i>…and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.</i>

441
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,320
<i>Hear! Hear!</i>

442
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,531
<i>I know you would have preferred
to have been with them,</i>

443
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:20,868
<i>but it was truly an honor
to have you with us</i>

444
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,829
<i>to share our traditions
and help make a few new ones.</i>

445
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:30,586
<i>To the family we're born with
and to the family we make along the way.</i>

446
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:34,131
<i>And most importantly to Richmond!</i>

447
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,341
<i>To Richmond!</i>

448
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:42,306
<i>-What's happening outside?
-I don't know.</i>

449
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,473
<i>What's that?</i>

450
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,352
<i>Ho ho ho, Higginses!</i>

451
00:28:56,236 --> 00:29:01,950
<i>-Oh, oh
-Christmas</i>

452
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:05,495
<i>-The snow's coming down
-Christmas</i>

453
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,208
<i>-I'm watching it fall
-Christmas</i>

454
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:12,336
<i>-Lots of people around
-Christmas</i>

455
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,047
<i>Baby, please come home</i>

456
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,175
<i>They're singing "Deck The Halls"</i>

457
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:21,637
<i>But it ain't like Christmas at all</i>

458
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,182
<i>'Cause I remember when you were here</i>

459
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:29,728
<i>-And all the fun that we had last year
-Christmas</i>

460
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,148
<i>-Pretty lights on the tree
-Christmas</i>

461
00:29:33,232 --> 00:29:36,193
<i>-I'm watching them shine
-Christmas</i>

462
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,905
<i>-Oh, you should be here with me
-Christmas</i>

463
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:42,616
<i>-Baby, please come home
-Christmas</i>

464
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,452
<i>Ho ho ho ho!</i>

465
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:51,583
<i>-Baby, please come home
-Christmas</i>

466
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:55,754
<i>-Oh, whoo
-Christmas</i>

467
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:01,301
<i>Oh, oh</i>

468
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:04,805
<i>Baby, please come home</i>

469
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:10,602
<i>-Baby, please, please
-Christmas</i>

470
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:13,939
<i>-The church bells in town
-Christmas</i>

471
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,984
<i>All ringing in song</i>
