1
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,491
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

2
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:42,084
<i>Sorry, I was waiting for you to ask if--
if I needed anything.</i>

3
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,295
<i>So, this is my mom
and dad's favorite restaurant</i>

4
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>and Friday's
their 35th wedding anniversary, Jade.</i>

5
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,259
<i>How do you know my name?</i>

6
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,388
<i>Oh, I don't. That's what
the 35th wedding anniversary is:</i>

7
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,472
<i>Jade.</i>

8
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,976
<i>Oh, weird. What time, then?</i>

9
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,437
<i>Oh, 7:30, three people and really wanna
make sure we get the window table.</i>

10
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,402
<i>You've got all the divisions…</i>

11
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,862
<i>I have to talk to Derrick.</i>

12
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,572
<i>…former England international…</i>

13
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,532
<i>Chris Kamara.</i>

14
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,659
<i>It was an unbelievable performance.</i>

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,870
<i>Do you mind just turning that up?
Thank you.</i>

16
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,080
<i>I couldn't believe it!</i>

17
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,415
<i>Looking into the championship now,</i>

18
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,792
<i>Roy, your old mob in Richmond, struggling.</i>

19
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:26,378
<i>There are a lot of theories
as to why that might be.</i>

20
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,423
<i>One that's gaining traction
is a lack of leadership</i>

21
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,800
<i>from your successor as captain,
Isaac McAdoo.</i>

22
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:35,345
<i>Isaac's a good lad. He'll find his way.</i>

23
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,974
<i>You know, under Ted Lasso, Richmond, well,</i>

24
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,311
<i>they're like a woman behind the wheel:
completely lost!</i>

25
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,689
<i>George! Didn't you lose your license
drink driving?</i>

26
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,859
<i>That was an allergic reaction
to my medication.</i>

27
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,861
<i>The same medication
that made you piss your pants?</i>

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,451
<i>Nothing coming up…</i>

29
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>So, did-- Did the--</i>

30
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,207
<i>Hey. Hi.</i>

31
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,167
<i>Good news.</i>

32
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,753
<i>We can set aside
the table in the corner for you.</i>

33
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,963
<i>Wonderful. I just--</i>

34
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,091
<i>I would really like the window table,
you know, just to impress my dad.</i>

35
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,637
<i>I'm sorry. I can't guarantee a reservation
for the window table.</i>

36
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,599
<i>I know Roy Kent, if that's--</i>

37
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,018
<i>Is he your dad?</i>

38
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,186
<i>No.</i>

39
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,439
<i>Well, please let us know
if Mr. Kent ever wants the window table.</i>

40
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,237
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

41
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,879
<i>Jan Maas, that's shit defending.</i>

42
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,589
<i>Yes, that goal was entirely my fault.</i>

43
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,633
<i>I don't wanna hear it.
We need to get our shit together!</i>

44
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,888
<i>Hey, hit pause for me, will you?
Hey, fellas.</i>

45
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,140
<i>No, I gave you an indoor whistle.</i>

46
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,100
<i>Listen, I don't care what our record is,</i>

47
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,020
<i>but I hear the chatter, people saying
there's something wrong with us.</i>

48
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,688
<i>Not the way I see it, okay?</i>

49
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,814
<i>And here's why:</i>

50
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,566
<i>I believe in communism.</i>

51
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,653
<i>Rom-communism, that is.</i>

52
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,573
<i>What is rom-communism?</i>

53
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,867
<i>Well, Bumbercatch,
it is a worldview that reminds us</i>

54
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,871
<i>that romantic comedies with folks
like Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan</i>

55
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,540
<i>or Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant or--
Who am I missing, Coach?</i>

56
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,043
<i>Drew Barrymore?</i>

57
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,670
<i>-Matthew McConaughey, obviously.
-All right, all right. Yeah.</i>

58
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,048
<i>-The three Kates.
-Yeah, Beckinsale, Hudson, Winslet.</i>

59
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,176
<i>-You forgot Blanchett.
-Different spelling.</i>

60
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,678
<i>I enjoy Renée Zellweger
and all the Bridget Jones movies.</i>

61
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,639
<i>I mean, her accent is pitch perfect</i>

62
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,891
<i>and her gift of physical comedy
is grossly underrated.</i>

63
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,935
<i>-Word!
-Hell yeah!</i>

64
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,269
<i>-Absolutely!
-I saw Judy…</i>

65
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,104
<i>All right,
you've gotta give it up for Zellweger.</i>

66
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,816
<i>Look, point is, fellas,
if all those attractive people</i>

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,277
<i>with their amazing apartments
and interesting jobs,</i>

68
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,862
<i>usually in some creative field,</i>

69
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,282
<i>can go through some lighthearted struggles
and still end up happy,</i>

70
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,367
<i>then so can we.</i>

71
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,536
<i>Jennifer Lopez!</i>

72
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,747
<i>That's a great call, Dani,
and not at all a beat too late.</i>

73
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,792
<i>Gentlemen, believing in rom-communism</i>

74
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,545
<i>is all about believing that everything's
gonna work out in the end.</i>

75
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,713
<i>Now these next few months might be tricky,</i>

76
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,424
<i>but that's just 'cause
we're going through our dark forest.</i>

77
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,761
<i>Fairy tales do not start,
nor do they end in the dark forest.</i>

78
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:06,056
<i>That son of a gun always shows up
smack-dab in the middle of a story.</i>

79
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,391
<i>But it will all work out.</i>

80
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,017
<i>Now, it may not work out</i>

81
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,312
<i>how you think it will
or how you hope it does,</i>

82
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:16,817
<i>but believe me, it will all work out.</i>

83
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,777
<i>Exactly as it's supposed to.</i>

84
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:25,325
<i>Our job is to have zero expectations
and just let go.</i>

85
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,621
<i>Now, you heard him!</i>

86
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,833
<i>We need to stop playing like shit!</i>

87
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,253
<i>Yeah, not exactly what I said,
but I appreciate you, Isaac.</i>

88
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,922
<i>Okay, let's watch the second half.
Come on, Coach.</i>

89
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,054
<i>Hey, anyone know
what's going on with Isaac?</i>

90
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,598
<i>I got no idea. No.</i>

91
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,600
<i>Maybe it's piles.</i>

92
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,979
<i>I've accepted "aubergine" and "snogging",
but "piles" I will not abide.</i>

93
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,274
<i>Wait a second,
we play Sheffield Wednesday?</i>

94
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,985
<i>-Saturday.
-Oh, we're playing Sheffield Saturday?</i>

95
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,653
<i>Sheffield Wednesday, Saturday.</i>

96
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,488
<i>We gotta play 'em twice in the same week?</i>

97
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,868
<i>The club is called Sheffield Wednesday.
We play them on Saturday.</i>

98
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,829
<i>They're called Sheffield Wednesday because
they used to only play on Wednesdays.</i>

99
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,081
<i>But nowadays they play on
whatever day they feel like,</i>

100
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,042
<i>including, but not limited to, Saturdays,</i>

101
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,252
<i>which, again, is the day
we will be playing them.</i>

102
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,921
<i>This Saturday? I can't. I got plans.</i>

103
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,964
<i>-I'm leaving.
-Oh, come on.</i>

104
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,091
<i>-Hey, Doc.
-Good afternoon.</i>

105
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,844
<i>Coach Lasso, is Isaac okay?</i>

106
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,304
<i>No, ma'am, he is not.</i>

107
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,182
<i>He's a wigwam in a tepee right now.</i>

108
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,850
<i>What does that mean?</i>

109
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,769
<i>-He's too tense.
-Boom!</i>

110
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,605
<i>He's wound tighter than my nan's hairnet.</i>

111
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,316
<i>That only makes sense if you know my nan,</i>

112
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,444
<i>but when she wears a hairnet, it looks
like puppies are trying to escape from it.</i>

113
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,697
<i>I am not crazy.</i>

114
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,701
<i>-Do you want me to talk to Isaac?
-No. That's okay. We got it.</i>

115
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,662
<i>I know exactly what Isaac needs.
Thank you, though.</i>

116
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,539
<i>Okay.</i>

117
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,585
<i>-What does Isaac need?
-Oh, I have no idea.</i>

118
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,504
<i>No, usually in this situation</i>

119
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,257
<i>I'd have a player talk to the team captain
before I intervened.</i>

120
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,967
<i>-But Isaac's our captain.
-Exactly.</i>

121
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,302
<i>And I can't very well
ask Isaac to pull himself aside.</i>

122
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,972
<i>'Cause that would be dangerously close
to messing with the, what's it?</i>

123
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,723
<i>-The dark arts?
-No, no.</i>

124
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:13,016
<i>Space-time continuum?</i>

125
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,393
<i>That's it, yeah.</i>

126
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,187
<i>-Oh.
-Fact is, Isaac is a big dog, you know?</i>

127
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,398
<i>So he's only going to
respond to a big dog himself.</i>

128
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,485
<i>I'll do it.</i>

129
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,240
<i>Oh, you're being serious?</i>

130
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,409
<i>You didn't laugh.</i>

131
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,994
<i>-You knew he was being serious?
-Yeah, man.</i>

132
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,453
<i>Shoot. Busted.</i>

133
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:38,041
<i>I'm sorry about that, Nate.
But I do appreciate the offer, you know?</i>

134
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,793
<i>I think we gotta get him a real big dog.</i>

135
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,879
<i>Yeah, no, goo-- Me too.</i>

136
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,797
<i>-Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.
-Yeah.</i>

137
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,258
<i>Okay. Let's see here.</i>

138
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,428
<i>I'm okay with "fanny".</i>

139
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,183
<i>One, two, three…</i>

140
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,730
<i>Did you just giggle?</i>

141
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,815
<i>I don't know. Did I?</i>

142
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,984
<i>Maybe.</i>

143
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,361
<i>And now you're doubling down
as Shy Rebecca,</i>

144
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,821
<i>who is a fictional character.</i>

145
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,907
<i>She does not actually exist,
so something's up.</i>

146
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,202
<i>Hey, boys!</i>

147
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,662
<i>Come get your free
Nespresso coffee machines</i>

148
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,456
<i>because I'm amazing at my job!</i>

149
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,834
<i>People who are amazing at their job
don't have to point it out.</i>

150
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:25,088
<i>Actually, that's not how it works anymore.
It's all about promoting your own brand.</i>

151
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:29,176
<i>Please don't forget to post
when you make yourselves an Americano.</i>

152
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,844
<i>I'll put something
on my Insta straightaway.</i>

153
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:31,970
<i>Thanks, Colin. Oh, wait!</i>

154
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,390
<i>Do you think you can make this one post
not about Welsh independence?</i>

155
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,226
<i>Yeah.</i>

156
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,477
<i>Thank you.</i>

157
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,482
<i>So can I, like, give this back to you
and you give me cash?</i>

158
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,150
<i>-Is that a thing, or…
-No.</i>

159
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,027
<i>Oh, yeah. Ok-- Okay.</i>

160
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,489
<i>All right, what the fuck?</i>

161
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,825
<i>Sorry. It's just this mystery man
that I've been talking to on Bantr</i>

162
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,203
<i>has just quoted Rilke.</i>

163
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,873
<i>"Our deepest fears are like dragons
guarding our deepest treasures".</i>

164
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,000
<i>Oh, that is so hot.</i>

165
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,672
<i>Maybe you're writing letters
to a hung poet.</i>

166
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,924
<i>Is that a joke from Sex and The City?</i>

167
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,551
<i>No, but thank you.</i>

168
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,094
<i>I love that you're so excited.</i>

169
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:16,014
<i>That's so Bantr,
a place where minds can come to undress.</i>

170
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,683
<i>That's really good. I'm gonna use that.</i>

171
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,809
<i>I mean, don't get me wrong,</i>

172
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,604
<i>I'm still chatting to these other guys
on the other dating app, Tumescent.</i>

173
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,273
<i>Yeah, and what was that discourse like?</i>

174
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,401
<i>Less revealing, but more revealing.</i>

175
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,486
<i>Jesus, where's the rest of it?</i>

176
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,030
<i>Christ.</i>

177
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,575
<i>I mean, shouldn't romance
have a little mystery to it?</i>

178
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,077
<i>Sure, it depends on what you want.</i>

179
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:41,039
<i>See? It all comes back to branding,
even with love.</i>

180
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,709
<i>Yeah.</i>

181
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,839
<i>Oh, Dani! Enjoy your free coffee.</i>

182
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,967
<i>Oh, I don't drink coffee.
My mother says I was born caffeinated.</i>

183
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,594
<i>Is it okay if I give it to my neighbor?</i>

184
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,596
<i>She also doesn't drink coffee
but her son does.</i>

185
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,681
<i>And she's trying to encourage
more visits from him.</i>

186
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,932
<i>Sure!</i>

187
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,726
<i>-¡Excelente!
-Oh, yeah!</i>

188
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,853
<i>-Oh, wow. Look at this.
-Sorry, Nate.</i>

189
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,605
<i>They're actually just for the players.</i>

190
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,523
<i>Oh, good.</i>

191
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,067
<i>I hate free coffee anyway,
always tastes so…</i>

192
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,113
<i>Yeah. Fine.</i>

193
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,719
<i>Hello, Rebecca.</i>

194
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,638
<i>Hello, Higgins.</i>

195
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,389
<i>What can I help you with?</i>

196
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,933
<i>Payroll.</i>

197
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,103
<i>We have an inquiry from AFC Wrexham.</i>

198
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,231
<i>Just got a call from their new owners,</i>

199
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,691
<i>showbiz magnates Rob McElhenney
and Ryan Reynolds.</i>

200
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,487
<i>I can't tell if them buying the club
is a joke or not,</i>

201
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,072
<i>so I haven't replied to them yet.</i>

202
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,408
<i>Right.
Did you just see what was on my screen?</i>

203
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,577
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

204
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,371
<i>I have five boys.</i>

205
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,165
<i>I never look over anyone's shoulders
to see what's on their screens.</i>

206
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,168
<i>I used to.</i>

207
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,254
<i>Oh, apologies!</i>

208
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,381
<i>That's my wife.</i>

209
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,633
<i>I'll ring her back later. Keeps it fresh.</i>

210
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,470
<i>But I'll just text her real quick
to let her know that.</i>

211
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,975
<i>So your ringtone for your wife is
"She's a Rainbow" by the Rolling Stones?</i>

212
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,352
<i>-Yeah.
-That's awfully affectionate.</i>

213
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,396
<i>Yeah, well, it's our song.</i>

214
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,648
<i>It was playing the moment we met.</i>

215
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,485
<i>And it's not an exaggeration.
She really is my rainbow.</i>

216
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,573
<i>It is so odd to imagine you young.</i>

217
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,283
<i>Yeah, I get that a lot.</i>

218
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,618
<i>I was the only kid in primary school
with sciatica.</i>

219
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,038
<i>I had a gelatinous L4 and five.</i>

220
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,333
<i>Leslie, do you mind me asking,</i>

221
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,252
<i>when you first met your wife,</i>

222
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,088
<i>how did you put yourself across?</i>

223
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,632
<i>You know, what was your brand?</i>

224
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,925
<i>"Brand"?</i>

225
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,262
<i>Well, you know, the night I met my wife,</i>

226
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:04,266
<i>I was attempting to be a brooding punk
with hair spiked out to here.</i>

227
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:08,770
<i>And then "She's a Rainbow" came on
and I started playing upright air bass</i>

228
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:12,191
<i>but I had a pint in my hand and ended up
pouring beer all over my head.</i>

229
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,068
<i>Everyone in the bar laughed,</i>

230
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:19,364
<i>except one person who handed me
a damp, disgusting bar towel.</i>

231
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,160
<i>And I've been married to her for 29 years.</i>

232
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:29,917
<i>I suppose…
the best brand is just being yourself.</i>

233
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,107
<i>It's fine.</i>

234
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,290
<i>-Nate?
-Yeah?</i>

235
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:11,375
<i>Do you need something?</i>

236
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,586
<i>No, me? No, me? No, thank you. No, but--</i>

237
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,344
<i>Actually, there is possibly one thing
you might be able to help with.</i>

238
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,512
<i>Yeah, come sit down.</i>

239
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,847
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

240
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,522
<i>Can you make me famous?</i>

241
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,775
<i>No! Nate, you don't wanna be famous.</i>

242
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:37,901
<i>I don't?</i>

243
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,737
<i>No!
There'll be photographers all up your bum.</i>

244
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,989
<i>Oh. Yuck.</i>

245
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,866
<i>Yeah,
and tabloids going through your rubbish.</i>

246
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:44,908
<i>I don't want that.</i>

247
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,286
<i>-Groupies everywhere?
-That's not horrible.</i>

248
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,370
<i>Nate.</i>

249
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,539
<i>Come on. You are who you are
because of who you are.</i>

250
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,667
<i>Your intelligence and your talent.</i>

251
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,712
<i>You don't wanna go messing around
with fame.</i>

252
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,175
<i>I don't know, being famous seems to have
some perks though, right?</i>

253
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,886
<i>Famous people get sent so much free shit.</i>

254
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,888
<i>Lot of the time they don't figure out
what they want.</i>

255
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:08,932
<i>I know what I want.
A window table at a restaurant.</i>

256
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,017
<i>Is that it?</i>

257
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,977
<i>Well, that plus maybe
some of those groupies</i>

258
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,228
<i>you mentioned earlier, but--</i>

259
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,273
<i>No, obviously not.
That's-- that's degrading.</i>

260
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,733
<i>I didn't mean to-- Sorry.</i>

261
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:18,942
<i>Come with me.</i>

262
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,405
<i>Come on!</i>

263
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,581
<i>Nathan needs a table at a restaurant.</i>

264
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,333
<i>Excellent.</i>

265
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,668
<i>Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester?</i>

266
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,003
<i>L'Atelier Robuchon.</i>

267
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,214
<i>Chiltern Firehouse!</i>

268
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,842
<i>No-- It's A Taste of Athens in Tooting.</i>

269
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,011
<i>Did he just say, "Tooting"?</i>

270
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,931
<i>Tooting. It's his parents' favorite place.</i>

271
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:52,059
<i>Well, it's the place
that my dad complains about the least.</i>

272
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:55,145
<i>Wait, you can't get a table
at something called "A Taste of Athens"</i>

273
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,563
<i>in Tooting?</i>

274
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:57,940
<i>No, it's impossible.</i>

275
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,025
<i>All right.
Well, there's a simple solution to that.</i>

276
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,235
<i>I'll just buy the restaurant.</i>

277
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,238
<i>Well, you know the saying?</i>

278
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,240
<i>"You buy a man a table, he eats once.</i>

279
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,408
<i>You teach a man how to get a table</i>

280
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,827
<i>and he eats at that restaurant
until it becomes a Starbucks."</i>

281
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,623
<i>Oh, this is silly!
Nathan, just be assertive.</i>

282
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,959
<i>Yes. Yes. Yes.</i>

283
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,460
<i>Brilliant. Spectacular.</i>

284
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,004
<i>Lovely. Wonderful. It's wonderful.</i>

285
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,464
<i>Perfect.</i>

286
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,842
<i>Sorry, we just-- No.</i>

287
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,011
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

288
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,556
<i>We've got work to do.</i>

289
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:41,233
<i>I told you, either you take down my photo
or you start giving me free kebabs.</i>

290
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,026
<i>7.50, mate.</i>

291
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,194
<i>Fair enough.</i>

292
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,072
<i>No way!</i>

293
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,116
<i>Fancy running into you here,</i>

294
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,494
<i>after asking Keeley where you were
and scootin' my boot right over, that is.</i>

295
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:53,662
<i>She told me to expect</i>

296
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,540
<i>a mustachioed surprise
that would anger me.</i>

297
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,504
<i>I thought it was gonna be Wario
or my great-aunt Natalie.</i>

298
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,256
<i>I don't know what makes
your aunt Natalie so great,</i>

299
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,592
<i>but I appreciate your effusiveness,
despite her appearance.</i>

300
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,220
<i>I'll have what he's having.</i>

301
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,517
<i>Why are you bothering me
at my kebab place?</i>

302
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,311
<i>This is like my church.</i>

303
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,314
<i>Who knew transubstantiation
could happen with a pita?</i>

304
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,901
<i>What do you think
about joining the coaching staff?</i>

305
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,360
<i>Fuck off.</i>

306
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,529
<i>That's a solid negotiation tactic
right there.</i>

307
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,364
<i>I don't wanna coach.</i>

308
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,825
<i>I like what I'm doing and I'm good at it.</i>

309
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:35,871
<i>People tweet about me,
with JIFs and everything.</i>

310
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,332
<i>I know some folks
pronounce it "GIFs", but I hear you.</i>

311
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,876
<i>Look,
if you enjoy doing the whole pundit thing,</i>

312
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,753
<i>then you should do it
for the rest of your life.</i>

313
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,255
<i>Why won't you let me be happy?</i>

314
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,091
<i>-Here you go, mate.
-Thank you.</i>

315
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,095
<i>-You two are father and son, right?
-What? No.</i>

316
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:53,972
<i>I'm his former coach.</i>

317
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,641
<i>It's all the same thing.</i>

318
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,851
<i>You two remind me
of me and my old man when I told him</i>

319
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,354
<i>I was leaving medical school
a week before graduation.</i>

320
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,522
<i>I bet that's a story.</i>

321
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:03,774
<i>Would have made a great doctor too.</i>

322
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,108
<i>I was really good at it.</i>

323
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,529
<i>Bedside manner,
reading charts, cutting up shit.</i>

324
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,574
<i>But it's just not what I was meant to do.</i>

325
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,411
<i>What? I love making a doner kebab.</i>

326
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,082
<i>Anyway, how's that kebab, my friend?</i>

327
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,542
<i>Well, to quote Drizzy,
it's the best I ever had.</i>

328
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,586
<i>Good, right? Cool.</i>

329
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,424
<i>Look, Roy, all kibbles and bits aside,</i>

330
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,636
<i>I'm really just here to ask you
for a favor for an old friend.</i>

331
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,304
<i>One Mr. Isaac McAdoo.</i>

332
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,015
<i>He's all up in his head, isn't he?</i>

333
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,227
<i>Yes, he is. And I need him
to check out of there by Saturday.</i>

334
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,311
<i>You got any ideas?</i>

335
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,524
<i>Let me finish my kebab and pray on it.</i>

336
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:51,947
<i>Right there.</i>

337
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,867
<i>For the collection plate.</i>

338
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,951
<i>Later, skater.</i>

339
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,791
<i>Well, this place is ruined now.</i>

340
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,254
<i>Hello, sir. Can I help you?</i>

341
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,382
<i>Yes. Nathan Shelley, party of three.</i>

342
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,301
<i>Let's see, Mr. Shelby.</i>

343
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,344
<i>Yes, Shelby.
Sorry, I should have said Shelby.</i>

344
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,638
<i>No. That is not your name.</i>

345
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:17,973
<i>-It's pretty close.
-No, no!</i>

346
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,641
<i>Start again, from the top.</i>

347
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,937
<i>-May I help you?
-Yes, Shelley, party of three.</i>

348
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,522
<i>Yes! Mr. Shelfy.</i>

349
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,524
<i>It's Shelley, and you know it,
you dithering kestrel!</i>

350
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,443
<i>-Jesus.
-No.</i>

351
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:30,527
<i>Too much.</i>

352
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,531
<i>You don't need to be loud, Nathan.
You just need to be commanding.</i>

353
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,075
<i>With all due respect,
it's different for me, Miss Welton.</i>

354
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,785
<i>You command every room you walk into.</i>

355
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,579
<i>Oh-- Hardly.</i>

356
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,040
<i>Have you ever been in a room
full of football club chairmen?</i>

357
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,124
<i>No.</i>

358
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,792
<i>Every time I walk into
one of those meetings,</i>

359
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,212
<i>they look at me like some schoolgirl
with pigtails.</i>

360
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,881
<i>-Oh, you'd look well fit with pigtails.
-I do.</i>

361
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:51,965
<i>But I have a secret:</i>

362
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,801
<i>I make myself big.</i>

363
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,595
<i>Before I go into the room,</i>

364
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,306
<i>I find somewhere private,
I stand up on my tiptoes,</i>

365
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:02,184
<i>put my arms in the air
and make myself as big as possible</i>

366
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,352
<i>to feel my own power.</i>

367
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:06,605
<i>Like this.</i>

368
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,748
<i>Fuck, you're amazing. Let's invade France.</i>

369
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,378
<i>It's a bit silly, but it works for me.
Find your own thing.</i>

370
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,463
<i>But don't back down, Nathan.</i>

371
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,508
<i>You deserve whatever you want.</i>

372
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,468
<i>Yeah.</i>

373
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,599
<i>What the hell are we gonna do
with Roy anyway?</i>

374
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,185
<i>Same thing you do when you cross
an elephant with a rhinoceros,</i>

375
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,270
<i>hell if I know.</i>

376
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,440
<i>Look, Roy just told me to bring you
to this address, ready to play.</i>

377
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,442
<i>I didn't press him for details.
You know how he gets.</i>

378
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,987
<i>-Fucking crabby, ain't he?
-Heck yeah.</i>

379
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,281
<i>Ain't no side-eye
like a Roy Kent side-eye.</i>

380
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,199
<i>It's like he's 24-7 hangry.</i>

381
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:00,868
<i>365.</i>

382
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,911
<i>366 on leap years, baby.</i>

383
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,747
<i>Seriously, do you know where you're going?</i>

384
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,040
<i>Well, no. This is it.</i>

385
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,293
<i>Here, I'll just text him.
Let him know we're here.</i>

386
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,258
<i>-Yeah, Roy?
-McAdoo.</i>

387
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,968
<i>What we doing here? What--</i>

388
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,282
<i>See that block of flats?</i>

389
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,077
<i>-What? The shit one?
-That's where I grew up.</i>

390
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:47,414
<i>This…</i>

391
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,416
<i>This is where I lived.</i>

392
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,210
<i>Where I learned football.</i>

393
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,337
<i>Every fucking day.</i>

394
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,882
<i>And during my career,
when I was going through a bad patch,</i>

395
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,092
<i>I'd come back here and play.</i>

396
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:03,764
<i>This is Isaac.</i>

397
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,809
<i>These are all the other fucks.
You're with them.</i>

398
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,395
<i>You what? You expect me to play with them?</i>

399
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,815
<i>I'm a professional, mate.
I'll fucking kill 'em.</i>

400
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,321
<i>We'll see.</i>

401
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,449
<i>-What about me? What do I get to do?
-Nothing.</i>

402
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:23,909
<i>Come on. Can I keep score?</i>

403
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,452
<i>Fine.</i>

404
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,162
<i>All right, I'm gonna use my fingers.</i>

405
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,330
<i>It's zero-zero!</i>

406
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,624
<i>-Nil-nil.
-It is nil-nil.</i>

407
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,051
<i>Hello. Shelley, party of three.</i>

408
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,095
<i>Let's see, Shelley.</i>

409
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,304
<i>No! My name--</i>

410
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,807
<i>Sorry, yes, that's correct.</i>

411
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,185
<i>In fact, that's all our names.
That's my dad there and my mum as well.</i>

412
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,937
<i>Yeah, we're all Shelleys.</i>

413
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,189
<i>-A gaggle of Shelleys.
-Stop blabbing up the young lady.</i>

414
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,024
<i>-Your mother's hungry.
-Stop it, Lloyd.</i>

415
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,526
<i>Forgive your father, my darling.</i>

416
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,195
<i>He's been wanting this saganaki all week.</i>

417
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:04,616
<i>As you may remember,
it's their 35th wedding anniversary. Jade.</i>

418
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,493
<i>Of course.</i>

419
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:09,538
<i>Right this way.</i>

420
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,760
<i>Sorry, if you remember,
I requested the window table?</i>

421
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,555
<i>Sorry, we don't take reservations
for the window table.</i>

422
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,145
<i>Excuse me one moment.</i>

423
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,839
<i>You are Nathan fucking Shelley.</i>

424
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:11,642
<i>Be right back.</i>

425
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,060
<i>Don't get too comfortable.</i>

426
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:23,028
<i>Jade,
this is a special night for my parents,</i>

427
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,404
<i>and the window table is open.</i>

428
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:26,865
<i>So,
here is what I would love to see happen.</i>

429
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,660
<i>You're gonna give us that table,</i>

430
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,912
<i>and then my family and I
are gonna order a starter,</i>

431
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,456
<i>main course, little dessert,
a bottle of wine.</i>

432
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,043
<i>And you are going to be stunned
by how quickly a gaggle of Shelleys</i>

433
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,379
<i>can get through a three-course meal
and get out of here.</i>

434
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,505
<i>So what do you say?</i>

435
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,382
<i>Okay.</i>

436
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,011
<i>Mum, Dad.</i>

437
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,472
<i>Perhaps you'd like to give me
your number as well?</i>

438
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,140
<i>No, that's okay.</i>

439
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,434
<i>Sorry, I'm picky.</i>

440
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:56,645
<i>Me too. I--</i>

441
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,106
<i>I'm not a dog.</i>

442
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,199
<i>Thank you.</i>

443
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:23,255
<i>Hey, Roy! Sure you don't wanna play?</i>

444
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,591
<i>You on one leg is better
than this fool on two.</i>

445
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,561
<i>Take that, you little bitch.</i>

446
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:41,899
<i>Easy, mate. I think you hurt him.
Emotionally.</i>

447
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,612
<i>What the fuck, Roy? Did you bring me
'round here to get my leg broke?</i>

448
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:47,696
<i>No.</i>

449
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:52,201
<i>I brought you here to remind you
that football is a fucking game</i>

450
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,203
<i>that you used to play as a fucking kid.</i>

451
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,495
<i>'Cause it was fun,</i>

452
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,123
<i>even when you were getting
your fucking legs broken</i>

453
00:24:58,207 --> 00:24:59,625
<i>or your fucking feelings hurt.</i>

454
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:01,460
<i>So, fuck your feelings,</i>

455
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,379
<i>fuck your overthinking,
fuck all that bullshit,</i>

456
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:08,884
<i>go back out there
and have some fucking fun.</i>

457
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,264
<i>All right, game on.</i>

458
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,063
<i>Was that all right?</i>

459
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:22,606
<i>That was great.</i>

460
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:24,650
<i>Too many fucks?</i>

461
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:26,777
<i>I don't know.</i>

462
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,196
<i>Kinda like all the nipples
in that movie, Showgirls.</i>

463
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,697
<i>Halfway through, you don't even notice.</i>

464
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:33,158
<i>You just kinda get sucked
into the narrative.</i>

465
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,078
<i>I dated Gina Gershon once.</i>

466
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,872
<i>That makes me happy.</i>

467
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,166
<i>Get off me!</i>

468
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,138
<i>Come on.</i>

469
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:07,526
<i>All right. Come on!</i>

470
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:18,745
<i>You gotta be kidding me.</i>

471
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,372
<i>Come on!</i>

472
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,086
<i>McAdoodle-doo!</i>

473
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,213
<i>McAdoodle-doo!</i>

474
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:29,464
<i>Come on!</i>

475
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,432
<i>Nice work tonight, Coach.</i>

476
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,601
<i>Do you really think
I'm gonna fall for this shit?</i>

477
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:41,810
<i>Fall for what?</i>

478
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:45,606
<i>You're trying to get me
to come back to the club and coach.</i>

479
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:46,732
<i>It won't work.</i>

480
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,400
<i>Roy, I got zero interest--</i>

481
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:52,070
<i>Excuse me, nil interest in making you
do something that ain't in your heart.</i>

482
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,199
<i>So, you're really not playing games?</i>

483
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,450
<i>Maybe a little.</i>

484
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:58,452
<i>I'm sorry, Roy,</i>

485
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,288
<i>but I came here tonight
'cause when you realize</i>

486
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,999
<i>you wanna spend the rest of your life
coaching with somebody,</i>

487
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:06,043
<i>you want the rest of your life
to begin ASAP.</i>

488
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,711
<i>Please stop.</i>

489
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,796
<i>You complete our team.</i>

490
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,131
<i>You're an asshole.</i>

491
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:14,760
<i>I'm also just a coach,
standing in front of a boy,</i>

492
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,136
<i>-asking him if--
-Listen,</i>

493
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,347
<i>I'm never coming back to Richmond.</i>

494
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,182
<i>Not now, not ever.</i>

495
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:22,976
<i>Now fuck off.</i>

496
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,565
<i>As you wish.</i>

497
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,786
<i>Hey, I'm sorry about that, Coach.</i>

498
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:44,623
<i>-Set your alarm for p.m. instead of a.m.?
-Yes, sir, Steve Kerr. Thank you.</i>

499
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,959
<i>-Still, you got down here pretty quick.
-Yeah, well,</i>

500
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:49,670
<i>I think a fella should only take as long
as the tune "Easy Lover"</i>

501
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,256
<i>by Phil Collins and Philip Bailey
to get dressed in the morning.</i>

502
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,799
<i>-Makes sense.
-Yeah.</i>

503
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:58,637
<i>It is a beautiful Saturday,
and we are playing Sheffield Wednesday.</i>

504
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,848
<i>-Aka "The Owls."
-Hey, how 'bout that?</i>

505
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:02,558
<i>Hey, you never finished your joke.</i>

506
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,184
<i>What joke?</i>

507
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:05,727
<i>What does a British owl say?</i>

508
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:07,271
<i>Oh, right.</i>

509
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,982
<i>Whom. Whom.</i>

510
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,277
<i>Worth the wait.</i>

511
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,296
<i>We had season tickets for Richmond.</i>

512
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,839
<i>My family was well-off.</i>

513
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:36,133
<i>I was a young punk
that snuck in every week.</i>

514
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,719
<i>My father wanted us in
the best seats in the house.</i>

515
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,346
<i>I sat there because she was there.</i>

516
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,765
<i>My mother and my boyfriend were furious.</i>

517
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:46,018
<i>They wanted to call security
to kick him out.</i>

518
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,936
<i>But she insisted that I should stay.</i>

519
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,481
<i>-And we fell in love.
-And we fell in love.</i>

520
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,110
<i>Years later, a close friend of the family</i>

521
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:58,197
<i>used the same story line
for the film Titanic.</i>

522
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,407
<i>And we've been in litigation ever since.</i>

523
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,327
<i>-Together.
-Together.</i>

524
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,956
<i>-Come on, Richmond!
-Richmond!</i>

525
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,849
<i>Just stop with the foreplay.</i>

526
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:28,227
<i>Tell him you own Richmond
and that you're fucking fit.</i>

527
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:43,867
<i>-Coach.
-Doctor.</i>

528
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,744
<i>Floor. Ceiling.</i>

529
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:46,954
<i>Trash can.</i>

530
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,121
<i>Now you go.</i>

531
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,958
<i>I was just checking in.
See how you're feeling.</i>

532
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,043
<i>Oh, well, that's mighty nice of you.</i>

533
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,461
<i>How am I feeling?</i>

534
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:55,546
<i>I don't know, you know?</i>

535
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:58,715
<i>I-- I'm just dealing with the terror
of knowing what this world is about,</i>

536
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,008
<i>you know?</i>

537
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,553
<i>Watching a few good friends
screaming to let them out.</i>

538
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:05,305
<i>So, you're feeling under pressure?</i>

539
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:06,974
<i>Ba ba ba be doo</i>

540
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,852
<i>Well, my door is always open.</i>

541
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:10,978
<i>Then why even have one?</i>

542
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:13,730
<i>Heck, Coach Beard could take
that thing out for ya Jack Torrance style</i>

543
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:14,857
<i>with eight good whacks.</i>

544
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,191
<i>Five good whacks.</i>

545
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,485
<i>Lumberjack World Championship qualifier,
baby!</i>

546
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,030
<i>That man has had many lives, many masters.</i>

547
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:24,616
<i>Oh, snap! Hottie alert. Look at this guy.</i>

548
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:26,952
<i>Hot-cha-cha.</i>

549
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,370
<i>Game day suit. I love it.</i>

550
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:29,746
<i>Not too much?</i>

551
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,665
<i>What? Too much class? No such thing.</i>

552
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:38,088
<i>If you are out to describe the truth,
leave elegance to the tailor.</i>

553
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:45,345
<i>Hey, I appreciate you checking in, Doc.
All right. Let's go, Greyhounds!</i>

554
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,556
<i>And we're back.</i>

555
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:48,974
<i>Let's round off the Premier League</i>

556
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,476
<i>with Arsenal heading
on the road to Newcastle,</i>

557
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,688
<i>where 17-year-old Matthew Kerr
will make his debut.</i>

558
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:58,192
<i>They're calling him the Irish Ronaldo.
What can we expect today?</i>

559
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:01,278
<i>Well, I think we can expect to see
a commanding performance from the lad.</i>

560
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,238
<i>Roy, what do you think he'll do today?</i>

561
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,699
<i>I don't know. He's 17.</i>

562
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,160
<i>He'll probably have chips for dinner
and a wank before bed.</i>

563
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,412
<i>Oh, apologies for the language.</i>

564
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,998
<i>Roy, I was looking for some insight</i>

565
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:15,042
<i>about how he'll play.</i>

566
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,418
<i>I told you, I don't know.</i>

567
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,379
<i>All we do is sit around here</i>

568
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:22,132
<i>and guess what a bunch of little pricks
are gonna go and do out there,</i>

569
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,383
<i>then we come back at halftime,</i>

570
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,720
<i>and we complain 'cause they didn't do
exactly what we thought they'd do.</i>

571
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,223
<i>We don't know.</i>

572
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:32,351
<i>Of course we don't know.</i>

573
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,021
<i>We're not in the locker rooms with them.</i>

574
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,439
<i>We're not on the pitch with them.</i>

575
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:40,192
<i>We can't look 'em in the eyes
and encourage them to be better</i>

576
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,444
<i>than they ever thought
they were capable of being.</i>

577
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:44,863
<i>We're just--</i>

578
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,575
<i>We're just on the outside looking in.</i>

579
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:51,328
<i>Judging them.</i>

580
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,499
<i>Okay, Roy.</i>

581
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:59,878
<i>Well, here's a look at your old team
warming up in an interesting new way.</i>

582
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,463
<i>Hey!</i>

583
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:15,978
<i>Look,
it's all pretty loosey-goosey, isn't it?</i>

584
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:17,145
<i>Especially for a team</i>

585
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:19,481
<i>that's at the business end
of the relegation zone.</i>

586
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:22,401
<i>But it is good
to see McAdoo with a smile on his face.</i>

587
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:25,320
<i>He's been a shadow of himself all season.</i>

588
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:27,823
<i>I wonder what's gotten into him.</i>

589
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,825
<i>Oh, dang.
Yeah, come on, now. Come on, man.</i>

590
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:32,327
<i>Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.</i>

591
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:33,829
<i>Pow.</i>

592
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,623
<i>There you go. All right. Gentleman.</i>

593
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:43,714
<i>Bloody cold out there today.
Bet you don't miss that, Roy.</i>

594
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:45,257
<i>What?</i>

595
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,593
<i>Said,
I bet you don't miss the cold, hey, Roy?</i>

596
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:50,429
<i>I miss all of it.</i>

597
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:53,182
<i>'Scuse me.</i>

598
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,101
<i>-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry, fellas.</i>

599
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:58,103
<i>This isn't what I'm meant to do.</i>

600
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:04,193
<i>Roy!</i>

601
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:08,989
<i>Jeff, I have to go.</i>

602
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,229
<i>Thank you. Cheers, Ben.</i>

603
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:44,691
<i>-You're Roy Kent.
-No, I'm not.</i>

604
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,819
<i>All right, I am. Take me to Nelson Road.</i>

605
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:49,112
<i>No. Headed home.</i>

606
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,573
<i>It's me anniversary, mate,
and I haven't bought a present.</i>

607
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:56,954
<i>Fuck.</i>

608
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,332
<i>Right, my wife loves cash.</i>

609
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,416
<i>Cheers.</i>

610
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,478
<i>Sorry, mate,
this is as far as I can get ya.</i>

611
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:27,442
<i>I'll tell you the thing Nikki Sixx said
in the Mötley Crüe Behind the Music.</i>

612
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,570
<i>-"You gotta date your wife."
-Thanks, Roy.</i>

613
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:38,203
<i>Fuck!</i>

614
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,331
<i>Fuck. Fuck.</i>

615
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:46,795
<i>You see this new watch?</i>

616
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,214
<i>You get me to Nelson Road
in ten minutes, it's yours.</i>

617
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,299
<i>Get in.</i>

618
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:09,860
<i>Cheers.</i>

619
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:12,321
<i>No!</i>

620
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,703
<i>-I've gotta get in there.
-Do you have a ticket?</i>

621
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,623
<i>-I can't let anyone in without a ticket.
-I'm Roy Kent.</i>

622
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:23,999
<i>-He does look like him.
-A little.</i>

623
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:25,209
<i>Around the mouth.</i>

624
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,376
<i>For fuck's sake.</i>

625
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:32,216
<i>I believe you're holding a ticket
for Reba McEntire.</i>

626
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:41,642
<i>Good to see you back, Reba.</i>

627
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,187
<i>Dad. Dad.</i>

628
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:49,942
<i>-Enjoy the game.
-Fuck you.</i>

629
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,026
<i>It is you.</i>

630
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,114
<i>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</i>

631
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:37,364
<i>Look!</i>

632
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:45,163
<i>Holy shit.</i>

633
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:48,792
<i>He's here! He's there!
He's every fucking where!</i>

634
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:52,004
<i>Roy Kent! Roy Kent!</i>

635
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,381
<i>He's here! Here's there!
He's every fucking where!</i>

636
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:57,384
<i>Roy Kent! Roy Kent!</i>

637
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,908
<i>Hello, Coach.</i>

638
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,952
<i>-Really glad you decided to--
-Shut up.</i>

639
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:25,662
<i>Just shut up.</i>

640
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,373
<i>You had me at "Coach."</i>
