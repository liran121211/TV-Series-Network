1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,886
Tartt, edge of the area.

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,431
He has options. Chooses Rojas.

3
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,477
What a goal! Great finish.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,313
You have to say, Chris,
from where they started the season,

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,066
this Richmond team is unrecognizable!

6
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,569
What a turnaround for AFC Richmond!

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:31,823
And with that Dani Rojas goal, Richmond
are now on a four-game winning streak.

8
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,700
They've certainly turned things around

9
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,620
since adding their former captain
to the coaching staff, Wrighty?

10
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,788
Absolutely, Seems.

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,291
And watching Richmond play, you could
definitely see the Roy Kent effect.

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,170
And that leads them nicely
into Saturday's FA Cup quarterfinal clash

13
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,589
against Premiership side
Tottenham Hotspur.

14
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:48,841
Yeah, good luck with that.

15
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,552
It kills me to say it,
but Tottenham are a top top side.

16
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,136
Unbelievable team.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,014
Coming up next,
we'll preview the quarterfinal

18
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,308
between Bournemouth and Southampton.

19
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,435
-Do you want a cup of tea?
-Yes, please.

20
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,945
-Sugar?
-No, thank you.

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,201
Luca, do you believe in guardian angels?

22
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,370
Are they like Guardians of the Galaxy?

23
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,750
Wait, are you naked in my kitchen?

24
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,669
Wearing a smile.

25
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,671
Put some clothes on!

26
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,549
Mina the cleaner will be here any second.

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,182
Mina. Do you want some tea?

28
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,392
Will there be biscuits with that?

29
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,476
Mother.

30
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:43,854
Hello, darling.

31
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,814
I've left your father.

32
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,193
Wait, your mum's your cleaner?

33
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,277
No.

34
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,614
He doesn't listen to me.
He doesn't respect me.

35
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,992
And Esther Perel says
it takes two people to create a pattern

36
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,577
but only one to change it.

37
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,205
I am that change.

38
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,706
Good for you.

39
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,918
Luca, will you please put some clothes on?

40
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,550
I'll start in the study.

41
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,594
Yes, thank you.

42
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,915
Hey, Liza.
Saw your Instagram post on Sunday.

43
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,708
Way to keep
that ice bucket challenge alive.

44
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,794
-Morning.
-Hey, Derek.

45
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,423
Great morning, Isabelle.

46
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,591
-Yes.
-Hey, Ted.

47
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,677
Hey, Liam.
Hey, tell your mom happy birthday for me.

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,847
And whatever gift you end up getting her,
let her know it's from both of us, huh?

49
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,227
-Morning. How y'all doing?
-Morning.

50
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,397
You're doing great work, Colin.
And I love your new mantra.

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,233
I'm a strong and capable man.
I am not a piece of shit.

52
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,402
-You don't need the second part.
-Right.

53
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,695
-Morning, Colin.
-Hey.

54
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,446
Hey, Doc.
You get in any trouble last night?

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,699
Nothing I care to speak about at work.

56
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,410
Doc, you are more mysterious
than David Blaine

57
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,912
reading a Sue Grafton novel at Area 51.

58
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,331
Well, Ted, make an appointment
when you need to talk.

59
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,624
Hey, I talk all the time, Doc.

60
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,293
Just let me follow you around
for ten minutes.

61
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,794
After five,
you'll want me to hush my butt.

62
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,630
-Lookee here.
-Morning, Ted.

63
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,216
Hey. I tell you what,
I'm shipping the heck out of you two.

64
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,594
I'm calling HR.

65
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,429
Yeah, well,
tell Mr. Pufnstuf I said hello.

66
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,600
That is a joke
for people born in the early to mid '70s.

67
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,395
And then they just
changed the shape of the tortellini…

68
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,858
Well, I don't know about you fellas,
but I am fired up for this FA Cup thing.

69
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,026
I mean, come on.

70
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,570
A March Madness tournament
in the middle of our season

71
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,864
featuring every dang team in the country?

72
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,407
Yes, please.

73
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,868
I mean, what we got?
Davids versus Goliaths, right?

74
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,996
You know? Rockys versus Apollos.
Steve Wiebes against Billy Mitchells.

75
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,332
-What's another one, Coach?
-Pearl Jam versus Ticketmaster.

76
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,084
Classic battle of art
versus commerce right there. Yeah.

77
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,419
I got a question for you though.

78
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,547
Has a team not in the Premier League,
à la us, ever won the whole chimichanga?

79
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,673
-Eight times.
-Eight times. Really?

80
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,134
But not for 40 years.

81
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,637
What have we got here?

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,805
Uh-oh.
You back into floating office mode, huh?

83
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,557
Yeah. But it's no bother.

84
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,643
I'm a flaneur by nature.

85
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,269
I get that, yeah.

86
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,771
Hey, Coach, what's a flaneur?

87
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,105
A wanderer.

88
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,567
-What the fuck's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

89
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,487
Jane and I got back together.

90
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,614
-Great news.
-Well, that's nice.

91
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,158
-Fantastic.
-How about that. Look at you guys.

92
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,536
Do you really think that's a good idea?

93
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,337
Shit. Two missed calls from her.

94
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,547
Be right back!

95
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,760
I'd like to request an emergency meeting
of the Diamond Dogs.

96
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,095
Diamond Dogs, mount up.

97
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,598
-Hey, Roy, you wanna sit in with us?
-No.

98
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,308
Okay. Yeah, shut that.

99
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:11,687
He looks a little bit--

100
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,356
Yeah, you're gonna come in through here.
That's fine. I got you.

101
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,607
Just-- Do you wanna--

102
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,650
Dukes of Hazzard style,

103
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,735
or as you guys probably call it,
"the Earls of Risk."

104
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,071
-Just go round.
-Yeah. Why don't you come legs first?

105
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,406
You wanna-- You wanna jump in?

106
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,366
You'd be in here if you just went round.

107
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,618
-Ready? Here he comes. Right--
-I'm just gonna stay here.

108
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,370
That's fine. Good idea. Probably best.

109
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,082
All right. Okay, Higgiebottoms,
you called this puppy, so start barking.

110
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,836
Well, I'm just not sure that
Jane and Beard are very healthy together.

111
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,754
And I'm a little bit disappointed

112
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,132
that neither of you backed me up
when I just said so.

113
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:42,885
Okay. Calling us out.

114
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,053
I appreciate that and I hear you, but--

115
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:48,015
I mean, in my defense,
I know why I didn't say anything.

116
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,726
-And why's that?
-'Cause you should never say anything.

117
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,603
And look, man,
I learned that the hard way.

118
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,647
One of my best friends growing up
was this fella, Marcus Girard.

119
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:59,443
He dated the same girl from grade school
to high school to college, whole time.

120
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,529
And she could be a little bit of a pill,
if I'm being honest, you know?

121
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,864
No reason to start lying now.

122
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,825
And, well, I let him know that.
I told him so.

123
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,328
And he was not too pleased, all right?

124
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,830
And that is the last time
I ever gave a best man speech.

125
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:15,417
I mean, yeah, I try to be
outwardly supportive of all relationships

126
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,711
due to my dad
sabotaging one of my first loves.

127
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,632
In year four, he sat me
and my classmate, Nadia Shookums, down

128
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,134
in the living room and said
he thought we could both do better.

129
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,137
Well, she listened to him.

130
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,598
Boy, that's a heaping spoonful
of truth soup right there.

131
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,849
Yeah. I know.

132
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,851
Look, Higgins,
I just think it's bad business

133
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,604
to get all up
in anyone else's business, you know?

134
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,065
Okay, I understand.

135
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,736
So even though this is an unsanctioned
meeting because Beard wasn't here,

136
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,655
let's just go ahead
and Diamond Dogs dismount.

137
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,161
Stupid barking means it's over, right?

138
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,246
Yes, sir. Welcome back.

139
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,998
-Ay, ay, ay. That was a doozy.
-What's wrong?

140
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,709
Jane's roommate flipped out on her.

141
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,253
-Kicked her out of the house.
-Oh, no.

142
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,547
So now she's moving in with me.

143
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,257
That's good.

144
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,092
That's great news. Congratulations.

145
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,011
Thanks, guys.

146
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,607
All right. Chin up, lads.

147
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,484
Come on, Colin. You dolt.

148
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,863
Colin, you're leaning too far back.

149
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,614
Head down, fucking whip it.

150
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,951
I am a strong and capable man.

151
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,286
Thanks, Roy.

152
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,329
Bumbercatch, great pass,

153
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,248
but it don't mean shit
if they see it coming.

154
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,333
The rest of you in the box,
when the shot goes,

155
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,835
you fucking follow it in.

156
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,004
Yeah, you smell that, lads?

157
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,380
That's the Roy Kent effect.

158
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:48,385
-Roy Kent! Roy Kent!
-Roy Kent!

159
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,850
Anything for me, coach?

160
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,979
All right, let's go again.

161
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,611
Hey, Roy. You know you're paid
to coach the whole team, right?

162
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,031
No, no, that's fine.
Just take 4% off my paycheck.

163
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,657
Ted!

164
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,951
-Ted!
-You hear that?

165
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,038
Hey!

166
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,373
Do you have lunch plans?

167
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,501
As a matter of fact, I do, yeah.

168
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,670
Coach Beard and I here
are doing Secret Sandwich Switcheroo

169
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:24,922
every other Friday.

170
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,217
-What we do is I make a sandwich--
-I don't care, Ted.

171
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,844
You're coming to lunch
with me and my mother.

172
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,095
Okay. Sounds great.

173
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,097
Spoiler alert. I made you a BLT.

174
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,767
-Samesies.
-What?

175
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,977
Crown & Anchor at 2:00.

176
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,063
Okay.

177
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,983
I look forward to lunching with you, Ted.

178
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,777
Hi, Rebecca's mom.

179
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,362
Hey, fellas. Say hi.

180
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,405
Hi, Rebecca's mum.

181
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,907
Hello, boys.

182
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,077
And the name's not Rebecca's mum,
it's Deborah.

183
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,995
I'm a work in progress,

184
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,790
a voracious book on tape listener

185
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,961
and a staunch believer
that if you get dealt lemons in life,

186
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,880
then you should make
lemon lavender mojitos.

187
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:07,965
Mum!

188
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,509
Nice to meet you, Deborah.

189
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,805
Boy, I love meeting people's moms.

190
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,474
It's like reading an instruction manual
as to why they're nuts.

191
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,476
Let's go!

192
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,562
How's Mrs. Beard doing, by the way?

193
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,605
-Full-blown QAnon.
-Yep.

194
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,279
-Hey, look alive, Coach.
-Thank you.

195
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,823
-No horseradish?
-I thought you were allergic?

196
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,157
To horses and radishes.

197
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,242
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,077
-Hi, guys.
-Hey.

199
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,205
Ted. Do you reckon you'd be up for
driving us back from lunch?

200
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,415
Sure, I'll give it a shot.

201
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,166
I've got some creative work
I wanna do this afternoon

202
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,626
and I kinda wanna be
a little buzzed for it.

203
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,379
-Seems like a great idea all around.
-Thank you.

204
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,257
One second here.

205
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,341
Hello?

206
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,177
This is him.

207
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,638
W-- Is he okay?

208
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,434
Okay. Okay. I'll--

209
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,061
Well, I mean, that's gonna be
a little tricky 'cause I'm at work.

210
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,522
No, I work in London.

211
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,900
Yeah, no, it's a heck of a commute.

212
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,611
Tell you what.
How about I call my wife-- his mom,

213
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:11,945
and then I'll see--

214
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,573
She's pulling up right now?

215
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,784
Okay, well, there you go. Crisis averted.

216
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,579
Okay. All right now. Have fun. Bye.

217
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,917
Everything okay?

218
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,543
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,338
No, Henry forgot his lunch today
for his field trip.

220
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,548
But, no, Michelle's there.
So, yeah, we're all good.

221
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,510
Hi, Keeley.

222
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,762
You got to tell Roy
he needs to start coaching me.

223
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,932
Wait. You want me to tell Roy Kent
what to do?

224
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,434
-That's a great idea.
-Yeah, he's gonna love that.

225
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,937
Yeah, I'll totally drop it
into one of our many conversations

226
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,898
where Roy talks to me about his life
and asks for my advice.

227
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,779
Philistines!

228
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,781
-Philistines.
-I'm asking for help here.

229
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,533
Jamie, you and Roy got your own history.

230
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,409
Y'all got to get together and woman up.

231
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:01,995
I think you mean man up, mate.

232
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,707
No, y'all have been manning up
for a while. Look where that's got you.

233
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,960
Keeley, you got any advice
for this young, half-dressed fella

234
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,461
on how to get through to Roy?

235
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:10,712
I agree.

236
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,715
That's a confusing way to answer
that question. Am I wrong?

237
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,051
No, I mean, I agree with Roy.

238
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,470
Just agree
with everything that he throws at you.

239
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,472
Really takes the anger wind
out of his brat sails.

240
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,475
-Shall we?
-Yes, ma'am.

241
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,562
-All right. Bon voyage.
-Bye, Jamie!

242
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,405
I don't really know how to talk to you.

243
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,866
Then it's working.

244
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,663
You're gonna wanna look up "Philistines."

245
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,965
You see, there comes a point
when you realize life is long,

246
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,550
and it's also very short.

247
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,344
And sometimes it's neither.

248
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:03,473
But it is always what it is, you know?

249
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:07,895
So, I looked him in the eye
and I said, "Paul, I'm leaving you.

250
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,316
I'm gonna live my best life now,

251
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,903
for as long as I can, until I die.

252
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,197
Or until I'm murdered."

253
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,493
And then I stood up, I flushed the toilet,

254
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,830
I pulled up my trousers,
and I walked straight out of there.

255
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,958
-That's incredible. Inspiring.
-Yeah.

256
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,418
You should do a TED Talk.

257
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:32,836
No, I agree.

258
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,422
Yeah, 'cause right now you're getting
a whole heap of "Ted listen."

259
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,216
-Yes!
-Nah! Rubbish!

260
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,468
Come on! Come on!

261
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,930
And can I just say, as someone
that's recently been divorced,

262
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,475
the best piece of advice that I received
was to leave people well.

263
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,894
-Oh, yeah. I completely agree. Yeah.
-Yeah.

264
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,855
It's slightly different in this case
because I'm the one doing the leaving.

265
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,233
And as I understand it,
your wife left you?

266
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,029
No, that is correct.
Big difference there, yeah.

267
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,156
-That's terrible!
-What is that?

268
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,867
Could you tell them to stop shouting
at the football?

269
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,620
What football?
They're watching last night's Bake Off.

270
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,747
-Look at that sponge!
-That's rubbish!

271
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,083
Temper your chocolate, you twat!

272
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,671
I'm sorry, would you excuse me?
This is my psychic.

273
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,714
She said she'd call me
exactly when I needed her.

274
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,677
That's incredible, isn't it?

275
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,011
-Yeah.
-Wow.

276
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,055
Hello, Tish. This is extraordinary.

277
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,139
Tish.

278
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,059
What a brave thing
for a woman of her age to do.

279
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,727
Is she gonna move in with you?

280
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,980
You should buy that Pilates machine,

281
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,232
and then I can teach her
when I come over and use it.

282
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,944
Please. Forget every word she just said.
They do this every couple of years.

283
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,072
My dad acts up, then she leaves him.

284
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,949
Then they "move on."

285
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,160
Then he buys her some expensive,
environmentally conscious gift

286
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,579
and they'll be back together in a week.

287
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:53,208
But, hey-ho, she'll be paying the bill,
so do enjoy your free lunch.

288
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,711
Well, I mean,
maybe it's different this time, you know?

289
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,795
People can change.

290
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,006
Some can. She can't.

291
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,091
Poor little cake

292
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,801
Soggy bottom

293
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:06,263
Poor little cake
Soggy bottom

294
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,933
Poor little cake
Soggy bottom

295
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:13,520
Poor little cake
Soggy bottom…

296
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,536
Hey. I was just thinking about you.

297
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,829
What were you thinking?

298
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,416
That if you ever left me again
I would throw myself off a cliff.

299
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,503
And I'd lay down at the bottom
so you could land on me.

300
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,254
Jane Pain.

301
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,301
So, I'm going to Cafe Solo
to meet Finn for a coffee.

302
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,554
That's cool.

303
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,932
Who's Finn?

304
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,227
My old uni friend. The underwear model.

305
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,688
He wants to go through some shoot he did.

306
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,149
I'll see you later. Bye!

307
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,046
-Big man, Roy Kent.
-No.

308
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,632
Come on, man. Why won't you coach me?

309
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,092
Because you don't deserve it.

310
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,510
You're right. I don't deserve it.

311
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,679
And the way you play is dull
and conformist.

312
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:33,267
It's true. I do play
in quite a dull and conformisty way.

313
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,650
And you're ugly.

314
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,781
You're an ugly, ugly boy.

315
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:50,868
With bad hair.

316
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,624
Say it.

317
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,212
-I am…
-Yeah?

318
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:06,425
I am an ugly, ugly boy…

319
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,890
with hair that maybe could be slightly--

320
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,225
With bad hair, fine!

321
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:20,772
Cheers. I enjoyed that.

322
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,611
-You fucking arsehole!
-Yeah. I know you are, but so are you.

323
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:26,987
I'm trying to build bridges here.

324
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,991
You couldn't fucking build Jeff Bridges.

325
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,784
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on? What's wrong?

326
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,244
This man refuses to coach me.

327
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,205
He refuses to stop being an arsehole.

328
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,539
Roy, you're not gonna like this.

329
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,125
But right now,
Jamie here is being the mature one.

330
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,170
It's true. I'm being super mature,
you big, dumb, hairy, baby twat.

331
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,338
He just wants to learn from you.

332
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,674
If you know how to make me better,
I want to hear it.

333
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:48,842
See?

334
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,595
Fine. I'll tell you what's wrong with you.

335
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,930
All right, now. Here we go!

336
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,723
You fucked him up.

337
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,600
Okay. Expound.

338
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,101
You've made him a team player.

339
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,312
You've got him to pass and shit,

340
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,689
and in doing so, you've made him average.

341
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:08,403
'Cause, Jamie, deep down, at your core,

342
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,571
you are a prick.

343
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,659
So just be a prick.

344
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,118
We need you to score more goals,

345
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,579
and we need you
to get in the other teams' fucking heads

346
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:21,583
and drive them up the fucking wall
like only you can fucking do.

347
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,167
So I can go back to being a prick?

348
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:26,755
No. I'm saying sometimes.

349
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,590
When it is appropriate…

350
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,219
yes, be a prick.

351
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,514
Okay.

352
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,516
How will I know when?

353
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,310
I'm actually curious
about that myself too.

354
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,479
We'll give you a signal.

355
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:48,026
-What signal?
-Any specifics we need to look out for?

356
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,070
You'll know it when you see it.

357
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,576
Okay.

358
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,244
Okay, that's good. All right.

359
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:00,330
-You get that?
-He said you'll know it when you see it.

360
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,456
So…

361
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,293
you know, just keep your eyes peeled and…

362
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,222
Stupid fuckin' shit.

363
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,248
Hello, sausage.

364
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,375
What time are you leaving
for the match today?

365
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,630
-Three o'clock. Aren't you coming with me?
-No. No, no, don't worry.

366
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,674
I'm meeting up
with Lavinia and Mary-Alice.

367
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,802
We're going to hear Brené Brown
reading from her new book,

368
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,722
Enter the Arena, But Bring a Knife.

369
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,182
Okay.

370
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,231
But I was thinking.

371
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:11,485
When you come home,
I'd love to make you your favorite:

372
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,529
shepherd's pie with cheesy top.

373
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,741
And then you and I can have a proper chat.
How's that sound?

374
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,618
Perfect.

375
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,953
Perfect.

376
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:29,503
AFC Richmond, a club who have never won
a major trophy in their history,

377
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,672
suddenly find themselves one win away

378
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,509
from an unlikely FA Cup semifinal
at Wembley Stadium.

379
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,511
There's nothing like the FA Cup, Arlo.

380
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,805
These are the games
you tell your grandchildren about.

381
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,732
Where'd you get that?

382
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,569
Some dodgy geezer outside the stadium.
It's not bad, eh?

383
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:58,282
Their opponents, Tottenham Hotspur,
come to Nelson Road in dazzling form.

384
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,287
I swear, if we actually win this match,
I will burn this pub to the ground.

385
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,165
I will… knock over a chair.

386
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,212
I will channel my raging enthusiasm
into ways to help my community.

387
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,672
That's so good.

388
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,220
-All right, here we go.
-Let's go!

389
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,525
We've reached the 30-minute mark,
and it's still nil-nil,

390
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,903
but it's been a corker of a game so far.

391
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:39,448
Both sides are in all-out attack mode,
Arlo. It's a proper cup tie.

392
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,457
Yes, yes, yes. Come on. Yes, yes, yes.

393
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,043
Another wayward pass.

394
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:54,379
And the baffling lack of aggression
from Tartt continues.

395
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,007
I reckon it's time for the signal?

396
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,550
-Yep.
-Yeah, okay.

397
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,178
You didn't by any chance
come up with a better one, did you?

398
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,471
No.

399
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,390
All right. Hey, Jamie!

400
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,142
Jamie!

401
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,234
Come on!

402
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:19,655
Yeah.

403
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,074
Well, you don't see that
very often, Chris,

404
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:23,742
especially in perfect unison.

405
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,245
We apologize for the fruity sign language.

406
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,872
It seems like Lasso has really
settled into our culture.

407
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,874
He certainly has.

408
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,254
Barnett, here's what's gonna happen, yeah.

409
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,382
You're gonna foul me, and I'm gonna score
all the way from back here.

410
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,466
Piss off, Tartt.

411
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,146
Hey, referee!

412
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,822
Okay. All right, here we go.

413
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,242
Back it up, boys! Come on.

414
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,287
-What'd I tell you, mate?
-You fucking--

415
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,997
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!

416
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,126
-Thank you!
-Send him off!

417
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,256
Glad he's on our team, you know.

418
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,010
Hey, what do you think? Trick play?

419
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,637
You know, maybe a Loki's Toboggan
or Upside-Down Taxi?

420
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:26,722
You don't need it.

421
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,765
The little prick's gonna fucking score
from there.

422
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,184
No way.

423
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,461
It's too far.

424
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,726
Yeah!

425
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:13,852
Are you kidding me?

426
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:16,688
Yes!

427
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:20,275
Hey!

428
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,154
Are you kidding me? Nice call!

429
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:26,114
Yeah! How about that?

430
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,325
Roy Kent effect right there.
That's what that is.

431
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,292
Jamie Tartt, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

432
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,629
Jamie Tartt, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

433
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:41,839
Jamie Tartt!

434
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,633
The first half ends with a shocking score

435
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:47,511
that will reverberate
throughout English football.

436
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,097
It's Richmond one, Tottenham nil.

437
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,140
Chris, can Richmond hold on?

438
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:53,976
If I were them,
I'd just leave the stadium,

439
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,271
go off the grid, and just pretend that
we won the game until my dying breath.

440
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,695
Your noise is back.

441
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:06,697
What's up?

442
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,660
I feel compelled to tell a friend
something he won't want to hear.

443
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:13,996
Is this about Beard and Jane?

444
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,334
I see her sometimes,
lurking around the car park.

445
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,837
I mean, she's a bit intense,
but she's adorable.

446
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:26,133
Like a tipsy Reese Witherspoon
playing Running Charades.

447
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,594
-What's Running Charades?
-What's Running Charades?

448
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:30,137
I have to say something.

449
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,431
Absolutely not.

450
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,558
Higgins, never interfere.

451
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,518
It doesn't help,
and you'll only be punished for it.

452
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,354
My parents should've split up years ago.

453
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:42,441
When she first left him when I was at uni,
I congratulated her.

454
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,651
Told her she deserved a better life.

455
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,279
Two weeks later, they were back together,

456
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,239
and she didn't speak to me
for nine months.

457
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:51,617
It does no good.

458
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,995
Well, I think if you care about someone,
you have to keep trying.

459
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,538
Maybe one day you'll get through.

460
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,541
You guys talking about Beard and Jane?

461
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,752
She's quite the jealous type, right?

462
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:05,589
She once followed me all the way home
just to ask if Beard was shagging Ted.

463
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:09,426
Ten minutes to go,

464
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,678
and since the amazing goal from Tartt,

465
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:14,515
Spurs have completely
marked him out of the game.

466
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,935
Richmond could pull off
an incredible upset,

467
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,354
but they need to hold their nerve.

468
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:44,711
You're better than that, Jamie!

469
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,090
Jamie Tartt?

470
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,176
Coach? You okay?

471
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,428
Yeah, no, I'm--

472
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:55,597
I gotta go. My stomach.

473
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,727
What's happening?

474
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,646
He said his stomach.

475
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:05,274
He can't abandon the game.

476
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,775
Well, we've seen this before.

477
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,236
Lasso appears to be leaving?

478
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,656
I know that run. That's the run
of a man who just ate a bad fish pie.

479
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,533
Chris, is there a good fish pie?

480
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:22,124
Wanker! Wanker!

481
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,792
Wait, where the fuck's that twat going?

482
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,419
Be kind. He looks poorly.

483
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:30,549
And Spurs net the equalizer…

484
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,675
Fuck!

485
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,594
…with a towering header from Barnett.

486
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:34,845
-Shit!
-I'll be right back.

487
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:35,929
Okay.

488
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:41,852
The Greyhounds were in disarray,
and Spurs took full advantage.

489
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:43,729
For fuck's sake, Lasso!

490
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,480
Every time I start to trust ya!

491
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,693
-Roy, what do you think we should do?
-We need a fucking goal.

492
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,445
What do we do? Put on a striker?

493
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:52,988
Bring on Cockburn, take off Dixon.

494
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,573
Park the bus.

495
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,658
Or put Sam and go three up front?

496
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:58,744
I don't--
We gotta be aggressive here, right?

497
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,370
I think we need--

498
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:04,208
Reynolds, Winchester, Babatunde,
you're going in.

499
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:08,545
Hey! Colin, Dani, Richard,

500
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:10,380
you're coming off.

501
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,007
-Me?
-Yes, you, Colin.

502
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,217
What's going on?

503
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,802
-Park the bus!
-What?

504
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:17,137
Park the bus!

505
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,639
No one up front. Do it.

506
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,225
-But we need a goal!
-Park the goddamn bus! Go!

507
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,228
Park the bus! Park the bus!

508
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:28,065
And it's a rare triple substitution
for Richmond.

509
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,858
-Park the bus!
-Park the bus!

510
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,652
-What's going on?
-I got this.

511
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,530
Looks like
the coaching staff are panicking, Arlo.

512
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:37,115
This is what a fish pie can do to a team.

513
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:40,244
Ted?

514
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,955
Stoppage time now,
and Richmond are completely dropping back.

515
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,082
-They're playing very defensively.
-Ted?

516
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,501
Richmond going for a draw
is a big mistake, Arlo.

517
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,337
You're the underdog.
You're at home. You go for the win.

518
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,048
-Wait, disaster for Spurs!
-Ted?

519
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:56,969
A slip by Barnett and Richmond
are on the counterattack!

520
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:01,265
Obisanya loops
a perfect diagonal ball to Tartt.

521
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,975
He shoots!

522
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,227
Tartt buries it in the back of the net!

523
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,397
Richmond, impossibly, are on top!

524
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,279
Oh, Ted.

525
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:25,163
Yes!

526
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,836
-Hey, boss. Congrats.
-Yeah.

527
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:32,880
-Where's Ted?
-I don't know.

528
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:35,007
A stomach thing.
I'll check in on my way home.

529
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,258
Great. Thank you.

530
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:39,136
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

531
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:42,264
It's good to see
the Roy Kent effect is alive and well.

532
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:44,183
Nothing to do with me. That is all Nate.

533
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,268
We're Richmond till we die!

534
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:49,563
We know we are! We're sure we are!
We're Richmond till we die!

535
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,525
Congratulations on a thrilling win.

536
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,402
Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much.

537
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,362
-What happened to Ted?
-I don't know.

538
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:58,530
Food poisoning or something?

539
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:01,033
It seemed like a negative strategy
to pull everyone into defense

540
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,117
when you needed a goal.

541
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:03,744
Yes, but I knew they needed a goal too.

542
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,495
As long as I made sure
they couldn't get through,

543
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,414
at some point, human nature,
someone would screw up

544
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:08,624
and we could exploit that.

545
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:09,917
Brilliant!

546
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,168
You said he was a lemon.

547
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,962
-Impressive by an assistant coach.
-Just did what had to be done.

548
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,964
It's not like
I'm some kind of "wonder kid."

549
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:18,050
-Some kind of what?
-"Wonder kid."

550
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,135
I think you mean wunderkind. Yeah?

551
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:22,471
Yeah.

552
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,139
Can we fix that with editing, or--

553
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,432
No, we're live.

554
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:28,852
Well, great job by Nathan Shelley,
the wonder kid.

555
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,104
-And we wish Ted a speedy recovery.
-Yeah.

556
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:33,690
-Thank you. Yeah.
-No, thank you. Thank you. Just go.

557
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,488
As someone who cares about you,
I'm concerned that you and Jane are…

558
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:44,785
Look, let me ask you one question.

559
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,996
You're a great man.
Does Jane make you greater?

560
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,752
Okay, look, I apologize.

561
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,511
Okay, okay. That--

562
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,805
I hear you. I get it.

563
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:08,600
-We will never speak of this again.
-No, no.

564
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,189
-See you Monday.
-See you Monday. Yep.

565
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,035
I missed that scared face.

566
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:28,912
I missed you too.

567
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:30,539
How was Finn?

568
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:32,875
He's like a Rembrandt.

569
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:36,086
Beautiful to look at but so dim.

570
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:39,339
Try this.

571
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:44,303
-Yeah, much better. Yeah.
-Yeah?

572
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:46,471
It's not too Oliver Twist?

573
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:49,183
Well, it is,
but that's kind of my kink, so--

574
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:50,851
"May I have some more?"

575
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:03,947
Nate, great fucking work today.

576
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,199
Thanks, Roy.

577
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:19,963
Dr. Sharon!

578
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,840
We're going for a drink. Will you join us?

579
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:25,302
Wait, are we even allowed to talk to you
at night? If not, I'm so sorry.

580
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:28,639
For a quarterfinal win,
you get me for one drink.

581
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,350
I'll see you after.

582
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:42,694
Wait for the beep.

583
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:45,405
You gotta leave your name,
you gotta leave your number.

584
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,407
Hey, Ted, it's me.

585
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:51,745
I was a bit worried about you today.
Hope you're okay.

586
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:56,500
If you need me,
just please do give me a call.

587
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,211
It's just, I'm on my way home

588
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,963
for a very difficult conversation
with my mother,

589
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:03,507
and I could really do with
one of your pep talks.

590
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:05,676
Anyway…

591
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:07,928
take care.

592
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:17,479
Mum!

593
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,026
Mum!

594
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,197
Mum?

595
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,376
"Darling, sorry to miss you. Your father
apologized and bought me a new Tesla.

596
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,047
I'll take you for a spin in it
next time I visit.

597
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:47,384
PS, shepherd's pie is in the fridge.
Needs two minutes in the microwave."

598
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:07,654
Hey, Luca.

599
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,616
Yes, it's an actual phone call.

600
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,618
No, I haven't been arrested.

601
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:15,829
I just thought you'd like to know
that my parents are away.

602
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:17,581
So we could--

603
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,833
Exactly.

604
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,001
See you soon.

605
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:37,768
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
Them boys up to something

606
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:40,395
They just spent like two or three weeks
Out the country

607
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,439
-You know all the lyrics.
-Them boys up to something

608
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,107
They just not just bluffin'

609
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,236
You don't have to call
I hit my dance like Usher

610
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:50,113
-Oy, put your phone away, mate.
-Yes, yes, yes. Okay, okay. Sorry.

611
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,198
Carry on going. You're great.

612
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:54,368
I just found my tempo
Like I'm DJ Mustard

613
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:57,746
I hit that Ginóbili
With my left hand up like

614
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:08,924
Ted, you scared me.

615
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:14,304
Are you okay?

616
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,393
I wanna make an appointment.
