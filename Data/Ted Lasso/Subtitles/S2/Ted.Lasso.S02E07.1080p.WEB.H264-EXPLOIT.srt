1
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,858
-Hey, babe.
-Hi, babe.

2
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,450
Morning.

3
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,535
Morning.

4
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,291
Hey.

5
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,376
Hey.

6
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,388
-Bye.
-Bye.

7
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,397
Oi! You're not going to your office?

8
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:09,278
No. I was just gonna go to the café
and get a cup of tea first.

9
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,529
Cool.

10
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,906
Can I come?

11
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,033
Yeah, course.

12
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,118
Sweet.

13
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,435
That's right.

14
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,647
Make another useless policy you're gonna
backtrack on in a week. Idiots.

15
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,733
Talking to the newspapers again,
sweetheart?

16
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,943
Let me know if they ever talk back.

17
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,322
Hello, hello. Hey, Mom.

18
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,324
-Hi, darling.
-Got you these. There you go.

19
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,451
Thank you. What's the occasion?

20
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,745
Nothing. You know, just an ordinary day.

21
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:02,873
Hey.

22
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,334
Look at that.

23
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,003
That's a good one, that.

24
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,511
Hey, Dad.

25
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,845
Nathan.

26
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,438
Would you look at that.

27
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,526
They'll let anyone in the newspapers
nowadays, won't they?

28
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,572
They say humility
is not thinking less of yourself

29
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,783
but thinking about yourself less.

30
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,870
My little boy wonder.

31
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,873
Yeah, sorry, Mom, but it's Wonder Kid.

32
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:49,086
Wunderkind, actually,
is what I think I said.

33
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,214
But I just… didn't…

34
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,498
-Hey, Doc.
-Hi, Ted. Come in.

35
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,209
Yeah, okay. I wanted to thank you again

36
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,962
for helping me out with that little hiccup
the other night.

37
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,591
I'm actually feeling better, so I don't
know if this is necessary, really.

38
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,176
Make yourself comfortable.

39
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,011
Okay.

40
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,848
Let me sit. I can sit here.

41
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,517
It's noisy.

42
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,104
Yes. You know what?
Hey, I'll, you know, go on the couch.

43
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,564
Here we go. How about that?

44
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,192
Hey, who am I?

45
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,235
Don Draper, right?

46
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:00,324
Yeah. Isn't that a little formal?
I don't wanna put my shoes on there.

47
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,202
You know what? I'll lay down, right?
Here we go.

48
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:07,456
I'll just pop my feet up here.
Like this, you know?

49
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,584
Like a couple kids
on their top bunk on camp--

50
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,669
I don't know what to do with my arm.
It feels…

51
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,506
Here. Here we go. This is what we'll do.

52
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,801
We'll go just classic, how you see,
like, in New Yorker cartoons.

53
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,512
Right? Know what?

54
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,598
I'll put this under here
to help even out my spine.

55
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,850
Then-- Yeah, that feels nice. Okay.

56
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,811
Now, what do I do here? Do I just--
No, that's like…

57
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,816
Like I'm going down a water slide
or something like that. Like a luge.

58
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,737
That's a little too "casket-y,"
isn't it? Okay.

59
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,697
How about-- Here, let's do this.

60
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,075
All right, how's this? This good?

61
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,619
Probably sitting is best.

62
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,206
Sure. That's good. Okay.

63
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,041
All right.

64
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,171
Yeah, there we go. There you are.

65
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,300
Quite intimate here, you know?
Close. Close quarters.

66
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,053
It's like we're on a episode
of The Sopranos,

67
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,139
without all the gratuitous violence,
which is a good thing.

68
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,142
But a lot less spaghetti and clams too,
which is a bad thing.

69
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,227
So…

70
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,064
Hey, who's this guy? What's his story?

71
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,984
You good, buddy? Yeah? Okay, good.

72
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,155
Very agreeable fella, you know?
Just doin' his thing.

73
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,075
-You got tissues over there, huh?
-Yes, tissues.

74
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,785
Yeah. What are those for?

75
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,371
Sometimes it gets a bit emotional in here.

76
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,625
-Not always, but sometimes.
-Yep, yep, yep.

77
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,294
Sometimes people just sneeze.

78
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,754
Yeah. Yeah, they do.
Well, we both agree with you.

79
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,384
Yeah. Yeah,
my hay fever's been pretty good over here.

80
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,512
Must be a low pollen count in the UK, so…

81
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,935
Okay. All right. Well, when do we start?

82
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,770
We've already started.

83
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,442
-We started when you entered in here.
-What? Shoot!

84
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,528
Well, I'm sorry. I feel like I've wasted
a bunch of time already,

85
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:05,282
with all of the couch shenanigans
and noticing your accoutrements.

86
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,909
-It's--
-Ted.

87
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:07,993
Yeah?

88
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,078
Don't worry.

89
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,583
Yeah. No, of course.
I'm not worried at all.

90
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,667
Yeah.

91
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,171
Okay.

92
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,232
What-- I mean,
what do you wanna talk about?

93
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,152
Why don't you tell me
what happened the other night?

94
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,654
Yeah. I don't wanna do this.

95
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,840
All right, come on! Come here,
come here, come here, come here.

96
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:03,924
All right, fellas.

97
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,553
Look, there are two things you can't
ever let the other team know, all right?

98
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,763
The first one's your home address.
Mark my words.

99
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,475
You'll start having food deliveries
and SWAT teams showing up 24-7,

100
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,102
which is nuts, 'cause in my day,

101
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,312
all we had to worry about
was crank phone calls.

102
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:21,233
Then, with the advent of caller ID,
that joy got 86'd from the prank menu,

103
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,444
which is a darn shame, 'cause
the Jerky Boys were a national treasure.

104
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,238
Y'all should give them a google sometime.

105
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,031
But I digress.

106
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,451
The second thing that you don't want your
opponent to know is that you're tired.

107
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,079
Okay, look, I know y'all are exhausted.
I get it.

108
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,789
But I don't want you to show it.

109
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,750
I don't wanna see y'all walking around
with your tired faces, all…

110
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,841
Okay? Just huffing and puffing
around the pitch. Uh-uh. No, thank you.

111
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,676
The only face I wanna see
from y'all is, what, Coach?

112
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,596
-Game face, baby!
-Darn tootin', Vladimir Putin. Right.

113
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,806
-Y'all feel me?
-Yes, Coach!

114
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,683
Good. Okay, good. Now, hop up there.

115
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,395
Okay. Offense, y'all gonna stick
around here with Coach Nate and Beard.

116
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,397
Defense, you're coming with me and Roy.
On the hop.

117
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,690
Move it!

118
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,737
Okay. Right.

119
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,573
Coach Nate, I hope you're not
too great to train us now.

120
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,325
Thank you, Dani. Thank you.

121
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,785
Those drills better be lit.
You've got a reputation to keep up.

122
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,371
Yes, very funny. Thank you, Jamie.

123
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,249
Lucky us. We get to be trained
by the Wonder Kid himself.

124
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,210
Big man.

125
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,671
Very funny, Colin.
You a stand-up comic now?

126
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,799
Kind of ironic, 'cause I sat you down
at the match the other day.

127
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,013
Right. I need all our best goal scorers
on the pitch right now. Go.

128
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,267
Colin, Colin.
You can sit this one out, okay?

129
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,274
I am a strong and capable man.

130
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,443
I am a strong and capable man.

131
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,655
That's my mantra.

132
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,907
Cool.

133
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,378
Bro, it's been two days. Still nothing?

134
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,296
-No.
-Ouch, man.

135
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,924
Sometimes three dots appear,
but then they go away again.

136
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,051
It's over, man. I've messed up.

137
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,137
Don't be negative, amigo. There might be
a good reason she hasn't replied.

138
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,889
Yeah, maybe she got hit by a bus.

139
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,267
Or a train?

140
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,894
It's more likely she lost interest
in the relationship.

141
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,605
Maybe she went back
and saw how lame these texts are.

142
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,899
"My favorite film's Ratatouille."

143
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,609
Hey, listen. Okay.

144
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,862
It doesn't matter.
I don't care if she doesn't--

145
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,613
Three dots. Three dots.

146
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,953
That's a kick in the plums.

147
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,204
Next time, man.

148
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,212
Oh, my God. Just answer him.
It's been two days.

149
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,214
I don't know what to say.

150
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,299
How about the truth?

151
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,551
"I'd love to meet up,

152
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:56,597
but I'm worried that you can't live up
to the fantasy I've created in my head.

153
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,682
So I'm going to let my insecurities

154
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,186
keep me from possibly finding
my one true love."

155
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,191
His favorite film is Ratatouille.
That's worrying, right?

156
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,859
Meet him.

157
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,320
Who fucking cares
what his favorite movie is?

158
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,031
Also, Ratatouille
is a goddamn masterpiece.

159
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,534
Ironically, it's about snobbery and how
good art can come from anywhere.

160
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,703
Stop your dithering
and go fuck your cartoon rat.

161
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,623
All right. Well, what if we meet up
and it all goes wrong?

162
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:28,045
I mean, everything always goes wrong.
All relationships are a nightmare.

163
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:32,132
My relationship is the oxygen
that gives me life.

164
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:35,844
Apart from Leslie's marriage, which is
a bloody greeting card of some kind.

165
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:40,849
And you and Roy are just
aggravatingly perfect in every way.

166
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:42,935
Thank you.

167
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,104
I don't know.

168
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,399
It was definitely easier
when we didn't work together.

169
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,778
I just feel like we're around each other
all the time.

170
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,822
Wherever I go, he's my shadow.
My adorably hairy shadow, but--

171
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,288
What's going on?
Why are you jazz scatting?

172
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,750
Were you talking about me?

173
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,752
-Yeah, we were talking about you.
-No.

174
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,304
-Big whoop. You ready to go?
-Yeah.

175
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,307
Answer him.

176
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,310
-Bye.
-Bye.

177
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,691
Two, three, four.

178
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,912
-Hello.
-Hello.

179
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,331
-You nearly done?
-God, no.

180
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,750
To-do list's as long as my arm.

181
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,295
What? This arm?

182
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,758
Maybe.

183
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,219
Oi, that's not helping me.

184
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,306
All right. I'll give you your arm back.

185
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,515
Thank you.

186
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,601
I'll take your neck.

187
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,485
Seriously, I have got a lot of work to do.

188
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,863
So if you're gonna be here,
you need to go sit quietly on the couch

189
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,281
and read your book, yeah?

190
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,952
Thank you.

191
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,099
That's not helping me either.

192
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:50,020
What? I'm doing exactly what you said.
I'm sitting quietly and reading my book.

193
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,316
You doing exactly what I tell you to do
is so fucking hot.

194
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,046
-Hello, Ted.
-What's up, Doc?

195
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,215
I'm surprised you came back.

196
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,925
Yeah, well, I don't quit things.

197
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,563
-How are you, Ted?
-I'm swell, as well as fine and dandy.

198
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,481
-How about you, Doc?
-I'm well.

199
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,566
Glad to hear it.

200
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,528
So, is this your first time doing therapy?

201
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,240
No, ma'am. My wife and I did
couple's therapy for a little while.

202
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,450
How was that?

203
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,827
Well, let's see.

204
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,038
I'm here in London,
and my wife is back in Kansas,

205
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:53,083
which is a good thing 'cause if she heard
me referring to her as my wife still,

206
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,585
she'd be hopping mad.

207
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,962
How long these little chats you do take?

208
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,381
Sessions typically last 50 minutes.

209
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,925
Okay. But you charge by the hour, right?

210
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,385
That's correct.

211
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,351
I take it you're not a fan
of this kind of work?

212
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,728
No, ma'am.

213
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,104
Why's that, do you think?

214
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,856
You want the truth?

215
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,525
I'm only interested in the truth, Ted.

216
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,154
'Cause I think it's bullshit.

217
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,992
You don't know me. We don't have history.

218
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,036
And yet you just expect me
to spill my guts

219
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,455
about all the gory details of my life.

220
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,875
The fights, the mistakes,
my deep dark secrets.

221
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,920
But you ain't listening
'cause you care about me.

222
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:42,174
No. No, you're only listening to me
'cause you're paid to listen to me.

223
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:47,387
You're getting paid to just jot down
your little notes and diagnose my tears.

224
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,932
And then what?
Probably just blame it on my folks, right?

225
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,602
I mean, you say you're only interested
in the truth.

226
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,939
And yet here you are, charging an
hourly rate for only 50 minutes of work.

227
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,273
Like I said, it's bullshit.

228
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,791
-Hey.
-Nathan.

229
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,380
Oh, my God.

230
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:22,798
-Sorry.
-Sorry, Sam.

231
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,174
Ms. Welton. Hi.

232
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,426
-Call me Rebecca.
-Rebecca. Rebecca, sorry.

233
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,387
These machines, huh?

234
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,265
We've never been so connected,
yet never further apart.

235
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,270
Is that what you were gonna say?

236
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,147
Yes. Yes, it was.

237
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,403
-All right. Have a good day.
-Right. I'll see you later.

238
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,446
-You too. Bye.
-See you, Sam.

239
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,658
Yes.

240
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,542
Hello. Your new pens have arrived.

241
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,260
I'll just leave 'em here.

242
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,344
Yeah, all right.

243
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,180
'Kay.

244
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,556
Sorry. Didn't see you there, Colin.

245
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,640
It's the camouflage.

246
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,270
Nate, wonder if I could have a quick word?

247
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,646
Yeah, go for it.

248
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,069
I just wondered-- Well, I was wondering
if I'd done anything to annoy you.

249
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,331
It's just because I felt like you got
angry at me for taking the piss yesterday,

250
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,709
but Dani and Jamie did the same thing,
and you didn't get mad at them.

251
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,129
Yeah, I can--
Yeah. No, I can explain that.

252
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:50,552
You see, Jamie and Dani
are like Picasso and Gauguin.

253
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:51,762
Pedophiles?

254
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,015
Artists. They're artists.

255
00:16:55,098 --> 00:17:00,145
And, Colin, you paint too, but your work
doesn't end up in museums.

256
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,105
It hangs at--

257
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,276
Well, you're like a painting
at a Holiday Inn, you know?

258
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,071
You don't inspire. You don't move people.

259
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,367
You're there. You cover a bloodstain.

260
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:19,289
You do the job, so… just do the job.

261
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,416
All right?

262
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,663
It's you.

263
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,498
Hi.

264
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,083
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.

265
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,086
What? I have. This is just
covering up the smell of the boots.

266
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,004
That's smart.

267
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,007
Then why you in here?

268
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,800
I just needed some space.

269
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,763
I knew you'd be in here.

270
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,727
This is the room where Keeley
and I decided that smoking doesn't count.

271
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,648
Busted.

272
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,276
-I did also need some space.
-Space from what?

273
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,904
Roy. He's sitting in my office
reading Da Vinci Code.

274
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,115
He keeps muttering on about
the Knights Templar.

275
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:44,458
Sorry, I just came to the boot room
to get some… boots.

276
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:47,711
Knock yourself out.

277
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,213
Thank you.

278
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,508
Look, I think Roy is the cat's pajamas.
I do. You know that.

279
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:55,260
It's just sometimes I need
a moment to myself, you know?

280
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,430
Keeley, stop auditioning your complaints.

281
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,098
Right. Thank you.

282
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,770
Just tell the person
who can actually do something about it.

283
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,689
Well, I don't know, boss.
Sometimes it's good to bottle things up.

284
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,441
That's how we get, you know, pickles.

285
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,277
-And vodka.
-Extra virgin olive oil.

286
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,196
-And messages.
-What?

287
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,448
-In bottles.
-Right.

288
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,784
Oi, Will, do you think you could take
me name off me shirt

289
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,619
and then put it back on but bigger?

290
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,206
The fuck?

291
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,625
-They're talking about Roy.
-What?

292
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,627
-Sorry.
-Grumpy old twat.

293
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,170
I agree with the grumpy part,

294
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,755
but the other two words
I take umbrage with.

295
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,091
Roy is none of those things. He's perfect.

296
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,927
And I should know because I spend
every minute of every second

297
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,096
of every hour of every day
with him, all right?

298
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,640
Right, just tell him that you--

299
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,101
Hi, babe.

300
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:45,894
You talking about me?

301
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,063
-Yes.
-Definitely.

302
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,108
-Ready to go?
-Yeah.

303
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,027
-Bye.
-Bye.

304
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,322
Adios, muchachos.

305
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,032
-How you doing?
-Hey.

306
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,994
The Knights Templar business
is fucking with my head.

307
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,250
Because your shit is lying around.

308
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,252
You got more shit lying around than I got.

309
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:14,798
What? Look at this place!
It's loaded with your shit. Just--

310
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,092
Just look at this bathroom!
Look at all your shit…

311
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:18,177
What's up?

312
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,804
-What's up?
-What's going on?

313
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,472
I'm just watching Sex and the City.

314
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,475
What are you, a crazy bag man?

315
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,768
They're different smells.

316
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,438
Well, enjoy. I'm gonna read.

317
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,606
Cool.

318
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,360
Wait a minute. You use Rogaine?
I didn't know you needed--

319
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,070
It's preventative.

320
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,865
-Is your hair falling out?
-I don't wanna talk about it!

321
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,493
It seems it's not only women
who have secret single behavior.

322
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,246
This is my stuff!
Don't be going through my stuff.

323
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,290
You were more than happy
to go through my stuff.

324
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,250
No way.

325
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:58,091
I don't ''always do'' anything.
And I have let you in.

326
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,345
You can't put it down
'cause the chapters are so short.

327
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,096
Shut up.

328
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,807
-Shut up?
-Yes. Shut up.

329
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,559
You're telling me to shut up?

330
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:08,644
Oh, my God.

331
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:10,437
Please, just shut up!

332
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:13,106
This geezer wears like a spiked belt
around his thigh--

333
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,358
Fucking hell, Roy!

334
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,486
What? Do you want me to read it to you?

335
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:20,656
No. I-- No, I just wanna watch my TV show,

336
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,283
and you're rucking ruining it for me!

337
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:28,288
I just need some time
without you reading or turning me on

338
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:31,250
or just fucking being there all the time!

339
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,002
You don't want me to turn you on?

340
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:38,006
No! I-- Yes, I do, sometimes.
Just not all the time.

341
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,051
Sometimes I need to be by myself.

342
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:48,559
Wait, is this what you've been talking
to everyone about?

343
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,936
Yeah. But you don't care.

344
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,021
I didn't when I thought
it was the usual stuff

345
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,315
like gossip or how much hair
I leave in the drain.

346
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,484
It is a lot of fucking hair.

347
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,695
You've been making out to everyone
like I'm following you around

348
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,823
like a needy,
clingy fucking fridge magnet.

349
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,077
I'm an idiot.

350
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,413
Fuck this!

351
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:23,927
Shit.

352
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,310
And surprise hero of the week,
assistant coach Nate Shelley

353
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,104
with a heroically ballsy
late-in-the-game strategy

354
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,606
that put Richmond into the semis.

355
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:36,940
We can all agree,

356
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:39,860
the Wonder Kid
should be managing his own team.

357
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:43,488
Savage instincts,
and if I may say, an excellent serve--

358
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,449
God. Wow.

359
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,493
It's you. Sorry.

360
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,704
You were rude to Colin.

361
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,625
Not just rude. It was personal and weird.

362
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,755
No, you're absolutely right…

363
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:01,590
Did you tell Ted?

364
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,176
No. This is just between me and you.

365
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,427
Okay.

366
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,595
Do better.

367
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,722
The door is behind you.

368
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,559
Yeah.

369
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:15,562
Wait, this is my--

370
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,669
Hi.

371
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,929
I had porridge for breakfast.
Thanks for asking.

372
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,723
"How was it?"
That's a great follow-up question, babe.

373
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,935
It was too hot and, honestly,
it was too thick,

374
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,313
so burnt my tongue on it
and I almost choked to death.

375
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:00,023
Not a good morning so far.

376
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:03,861
Hello, Ted.

377
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,239
I thought you'd be back.

378
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,492
Really? Why's that?

379
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:11,994
You said you never quit.

380
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,433
Can I be honest with you about something?

381
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,018
What? I got a boogie in my 'stache?

382
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,855
No-- I'm kidding. Sorry, go ahead.

383
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:43,984
I was quite offended by what you said
about my profession…

384
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,155
that just 'cause
a therapist is being paid,

385
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,698
they don't actually care.

386
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,868
Let me ask you something.
Would you coach for free?

387
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,037
Yeah, I would.

388
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,455
But do you?

389
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,207
No, ma'am.

390
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,375
And yet you care
about your players, right?

391
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:01,835
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,171
Then why would you assume
it's not the same for me?

393
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:08,050
I don't assume that
all coaches are macho dickheads.

394
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,095
It's a good point.

395
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,390
Consider me dunked on.

396
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:20,437
And look,
I'm really sorry about that, you know.

397
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,565
Getting all worked up and saying
stuff like that, then storming outta here.

398
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:25,150
It happens.

399
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,569
Self-care can be scary.

400
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,407
Fight or flight is a natural response.
You just happened to do both.

401
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:33,742
Impressive range really.

402
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,745
Yeah, well, watch your back, Glenn Close.

403
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:44,503
So you think I'm scared, huh?

404
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,088
Yes, I do.

405
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,090
Yeah.

406
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,634
Maybe I don't wanna learn the truth.

407
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:55,097
Ted, the truth will set you free.

408
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:57,808
But first, it'll piss you off.

409
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,856
Well, then maybe your new nickname
should be "The Truth."

410
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:09,152
Well, I can't be your mentor
without occasionally being your tormentor.

411
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,654
I like that.

412
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,030
I knew you would.

413
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,617
Let's get started, shall we?

414
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,411
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:35,262
That's right, gentlemen.
Big deep breaths while you stretch.

416
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,890
You wanna get that sweet O2
all the way down to your prostate.

417
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:40,225
And, hey, remember to focus
on the here and now.

418
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,312
Living in the moment, it's a gift.
That's why they call it the present.

419
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,646
Yes.

420
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,357
Okay, before we get started,
Coach Nate, you wanted to say something?

421
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:49,902
-Yes, please. Thank you, Ted.
-Have at it, Jessica Rabbit.

422
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,404
Yeah. Oi… thank you--

423
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,574
I just wanted, before we started, just to…

424
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,578
well, basically,
I just wanted to make an apology.

425
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:01,872
Colin,

426
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:05,709
yesterday I was a bit of a, you know…

427
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,294
-Asshole?
-Prick?

428
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,504
Cock?

429
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:09,838
Wounded butterfly.

430
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:14,259
Yes. I was a cocky, prickish,
wounded butterfly's asshole…

431
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:20,140
but I-- I really am sorry,
and it won't happen again, so…

432
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,271
-It's all good, boyo.
-All right then.

433
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:28,690
That's good.

434
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:30,150
-All right.
-Come here.

435
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,820
-Okay.
-Did I miss something?

436
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,365
Okay. Yeah. All right.

437
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,075
Anything I need to address?

438
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,788
Well, like I always say,
sometimes the best stew

439
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,915
is the one you leave
sitting on the stove overnight

440
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,251
'cause you fell asleep watching
Citizen Kane after too many beers.

441
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,502
I know, Colin. I know.

442
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,172
All right, fellas! Hey!
So here's the plan today.

443
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:53,757
Peas and carrots,
you're going with Coach Roy.

444
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:56,718
Rest of you beef chunks are coming
with me. Let's go to work.

445
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,264
What?

446
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,767
Starters with Roy, reserves with Coach.

447
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,102
Right.

448
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,229
Just say that then.
Do you know what I mean?

449
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:10,065
Here Richard, Richard! Richard!

450
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,696
Whistle!

451
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:18,615
Oi! I said, "Whistle!"

452
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:21,326
Roy, why don't you just use
an actual whistle?

453
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,413
I told you, my lips are sensitive
to impure metals

454
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,248
and whistles give me mouth hives.

455
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:29,501
Jamie, what the fuck were you doing?

456
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:33,547
Richard loses his man, gets into the box,
and you run the other way?

457
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,300
I was pulling my defender out of his path.

458
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,551
He's your teammate.

459
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:40,304
He needs you to come to the ball
and support him.

460
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,638
You all got that?

461
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:47,769
Respectfully, Coach,
that ain't what he needs from me.

462
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:50,314
He needs me to give him space.

463
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:53,901
What'd you say?

464
00:28:56,862 --> 00:29:00,115
The best thing I can do
in that situation is give him space.

465
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,617
He's right, actually.

466
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,911
-Yeah, I know. I learned it from Pep.
-He got it from "Cruijff".

467
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,621
-Pronounced "Cruyff."
-Okay, Englishman.

468
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:09,082
Look, whatever. The point is that
Richard doesn't need me to crowd him.

469
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,292
And since he's me teammate,

470
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:13,420
I should trust him
to do what's best, right?

471
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,141
Fuck!

472
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,565
I didn't say nothing bad this time.

473
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,985
There he is, there he is!

474
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,281
Coach Nate, we have a gift for you.

475
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:44,117
Yeah. Good thing you apologized,
otherwise this would be awkward.

476
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:50,499
"Wonder Kid."

477
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:53,001
I mean, because of you saying that
instead of "wunderkind,"

478
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,545
which is the proper pronunciation.

479
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,422
-Wow.
-It was Will's idea.

480
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:58,841
Hey.

481
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:00,300
Was it?

482
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,178
Well, you know, it's a pretty
awesome nickname, so cheers.

483
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:04,763
Cheers.

484
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:08,517
No, thank you.
I mean, I did say wunderkind, but…

485
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,270
But, Will, this is great.
It's really funny.

486
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:12,896
-It's good, man.
-Thank you.

487
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:15,649
Thank you.

488
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:23,407
"If music be the food of love, play on.

489
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,033
Give me excess of it."

490
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:28,537
If that's your fancy way of asking
if I want another one, you guessed right.

491
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,621
Thought so.

492
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:32,040
Bear with me.
I'll be out in two seconds. Cheers.

493
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,335
Of all the pub joints.

494
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:39,131
Trent Crimm of the Independent.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

495
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,550
I was just having a bite to eat, you know?

496
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:45,512
But as we're here,
I would love to get an official statement

497
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:47,931
about your early departure
from the Spurs match.

498
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:50,851
An official statement?

499
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,687
Well, I thought folks knew
I had food poisoning.

500
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:55,856
Not from here.

501
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:03,071
Yeah, yeah. They do. But I'd love
a personal quote, if possible.

502
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,741
Okay, well, I had food poisoning.

503
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,160
And because I respect
your readers so much,

504
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:11,330
I'll leave out all the specific nastiness
that occurred.

505
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,248
-Yeah.
-But I'm fit as a fiddle now.

506
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:17,503
So you had food poisoning
and you are fit as a fiddle now…

507
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,882
Exactamundo, Dikembe Mutombo.

508
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:24,885
Love our chats.

509
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:27,763
Thank you, Mae.

510
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,389
My pleasure, darling.

511
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:50,827
Shit.

512
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,415
Roy?

513
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:04,550
Hi.

514
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,510
Hi.

515
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,847
Are you leaving?

516
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:11,890
What?

517
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,976
No.

518
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:25,863
Hey, Siri.

519
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:29,992
Play the "Roy is sorry
for not understanding Keeley" playlist.

520
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:36,164
I stole those roses
from your neighbor's garden.

521
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:37,958
Ripped them to shreds.

522
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:39,877
And that…

523
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,590
that's Phoebe's light,
so I'm gonna have to give that back

524
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,216
or I'm gonna get it in the neck.

525
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:52,848
And that, that's a foot scrubber
or something.

526
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,893
The woman said it's good
if you've got gross feet.

527
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,812
What? You think I've got gross feet?

528
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:03,734
Babe, I think you're the cat's pajamas,
but your feet are a fucking state.

529
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,239
But who am I to judge?

530
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:11,825
I found so much of my hair down the drain,

531
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:16,788
it looked like a rat had got trapped
and fucking drowned.

532
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:27,925
Oh, my God.

533
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:39,603
Now, you are not gonna see or hear me
for at least three hours.

534
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:49,613
Thank you.

535
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:51,382
If you ever do anything
to humiliate me again,

536
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:53,177
I'll make your life a fucking misery.
