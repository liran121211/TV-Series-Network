00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,167
Good thinking.

28
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:28,733

00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:41,800
Hey! Give that back!
I tell you!

181
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,267
WALLY:
And one for you!

182
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,933
YAY-OK: I am just going to take
what does not belong to you...

183
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,933
Could I please just get
back the possessions

184
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,200
that technically
do not belong to you -

185
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,900
[Roar]

186
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,433
Oh dear...
Sorry?

190
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,767
Everything is gone!

191
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,900
The mission is a
complete failure!

192
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,433
King Killya is
going to crush me.

193
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,133
I'm finished.

194
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,800
Done. Over.
Kaput.

195
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,100
Turn out the lights
the party's over!

196
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,367
Relax, bro bot.

197
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,200
WALLY: Here,
have an omelet.

198
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,900
I don't really eat food,

199
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,067
but if I'm going
to be crushed,

200
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,167
I may as well try it...

201
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
[Chewing]

202
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,967
Huh. I tell you,
this actually isn't half bad.

203
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:30,667
What is in it?

204
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,600
The usual -
bananas, onions,

205
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,967
a half-dozen ruby-incrusted
antique eggs...

206
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,967
[Spit take]

207
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,867
Monkeys! I tried to keep you
out of this mission,

208
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:42,633
but if we don't
return all of the treasure

209
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,333
in perfect condition,

210
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:46,867
King Killya will
robo-crunch me!

211
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:49,400
Flatten...
flatten me.

212
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,767
[Hyperventilating]

213
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:55,433
Nothing...

214
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:56,833
left of Yay-OK...

215
00:08:56,933 --> 00:09:00,867
Sounds like someone's got a
case of the grumpy-wumpies.

216
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,933
I know what you need.

217
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,133
Hugs!

218
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,867
Yes, hugging is nice.

219
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,900
Here's an issue -
kind of important -

220
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,167
SOMEONE SHOULD BE
DRIVING THE SHIP!

221
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,700
Ah...

222
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,133
Note to self -

223
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:19,867
Always wear a seat belt.

224
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,900
KING KILLYA:
About time you arrived!

225
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,933
I want my precious
property NOW!

226
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:28,533
Funny thing about property,
Mr. Killya.

227
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:31,067
I mean who really
owns anything anyway?

228
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,867
Who are we
anyways?

229
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,733
Why are we
even here?

230
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,067
Gimme... stuff...
NOW!

Ta-da!

234
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,133
Excellent!

235
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,767
But how is that possible?

236
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,067
Looks like I
won't have to

237
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,367
[chewing noises]

238
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,067
you after all.

Bun Bun is going
to be so happy!

240
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,133
What trickery is this?!

241
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,533
My treasure...

242
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,367
gone!

00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,767
I have nothing!

244
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:11,733
Well not
nothing-nothing...

00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,600
Sharing?

247
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,500
I'll show you sharing!

248
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,833
One for you.

249
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:20,567
And one
for you!

250
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:21,600
And another!

251
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,200

256
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,267
But Bunbuns!

257
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:39,800
They gave away all my
kingdom's priceless treasures.

258
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,433
It was all for you!

259

It's just stuff.

260
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,267
Besides,
I've got my boys...

and I've got my Pookie!

And I've got
this jukebox.

to be screamed at
and treated poorly.

to my room.

like your brother?

are the best, GG!

too cold."

this anymore!

Gamgam off this ship.

she's cruel.

all of those things!

I do not like her.

But giving your
gamgam the boot

348
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,633
is a bit, uh, drastic,
don't you think?

349
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,900
What do you think -
Stacked heel or steel toe?

350
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,100
Gus, you are
all worked up.

351

Don't you talk to me
like that, young man.

this robot here?

harnessed the power

396

I'm improvising.

laser-blast Gamgam!

It's a risk I'm
willing to take...

475

Hello!

888
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:25,600
Where do you want me
to put these?

889
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,167
Thunderbot!

890
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:28,867
Oh!
How much for the robot?

891
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:30,200
How dare you?

892
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,167
Friends don't sell friends.

893
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:33,667
What if I gave you this?

894
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:34,867
[whistle]

895
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,500
[angels singing]

896
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,067
[gibberish]

897
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,733
So we have a deal?

898
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:43,200
[squealing]

899
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,900
Monkeys,
you know I am GASI property.

900
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:47,333
I cannot be sold for profit--

901
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:48,567
[scream]

902
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,233
[sinister laugh]

903
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,733
Yay-Ok would be proud
because we sold something.

904
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:54,867
YAY-OK:
Not proud!

905
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:56,067
Someone help Yay-Ok!

906
00:36:57,367 --> 00:37:00,133
[cackles]

907
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:01,367
After years of searching,

908
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:03,100
my creepy obsession
has finally paid off.

909
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,100
The one, the only Thunderbot.

910
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,933
And uh, what makes you think

911
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:10,867
I am this so-called Thunderbot?

912
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:12,100
Please, you're Thunderbot.

913
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,467
I got all your collectibles.

914
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,300
I got your action figure,
your plushie,

915
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,767
your trading cards,
your jock strap,

916
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,267
your bubble bath, your lipstick
and your deodorant!

917
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:20,967
I got your toothbrush,
I got your sponge...

918
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:22,067
Fine.
Okay.

919
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,633
So I was Thunderbot.

920
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:26,400
But I am not part of your
creepy nerd collection!

921
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,600
Hey!

922
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,267
I bought you fairsies and
squarsies from those monkeys,

923
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:31,733
and that means one thing...

924
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,800
Press conference!

925
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,067
Press
conference?

926
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,300
Where did that come from?

927
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,700
Did I miss something?
What is?

928
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,600
Who? What?

929
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,100
Thunderbot!
Oh. Over here!

930
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,067
Me! ME! Please!
Thunderbot!

931
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:43,800
Quick question over here!
Quick question!

932
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,933
Fine, okay.
I'll play along.

933
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:47,933
Hey! You...
over there?

934
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:49,267
The one who is not a nerd.

935
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,633
Gamester X from The Daily X!

936
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:52,300
How many episodes of "The
Adventures of Thunderbot"

937
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,933
did you make?
Too many.

938
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:56,300
In episode 65, when you
battled Sarcasmatron

939
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,633
for the Sword of Isosceles,

940
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,667
did you guys really
fall in love?
Just friends.

941
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:02,100
What happened to
your robo-horse, Zozo?
Rehab.

942
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,433
In the last episode
of Thunderbot

943
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,767
you were strapped
to a doomsday rocket

944
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:07,300
on a collision course with
the Blaze-omedra star.

945
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,667
Then the show just ended.

946
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:10,833
ANNOUNCER: Attention,
fans of Thunderbot.

947
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:12,333
This show has been canceled

948
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:14,067
due to its high
level of POOPINESS.

949
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:15,867
So what happened?

950
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:17,067
I'll tell you what happened,

951
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,167
the producers stiffed me
on the royalties.

952
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:20,200
Thanks for nothing, Ira!

953
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,167
Huh?

954
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,133
Oh, you mean
with the character?

955
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:25,700
Nothing.
It's only TV!

956
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,167
It is not real.

957
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:29,333
Not real?
NOT REAL!

958
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,533
I'm about to show you
just how real it is!

959
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:35,433
Monkeys!

960
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:39,600
Did you hear something?
Yeah, I did.

961
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,467
As the writer/
director/producer/

962
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,300
of the official
Thunderbot finale,

963
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,333
I want this done right,
people!

964
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,700
Give me screaming
for your life

965
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,067
and then a miraculous escape
from certain, fiery death.

966
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,867
[maniacal laughter]

967
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:55,867
MOTHER:
Myron!

968
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,500
Inside voice!

969
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,867
You're cruisin'
for a timeout, young man!

970
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:03,100
[sigh]
Sorry, Mom!

971
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,233
(quietly)
I'm not sorry!

972
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,667
I couldn't even
be less sorry right now...

973
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:07,800
Listen.

974
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,300
How 'bout I just
sign a glossy 8 by 10

975
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,067
and we'll call it
a day, huh?

976
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,267
Quiet on the set!

977
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:13,667
You will never succeed!

978
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:15,400
My monkeys will rescue me!

979
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,733
Now that was
a successful yard sale!

980
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,633
Absopooply, we didn't
even sell anything.

981
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:29,067
Except for that old timey robot.

982
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,333
What was his name again?

983
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:32,100
Why do I have to
remember everything?

984
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:36,067
Isn't Yay-Ok supposed
to clean up after us?

985
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,500
[crickets chirping]

986
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,100
Hey, that's his name!

987
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,067
We sold Yay-Ok!

988
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:42,400
We should get him to clean up.

989
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,633
Good idea, bro.

990
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:47,100
[screaming]

991
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,567
More tension,
Thunderbot!

992
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,367
[doorbell]
Where's my latte?

993
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:52,233
MOTHER:
Get the door, Myron!

994
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,267
I don't have
my face on yet!

995
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:55,733
(shouts)
I got it, Ma!

996
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,767
What do I have,
a sign on my back

997
00:39:57,867 --> 00:39:59,900
that says
'breathe down this'?

998
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,233
Whoa!

999
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,867
Take back your bananas.
We want our robot.

1000
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,200
Hey, Wal,
look!

1001
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,267
[gasp]

1002
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:09,500
It's Thunderbot's
thunder punch fists!

1003
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:11,900
Take that!

1004
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,233
[indistinct cross-talk]

1005
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,600
No!
That's original packaging!

1006
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,233
But we love Thunderbot!

1007
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,467
TOY:
Ira, I want my residuals!

1008
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:23,933
We used to watch it
all the time.

1009
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,933
* FROM THE SCRAP YARDS
OF THE HEAVENS *

1010
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:27,433
* THERE WAS BORN A LEGEND!

1011
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:30,400
Where do you want me
to put these!

1012
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,033
So where's Yay-Ok?

1013
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,867
[sigh]
Open your eyes, monkey.

1014
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,367
Yay-Ok is Thunderbot!

1015
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:40,533
Hilarious.

1016
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:44,200
Yay-Ok and Thunderbot
don't look anything alike!

1017
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,233
[scream]

1018
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:49,833
I forgot how
dangerous acting was.

1019
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:51,067
Huh.
Whadya know?

1020
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:53,033
Yay-Ok is Thunderbot!

1021
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:54,233
And you think you know someone!

1022
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:57,200
You are watching the official
Gamester X production

1023
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,433
of the Thunderbot finale

1024
00:40:58,533 --> 00:40:59,900
which I wrote,
produced, catered,

1025
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,267
and am currently directing.

1026
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:03,533
I remember the series
being less screamy.

1027
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:06,067
I blame the writing, producing,
directing and catering!

1028
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,133
And the acting!

1029
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:09,333
Criticism accepted!

1030
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,267
Help, Monkeys!

1031
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:12,533
Help!

1032
00:41:12,633 --> 00:41:15,067
You see, that's what's wrong
with this direction.

1033
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,800
No super hero would say,
"Help, monkeys, help!"

1034
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,967
Yeah, who asks monkeys
for help?

1035
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:22,133
(chuckles)
We're useless.

1036
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,333
MOTHER:
Myron!

1037
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:24,833
Do your furry little friends

1038
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:25,967
want some numnums?

1039
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,133
(shouts)
Ma!

1040
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:28,767
No one wants numnums!

1041
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:30,400
I could go for some numnums.

1042
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,100
Am I the only one here
that could go for numnums?

1043
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,333
I'm in for numnums.

1044
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:34,833
(shouts)
Cut!

1045
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:36,800
[sigh]
Take five!

1046
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,400
You gotta be kidding me
with this stuff.

1047
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,767
No touchy!

1048
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,967
You heard what he said,
no touchy!

1049
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,067
[monkey shrieks]

1050
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,200
[screaming]

1051
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,167
Ugh!

1052
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:51,900
Track left....
Your other left!

1053
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:53,833
Okay turn the camera
upside down...

1054
00:41:53,933 --> 00:41:54,867
...and Dutch it!

1055
00:41:54,967 --> 00:41:56,833
Okay no sound.
No sound on this one.

1056
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,067
No lights.

1057
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,900
Okay give me a nod.
Give me a nod. Push in.

1058
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:01,067
...and pull out...

1059
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:03,367
Let's do a couple takes
without the cameras on.

1060
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:04,867
Could you uh,
kill that light there

1061
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:06,733
and then put the shadow
under his face?

1062
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:08,067
Let's switch
personalities.

1063
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,100
Just switch 'em
real quick.

1064
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,667
but an anti-bounce
over his neck?

1065
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:14,800
Can we get the boom
in the shot?

1066
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,467
Can we get
the boom in the shot?

1067
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,067
Can we get the boom out
of the shot, please?

1068
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:19,600
Boom out!
Boom in!

1069
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,900
Boom out!
Okay, just bring it in a bit...

1070
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:22,233
Boom out!
I just wanna see
the tip of it...

1071
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,933
Boom out!
Just a little bit
of boom in the shot.

1072
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,733
Okay, but put
a furry thing on it.

1073
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,667
Okay.
Numnums are here.

1074
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:29,167
Where do you want me
to put these?

1075
00:42:29,267 --> 00:42:30,400
...put these...
...put these...

1076
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,767
[gasps]

1077
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:33,700
Wally, did you hear
that delivery?

1078
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,067
Now, that's acting!

1079
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:37,300
Oh, I've got monkeybumps.

1080
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
You should be
in the movies.

1081
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,167
Well, I do fancy myself
the super hero-type.

1082
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:43,967
I already
have the costume.

1083
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:45,100
TH-TH-TH-THUNDERBOT!

1084
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,433
You convinced me.

1085
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:48,067
That part needs
a new hero... Me!

1086
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,200
(shouts)
Cut!

1087
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:52,867
Oh, my bolts!

1088
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:54,333
That was close!

1089
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:55,933
Sorry, kid, this just
isn't working out.

1090
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:57,467
You're looking
a little rusty...

1091
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,067
The whole screamy thing
is pretty played out...

1092
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,767
and just everything
you're bring to it is...

1093
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:02,733
[gag sound]
I don't like it!

1094
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,100
Alright.
Tie me in tight!

1095
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,500
[excited giggles]

1096
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,900
This has to look real!

1097
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,167
Happy to oblige.

1098
00:43:08,267 --> 00:43:10,100
All right!
ACTION!

1099
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,767
[maniacal laugh]

1100
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:13,133
I knew you'd rescue me.

1101
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:14,667
Thank you, gentlemens.

1102
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:16,067
For what?
You were terrible.

1103
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:18,300
Your baby screams
were ruining the finale.

1104
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,300
HEY MA!

1105
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,467
LOOK AT ME!
I'M A STAR!

1106
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:22,833
[loud explosion]

1107
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,067
Guess we now know
how Thunderbot ends.

1108
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:27,467
Stinko.

1109
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:29,100
I've seen more emotional
depth in a teaspoon.

1110
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:29,933
Yeah, and really.

1111
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,300
I get it.

1112
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,800
You fly into the star,
you die.

1113
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,933
But what about the mother?

1114
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:35,967
They don't even deal
with that part.

1115
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:43,700
[organ music]

1116
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,767
Cut!

1117
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:46,067
You call that a tribute?

1118
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,667
Come on, what,
do I gotta do everything here?

1119
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,200
Okay, move the lights in.

1120
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,767
Lets get a nice close-up.

1121
00:43:50,867 --> 00:43:51,967
Whaddya mean
we're out of time!

1122
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:53,633
Might as well cast
my mom in this thing

1123
00:43:53,733 --> 00:43:55,633
for all the good you
guys are doing me... Ow!
