It marks the twentieth year of Forrester Creations. And it's shaping up to be another wild success. That's what his younger son, Thorne, believes. But his elder son, Ridge, is less than happy about the new line. It's flat. It doesn't turn him on. Ridge's dissatisfaction turns to irritation when Bill Spencer, the father of Caroline, a woman--but not the only woman--Ridge is dating, shows up at Ridge's office and demands that he break off his relationship with her. Ridge ignores him and sees Caroline that night. His attempt to seduce her fails: she's saving herself for the man she marries. Impulsively, Ridge asks her to marry him... Katie Logan is fantasizing that a magazine-cover hunk is romancing her and loves her in spite of her acne. Just then, her older sister Brooke rushes inside the house. Her clothes are torn; she's dirty and bruised. Later, David Reed, her boyfriend who is also a police detective, shows up and asks her questions about what happened. It seems two men had tried to rape her... Eric and Margo's flirting leads Ridge to wonder if the two of them are having an affair.\u2014J.
