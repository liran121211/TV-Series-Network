This soon changes, though: Eric informs Stephanie that he will not wait any longer and that she will get the divorce papers later that day. Meanwhile, Grandma Logan is served with papers to declare her son Stephen legally dead and is furious with Storm for doing it. When Storm comes home, he tries to explain to Helen why his court filings are the only right thing to do because it is merely accepting the inevitable: that his father is long dead. In Utah, Conway locates the hotel in which the missing Mr. Logan is presumably staying in.\u2014Torsten B.
