1
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,520 
That can't be Cristal.

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,440 
I refuse to believe that's Cristal.

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,920 
Oh, my God!

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,640 
As a talent manager,
I spend my days checking on influencers.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,560 
And there's something about
Jade's Instagram that just doesn't add up.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,480 
When it comes to social media,
I know what I'm talking about.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,520 
And Jade's content doesn't really align
with someone who'd have a huge following.

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,440 
-You know, I've been doing my stalking.
-Yes.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,760 
Bring it over. I need to see.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,800 
There are programs which allow brands

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,840 
to type in anyone's username
and see where their audience lives,

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,120 
what interests the audience have.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,520 
The game is up. We can see everything.

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,760
{\an8}So his top audience

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,960
{\an8}so, where he has
the most followers is Turkey.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,360
{\an8}With 451,000 of 1,2 million.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,360 
-So, 37% of his audience live in Turkey.
-Turkey.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,880 
The other sus one is Iran.

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,480 
When you buy audience it's from places
like Turkey and Iran and India.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,400 
They're where you get fake audience from.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,960 
I spent my career trying
to make influencers a real thing

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,640 
and be taken seriously by brands.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,960 
But stuff like this
walks back all that work

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,160 
that I've done
to make people take what I do seriously.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240 
-Yeah.
-Because this is taking the piss.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,840 
What infuriates me
is there's so many online creators

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,080 
who are building
their audience the right way.

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,560 
That it takes time
and effort and creativity.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,280 
You can't buy your way in.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,520 
So, I know I'm gonna
have to confront him about this.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,720 
The reckoning has begun.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,800 
It's basically me rolling up
and going, "You're full of shit."

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,000 
There's no easy way
to come back from this.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,360 
Look at this.
There's the ocean in the background.

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,720 
Yes.

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,600 
I feel like one of the best
things that I've done

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,080 
is move down here to Byron.

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,960 
I mean, the people that I've met so far…

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,360 
And the energy is just
a total vibe and a half.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,640 
-Are you guys--
-Mommy's calling again.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,360 
-Mom's calling again?
-Yeah.

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,560 
-Hi, Mama!
-Hey, Mom.

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800 
<i>Hey. I nearly hung up on you.</i>

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,400 
-She's gorgeous.
-Nothing.

45
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,600 
-This is my friend Lauren.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,080 
<i>-Hi to Lauren.</i>
-I'm just going to go and talk to my mom.

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,400 
-I won't be long.
-Bye. Nice to meet you.

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,600 
<i>-Nice to meet you too.</i>
-We'll have a drink soon.

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,760 
Yes.

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,040 
Sorry. I've just been doing…
I'm just creating content with Lauren.

51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,520 
So, I'm sorry I haven't been
able to answer your call.

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,720 
<i>I look at Instagram</i>

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,960 
<i>to see what you're doing</i>
<i>when I can't hear from you.</i>

54
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,720 
-So--
<i>-Turn your head to the side again.</i>

55
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,160 
<i>That is not a dollar sign.</i>

56
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,400 
It is.

57
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,280 
It's a dollar sign.

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360 
What?

59
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,320 
Why do you always
pay me out about what I'm wearing?

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,120 
I have a really
complicated relationship with my mom.

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360 
We used to be best friends
when I was growing up.

62
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,000 
And we were a solid, united front
and I wanna go back to that with her.

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,800 
But, since I've become an influencer,
she's just been really critical of me.

64
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,240 
I've been going to the gym a lot
and I've been choosing healthy options.

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,320 
And when I have a little bit to drink,

66
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,400 
instead of going fast food,
I will go a healthier option.

67
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,760 
So, I hope you're proud of me.

68
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,720 
<i>Except for what I see on Instagram.</i>

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,200 
<i>Too much drinking, too much bad food.</i>

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,480 
Growing up was tough.

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,560 
I got bullied a lot about my weight.

72
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,160 
It was a hard time.

73
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,000 
So, I started Instagram to make friends.

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,520 
My followers are there supporting me 24/7.
They mean everything to me.

75
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,360 
Finally, I also have real friends.

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,400 
-Okay. I love you.
<i>-I love you too.</i>

77
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,240 
-Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

78
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,840 
-Sorry, babe.
-That's all right.

79
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,240 
What did you think of Jessie's launch?

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,760 
-The launch was fabulous.
-Yeah.

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,480 
-Absolutely killed it.
-Yeah. I think--

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,520 
I heard they're at it again
with the whole fucking Alex bullshit.

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,040 
-What?
-Apparently Alex turned around

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,920 
and said, because Jess had mentioned

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,440 
that she was working
on this for quite some time,

86
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,760 
"Have you been in your room
selling this for six years?"

87
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,600 
-Are you joking me?
-Yeah.

88
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,400 
-Six years in the making?
-Yeah.

89
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,360 
Does it take
six years to do a fashion line?

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,240 
Would that take you six years?

91
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,280 
Darl, that will take me
a trip to Spotlight.

92
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,000 
He's honestly the sassiest little bitch.

93
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,280 
What the fuck? Who is this guy?

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,880 
Alex has pissed off
a lot of people in town

95
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,400 
and now he's come after
Jess and her business.

96
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,240 
Don't come for my friends or for me.

97
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,000 
He's gone and said that at Hannah's.
Now he's saying this now.

98
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960 
I've gone up and introduced myself
to him a couple of times

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,480 
and he's been completely…
Doesn't wanna bother.

100
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,440 
So, why is he staring at you
the whole time?

101
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,880 
-Remember at Hannah's?
-I know.

102
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,480 
I almost wanna ask him,
"What the fuck is your problem?"

103
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,480 
-Yeah.
-But he needs to be fully confronted.

104
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,080 
-Yeah. 100%.
-Yeah.

105
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560 
I just don't understand
what his motive is.

106
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,560 
I just see Alex, right now, as a bully.

107
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,720 
And I know that I need
to support my friends.

108
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,840 
I really do wanna be there for them.
No matter what it is.

109
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,760 
I'm making some chai. Want some?

110
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,200 
Man, chai's my favorite.

111
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,920 
These are sick.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000 
Yeah. I was just actually
getting things ready for the show…

113
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160 
-Coming up.
-Man, incredible.

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,000 
Look at this curious mind you have.

115
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,160 
With this particular show,

116
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,720 
I think that it would be
quite smart to get, you know,

117
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,400 
some people who don't know my work

118
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,520 
and see
what their reactions to the art is.

119
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200 
And that's where Simba's
really helping me out.

120
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,320 
Breaking it down… This is the play on
the Byron Bay call of the blow-in.

121
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,680 
So, I thought,
playing around with fabric and stuff

122
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,360 
and this really symbolizes that
in more of an artistic way.

123
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,360 
Someone's a blow-in if they've just
rocked up from somewhere else.

124
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,080 
And then they're here now.
And they're calling it home.

125
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,120 
Yeah.

126
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,160 
Hey, boys.

127
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240 
-How are you?
-How are you, beautiful man?

128
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,720 
-Good seeing you.
-Good. Yeah.

129
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,600 
-I hope you don't mind I grabbed an apple.
-Is that from my fridge?

130
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,560 
Yeah, brother.

131
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,960 
-Hey, that's for lunchtime.
-It's for your recess.

132
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,680 
How are ya?

133
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,120 
-Whatcha doing?
-I was checking some artwork.

134
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,000 
Sick. You should get Sarah
to sing at your event.

135
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,760 
She sung to me the other day.
It was pretty sick.

136
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,400 
-Really? That was a little bit of a flex.
-Yeah.

137
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,400 
-That was a lowkey flex.
-"She sung to me on the beach."

138
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,080 
-Yeah.
-That's pretty cute.

139
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,000 
I'm psyched on Sarah playing.

140
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,960 
I'm all about having
that sort of creative mix as well.

141
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,880 
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

142
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,480 
'Cause I think if I can show this
as well as her showing off some stuff…

143
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,400 
She also was saying to us that,
you know, she wants to

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000 
know more people
around the area and stuff.

145
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,280 
-And this could be a good way--
-It'd be a great in.

146
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,640 
Especially something that's creative
and she does something creative as well.

147
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,240 
Cai's art is about the whole
blow-in culture with Byron.

148
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,360 
I can understand where he's coming from.

149
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,840 
The locals can make it so awkward
and make people feel so unwelcome.

150
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,360 
And I would hate for Sarah
to have that feeling.

151
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,160 
I didn't get to speak to her
much at the Johansen event.

152
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,400 
Yeah, 'cause we were hanging out there
and I didn't really get to see you guys.

153
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,640 
The whole thing was…

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,480 
I wanted her to go out
and make friends and talk to people.

155
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,000 
Be a bit more comfortable.

156
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,360 
Exactly. And just get to know people here.

157
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,560 
So she's got a friendship circle here.

158
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,800 
-Yeah.
-For sure.

159
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,080 
-Hey.
-Hey, gorgie bum!

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240 
-Hey, cutie. How are you?
-How are you?

161
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,800 
-What are you having?
-Green smoothie.

162
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,400 
-I ordered you an almond latte.
-Thank God.

163
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,200 
-Thank you, sweetie.
-Only the best for my boo.

164
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,120 
Thanks, darl.

165
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,840 
I hear you're gonna perform
at Cai's exhibition.

166
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,160 
-You think it's gonna be good?
-It's gonna be great.

167
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,720 
-Okay.
-It's gonna be interesting.

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,200 
-Why? I feel like you know something.
-Well…

169
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,960 
-You know the whole Jade thing? Yeah.
-Yeah.

170
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,200 
-The followers.
-Yeah.

171
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,480 
We have the software,
and we generate this report

172
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,440 
and I looked at his audience
and it's not good.

173
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,000 
He's going out to market
with his 1,2 million

174
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,240 
and 550,000 of that is from Turkey.

175
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,840 
Another 100,000 of that's from Iran--

176
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,840 
He doesn't just have
a big audience from Turkey?

177
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,240 
It's unlikely.

178
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,000 
Jade claims to be
the most followed man in Australia.

179
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080 
And with that comes
a lot of responsibility.

180
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,520 
You need to have a real audience.

181
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,640 
And if you don't,
you need to be called out.

182
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,360 
I have to have a conversation with him.
I don't know how he's going to take it.

183
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,480 
I feel bad for him, but at same time,
I think, "Fuck you!"

184
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,440 
"Fuck you"?

185
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,800 
Are you gonna bring it up at Cai's?

186
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,840 
-Yeah.
-My God.

187
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,840 
What's going on with Nathan?
I have been dying to find out.

188
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,200 
I haven't seen him since the launch.

189
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,960 
Really? But you must've like…

190
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,720 
-heard from him?
-No.

191
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,320 
That is so weird to me.

192
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,000 
I'm just really confused about Nathan

193
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,400 
because after spending
one-on-one time with him,

194
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,200 
I just don't understand
why he's acting really weird.

195
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,600 
And then do you know what?

196
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,720 
I was at the beach hanging out with Elias.

197
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,360 
-We were chatting.
-Right.

198
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,880 
I asked him about the Nathan thing

199
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,600 
and he confirmed, he is indeed a fuckboy.

200
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,080 
So, do you think he's a player then?

201
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,240 
-I mean, he doesn't really hide that.
-Do you think he's a fuckboy?

202
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000 
Yeah, you're pretty bang-on.

203
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,080 
I thought Nathan and I had a connection,

204
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,920 
but it looks like I was wrong.

205
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,240 
So, I don't know how
this is gonna go down when I see him.

206
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,520 
-Is that Elias?
-No. Hannah.

207
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,720 
No. Hang on. Hannah.

208
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,440 
How is the handmaid?

209
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,800 
No.

210
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,360 
-What'd she say?
-"Hey, beautiful girl."

211
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,800 
"Considering we may have started off
in not the most perfect light,

212
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,040 
I thought it would be nice
to have a healing,

213
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,680 
girly, nourishing
get-together to creative sharing."

214
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,600 
"What are your thoughts? Love, Hannah."

215
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,400 
-I don't get it.
-You have beef with her?

216
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560 
No, I didn't think I did.

217
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,520 
What should I say? Should I do it?

218
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,680 
It's kind of odd
getting a text from Hannah,

219
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,880 
but I really wanna go to Cai's exhibition
feeling like I have some girlfriends.

220
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,600 
-Do you want to do it?
-May as well.

221
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,960 
Yeah. I'll do it.

222
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,440 
-You should.
-Yeah.

223
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,400 
I love spending time in nature.

224
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,880 
Just breathing in the oxygen-enriched air.

225
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,400 
Nathan and I are super close.
We're like soul brother and soul sister.

226
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,000 
We do a lot of things together,
and we have each other's backs.

227
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,280 
-It's good to get out of the house.
-Yeah.

228
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,760 
<i>I know that Nathan and Sarah</i>
<i>have been hanging out with each other.</i>

229
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,920 
<i>I wanted to have a chat with him</i>
<i>and find out how he's doing.</i>

230
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,720 
What did you think of the Johansen launch?

231
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800 
It was good.

232
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,840 
-Jess is obviously super talented.
-Yeah.

233
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680 
-It was really nice.
-I love her clothes.

234
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,600 
Yeah.

235
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,560 
So, I actually
wanna address something with you.

236
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,960 
So, when I was talking to Sarah…

237
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320 
…she felt that you were
super cold at the party.

238
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,120 
I wasn't being cold. I wasn't giving her
maybe the attention that she wanted.

239
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,960 
I was just trying to let her do her thing.

240
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,040 
At the end of the day,
are you even interested in Sarah?

241
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,920 
She's really talented as a musician.

242
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160 
So, maybe I was a little bit starstruck

243
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,960 
when she was playing uke on the beach.

244
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,960 
I'm only telling you this
because I love you.

245
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,280 
Someone's going around
and talking shit about you

246
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,960 
and calling you a fuckboy.

247
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,440 
And I have a feeling
it's gotten back to Sarah.

248
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,000 
I just thought that was incredibly rude.

249
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,960 
I really don't appreciate that,
to be honest. I hate that shit.

250
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,040 
I really like Sarah

251
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,640 
and I don't want her to get
the wrong impression,

252
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,640 
because that couldn't be
any further from the truth for me.

253
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,640 
I just wanted you to know.

254
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,680 
Yeah, well,
maybe I'm gonna ask her about that.

255
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720 
From what I've experienced thus far,

256
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,680 
I don't think
Sarah's a good match for Nathan at all.

257
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880 
And I just feel like Nathan
can do so much better than Sarah.

258
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,680 
I think you should approach her about it.

259
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760 
Yeah.

260
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,400 
Yeah.

261
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,680 
Time to watch Nathan get bogged.

262
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760 
Let's see Nathan get bogged.

263
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480 
It's kind of stressing me out
that Sarah thinks that I'm a fuckboy.

264
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,640 
But it's always good
to go down to the beach

265
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,600 
and have a bit of time with the boys.

266
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,080 
Because these guys
are like my closest friends.

267
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,160 
I'm not trying to peer pressure you
into going faster.

268
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,920 
It's just like, maybe turn the car on.
That'd be nice.

269
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,400 
Are you guys excited for the show?

270
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,560 
Yeah. I'm psyched, man.

271
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,160 
-I'm pumped.
-That's sick.

272
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,280 
I printed some stuff
on fabric and everything.

273
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,520 
So, it'll look really cool.

274
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,400 
And it's in a little bit of a shed.

275
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,200 
But, I've invited quite a lot of people.

276
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,200 
-Sick.
-Yeah. Up in the hills.

277
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,200 
-Yeah.
-Amazing.

278
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,400 
And you've also organized the musical
performance for the night, yeah?

279
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,200 
Yeah. We heard about this yesterday.

280
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,480 
So, what happened was,

281
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,320 
Sarah played the ukulele
and sung to me on the beach.

282
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,280 
And we went on this little date
or whatever you wanna call it.

283
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,040 
-And--
-I think it's called a date.

284
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,640 
-Right--
-Hang on a second.

285
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,400 
-Is that your Sarah?
-Not my Sarah, it's <i>the </i>Sarah.

286
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,880 
Actually bumped into Sarah
yesterday on the beach after a wave.

287
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,800 
-Really?
-Yeah.

288
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,640 
You've both been
on beach dates with Sarah?

289
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,200 
I didn't go on a beach date.

290
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680 
Did she have a ukulele with her?

291
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,320 
She didn't have a ukulele.

292
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,960 
She had a lollipop and a…

293
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,760 
-She had a violin.
-A hydro flask.

294
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,000 
Sounds like a date to me.

295
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,360 
I heard something the other day.

296
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,000 
They all told me
that someone called me a fuckboy.

297
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,920 
Yeah.

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240 
-Do you think--
-Did you do anything fuckboy related?

299
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,280 
Is there an essence that you could be?

300
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,960 
You know me…

301
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,680 
I've been just hanging out with you guys.

302
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,160 
Someone's kind of planted
this seed in Sarah's head

303
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600 
and that's why she's going around
asking people if I'm a fuckboy.

304
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,120 
The only people
that really know me is the boys.

305
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,240 
And they would never
say anything like that.

306
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,960 
I don't know how this has happened.

307
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,560 
I hate being called a fuckboy.

308
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,640 
Because it's just like, in my opinion,
a fuckboy is someone with no depth

309
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,240 
and they are literally just out there
to go and fornicate, basically.

310
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,200 
If you guys wanna call me a fuckboy
just get it over and done with now.

311
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,240 
Since I've known Nathan…
Obviously, we'd go out and party a bit.

312
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,280 
The priority of the night for him

313
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,800 
definitely seems to revolve
around sleeping with a girl.

314
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,080 
That is the very essence
of a fuckboy, right?

315
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,160 
Yeah. Let's stop talking about that stuff.
Let's go surfing.

316
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,560 
I'm not too sure about Sarah,
considering she's good friends with Alex.

317
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,000 
But I don't know
if she has any girlfriends in Byron.

318
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,240 
-Hi.
-Hello.

319
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,280 
How are you?

320
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,240 
This is so cute.

321
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,080 
So, I'm gonna meet up with her
and see if I misjudged her.

322
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,240 
Welcome to my little healing magic carpet.

323
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,920 
I'm finding it really strange
that Hannah wanted to meet up with me.

324
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,600 
I'm having a hard time fitting in here
and perhaps she is just trying to help me.

325
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,800 
I just thought I would bring you here
just to clear the air and start off

326
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,760 
in a more positive note after that

327
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,920 
ridiculously stupid
<i>Handmaid's Tale</i> comment.

328
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,480 
I don't like to dwell on things.

329
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,480 
I like to heal things
and move forward and, you know…

330
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,240 
Okay, good.
I'm glad that you invited me here.

331
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,560 
'Cause I haven't got to spend any time

332
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,200 
-with any girls in town since I got here.
-Yeah.

333
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,680 
It's nice to get
to hang out and get to know each other.

334
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,120 
I know.

335
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000 
You're a Byron local.
You seem to know everyone.

336
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,560 
What can you tell me about the rest
of the people that were at your party?

337
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,200 
Well, I know you've been
hanging out with Nathan.

338
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,760 
-Yeah.
-He's a ball of energy.

339
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,160 
Yeah. He seems like a party boy.

340
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,560 
He's a party boy, you know.
It's just who he is.

341
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600 
Elle lives with him.

342
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680 
What's she like?

343
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,920 
'Cause she was really hard to read.
I can't…

344
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,920 
-She is hard to read, though.
-Yeah.

345
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,080 
She's a strong woman.

346
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,400 
I feel like Hannah's confirming
everything I had already suspected.

347
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,400 
Let's do a tarot reading.

348
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,760 
Okay. Do it? Start?

349
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,040 
-Go.
-Okay. All right.

350
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,520 
I'm really nervous. Okay.

351
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,000 
Two of Wands.

352
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,480 
It says, "Hope for a balanced
future made manifest.

353
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,960 
The labor of our hard work
come to fruition."

354
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,920 
-That was good.
-Yes!

355
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,360 
-Pick another?
-All right. Here we go.

356
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,880 
Queen of Pentacles.

357
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,200 
Interesting, 'cause she's pretty much
in the same kind of color tones.

358
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,800 
I know. And she's got her boob out.

359
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,520 
I'm just vibing with her.

360
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,000 
She's my kinda girl.

361
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,000 
Hanging out with Hannah,
I have definitely softened to her.

362
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,680 
I respect Hannah for reaching out to me
and wanting to spend some time with me.

363
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,240 
And I feel good
that I'm going to Cai's exhibition

364
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,640 
with a little bit of support.

365
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,680 
I'm so glad that we got to do this.

366
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,200 
I feel so much better now.

367
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,200 
-So, thank you so much.
-I'm really glad too.

368
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,360 
We've broken through.

369
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,840 
That makes you my first Byron girlfriend.

370
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,960 
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

371
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,240 
I wanna get a photo.

372
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,120 
-I wanna get a selfie quickly.
-Okay.

373
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,200 
All right. Gotta document this shit.

374
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,760 
Man, it's so cool. Unsuspecting
characters all hanging out together.

375
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,240 
It's a good crew, man.

376
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,240 
-It's a weird mix of us.
-Yeah. I love it.

377
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,160 
I think that a lot of people
are attracted to Byron,

378
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,600 
not just from like one specific thing.

379
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,120 
I think there's so many different elements
that are amazing about this place.

380
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,680 
If you're a good person,
doesn't matter where you're from.

381
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,360 
Before you came here it was a whole
different world you were living in.

382
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,120 
And, you know, the person you are now,

383
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,400 
how is that sort of different from before?

384
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,560 
It's been a really, really tough,
difficult, turbulent journey, man.

385
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,040 
Do you mind if I ask what happened?

386
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,960 
One of my close friends who passed away…

387
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,720 
A couple of my friends
wanted to do a psychedelic trip

388
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,120 
with some psilocybin mushrooms.

389
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,960 
Things didn't go as planned. And…

390
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,360 
One of my close friends
ended up falling off the balcony.

391
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,640 
And…

392
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080 
Yeah. It's…

393
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,080 
Man.

394
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,600 
Yeah, man. It's…

395
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,440 
I can't even begin to comprehend
how that must have felt.

396
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,640 
Man. Yeah.

397
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,600 
Yeah. It kind of switched this level
of compassion or empathy in me,

398
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,040 
which allows me to help
so many other people.

399
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,880 
If that traumatic experience that you
went under has brought you to here,

400
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,920 
I'm thankful that your journey has,
you know, brought you to this place.

401
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,640 
<i>Before I was in Byron,</i>
<i>I was in the corporate world.</i>

402
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,480 
<i>It didn't feel authentic.</i>
<i>It didn't feel like it was me.</i>

403
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,520 
<i>So, when I meet someone like Cai,</i>
<i>I feel very much at home.</i>

404
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,520 
I think it's good for us, as men,

405
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,440 
to be a bit more open and…
Talking about this stuff.

406
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,440 
Yeah.

407
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,520 
The conversation with Simba,
it was quite intimate, you know.

408
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,280 
And that's a hard thing
to find in a new person.

409
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,680 
This community and this area,

410
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,920 
that's where I grab
all my inspiration from.

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,360 
And that's what I'm trying
to show at my exhibition.

412
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,880 
Tonight's Cai's exhibition.

413
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,480 
I'm hoping
I don't derail the entire night.

414
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,560 
But there's questions
about Jade's Instagram

415
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,200 
that need to be answered.

416
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,240 
No one else is gonna ask him.

417
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,640 
Hello, beautiful.

418
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,920 
Cai!

419
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,520 
How are you?

420
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,160 
-Good. Thank you. How are you?
-Thanks for coming.

421
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,320 
Good to see you.

422
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,280 
Sarah is a creative,

423
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,840 
a lot of my friends and me are creatives,
and we're going to be at this exhibition.

424
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,800 
It's a great way for her
to sort of feel a bit more included.

425
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,160 
-You ready?
-I'm ready.

426
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,160 
Welcome. Think you're the first person
to actually see it.

427
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,160 
-I love this.
-What do you think?

428
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,440 
I'm obsessed with everything about this.

429
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,880 
Yeah?

430
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,080 
The fabric's a new style
that I chose to do.

431
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,640 
It's just 'cause it was,
I guess, cheaper to make.

432
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,520 
But I really wanted that photo
big in the middle.

433
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,760 
This is unreal.

434
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,960 
So, are you nervous?

435
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,640 
-Should I be?
-No. Not at all.

436
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,280 
All the people who are coming are friends
and family and they're all good people.

437
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,200 
-Okay.
-But then, there's you know…

438
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,040 
-I'm grateful you invited me to perform.
-Yeah!

439
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,560 
Byron Bay is well renowned for
creative types coming together.

440
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,800 
So, it's probably going to be a great
opportunity to show people who I am.

441
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,200 
So, this musical number that you're doing…

442
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,840 
-Yeah?
-What's it about?

443
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,440 
You know when you feel
real kind of conflicted thoughts?

444
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,720 
The lyrics to my song are

445
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,920 
about feeling like an outsider in Byron.

446
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,720 
I felt like I'm not really supposed to be

447
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,280 
here and I felt really out of place.

448
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,680 
-Yeah. Actually, let me hear this song.
-Sure.

449
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,480 
<i>I've been staring at the dirty spot</i>

450
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,800 
<i>That taints my bedroom wall</i>
<i>For what feels like a year</i>

451
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,440 
<i>It's been a minute since I left this room</i>

452
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,600 
<i>And longer since I held on tight</i>
<i>To anything that don't give me the blues</i>

453
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,440 
<i>They're going on around here…</i>

454
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,760 
Sarah was going to find out
the truth about Nathan sooner or later.

455
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,840 
I'm keen to see how she interacts
with Nathan tonight

456
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,600 
and how that kind of bubbles up
and unfolds.

457
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,160 
<i>So take the high road with the bumps</i>
<i>Yeah, well, I guess I paid the price</i>

458
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,240 
<i>Sold my life and soul for fame</i>
<i>I said it once, I say it twice</i>

459
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,600 
<i>I don't belong here…</i>

460
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,200 
I definitely do want to speak
to Alex tonight, because I feel like

461
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,440 
he has a problem.

462
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,080 
And I don't understand
why he's doing this.

463
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,440 
<i>I've been staring at the dirty spot</i>

464
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,520 
<i>That taints my bedroom wall</i>
<i>For what feels like a year…</i>

465
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,920 
Tonight, I'm just gonna ask Sarah about
the rumors that have been going around

466
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,320 
about me being a fuckboy.
And try and get to the bottom of it.

467
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000 
I can't let this one go.

468
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,560 
<i>And then I met you and you scare me</i>

469
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,640 
<i>'Cause the only souls I met here</i>
<i>In this strange town, they're all liars</i>

470
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400 
<i>But you said you'd stick around</i>

471
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,800 
<i>And I believe you</i>

472
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,280 
<i>I really do</i>

473
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,560 
<i>We're all liars around here</i>

474
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,560 
<i>I'm home</i>

475
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,320 
<i>And we're all liars around here</i>

476
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,920 
-Yeah!
-Yeah, girl!

477
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,840 
That was amazing.

478
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,200 
All right. How's everyone doing?

479
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,920 
Yeah? You're good?

480
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,720 
I really want to say thank you so much.

481
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,240 
Friends, family, new friends, old friends,
thank you so much for coming.

482
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,000 
I want to explain a bit about this
collection of work that I've put together.

483
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,520 
So, I've shot these over the past,
I guess, maybe year.

484
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,960 
The main focus from all the images
are different emotions.

485
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,440 
That feeling of sort of euphoria
with this area.

486
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,800 
It really works with the sort of
"blow-in" culture and that stuff.

487
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,760 
There's a bit of that in here and there's
a bit of those blow-ins here as well.

488
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,840 
We love them, you know?

489
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,800 
We are the two biggest blow-ins.
We are the blow-ins.

490
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,040 
Fucking love all of you new friends.

491
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,240 
And I fucking love all of you guys
as well.

492
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,720 
Cheers, Cai.

493
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,280 
All right. Now go drink the free alcohol.

494
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,480 
-There he is!
-Stay away from me!

495
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,320 
-How's it going?
-Hi!

496
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,880 
That was so beautiful.

497
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,160 
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

498
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,320 
-Wanna come for a walk?
-Sure.

499
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,840 
Do I… I'll leave that there. That's fine.

500
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,480 
We're in the middle of nowhere.

501
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,520 
I think after hearing Sarah sing,
it just struck a chord.

502
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,320 
I think she's a really special soul.

503
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,280 
-You wrote that song this week?
-Yeah.

504
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,840 
Right. It was actually sick.

505
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,440 
-Thank you.
-Your stage presence… Yeah.

506
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,920 
-Just crazy.
-Thank you.

507
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,920 
-I feel like--
-Your sass really comes out.

508
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,240 
It would have been better
if I wasn't freezing.

509
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,600 
-Want my jacket?
-Little bit.

510
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,080 
-No. Then you'll be freezing.
-I'm not cold.

511
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,240 
Look. Now they're just having a chat
and it's like…

512
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,360 
Are you sure?
I feel really bad. Don't do that.

513
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440 
-I don't get cold that easy.
-I'll take it.

514
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,480 
-You don't want to be into that.
-It's cool.

515
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,760 
Typical Elias.

516
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,120 
Straight after
she finishes playing her song,

517
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,160 
he swoops in, grabs her,
he even throws his coat over her.

518
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,480 
He's like… Man…

519
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,360 
Oh, my God. This is really warm.

520
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,120 
I'm gonna actually "put it on," put it on.

521
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,120 
This is like a biker jacket.

522
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,640 
-It's my riding jacket.
-'Cause you ride motorcycles.

523
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,680 
This is good. You're cold now, aren't you?

524
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,280 
You're pretending like you aren't.

525
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,680 
Am I cold?

526
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,080 
No, but you… Oh, my God!

527
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,000 
Last time I saw you,
when you came out to surf,

528
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,040 
you said we should catch up again.
We should.

529
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,840 
-Okay. Let's do it.
-Yeah.

530
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,640 
Oysters and champagne?

531
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,040 
Oysters and champagne! You read my mind.

532
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,640 
I'd actually really love that.

533
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,680 
-That'd be so much fun.
-Yeah. That'd be cool. Let's do it.

534
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,880 
Elias is cool. He's sure of himself.

535
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,520 
And he's quite supportive.

536
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,960 
-Go back in? Let's do it.
-Yeah!

537
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,640 
<i>It feels really good to talk to him.</i>

538
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,800 
I know I love your work.

539
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,120 
It means so much
to have nana and pop here.

540
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,480 
My sister. My friends and family.

541
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,720 
They're all my biggest fans

542
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,440 
and it's so great to see everyone
enjoying themselves and getting on.

543
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,720 
What speaks to you, here?

544
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,200 
This smorgasbord of bodies.

545
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,080 
Did you say "smorgasbord of bodies"?

546
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,600 
Fuck. What a Saturday night.

547
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,720 
In a town full of posers,

548
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,000 
it's nice to see someone
with some real creativity.

549
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,720 
Cai is exactly the type of person
that I came to Byron to find.

550
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,240 
I put my money where my mouth is.
So, yeah, I'm gonna buy some of Cai's art.

551
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,880 
Is this what you would…
Is this your style?

552
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,720 
I love the roller girl

553
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,040 
and I love the other print
which has the sheets.

554
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,440 
I'd love to have both of them
up on my walls.

555
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,880 
It shows the anxiety side,
but also the freedom side.

556
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,400 
I think you're on point.

557
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,400 
I'm just hearing about
he's talking about you.

558
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,800 
-You're hearing about what?
-Alex.

559
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,320 
Alex has come in and talked shit
about my new friends.

560
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,520 
Alex was slagging off the Johansen event

561
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,400 
and I'm not gonna stand for that.

562
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,920 
In your opinion, when you heard him,
was it coming from a mean place,

563
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,840 
or was it actually like…
It was mean and spiteful or nasty?

564
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,600 
I think he was being a bit mean.

565
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,560 
It was.

566
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,120 
So, where's Alex?

567
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,560 
Come here.

568
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,080 
Hey, Alex. Can we have a chat with you?

569
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,600 
-Sure.
-Let's have a chat.

570
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,960 
Let's go have a chat with Alex.

571
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,640 
-Hey.
-Hey!

572
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,200 
We just wanted to
privately have a chat with you.

573
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,120 
I hear you're going around
saying stuff about--

574
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,680 
-Jess's event.
-Jess's event.

575
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,760 
What did I say at Jess's event?

576
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,200 
You were being rude to her.
People heard you.

577
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,720 
-During the show.
-Like made a nasty comment.

578
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,320 
You were like,
"She spent six years designing this?"

579
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,240 
Just talking shit.

580
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,000 
It was a joke. She said,
"I've been designing this for six years."

581
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080 
I don't know fashion,

582
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,760 
so, I said, "Does it take six years
to design something?"

583
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,280 
Honestly, I have no idea
what Alex's problem is.

584
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,840 
It just wasn't the night for anyone
to try and say shit to me.

585
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,240 
Do you have a problem with me?

586
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,520 
I do have an issue with you.

587
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,760 
When I first came across you,
I was fascinated with you.

588
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,680 
I still am fascinated with you.

589
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,640 
You've built this audience
and your profile is full-on.

590
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,480 
But one thing that kind of

591
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,400 
rattled me… I was trying
to work out how you did it.

592
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,800 
I knew the whole Kim Kardashian thing
and all that jazz.

593
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,600 
But I ran your account through
our software at the office.

594
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,160 
When it comes up with your audience
it says that

595
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,120 
half your audience is from Turkey

596
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,400 
and that you've got more followers in Iran
than you do in Australia.

597
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,440 
If you'd done your research
into me properly,

598
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,400 
you'd realize I've traveled
the whole world

599
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,000 
and I've worked my fucking ass off
to get to where I am.

600
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,880 
So, if you're gonna go as a talent manager
and question me and my authenticity,

601
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,800 
sitting here as a talent manager,
with talent, you're a fucking joke.

602
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,360 
Now let's get into your business.

603
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440 
So, you're a "talent manager," yeah?

604
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,600 
Who do you "manage"?

605
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,960 
I've managed all different kinds
of YouTuber credits.

606
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,480 
All kinds of YouTuber credits?
What have they done?

607
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,840 
Give me some examples.

608
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,120 
They're not your size
or have a million audience.

609
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,800 
That's why you don't understand
anyone of my size.

610
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,240 
'Cause you've never managed
anyone of my size.

611
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,480 
You obviously don't have that much talent.
You obviously don't have that much time.

612
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,120 
And that's why you're here
trying to create this drama.

613
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,080 
You're an absolute fucking disgrace.

614
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,320 
Jade's response
is really emotional and aggressive.

615
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,120 
I think there's a bit of guilt there,
but I'm not gonna back down.

616
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,400 
My question stands.

617
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,560 
Who do you manage here?

618
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,600 
-No one.
-You don't manage anyone here?

619
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,240 
Then what are you doing here?

620
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,440 
Why are you yelling at him?

621
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,640 
Have a go. You for real?

622
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,240 
I came here to find talent.
That's why I looked into you.

623
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,840 
You tried to manage me
so many times, Alex.

624
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,040 
-I don't think that's true.
-You don't "think" that's true?

625
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,840 
-Maybe five years ago.
-That's not true?

626
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,000 
So, you're admitting it?

627
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,520 
-Maybe five years ago.
-You admit it?

628
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,880 
Maybe five years ago.

629
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,760 
You tried to gain me as talent,
I said no to you,

630
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,080 
and you're coming here and saying that
my "audience is from Turkey."

631
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,280 
You tried to manage me so many times
and I said no to you,

632
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,400 
and now have a go.

633
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,680 
Look at you! You look, here,
as a talent manager,

634
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,560 
absolutely fucking pathetic.

635
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,560 
Pathetic.

636
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,520 
See you, Jade.

637
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,680 
Give me another drink.
He's a fucking joke.

638
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,680 
Can I have another wine? Thank you.

639
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,000 
-Is this white wine?
-Yes.

640
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,720 
Are you for real? What the fuck?

641
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,120 
Alex is coming for my business right now.

642
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,760 
It feels very personal.

643
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,040 
He's trying to discredit me and
my business that I worked very hard for,

644
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,960 
for a very long fucking time.
So, it's not on.

645
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,840 
-How are you doing, Sarah?
-Good. How are you?

646
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,520 
I haven't seen you all night.

647
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,480 
Man, I just… I just want to
find out what the goal is here.

648
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,720 
If someone's planted this seed,
it's someone that has no idea who I am

649
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,600 
and doesn't know me from a bar of soap.

650
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,200 
Or it's one of my close mates.

651
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,240 
Was it you that asked, "am I a fuckboy?"

652
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,520 
Or was it someone that planted
that seed in your head?

653
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,720 
It was…

654
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,960 
Elias.

655
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,480 
-You're full witch doctor on me?
-Yeah.

656
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,720 
What did Elias say to you?

657
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,960 
It was… The conversation
of "Nathan" got brought up.

658
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,640 
-Yeah.
-And…

659
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,640 
He basically just said,
"If you're worried that

660
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,880 
Nathan is a fuckboy,

661
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,840 
you're right."

662
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,520 
And that you're…

663
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,160 
not really a person of substance.

664
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,360 
That's actually pretty ruthless.

665
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,719 
Elias strikes me as a caring person

666
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,000 
but Nathan's reaction to Elias'
comments about him

667
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,520 
made me feel awful.

668
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,280 
I think I've got him all wrong.

669
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,719 
That burns…

670
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,600 
hard when, I guess…

671
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,480 
it comes from one of your friends.

672
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:46,280 
Turns out Elias is the person
that really dug the knife in here.

673
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,840 
And that fucking hurts.

674
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,600 
I don't have a bruised
enough ego to be like,

675
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,520 
"No. I never want to talk to you again."

676
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600 
It's all good. Honestly, it's sweet.

677
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,360 
And I appreciate everything
you said as well, 'cause it means a lot.

678
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,320 
He's tried to manage me so many times.

679
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,920 
I cannot control my emotions at all
when someone comes for me.

680
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200 
And my business.

681
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,360 
And something that I worked so hard for.

682
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,680 
-'Cause he's a talent manager.
-He's a talent manager, right?

683
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,560 
He sent so many emails out
to try and get me, to manage me

684
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,520 
and I declined him.

685
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,440 
But the thing is…
If the question was here,

686
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,400 
the response was like up here.

687
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,800 
And then him going,
"You tried so hard to manage me."

688
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,840 
I don't really think
I ever did, to be honest.

689
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,720 
Now he wants to go in there and say,

690
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,480 
"Your followers are from Turkey."

691
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,080 
I've traveled to Turkey…
I've traveled the whole world.

692
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,160 
-He's tried to be your manager--
-Yeah. So many times.

693
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,960 
You were right to follow your gut.

694
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,960 
-100%.
-And not let him manage you.

695
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,160 
Imagine if I said yes to him. Oh, my God!

696
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,800 
-He'd be talking shit about you.
-Oh, my God. Literally.

697
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,320 
I have literally traveled
around the whole world.

698
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,800 
Where the fuck…
I'll show him my Instagram right now.

699
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,240 
Literally. I will go in there and show him
my Instagram right now.

700
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,120 
-Turn around to the clown.
-Do it.

701
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,080 
And turn around and say,
"What the fuck is your problem?"

702
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,040 
He didn't deny the audience
was from Turkey.

703
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,440 
As I said, it's just a question, mate.

704
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,560 
Where did the audience come from?
And he just went…

705
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,840 
Just so you know,
something is about to happen.

706
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,800 
With?

707
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,400 
-There you are!
-Hey!
