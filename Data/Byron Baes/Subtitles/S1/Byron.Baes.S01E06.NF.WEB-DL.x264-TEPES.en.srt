1
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,120 
-What did Nathan say?
-That you said I was fake.

2
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,040 
Nathan would never say that.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,960 
-He did.
-It's not true.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,440 
Nathan's not a liar.

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,800 
But he did say it.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040 
I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,080 
I don't care who told you what,
but right now this is Elle's event--

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,720 
You can't out-grieve the widow.
You're more upset than Elle.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,160 
No. I'm upset because I don't want
this to take away from Elle's event.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800 
Just leave.

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,000 
I've had enough.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,200 
-I think at the end of the day--
-Let's go.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,960 
I'm sick of this shit.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,400 
-Can I just say something?
-Where's Nathan?

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,040 
Nathan's coming here.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,720 
I need to talk to Nathan.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,560 
I always get in the middle
of some situations.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,320 
I mean, I'm friends with everyone.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,920 
I'm friends with Nathan.
I'm friends with Elle.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720 
Whatever Elle's issue is,
she needs to sort it out

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,640 
so everyone can move on.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,840 
-Dude.
-What?

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,960 
You've been saying
that I called Sarah fake.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,120 
She felt like
she's not been included into--

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,480 
-I don't give a fuck how she feels.
-Listen to me.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,240 
No. I'm gonna tell you right now.
She said that you said specifically.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,880 
I literally came in
with the best intentions

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,280 
and I'm being made to feel like I'm crazy.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,560 
-Everyone's like, "He said this--"
-You're not crazy.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,440 
It doesn't make sense
why Nathan would say that.

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,440 
If it's not true.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,800 
Hannah also said it.

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,760 
It's the same thing.
It's that Elle is saying something.

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,360 
There's a fight happening there now.

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,880 
-How she can't be trusted--
-Fucking hell.

36
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,560 
I think I need to leave.

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,040 
Yeah. I need to leave.

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,320 
-I'm gonna take this and go.
-Okay.

39
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,640 
She poured her heart out
and said that all of these people

40
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,400 
have been talking about her.
She doesn't feel liked.

41
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,600 
I said, "I have to agree."

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,200 
Then she goes, "Was it Elle?"

43
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,039 
You have said stuff about her.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,320 
I've said specifically,
"I still don't know who she is."

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,640 
I never said she's fake.

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,680 
-Okay. But get this.
-Get me.

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,120 
I feel like Sarah is driving
a wedge between Nathan and I.

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,080 
And to be honest with you,

49
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,400 
it hurts my heart a bit.

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,360 
What's going on? Talk to me. Come here.

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,920 
I feel like I should leave.

52
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,720 
I don't wanna cause a bigger scene
than what's already happened.

53
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,440 
I wanted to talk to Elle
because I've been hearing so much shit.

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,880 
It's the first chance
I got to talk to Elle.

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240 
She flat-out denied it.

56
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,200 
Now I feel super gaslit
and super blindsided.

57
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,600 
I feel bad for Sarah

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,320 
just 'cause she's not done
anything wrong to anyone

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,280 
and people are giving her a tough go.

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,080 
People have judged you
for the way that they perceive you

61
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,760 
and that's why I'm here to back you up.

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,600 
My whole goal here
is to make you feel welcome.

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,240 
And you are very welcome here.

64
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,280 
I think it's nice that he came out
to make sure that I was okay,

65
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,720 
but Elle was incredibly convincing

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,560 
and it's starting to make me doubt Nathan.

67
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,000 
So I'm feeling, honestly, awful.

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,200 
So I've said what I need to say
and I'm just done now.

69
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,000 
I respect your decision.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,960 
-I wish you would stay.
-Sorry.

71
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,200 
I got the door.

72
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,240 
When I moved to Byron, I thought
I was gonna make new friends.

73
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,920 
I realize more than ever
how isolated I am,

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,720 
in that I don't have solid friendships
with most of these people here.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,320 
And I feel like nothing I do
would be good enough for them.

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,160 
At Elle's fundraiser yesterday,

77
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,240 
Jade and I decided we should
cut the crap, have a conversation,

78
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160 
see if we could move on with our lives.

79
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,200 
Ever since Cai's exhibition,

80
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,120 
things between Jade and I
have been awkward.

81
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,520 
I am accusing him
of buying fake followers,

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,320 
and every party I see him at,
he is throwing daggers my way.

83
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,360 
It's a small industry
and it's bad for my business.

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,080 
I'm nervous about meeting with Alex
because I don't trust Alex.

85
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640 
Hello?

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,120 
-Hey.
-How are you?

87
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,080 
You bought vodka.

88
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,760 
This is kind of like the peace offering.

89
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,120 
I've invited him into my home

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,880 
and I just don't know
which way this is gonna go.

91
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,000 
I was a bit nervous, with you coming here,

92
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,600 
because I just really don't know
what's gonna come out of your mouth.

93
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,320 
The reason I came up to you and said,
"Do you wanna chat one-on-one?"

94
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,200 
is I wanted to have
a conversation away from everyone.

95
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,120 
Just to see if we can just talk, I guess.

96
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,440 
Obviously,
at Cai's exhibition I upset you.

97
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,680 
And I feel like you wanted blood.
Like you were out to--

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,480 
I was ready to stab you to the neck.
I was ready to go.

99
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,840 
You should take your talent to Turkey,

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,560 
get 1,2 million followers from Turkey
so they can do what I've done.

101
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,920 
You look here, as a talent manager,
absolutely fucking pathetic. Pathetic.

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,960 
You were trying to discredit my work
that I have worked so fucking hard for.

103
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,200 
For ten years now, I've had my phone
every single second of my life,

104
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,200 
doing everything
for my fans and my followers.

105
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,800 
I took it as a personal attack
and I lost it because it hit me hard.

106
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,360 
I don't think Alex could ever understand
what Instagram is to me.

107
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,640 
My followers are my best friends.

108
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,600 
These people give me joy.
These people make me happy.

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,880 
You think you're the only person
trying to discredit my Instagram?

110
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,920 
No. I've had enough of it.
I won't to put up with it anymore.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,800 
My whole life, people have done
what you've done to me

112
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,200 
at Cai's art exhibition.

113
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,760 
I come from a small country town.

114
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,360 
All the time, people would
turn around and push me down

115
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,600 
because I'm different. Because I am gay.

116
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,600 
I didn't have any friends.

117
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240 
Weirdly, you and I
are the same in a lot of ways.

118
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,320 
You know, going to the school,
I was like the fat, pimply, redheaded kid.

119
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,160 
I look at the people around here

120
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,240 
and instantly I'm like,
"I don't really fit in here."

121
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,600 
I'll be honest,
my natural defensive mechanism

122
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,520 
when I'm uncomfortable is to kind of

123
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,480 
go on the offensive and poke fun at things
because that's my sense of humor.

124
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,640 
It's like escargot, darl.
I'm a really acquired taste.

125
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,440 
Pardon?

126
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,000 
I don't know what escargot is.

127
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000 
-Snails.
-Okay.

128
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,040 
He has a vocabulary
that is a lot bigger than mine.

129
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,520 
And he 100% would have went to Year 12.

130
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,880 
Wait.

131
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,640 
This is my white flag.

132
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,600 
-It's a tissue but that's the white flag.
-Okay.

133
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,080 
I'm sure we can find some common ground.

134
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,440 
Well, I hope so. Yeah.

135
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,400 
After listening to him, I'm starting
to understand him a little bit better.

136
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,000 
There is a little bit of humanity there.

137
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,560 
But this is not peace, this is a truce.

138
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,280 
And if Alex breaks the truce,
get ready for round two.

139
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,960 
So, look, apology's out of the way…

140
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,640 
-There we go.
-Just get smashed?

141
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,200 
-No.
-Why not?

142
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,320 
-I do not wanna get smashed.
-I do.

143
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,080 
-What color are you doing?
-I don't know. What do you reckon?

144
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,520 
-Pink. Do pink.
-Pink? Match your jacket?

145
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,520 
-Yep. I reckon.
-We can do that.

146
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,520 
I think with Nathan,
I feel sorry for the poor guy

147
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,840 
after that little confrontation
at Elle's fundraiser.

148
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,080 
Hello.

149
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,360 
Look who it is.

150
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,360 
How are you? Good?

151
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,840 
-Hello.
-Hello.

152
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,120 
How are things?

153
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,640 
-Speak of the devil.
-Good.

154
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,840 
-So, Elle's fundraiser?
-Yeah.

155
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,360 
-Haven't seen you since then.
-Yeah.

156
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,400 
All I wanna do is just protect Sarah.

157
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,200 
I really just want everyone,
particularly the girls,

158
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,840 
to just see who she really is.

159
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,600 
She's not fake
and she's not hiding behind anything.

160
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,720 
She's just a bit scared at the moment.

161
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,919 
Look, Sarah likes to come across
as a very strong, independent woman

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,919 
-that doesn't give a fuck.
-Yeah.

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,360 
But, at the end of the day, she does care.

164
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,799 
When she goes home, she gets rattled
about what people think of her,

165
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,800 
what people say about her.

166
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,720 
She feels like she gets judged
before people get to know her.

167
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,160 
I was like, "I hate it as well."

168
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,240 
With Sarah,
I think you need to be careful.

169
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,240 
We obviously care
about you, no matter what.

170
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,400 
-We'll have your back no matter what.
-Yeah.

171
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,720 
But I think… Just be careful.

172
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,920 
You don't wanna lose too many friends.

173
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,640 
It's so hard.

174
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,360 
I'm torn between my best friend, Elle,
and my new squeeze, Sarah,

175
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,040 
but I'm also trying to keep the peace
amongst all our friends.

176
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,000 
It just sucks.
I can't believe I'm in this position.

177
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,680 
How do you feel about her? You still…

178
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,280 
I'm spending time with Sarah.
I'm getting to know her.

179
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,760 
I think she's a great girl.

180
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,520 
For me, can you just give her
a chance and get to know her?

181
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,720 
She's just trying to make it down
in Byron. You know what I mean?

182
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,040 
Yeah.

183
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,400 
I haven't heard Nathan
speak about a girl like this before.

184
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,280 
Maybe I misjudged Sarah.

185
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,000 
Makes you want to get to know her more.

186
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,520 
I mean, there's a lot going on
for Nathan right now.

187
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,120 
Have you spoken to Elias
since the fundraiser?

188
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,840 
No. I haven't seen
or spoken to Elias in ages.

189
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,200 
And then he sent me this text.
He goes, "Time to hash it out."

190
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,760 
"Meet me at the car park by the beach."

191
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,880 
That's like a bike racks
after school kinda thing.

192
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,400 
-Have you seen this?
-What?

193
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,240 
-Wait for it.
-Here we go.

194
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,760 
It's pretty funny. Wait.

195
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,240 
"Just biding my time."

196
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,720
{\an8}-Put a mouth guard in going to meet him.
-Then look at this next one.

197
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,240
{\an8}-No.
-"But it's inevitable."

198
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040 
That's pretty heavy.

199
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,200 
I mean, do you think that's about you?

200
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,160 
-I don't know.
-I reckon that's about you.

201
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,480 
-It probably is.
-Yeah.

202
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,800 
Elias has said all this shit about me
and called me a fuck boy.

203
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,680 
Then he's the one all pissed off.

204
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,560 
I've honestly just had enough now.
I'm gonna go sort this out.

205
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,160 
Byron. It is a small town.

206
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,680 
So the moment you have bad blood,
you have to face it.

207
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,600 
All of this drama has come about

208
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,200 
because he talked
shit about me behind my back.

209
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,800 
He makes it quite clear
that he thinks he's better than me.

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,480 
I know there's
a clear difference in our morality

211
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,080 
and when morals don't align,
there's always going to be conflict.

212
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,520 
And all I've done, in saying
that he is in fact a fuck boy,

213
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,920 
is kind of hit that nerve
right on the head

214
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,160 
and he's reacted.

215
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,880 
He thinks I'd do anything I possibly can
just to sleep with someone

216
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,880 
and that's my only goal.

217
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,480 
It actually really irritates me.

218
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,880 
Obviously, I wanted
to have a chat with you.

219
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,560 
-Yeah.
-About what happened.

220
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,080 
I just wanna get
to the bottom of it all and understand

221
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,680 
where these kind of feelings come from.

222
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,040 
I feel like
there's definitely an underlying

223
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,680 
feeling of resentment from you.

224
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,120 
I didn't go and call you a fuck boy.
Someone asked me if you were, right?

225
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,680 
I have my opinions about you.

226
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,320 
I think that you might be arrogant,
but it doesn't mean when they ask me,

227
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,080 
I'm gonna say you're this
and that. 'Cause I'm your mate.

228
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,040 
I'm meant to be your friend.
Friends have each other's back.

229
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,920 
You said, "Yes, I believe that of you.
Yes, I backed my actions in saying that."

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,400 
-All I wanted you to do is say sorry.
-I gave--

231
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,640 
I was transparent.
She asked a direct question.

232
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120 
-I gave a direct answer.
-Then you stand by and go…

233
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,080 
You did say, "Yes."
And that's what you think of me.

234
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,400 
And you said that to my face.

235
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,640 
Why would I just go, "Fair enough, mate."

236
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,280 
Shake hands. Sweet.
We're still friends. All good.

237
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,600 
I think Nathan is gonna be someone
who's always going to try and rationalize

238
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,760 
and justify anything he does
no matter how fucked up it is.

239
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,200 
He will find a way in his mind
to make him feel like the bigger man.

240
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,560 
This whole thing stems from you being
upset about this fuck boy thing.

241
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,000 
Why is that an issue?

242
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,760 
Why would a mate go behind my back?

243
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,120 
Then Sarah's like, "I don't wanna
hang out with this guy anymore…"

244
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,560 
What are you doing with Sarah?
Are you dating her?

245
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,360 
What does it matter to you?

246
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,240 
Because compiling actions lead
to my perspective of someone.

247
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,600 
So Elias clearly has an issue with me
because he is into Sarah.

248
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,920 
And that's because
he's jealous and insecure.

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200 
But fuck that shit.

250
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,640 
Your perspective is fucking this big.

251
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,280 
-You're so narrow-minded. You are.
-Yeah, right. Okay.

252
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,920 
It's crazy.
I'm not the first one to realize that.

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,600 
Cool. I said from the very start
of this whole thing

254
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,320 
that by the end of this
we'll either be like best mates

255
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,760 
or be fucking enemies.

256
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,800 
Your opinion to me means fuck all

257
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,600 
because I don't agree with you.
We don't see eye to eye.

258
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,960 
We don't
and I'm happy to leave it at that.

259
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040 
That's it.

260
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,200 
I can't even be bothered
with this guy anymore.

261
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,000 
I've got enough friends.
I don't need him in my life.

262
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,400 
The worst part about all of this is

263
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,160 
Elias talked shit about me
behind by my back to Sarah.

264
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,000 
I'm just hoping that Sarah and I
can move on with things

265
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,080 
without all of this bullshit
going on in the background.

266
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,040 
How've you been?

267
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,880 
Really good.
Just decompressing after the fundraiser.

268
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,400 
Totally.

269
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,160 
I've been dying to see Elle
ever since her fundraiser.

270
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,960 
Just to kind of see
what her take is on it.

271
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,680 
But mainly for Elle to kind of own up
to what she said about Sarah.

272
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,240 
How did the rest of your night go?

273
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,280 
Yeah, it was good.

274
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,720 
Obviously, I was super stoked
to raise the funds that we needed.

275
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,680 
But at the same time, of course,
Sarah and her approaching us

276
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,240 
for that whole conversation
really got me down.

277
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,600 
It's ridiculous.
I've never said she's fake.

278
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,360 
You kind of did say it.

279
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,040 
-At Cai's.
-I've never said that.

280
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,320 
Look, I always want to give
someone the benefit of the doubt,

281
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,840 
but, honestly,
there's something fake there.

282
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,960 
Elle did call Sarah fake.

283
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,760 
You don't need it deny to me.

284
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,520 
I was there. I heard you.

285
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,160 
It's a tricky situation

286
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,880 
because I think everyone
has said things about her.

287
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,400 
But what I've actually said,

288
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,160 
and I know I said
that she's not presenting herself

289
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,560 
in a way that I think she truly she is.

290
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,920 
And that's fine.

291
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,760 
There's this level of authenticity
we're not seeing from her.

292
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,360 
There's a bit of a difference.

293
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,320 
She said, "Fake."
Just say the word "fake."

294
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,120 
I don't know
why we're saying other fancy words,

295
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,840 
which mean the same thing.

296
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,720 
-I'm not saying she's fake.
-Yeah.

297
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,480 
You did say it, but I was never
going to not have your back.

298
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,800 
-So I was like, "No, no, no."
-No. I didn't say that.

299
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,280 
Clearly she's trying to
create a divide between Nathan and I.

300
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,440 
Nathan and I are super close.

301
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,280 
When it's just us two in the house

302
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,720 
we're like this really cute,
old married couple.

303
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,440 
I had my concerns
about Sarah from the start.

304
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,080 
She's from the Gold Coast.

305
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,360 
It's all about
short dresses and fake boobs.

306
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,160 
Just doesn't seem like
that's a good fit for Nathan

307
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,520 
because Nathan is
a really authentic person.

308
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,480 
Now there's been a massive disconnect
and his whole thought process

309
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,440 
is that I haven't made an effort
to get to know her.

310
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,280 
Which is true. But at the same time,

311
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,680 
she hasn't made
the effort to get to know me.

312
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,000 
You reckon that you're protective over him
when he sees a new girl or anything?

313
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,360 
No.

314
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,640 
-No?
-No.

315
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,440 
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I don't think Elle is being that fair</i>

316
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,840 
<i>with Nathan in this new relationship.</i>

317
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,880 
<i>Maybe she has feelings for him.</i>

318
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,360 
Elle was incredibly
convincing in telling me

319
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,400 
that she hadn't said
anything bad about me.

320
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,320 
And it's just made me really confused.
I don't know who to believe now.

321
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,800 
-Hi.
-Hello. How are you?

322
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,720 
-Good. How are you?
-Good.

323
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,960 
I'm looking forward
to seeing Nathan today,

324
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,400 
but I'm hoping he can ease my anxieties.

325
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,800 
-This is nice.
-Yeah.

326
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,600 
And that he can prove to me
that I can trust him.

327
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640 
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

328
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,160 
To another tequila.

329
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,560 
Sarah and I have had some difficulties
since the whole fuck boy thing.

330
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,000 
But now I need to make sure
that she knows,

331
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,720 
when it comes down to it,
I stand by her and I'm there to back her.

332
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,240 
I was cut that you had to leave
Elle's fundraiser so early.

333
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,400 
Yeah. I couldn't have gone back in
after I had spoken to Elle.

334
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,079 
It was just my time to go.

335
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,400 
She basically looked me in the eye
and was like, "I didn't say these things."

336
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,480 
-She's quite convincing, isn't she?
-She called me a liar.

337
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,920 
She was like, "You're lying."
It was so intense.

338
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000 
Yeah.

339
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,520 
I was like, "I'm not going to sit
and argue with you and a ruin your event."

340
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,480 
It surprised me to hear
that you actually confronted Elle.

341
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,600 
-That's a ballsy move. It is.
-Why?

342
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,360 
'Cause you don't want to fuck with her.
She says this to me all the time.

343
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,320 
She goes, "If you try to fuck me,
I'll fuck you ten times harder."

344
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,880 
I'm like, "Oh, my God."

345
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,320 
She's so hectic like that.

346
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,520 
We had a massive blowup about it.

347
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,280 
She was like,
"Why would you throw me under the bus?"

348
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360 
"Why would you do this?
And say that stuff?"

349
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,120 
But I said, "You did say this stuff."
And she goes,

350
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,560 
"No. I didn't."
And she denied it to me as well.

351
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,880 
It doesn't make me feel good
that Nathan and Elle are fighting.

352
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,640 
They obviously have had
a friendship long before I moved to town.

353
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,000 
But to hear that Nathan is standing by me
makes me feel really good.

354
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,480 
It's got to the point now where,

355
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,280 
it's not really somebody
that I wanna be friends with.

356
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,480 
Yeah. I understand.

357
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,120 
And I'm definitely not gonna kiss her ass
and try to make her like me.

358
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,440 
-Yeah.
-I'm just over it.

359
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,040 
It's like changing
how I feel about the whole place

360
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,560 
and the whole experience of being here.

361
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,760 
That's not good to hear.
I don't like that.

362
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,040 
I know for a fact,

363
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,080 
and I've said this to Elle before,
you're a great person.

364
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,520 
And, I swear to God, I'm in your corner.

365
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,080 
I'm in your corner. Backing you hard.

366
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,720 
I'm really grateful

367
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,360 
that you've stood up for me
because there's not many people

368
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,560 
in this town
that I've met that are genuine.

369
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,880 
I want you to know that I appreciate that.

370
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,840 
-It's all good.
-Okay. Thank you.

371
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,600 
Nathan's got my back.

372
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680 
After everything we've gone through,

373
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,880 
the fact that he's still
standing by me is fucking cool.

374
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,000 
It's not the first time I've heard,
you know, someone like you

375
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,120 
trying to move down to Byron,
to have a change of scenery and whatnot,

376
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,120 
and completely feel like
you're being alienated.

377
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,680 
-Yes.
-Which sucks.

378
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,960 
Maybe we should go
and spend the night in the hinterlands.

379
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,480 
-Get out of Byron.
-Really?

380
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,520 
Really?

381
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600 
I mean, yeah. If you wanna.

382
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,120 
It's freaking amazing.

383
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,120 
-Yeah. Okay.
-Yeah.

384
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,720 
Come here.

385
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,240 
It means so much to me
that Nathan is in my corner.

386
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,320 
I don't know why
Elle has a problem with me.

387
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,880 
-Let's get out of here.
-Yeah.

388
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,760 
I feel like she is kind of annoyed
that I've taken Nathan away from her.

389
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,840 
Look at this day. It's gonna be so good.

390
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,360 
Beautiful.

391
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,040 
How's the surf looking?

392
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,720 
-It's kind of big.
-Looks good though.

393
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,560 
-It's good.
-Will you get out there?

394
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,840 
Yeah, definitely.

395
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,000 
This is standard Byron.

396
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,680 
Amazing day,
amazing waves, drinks on the beach.

397
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,880 
Reckon it'll put
everyone in the best mood.

398
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,160 
Is that Sarah with Nathan?

399
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,520 
Good day for skimming.

400
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,440 
-What's that?
-Skipping rocks.

401
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,000 
Yes.

402
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,760 
Maybe we should do that instead.

403
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,160 
There is tension between everyone
in the group at the moment.

404
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,640 
But it is one good opportunity
to make a big effort to get to know Sarah.

405
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,480 
It would take
so much of a load off Nathan.

406
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,240 
If Sarah would give me a bit of time,
maybe I might feel the same way

407
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080 
and I might get along with her.

408
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,920 
-Hello. How are you guys?
-What a surprise.

409
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,480 
-Hi.
-How are you?

410
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,920 
-Good. How are you?
-Good.

411
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,440 
-This is nice. Your whole outfit.
-Thanks. You look cute.

412
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,080 
Feel free, esky down here.

413
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,840 
-Thank you for inviting us.
-How are you?

414
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,840 
-Hello.
-Hello. How are you?

415
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,640 
So who else is coming?

416
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,800 
There's one person,
I'm not too sure if they're 100% coming.

417
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,640 
I have a feeling
that Elle might be a bit jealous

418
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,920 
because she's just not coping
with Sarah and Nathan dating.

419
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,440 
I did try and get to the bottom of it.

420
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,680 
But I think
I need to ask Nathan about that.

421
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,400 
She may still be coming.
I just have a feeling.

422
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,360 
It wouldn't surprise me
if she didn't come.

423
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,520 
-Babe, did you want a rosé or something?
-I'd love a rosé.

424
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,680 
Are you gonna have a rosé, Sarah?

425
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,080 
-I'm all right with water for now.
-Yeah?

426
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,040 
Yeah.

427
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,360 
All right.

428
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,320 
Yeah, boy!

429
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,480 
-How are we?
-How're you doing?

430
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,480 
Yay, team!

431
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,920 
-Oh, my God!
-Hello!

432
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,880 
-Hey, brother.
-How are you?

433
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,120 
-Hello!
-Where's your surfboard?

434
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,480 
-I can't surf for shit.
-More of a Lauren thing.

435
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,920 
-Here's Elias.
-What's cracking?

436
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,240 
-Simba!
-How are you?

437
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,160 
I think it's good to have
a bit of it beach day like this.

438
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,200 
Yeah.

439
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,880 
Just hope everyone
has a chat and has a good time.

440
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,440 
Yeah. Leave
everything out there in the surf.

441
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,920 
-Pretty much.
-Yeah.

442
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,000 
How are you?

443
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,840 
-I feel awkward.
-Why? What's going?

444
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,920 
I haven't seen everyone
since the incident.

445
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,840 
-I don't really know how to be.
-You guys want some more?

446
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,960 
Yes, please.

447
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,960 
Be you, darl. You were never in the wrong.

448
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,040 
I want to just get over it and move on.

449
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,080 
But I don't know if Elle's coming today
and I don't know how to move forward.

450
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,200 
I'm spending heaps of time with Nathan,

451
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,640 
but he lives with Elle
and I'm hearing two different things.

452
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,640 
Reckon she was looking into your face,

453
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,000 
saying, "I never said it."
But actually did?

454
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,640 
-Yeah.
-She is a psychopath.

455
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,280 
How about I do a little groundwork?
I'll have a conversation with Elle.

456
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,920 
Sarah deserves some
straight up answers from Elle.

457
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,240 
If she won't tell me,
maybe she'll tell you.

458
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,600 
And if you can do some recon,
I would love you forever.

459
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,120 
Bit of barbeque action?

460
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,520 
Do you guys need a top up of rosé?

461
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,280 
Take all of that bathing suit off,
Elias, now, you sexy dog.

462
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,480 
It nearly came off.

463
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,520 
I needed this. Beach day.

464
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,400 
-Hi, Ally.
-Hello, darl.

465
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,400 
How have you been? Have you been busy?

466
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,440 
Yeah, I've been all right. I love this.

467
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,840 
Thanks.

468
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,640 
I wanna find out
if Elle has said nasty things about Sarah.

469
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,600 
When challenged on it,
Jess is the kind of person to come clean.

470
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,320 
At the Save the Mermaids party,
there was a bit of tension

471
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,160 
because Sarah's been
talking to me for a while

472
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,600 
about people saying that she was fake.

473
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,520 
Okay.

474
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,840 
And she brought it up with Elle
and Elle just flat out said,

475
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,280 
"I never said that."

476
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,960 
But there was this story going around.

477
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,400 
I think it was you, Lauren and Hannah,
discussing Sarah after Cai's event.

478
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,120 
Is that something that happened?

479
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,200 
So, I was standing with Hannah
and Elle and Sas around the fire.

480
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,440 
And they were talking about…
Yeah, they were talking about that.

481
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,280 
They were saying that they don't know her
and they think she's a bit fake.

482
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,680 
Perfect. Now I've got you.

483
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,960 
Elle, you called her fake
and now you're about to get called on it.

484
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,640 
All right. Elle's here.

485
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,480 
-Hey, hello.
-How are you?

486
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,920 
-Good. How are you?
-Good.

487
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,160 
What's happening?

488
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,720 
-Hello.
-Hi, gorgeous. How are you?

489
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,920 
-You good?
-Good.

490
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,880 
I'm one of your best mates,

491
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,600 
and I still don't understand this whole
situation with Elle, you and Sarah.

492
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,960 
That threesome relationship

493
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,680 
does not sound like
the good type of threesome.

494
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,760 
That's pretty much it.

495
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440 
-Elle! Hi, honey.
-Hi!

496
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,400 
Hello.

497
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,960 
-Are you good?
-Yeah. Good.

498
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,440 
How are you feeling after your event?

499
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440 
Were you okay? You and Sarah okay?

500
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,280 
That was a really shit time
for her to do that.

501
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,360 
You know, there's a time and place
for those sorts of conversations.

502
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,600 
-My fundraiser wasn't the time to do that.
-No. Not at all.

503
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,800 
She did actually really hurt me
because she spoke about Nathan,

504
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,440 
saying that I said
those things about Sarah.

505
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,680 
-Did you call Sarah fake?
-No.

506
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,840 
See, we just talked and Jess said you did.

507
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,520 
-Like…
-When?

508
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,920 
Throwing me under the bus.
But, yeah. You said that she was fake.

509
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,640 
But you weren't saying it in a bitchy way.

510
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,560 
You were saying it backing Nathan.

511
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,920 
Jess is meant to be a friend.

512
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,520 
But Alex just dropped a bomb
between Jess and I.

513
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,720 
This Sarah debacle
actually feels ridiculous.

514
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,960 
All the girls were basically going around
saying that they didn't like her.

515
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,680 
And I said I need
to get to know her more.

516
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,240 
I don't know enough about her.

517
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,520 
What she's done so far,

518
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,760 
the way she's presented herself,
the comments she's made… I think--

519
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840 
I can't--

520
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,600 
You think she's trying
to project something she's not?

521
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,000 
Yeah. I don't know.

522
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,920 
It's lazy to call someone fake
without knowing them.

523
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,320 
The way she's presenting herself
isn't truly who she is. That's--

524
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,440 
I don't know. The whole thing just
comes across as very <i>Mean Girls</i> to me.

525
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,000 
-No.
-I feel like--

526
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,240 
Sarah's my friend.
I'm not gonna listen to it.

527
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,400 
It's very <i>Mean Girls.</i>

528
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,440 
-You guys have your <i>Mean Girls--</i>
-But that's what you're like.

529
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,800 
You're like that too, mate.

530
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,120 
I didn't mean for it to be like that.
I didn't realize that was the situation.

531
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,600 
-And I said--
-What do you mean you didn't realize?

532
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,440 
-Of course you did.
-No. I didn't…

533
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,800 
When we were talking
about it, it was casual.

534
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,800 
I was really annoyed at Jess.
I think she handled that so poorly.

535
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,360 
When I said "fake,"

536
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,440 
I didn't think that was gonna
make you feel like I was telling Alex

537
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,760 
all this shit about you.
'Cause I was not doing that at all.

538
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,360 
Okay. That just happened
in front of my face sort of thing.

539
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,560 
You think I was talking shit about you?

540
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,600 
That was an innocent conversation.
He's just a drama queen.

541
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,120 
That's not how it happened.

542
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,000 
He's like, "You said Elle said this."
That's not what I said at all.

543
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,800 
-We were having a conversation--
-You just did.

544
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,200 
-No. I said--
-You just did, Jess.

545
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,240 
How? How? How did I say that?

546
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,960 
-How did I say that?
-Oh, my God.

547
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,400 
Elle's trying to keep up
with this image that she's an angel

548
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,560 
and she would never say
anything wrong about someone.

549
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,920 
Don't make me out to be a liar

550
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,360 
because you don't wanna
own up to what you said.

551
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,760 
Pissed me off, definitely.

552
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,640 
So what happened?

553
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,760 
I was talking to Jess
about this conversation.

554
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,240 
Jess said, "Yeah, it happened."
Elle called you fake.

555
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,800 
They all called you fake.
I was like, "Well…"

556
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,880 
-Elle's denying she's ever said that.
-Yeah.

557
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,920 
So, when I was speaking to Elle, I said,

558
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,320 
"Did you say this about Sarah?"
She goes, "No."

559
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,160 
And I threw Jess under the bus,
"Well, Jess said you did."

560
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,440 
I think Elle wants the world to believe
that she's a really good person,

561
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,120 
and she's a perfect person, which is
a pretty exhausting title to hold up.

562
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,600 
I think she just needs to be real with
herself and admit it when she fucks up.

563
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,520 
What is it that I present
when you don't know who I am

564
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,040 
that you think is fake?

565
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,040 
I have no idea. I don't know.

566
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,560 
I'm just sick of it, you know?
Grow the fuck up.

567
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,040 
It's been really challenging not having
any close girlfriends in this town.

568
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,920 
Just to debrief on everything
and have somebody close by

569
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,960 
that understands what I'm going through.

570
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,200 
No worries, darl. My hands are cold.

571
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,760 
-But your heart is warm.
-My heart is warm.

572
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,560 
Hey. So, Sarah?

573
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,600 
-Yeah. I mean…
-Tell me more.

574
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,440 
Have you seen her
since we saw you at the shaping?

575
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,000 
Yes.

576
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,240 
And?

577
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,480 
-Well, I mean…
-Tell me. What happened?

578
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,840 
Yeah. We had a little date.
It was cool and it was really nice.

579
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,000 
-It was nice?
-Yeah.

580
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,800 
We went for a couple of drinks,
and then we hung out

581
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,200 
most of the night having drinks.
It was nice.

582
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,520 
And then… Yeah.
Now we're just hand-holding these days.

583
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,480 
You're hand-holding? Look at you.

584
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,920 
-It makes me happy if you're happy.
-Thanks.

585
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000 
Come here.

586
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,800 
Nathan does seem like
he has genuine, strong feelings for Sarah.

587
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,800 
But I think there's a lot more going on
between Nathan and Elle.

588
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,160 
I need to figure out
what the hell is going on.

589
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480 
What about Elle?

590
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,120 
How is she taking it all?

591
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760 
She's not happy.

592
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,440 
Look, I've tried to keep it a secret,

593
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,800 
but we actually did…

594
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,520 
Way, way, ages ago.
One drunken night we ended up kissing.

595
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,560 
Really?

596
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,840 
Fuck.

597
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,520 
I should not have said that.

598
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,960 
Nathan's playing with some serious fire.

599
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,680 
So, if you and Elle do have history,
do you reckon she's jealous?

600
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,920 
Yes.

601
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,000 
I'm so excited. This looks very good.

602
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,240 
You'll like it. It looks like a lot of
green and health, but it's actually good.

603
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,520 
-Need a good green smoothie.
-I know.

604
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,160 
This is what we need
from eating burgers and stuff.

605
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,240 
-Now we need greens.
-A good detox from yesterday.

606
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,040 
What happened with you and Elle?

607
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,920 
-Oh, my God. It was so annoying.
-Yeah.

608
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,080 
I was talking to Alex
and I briefly said to him

609
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,120 
that we were all talking about Sarah
and how we don't get along with her.

610
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,600 
He was kind of fishing. He kept bringing
Sarah up and then Elle walked over.

611
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,480 
And then all of a sudden
he just throws it at her like,

612
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,360 
"Jess told me that you said
Sarah was fake."

613
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,320 
Then Elle, her face just like went…

614
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,960 
-To the devil and she was literally--
-The daggers.

615
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,000 
Yeah, she was ready to like take me down.

616
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,320 
She was gaslighting me. She was trying to
make me look… And I, in that moment,

617
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,600 
was like, "Am I making this up?
Did this not happen?"

618
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,440 
That's how confused I felt.
'Cause she was looking at me

619
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,120 
like I was just so out of line.

620
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,680 
It's interesting. This happened to me.

621
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,680 
So, I caught up with Elle
for a drink and I said to her,

622
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,560 
"You called Sarah fake."

623
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,640 
And she just looked at me and was like,
"I did not say that."

624
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,840 
I was like, "But you did."

625
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,520 
She's just
making us look like we're lying.

626
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,840 
Lying. Yeah.

627
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,440 
Elle is making Jess
and I look like idiots.

628
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,440 
And I have all this juicy goss
that explains everything

629
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,880 
about the way that she's been behaving.

630
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,760 
So, just between you and I…
Keep it right on the down-low.

631
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,400 
Nathan told me that

632
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,520 
Elle and him have hooked up in the past.

633
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,400 
-Yeah.
-No way.

634
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,840 
The whole thing is all a little bit funny.

635
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,200 
Just like a one-night stand?
What are we talking here?

636
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,560 
So Nathan told me they had hooked up once.

637
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,640 
When someone says that,
it's probably a few more times.

638
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,360 
-They live together.
-Yeah.

639
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,080 
It would have happened
multiple times for sure.

640
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,720 
-Yeah.
-So maybe it's not like…

641
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,960 
-A protective friend.
-That's the thing.

642
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,920 
-It's not a protective friend.
-She's maybe a bit jealous.

643
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,680 
She's 100% jealous.

644
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,000 
It's all starting to make sense now why
Elle is lying about calling Sarah fake.

645
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,520 
Because they are the love triangle.
It's not Elias.

646
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,040 
It's Elle, Sarah and Nathan.

647
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,639 
I feel like this just makes
so much more sense now.

648
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,960 
It just didn't add up why she was reacting
so harsh to such a small, minor situation.

649
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,880 
So, Elle's mad.

650
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,639 
And I think it's like,
"I have feelings for you" mad.

651
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,159 
And so think about it,
how does Elle's partner Stav feel?

652
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,280 
-Oh, my God. I forgot about Stav.
-Yeah.

653
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,199 
I don't think Stav knows
that they've hooked up.

654
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,199 
-What the fuck?
-I know.

655
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,480 
And also Sarah.

656
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,480 
You know,
this triangle has just become so messy.

657
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,040 
This will catch up with Elle.

658
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,639 
Byron Bay is such a small town.
Nothing stays a secret for long here.

659
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,239 
It's all just going to come to the surface
and it's going to explode.

660
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,639 
So hectic.
