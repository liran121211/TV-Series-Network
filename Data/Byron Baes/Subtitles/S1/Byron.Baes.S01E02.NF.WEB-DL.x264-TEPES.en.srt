1
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,240 
<i>It's been so long since I've seen ya</i>
<i>My body, oh, how I miss ya</i>

2
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,080 
<i>I'm so tired of screaming</i>

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,640 
<i>But I can't help feeling that</i>
<i>This could be us</i>

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,760 
<i>But they're keeping us apart</i>
<i>This could be us</i>

5
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,640 
I came to Byron to take my music seriously
and to build an audience.

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,560 
Byron is like a hub for creative people.

7
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,840 
Hello.

8
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,080 
<i>Hey. Where are you?</i>

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,560 
I'm on the way out to go see Sarah.

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,680 
This studio address. Is this for real?

11
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,360 
I'm driving through a paddock.

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,680 
<i>Definitely the address.</i>
<i>Why? What are you looking at?</i>

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760 
Oh, my God. There's a fucking cow.

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,320 
Sarah has a voice. She can sing.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,200 
I think there's potential
for her to make a lot of money

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,640 
and I want to tap into that brand.

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,520 
Louis Vuitton doesn't buy itself.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,800 
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,880 
<i>Alex is gonna be a big part</i>
<i>of helping establish my career,</i>

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,960 
<i>and I really think</i>
<i>that we're becoming friends.</i>

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,120 
So how are you feeling after the party?

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,680 
It was a fun party.
I'm really sad you left.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,600 
-Who'd you like?
-Everyone.

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,120 
But it's good you left 'cause you would've
rolled your eyes the whole time.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,920 
I had RSI from rolling my eyes.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,120 
I need to go see
an optometrist after this.

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,840 
Do you know who I found fascinating
at that party?

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,240 
-Who?
-Jade.

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,440 
-Hannah?
-Hi!

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,400 
When he walked in,
the light hit all that Cartier jewelry.

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,280 
-It nearly blinded me.
-Yeah.

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,400 
I was like, "It's a walking disco ball."

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,600 
-He's a whole vibe. Yeah.
-He is.

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,560 
He has a million followers on Insta.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800 
-So I went on and had a look.
-Yeah.

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,000 
Something weird there.

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,600 
I think his audience is a bit bullshit.

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,800 
He might not be buying them,
but I don't know.

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,040 
I just get annoyed
when people have inflated numbers.

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,920 
If it's all bullshit…
Sorry, darl. I gotta call you on it.

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,760 
Fake followers piss me off.

42
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,280 
If you go up against my talent
for the same job with your fake followers

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560 
and you win it,
that's money that my talent should've got.

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,040 
Do you know who I thought was fun? Nathan.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,600 
How you going? I'm Nathan.

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,040 
-Hi. You look amazing.
-Alex.

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,400 
-Sarah. Lovely to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,880 
I think Nathan's a fun time.

49
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,280 
He actually invited me out
to show me around Byron.

50
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,880 
Out of everyone at that party,

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,400 
I'm really glad that Nathan's the one
that you're going to go on "a date"…

52
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,440 
We're calling it a date?

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,360 
He just said he'll show me around.

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,920 
So for all I know, we could just be pals.

55
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,280 
How are you cooking the salmon?

56
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,760
{\an8}Gonna sear it in the pan.

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,840
{\an8}Salmon, brocc and then--

58
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,440 
-Brocc to make you rock?
-No.

59
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,360 
-That's the chef's tea towel.
-I'm a chefette. I can borrow it.

60
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,440 
Elle and I live together.

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,640 
We've lived together
for about six months now.

62
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,240 
I got the kangaroo whip now.

63
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,360 
<i>And she's quite flirty with me.</i>

64
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,080 
-You want this.
-No.

65
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,280 
You want this. I know.

66
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,080 
No, I don't. No.

67
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,960 
Oh, my God.

68
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040 
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,440 
Love me.

70
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,400 
I honestly think it's funny
when Elle gets kind of jealous

71
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,600 
about me hanging out
or talking about other girls.

72
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,160 
'Cause she's got a boyfriend.

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,680 
-'Sup, guys? What's cooking?
-Hey, Stavie.

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,200 
<i>I guess Elle's boyfriend, Stav,</i>
<i>is in Byron maybe once every two weeks.</i>

75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,880
{\an8}I heard a big smack upstairs.
What's going on?

76
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,080
{\an8}Nathan whipped me with a tea towel.

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,640 
Fun.

78
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,040 
How long you around for, Stav?

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,800 
I'm only here for a short while.

80
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,080 
-I've gotta go back to Magnetic Island.
-Yeah.

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,400 
You'd think that when Stav
comes back to town

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,480 
that Elle would kind of like pull back
and not be so like lovey-dovey with me,

83
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,760 
but she doesn't at all.

84
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,200 
She still is like, "Love you… Oh, Nath."

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,920 
Looking out the corner
of your eye and Stav's there.

86
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,680 
Meet anyone interesting at the party?

87
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,000 
There was Sarah.

88
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,120 
-She was nice.
-Is she from Byron?

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,560 
She's from the Goldie.
She's moved here though.

90
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,800 
Do you like her?

91
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,640 
From what I've seen, she's pretty cool.

92
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,640 
I feel like Nathan can do
so much better than Sarah.

93
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,480 
She's from the Gold Coast

94
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,120 
and the Gold Coast
is all about fake boobs, big lips.

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,200 
Nathan's not interested in that 'cause
Nathan is a really authentic person.

96
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,280 
She's a singer.
That's pretty cool. Girl with talent.

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,320 
Yeah.

98
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,680 
So do you want to go on a date with her?

99
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,520 
Yeah. I'll take her out
for dinner or something.

100
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,880 
Yeah.

101
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,240 
Why don't we crack out the wine?

102
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880 
Yeah.

103
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,960
{\an8}My Johansen event is coming up
and it is my first-ever catwalk.

104
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,880 
My business is all online,

105
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,280 
so it's super stressful
because I'm trying to make sure

106
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,040 
I represent the same image
that I have online, in person.

107
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,400 
Oh, my God.

108
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,560 
Jade! How are you?

109
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,040 
-Babe! Hi!
-Hey! Look at you with all your clothes.

110
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800 
This is so pretty.

111
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,840 
-Thank you.
-Hey!

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,200 
-How are you?
-Good. Good.

113
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,800 
I am Australia's number one
most followed male influencer.

114
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800 
I came to Byron to connect
with some other influencers.

115
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,080 
We all just want acceptance and
it is so good to have a friend in fashion.

116
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,200 
I'm stressed about what to wear
to the Johansen launch. I've no idea.

117
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,280 
So the location is super cream tones
and jungle theme.

118
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,200 
Perfect.

119
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,600 
So I love this because
everyone's going to be in creamy colors.

120
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,440 
-Perfect.
-You know, that kind of vibe?

121
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,280 
-Thank you, baby. I was stressing out.
-You'll be okay.

122
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,680 
You're gonna look amazing.

123
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,440 
I would absolutely die if I walked in and
seen somebody in the same outfit as me.

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,360 
I'd be so embarrassed I would leave.

125
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,880 
That to me would just be…

126
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,720 
You need to try on this puffer.
Let me grab it.

127
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,640 
-This is the jacket.
-Oh, my God.

128
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,760 
This is so you.

129
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,040 
-Look at this. Yes.
-I love it.

130
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,560 
By the time I'm done with you,

131
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,200 
you're gonna be wearing
all of these clothes just 24/7.

132
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,400 
-Yes!
-I love it.

133
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,640 
I'm obsessed with this.

134
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,240 
I need to pay you for this.

135
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,360 
No. It's a gift.

136
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,160 
I'll smash it on my socials then.

137
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,360 
Let's get a mirror shot.

138
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,800 
This is gonna sell out because of you.

139
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,120 
-Babe, Hannah's Ibiza party.
-I know.

140
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,960 
-Now, that was a whole new…
-Interesting, right?

141
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,840 
Did you end up getting the…
An apology from her?

142
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,800 
She ended up apologizing,
but it wasn't sincere.

143
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,600 
So, yes, I…

144
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,120 
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-I am sorry.

145
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,840 
You're sorry? Are you actually sorry?

146
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,720 
I expected more from her,
like, "I've missed you."

147
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,320 
And like, "I love you
and I want it to be better."

148
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,440 
But it wasn't like that.
I don't know. I was disappointed.

149
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,560 
-Did you invite her to the launch?
-Yeah.

150
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,320 
In my heart, I want her there
because we were friends for so long

151
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,280 
and she's seen me grow this brand.

152
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,920 
She's seen how hard I work,
but I just don't want her making it

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,280 
about anything but Johansen
and the brand, you know?

154
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,600 
'Cause if she can be on her best behavior,

155
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,600 
-I'm happy for her to come.
-Yeah.

156
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,799 
I didn't work six years to have
Hannah do something at my event.

157
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,760 
It's so weird because
she actually sent me a text message.

158
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,280 
She's like, "J, darling.
So lovely to meet you the other night

159
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,440 
and thank you for my crystal."

160
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,920 
"You're so sweet. Would you like to come
to the Crystal Castle with me?"

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,040 
Oh, my goodness.

162
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,600 
No way.

163
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,800 
I'm so nervous
about meeting up with Hannah.

164
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,880 
When it comes to their feud,
I am team Jess,

165
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,560 
but after the party, I definitely feel
that Hannah and I can be friends.

166
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840 
Maybe I might go.

167
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,960 
Yeah. 100% go
and don't judge her based off me.

168
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,600 
Hannah's a lot of fun.
Just don't get on her bad side.

169
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,000 
All right. Let's move around.

170
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,080 
Simba and I met at the gym.

171
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,440 
Yeah. It's about a eight-year
bromance with Simba.

172
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,920 
-I knocked all of the padding out of them.
-Did you?

173
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,320 
Simba's like this larger-than-life,
whimsical shamanic healer.

174
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,920 
Bouncy. All right.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,280 
Let's see which chicken leg will win.

176
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,760 
Come on. Body shots only.

177
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,960 
You think the face is the body.

178
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,240 
On the surface, me and Elias
seem like an unlikely friendship.

179
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,960 
Okay. One, two, three, four.

180
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,240 
He's in this world of modeling and surfing

181
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,280 
and I'm a holistic health
and spiritual coach.

182
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,680 
I'm a bit more of a hippie,
bit more alternative.

183
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,360 
I don't think I'm an influencer.

184
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,600 
I think I'm an inspirer.

185
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,680 
That was good, man.

186
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,760 
What a day.

187
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,480 
How'd you find Hannah's party
the other day?

188
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,040 
It was good. Pretty chill.

189
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,880 
-Did you connect with anyone?
-Yeah.

190
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960 
-What was that girl--
-Sarah?

191
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,640 
-Yeah!
-Yeah. She's a cool chick.

192
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,440 
I think it's a bit more
beneath the surface

193
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,320 
than initially meets the eye with her.

194
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,040 
I had this weird moment
when she was talking about this saying

195
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,960 
that she resonates with,
"jack of all trades, master of none."

196
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,880 
I was like, "No way."
I took my ring off like, "Look at that."

197
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,680 
It was a trippy moment. I was like…

198
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,640 
Very cool. Maybe she picked up
on some sort of innate, kind of,

199
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720 
you know, undercurrent kind of vibe.

200
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,680 
Yeah. I honestly think she did.

201
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,160 
I'm like a jack of all trades
and a master of none.

202
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,480 
What does that say?

203
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,640 
Stop! No!

204
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,680 
It was good to meet Sarah.
I think she's a deep thinker.

205
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,680 
Hopefully she's going
to the Johansen event

206
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,920 
because she's someone
I want to get to know a lot better.

207
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,600 
We had a couple
of cool moments there for sure.

208
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,520 
Yeah.

209
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,640 
We were chatting, her, me and Nathan,

210
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,600 
talking about who has
the biggest energy or whatever else.

211
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,120 
She's just like,
"I think confidence is quiet."

212
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,480 
"I like that. It's cool. Interesting."

213
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,000 
Nathan offered to show Sarah around town,
but, to be honest,

214
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,440 
Sarah made it pretty clear that she's
more in tune with myself than Nathan.

215
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,240 
Go.

216
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,400 
I'm pretty keen to show Sarah around town.

217
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,520 
When I do things, I go to the nth degree.
If I do it, I do it right.

218
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,160 
I love curating an experience
with someone.

219
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,960 
I think Sarah's great,

220
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,440 
and honestly, my heart's racing
and I don't know what to expect from this.

221
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,960 
Hi.

222
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,440 
Hi, baby.

223
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520 
How you doing?

224
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,240 
Hi. Good. How are you?

225
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320 
I'm good.

226
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,240 
Good to see you.

227
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,600 
-You, too.
-This is Neo.

228
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,280 
Hi, baby. Oh, my gosh. She's so cute.

229
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,680 
Got vegan treats
'cause I remember you're vegan.

230
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,520 
That's so sweet. I love that.

231
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,000 
That's so nice.

232
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,880 
When I saw the picnic set-up,
it definitely took me by surprise.

233
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,280 
I didn't pick Nathan
for the romantic type.

234
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,920 
Nathan made me feel
really comfortable, really quickly.

235
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840 
Cheers.

236
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,920 
To moving to Byron.

237
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,360 
Moving to Byron.

238
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,000 
How you settling in?

239
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,080 
It was hard moving somewhere,
not knowing anyone.

240
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,480 
Yeah.

241
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,520 
Especially in Byron where people feel like
they have to protect this place.

242
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,120 
-They're so cautious of people coming in.
-I get that.

243
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,760 
The perception of Byron,
it's like this hippie town.

244
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,800 
So loving and so caring
and you're gonna be sitting in a circle,

245
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,560 
playing bongos, singing,
and everyone's gonna invite you over.

246
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,080 
-It's actually the opposite of that now.
-Yeah.

247
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,880 
But I came here to find my people
and I definitely did that.

248
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,040 
It's like if you're in a bad mood,
you think everybody's death-staring you,

249
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,480 
and in a good mood,
you think everyone's friendly.

250
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,800 
You've got no idea.

251
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,040 
You know me, the other night,
running around dancing, being crazy.

252
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,280 
Everyone's like,
"This guy's the most confident guy."

253
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,040 
But I'm the least confident guy.

254
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,360 
-I just know how to act confident.
-Really?

255
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,960 
I wouldn't tell that about you.

256
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,160 
I know. No one does.

257
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,000 
But I understand 'cause
I've been a performer my whole life.

258
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,600 
So I get when I have
to be out in social situations,

259
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,640 
to turn it on
and be a certain type of person.

260
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,000 
Yeah.

261
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,160 
I definitely think I got to see
the real side of Nathan a little bit.

262
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,800 
It was nice to hear him share

263
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,680 
that he was a little bit more vulnerable
than what he leads on to everyone.

264
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480 
-Hi, baby. You're all wet.
-Hey, girl.

265
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,960 
She's like…

266
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,440 
So I'm gonna ask something of you.

267
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,600 
I brought my ukulele down here and
I thought, "I want to do a little song."

268
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,000 
-And if you wouldn't mind--
-I would love that.

269
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,120 
-You can say no.
-No. I would love that.

270
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,720 
If you can film me.

271
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,120 
-For my Instagram.
-I can.

272
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,360 
-But I wanna see you in action.
-Okay.

273
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,920 
-Okay. Cool. Thank you.
-100%.

274
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,480 
All right.

275
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,160 
You look good. This is good.

276
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480 
Serenade me.

277
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,280 
<i>So I pulled you up</i>
<i>'Cause you're shady</i>

278
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,280 
<i>But you pull me close</i>
<i>And the anger faded</i>

279
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,880 
<i>You give me faraway vibes</i>

280
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,480 
<i>You light me up with a smile</i>

281
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,280 
<i>You're gonna wreck my good time</i>

282
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,760 
That was amazing.

283
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,480 
Thank you.

284
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,520 
-I think I fell in love today.
-Did you?

285
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,480 
That was really intense.

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,360 
I got goosebumps.

287
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,920 
-Really?
-No, honestly.

288
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,360 
-It was so nice.
-Thank you.

289
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,680 
I wanna give you a hug.

290
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,120 
-There's…
-I'll stand up.

291
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,680 
There's some feels in that.

292
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,600 
Thank you for that.

293
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,320 
-Thank you for filming.
-That was amazing.

294
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,480 
You're the first one to hear that song
'cause I just wrote it.

295
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560 
-So congratulations.
-That was insane.

296
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,080 
Holy crap. I feel honored and blessed.

297
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,200 
Thank you.

298
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,560 
I was about to kiss you.

299
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,480 
Really? No, you're joking.

300
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,840 
I don't kiss on the first date.

301
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,280 
Is it a date?

302
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,800 
I thought we were hanging out
and getting the grand tour of Byron.

303
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,720 
That's the thing--

304
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,320 
-This is better. I'm not complaining.
-No. But after that, I was like, "Shit!"

305
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,360 
"Maybe I need to show you
around Byron more."

306
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,000 
'Cause that was pretty insane.

307
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,360 
I do need to be shown
around Byron. So, yeah.

308
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,640 
-Yeah. Right.
-This is cute.

309
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,760 
For the first time since I got here,
I feel like I might actually fit in here.

310
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,080 
I'm feeling nervous meeting Hannah

311
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,920 
because things are not fine
between Jess and Hannah

312
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,400 
and I feel a really strong bond
and alliance with Jess.

313
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,000 
But, you know, I'm new to Byron
and I do want new friends,

314
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,840 
so I'm willing to give it a shot.

315
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,040 
I hope I can
bring them back together again.

316
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,640 
Hey, babe.

317
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,200 
I feel someone's energy next to me.

318
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,839 
Yeah. It's me. It's Jade.

319
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,440 
Hi.

320
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240 
How are you?

321
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,680 
Hi.

322
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,760 
When I first met Jade,
I felt like our energies

323
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,160 
were just high vibing.

324
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,800 
What is this?

325
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,960 
So this is…

326
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,119 
It's an amethyst, right? But it's a geode.

327
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,360 
What does a geode mean?

328
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,880 
It means… If you put them together,
they're perfect…

329
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,480 
They stick back together perfectly.

330
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400 
Crystal Castle is very Byron.

331
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,120 
Let's have a walk around.

332
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,760 
It's a lot different to what
I ever experienced in the Gold Coast.

333
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,640 
Oh, my God. It's a dragon egg.

334
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,440 
A what? A dragon egg?

335
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,240 
I'm like… Look at this though!

336
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,000 
-Are you meant to get in there?
-You kidding me?

337
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520 
Yeah.

338
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,400 
Oh, my God. Let's squish in.

339
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,360 
We go in?

340
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,480 
Okay.

341
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,760 
-Okay.
-Nice.

342
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,320 
Are you feeling it?

343
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,040 
I personally

344
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,200 
am feeling…

345
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,480 
The buzz?

346
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,200 
Yeah.

347
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,400 
-Are you not feeling the vibe?
-No.

348
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,800 
Honestly, if the word "vibe" was invented,
this would be why.

349
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,280 
Sitting inside a 120-million-year-old--

350
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200 
How do they know
it's 120 million years old?

351
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,000 
Because no one's
120 million years old in real life.

352
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,920 
How do they know that?

353
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,040 
It's like when they find
dragon bones and stuff like that.

354
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,160 
-Where do they find dragon bones?
-There's some in Australia.

355
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,640 
Okay.

356
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,480 
Dragon bones are not real.

357
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,920 
Hannah is completely in her own world.

358
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,440 
She's a new level of different
I've never met before.

359
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,040 
But I'm here for it.

360
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,920 
The rose quartz crystals behind us,
looking at the view.

361
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000 
Perfect.

362
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,200 
When did you move here?

363
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,800 
I only just moved here
literally last week.

364
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,080 
-Really?
-Yeah.

365
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,200 
-You're even yet to ground into Byron.
-Yeah.

366
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,960 
Have you made any friends?

367
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,000 
-I have made some friends.
-Who?

368
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,600 
Jess and Lauren.

369
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,920 
I would love to bring Jess and Hannah
back together again.

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,160 
They've been friends now for years.

371
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,800 
I seen that there was something going on
at the party with Jess.

372
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,320 
-We're good now.
-You good?

373
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,840 
Because I was speaking to her and she said
that she was a little bit concerned.

374
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,560 
-Because she's having her launch.
-Yeah.

375
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,960 
-For her collection.
-Yeah.

376
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,080 
And she didn't feel
when she spoke with you at the party

377
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,880 
that your apology was genuine and sincere.

378
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,960 
And she was a little bit worried.

379
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,720 
She doesn't want anything
to go down at the event

380
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,400 
'cause she's working so hard on it.

381
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,720 
<i>Shit. I really hope</i>
<i>that I haven't upset my new friend.</i>

382
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,680 
I just want you guys to, you know,
sort out whatever it is.

383
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,320 
If she thinks
I'm going to mess it up, then…

384
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,800 
That shocks me a little.

385
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,440 
Because, in my mind,
it was all said and done and cleared.

386
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,960 
I literally thought we were fine.

387
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,120 
Jess' event, I've got to say…

388
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,240 
I don't know
if I'm going to rock up. Who knows?

389
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,840 
So, guys. Not to put pressure on you,
but this is my first catwalk ever.

390
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,000 
For my brand image,
this is the biggest event I've ever done.

391
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,960 
So I just want to make sure
it all goes really smooth.

392
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,160 
You guys look amazing.

393
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,520 
It's going to be amazing,
but just don't fall in the fucking pool.

394
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,640 
Please don't fall in the fucking pool.

395
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,720 
Everything needs to run smoothly

396
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,440 
because there's a lot
of important people coming to the event.

397
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,640 
Pose. Yeah.

398
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,200 
I have some of my best customers coming.

399
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,600 
Some amazing influencers
are going to be there as well.

400
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,320 
So there's a lot of pressure.

401
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,440 
Let the guests arrive.

402
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,840 
-I'm so nervous.
-It's gonna be so good, Jess.

403
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,720
{\an8}-Is Hannah coming?
-Hannah?

404
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,560
{\an8}-Yeah.
-I don't know.

405
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,360 
-Who knows?
-Did you invite her?

406
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,800 
I did. But I just want her
to be on her best behavior.

407
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,840 
I just don't want her doing anything
that takes it away from the show.

408
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,440 
Oh, my gosh. You look amazing.

409
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,120 
-How are you?
-I'm good.

410
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,080 
How are you, fella?

411
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,640 
Good to see you.

412
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,320 
-Good to see you.
-You too.

413
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,800 
-Oh, my gosh. Look at you!
-How are we?

414
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,520 
How are you?

415
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,760 
Hello!

416
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,240 
You look beautiful.

417
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,960 
-Thanks. So do you.
-I love this.

418
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,320 
Look at us.
We're kinda twinning here, aren't we?

419
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,120 
Hi! How you going?

420
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,480
{\an8}Saskia and her partner Frimmy,
they're such a vibe.

421
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,800
{\an8}What are you showing today?

422
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,280 
We have our staples range,
our new collection.

423
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,520 
It's kind of a combination.

424
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,560 
-I'm not like normal brands.
-Into seasons.

425
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,800 
-My God. Not at all.
-Lots of brands are moving away from that.

426
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,040 
Saskia works in fashion as well.

427
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,520 
She works in wholesale.

428
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,160 
She's successful
and I think having Saskia at my event

429
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,960 
could be a business opportunity.

430
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,080 
And it's important to me
that she likes the collection too.

431
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,840 
-Been surfing much?
-Yeah. A little bit.

432
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,840 
-The swell has not stopped.
-It's crazy.

433
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,720 
I've known Frimmy for a long time.

434
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,600 
We grew up in the same area,
surfing the same waves,

435
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,000 
and he's such a nice, genuine dude.

436
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,040 
He's also got a good business head on him.

437
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,040 
-What's your plan?
-We started up a tiny, little airline.

438
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,000 
-No.
-Yeah.

439
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,160 
You're getting a record player on there.
Cocktails on arrival.

440
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,760 
-An old-school vibe.
-Yeah.

441
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600 
-Sick!
-We're gonna make it unique.

442
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,760 
Frimmy's idea to do
a boutique little airline

443
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,680 
connecting Sydney and Byron
is so outrageously cool.

444
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,840 
Frimmy and Saskia are such a power couple.
They're so epic.

445
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,600 
What about you? Are you seeing anyone?

446
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,360 
Yeah, I met this girl called Sarah
at this last little party and I…

447
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,560 
I said I'd show her around,
'cause she's new.

448
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,000 
You're telling the boys about her.

449
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,600 
You're digging yourself in a hole now.

450
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,000 
-Hey--
-It's serious.

451
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,200 
It's serious. It's a heavy energy.

452
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280 
Quick, get it in.

453
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,960 
You're making me nervous, man. Stop it.

454
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,600 
-Hey! How are you?
-Hi!

455
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,720 
-How are you?
-You well, mate?

456
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,600 
-How you doing?
-How are you? Good.

457
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,360 
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

458
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,360 
Thank you.

459
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,920 
Cheers, brother. Good to see ya.

460
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,440 
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

461
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,800 
Cheers to you.

462
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,600 
Nathan and I shared a connection,

463
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,560 
and I'm looking forward
to picking up where we left off.

464
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,800 
-How are you?
-Good.

465
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,960 
How was your weekend?

466
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,080 
Yeah, it was crazy. It was crazy.

467
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,160 
-What about yours?
-Same.

468
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,160 
There are little smirks going on here.

469
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,840 
Thank you for making it awkward.

470
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,400 
-I love you.
-I like it.

471
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960 
Sarah's cute. She's a lot of fun.

472
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,440 
I get a bit lost for words.
The heart starts racing.

473
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,400 
I don't know. It's hard to speak
when your heart's running at 200 BPM.

474
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,600 
Just a couple more of these
and then it'll all be all right.

475
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,360 
Stop it.

476
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,800 
This is an outfit.

477
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,840 
-It's kind of a bit loud.
-Isn't it?

478
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,840 
Yeah. It's great.

479
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,000 
I'm not in Byron just for the acai bowls.

480
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,720 
I'm here to find hot, talented people.

481
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,120 
Fashion attracts creatives.

482
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,880 
-I'm glad you're in color.
-Yeah.

483
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,480 
I thought, "Everyone's in black.
It's a funeral."

484
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,840 
Hello. I'm Saskia.

485
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,520 
What about Nathan?

486
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,000 
What about him?

487
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,440 
Well, how did your date go?

488
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,640 
It was really good.

489
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,760 
And he was like…
We were just having a good time.

490
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,680 
Yeah?

491
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,040 
And it was a picnic on the beach.

492
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,200 
Was it like a David Jones hamper or like…

493
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,840 
No. He handmade
vegan rice paper rolls for me.

494
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,440 
-Shit.
-And he brought the dog.

495
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,120 
But since I got here, I feel like…

496
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,640 
I don't know. There's a weird vibe.

497
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,960 
There's a weird vibe?

498
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,000 
Either he's trying to be cool
or he's like, "I don't like this girl."

499
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,640 
'Cause it's weird.

500
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:57,680 
Nathan's kind of talking to everyone
and not really talking to me.

501
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,320 
And just acting a little weird.

502
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,600 
Since I moved to Byron,
he's one of the few people

503
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,040 
that made me feel really
comfortable, really quickly.

504
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,600 
So I'm feeling a little bit disappointed.

505
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840 
That's cool.

506
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,840 
-Hi!
-Hey.

507
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,200 
Look who's here.

508
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,120 
Hello.

509
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,280 
-Hey.
-Hey.

510
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,760 
-Hi.
-How are you?

511
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,320 
Hello.

512
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,720 
It's better late than never.

513
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,040 
Welcome.

514
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,760 
Hello!

515
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,560 
How are you?

516
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,720 
-Hi.
-Oh, my God. Go say hi.

517
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,280 
-Hello. How are you?
-How are you?

518
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,080 
I will definitely freak out
if she tries to bring drama into my event.

519
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,520 
Last but definitely not least.

520
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,000 
-Hello.
-Hello.

521
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,800 
-I'm like, "You're last?"
-No.

522
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880 
-How are you?
-You look beautiful.

523
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,000 
Nice to see you. Thanks for coming.

524
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,560 
I got something for you.

525
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,520 
You got something for me?

526
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,840 
-Just a little something.
-What have you got?

527
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,800 
"Sisters who slay together stay together."

528
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,400 
That's very…

529
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,840 
What…

530
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,880 
Is that us? Which are you?

531
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,400 
-It's Kylie and Kendall.
-I know.

532
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,600 
Which do you wanna be?

533
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,760 
"My beautiful Jessica,
I'm so beyond proud of you."

534
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,920 
"I'm sorry. I love you."

535
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,480 
That's nice.

536
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,760 
Thank you. I appreciate that.

537
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,040 
I appreciate you coming
and supporting me as well.

538
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,960 
I have always been
one of Jess' biggest fans from the start.

539
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040 
I've always been so proud of her.

540
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,520 
It's so great
that our friendship's back again.

541
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,480 
-How've you been? Been good?
-Yeah.

542
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,040 
I'm happy giving Hannah
the benefit of the doubt.

543
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,560 
And now that we are friends,
we can move forward.

544
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,360 
Okay. Maybe.

545
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,680 
Looks like Jess and Hannah
are good friends again.

546
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,160 
Success.

547
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,120 
-How'd you find your party? You enjoy it?
-Yeah.

548
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,240 
Well, my friend overheard two people

549
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,520 
that are "new" to our scene,
Alex and Sarah,

550
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,840 
call my family and I… It's pretty heavy.

551
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,120 
<i>The Handmaid's Tale.</i>

552
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,240 
As in, relating my family and I to that.

553
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,480 
To a cult.

554
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,840 
-Pretty much.
-Yeah.

555
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,920 
Oh, my God, look at them.

556
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,640 
Like something from <i>The Handmaid's Tale.</i>

557
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,800 
-I don't think I can do this.
-What?

558
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,440 
See you. Bye, babe.

559
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,800 
-It's pretty--
-Disrespectful.

560
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,360 
Like, majorly.

561
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,600 
-And also…
-You know he's here?

562
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,480 
-Yeah. I know.
-Yeah. He's here.

563
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,360 
Are you gonna say something to him?

564
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,080 
I think I have to.

565
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,560 
Just don't smash glasses.
I've heard he's a bit sassy.

566
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640 
Fucking good luck.

567
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,600 
Thanks, sweetie.

568
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,880 
Thank you for today.

569
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,520 
-You look stunning.
-Thank you.

570
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,240 
Bye.

571
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,440 
I think I'm losing it.

572
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,440 
I guess, as the newbie at the party,

573
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,080 
I found myself spending
quite a bit of time on my own.

574
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,240 
It's been pretty lonely.

575
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,400 
Nathan is completely ignoring me.

576
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,640 
It's just left me feeling really confused.

577
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,560 
I think I've got him all wrong.

578
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,480 
Maybe he's a player.

579
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,960 
At this point,
I'm just going to brush it off.

580
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,080 
I just want to have a good day
and get to know everyone else.

581
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,600 
-Hi! How are you?
-Good to see you.

582
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,960 
-It's been a minute.
-Good to see you. I know.

583
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,720 
I hope I'm not interrupting.

584
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,880 
No. We're just talking about dubstep.

585
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120 
-Dubstep!
-Yeah. Big fans.

586
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,920 
-How's your week been?
-Good. Thank you.

587
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,240 
I'm leaving. So…

588
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,880 
-Gonna go talk to Jess?
-Yeah.

589
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,800 
About the event?

590
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,960 
Maybe. I might go for a wander around.

591
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,920 
I'm gonna go join him.

592
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,960 
Everyone's leaving.

593
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,760 
-Hey.
-Hey.

594
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,520 
-Everybody left us. So rude.
-Yeah. I know.

595
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,320 
-How dare they?
-It's fine. I'm not mad about it.

596
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,160 
I won't be offended
if you relocate to the buffet.

597
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,240 
I'm a patient man.

598
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,760 
-Do you want to go eat?
-No.

599
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,400 
-Are you sure? Okay.
-It's waiting for me. It's all good.

600
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,800 
Are you a seafood fan?

601
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,920 
No. I'm mostly plant-based now. So…

602
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,960 
Yeah. I could never get around oysters.

603
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,880 
I can put them in my mouth,
I just can't swallow them.

604
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,400 
That's a bad position to be in.

605
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,920 
You know.

606
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,200 
Have you had a chance to see Byron yet?
Have a look around?

607
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,760 
-Seen the sights?
-Not really.

608
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,160 
A little bit. But not really.

609
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,040 
That's a shame. We should do something.

610
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,640 
-Show you around?
-Yeah.

611
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,720 
Yeah. Pinky swear.

612
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,040 
Now it's sealed.

613
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,800 
<i>Nathan is completely ignoring me,</i>

614
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,120 
<i>and Elias wants to hang out,</i>
<i>and I'm so confused.</i>

615
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,880 
-Everyone's coming.
-What's going on here?

616
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,520 
-Sarah!
-Hi!

617
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,880 
-Hi.
-How are you?

618
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,320 
You look so good.

619
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,560 
You look so good. You look beautiful.

620
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,080 
Elle and Nathan are flatmates,
so they're really close.

621
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,040 
And hopefully Elle can help me
figure out what to do now.

622
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,640 
Well, what do you think?

623
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,200 
Because you know Nathan.
I don't know Nathan.

624
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,360 
So you just…

625
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,480 
Why not just explore both?

626
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,160 
-There's no reason why--
-Is that rude? Is that…

627
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,440 
Look, they are friends,
but you're just going out as friends.

628
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,040 
-So it doesn't really matter.
-Okay.

629
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,000 
I think that Sarah and Elias
might be a bit better of a match

630
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,560 
than Sarah and Nathan.

631
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,520 
For Nathan to be truly into someone,
they've got to be the whole package.

632
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,160 
I mean, it's way too early
to just decline a date from another party.

633
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,920 
Your date with Nathan was very low-key.

634
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,840 
It was low-key.

635
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,520 
It was probably 20% more romantic
than I thought it was going to be,

636
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,680 
maybe 50%, but it was still low-key.
It was in the daytime.

637
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,080 
I wasn't wearing heels,
so I don't think that counts.

638
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,080 
It's not a date
if you're not wearing heels.

639
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,760 
And I was wearing underpants.

640
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,640 
What the fuck just came out of your mouth?

641
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,080 
Honestly, who says that?

642
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,760 
Is that how you identify a date?

643
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,880 
Yeah. If you're wearing heels
and no undies, it's a date.

644
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,600 
Oh, my God. What the fuck am I saying?

645
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,640 
Okay.

646
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,960 
That comment was totally trashy,
so Gold Coast.

647
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,280 
Yeah. I'm going to go hang out
and do some more networking.

648
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,000 
-More networking?
-Yeah.

649
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,160 
When I get really nervous and excited,
I act really weird.

650
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,760 
What else could possibly go wrong?

651
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,560 
-Hi.
-Hi!

652
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,200 
-How are you?
-I'm so good. How are you both?

653
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,000 
-Very well. Thank you.
-Good.

654
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,320 
So I wanted to talk to you guys
about something.

655
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,240 
This is a reference to the show
<i>The Handmaid's Tale.</i>

656
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,800 
-Yes.
-Someone said something about my family.

657
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,520 
Are you saying
that we're like the wealthy people

658
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,160 
getting other people
to have children for us?

659
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,120 
Or am I the other person that's meant
to be giving birth to these other people?

660
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,800 
No. You were the celebrated child.

661
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,680 
When you were standing there,
your parents right next to you,

662
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,160 
it was very dramatic.

663
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240 
-So it was a good thing?
-Yeah. Totally.

664
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,720 
I'm making a pretty weak attempt
to dance myself out of this situation,

665
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,720 
but it's working!

666
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,520 
Felt like the light was hitting you
on a certain angle.

667
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,000 
-Right.
-It was very poetic.

668
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,560 
Okay. Well, good.

669
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,840 
I think the show's about to start,
so let's just…

670
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,360 
You guys are so great.

671
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,639 
Stop it!

672
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,520 
Guys, I'm so excited for this day.

673
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,400 
Obviously, this has been
a lot of pressure for me,

674
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,840 
and I'm super nervous, but I'm so excited
to spend it with you all.

675
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,400 
My new friends, my old friends.

676
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,520 
This has been six years in the making.
This day is super important to me.

677
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,840 
So cheers, guys.
Thank you so much. I'm excited.

678
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,360 
Enjoy. Okay?

679
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,040 
Cheer them on.

680
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,760 
"Six years in the making"?

681
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,840 
It takes six years to do a fashion line?

682
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,679 
Go.

683
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,800 
It better be amazing.

684
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,320 
Work it, baby. Yes.

685
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,520 
You go.

686
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,600 
<i>This catwalk is a bit of</i>
<i>a make-or-break situation.</i>

687
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,040 
<i>A lot of influencers are here.</i>

688
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120 
Quick.

689
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,160 
<i>Jade has got such a massive following.</i>

690
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,360 
<i>His Instagram blows up</i>
<i>every time he posts.</i>

691
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,280 
Gorgeous.

692
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,120 
<i>So I need to represent</i>
<i>the brand perfectly.</i>

693
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,720 
Sick. This coat.

694
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,920 
I have that jacket.

695
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,800 
What do you think?

696
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,040 
Yeah, girl.

697
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,560 
It's progressive for Byron Bay.

698
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,960 
"Progressive for Byron Bay"?
It's neutral colors.

699
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,640 
It's neutral colors
wrap-tied around a body, darl.

700
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,680 
Gorgeous.

701
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,040 
Yes.

702
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,320 
Yes.

703
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,520 
That's a good vibe. That's cute.

704
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600 
It's very <i>Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

705
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,520 
I'd wear that.

706
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,640 
-Would you?
-Yeah.

707
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,640 
The hard work that Jess is putting in,

708
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,080 
I can see that she will take it
to the next level. That's for sure.

709
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,800 
I can see it being a global brand.

710
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,040 
Come on, right?

711
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,080 
Yes, queen!

712
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,480 
You killed it, Jess!

713
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,320 
Would that take you six years?

714
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,080 
Darl, that will take me
a trip to Spotlight, I think.

715
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,520 
Alex has a bit of bite to him,
that's for sure.

716
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,240 
I was really shocked.

717
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,120 
-Get it, Jess. Get it.
-Congrats!

718
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,360 
-Thank you so much.
-Well done!

719
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,200 
-That was beautiful.
-Thank you.

720
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,600 
-Did you guys like it?
-I loved it.

721
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,120 
-Thank you.
-Jess, that was amazing.

722
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640 
Thank you so much. Thank you.

723
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,560 
This is 100% a proud friend moment.

724
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,560 
She nailed it. And I'm gonna have
to tell everyone on my Instagram.

725
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,160 
These are for you.

726
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,680 
-Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
-I know.

727
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,960 
I'm so excited for you.

728
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,360 
-Jade, that is so sweet.
-Babe.

729
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,640 
Thank you so much.

730
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,840 
Do you guys know Jade?

731
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,360 
I met him at the party.

732
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,000 
Jade says he's the most
followed man in Australia.

733
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,480 
Don't think that's true.

734
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,720 
-Yeah. Right.
-Yeah.

735
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,320 
Yeah. He's a honey.

736
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,040 
He's an interesting character.

737
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,760 
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Very interesting character.

738
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,400 
No. He is interesting because how he comes
across on social media is not actually…

739
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,240 
I don't know. He's such a sensitive soul.

740
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,520 
-You know what I mean?
-Interesting.

741
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,360 
I know Jade from Instagram.

742
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,720 
I finally followed him.

743
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,120 
His content's quite funny.

744
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,000 
In the influencer world,
everyone's suspicious of everyone.

745
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,040 
Is this whole place
just one big town filled with lies?

746
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,760 
Potentially.

747
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,520 
After the Johansen launch event,
I feel like a bit of an outsider.

748
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,080 
So I'm so excited
to take Elias up on his offer

749
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,280 
to just hang out
and get to know each other a bit better.

750
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,120 
How are ya?

751
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,440 
-How's it going?
-Hi.

752
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,720 
-Good. How are you?
-Good.

753
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,160 
-Gonna have a sit? Go for it.
-Yeah. If I can steal some towel.

754
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,000 
How's it been?

755
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,560 
-It's been hard, dude.
-Why?

756
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,160 
-Just felt like a little bit…
-Just really…

757
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,160 
Do you know what? I honestly thought
I'd come here and make heaps of friends

758
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,040 
and have a little community and stuff.
But it just hasn't been like that.

759
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,840 
Everyone's real funny towards outsiders.

760
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,160 
It can be super cliquey.

761
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,080 
It's always hard moving to a new place,
on your own especially.

762
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,040 
-You don't know anyone.
-Yeah. I don't know anyone.

763
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,960 
It's just been really hard
and I feel like I'm alone a lot.

764
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,040 
Yeah. Sorry.

765
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,600 
It's horrible
when you're trying to find friends

766
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,920 
and people that you can connect with

767
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,040 
in a place that you're trying
to make your home.

768
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,960 
I know how that feels. Yeah, it's not fun.

769
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,640 
You've been hanging out
with Nathan. What's the vibe there?

770
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,680 
Yeah. I don't know.

771
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,800 
When we hung out, he kind of seemed like…

772
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,000 
I don't know. Like there's
a little bit more substance to him

773
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,720 
and he's got a softer side and whatever.

774
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,040 
-Yeah.
-And then at the launch…

775
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,120 
-That's exactly it.
-Like two completely different people

776
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,680 
when he's around everyone
and when he's one-on-one.

777
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,240 
I don't know which version
is the right Nathan, I guess.

778
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,680 
Exactly. That's exactly the same
kind of journey I've had with him.

779
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,800 
Met him at a party.

780
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,000 
And then later on, went for a few surfs.
A couple one-on-one things.

781
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,360 
Like, "This guy's actually cool. I think
I vibe him. Maybe we're becoming mates."

782
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,720 
But then we hung out a couple times
in social settings.

783
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,680 
I was like, "This guy's not my cup
of tea. He's just a party boy."

784
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,880 
-Really?
-Like superficial friends.

785
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,960 
Someone you only go so deep with.
Then there's not really much more there.

786
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,240 
So do you think he's a player then?

787
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,480 
He doesn't really hide that.

788
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,080 
Maybe he has to you.

789
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,360 
But with the boys, he doesn't hide that.

790
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,080 
Do you think he's a fuckboy?

791
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,040 
Yeah. You're pretty bang on.

792
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,920 
I'm not gonna lie on his behalf.

793
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,200 
I'm not part of that lie.
It's got nothing to do with me.

794
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,160 
Sarah had already shown
she was vulnerable.

795
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,880 
It's impossible for me to say,
"He's a great guy."

796
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,440 
And then he goes and fucks you over.

797
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,040 
And you go,
"Why didn't anyone say that to me?"

798
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,680 
It's like… I'm not gonna
back up anyone like that.

799
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,560 
I'm here for you, mate. Come here.

800
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280 
That's so sweet.

801
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,320 
That's really sweet. Thank you.

802
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,600 
Hearing Elias' warnings about Nathan
make me feel betrayed

803
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,880 
because I thought we had a connection.

804
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,600 
Elias is a really down-to-earth guy,

805
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,480 
and he might actually
really care about me.
