1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,120 
<i>All right, ladies,</i>
<i>so coming into down stretch position,</i>

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,760 
so just draw your hips forward. That's it.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,360 
Good. Last one.

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,680 
So nice, ladies. All done.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,960 
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,000 
-I'll see you next time. Thanks, ladies.
-Thanks so much.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,720 
God, my arms are shaking.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,640 
That last exercise kinda got me.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,160 
You guys are too good for me to be
doing this with you. I need new friends.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,640 
But I needed that. I needed that today.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,520 
-But how are you? Yeah?
-I'm good. I'm really good.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,720 
But I heard so much happened
at the Spirit Night with Simba.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,040 
Elle didn't make it
to Simba's Spirit Night.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,920 
She missed a lot that went down.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,360 
I heard there was a huge blow-up.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,680 
Yup. So Nathan went to confront Elias and…

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,480 
-It went pear-shaped.
-Oh, my God.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,040 
Elle's quite protective of Nathan.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,120 
They live together,
they've been good friends for ages.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,040 
He was, like, boiling point.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,360 
It must've really got to him.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,080 
And look, Nathan and Elias
have been friends for a very long time.

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,840 
So their friendship was solid
prior to Sarah coming to town.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,440 
To me, I think Sarah needs
to really take the reins on it.

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,640 
Yeah.

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,760 
Nathan feels like family to me.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,520 
And I just think there's unnecessary
drama going on because of Sarah.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,400 
Do you think she's doing it for attention?

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,800 
Do you think she loves the drama?

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,480 
I'm genuinely confused
about who she is as a person.

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,480 
-And that's been my thought from day one.
-Yeah.

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,440 
Such a shame that you weren't there, but,
what have you been up to?

33
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,480 
I've just been absolutely under the pump
to deliver this epic fundraiser

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,840 
for Beyond Coral
ocean restoration foundation.

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,440 
I don't know if you saw,
I posted a photo of me being a mermaid.

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,120 
<i>Yeah, I did see that.</i>

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,280 
I'm gonna have
a sculpture of me on display

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,880 
as a mermaid.

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,560 
Why didn't I think
about a sculpture of myself at my event?

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,440 
There is not one person I know

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,920 
that could pull off being a mermaid,
other than yourself, Elle.

42
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,560 
-She'll be Queen Elle. We'll stand around.
-Queen Elle, the mermaid.

43
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,440 
I guess you could say I naturally have
people and tribes gravitate towards me.

44
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,080 
And being a leader in this community,
I'm hoping to inspire people.

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,880 
It's gonna be such a cool mix of people
going to the event.

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,040 
So obviously you girls, the whole crew.

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,320 
-So Alex, Sarah…
-You are going to invite Sarah?

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680 
Yeah, look, I am.

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,440 
I think there's so much power
in being the bigger person,

50
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,880 
and putting your own issues aside
for the greater good,

51
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,000 
which is to save the oceans.

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,520 
But at the same time,
if Sarah causes a stir at my fundraiser,

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,200 
I will definitely pull her into line.

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,720
{\an8}Since moving to Byron,
I've certainly felt like an outsider.

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,200 
But I'm not gonna take
this bullshit anymore.

56
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,960 
-Hi.
-Hey. There she is.

57
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,480 
I'm really enjoying
hanging out with Nathan.

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,520 
There's a natural connection,
and I hope he feels the same way.

59
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,160 
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you for inviting me.

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,040 
It's been a minute since we hung out.

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,600 
After being called a fuckboy,
and all the drama that happened,

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,480 
I'm super keen to
put all the bullshit behind us

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,320 
and just move on
in the direction that we left off on.

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,240 
The day that we hung out,
it was so good, so sweet.

65
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,280 
I had heaps of fun. I was like, "Sweet."

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,280 
"I think we're onto something,
that we're gonna hang out a bit more,"

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,560 
but it just turned
into a shit show for a while.

68
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,600 
But it's really nice that you came.
You look beautiful, honestly.

69
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,760 
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

70
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,600 
It's really nice
to have some one-on-one time.

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,040 
-I was really nervous actually.
-Really? Why?

72
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,360 
I don't know.

73
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,000 
Just 'cause we haven't hung out,
then all the stuff happened.

74
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,279 
It's the first time
that we actually get to sit down and talk

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240 
without anyone else around.

76
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320 
Yeah.

77
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,480 
I appreciate that you got to know me
and we could hang out,

78
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,200 
and you didn't listen
to everybody else's bullshit.

79
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,600 
'Cause that happens a lot.

80
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,880 
I completely understand,
and it's happened to me as well, you know?

81
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,120 
All of the gossip and rumors
that I heard about Nathan,

82
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,440 
I'm just not paying any attention to it.

83
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,840 
You cannot win, hey.

84
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,760 
Hannah told me that
some girls were saying shit about me.

85
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,200 
That I'm fake and I don't fit in.

86
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,360 
Honestly, there's been a few times
where people have put things in my head.

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,760 
Was it Elle? Just tell me.

88
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,960 
Because I've heard after Cai's exhibition,

89
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,760 
Elle was saying some pretty, like,

90
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,400 
not that nice things about me.

91
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,840 
I feel like you just answered
your own question.

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,200 
Nathan has confirmed that
Elle is going around saying that I'm fake.

93
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,680 
I've been nothing but nice to Elle,
so it hurts a little bit.

94
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,560 
But the last thing I wanted
was to let it ruin the date.

95
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,520 
We should stop talking about serious stuff
and just do some shots.

96
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800 
You want some shots?

97
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,800 
-We're at a tequila bar.
-I have to agree with that.

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,480 
Can we get two tequila shots?

99
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,240 
-Thank you. I can smell it. It's strong.
-Thank so much.

100
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,840 
-Cheers.
-That eye contact.

101
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,800 
You gotta…

102
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,240 
No, it's fun. That was good.

103
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,520 
Your necklace is tangled.

104
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,400 
-Hold on.
-Thank you.

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,360 
-Thank you.
-I think it's the other side.

106
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,800 
-Okay.
-Hold on.

107
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,120 
It was tangled.

108
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,240 
-Did you get it? Thank you.
-Yeah, I got it.

109
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,080 
I don't know if that's his move.

110
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,000 
But it kind of works
because it left me wanting more.

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680 
Honestly, thanks for coming.
It was really nice.

112
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,720 
Tastes like margaritas.

113
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,160 
-How's things?
-Obviously, Nathan, everything he said.

114
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,320 
-He rubbed me up the wrong way.
-Yeah.

115
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,080 
I've got a true opinion of you in my head.

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160 
I think you're an egotistical fuck.

117
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,800 
And I also think that you are
seriously, seriously insecure.

118
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,280 
No doubt, it upset me.

119
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,280 
He feels hurt,
apparently about the fuckboy comment.

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,480 
But he made some really low blows.

121
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,880 
When Nathan came at me
with that final line,

122
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,800 
"You're an egotistical, insecure fuck,"

123
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,520 
it was like, "That's you, mate.
That is literally you to a tee."

124
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,200 
Shut the fuck up.

125
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,000 
So what do you wanna do?
What are you thinking?

126
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,440 
I'm gonna wait,
bide my time, and get him one-on-one.

127
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,720 
That how I need to speak to him.
One-on-one.

128
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,280 
I think that's a good way
of looking at it because

129
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,240 
you don't want him
to be in that space of ego and persona.

130
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,200 
You wanna get him exactly
where he is closer to his authenticity

131
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360 
and confront him then, because I feel like
he'll just try to trigger you

132
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440 
and not listen to what you're saying.

133
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,680 
Yeah, 'cause at the end of the day,
I can control myself.

134
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,880 
-I don't know if he can.
-Yeah.

135
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,880 
It's gone beyond rivalry.

136
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,600 
I just wanna to have
man-to-man conversation with Nathan

137
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,280 
and knock this out.

138
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,880 
I just need to be ready to fight back.

139
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360 
Let's go hard.

140
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,799 
Oh, my God. You look amazing.

141
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,080 
Yeah. Surprise.

142
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,360 
Honestly, you look phenomenal.

143
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,880 
I'm so glad
that I've grown my hair this long

144
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,720 
'cause I look like a legit mermaid.

145
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,560 
Having my partner Stav
back in Byron is great

146
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,720 
because the CHARM fundraiser is fast
approaching and there's so much to do.

147
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,240 
We're about to turn you
into a sculpture now.

148
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,760 
-Perfect. Let's do it.
-Perfect.

149
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,600 
Ready, don't move. I'm gonna scan you.

150
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,040 
It's gonna take about
30 seconds to a minute.

151
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,120 
CHARM is our ocean conservation project,

152
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,120 
and the scans that Stav is taking today

153
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,880 
will be used to turn me
into a life-size mermaid sculpture.

154
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,680 
Me being scanned as a mermaid
will bring about more conscious attention

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600 
to saving our coral reefs.

156
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,960 
I just finished it up.

157
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,960
{\an8}-All right.
-Wow. That is so cool.

158
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,600 
Can you make my boobs bigger?

159
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,320 
-Yes, we can do anything.
-Okay, good.

160
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,040 
So many people all over the world
refer to me as sunshine.

161
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,240 
I can help shift the consciousness
of people all around me.

162
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,800 
I feel like a real-life Wonder Woman.

163
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,960 
That's what Stav calls me.

164
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,960 
You're an absolute weapon
in the business world.

165
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,560 
And you're a weapon
in the engineering world.

166
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,600 
I think with our powers combined,

167
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,880 
there's so much great
we can do in the world.

168
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,640 
And starting with the oceans,
that's just the tip of the iceberg.

169
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,840 
There are a lot of important people
coming to my fundraiser.

170
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,160 
Nothing is going to crush my day.
I think that it's gonna be a great event.

171
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,520 
Cai is probably
the only person left on the planet

172
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,280 
that at this age, its normal to have
a Slip 'N Slide at your house.

173
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,480 
We're grown-arse men.
Far out. That thing was fun.

174
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,480 
Oh, my God.

175
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,280 
Man, it hurts a little bit.

176
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360 
-It's dangerous but that's how I like it.
-Yeah.

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,920
{\an8}I mean, when you have a hill like this,
you gotta use it.

178
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,480 
A lot's happened with you.
You went on a date last night.

179
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,160 
-How do you know that?
-Little birdies told me.

180
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,480 
-Word goes too fast.
-I'm a man about town. What can I say?

181
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,000 
Yeah. Sarah and I went on a little,
I guess you can call it a date.

182
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,160 
So what happened? Come on. Fill me in.

183
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,480 
You're glowing a little bit. Like…

184
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,560 
-Did you kiss?
-Yeah, we kissed.

185
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000 
-Really?
-We kissed.

186
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,200 
My man had it in him. Okay.

187
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,720 
That's good, man. I'm happy for you.

188
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,400 
So how do you feel about Sarah now?
Are you moving forward with this?

189
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,280 
She's actually a great girl,
and, in a way, I care for her

190
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,720 
because I feel sorry for her
that she's being judged,

191
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,200 
and then on the other side,
Elle's really protective over me.

192
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,520 
And I can tell
that she's just like, "Nah."

193
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,680 
From what Nathan has told me about Elle,
it sounds like she's got a crush on him.

194
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,600 
And I think Elle's a little bit jealous
of Sarah taking up all Nathan's time.

195
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,160 
All this stuff with Elle, does that mean
you're not gonna bring Sarah home?

196
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,680 
Elle's pinging crystals at her.

197
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,320 
-Sarah's sonic voicing her.
-"Eat quartz!"

198
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,000 
We can write a comic book about this.

199
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,040 
Oh, God.

200
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,360 
I'm definitely in a bit of a hard place

201
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,600 
with Elle not liking Sarah,
and Elle being my housemate.

202
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,720 
It's definitely making things difficult.

203
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800 
So how was all that
fire action the other night?

204
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,480 
Yeah, mate.
That kind of got out of hand a bit.

205
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,640 
Elias and I aren't
really good at the moment.

206
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,960 
I thought you and Elias
were not that type of friendship

207
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,760 
for him to throw you under the bus.

208
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,400 
-What he said.
-You'd think so, right?

209
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,360 
Elias has just completely
disregarded my feelings,

210
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440 
calling me a fuckboy and all of that.

211
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,280 
But things are going well
between Sarah and I.

212
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,800 
So fuck him. I don't care anymore.

213
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,160 
I bet you can't go all the way
from the top on the board.

214
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,640 
-Standing up?
-Yeah.

215
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,120 
-All right.
-Let's do it.

216
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000 
Yay! That looks cute.

217
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,920 
-Yay! Let me see.
-Yeah.

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,400 
These are cute.

219
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,080 
-What about you send a couple to Nathan?
-I should 'cause we went out.

220
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,840 
-Did you know we went out?
-Did you?

221
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,840 
-Like a real, proper date?
-Yeah.

222
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,120 
Did you pash or anything?

223
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,480 
Oh, my God. You did!

224
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,840 
I literally have not stopped
thinking about him.

225
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,600 
He must've done something right.

226
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,400 
-Did you go back to Nathan's place?
-It was the first date.

227
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,600 
I wasn't gonna go back to his place.
No, I was a good girl.

228
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,640 
-But he lives with Elle, doesn't he?
-Yeah.

229
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,440 
So you couldn't go back to his place.

230
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,720 
Yeah, it would've been awkward.
That's a massive roadblock.

231
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,800 
She posts all over Instagram
about being a spiritual warrior,

232
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,440 
woman connected to the earth
and full of crystals. A bunch of shit.

233
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,400 
-Yeah.
-Take a mirror, girl.

234
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,440 
<i>Elle has nothing nice to say about me.</i>

235
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,040 
<i>And Nathan told me she's called me fake</i>
<i>and I don't know why.</i>

236
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,480 
I think that's Saskia and Frimmy
up on a horse.

237
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,280 
-You can smell the wealth, can't you?
-I'm not into it.

238
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,320 
<i>I knew Byron was a small town,</i>
<i>but you can't go anywhere</i>

239
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,160 
<i>without seeing somebody you know</i>
<i>and it sucks.</i>

240
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,760 
-Hey, guys.
-Hello.

241
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,920 
-Howdy.
-Hi.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,120 
As much as I don't
wanna see Sarah right now,

243
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,160 
it is one good opportunity
for Sarah to take responsibility

244
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,640 
for what's happened
between her, Elias and Nathan.

245
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,440 
What have you been up to? What's new?

246
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,160 
After Simba's the other day,
how did that play out with the two boys?

247
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,640 
I know how Nathan feels
about the situation,

248
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,400 
'cause I went on a date with him.

249
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,240 
We had a good chat about everything.

250
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,360 
-You went on a date with him?
-A date?

251
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,160 
He and I get on really well
and it's just super easy.

252
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,760 
We just ended up drinking tequila
and having D&Ms all night.

253
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,760
{\an8}But you like Elias as well.

254
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,480 
Yeah. The whole thing that started off was

255
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,400 
I wanted to make friends
and get to know people.

256
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,960 
Doesn't it make you feel
like you shouldn't maybe see Elias

257
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,280 
if that's gonna cause
spanner in the works?

258
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,520 
I don't know why she's doing this
to two guys who are meant to be friends.

259
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720 
I think it's immature.

260
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,200 
I think she should be
addressing it herself.

261
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,680 
You gotta stop causing beef
between two guys.

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,960 
Hey, but you're not causing the beef.

263
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,200 
-No.
-They have beef between themselves.

264
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,680 
You are, without trying to.

265
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,840 
Byron's a pretty macho place.

266
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,280 
It's pretty small place,

267
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,160 
and so you don't wanna jump
on everyone's toes.

268
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,600 
I feel bad for the fight
between Nathan and Elias,

269
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,440 
but Saskia's attitude towards me
is so unfair.

270
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,320 
And I'm sick of being judged.

271
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,200 
All right. Good luck with the horses.

272
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,920 
-Thanks.
-We'll leave you to your horsy ride.

273
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,600 
-Bye.
-Bye, guys.

274
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,800 
What the actual fuck?

275
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,800 
I don't know where Saskia's coming from.

276
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,880 
Why's it Sarah's responsibility to resolve
a conflict between Elias and Nathan?

277
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,040 
They're two grown-arse men.
Work it out yourselves.

278
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,120 
So many things that they just said,
they were so judgy.

279
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,440 
As if, like, "You've just come here.
You've caused all this drama."

280
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,160 
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

281
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,760 
What did I do?

282
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,440 
I would never accost somebody on the beach

283
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,160 
on a literal and figurative high horse

284
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,760 
and start questioning
their motives and character.

285
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,880 
And if this is
what they're saying to my face,

286
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,440 
I can only imagine
what they're saying behind my back.

287
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,360 
Okay, so I think that we should do
a silk set in this fabric.

288
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,840 
-You love it, don't you?
-Yeah.

289
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,120 
I'm obsessed with this.

290
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,760 
I'm so excited I'm doing
a collaboration collection with Jade.

291
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,400 
Jade doesn't really know
a lot about designing,

292
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,240 
but he has the following
and that's all that matters.

293
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,359 
We could do color
if you wanted to, on a T-shirt,

294
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,160 
'cause guys wear colorful T-shirts.

295
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,400 
-I think we'll leave the color out.
-Yeah.

296
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,319 
We're not going Gold Coast.
You live in Byron Bay now, all right?

297
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,599 
It's a different town.

298
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,760 
A collaboration is where an influencer
comes together with a brand

299
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:35,720 
and they put their own type of spin
on the clothing line.

300
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,240 
This is a dream come true.

301
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,200 
So what's been going on?
How do you feel about Alex?

302
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,680 
He obviously doesn't want
to be my friend, so I'm cool with that.

303
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,840 
Yeah.

304
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,960 
I'm sick and tired of talking about Alex.

305
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,480 
I don't have the energy for it.
I'm not doing it.

306
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,040 
I saw Elle and Saskia the other day

307
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,400 
and we were talking
about Elle's fundraiser.

308
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,760 
Oh, my God. Okay. She's doing
a mermaid sculpture of herself.

309
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,800 
-Hold on.
-Yeah, a lot is happening.

310
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,160 
A sculpture of her as a mermaid?

311
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,560 
-Is that what she's going for?
-I think so.

312
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,960 
That makes more sense.
I thought you meant her as normal person.

313
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,680 
At the door, there's another Elle.

314
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,440 
I really don't know
what Elle does with her charity,

315
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,400 
but having a sculpture of herself
at her event is so fucking extra.

316
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,000 
In my head
I'm just seeing mermaids and robots.

317
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,240 
There's a lot going on right now.
I'm there like, "Get me another drink."

318
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,920 
Let's hope there's alcohol.

319
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,840 
Do you think there's ever been
a robot mermaid party in Byron?

320
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,040 
No, I don't think so.
This is definitely a one-off concept.

321
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,560 
-Here they are.
-Hey.

322
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,240 
-Hey, great to see you.
-Geniuses.

323
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,840 
Hey, this looks amazing.

324
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,200 
So who's in the guest list?

325
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,960 
We've invited, obviously, all of our crew.
Elias is gonna come.

326
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,400 
-Is he?
-Yeah.

327
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,200 
-Have you spoken to him?
-I haven't said anything to him.

328
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,120 
-Is everything good with you guys?
-I don't think so.

329
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,760 
I really hope that Nathan and Elias
can leave their differences aside

330
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,400 
because I can't afford
any issues at my event.

331
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,880 
-Oh, my goodness.
-Hey, guys.

332
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,240 
How are you?

333
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,960 
The community of Byron are very
passionate about environmental issues.

334
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,040 
And there's a lot that's riding
on this fundraiser,

335
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,320 
so it's so important
to really impress these people.

336
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,400 
-Oh, my God, mermaids.
-There's a merman as well.

337
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,680 
Oh, my God, there's a merman.

338
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,360 
-There's a merman.
-Oh, my God.

339
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,880 
This is totally a Byron party.

340
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,200 
This is one of the reasons
why I moved here.

341
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,600 
-He's so hot. Hello.
-Give him a wave.

342
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,920 
Naughty. Naughty boy.

343
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,040 
Here's the troublemaker.

344
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,080 
This is great.

345
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,880 
I love the merman outfits.
They're a real vibe.

346
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,160 
So what is today? Is it a fundraiser?

347
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,600 
We've got CHARM the coral farming robot
here for the first time.

348
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680 
-There's a robot here?
-The robot is here.

349
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,120 
We're also raising awareness about
how we actually rehabilitate the reefs,

350
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,120 
with the mermaid,
which we'll talk about later.

351
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,160 
-Okay, great.
-Yeah.

352
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,000 
It's hypocritical
that Elle's trying to save the ocean

353
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,760 
whilst serving tuna canapes.

354
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,320 
Won't the mermaids get upset?

355
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280 
-Cheers, guys.
-Well done. To CHARM.

356
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,280 
To CHARM. I love the name.

357
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,320 
I'm so excited for Elle's fundraiser,

358
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,800 
but I've kinda figured out
that Elias isn't coming.

359
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,520 
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but I ran into Elias at the gym.

360
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,240 
And look…
I should've probably called you but…

361
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,640 
He just said, briefly,
that he might not come tonight.

362
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640 
He wants to talk to you. One-on-one.

363
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,920 
-About a few situations… I know.
-I'm ready.

364
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,240 
-But away from everyone.
-Absolutely. He hasn't contacted me.

365
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,840 
In his position, I would have
come to the fundraiser, no matter what.

366
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,760 
But if he really thinks he can't control
his anger and aggression that much,

367
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,160 
that just raises another whole issue.

368
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080 
Done.

369
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,360 
-So what's been happening?
-I actually went on a date with Sarah.

370
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,400 
-Do you like her?
-She's cool. She's definitely cool.

371
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640 
-I like her. As in we've connected.
-Yeah.

372
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,960 
-And we get each other.
-That's good.

373
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,840 
-Not everyone has accepted her.
-That's the thing, right?

374
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,440 
I'm not exactly sure
why Elle doesn't like Sarah.

375
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,800 
-She needs to give her a go.
-She does.

376
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,640 
And in some ways, I feel like she doesn't
want to give her a go for whatever reason.

377
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,560 
I think there is a sense of jealousy
from Elle when it comes to Sarah.

378
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,680 
I've heard of one reason in particular.

379
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,680 
But I'm going to try to keep it a secret.

380
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,080 
Oh, my gosh. Dave and I
went horse riding the other day,

381
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,480 
and next minute
I see two stragglers coming up.

382
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,360 
And it's Alex and Sarah.

383
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,520 
And I was like, "Oh."

384
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,560 
Sarah was chatting and she mentioned
that her and Nathan went on a date.

385
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,400 
How do you feel about her?

386
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,920 
Yeah, I was surprised.

387
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,040 
I find it really weird

388
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,000 
that Nathan hasn't told me
he's been on a date with Sarah.

389
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,880 
I mean, Nathan tells me everything.

390
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,360 
He can do better than her.

391
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,720 
I don't know her very well,
that could be me, but anyways…

392
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,320 
I wanna know about what it's for.

393
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,720 
I went swimming in the reef
and it was fine, but I'm not sure.

394
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,920 
Half of the reef is dead
all around the world.

395
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,560 
Really? The Great Barrier Reef?

396
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,120 
-Have you heard of coral bleaching?
-No.

397
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,920 
You haven't heard of coral bleaching?

398
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000 
From people pouring bleach in?

399
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,920 
No.

400
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,280 
Wait, what?

401
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,440 
I'm so sorry, I wanna know. I'm confused.

402
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,880 
I had swam in the coral reef
and it looked beautiful.

403
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,400 
I didn't know it was dying
'cause when I seen it, it looked fine.

404
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,400 
Darling, I really wanna
show you Stav's invention.

405
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,160 
-Coral farming robot. Come with.
-Okay.

406
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,880 
-A coral farming what? Okay.
-Robot.

407
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,520 
It's really important
that the guests understand

408
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,520 
the intention of what we're doing.

409
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,440 
I hope Jade would help spread messages
of social change to his followers.

410
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,480 
So what we've got
basically is an invention

411
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,040 
that can hopefully save the coral reefs.

412
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,360 
-Like this machine here?
-Yeah.

413
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,080 
-Look, there's little corals.
-There's little corals.

414
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,360 
We're growing coral
and we're going to replant it in the reef.

415
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,640 
-Does this regrow the coral?
-Yes.

416
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,600 
I thought this collected something.
Sorry. See, already…

417
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,400 
No, it's okay. So corals are like animals

418
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,960 
and they have sex once a year.

419
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,480 
This machine has sex?

420
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,800 
That's why we call it
"husbandry" technology.

421
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,280 
-Can she help me have sex?
-Potentially.

422
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,720 
There's animals having sex
with this machine right now?

423
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,920 
Not right now. Only one night a year.

424
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200 
Okay.

425
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,960 
Sometimes when people speak smart to me
and I don't know what's going on,

426
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,520 
I just nod and look like I understand,
but really I have no fucking idea.

427
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,280 
Did you pass your 12th?

428
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120 
You did, didn't you?

429
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,680 
Every smart person
that does this have done year 12.

430
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,560 
I didn't do year 12. I missed out.

431
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,320 
-How was your date?
-What date?

432
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,680 
-What date?
-Yeah.

433
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,400 
We saw Alex and Sarah on the beach

434
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,760 
and she, you know, explained to us
that you had a little date night.

435
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,520 
Yeah, no, we went on a little date.
We went to Mexican.

436
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,760 
That's cute.

437
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,520 
Hung out, actually heard her,
where she's been

438
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,960 
and heard her troubles
and her struggle, I guess.

439
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,120 
She's just moved to Byron

440
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,040 
and she doesn't really understand
how all of these friendships work

441
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,560 
and who sits where and like, basically,
the lay of the land.

442
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,800 
I understand where she's coming from.

443
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,120 
She's confused
about who's friends with who.

444
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,360 
But she hasn't given herself
the time of day to explain herself.

445
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,840 
I feel like there's a part of her, which…

446
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,120 
She's still playing two dudes at once,
at the end of the day.

447
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,200 
The really reason I'm defensive
is because of you.

448
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,680 
I'm pissed off because she thinks
that she can cause drama.

449
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,320 
That's not cool.
I don't want to see you like that.

450
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,520 
Saskia is on her mission
when it comes to Sarah.

451
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,120 
Possibly, Elle has gotten in her ear.

452
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,560 
You guys are more wound up
about this than I am.

453
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,920 
-Everyone just have a drink, relax.
-You need to tell me more.

454
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,200 
Cai!

455
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,360 
Yes.

456
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,480 
-Look who he's here with.
-Everybody looks so good.

457
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,640 
I've agreed to go to Elle's fundraiser
for one reason only.

458
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,600 
Elle and Nathan, they're really close.

459
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,000 
So I'm going to try to make an effort
to move past all of our issues

460
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,280 
for the sake of
my relationship with Nathan.

461
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,480 
Hello. Hi, how are you?

462
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,880 
-Hey, beautiful, how are you?
-Hi.

463
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,760 
-How's things?
-Good. How are you?

464
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,040 
I'm great. I'm great.

465
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,840 
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

466
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,320 
-Hello, Sarah. Stephen.
-Hi. Hey, how're you?

467
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,520 
-Thanks for coming. You look nice.
-Thank you for having me. So do you.

468
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,960 
So this is essentially
a fundraiser for the rebuilding of coral?

469
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,800 
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I love that.

470
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,880 
I'm all for saving the ocean.
I love the ocean.

471
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,720 
I can't imagine Sarah would've
gone to an event like this before,

472
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,000 
and I really do hope that she brings
her best behavior to the table.

473
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,280 
I heard there was going to be mermaids,
so I need to see some mermaids.

474
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,480 
-Hi.
-Can we get a photo?

475
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,240 
Don't you splash me, you little devil.

476
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,520 
I don't think Jade's gonna
offer me an olive branch anytime soon.

477
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,760 
So as much as it pains me, I'm gonna be
the bigger person and offer it to him.

478
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,520 
-You're so sexy.
-He vibes.

479
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,000 
-Look how jealous Nathan is.
-Nathan, get one.

480
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,200 
Do something crazy.

481
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,840 
I need something crazier.

482
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,080 
You look great. Sexy merman.

483
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160 
Hi.

484
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,000 
Hi.

485
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,200 
Can I talk to you,
like a little turn on the daybed?

486
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,720 
I was having such a great time.

487
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,200 
Mood kill, vibe killer.

488
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,600 
-How are you?
-Good.

489
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,160 
I just don't want to have any drama
at Elle's event.

490
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,560 
Yeah, I don't either. That's why
I wanted to have a chat with you.

491
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,760 
I'd love to sit down,
have a conversation with you

492
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,680 
outside of all of these people

493
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,680 
just to say why I said what I said.

494
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,320 
-Okay.
-Just no, like, judgment.

495
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,120 
-Just a conversation.
-There was judgment at the start.

496
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,520 
-Sure.
-That's why I'm…

497
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,240 
I just want to see
if there's a way forward for us.

498
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,600 
I'm determined to get to the bottom
of his follower situation.

499
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,080 
But maybe my approach was a little off.

500
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,680 
I want to have a conversation with Jade
one-on-one without an audience.

501
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,040 
-Okay, well, next week? Yeah.
-Meet next week.

502
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,480 
-Yeah.
-Okay, awesome.

503
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,520 
-Thanks, Alex. Okay.
-See you next week.

504
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,560 
Oh, my God.
I'm chatting with Alex next week.

505
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,160 
-What did he say?
-He wants to have a chat outside of this.

506
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,480 
Where does he want to go?

507
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,600 
I don't know. I feel like
it was more authentic that time.

508
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,080 
I love you.

509
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,880 
-Love you.
-You cute little biscuit.

510
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960 
-You come with Cai?
-Yeah, I was nervous.

511
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,800 
I hung out in the car park for ages.

512
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,720 
-Why were you nervous?
-I'm just… I feel…

513
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,880 
I feel a little awkward.

514
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800 
-Hi.
-Hi.

515
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,960 
-Hello.
-You look beautiful.

516
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,920 
-You look really beautiful.
-Your eyes look incredible.

517
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,520 
Really? They just got extra green
when I saw you.

518
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,080 
-I love this girl. Really cute.
-She's cute, eh?

519
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,360 
So how are we?

520
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,400 
Good, yeah.

521
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,560 
-I'm just a little bit…
-The girls?

522
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,040 
I haven't spoken to any of them,
and I don't want to cause a scene.

523
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,880 
What's the vibe like?

524
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,120 
I'm not gonna lie.

525
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,320 
I know that Elle isn't so…
She's not a fan of yours.

526
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,800 
I was quite surprised
that you were even here.

527
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,400 
Yeah. She doesn't know who I am.

528
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,400 
That's what I mean.
I get to know someone before I hate them.

529
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,240 
-Much better strategy.
-Exactly.

530
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,520 
Then you have a right
to be up on that high horse.

531
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,280 
Otherwise you're up there
clip clopping, looking stupid.

532
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,440 
-I know.
-Speaking of high horses…

533
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,840 
-We did meet up with Saskia and Dave.
-Yes.

534
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,760 
Maybe a little bit awkward,
but Saskia and Elle have definitely…

535
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,640 
I don't really understand
why Elle and Saskia have an issue with me.

536
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,760 
None of them have made
any effort to know me.

537
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,960 
Should Sarah say something?

538
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,280 
Do you feel comfortable
having a conversation with her?

539
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,240 
I just don't want it to escalate.

540
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,360 
I don't know
if I'm able to go all afternoon

541
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,880 
and be nice to people
who have been talking shit.

542
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,160 
-You gotta get it off your chest.
-Yeah.

543
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,560 
You gotta have a conversation.
I've learned, get it out there.

544
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,680 
-I'll be there.
-Yeah.

545
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,720 
If there's fireworks, there's fireworks.

546
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,400 
But you'll at least leave knowing
you said what you wanted to say,

547
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,680 
with a clear conscience.

548
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,880 
-You're gonna run into these people.
-Yeah.

549
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,360 
I just want to have a chat to her
and talk it out,

550
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,160 
and let's just see what happens.

551
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,640 
Everyone, guys. We're doing speeches now.

552
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,920 
Obviously, you've seen CHARM,
and that grows coral at scale.

553
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,880 
But the question is,

554
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,880 
how do we actually take that coral
that's grown in that aquarium

555
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,880 
and rehabilitate reefs? And this is how.

556
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,040 
Shall we?

557
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,600 
-A mermaid.
-It's me.

558
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,720 
-It's you?
-It's me.

559
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,560 
-Elle!
-Yes.

560
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,040 
What we've got
is an artificial coral reef,

561
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,680 
and we can plant coral all over her.

562
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,320 
And in a few months,
this will be a new coral reef.

563
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,920 
That is so cool.

564
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,840 
It's a very Elle thing to do

565
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,880 
to tie a life-sized statue of herself
into saving the ocean.

566
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,280 
So we want to invite some of you
to come plant coral on this right now.

567
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,560 
Me!

568
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,360 
Come.

569
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,640 
We are helping change the world.

570
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720 
-These are the corals.
-Yeah.

571
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,960 
You're gonna take one…

572
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,160 
Shove that little pickle in there.

573
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,120 
Is that fake eyelashes?

574
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,640 
Did you put eyelashes on your mermaid?

575
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,000 
I have this inner urge
to knock it into the pool,

576
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,440 
just to see if it will swim
like a mermaid.

577
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,160 
Everyone. Now we have a real-life mermaid

578
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,760 
that is going to give
a little performance to us.

579
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,400 
Show that life should be all about magic.

580
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,640 
The mermaid performance reminded me

581
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,760 
of when I'd try to show Mom
how long I could hold my breath.

582
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280 
-I'd love to. Right here.
-Okay, perfect.

583
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,320 
-There we go. Perfect.
-Perfect. Thank you.

584
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,960 
The best part, even though
these guys are little babies…

585
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,400 
We got a new mermaid in town.

586
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,200 
No, I didn't do that.

587
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,600 
We think you're a mermaid anyway.
Don't need to jump in the water.

588
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,160 
-We're acting natural.
-No…

589
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,040 
-That was amazing. So exciting.
-You've done a great job.

590
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,400 
I can't sit there and pretend
that everything is okay

591
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,800 
when I have an issue or I'm upset.

592
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,120 
So as much as I don't like this…

593
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,960 
-Hello.
-Hi.

594
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,880 
-Can we chat?
-Yes.

595
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,560 
…I think I need to speak to them
because I just can't let it go.

596
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,960 
I just wanted to pull you guys aside

597
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,040 
because I heard a rumor that

598
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,719 
Elle has been talking some shit about me.

599
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,199 
-About you.
-Yeah.

600
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,639 
Haven't been talking any shit
about you at all.

601
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,000 
-Really?
-Yeah.

602
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,719 
-So you didn't call me fake?
-Absolutely not.

603
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,560 
I was infuriated.

604
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,560 
Whatever I have said about her,
I will say to her face.

605
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,600 
-I'll tell you exactly what I've said.
-Please do.

606
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,520 
I still don't know anything about you.

607
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,880 
And that I'm confused
as to who you are as a person.

608
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,040 
You and I don't know each other very well.

609
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,360 
But I've heard so many things
about you saying that I'm fake.

610
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,000 
And I'm honestly sick of hearing about it.

611
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,800 
It is weird
'cause it's coming from Nathan.

612
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,040 
-What's up?
-I miss you.

613
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,680 
-What did Nathan say?
-That you said I was fake.

614
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,320 
Nathan would never say that.

615
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,840 
-He did.
-It's not true.

616
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,320 
Nathan's not a liar.

617
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,000 
But he did say it.

618
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,920 
I was absolutely gobsmacked,

619
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,880 
but I did not want to make a scene
in front of all of our guests.

620
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,320 
I'll tell you now, I never said
any of those things. Full stop.

621
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,160 
If she's lying, she deserves an Emmy

622
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,720 
because she is flat out
denying my reality.

623
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,880 
It's tearing me down
to keep hearing this stuff.

624
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,320 
Hannah told me, Nathan told me,
everyone keeps telling me.

625
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,680 
I'm so sorry.
I don't care who told you what,

626
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,840 
but right now, this is Elle's event.

627
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,360 
You can't out-grieve the widow.
You're more upset than Elle.

628
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,160 
No, I'm upset because…
I'm talking to my friend.

629
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,880 
I don't want this to take away
from Elle's event.

630
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,240 
Just leave.
