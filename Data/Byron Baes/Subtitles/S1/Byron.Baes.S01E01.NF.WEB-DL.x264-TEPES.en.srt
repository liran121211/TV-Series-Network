1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,880 
Okay, mark it.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,960 
Yeah, so open it and slap it.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,840 
Ready? Go.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760 
That was so exciting, you guys.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,280
{\an8}Oh, my God.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,120 
So heavy.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,960 
-Yeah.
-I'm sad.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,800 
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you too.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,480 
Well, you have a good time.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,720 
-Love you.
-Okay, bye.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,240 
Moving somewhere new is scary.
I don't know a soul in Byron Bay.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,080 
My name's Sarah, I'm from the Gold Coast.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,760 
And I'm a singer, influencer and pianist.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,880 
Byron is like the mecca
for creative types.

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,280 
Every musician, artist,

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,560 
anybody who wants to create,
collaborate, are so drawn to Byron.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,319 
And I'm just
really excited for this new adventure.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,040 
<i>-Alex speaking.</i>
-Hi, is it Alex?

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,480 
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Hi, this is Sarah calling.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,920 
<i>-Sarah who?</i>
-The singer from the Gold Coast.

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,520 
<i>Okay.</i>

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,320 
I think I spoke to your assistant
and she set up a meeting for you and I.

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,480 
I'm wondering if that was gonna go ahead.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,120 
<i>Just confirm with her, please.</i>

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,400 
-Okay.
<i>-Thanks, Sarah from the Gold Coast.</i>

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,560 
Okay, bye.

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,200 
Finally here in Byron.

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,560 
Yas!

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,920 
There's such
a different bunch of people here.

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,440 
These people are a vibe.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,040 
My name is Jade Kevin Foster, I'm…

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,760 
Hey, babe.

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,240 
I'm coming to Byron Bay
to make new friends.

34
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,919 
I am obsessed with your dress.
You look gorgeous.

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,920 
There are a lot of influencers
in Byron now,

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,680 
and as the number one most followed
male influencer of Australia,

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,360 
I need to surround myself
with likeminded people.

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,200 
Being an influencer can be lonely.

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,680 
And I'm absolutely terrified.

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,520 
I'm terrified
about my life in Byron right now.

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,360 
But I'm also excited as well.

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,280 
Byron is one of the most
beautiful places in this world.

43
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,600 
Look at this day.

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,520 
It's gonna be so good.

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,320 
This is why I live in Byron.

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,680 
I'd love to
get lost in those hills someday.

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,280 
It's actually sunny.

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,480 
<i>It's a surf town with hippies.</i>

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,600 
<i>The energy is just incredibly beautiful.</i>

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,640 
It's got beautiful beaches.

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,680 
Beautiful people.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,560 
<i>It's got everything that I love</i>
<i>in life in one very small town.</i>

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,720 
Everywhere you look, everyone you look at,

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,520 
it's like a postcard.
It's fucking beautiful.

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,760 
That's why it's a mecca for influencers.

56
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,520 
We're like a tight crew
of content creators,

57
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,480 
but we hate that word "influencer."

58
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,120 
-Hey.
-Hi!

59
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,920 
Take all of that bathing suit off,
Elias, you sexy dog.

60
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120 
<i>-Our crew of photographers…</i>
-That was sick.

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,680 
<i>…fashion designers…</i>

62
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,640 
Amazing.

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,160 
Gorgeous.

64
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,680 
<i>…spiritual healers…</i>

65
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,480 
Be right here, right now.

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,680 
<i>…we're all doing things.</i>

67
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,320 
-Good job, bloke.
-Thanks, baby.

68
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,160 
Whether you've lived your whole life here…

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,520 
This is just so powerful.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,560 
…or you're new in town…

71
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,200 
You guys, today is the day.

72
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,839 
I am just about to move in
to my new Byron Bay house.

73
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,560 
…breaking into our crew can be tough.

74
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,680 
I just moved here. I'm brand new.

75
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,520 
There's a difference between new and fake.

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,640 
I've got a true opinion of you.

77
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,840 
I think you're an egotistical fuck,

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,520 
and seriously insecure.

79
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,400 
You gotta stop causing beef
between two guys.

80
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,720 
-Do you have a problem with me?
-I do.

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,640 
You're an absolute fucking disgrace.

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,960 
Absolutely fucking pathetic.

83
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160 
It's just been really hard.

84
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,040 
I'm confused as to who you are.

85
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,080 
Just leave.

86
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,440 
Byron Bay has this strong power

87
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,200 
that if it wants you here,
it sucks you in,

88
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,120 
and if it doesn't,
it literally spits you out.

89
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,280 
That's gorgeous with the sun, Hannah.

90
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,920 
Seriously, darling, it is beautiful.

91
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,960 
Beautiful. I love that,
how you're bending your body.

92
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,400 
-I don't know what I'm doing.
-It looks good.

93
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,680 
Whatever you're doing, it looks so pretty.

94
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440 
I would describe my personality

95
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,320 
as bohemian, eclectic
and a little bit strange.

96
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,480
{\an8}Do a little dance. Do a little thing.

97
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,280 
My family is known for our company Bisque.

98
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,680 
Mum and I model the clothes

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,080 
and whatever my mum
puts on, people just snap up.

100
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,120 
All right, Mama.

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,240 
Oh, my God. Look at you, you are so hot.

102
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,120 
Does anyone ever tell you that?

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,560 
You know I've only got one pose.
Give me a moment.

104
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,240 
-Gotta compose myself.
-Yeah.

105
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,040 
Our style reflects
the earthy vibe of Byron.

106
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,600 
We're all relaxed and chilled and flowy.

107
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,760 
I love the palm frond shadow
over your face a little bit.

108
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,080 
Just go that way a little.

109
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,160 
Okay, there we go.

110
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,000 
Honey, I'm home!

111
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,480 
-Oh, my God!
-Hey. There's my favorite family.

112
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,080
{\an8}Nathan's rep around town

113
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,480 
is that he's a cheeky,
fun, energetic party boy.

114
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,800 
Oh, my God.

115
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,600 
-You well? You look beautiful.
-I'm good.

116
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,560 
What're you up to?

117
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,000 
Nathan and I have hooked up a few times,
but it's pretty normal for Byron Bay.

118
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000 
You guys match really well.

119
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680 
I'm not gonna put on black.

120
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,400 
-Look at this place. Of course.
-Did you dress for us?

121
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,160 
People skills has always
been a strong point of mine.

122
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,840 
I love connecting people.

123
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,960 
And I just love to make people smile.

124
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,920 
I heard about this party.

125
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,440 
What's going on?

126
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,120 
You want to get the best
in the business involved?

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,240 
You're confident, I love it.

128
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,480 
You guys want a drink?

129
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,040 
I'd love a drink, actually.

130
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,400 
I'm good with a booch.

131
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,120 
-Yeah.
-A booch would be amazing.

132
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,040 
Booch.

133
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,080 
Feels like forever since I've seen you.

134
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,440 
-I know. It's been a minute.
-Yeah, it has.

135
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,560 
Yeah, so tell me more about this party.

136
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,200 
Maybe you've got friends
that I haven't met yet.

137
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,600 
And maybe they're coming.

138
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,160 
Maybe you should invite some.

139
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800 
I'm single at the moment, so…

140
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,360 
-Single's good.
-I know, it is.

141
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,480 
I love being single. I love being fun.

142
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,040 
I also do want
to settle down at some point.

143
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,520 
-Do you?
-Not in the near--

144
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,440 
No boys wanna
ever settle down in Byron Bay.

145
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,600 
So for you to actually say
that you wanna settle down, that's…

146
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000 
I mean, eventually.

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,160 
What's the guest list like?
Elias is coming?

148
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,000 
Yeah?

149
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,320 
-Elle, your roomie. Yeah.
-Beautiful. Amazing.

150
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,000 
Is Jess and Lauren coming?

151
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,520 
I am going to invite the Bell sisters.

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,680 
It's…

153
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,560 
-We've had things--
-Really?

154
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,880 
Yeah.

155
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,160 
There's definitely
some unfinished business

156
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,040 
between Jess and myself.

157
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,240 
I am throwing a party
to try to resolve things.

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,320 
We're in the same friendship group.
So it's time to make peace.

159
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,440 
-I'll stick to the dance floor.
-Stick to the dance floor.

160
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,280 
No, it's gonna be really intense.

161
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,760
{\an8}I need nine models
and we've only locked in four.

162
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,080
{\an8}-Oh, God.
-I just need you to try on the stuff.

163
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,320 
Show me what you got.

164
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,400 
My sister Lauren and I grew up here
and we've lived here our entire lives.

165
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
{\an8}-Do you like this?
-I love this one.

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,200
{\an8}So I feel like
it needs to be tighter at the waist.

167
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,080 
Byron used to be
a really laid-back hippie town,

168
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,640 
but it has changed so much.

169
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,520 
And there's a lot of competition.

170
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760 
It's full of designers, models,

171
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,160 
and there's so many
fashion labels based here.

172
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,480 
We're all hustling to make a go of it.

173
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,600 
I love this.

174
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,400 
Cute.

175
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,640 
Cute! I love that one.

176
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,760 
It's so cute.

177
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,440 
-I designed this for you to wear.
-Thanks.

178
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,840 
-It's extra. Do you want a photo?
-Yeah, I'll take a photo.

179
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,560 
Social media is such a huge thing.

180
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,480 
Cute.

181
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,280 
We've been able to make $100,000
in the first hour of a collection launch.

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160 
So that's been
the key factor in my success.

183
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,880 
I love this on you.

184
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,640 
I got something to tell you.

185
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,880 
Byron is such a hot spot now,
but it's still the same small town.

186
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,080 
There's a lot of drama,
especially in our friendship group.

187
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,080 
Hannah invited us
to her party on Friday night.

188
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160 
-What? What the hell?
-Yeah.

189
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,360 
Are we gonna go?

190
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,400 
I don't know.
I don't wanna be petty and not go.

191
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,800 
-Yeah.
-She's made the effort to invite us.

192
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200 
So I feel like we should go.

193
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,840 
I think that Hannah
invited me to her party

194
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,680 
to brush things under the rug.

195
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,960 
But I will be asking
for an apology the second I walk in.

196
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,960 
I wonder if she will apologize.

197
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,000 
I hope so.

198
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,680 
-But you just never know with Hannah.
-Yeah, true.

199
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,880 
-My man, how are you?
-What's going on?

200
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,560 
-What's going on?
-Mate. Just cruisin'.

201
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760 
What you got going on?

202
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,240 
I'm trying to tattoo on pigskin,
but it's a little uncomfortable.

203
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,080 
As a vegetarian,
I haven't been in a butcher for…

204
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,200 
Don't think I've ever been in a butcher.

205
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,200 
-So that was uncomfortable.
-I could imagine. Look at that.

206
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,680 
We've got such a diverse crew
of characters in our friendship circle.

207
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,800 
Cai's one of the coolest guys I know.

208
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,920 
He likes to keep the peace
amongst all our friends.

209
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,200 
And regardless of how different we look,

210
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,560 
or how different we are,
we're such good bros.

211
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,280 
Mate, these are so sick.

212
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,760 
Thank you.

213
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,120 
Been testing some images
for this exhibition I've got coming up.

214
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,440 
This is unreal. I'm losing my mind.

215
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,640 
I grew up here, I went to school
five minutes down the road from my house.

216
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,560 
I am a photographer.

217
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,240 
A lot of the work that I'm creating
is influenced by this area.

218
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,120 
There's so much cool stuff
that's being created here in Byron Shire,

219
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,240 
and it's awesome to be a part of that.

220
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,600 
Mate, Hannah's having
a party this weekend.

221
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,960 
You should come.

222
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,760 
It's like a Ibiza
kind of style theme, so, like, white.

223
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,760 
Sick!

224
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360 
You'll stick out
like a sore thumb in that place.

225
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,960 
That would be so good.

226
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,280 
-Okay.
-It'd be so sick.

227
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,040 
I just don't have
any white clothes to play around with.

228
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,320 
So I'll have to go op-shopping
or something.

229
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960 
It's gonna be fun.
There's a fair crew going.

230
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,600 
I'll give you a warning.

231
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,160 
The Bell sisters are coming,
and I asked Hannah,

232
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,560 
and I think there's a bit of drama
between those two, I don't know.

233
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,000 
I mean, Byron, there's always drama.

234
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,000 
We're all very close.

235
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,680 
So there's some very strong emotions
and feelings amongst all our friends

236
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,440 
and no doubt there's gonna be
drama going down at the party.

237
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,080 
Byron is just like
a breeding ground for creativity, I guess.

238
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,080 
That's certainly what drew me to Byron.

239
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,520 
I know I've got the talent,

240
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,880 
but what I need help with
is finding the audience.

241
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,200 
Well, look, if they wanna do it,
it's gonna be expensive.

242
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,360 
Who?

243
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,600 
Never heard of him.

244
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,040 
Darl, they're very 2016.

245
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,760
{\an8}You can't have Big W prices
and expect to get David Jones talent.

246
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,480 
-Hi!
-Hello, how are you?

247
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,120 
-Good. Thank you. I'm Sarah.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

248
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,680 
Couple of years ago,
people started to care about

249
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,400 
how many Instagram followers you have.

250
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,520 
And I quickly worked out
there's good money in it.

251
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160 
-Hello! Hey, I'm Alex.
-Hi!

252
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,600 
I don't just manage anyone.

253
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,560 
The group of people
I manage is very small.

254
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,160 
And to break into that circle,
you better be pretty amazing.

255
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240 
Let me just make a space for you.

256
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,680 
Lots of crystals.

257
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,520 
They're not doing anything,
still single, still poor.

258
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800 
Haven't worked.

259
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,280 
Where are you from? What your life story?

260
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,680 
-All the fun parts.
-Okay.

261
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,840 
I'm from the Gold Coast.
I'm a singer and pianist, obviously.

262
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,840 
So I'm, like, brand-new in town.

263
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,800 
And I'm here to work on my album.

264
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,640 
Why do you wanna be here in Byron?

265
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,600 
I want to meet people
when I'm here and make connections,

266
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,800 
find people to collaborate with.

267
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880 
What are your vibes about Byron?

268
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,200 
I think the locals are very proud,

269
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,080 
and they're their own
really fierce kind of community.

270
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,320 
So it's a little bit
of a hard one to crack

271
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,600 
when they know
that you're from out of town.

272
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,560 
Yeah. Do you have socials at the moment?

273
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,440 
-I use Instagram.
-Yeah.

274
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520 
And I have a Twitter account.

275
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,160 
-Twitter, darl? That's very 2012.
-Yeah.

276
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,000 
-If you wanna hear my music…
-Sure.

277
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,360 
…I can play you something
just on the piano.

278
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,120 
-It's here, may as well.
-Let's do it. We're here now.

279
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,960 
<i>You can try and fight but</i>

280
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,400 
<i>You will always be the villain</i>

281
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,840 
<i>In someone's story</i>

282
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,440 
Since I was really little,
music is all I've ever wanted to do.

283
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,680 
My mum was born in Seychelles islands

284
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,240 
and she immigrated
to Australia in the '70s.

285
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,040 
Being Seselwa was a really
big part of my upbringing.

286
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,480 
My mom taught me all these Creole songs,

287
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,320 
so it was a really big
part of my childhood

288
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,680 
and the main reason
why I wanted to be a singer.

289
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,480 
<i>Everything's a weapon</i>

290
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,400 
And now that I've gotten here,

291
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,320 
it's so important that I make
some new connections with some people

292
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,560 
to help me to get where I need to go.

293
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,480 
-And then it'll have a big instrumental.
-Gorgeous.

294
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,640 
It's gonna go in and I do
like a minute with kind of instrumental

295
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,000 
which I haven't worked out yet.

296
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,400 
Gorgeous. Great voice.

297
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,360 
-Thank you.
-Really beautiful voice.

298
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,840 
You can sing, but to be brutal,

299
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,280 
there's a lot of amazing singers
out there who don't have a career.

300
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,760 
So I think if we can build
an audience around you, then--

301
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,680 
-So you can help me.
-I can certainly give it a shot.

302
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,680 
There's this event on the weekend.

303
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,360 
There's gonna be the typical Byron crowd.

304
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,120 
Think, like, good-looking boys,
good-looking girls.

305
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,360 
-Okay.
-I stalked Hannah's Instagram.

306
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,480 
She's friends with a lot of
really hot Instagrammers as well.

307
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,240 
So, if you're free,
do you wanna come with me?

308
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,320 
If you really wanna be
successful as an influencer,

309
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,040 
you need to know these people.

310
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,800 
It's all about meeting people here.

311
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,840 
That could be a way
I could really help expand your circle.

312
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,080 
-Let's do it. I'm super keen.
-Okay. Cool.

313
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,319 
-How good was that?
-Pretty fun.

314
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400 
There's a few.

315
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,119 
Not too many people out today.

316
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,119
{\an8}-Yeah.
-Frothy.

317
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,440
{\an8}That one I dropped in on you,
that was good.

318
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,359 
Haven't seen you for a bit.
Are you seeing anyone?

319
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,760 
I'm single as a Pringle at the moment.

320
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,920 
Same, man. I'm a recluse. So--

321
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000 
-You are.
-I need to come out with you more often.

322
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,720 
Don't tell me
that not every mother and daughter

323
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,680 
is DMing you on your Instagram.

324
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,800 
-Don't think I'm an idiot.
-My mum DMs me, yeah.

325
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,720 
-And my sister probably.
-You have a sister?

326
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,840 
Yeah, no…

327
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,720 
I work in digital content creation,
and I do some modeling as well.

328
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,080 
There's more to me than meets the eye.

329
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,600 
I'm a deep thinker
and I've got a spiritual side.

330
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,920 
These are some things I don't
necessarily show through the 'Gram.

331
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,480 
Are you going to Hannah's this Friday?
I heard she's having a party.

332
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,080 
I'll definitely be going.

333
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,680 
Who knows?
We might both find a wife up there.

334
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,600 
Nathan loves socializing,
trying to chase that next thrill,

335
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,880 
that better feeling.
I don't know what he's trying to achieve,

336
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,440 
but, you know, it's working for him,
so good on you, mate.

337
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,320 
You do all right,
you know, as a single man.

338
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,840 
I like to make people laugh
and I think people like that.

339
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,880 
Elias is probably one of
the best-looking blokes I've ever seen.

340
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,920 
So what I do is I let Elias
draw 'em in and then I'll pounce.

341
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,520 
See, he's the honeypot
and I'm Winnie the Pooh.

342
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,400 
Everyone loves Winnie the Pooh,
but they want the honey first.

343
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,480 
Every time I've gone up to Hannah's,
I just can't have a bad time. Like--

344
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,640 
Yeah. There's been
a few good parties there.

345
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,120 
I show 'em the good life, make 'em laugh.

346
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,040 
That's me.

347
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,880 
Should be sick. Looking forward to it.

348
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,480 
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

349
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,120 
Stay with your breath.

350
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,920 
Reach the arms up on the next inhale.

351
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,840 
Byron Bay is built
on that hippie, Zen lifestyle.

352
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,840 
We're gonna soften
the forehead into the earth.

353
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,640 
You have to do yoga,
even if you're not good at it, like me.

354
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,960 
Try and feel the way the belly
is expanding with the inhale.

355
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,560 
-You can take your shoes off.
-Okay.

356
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,600 
-Yep. Welcome to class.
-Thank you for having me.

357
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,560 
Yoga is definitely not my scene.

358
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,400 
But you know what,
I've come to Byron to make new friends,

359
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,600 
so if that means putting myself out there

360
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,600 
and doing something
I'm not quite comfortable with doing,

361
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680 
then, so be it.

362
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,560 
How much longer do we stay like this?

363
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,440 
This guy was so out of place at yoga.

364
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,800 
<i>Namaste.</i>

365
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,040 
<i>-Namaste.</i>
<i>-Namaste.</i>

366
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120 
I suck.

367
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,320 
I could just tell from the second
I saw him that he wasn't from Byron.

368
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,480 
I just moved here.

369
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,160 
-You just moved here. From where?
-Yeah.

370
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,160 
-From Gold Coast.
-Cool.

371
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,360 
Yeah.

372
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,680 
I think the Gold Coast
is a very different place.

373
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,880 
It's like a bit more of a,
mean to say, but tacky kind of vibe.

374
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,040 
But a lot of good people
come out of the Gold Coast.

375
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,960 
What do you do for work?

376
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,720 
-I'm an influencer.
-You're an influencer.

377
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,080 
Yeah.

378
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160 
-Byron's a perfect spot then.
-Is it?

379
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,080 
Are you getting heaps of good content?

380
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,000 
I am. I found a few spots around
my house that were really cool.

381
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,320 
-Yeah.
-But, yeah.

382
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,440 
I'm looking up on Google,
"Best spots in Byron to take pics."

383
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,480 
I feel like they're all so basic
that everyone's thrashed the location.

384
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,000 
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

385
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080 
What do you do for work?

386
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,640 
-I have a clothing brand.
-Cool.

387
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,440 
Yeah. How good though,
you can live here with your career?

388
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600 
-I know. Yeah.
-It's easy to live anywhere.

389
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,240 
-What have you been doing here?
-I've been binge-watching <i>Kardashians.</i>

390
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,440 
-Have you?
-By myself.

391
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,200 
-You love the Kardashians?
-I'm obsessed with the Kardashians.

392
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,160 
Yeah, that was like
my break in my career was,

393
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840 
I had Kylie wear my clothes.

394
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,040 
-That is so cool.
-Yeah.

395
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,760 
That's so weird, that was
kind of my big break as well.

396
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,800 
Because Kim came to Melbourne
and I attended her fragrance launch,

397
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,400 
and then she posted
a photo of her and I together

398
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,120 
and my Instagram just
blew up when she posted it.

399
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,280 
-No way.
-Yeah.

400
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,680 
In 2014, I had 11,000 followers.

401
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,080 
After Kim Kardashian shared my photo,
I woke up in the morning

402
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,040 
to over 200,000 followers.

403
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,400 
Now I have over
1,2 million followers on Instagram.

404
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,560 
I didn't get your name.

405
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,240 
-Jade.
-Jade. I'm Jess.

406
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,640 
You'll have to come
for a drink with me and my sister.

407
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,400 
-You'll love my sister.
-That'd be fun to meet your sister.

408
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,120 
I'm really hopeful
that I've found a friend in Jess.

409
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,840 
She's beautiful, she's well-dressed

410
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,800 
and she sucks at yoga,
so we're gonna get along great.

411
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,280 
-Hello?
-Hi, babe!

412
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,360 
-So nice to see you.
-I know, darling.

413
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440 
What are you making?

414
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,880 
I just made you a ceremonial cacao.

415
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,760 
Stop it! Oh, my God.

416
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,280 
Yeah, so it's cacao,
cinnamon, ashwagandha,

417
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,840 
some medicinal mushrooms,
some coconut milk.

418
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,000 
-Yeah.
-Incredible.

419
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,200 
So Elle is Nathan's housemate
and my close friend.

420
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,680 
She is a spiritual person

421
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,880 
and that's probably been
our connection from the start.

422
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,560 
The connection to spirituality
in Byron Bay is quite a beautiful thing.

423
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,640 
There are crystals
all throughout the mountains here,

424
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,480 
and it helps you ground yourself,

425
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,640 
especially when life
gets a little bit crazy.

426
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,920 
I brought some clothes for…

427
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,240 
You know how I'm having my party.

428
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,280 
Amazing.

429
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,800 
Nath came home yesterday,
and he told me that he'd gone to see you.

430
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200 
-We had some great chats.
-Yeah?

431
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,880 
-He's a funny dude.
-Yeah.

432
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,320 
You two hooked up a little while ago.

433
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,560 
It's pretty standard
for my friends to possibly like someone

434
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,120 
that I've already
hooked up with, and vice versa.

435
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,160 
Byron Bay, it's a small town,
so the pool is quite small.

436
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,040 
You didn't answer my question.

437
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,880 
-Wait, what question?
-You, Nathan, did you guys hook up?

438
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,840 
-Yeah, a few times. Yes.
-Okay. Right. A few.

439
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,760 
Elle did seem pretty interested
that Nathan and I had hooked up.

440
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,440 
Don't know why.

441
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,960 
Well, I'm super excited about the party.

442
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,280 
Who have you invited? Give me the goss.

443
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,760 
I've decided to invite the Bell sisters.

444
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,080 
Oh, my God.

445
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,560 
Tell me what actually
happened with you and Jess.

446
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,800 
It was a series of unfortunate events.

447
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,400 
Hannah definitely dances around the truth.

448
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,640 
And I feel sometimes I really
have to wedge information out of her.

449
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,200 
So what situation specifically?

450
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,840 
It was to do with

451
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,120 
me feeling
underappreciated as Jess' friend.

452
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,800 
One night in particular, I saw her out

453
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,920 
and she basically

454
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,480 
wanted to try to confront me
about the situation.

455
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,120 
And she was getting…

456
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,960 
-Aggressive.
-Bit more staunch.

457
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,760 
Right, and so then you two had
a proper heated argument in the street?

458
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,880 
Yeah, pretty much. It was… It wasn't nice.

459
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,040 
I don't exactly still know what happened.

460
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,680 
-I do hope that you can just sort it out.
-Thank you.

461
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,240 
-Yeah.
-Same.

462
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,080 
No, it's time to. Yeah. Thanks.

463
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,680 
Hey!

464
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,080 
-How are you?
-Good.

465
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,240 
Nice to see you again.

466
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,160 
-This is my sister.
-Hi, Lauren!

467
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,800 
Lovely to meet you.

468
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,040 
-How cute is this?
-So nice, right?

469
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,080 
You're so lucky to live here.

470
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,360 
I just moved here.

471
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,680 
-Lovely!
-Yeah.

472
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,720 
We're gonna introduce him to a few people.

473
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,560 
-Nice. Definitely.
-Please.

474
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640 
Is it like a crew you hang out with?

475
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,200 
Yeah, we've definitely got
our, like, gang of friends.

476
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,320 
-Like our girl gang.
-That's something I don't have.

477
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,040 
That's one of the reasons
why I travelled down here

478
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,640 
and wanted to move here is because

479
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,480 
I just found in my life,
like, from school,

480
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,920 
growing up, I just haven't had
that real good connection,

481
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,600 
that good group of friends.

482
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,600 
Jade is definitely different
to my friends that I grew up with.

483
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,120 
I feel like he just connects with people.
He has such a good heart.

484
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,000 
-Friday night, you need to come--
-Come to this party.

485
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,920 
-Friday night? Yes. Cheers! Thank you.
-Yeah.

486
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,760 
So, yeah, Hannah is a friend of mine,

487
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,800 
so it's her parents' house,
but we haven't spoken in months.

488
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,720 
We just had, like, a falling out.

489
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,800 
-She just sent me these hectic messages.
-She got left out of a dinner.

490
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,720 
But she didn't. She felt she did.

491
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,040 
It was literally a dinner after work.

492
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,480 
I went with a staff member and my sister.

493
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,760 
And I'm getting
these abusive text messages

494
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,160 
because my staff member posted
on Instagram that we were having dinner.

495
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,920 
Hannah just lost her shit for no reason.

496
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,600 
The last time I saw Hannah,
she was screaming at me.

497
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,280 
And then she stormed off.

498
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,400 
So how did she invite you to the party?

499
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,400 
I think she's trying again,
which is good for her.

500
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,800 
That shows good character.

501
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,560 
But I'm going there
to try and sort it out.

502
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,000 
I want her to apologize to me
'cause I deserve an apology.

503
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,960 
I'm going there to make it better,
if she's not gonna make it better,

504
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,080 
there's nothing there.

505
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,840 
Be ready. We might leave
after ten minutes. Who knows?

506
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,000 
Shit's about to get interesting.

507
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,040 
-Does this look all right?
-Absolutely incredible.

508
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120 
Okay and here? What do we think here?

509
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,240 
Maybe we should prop these lemons up more.

510
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,000 
Oh, my God, the new cushions!
I don't like this one.

511
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,960 
'Cause the whole thing
was meant to be really simple white.

512
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,880 
Yeah.

513
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,000 
For my party,

514
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,520 
the house is looking… absolutely magical.

515
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,800 
I'm excited for
a little get-together with close friends.

516
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,640 
I am feeling a little apprehensive
with everything to do with Jess.

517
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,680 
I'm trusting the universe will make this
the healing night that I am hoping for.

518
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,800 
Byron is super tight-knit,
so I feel like a bit of an outsider.

519
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,360 
But today is the day of Hannah's party.

520
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,240 
And I can't wait to get in there
and meet some people.

521
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,120 
I just hope they like me.

522
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,480 
Oh, no.

523
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,720 
I'm nervous. I'm very nervous.
I don't know what to wear.

524
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,520 
Don't know what to expect
or who those people are.

525
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,400 
I have tried
my whole life to be in a group.

526
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,120 
It's a big deal for me. It is.

527
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,920 
Hey!

528
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,960 
Hi!

529
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,800 
-Hello.
-Oh, my God!

530
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,720 
I feel really good
to have that friendship backbone.

531
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,840 
I feel like I've got
some extra level of support there,

532
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,880 
and we can all do this together.

533
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,240 
-What an afternoon.
-I know.

534
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,120 
I want the D-floor to start.

535
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,800 
-Do the boogie.
-Yeah.

536
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,560 
So what's the running order?

537
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,960 
I'm having my beautiful
sound healing lady play a little--

538
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,880 
-You're doing a sound healing?
-Yeah.

539
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,320 
Did you know that part?

540
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,440 
-No, I didn't.
-I didn't tell you that.

541
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,840 
Are you meant to drink
while you sound heal?

542
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:33,360 
It's about music as it changes
the molecular cellular levels.

543
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,440 
So what you're drinking doesn't matter,
'cause this doesn't, like…

544
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,840 
It doesn't mix with your cells, does it?

545
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,960 
-It does.
-Does it?

546
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040 
Well, then put the drinks down, people.

547
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,720 
Hannah does present herself
as a spiritual person.

548
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,640 
While she's really out there,
her "spirituality" is questionable.

549
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,600 
What's crackalackin'?

550
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,440 
-How are you? Good to see ya.
-How are ya?

551
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,000
{\an8}Simba is my best mate and I'm super stoked
he's coming with me to Hannah's party.

552
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,320
{\an8}I love dragging him along to these events.
I reckon he's gonna have fun.

553
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,760 
How are you?

554
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,760 
Good to see you.

555
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,480 
-Good to see you too.
-I know.

556
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560 
That view.

557
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,200 
-No way!
-There he is.

558
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,200 
Look at the white.

559
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,880 
How are you? You good?

560
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,600 
I did my best. Are you proud?

561
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,000 
-You look great!
-Look at him.

562
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,520 
-It's like grunge swag.
-Hell yeah, I had to.

563
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,400 
What the hell?

564
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,960 
That sunset is honestly off the charts.

565
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,160 
Oh, my God. It actually looks phenomenal.

566
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,040 
-Are you kidding?
-My God, wait, I need one too.

567
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,160 
Hold up.

568
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,960 
Oh, my God! The coloring is incredible.

569
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,360 
-Is that what I got?
-No. Yours is different.

570
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,320 
Living in Byron Bay,
we're all like a tight group of friends.

571
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,080 
We know each other so well that
it can be intimidating for the new people.

572
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,000 
-Hey.
-G'day.

573
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,160 
Hello.

574
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,880 
I'm really excited to go
to this party Alex invited me to.

575
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,200 
-Hi!
-Hi! Hannah.

576
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,120 
I'm Sarah.

577
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,120 
-Hi. Alex.
-Nathan.

578
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,280 
Nice to meet you.

579
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,320 
-Thank you for letting me gatecrash.
-My pleasure.

580
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,600 
-You look fabulous.
-Thank you, so do you.

581
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,440 
-How you going? I'm Nathan.
-Hi!

582
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,280 
-Sarah. Lovely to meet you.
-Lovely to meet you.

583
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,680 
I don't know if I fit in.

584
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,240 
So I'm a little bit nervous,
but I'm excited to meet new people.

585
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,880 
I just moved here. I'm brand new.

586
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,560 
-Right.
-You guys are the first people I've met.

587
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,880 
-So you're from?
-I'm from the Gold Coast.

588
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,400 
-GC?
-Yes.

589
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,760 
What about you? Are you local?

590
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,400 
Yeah, we live in Southern Byron.

591
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,040 
-Nice.
-Yeah.

592
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,280 
Is that your partner?

593
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,280 
-No. He's my new BFF.
-Friend.

594
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,560 
As of 24 hours ago.

595
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,200 
-Great. Fantastic.
-He's the BFF.

596
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,160 
-Good.
-Yeah.

597
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,760 
Everyone knows everyone in Byron.

598
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,120 
When there's a new face in town
you want to know them.

599
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,640 
I guess that's what
both Elias and I are thinking.

600
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,000 
-Sarah.
-Elias. Nice to meet you.

601
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080 
-Elias?
-Elias.

602
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,000 
-Where are you from?
-The Gold Coast.

603
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,840 
Yeah? You moved to town recently?

604
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,960 
-Yeah, like, a week or two ago.
-Really?

605
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,720 
Yeah, I'm a singer
so I'm working on my first album.

606
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,280 
Do you play any instruments as well or--

607
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,480 
I play piano and I play ukulele.

608
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,360 
I'm like a jack of all trades
and a master of none.

609
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,320 
Hold that for a sec.

610
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,320 
What does that say?

611
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,000 
Stop! No!

612
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,040 
Inside the ring, it actually says,

613
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,200 
"Master of none."

614
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,760 
Kinda made me feel like
there's bit of a connection there.

615
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,040 
-Wow.
-Yeah.

616
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,320 
That's so funny. Wow.

617
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,440 
-Cheers to that.
-Cheers to that.

618
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,440 
I do not know anybody.

619
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,840 
I'm trying to smile
and smize at everybody.

620
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,440 
I was looking for Lauren and Jess
but they weren't there.

621
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,560 
-Hannah?
-Hi!

622
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,840 
My name's Jade. Lovely to meet you.

623
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,760 
-Lovely to meet you.
-Thanks for having me.

624
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,120 
-Hey!
-Hello.

625
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,160 
I'm feeling so nervous right now.

626
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,360 
The worst possible outcome
that could happen tonight

627
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,760 
is me being rejected
or feeling out of place.

628
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,920 
I bought you a gift.

629
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,680 
-Yeah.
-Lovely.

630
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,200 
Oh, my God! Hi, honey!

631
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,520 
You're amazing. You smell so good.

632
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,760 
Thanks, babe.

633
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,840 
Okay, what have we got here?

634
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,040 
Are you okay?

635
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,160 
I'm not okay.

636
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,520 
Oh, my God.

637
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,280 
The very first crystal I bought myself
was hot pink. It was the same color.

638
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,440 
And this is like…

639
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520 
-It lights up?
-Yeah.

640
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,720 
-Lights up.
-It's a light!

641
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,480 
Jade, are you kidding me?

642
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,680 
I hope you like it.

643
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720 
Hannah…

644
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,639 
is different.

645
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,320 
She is a very nice girl.

646
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,600 
Definitely always want to
give people the benefit of the doubt.

647
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,760 
So hopefully,
Hannah and Jess resolve their issues.

648
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,120 
Guys! Look at my new prezzie.

649
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,880 
-Hey!
-Nice to meet you.

650
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,520 
I'm Jade. Nice to meet you.

651
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,840 
-Hey, I'm Alex.
-I'm Jade. Nice to meet you.

652
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,600 
I know who Jade is.

653
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,000 
His name has come up
a few times in the office.

654
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,880 
But I'm very selective
with who I work with.

655
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,440 
And that's the type of person
I run away from.

656
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,280 
-See ya.
-Lovely to meet you.

657
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,600 
Lovely to meet you.

658
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,840 
-Yeah.
-You're never butt naked in the house.

659
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,880 
-I'm always butt naked.
-Are you? Me too.

660
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,960 
Even when you are there.
You're in your room and I, like…

661
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,120 
No one's there.

662
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,880 
Nathan is really cheeky.

663
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,560 
I think he doesn't
take anything too seriously.

664
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,960 
Which could either be
a lot of fun or a lot of trouble.

665
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,360 
I'm liking what's going on.

666
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,600 
Stop it.

667
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,320 
Elle. She is my wingman.

668
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,200 
-Yeah. Always.
-Or wing-woman.

669
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,120 
Elle came across to me as maybe
a little bit territorial with Nathan.

670
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,280 
I think she didn't really vibe with me.

671
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,080 
I just want to fit in.

672
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,880 
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Okay.

673
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,600 
-Nice to meet you.
-Lovely to meet you.

674
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,360 
<i>But I think it might take some time.</i>

675
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,360 
Thank you. Cheers.

676
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,800 
-Cheers.
-Welcome to new friends.

677
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,480 
-Grab your drink. We'll sit over here.
-Okay, great.

678
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,360 
Thank you so much. Cheers.

679
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,120 
-Okay, well.
-Back soon.

680
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,000 
-All right, well, enjoy.
-Okay.

681
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,480 
-See you guys later.
-Okay.

682
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,440 
See ya.

683
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,920 
-How are you going?
-Good. How are you?

684
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,840 
I'm all right.

685
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,240 
It's just they're… not my people.

686
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,600 
-Like, it's not--
-No. Really?

687
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,000 
There's like a Byron type, right?
Like they're very Byron type.

688
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,760 
Hannah seems sweet
and she's got a lovely house.

689
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,080 
But she's very, like,
talking like this the whole time.

690
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,440 
Like, is this chick for real?

691
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,640 
It's very Byron Bay.

692
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,760 
Jade. He's an Instagrammer.

693
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,320 
He's got a big following on Instagram.

694
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,840 
You know when you click on someone's
profile and see their Insta stories?

695
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,440 
I've been on Jade's account.
And I'll click on it,

696
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,160 
and I'll see the dots come up
and like, "Nah."

697
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,600 
Jade says he's
the most followed male in Australia.

698
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,920 
But something is not right here.

699
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,360 
-Nathan, baby.
-Hit me.

700
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,120 
What have you got?

701
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,920 
Have you seen any hot girls
you're interested in?

702
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,960 
Yes.

703
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,320 
You know how the world
wants you to be in a box?

704
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,280 
And be like, "I'm this or I'm that."

705
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,840 
And people get pissed off
when people go off the path.

706
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,280 
-Your own path. 100%.
-Yeah, exactly.

707
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,760 
-Now I think it's a bit more varied.
-Yeah.

708
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,840 
I definitely think Elias could be
somebody I'd like to get to know better.

709
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,320 
I kind of get the sense
that he is just really soft and gentle

710
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,800 
and empathetic.

711
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,600 
It's fun to hang out with him.

712
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,600 
I love that's the way everything is--

713
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,280 
What's up, my crazy humans?

714
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,800 
-What's cracking?
-Hi!

715
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,040 
Hey. How are you?

716
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,520 
-So you're new to town.
-I am. Brand new.

717
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,440 
I can show you around town.

718
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,800 
-Really?
-Yeah.

719
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,800 
Cool. Okay.

720
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,400 
That's on.

721
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,080 
I got a vibe then.

722
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,480 
Got a vibe.

723
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,360 
<i>This is gonna be very interesting.</i>

724
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,080 
<i>Elias and Nathan</i>
<i>could not be more different.</i>

725
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,200 
So this evening,

726
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,320 
you said that you were
invited by the Bell sisters.

727
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,920 
Yeah. By Jess and Lauren. Yes.

728
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,640 
Jess and I are old friends.

729
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,760 
-Old friends?
-Old friends.

730
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,880 
But we had a little falling out,

731
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,480 
and I'm not one to have
a falling out with people.

732
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,520 
I know that shit's
going to pop off tonight.

733
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,600 
Do you want to be
close with her again, or…

734
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,960 
I think we'll be okay.

735
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,320 
-You think you'll be okay?
-Yeah.

736
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,120 
-Yeah.
-And they just arrived.

737
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,400 
Hannah owes me an apology because
she went crazy for absolutely no reason.

738
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,680 
Saying sorry is powerful
and I think she should say it to me.

739
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,960 
-I need a champagne.
-Yeah. Immediately.

740
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,560 
I can tell she wants to make amends.
I think she's just holding back.

741
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,280 
Like, it's hard for me because
I feel like I'm so upfront.

742
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,240 
-You are.
-It's hard when someone isn't.

743
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,440 
Yeah.

744
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,200 
I'm not good
with any type of confrontation.

745
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,880 
And Jess can actually be quite gung ho.

746
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,120 
-Try not to get emotional.
-I'm fine.

747
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,400 
You went really pale before.
I thought you were gonna pass out.

748
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,080 
I know, in this moment,

749
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,800 
I need to center myself.

750
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,480 
Calm myself down.

751
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,560 
I'm hoping that sound healing will help
the situation between Jess and I.

752
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,680 
This is Ruby.

753
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,440 
She's our beautiful sound healer.

754
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,480 
And we're just going to experience this
for a moment of time.

755
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,360 
Oh, my God, look at them.

756
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,200 
Like something from <i>The Handmaid's Tale.</i>

757
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,920 
I have made as much small talk
as I can with these people.

758
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,480 
I mean, what cult is this?

759
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,320 
I don't think I can do this.

760
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,760 
What? No.

761
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,040 
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. I can't.

762
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,760 
-What are you gonna do?
-Go home.

763
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,400 
See you. Bye, babe.

764
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,200 
I've never been to a party
where there was sound healing before.

765
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,920 
And it's really, really cool.
It's something else.

766
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,040 
<i>We are love</i>

767
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,600 
<i>We are love</i>

768
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,880 
<i>We are love</i>

769
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,480 
<i>And the kindle is within</i>

770
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,160 
I find it really funny

771
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,000 
Hannah's done a sound healing
the second I walk into the party.

772
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,880 
Maybe it's so she can chill me out
so I don't go at her as hard.

773
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,720 
How does everybody feel?

774
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,880 
Fabulous.

775
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,560 
-Great.
-Hi, guys.

776
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,320 
Grateful. Blessed.

777
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,520 
Hannah's in the wrong.

778
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,520 
And I'm going to have a conversation
and get this apology that I need from her.

779
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,680 
If you do something wrong, own it.

780
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,600 
Do you want to have a chat?

781
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,880 
Let's not fuck around.

782
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,080 
-'Cause shit got really nasty.
-Yeah.

783
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,800 
Should we get straight into it?

784
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,600 
I do want Hannah in my life.

785
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,560 
I don't want to deal with her bullshit.

786
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,800 
If she doesn't give me an apology,
our friendship is over.

787
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,520 
You obviously got me here tonight
to resolve this issue, right?

788
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,440 
Yeah.

789
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,960 
So I was out at dinner
with two people after work,

790
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,440 
and I just feel like
I got attacked by you.

791
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,640 
Well…

792
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,960 
The messages… were rude.

793
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,840 
Right? They were rude.

794
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,760 
I felt like you went really crazy at me.

795
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,120 
I felt disrespected by it.

796
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,480 
When you sent me those messages,
I literally was like, "Yuck."

797
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,600 
When I saw you out at the bar,
I could feel your anger.

798
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,840 
-And you acted like a psychopath.
-I tried to run away.

799
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,280 
You were out of line.

800
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,440 
And I felt really fucking angry.

801
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,080 
I know. I'm not going to deny it.
I did act a little crazy.

802
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,600 
So…

803
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,680 
Am I gonna get an apology?

804
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,920 
Look, I was not myself during that time.

805
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,520 
I did act a little bit crazy.

806
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,440 
I wasn't in the best headspace then.

807
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,360 
I was probably partying a little bit more.

808
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,040 
'Cause my mind wasn't clear then.

809
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,720 
Yeah. So…

810
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,200 
Yes, I…

811
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,760 
Sorry.

812
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,320 
-I am sorry.
-Sorry.

813
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,800 
Are you actually sorry?

814
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,960 
I didn't find it very sincere,
her attempt of an apology.

815
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,920 
So I just don't really know
how to take it from now on.

816
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,560 
I feel like maybe
certain things weren't said,

817
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,120 
but I'm glad we had a talk.

818
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,720 
Coming to Byron,

819
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,840 
it's a really tight-knit community,
but I just hope that

820
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,840 
I might actually fit in here.

821
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,320 
<i>I love this place.</i>

822
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,080 
<i>I'm going to enjoy being here.</i>

823
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,720 
<i>Out of everyone I met at Hannah's party,</i>

824
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,720 
<i>Jade stands out the most to me.</i>

825
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,720 
<i>There's something off about him.</i>

826
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,280 
<i>I need to get to the bottom of it.</i>

827
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,680 
<i>I'm not going to let this go.</i>
