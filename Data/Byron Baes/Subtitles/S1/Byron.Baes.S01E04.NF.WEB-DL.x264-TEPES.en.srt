1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,480
{\an8}I've travelled the whole world.

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,360 
He's in there
trying to discredit me and what I'm doing.

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,080 
Are you for real? Where the fuck…
I'll show him my Instagram right now.

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,440 
I'll go in there and show him
my fucking Instagram right now

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,080 
and say, "What the fuck is your problem?"

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,640 
Alex is saying I purchased my followers.
That's a fucking shit go.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800 
<i>He's trying to ruin my business</i>
<i>that I've worked very hard for.</i>

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,080 
It's not on.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,520 
You're a bully and bullies
need to be fucking called out

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200 
and that's what I'm going to do.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,600 
Just so you know,
something's about to happen.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,360 
There you are.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,840 
-I was talking about you.
-We were.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,280 
-You were? How coincidental.
-Yeah.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,800 
-What is your problem?
-Your response is very aggressive.

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,560 
Alex, you tried to manage me
so many times. I have the emails.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,560 
-Come on.
-Babe!

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,000 
You tried to gain me as talent.
I said, "No."

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,040 
-Pull the emails up.
-100% you know.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,640 
-Pull the emails up.
-I will.

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,560 
And guess what? I'll show everybody.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,920 
It's pathetic
what you've done. It's disgusting.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,800 
I have followers all around the world.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,920 
-You're coming after my business?
-I'm asking you a question.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,640 
I told you what my response was.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,040 
I'm not satisfied with it.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,480 
Well, guess what?

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,120 
All the talent you have have done
jack shit compared to what I have.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040 
Guess what you should do?

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,160 
You should take your talent to Turkey,

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,600 
get 1,2 million followers from Turkey
so they can do what I've done.

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,080 
You're a disgrace
on behalf of you, your talent.

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,720 
-You're a waste of time--
-Don't say that. That's mean.

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,320 
Sarah, don't get involved.

35
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,240 
-He's my friend.
-Don't get involved.

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,000 
You literally told me
you met him two weeks ago.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,960 
-Yeah.
-He's not your friend, sweetie.

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,520 
-He's not your friend.
-What's the benchmark for being friends?

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,320 
You met him two weeks ago.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,040 
-We're friends.
-Don't be aggressive.

41
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,240 
I want to defend him.

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,360 
Don't be aggressive.

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,840 
You keep repeating that,
but it doesn't mean we're not friends.

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,640 
You should be ashamed of yourself.

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,160 
You're going to be the most hated person
and I didn't want that for you.

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,880 
Guys, honestly,
we're taking away from Cai's event.

47
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,040 
This should be about Cai
not you two arguing. So, let's cut it.

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,600 
That was heated.

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,200
{\an8}Jade's up here. Living his life,
doing his thing

50
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,320
{\an8}and this person is a hater.

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280 
Why is he so concerned
with everyone else's businesses?

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,000 
Build your own fucking business.

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,120 
He's a toxic person
and doesn't really have many friends.

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,120 
Sarah is Alex's only friend
in the group at this point.

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,200 
But I think that's going to
bite her on the ass.

56
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,840 
-Sarah.
-She was defending Alex.

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,320 
-That was awkward.
-No.

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,080 
You've been friends
for two weeks, step aside.

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,960
{\an8}To be honest,
I don't know Sarah, I've met her twice.

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,760
{\an8}Said hello. Does anyone know her?

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,400 
I've seen her so much
but I didn't have a connection.

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,880 
And I felt nothing towards her.

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,760 
-Hannah, do you like her?
-Yes.

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,680 
-Really?
-Yeah.

65
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,720 
-Wait, you've been hanging out, have you?
-Yeah.

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,600 
I just think she's new to Byron Bay.

67
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,240 
She's trying to fit in.

68
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,080 
There's a difference between new and fake.

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,320 
Yeah.

70
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,280 
Sarah, she's just moved here.

71
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,480 
I don't believe in excluding someone
without even knowing them.

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,760 
I actually thought Sarah was super sweet.

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,920 
And then she said, looking at Nathan,

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,840 
"He took me out but I was wearing
underpants. So, it wasn't a date."

75
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,400 
There's obviously something
a bit tweaky going on.

76
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,080 
She said,
"I have underpants on." That's cold.

77
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,280 
She kind of sounds tacky.

78
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,680 
Honestly, there's something fake there.

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,200 
I know where my standards and values are
with my friends I associate myself with.

80
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,320 
And that is not resonant
with my friend group.

81
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,280 
-Hello!
-Hi. How are you, mate?

82
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,640 
-I have your print.
-Oh, my gosh!

83
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,880 
Thank you.

84
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,920 
What's cracking, beautiful human being?

85
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,200 
Off the back end of my exhibition,
I sold quite a few works. I'm stoked.

86
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,720 
-Beautiful place that you have.
-Thank you.

87
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,400 
Me and Simba went over to Alex's place
to drop off the prints he bought.

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,480 
Cai obviously makes himself
very much at home here.

89
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,480 
Look at him. He's laying down,
having a little chill sesh.

90
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,920 
I love this couch so much.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,280 
Not many people are even trying
to see his side of the story.

92
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,440 
And Alex has been a good person to me.

93
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,280 
He also is the reason
why I can eat food this week

94
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,000 
because he bought my prints.

95
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,800 
So, the least I can do is be a G for him.

96
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,600 
I just thought I'd pop by
and see how you were doing.

97
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,800 
-And make sure you were sweet.
-Well, I had the crystal out.

98
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,920 
I feel there's a lot
of energy in this crystal.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,720 
And I need it at the moment.

100
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,720 
I need all the repairing,
healing I can get.

101
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800 
Healing after what? The exhibition?

102
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,080 
Oh, my God. After your exhibition. I know.

103
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,000 
I did feel bad about that. I did not plan
for it to be some huge explosion.

104
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,720 
I think maybe I misread Jade,
because I thought that

105
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,680 
he wanted to have a conversation with me

106
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,480 
and give me the benefit of the doubt.
And he was being sweet.

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,360 
So, I thought that,
my question in that environment…

108
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,920 
He'd go, "Thanks for giving me
the benefit of the doubt."

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,240 
"Let me tell you X, Y, Z." That's the
response I thought was going to happen.

110
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,400 
Holy shit.

111
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,880 
The fucking tsunami that came at me.

112
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,280 
I went and talked to my Nana and Pop.
They were standing quite close to you.

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120 
And my Nana comes up and goes,

114
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,880 
"I think they're fighting
about something about followers."

115
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,160 
-"What are followers?"
-So sweet.

116
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,640 
How are you feeling?

117
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,320 
It upset me to see how upset he got.

118
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,440 
Because deep, deep, deep, deep down,

119
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,880 
-I'm a nice person. It's just buried.
-Yeah.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360 
You could basically drill for oil
before you find the nice person.

121
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,360 
I hope that kind of all works itself out

122
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,840 
because Byron is a small town,
we're all in the same industry and stuff.

123
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,000 
Yeah.

124
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,520 
There's a lot of negative vibes
going around right now

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,640 
and it's causing
a lot of disharmony in the group.

126
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,840 
So as a holistic health
and spiritual coach,

127
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,440 
my mission in life is to heal others.

128
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,960 
I think it could be a really
good chance for me to step in,

129
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,520 
bring everybody together,
and heal their grudges.

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,160 
I made a really awesome plan.
Just to bring a few people together.

131
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,400 
And create a space for a bit of
a deeper spiritual connection together.

132
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,800 
Getting to the bottom of things
that are slightly in the shadows.

133
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,320 
And bring them to the surface.

134
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,000 
I've seen what you've done.
I've talked to people

135
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,440 
that you've worked with and
the fire twirling and everything…

136
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,480 
I'm so excited to be a part of this.

137
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,560 
Fire is the primordial element
for creation and destruction.

138
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,240 
<i>It is that which burns away the deadwood</i>

139
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,880 
<i>and makes space for something</i>
<i>new and beautiful.</i>

140
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,240 
And it's my way to help other people
with their health.

141
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,600 
And inspire some level of emotion.

142
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,480 
This is a beautiful thing
that I wanted to…

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,320 
give to you. Almost as a gift, right?

144
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,560 
-See, all that sounds great.
-Yeah.

145
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,040 
But also terrifies me
because I don't know if you've noticed,

146
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,520 
but I've pissed a lot of people off
in a very short time. So…

147
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,880 
It's gonna be an opportunity
to come together,

148
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,320 
and start this healing process.

149
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,040 
Can't wait to be there.

150
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,160 
I appreciate that Simba thinks it's gonna
bring Jade and I closer together.

151
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,240 
But the only thing
that'll bring Jade and I closer together

152
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,760 
is an answer to my question.

153
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,080 
Oh, my God. Last night.

154
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,640 
What a nightmare.
Literally, what a nightmare.

155
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,360 
I knew there was something up
with that Alex guy from day dot.

156
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,320 
And I feel that the way I handled myself
and went at him might've been aggressive.

157
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,360 
I'm still gonna stand my ground
'cause like, "Don't fuck around."

158
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,960 
I didn't think it was aggressive.

159
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,880 
It was totally fair how you reacted.

160
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,440 
He was trying
to pull you down to his level.

161
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,000 
People do that. They get jealous,
they see your success,

162
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,520 
they want to try and act
as if you got it handed to you--

163
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,840 
That's why it upset me.

164
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,920 
Because I felt he was trying
to take away how hard I've worked.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,480 
If Alex is gonna come for me, I'm ready.
I'm not going to be disrespected.

166
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,120 
And I won't have my mood
and my energy affected.

167
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440 
I'm already talking
like a Byron Bay person.

168
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,039 
Should have a crystal around my neck.

169
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,840 
How do you feel about Sarah?

170
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,480 
'Cause I was shocked
that she was so on Alex's side.

171
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,760 
-I know.
-And he was so in the wrong.

172
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,840 
But Sarah was telling you not to yell.

173
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,040 
-And I judged her off that.
-Right?

174
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,080 
Yeah.

175
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,800 
Sarah's behavior just doesn't
go down well in a small town.

176
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,320 
She needs to be careful.

177
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,280 
She's going to
cause a lot of trouble for herself.

178
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,680 
Hello.

179
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,840 
Hi, babe.

180
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,840 
-Hi. How are you?
-How are you?

181
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,960 
Hannah is so great.

182
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,800 
She's been reaching out to me and wanting
to spend some time to get to know me.

183
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,160 
-Welcome. Thank you.
-This is beautiful.

184
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,720 
My family and I are known
for our brand Bisque.

185
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,680 
I wanted to put Sarah in some
Bisque clothes to help her fit in a bit.

186
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,000 
You know when someone
is not from Byron, as in a Goldie,

187
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,280 
it's like spray-on dresses, high heels,
fake eyelashes, big lips, fake tits…

188
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,880 
So, I have my beautiful linens.

189
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,600 
We can just play dress-up.

190
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,560 
Okay.

191
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,040 
This is
quintessentially Byron kind of vibes.

192
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,920 
I keep hearing "Byron vibes,"
"that's so Byron." What is Byron?

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000 
Byron is flowy, quite a lot of neutrals.

194
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,520 
You let the goddess shine.

195
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,640 
That's nice.

196
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,400 
So…

197
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,320 
I was thinking to get you
in a gorgeous little--

198
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,760 
-Does that go with that?
-Top and the pants.

199
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,000 
-That's pretty.
-Yeah.

200
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,400 
Don't know if it'll look good,
but I'll try it.

201
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,720 
The clothes that Hannah picked for me,

202
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,920 
it's not something
I'm vibing with at the moment,

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,120 
but when in Byron…

204
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,400 
Wear some fucking linen.

205
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,400 
You look stunning.

206
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,040 
Oh, my God! You babe!

207
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200 
-Do I look like a Byron girl now?
-Yeah!

208
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,600 
You look just beautiful.

209
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,320 
Really?

210
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,280 
Thank you!

211
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,640 
I jumped in and told Sarah
what the girls were saying at Cai's

212
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,640 
'cause I felt sorry for her
and that she needed to know the truth.

213
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,800 
I wanna hear from your side,
'cause I was talking to the girls later.

214
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,760 
-I heard you were taking Alex's side.
-Yeah.

215
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,600 
He's my friend. So, I feel like I want
to protect him if he's being attacked.

216
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,840 
This is the thing with those girls…

217
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,600 
they tend to take sides.

218
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,280 
They've become better friends with Jade
and with you sticking up for Alex,

219
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,680 
they're basically being like,
"We can't trust her."

220
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,440 
If people don't like me now

221
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,160 
'cause of me trying
to just diffuse that whole situation,

222
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,440 
what do I do about that?

223
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,360 
Yeah.

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,760 
I don't know what to do here.
It's high school bullshit.

225
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,040 
Well, I appreciate you reaching out to me.

226
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,600 
I think it's really nice.
You're my only Byron girlfriend.

227
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,760 
It's my pleasure.

228
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,000 
-Here you go.
-Amazing.

229
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080 
-Thank you.
-Hey.

230
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,200 
-Hey, mate. Just in time.
-Hello.

231
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,520 
Just what the doctor ordered.

232
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,480 
Came right at the perfect time.

233
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,360 
Couldn't have thought
of a better person to come try a cocktail

234
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,240 
than the "Party Boy" himself.

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,960 
<i>So good to see Saskia and Frimmy.</i>

236
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,720 
<i>They've always got my back.</i>
<i>I appreciate that about them.</i>

237
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,400 
<i>They're like family.</i>

238
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,360 
What's been happening?

239
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,880 
Man, I've just been cruising.
Kind of just relaxing after the…

240
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,160 
-After Cai's event.
-Yeah.

241
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,640 
I seen you drag

242
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,000 
-Sarah over for a word.
-Yeah. We had a chat.

243
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,200 
She actually said that Elias said
I'm a fuckboy. I've got no substance.

244
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,240 
He apparently just fully rinsed me.

245
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,160 
Fuck.

246
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,560 
He's actually really, really annoyed me.

247
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,600 
I'm so confused.
I thought you and Elias were friends.

248
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,240 
I don't get it.

249
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,240 
Honestly, when I was speculating
who planted that seed in Sarah's head,

250
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,880 
I was like,
"There's no way it would be Elias."

251
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960 
"He would have my back."

252
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,520 
Who knows what his motive is.

253
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,600 
He's threatened by you.

254
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,080 
He wants
to steal your thunder any way he can.

255
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,400 
I just find
the whole situation really immature.

256
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,920 
It feels constantly like
Sarah causes drama. I feel like…

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,840 
I don't know why she's doing this to
two guys who are meant to be friends.

258
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,320 
She told me that
on the night of Cai's exhibition.

259
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,560 
After all the drama between Alex and Jade,
I'm like, "I won't bring it up here."

260
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,960 
-Yeah.
-I was like, "I'll let it run for now.

261
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040 
"But I'll have to say something to Elias."

262
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,320 
I reckon Elias has an issue with me.

263
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,640 
It's because he's jealous
and he wants Sarah to like him and not me.

264
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,200 
And honestly,
I think he's pathetic and insecure.

265
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,200 
I'm not going to stand for this shit.

266
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,680 
Dude, this place is so beautiful
every time I come inside.

267
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,360 
Simba really wants
to have this night with everyone

268
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,360 
to bring things up to the surface
that've been bubbling up.

269
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,640 
Hopefully get to a point
we can let them go.

270
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,120 
What can we help you set up now?

271
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,960 
There's all these cushions
and blankets over there.

272
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,680 
It feels like Sim's very tuned
into everything that kind of goes on.

273
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,880 
He's seen a lot of energies
and he wants to re-ground everyone

274
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,520 
or find a way to help do that.

275
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120 
-Yeah.
-Koby.

276
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,400 
My man.

277
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,560 
I talked to Nathan the other day.

278
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,240 
And he's pretty…
I think he's a little bit upset with you.

279
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,440 
-Why is he upset?
-'Cause he talked to Sarah.

280
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,520 
-Yeah?
-And…

281
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,960 
Sarah told him
you said the "Fuckboy" call.

282
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,000 
Is that true?

283
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,120 
She asked me if he's a bit of a fuckboy.

284
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,040 
And?

285
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,360 
I was just like, "Yeah."

286
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,280 
-It's Nathan…
-Shit.

287
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,240 
I don't want Sarah
being hurt or fucked around.

288
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360 
He's pretty upset.

289
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,000 
-I don't know why…
-He was upset when we talked.

290
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,160 
It's his behavior.

291
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,600 
If you're upset by your own behavior,

292
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,760 
and people calling you out
for something you do,

293
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,400 
then maybe you should change
your behavior as opposed to

294
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,960 
trying to pose as something else.

295
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,840 
There's nothing wrong with being
young and promiscuous.

296
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,360 
When you've kind of
stepped on people to do that

297
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,520 
and then try to portray
this "sweet boy" thing it's a bit weird.

298
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,400 
Fuck! Preach Lord! That's pretty hardcore.

299
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,480 
There's obviously so much shit
between these two.

300
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,960 
Shit. First Alex and Jade,
and now we've got you two.

301
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,720 
I feel kind of protective over Sarah.
I don't want to see her get hurt.

302
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,840 
So, darl. What sort of vibe
are we going for tonight?

303
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,560 
It's a little bit different
from what you've seen me in.

304
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,880 
Hannah took me into her shop
and gave me a bunch of outfits to try.

305
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,280 
Obviously, I've put my little twist on it.

306
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,520 
It's different for you. I can see
where Hannah stops and you begin.

307
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,720 
It's cute.

308
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,520 
Why did she feel
the need to make you over?

309
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,280 
I don't know, but when I went to her shop…

310
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,200 
she told me that all the girls
are talking shit about me.

311
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,560 
Are you actually serious?

312
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,560 
Hannah said the girls are shitty that

313
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,840 
I took your side and stood up for you
when you and Jade fought.

314
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,720 
And Elle said she thought I was fake.

315
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,680 
I feel like I'm in high school again.

316
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,240 
-I know.
-You know? They're trying to stir shit.

317
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,400 
That's my role.

318
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,000 
-I know. There can only be one bitch.
-That's my thing.

319
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,440 
Bitches stepping on my fucking land.

320
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,000 
What upsets me is Sarah is out there,
doing what she wants,

321
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,520 
she's wearing what she wants
and power to her.

322
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,800 
To be dragged down by these people…

323
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,119 
<i>Not about it.</i>

324
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,680 
But I have Sarah's back.
She had mine with Jade,

325
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,319 
and I have no problem
going into bat for her.

326
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400 
If the girls come for Sarah at this party…

327
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920 
I'm coming for them.

328
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,400 
Obviously, you're gonna see Jade tonight.

329
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,400 
I'm gonna see Jade.
I have no idea what his response--

330
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,760 
Are you gonna go in for round two
or leave it?

331
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,560 
Far as I'm concerned, I asked a question,
I don't have an answer.

332
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,440 
I get it's a sore point for him and
something he doesn't want to talk about.

333
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,960 
But it's still the elephant in the room.

334
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,280 
It's a Turkish elephant
in the room, really.

335
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,320 
Although Jade may not see it like this,
I'm actually doing him a favor.

336
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,840 
Because he's going to have to
address this sometime in his career.

337
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,880 
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. We'll do some more in the car.

338
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,560 
This is incredible.

339
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,440 
-Hello! Oh, my God!
-Welcome!

340
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,480 
This is amazing!

341
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,600 
How are you?

342
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,040 
Nowhere to be, but here.

343
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,240 
Oh, my gosh!

344
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,520 
-Oh, my God!
-What a pleasure.

345
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,080 
I wanna let loose
and not have any negativity,

346
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,160 
or anyone that will come in
and create drama and chaos.

347
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,880 
So, just spread your arms out like that,
close your eyes,

348
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,680 
drop into the presence of your body.

349
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,040 
The sound of the drum.

350
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,760 
Be right here, right now.
There's nowhere else to be.

351
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,920 
If there were any demons on me…

352
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,200 
Those demons are definitely gone now.

353
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,520 
-Hello, my beautiful.
-This is beautiful.

354
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,120 
-Thank you.
-This is magic.

355
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,040 
Thank you so much for being here.

356
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,040 
Is there any beverage?

357
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,160 
-Have we got any beverages?
-Yes. We're going to have a cacao.

358
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,920 
We're gonna have a beautifully brewed,
organic cacao I've brewed myself.

359
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,800 
It increases energy,
grounds you, it opens your heart,

360
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,680 
so you're able to connect
and move and be in the body.

361
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,520 
Yes.

362
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,200 
There's no bevvies.

363
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,440 
I was so disappointed.

364
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,560 
If I've ever needed a big, cold glass
of Savvy B in my life, it is right now.

365
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,960 
Welcome, welcome.

366
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,120 
-Hi.
-How are you?

367
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480 
I'm good. How are you?

368
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,120 
In your body. Into your spine.

369
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,160 
And turn around.

370
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,480 
I feel repulsed.

371
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,480 
-You okay?
-Instantly, my vibe is just ruined.

372
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,280 
And I hate how I'm like…

373
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,280 
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

374
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,720 
If Alex is going
to come for me, I'm ready.

375
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,280 
I'll pop off from zero to 20
and I won't come down to one.

376
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,760 
I'm not going to be disrespected
like that anymore.

377
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,720 
Not happening.

378
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,480 
Is that the dress you gave her?

379
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,680 
Yeah!
She's turned it into Gladiator Woman.

380
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,920 
I don't know
what she was thinking with that bra.

381
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,560 
You can't take
the Gold Coast out of some girls.

382
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,760 
Yeah. How you feeling about
everything since last week

383
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,760 
and the run-in you had with Jade?

384
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,760 
Look, I…

385
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,240 
-Deep down, I don't like upsetting people.
-Yeah.

386
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,880 
It wasn't my intention
to personally upset him.

387
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,080 
-Yeah.
-It was a genuine question

388
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,840 
coming from a genuine place.

389
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,640 
I said, "I want to give you
the chance to explain."

390
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,640 
You know. You've got a great audience.

391
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,120 
You've built that up over time
and energy and effort.

392
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,320 
How'd you feel if someone just bought
your audience and you lost work to it?

393
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,520 
Elias is an example
of what an influencer should be.

394
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,120 
And people like Jade, whose audience
aren't what they say they are,

395
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,240 
makes people like Elias look bad.

396
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,680 
Yeah, I get it.

397
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,320 
I still don't think
you should just call someone out.

398
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,880 
It's numbers. I spend all day doing this.

399
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,400 
To qualify everyone.

400
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,800 
Oh, my God. Here he is again.

401
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,720 
He's talking about me.

402
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,800 
Hey, sorry, I hear everyone's having
a chat about me.

403
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,440 
I'd love to be involved.

404
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,200 
And we're going to go again

405
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,680 
because you just can't
stop fucking speaking about me.

406
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,960 
Stop speaking about me.

407
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,080 
It was mean,
it was hurtful and it was nasty.

408
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,520 
Why did you say that?

409
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,440 
Just a question.

410
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,840 
It's not just a question.
You're smarter than that.

411
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,240 
Come on, Alex. Don't be stupid.

412
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,880 
Sure, it's a loaded question.
But it is still a question, right?

413
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,000 
I've gone out of my way
to try and be your friend.

414
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,840 
It wasn't a personal attack, Jade.
It was a question.

415
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,280 
How can I not take that
as a personal attack?

416
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,160 
-I don't know where--
-It wasn't.

417
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,560 
I don't know where you come from
and what you think.

418
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,120 
But if you're gonna go
throwing shit like that,

419
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,080 
you're gonna have a big issue with me.

420
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,640 
We're gonna have a problem.

421
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,200 
Let's embrace
the good energy that is here.

422
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,080 
-There's enough crystals for good energy.
-To heal fucking anything.

423
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,640 
Let's absorb the good energy and try and…

424
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,880 
-Okay.
-Be happy.

425
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,000 
-Have a good night.
-Thank you.

426
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,160 
Jade's response to my question
has been really emotional and aggressive.

427
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,360 
Oh, my God!

428
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,720 
I love you.

429
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,360 
I fucking love you.

430
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,920 
Look who it is!

431
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,080 
-What's doing?
-What's happening?

432
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,600 
You got the memo?

433
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,040 
-Yeah, it's cracklin'.
-Shit.

434
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,240 
Ever since I heard
that Elias said I was a fuckboy to Sarah,

435
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,720 
I've been feeling really hurt.

436
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,080 
I wouldn't do that to someone.

437
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,040 
I don't know why he thinks
he can get away with doing it to me.

438
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,600 
-Take a spot near the fire.
-Yeah. Beautiful.

439
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,480 
-Relax and settle in.
-Thank you.

440
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,680 
How's that?

441
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,120 
Getting the drum beat by Elias.

442
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,240 
It's upset you. So…

443
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,080 
I think we need to get that sage
and smoke the shit out of you.

444
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,160 
Bless each other.

445
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,640 
Might as well talk it out and sort it out?

446
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,920 
Yeah, just go.

447
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,120 
-Yes, Mom and Dad.
-We got your back.

448
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,320 
El.

449
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,800 
Reckon we can have a little chat?

450
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880 
-Yeah. Is that all right?
-Yeah. Let's do it.

451
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040 
They're going. Okay.

452
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,080 
At least they're talking now.

453
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,480 
-How you been?
-Yeah, mate.

454
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,480 
Look, we're friends, right?

455
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,600 
I've got your back
and supposedly you have mine.

456
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,880 
At Cai's exhibition, right?

457
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,280 
-Yeah.
-I sat down and had a chat with Sarah.

458
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,760 
And she's got this idea that I'm a fuckboy
and I've got no substance.

459
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,000 
-Yeah.
-I asked her where she got the idea from.

460
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,520 
She actually said that she asked you
a few questions, and you actually said,

461
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,080 
"Yeah. Nathan's a fuckboy.
He's got no substance."

462
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,720 
Whatever else was said.

463
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,840 
She asked me a direct question.

464
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,480 
She goes, "My initial read of Nathan
was that he's a bit of a fuckboy. Is he?"

465
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,680 
I'm like, "Yeah, he is. He's promiscuous."

466
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,280 
Oh, my God!

467
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,600 
You are, by nature, since I've known you.

468
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600 
Oh, my God. You're fucking… Okay.

469
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,120 
If you think I'm this fuckboy,
then stop being my friend.

470
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,520 
Because the nights, for you,
seem to always go in one direction.

471
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,120 
-You're a young dude.
-Oh, my God!

472
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,840 
Being promiscuous
is not the worst thing in the world.

473
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,520 
He's a known fuckboy
and this isn't any new information.

474
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400 
Dude, why are you constantly
running away from this thing

475
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,320 
and constantly acting out that character?

476
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,000 
Why do you kind of call people out?
What is your problem?

477
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,320 
It's different when
someone asks you a question.

478
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,840 
Let me live my life and you live yours.

479
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,080 
If someone wants to get close to you,
what they're basing everything on is like,

480
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,520 
"Is he like this or is he not?"
I won't be like, "No. He's not."

481
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,120 
You know what? How about this?

482
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,400 
I've got a true opinion of you in my head.

483
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,480 
You're an egotistical fuck.

484
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,160 
And I also think that you are
seriously, seriously insecure.

485
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,080 
You're an idiot.

486
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,440 
It's frustrating and it blows my mind.

487
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,280 
I feel like he was trying
to get between Sarah and I.

488
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,880 
He's never gonna apologize.

489
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,600 
He lives his life
in the only way that he thinks is correct.

490
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,160 
And is unapologetic about it.

491
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,640 
You don't do this to people.

492
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,120 
Are you okay?

493
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,680 
Come here. What happened? I heard you.

494
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,200 
No. It's actually…

495
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,600 
-Well, you seem frustrated--
-No. He's got a real opinion of me.

496
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,440 
-It's pissing me off.
-What is his opinion of you?

497
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,200 
He's just hammering me with like,

498
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440 
"You are the fuckboy. You are…"

499
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,360 
-He's saying that to you?
-Yeah, sitting there right now.

500
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,360 
He's sitting there
saying you're a fuckboy?

501
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,720 
If that's how you're gonna act
and what you do, roll with it.

502
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,720 
Be the fun, party fuckboy.
Whatever you want to be.

503
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,520 
Why go spend all this time
trying to paint another picture

504
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,920 
and try to build this other persona
that's not in line with your actions?

505
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,280 
How about you come and get to know me?

506
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,520 
-That's not nice.
-You don't know who I am.

507
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,840 
I'd rather have an enemy talk shit
about me than a friend talk shit.

508
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,760 
No.

509
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,160 
Do you feel like what happened
was tit for tat?

510
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,160 
-Do you feel like--
-The whole conversation felt like that.

511
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,560 
Both of you entered that space and--

512
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,840 
Yeah and he said,
"I think you're egotistical and insecure."

513
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,520 
End of the day, it shows how weak he is

514
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,080 
and how insecure he is
and how unstable he is.

515
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,720 
It took me by surprise
that he's going to throw something

516
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,760 
so sensitive in my face, regardless
of the truth of the matter or not.

517
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,920 
It's a dog act and he's a bit of a dog.

518
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,800 
-Hey.
-Hello.

519
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,280 
-How you doing?
-How are you?

520
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,720 
There they go. Look at them.

521
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,240 
Nathan and Elias go back.
They have history.

522
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,920 
They're good friends
and since Sarah's moved to town,

523
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,240 
I think that's changed
the dynamic of their friendship.

524
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,160 
You guys all good?

525
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,360 
No. Well, I just said,

526
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,040 
"Hey, look. Apparently you think
I'm this, this, this and this."

527
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,000 
And he was like, "That's what you are."

528
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,360 
And I was like, "Well, we're friends."

529
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,560 
You know what I mean?

530
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,480 
"If that's who you think I am at least
get to know me on a deeper level."

531
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,480 
There's been so much drama.

532
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,680 
If you want to hang out,
let's go do something. Let's go have fun.

533
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,120 
Let's go hang out.

534
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,080 
I do care about you
and you know I want you to…

535
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,240 
I want you to feel welcome here
and welcome in the friendship circle.

536
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,520 
I think deep down the girls' real problem
with me is that they don't know me.

537
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,400 
And I don't think they
can be bothered getting to know me.

538
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,800 
But it seems to be how everyone
judges everyone here in Byron Bay.

539
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,760 
I do feel bad, but…

540
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840 
It just seems like
she's causing all this drama.

541
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,760 
Yeah.

542
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,840 
I think it's sad that Nathan and Elias
are fighting over Sarah

543
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,400 
because they've been friends for a while
and a girl shouldn't come between them.

544
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,520 
Just go back to the Gold Coast.

545
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,800 
We're being summoned.

546
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,920 
It's time.
The tribal council is about to speak.

547
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,960 
All right, beautiful people.
Let's all sit by the fire.

548
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,560 
Make yourself at home
in this beautiful place.

549
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,280 
There's quite a bit of drama
unfolding in the group.

550
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,840 
I can feel the energy
not being completely balanced.

551
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,720 
I want to bring people back together.

552
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,000 
Thank you so much for coming here tonight.

553
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,640 
The idea of this gathering
is to bring about a level of mindfulness,

554
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,400 
groundedness and healing
that needs to be brought into the group.

555
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,080 
We're here tonight,
surrounded by the fire elements.

556
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,560 
It correlates
to burning off the internal deadwood.

557
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,400 
There's no need for it anymore.
It can be burnt away.

558
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,200 
And that creates space
for forests, for greenery, for diversity.

559
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,560 
So, from my heart to all your hearts,

560
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320 
to the universe,

561
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,960 
thank you so much for being here tonight.

562
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,640 
-Thank you, Sim.
-Thanks, Simmy.

563
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,160 
Go, Simba.

564
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,160 
Simba!

565
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,120 
My eyes are now just like…

566
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,160 
This is just so powerful.

567
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,200 
Simba!

568
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,040 
-That was amazing.
-Oh, my God.

569
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,960 
I haven't been able to be myself in Byron.

570
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,560 
And I hate that because
I only know how to be myself.

571
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,200 
It's made me want to go home.

572
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,160 
I haven't been back to the Gold Coast
since I moved to Byron.

573
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,040 
And it's crazy how an hour up the coast
can feel like a million miles away.

574
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,760 
With all the shit that's going on,
I just really needed to come up here

575
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,520 
and be where I feel the most comfortable.

576
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,320 
Mom.

577
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,080 
-Hi!
-Hi.

578
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,960 
<i>Bonjour,</i> Sarah.

579
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,120 
How are you?

580
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,840 
-Are you hungry?
-Yeah.

581
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,400 
-Let's eat.
-Yes!

582
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,280 
My mom's from the Seychelles.

583
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,240 
So, even though
she's lived in Australia for many years,

584
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,400 
the Creole culture
is incredibly important to our family.

585
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,560 
There you go!

586
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,320 
I hope you like it.

587
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,480 
-Thank you. You're the best.
-Okay.

588
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,240 
I've felt like an outsider
so many times in my life.

589
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,680 
And that's how I've been feeling in Byron.

590
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,840 
And I know
that Mum knows exactly how I feel.

591
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,640 
-It's so nice to be here.
-Coming home?

592
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,840 
-Yeah.
-Move back home.

593
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,880 
How's the move going?

594
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,800 
Are you happy?

595
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,280 
It's been a challenge.
So, I thought, moving to Byron,

596
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,120 
I would work on my album,

597
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,000 
meet some creative people,
be able to connect.

598
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,800 
And… Yeah. It's just been pretty lonely.

599
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,800 
I've struggled a bit to…

600
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,320 
-Make friends.
-Make friends?

601
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,920 
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

602
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,600 
I hung out with one girl,
Hannah, yesterday,

603
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,000 
and she told me that the girls
have been talking shit about me.

604
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,160 
Really? That's low.

605
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,360 
-Yeah.
-That's not good.

606
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,120 
I don't know. Some days are tough

607
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,680 
and I think I want
to move back to the Gold Coast.

608
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,880 
-It's sad to hear that, love.
-Yeah.

609
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,160 
I'm so sorry.

610
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,040 
I don't know.

611
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,520 
-You want a hug?
-Yeah.

612
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,720 
Come.

613
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,200 
Poor thing.

614
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,360 
They've been making
nasty comments behind my back.

615
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,040 
It's so upsetting.

616
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,360 
And it's just making me feel like
I don't want to stay in Byron.

617
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,200 
The Sarah I know

618
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,640 
wouldn't let all these
things happen to her.

619
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,600 
Yeah.

620
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,560 
I always admired you for the way
you stand up for yourself.

621
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,000 
Yeah. I was much happier
when I took care of it myself.

622
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,040 
I always admired that in you.

623
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,800 
That's so sweet. Thanks, Mum.

624
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,680 
Mum's right. The Sarah she knows
would never put up with bullies.

625
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,680 
I've been biting my tongue
for far too long. Enough is enough.

626
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,520 
I don't want to be this person anymore.
I want to feel like me again.

627
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,960 
So, I don't know
how it's going to go down, but…

628
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,160 
we'll see what happens.
