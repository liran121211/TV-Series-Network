1
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,800 
<i>When I moved to Byron,</i>

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,680 
<i>I didn't bank on feeling</i>
<i>quite as isolated as I have done.</i>

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,280 
<i>But things were going well</i>
<i>between me and Nathan.</i>

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,800 
I was starting to feel really positive,

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,920 
and like I might actually
be able to make things work in Byron.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,720 
But everything
has just come crashing down.

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,280 
<i>Because at Jade's event,</i>
<i>Hannah drops this bomb.</i>

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,640 
What's been happening?

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760 
Just been hanging out in Byron.

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,800 
I found it interesting
that at Jade's launch on the Gold Coast,

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,280 
I've never seen you so happy.

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,880 
You were so light
and full of energy and you were proud.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,160 
I kind of didn't really realize it too,
until I was back up in my hood,

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,800 
that I've been trying to make this work,
and trying and failing.

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200 
What were you and Hannah talking about?

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,640 
It was really weird.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,480 
I don't know whether
she was trying to warn me,

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,000 
but she said Elle's talking shit about me
because she also likes Nathan.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,640 
Hannah said they've had a thing before
and something might still be happening.

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,280 
-And then immediately after--
-Wait, whoa.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,000 
Whoa.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,160 
Did you talk to Nathan about that?

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240 
No.

24
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,800 
Because when I saw Nathan,
he told me that Elle was in love with him.

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,360 
-He did tell you that?
-He told me to my face.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,920 
To me, that makes the whole situation
of him living with Elle weird.

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,600 
Wherever Nathan goes,
drama seems to follow.

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,800 
And I think Sarah needs to be on her game.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600 
<i>I don't want to see her heart broken.</i>

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040 
What does your gut say?

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,480 
I've just had enough.

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,600 
-Yeah.
-I've just had enough.

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,760 
<i>I don't want to get more</i>
<i>emotionally invested</i>

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,039 
<i>until I know whether it's true that</i>
<i>something's going on with Nathan and Elle.</i>

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,919 
This news has just sent me in a tailspin.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,160 
Am I just flogging a dead horse
by staying here?

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,280 
Because at this point, I don't know
who to believe, I don't know who to trust.

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,760 
I don't know, like…
I just don't want to see you sad.

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,240 
And I've seen you sad
the last couple of weeks.

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,800 
Yeah.

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,560 
You came here with a purpose, right?

42
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,240 
You wanted to get inspired,
to write music, and I just can't stand…

43
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,240 
If you're not doing that,
then what are you doing?

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,000 
The last thing I want
is for you to go, but…

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,720 
You need to decide
what's going to make you happy.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,720 
Yeah, I have a lot of thinking to do.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,480 
This decision is so massive

48
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,320 
because I haven't felt this way
about a boy in such a long time.

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,120 
<i>I think I need to speak to Nathan</i>
<i>and Elle. I just really want them to admit</i>

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200 
if something has happened between them.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,840 
<i>Mate, honestly, Jade's tan launch…</i>

52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,440 
That was such a well done event.

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,560 
Some hunky dudes
giving us drinks and food.

54
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,080 
Even Sarah was just
fully coming out of her shell.

55
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160 
Yeah, I saw that.

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,120 
Yeah, she was like… I've never seen her
so in her element, so happy to be there.

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,040 
But it was also a bit worrying

58
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,800 
because I can understand why she'd want to
move back to the Gold Coast.

59
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,760 
The more I'm hanging out with Sarah,
the more I'm starting to fall for her.

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,880 
<i>As scary as it is, I need to show Sarah</i>
<i>how much I care for her.</i>

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,840 
I've organized a party. In the hinterlands
overlooking the mountains and…

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,720 
Shake up some cocktails for everyone.
Get all our friends around.

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,440 
We're all going to get dressed up
as our best Byron selves,

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,800 
which Sarah is going to nail, I know.

65
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,720 
Yeah.

66
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,520 
You're doing the right thing.
Being welcoming. And that's good.

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,640 
<i>I'm hoping that this is going to be</i>
<i>the turning point for Sarah,</i>

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,720 
where everyone shows her
that she is welcome

69
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,480 
<i>and she's actually gonna give Byron a go.</i>

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,240 
I'm still scared that
she's going to bail back up to Goldie.

71
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,640 
Totally. The sense of home
is hard to get rid of,

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,480 
you know what I mean, and that's her home.
That's her place that she loves.

73
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,800 
I've never seen Nathan
like this with a girl.

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,280 
<i>This is a big deal for him.</i>
<i>He's putting energy into this one.</i>

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,640 
I really hope
he doesn't get his heart broken.

76
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,640 
At this point, I'm doing everything I can
to keep her here

77
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,320 
and get her to feel comfortable
and start to love Byron.

78
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,680 
-And love the people in Byron, as well.
-Totally.

79
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,880 
<i>I feel like everything</i>
<i>literally hinges on this party.</i>

80
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,120 
Because I really want
Sarah to stay in Byron

81
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,600 
and ultimately,
I want her to be my girlfriend.

82
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,240 
There's a whale. Did you see that?

83
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,800 
-What?
-I just saw it.

84
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,360 
-They're jumping out. Incredible.
-So beautiful.

85
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,400 
I can't believe
how amazing this view is. It's insane.

86
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,120 
It's so nice.

87
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,320 
Thanks for coming to my launch.

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,880 
-It was so good.
-It was amazing.

89
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,920 
So much fun.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800 
My tan launch was such a massive success.

91
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,040 
<i>I could not have expected it</i>
<i>to go any better.</i>

92
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,720 
The topless waiters were hot but bulky.

93
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800 
-I was like, "Whoa!"
-It was a different type.

94
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,600 
More Gold Coasty, I think.

95
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,840 
-Yeah.
-They had bums.

96
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,280 
-And like…
-"They had, like, bums."

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,440 
If anyone's doing something extra,
it'd be you.

98
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,280 
The tan launch in the Goldie was hectic.

99
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,160 
I felt like we kind of got

100
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,480 
trapped in a convo with Elle
and all of that shit happened.

101
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,080 
And she doesn't really understand
why we're upset.

102
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,000 
Yeah.

103
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,840 
But I mean, with Hannah, it was ridiculous
what is going on between them.

104
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,360 
Elle has a major problem with Hannah.

105
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,240 
But Hannah was dropping truth bombs
about Elle everywhere on the boat.

106
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,400 
Hannah just comes in like a Navy officer,

107
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,480 
just had a full rig of
those belts with bombs,

108
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,840 
just going bomb, bomb, bomb!

109
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,720 
There was one point when she said,

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,040 
"Nathan told me
that Elle wanted to hook up with him

111
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,760 
and tried to, and he said no."

112
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,760 
-Bomb!
-Yeah.

113
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,640 
-My jaw…
-I know.

114
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,640 
She said that, and I was like, "When?"
And she said, "Recently."

115
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,480 
I just wonder if Stav knows.

116
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,000 
-Yeah.
-No.

117
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,280 
Elle was running around saying,
"Stav and I might get engaged."

118
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,600 
Does Stav know that just a few weeks ago
you tried to hook up with your roommate?

119
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240 
Bomb!

120
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,200 
Well, I would love to believe
that whatever happened

121
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,000 
about the Elle situation was not true.

122
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,840 
With her trying to hook up with Nathan.
But that came from Nathan.

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,960 
I know.

124
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,680 
-I feel sorry for Sarah, you know?
-Yeah.

125
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,680 
Elle's relationship would be struggling
because of her feelings with Nathan.

126
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,800 
It's pretty weird living
in the same house all together,

127
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,000 
watching him with a new girl.
That would be driving her insane.

128
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,920 
<i>Wondering how it's gonna go down.</i>
<i>It just is a disaster.</i>

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,600 
-This is wild.
-So wild.

130
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,800 
-It's nice to finally have you over.
-Thank you for having me.

131
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,920 
-It's nice to finally see your house.
-Yeah.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000 
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>I've actually been to Nathan's place</i>

133
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,200 
because it's so awkward around Elle.

134
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,200 
-Is Elle here?
-Yeah, Elle's here.

135
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,440 
-Does she know I'm here?
-Yeah, I think so. Which is fine.

136
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,720 
-Okay.
-Is it not?

137
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,240 
After all of the drama, the rumors
and gossip about Elle and Nathan,

138
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320 
I'm starting to second-guess
Nathan's character.

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,160 
Everything went pretty smoothly
yesterday at Jade's tan launch.

140
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,200 
-Yeah.
-And the girls were being nice.

141
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,680 
-Yeah.
-You didn't get a chance to speak to Elle.

142
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,880 
No.

143
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,480 
Yeah, there's definitely that fear element

144
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,240 
of me not wanting to bring Sarah
over to my place

145
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,000 
because Elle can make it so awkward
and make people feel so unwelcome.

146
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,520 
<i>And, honestly, I don't know</i>
<i>what to expect from this, you know?</i>

147
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,640 
-It's a chance for us all to have a chat.
-Yeah.

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,480 
Clear the air.

149
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,600 
To be honest, I really need to know

150
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,800 
<i>if Nathan and Elle</i>
<i>are romantically involved.</i>

151
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,200 
So I'm going to confront them and just
find out what's going on once and for all.

152
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,040 
-Hi.
-Yummy.

153
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,320 
I'm surprised to see you here. But happy.

154
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,960 
I'm glad we get to sit down
and finally talk.

155
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,080 
-Yeah, me too.
-Yeah.

156
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,559 
It's good to have her around.

157
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,040 
I know.

158
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,280 
I didn't want it to feel like
it was awkward in your own house.

159
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,160 
-But I know you guys will be all good.
-Yeah.

160
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,520 
Yeah, I'm so sorry for all of that.

161
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,320 
I totally understand
how all of that may have made you feel

162
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,520 
because I am now sort of
on the receiving end of that same behavior

163
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080 
and everyone ganging up on me now.

164
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,960 
I don't want to have
any animosity between you and I.

165
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,560 
I don't.

166
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,600 
But all the girls around me

167
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,320 
are basically trying
to pin all of this on me.

168
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,440 
I just do not want
to have anything to do with Hannah.

169
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,000 
She's completely lost
all my respect. Completely.

170
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,000 
Interesting that you say that,

171
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720 
because Hannah came up
and spoke to me yesterday

172
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,640 
and had stuff to say about you guys.

173
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,720 
Hannah said to me
that you guys have a romantic history.

174
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,520 
Oh, my God.

175
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,480 
And that something
might still be going on.

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,080 
That's nothing new.
Every single day we go out.

177
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,320 
We always rock up to the events together
because we live together.

178
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,480 
We're always in each other's pockets
because we're such good friends.

179
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,640 
People just say, "You guys…"
Like, they pin that on us all the time.

180
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,800 
It's nothing new.

181
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,360 
-And look…
-We're not…

182
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,800 
-We're not a thing. I'm with Stav.
-Yeah.

183
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,080 
Way back…

184
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720 
Way back when we first met,
we kissed one time.

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,600 
You guys, you mean. Like, you guys kissed.

186
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,120 
That's where she's getting it from.

187
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,320 
<i>Fuck. Like, nothing's happened</i>
<i>while Sarah and I have been together.</i>

188
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,920 
The fact of the matter is,
I don't have feelings for Elle.

189
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,040 
<i>I actually only have feelings for Sarah.</i>

190
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,000 
Even if Elle and I had history before,
like, why would that even matter anyway?

191
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,400 
-You know what I mean? Like even…
-I'm in a committed relationship.

192
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,680 
-Exactly. You know?
-Nathan's with you.

193
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,680 
You have nothing to worry about.

194
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,000 
<i>I don't trust Elle one bit.</i>

195
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,360 
I just need to, like, process
everything that I've learnt today.

196
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,360 
I really so badly want to believe
that Nathan is telling the truth.

197
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,640 
All right, I gotta go home.

198
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,960 
-I've got stuff to think about.
-You've got a lot to process.

199
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,320 
But there is something about
the way Elle spoke to me.

200
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,000 
<i>I have a sneaking feeling that something's</i>
<i>still going on with Nathan and Elle.</i>

201
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,360 
I just…
I don't know where to go from here.

202
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,040 
At Jade's tan launch,
there was a lot of tension.

203
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,760 
You can be on this side.
You're in that green one.

204
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,200 
I invited everybody over to my house
so Hannah and Elle can clear the air.

205
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,440 
I got you… I got your flannel.

206
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,880 
<i>I recently went and did art therapy,</i>
<i>and that was super helpful for me.</i>

207
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,520 
So I am taking what I learned there

208
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,760 
and sort of trying to
apply that to this situation.

209
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,240 
I've got your canvas,
and we're waiting till Elle comes.

210
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,280 
And then I'll explain
what we're about to do.

211
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,240 
I love you, but this is going
to be really interesting.

212
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,240 
What? We'll see, we'll see.
But I'm here to help, guys.

213
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,560 
-Hannah is copping it from Elle.
-Hello.

214
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,240 
Oh, fuck. She's here.

215
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,280 
-She's coming.
-She's coming.

216
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,600 
Hi.

217
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,360 
<i>I hope that the art therapy</i>
<i>gets us all back together as friends,</i>

218
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,120 
but it's very awkward
having Hannah and Elle around each other

219
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,160 
<i>because they just go at each other.</i>

220
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,720 
Hi, hi, hi.

221
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,080 
We all look cute.

222
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,080 
-Yeah, everyone looks cute.
-I love your hair.

223
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,880 
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

224
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,600 
I needed to get in the vibe.

225
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,560 
-Let's do it.
-Yeah.

226
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,880 
Cai had no idea what was coming.

227
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,560 
Thank you for blocking me on Instagram.

228
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,600 
-You're welcome.
-Yeah, that's right.

229
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,080 
"Thanks for blocking me on Instagram."
And I'm like, "Hey, you're welcome."

230
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,520 
All right, well, we're all here
to do some paint therapy,

231
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,720 
so let's get to it.

232
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,760 
Basically, we're trying to
get how you're feeling.

233
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,080 
I want to see this tension on canvas.
And I want to understand why.

234
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,200 
-All right.
-Yeah?

235
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,440 
Okay.

236
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,440 
I am one of the most generous,

237
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,080 
loving, open-hearted people that I know.

238
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,880 
But at the same time,
if someone dishonors me,

239
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,600 
I certainly wouldn't want to be them.

240
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,920 
So, going around the circle…

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,440 
Elle, starting with you.
What color did you pick and why?

242
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,800 
I needed to get the black paint
because I'm feeling hurt,

243
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,200 
and I feel like the black paint
really emanates that emotion.

244
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,720 
Elle has a problem with me
because she knows

245
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,480 
that I can see through
her light and love bullshit.

246
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,320 
Why are you feeling hurt?

247
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,840 
I'm feeling hurt because I just feel
like friendships have broken down

248
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,800 
all because of something
that was very miniscule.

249
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,720 
Who are you referring to
when you say that?

250
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,040 
Hannah.

251
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,000 
You told Sarah

252
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,720 
that I had some sort of
romantic connection

253
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,800 
with Nathan in the past
and that we are still together.

254
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,440 
But he brought that up
with me about you guys.

255
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,160 
What? That we kissed?

256
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,640 
You are two-faced.

257
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,760 
I'm not two-faced!

258
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,240 
-You are.
-You are!

259
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320 
You are.

260
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,720 
And I just don't want to
associate myself with that anymore.

261
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,760 
I'm happy for us to not be friends,

262
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,040 
-but I will be civil.
-I'm so happy for us not to be friends.

263
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,800 
I'm not someone to be fucked with.

264
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,080 
Whatever. I'm just over it.

265
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,080 
<i>It just seems like this battle</i>
<i>going up and up.</i>

266
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,520 
We wanted to clear the air,

267
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,640 
but it's just made things
a whole lot worse.

268
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,000 
<i>Hannah's news broke my heart</i>

269
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,720 
because I felt like I finally met
a guy who I could trust.

270
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,720 
<i>But I'm really starting to doubt myself</i>
<i>and my judgment of people.</i>

271
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,840 
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Hey. How are you?

272
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,040 
<i>Yeah, good. You look very nice today.</i>

273
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,160 
Thank you.

274
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,920 
I'm going out to a party later.

275
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,000 
<i>I called Mom to get some advice</i>

276
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,360 
to make sure that I'm not
jumping to conclusions

277
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,400 
or making a rash decision.

278
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,320 
So, you know how I told you
I was going out with Nathan?

279
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,680 
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-I keep hearing from so many people

280
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,360 
that Nathan's flatmate Elle and him
have something going on.

281
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,000 
I asked them both about it,
and he, like, flat-out denied it.

282
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,640 
So I can't trust Nathan.

283
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,640 
I just don't know what to do because
I really, really, really like Nathan.

284
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,200 
What he's done for me since I moved here,
and the way he's treated me,

285
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,480 
no one has ever done that for me before.
Like, ever. It's really hard.

286
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,840 
<i>I'm sorry that you're feeling</i>
<i>that way, lovely.</i>

287
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,120 
Yeah.

288
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,760 
Do you think I should just come home?

289
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,320 
<i>Well, I can't really tell you what to do</i>
<i>because it's how you feel. It's your life.</i>

290
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,800 
-Yeah.
<i>-But…</i>

291
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,920 
<i>I think you should perhaps</i>
<i>go with your gut feeling.</i>

292
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920 
If I leave, then it's, like, over.

293
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,640 
<i>Since I moved to Byron,</i>
<i>I've felt like an outsider.</i>

294
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,440 
<i>-I'll talk to you again soon.</i>
-Okay, love you.

295
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,560 
<i>-Okay, love you too. Bye-bye, love.</i>
-Bye.

296
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,480 
<i>-Bye.</i>
-Bye.

297
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,280 
<i>So, I just don't know</i>
<i>if it's worth staying here.</i>

298
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,920 
This is really hard.

299
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,880 
-How are you?
-Hey! How are you?

300
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,440 
Man, you've done a cracker job.

301
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,040 
Thanks, bro. How is it?

302
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,560 
-Looks sick, hey?
-It's amazing.

303
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,119 
Mate, we've been slogging it out.
Thank God you're here.

304
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,520 
Thank God I got the invite.

305
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,400 
-Reckon everyone's gonna love it?
-Yeah.

306
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,040 
Yeah, bro. I'm really excited for everyone
to get here, especially Sarah.

307
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,520 
<i>Today's about two things.</i>

308
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,240 
It's all about us all coming together,
having a good time,

309
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,320 
<i>and also for me to tell Sarah</i>
<i>how much she means to me.</i>

310
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,320 
-Looks like you put some time into this.
-Yeah, bro.

311
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,480 
<i>After the conversation we had with Elle,</i>

312
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,080 
<i>I really need to make sure</i>
<i>that Sarah knows</i>

313
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,960 
I'm not going to do anything wrong by her.

314
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,320 
Everyone I've talked to
is so hyped on tonight.

315
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,320 
It's gonna be mad. Look at this place.

316
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,120 
-Dude, this is ridiculous.
-I know.

317
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,880 
He's done an amazing job.

318
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280 
<i>He's really put an effort into this party,</i>

319
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,960 
<i>so hopefully,</i>
<i>Sarah is going to stick around.</i>

320
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,960 
I'm so excited to test this
and test the dance floor a bit.

321
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,960 
We're on again, aren't we?
We're on again. We're on.

322
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,080 
Parties in Byron Bay,
they're definitely "anything kinda goes."

323
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,520 
-Cheers, guys.
-Thanks for coming.

324
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,600 
-How are you, brother?
-Good to see you.

325
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,040 
How are you?

326
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,600 
Hey, you.

327
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680 
<i>This party is so lit.</i>

328
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,720 
I am so glad that I moved to Byron.
I am so glad.

329
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,520 
This has been one of the best decisions
I've made in my life.

330
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,600 
<i>Before, I came here</i>
<i>with over a million followers and fans</i>

331
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,000 
<i>who I love dearly,</i>

332
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,400 
but no real genuine friendships.

333
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,200 
<i>But now look at me.</i>

334
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,720 
Hello.

335
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,920 
-Hello.
-How are you?

336
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000 
Good, how are you?

337
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080 
-You look so fuckin' hot, Hannah.
-Do I?

338
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,080 
How was Cai's?

339
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,320 
-Oh, my God.
-That was so funny.

340
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,880 
It was actually so nice.
It was such a good day.

341
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,520 
But it got a bit hectic.

342
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,520 
-I wonder how Elle's feeling about it all.
-I was wondering about that.

343
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,320 
How do you feel?

344
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840 
I want to be over it. I want us
to all be good again and to move on.

345
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,640 
That's the same how I feel.
I don't want to be doing this anymore.

346
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,160 
I reckon, when she comes in,

347
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,600 
let's have a chat with her
and just say hello.

348
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,320 
We don't want to fight with her.

349
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,640 
-Yeah.
-And so…

350
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,840 
Her and Hannah can figure their stuff out.

351
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,200 
Hannah was dropping these bombs

352
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,560 
about how supposedly Elle tried
to hook up with Nathan recently.

353
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,320 
And I feel like Stav has no idea,
so I sort of just feel bad for him.

354
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,160 
-Is Stav gonna be here tonight?
-I don't know if Stav's coming today.

355
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,320 
<i>I feel really great</i>
<i>about entering Nathan's event.</i>

356
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,000 
<i>I'm just there to have</i>
<i>a great time with Stav.</i>

357
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,000 
So it's really important to just let go
of all the rumors about Nathan and I.

358
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,840 
<i>I love Stav.</i>
<i>He is an incredible human being.</i>

359
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,680 
Hello.

360
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,480 
-How are you?
-Good.

361
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,920 
-Hello.
-How are you?

362
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,840 
Lovely to see you.

363
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,960 
It's awkward.

364
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,120 
Thanks for coming.

365
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,160 
Here we are. Get into it.

366
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,480 
-This is it.
-Get away. Get away.

367
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,120 
-Hi.
-Hello.

368
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,000 
-How are we?
-Hello.

369
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,640 
-How's it going?
-You guys look beautiful.

370
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,040 
-So do you!
-You smell good!

371
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,360 
You know,
I want to move forward with it all.

372
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,600 
She's a good friend of ours.

373
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,640 
That is the cutest dress.

374
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,400 
-How are you?
-I'm good.

375
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,120 
Yeah. I'm really good.

376
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,160 
-You feeling okay after yesterday?
-Yeah, I actually am.

377
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,280 
You know what? I don't wanna
keep going on about this.

378
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,280 
-We are all friends.
-Yeah.

379
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,040 
And I do love you,

380
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,960 
but I don't want to be told
that I'm ganging up on you.

381
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,160 
Yeah, that's fair.

382
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,520 
I guess it was more so just me speaking
about how I felt at that time.

383
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,960 
I'm glad that everything is cool with us,
but I don't have an interest in building

384
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,720 
or maintaining a relationship
with Hannah right now.

385
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,920 
It is going to be very difficult for me
to ever form a new friendship with Hannah

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,920 
based off the amount of lies,
deceit, betrayal

387
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,120 
and two-faced behaviors
that I have experienced with her.

388
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,280 
We'll all be good moving forward, okay?

389
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,560 
We'll all be good,
and you and Hannah will work out.

390
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,200 
-Yeah, you guys sort it out.
-In time.

391
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,120 
I'm actually a big cuddly teddy bear
that is so affectionate

392
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,960 
and wants to give everyone love
and spread my light everywhere.

393
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,280 
But on the other hand,
you don't really want to fuck with me.

394
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,480 
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

395
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,760 
-Is Sarah here?
-No, she isn't.

396
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,440 
-I caught up with Sarah.
-Did you?

397
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,560 
-She was at my house.
-How did that go?

398
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,600 
I basically just apologized
for everything.

399
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,160 
-That's nice.
-I said I just wanna move forward

400
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,160 
in building a friendship
because she's with Nathan now.

401
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,960 
It's gonna be awkward
if we don't get along

402
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,480 
-and I wake up and she's in my kitchen.
-Yeah.

403
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,840 
I was wondering how…
Yeah, no, that's good.

404
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,840 
At the end of the day,
I just want Nathan to be happy.

405
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,880 
<i>He deserves to be happy.</i>

406
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,440 
It's still something
that I don't quite understand.

407
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,240 
You and Nathan are in a good place?

408
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,680 
-Yeah, we are.
-Good.

409
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,520 
-That's good.
-And you and Stav are in a good place?

410
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,560 
-Yeah, we're really good.
-That's good.

411
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,320 
Being in love with Stav is like feeling
the morning sun on your face

412
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,960 
and breathing in fresh air
every single day.

413
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,680 
And it's been so great.

414
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,680 
-We're in a really, sort of like…
-Yeah.

415
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,720 
Good. I'm glad.

416
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,640 
In all seriousness, with Sarah…

417
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,920 
Like, obviously there's feelings there.

418
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,360 
-I can tell.
-It's real, mate.

419
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,600 
Like, that's the thing, we've…

420
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,960 
Yeah, we've come a long way.

421
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,160 
I've put myself out there,

422
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,960 
and I'm at a point where
I've gotta throw it all on the line now,

423
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,560 
because if she decides
that she needs to leave,

424
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,960 
I need to know
that I've done everything I possibly can.

425
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,320 
I think I've done enough.

426
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,240 
Fuck, you've done even more
than I've ever seen you. That's love.

427
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,920 
I love it! He's opened up!

428
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,360 
-He's coming through.
-Thanks, bud.

429
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,280 
Good to see you.

430
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,640 
Thanks for coming, bro.
It'll be a good one.

431
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,680 
<i>I honestly cannot wait</i>
<i>for Sarah to get here.</i>

432
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,520 
I just wish she would hurry up because,
you know, she's running pretty late.

433
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,960 
<i>Hi, it's Sarah. Leave a message.</i>

434
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,800 
Hey, lovely. How are you?

435
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,800 
Just wondering when you're coming.
Everyone's here.

436
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,320 
So, I hope to see you soon.
Give us a call.

437
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,320 
Coming to this town,
I had the biggest hopes and dreams,

438
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,160 
<i>and I really hoped</i>
<i>that this was going to work.</i>

439
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,880 
I just feel like this town has broken me.

440
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,720 
That's not a party face. What's happened?

441
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,960 
Don't cry.

442
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,720 
-Sorry.
-Don't cry.

443
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,760 
Apart from you there's not a soul
in this town that I can trust.

444
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,840 
Is it Nathan?

445
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,200 
When I'm with him, it's like, amazing.

446
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,320 
But then I just feel like…

447
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,160 
Something is just happening under my nose
that he won't acknowledge,

448
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,600 
but everybody else seems to be
talking about it.

449
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,360 
Like, there's just so much stuff
that people are saying

450
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,760 
that's happening between Nathan and Elle,

451
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,560 
and I just don't want to be
caught in the middle of it.

452
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,280 
As in, the two of them are a thing?

453
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,400 
I like Nathan so much.

454
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,920 
But… sometimes feelings for someone
is just not enough.

455
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,600 
I just can't, like, compete with…

456
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,640 
a flatmate that has feelings for him
and the hostility, everything.

457
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,480 
It's just… It's all too much.

458
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560 
I can't trust anyone in this town.

459
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,920 
It honestly feels so crap to be
in the middle of all these hidden agendas.

460
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,800 
Does Nathan know?

461
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,800 
I feel like if I stay…

462
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,240 
there's always going to be that…

463
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,000 
little thing of doubt
in the back of my mind.

464
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,880 
And I don't want to be wondering
what he's doing or anything.

465
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,480 
-I just can't do it.
-Yeah.

466
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,240 
I feel like I've given this town
everything I've got,

467
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,840 
and I've tried so hard to make it work.

468
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,680 
I don't want you to go.

469
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,120 
You're the only friend
I've made in this town.

470
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,120 
It's like I'm gonna lose my only friend.

471
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,520 
-Not that I want to guilt you.
-I'm so sorry.

472
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,960 
You've gotta…
This has got to work for you.

473
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,800 
And if it's not enough for you
to stay here for him, I get that.

474
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,920 
I don't wanna leave

475
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,800 
and I'm gonna miss you
and I feel so bad, but…

476
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,320 
-I love you so much, babe.
-Me too.

477
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400 
I really want you to be happy.

478
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,560 
And I want you to just, you know,
do everything you wanted to do.

479
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,640 
<i>I feel like I'm in a tug-of-war</i>
<i>with my head and my heart.</i>

480
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,080 
This is not something
that I'm taking lightly.

481
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,960 
Thank you. I fucking love you so much.

482
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,000 
-I do too.
-I'm so grateful for you, honestly.

483
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,040 
Because when I make my mind up,
it's final.

484
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,040 
So if I leave…

485
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,840 
it's over between Nathan and I.

486
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,880 
<i>Hi! It's Sarah, leave a message.</i>

487
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,240 
-Caiser.
-You good?

488
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,360 
Where's Sarah, mate?

489
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,040 
I kept an eye on you before.

490
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,360 
So, did you try calling her just before?

491
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,920 
I'm literally…
I've been calling her all night.

492
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,880 
Everything's starting to become
pretty real now.

493
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,560 
I've heard nothing from Sarah,

494
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,720 
and, you know,
I'm spinning out of my own head

495
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,480 
as to what's happened to her,
where is she,

496
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560 
and why she hasn't contacted me.

497
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,240 
And it's actually, you know,
everything's starting to cave in.

498
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,440 
I'm really struggling.

499
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,000 
I've sent her a text. Nothing.

500
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,960 
It's really shit to see Nathan like this,

501
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,440 
because he's been working hard
on a lot of different things,

502
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,240 
and I think, in his eyes, he sort of saw
everything coming together tonight.

503
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,480 
And it's just not really working that way.
Sarah's not here and it's rattling him.

504
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,840 
Don't jump to conclusions.
Maybe she's still on her way.

505
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,600 
It's a good night.
All these people are here for you.

506
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,400 
I know, bro. I know. I get that.

507
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,640 
I get that, but she's not here, bro.

508
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,920 
The one person…
Obviously, I love having you guys here,

509
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,720 
but, like, I was expecting her
to be here by my side the whole time.

510
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,680 
I genuinely don't know why she's not here.

511
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,760 
I'm starting to question
what's been going on.

512
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,160 
Hey, it's okay.

513
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,840 
-Spirits up. Come on, bro. It's okay.
-I love you, bro.

514
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,240 
<i>Nathan's my homey. I'll always</i>
<i>be there for him if he needs me.</i>

515
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,920 
-Big teddy bear.
-Thanks, bro.

516
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,520 
Do not do that. Do not…

517
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,920 
Stav and I have
a lot of challenging mechanics

518
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,160 
in our relationship
that need to be worked through.

519
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,920 
Long-distance relationships
can definitely be tough.

520
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,320 
-Well, you look beautiful tonight.
-Thank you.

521
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,880 
-It's so nice that you're here.
-Yeah.

522
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,600 
I know that we've had, like,
a lot of challenges.

523
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:12,320 
Obviously, you know, me living in my house
with Nathan, and you not being there.

524
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,760 
He's been a great friend.

525
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,400 
I'm glad you guys have been
through this together.

526
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,840 
-I'm glad I'm here now.
-Yeah.

527
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,240 
I love you so much.

528
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,880 
You're so cute.

529
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,600 
-Elle…
-Yeah.

530
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,000 
-I love you so much.
-Yeah.

531
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,560 
And there's so many opportunities
that we have in our future together.

532
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,480 
I know.

533
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,800 
And I cannot express my love
for you anymore

534
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,120 
than I can do right now.

535
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,440 
Elle, will you marry me?

536
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,040 
Are you cheeking around?

537
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,000 
They got engaged.

538
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,280 
-What?
-They got engaged.

539
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,320 
This engagement has come out of the blue,
and I don't know if we're ready for it.

540
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,640 
But we're on a mission to save the world,

541
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,040 
and what better way to do that
together with someone that you love?

542
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,320 
Thank you, everybody.

543
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,360 
I have asked this woman to be my wife.

544
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,360 
And what did you say?

545
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,360 
Yes.

546
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,640 
Thank you.

547
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,560 
Stav!

548
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,760 
-So amazing.
-Surprise, surprise.

549
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,480 
I'm so happy for them.

550
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,400 
-They make a lot of sense.
-No you're not.

551
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,640 
You're not. You're definitely not.

552
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,600 
Stav, man.

553
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,080 
Come on.
What kind of spell has she got you under?

554
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,040 
-Breathe in, breathe out.
-I know that.

555
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,560 
Terrific.

556
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,640 
I cannot deal with that right now.

557
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,120 
Personally, I wouldn't want to get engaged
where, like…

558
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,280 
the guy who I've been hooking up with
is also there, but…

559
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,320 
love is mysterious.

560
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,720 
Congratulations.
You fucking cute people.

561
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,200 
You're beautiful. You guys are the best.

562
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,600 
That's probably one of my biggest fears
is dropping to the knee. It's huge.

563
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,960 
Based on things
that have happened in the past

564
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,080 
and things that Elle's said to me,

565
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,120 
<i>I don't know how long it's gonna last.</i>

566
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,600 
Good job. You've done well.

567
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,360 
Nathan looked really shocked
by the engagement.

568
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,280 
There's been a lot on my mind,
but that was the smartest thing I've done.

569
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,080 
-Nice.
-Thank you.

570
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,600 
Yeah, baby.

571
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,960 
Nathan loves me, and I can only imagine

572
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,080 
that it's a little bit difficult
for Nathan to not be

573
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,920 
my number one go-to anymore.

574
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,560 
<i>But he's with Sarah.</i>

575
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160 
Good.

576
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,600 
But where is Sarah? Where is she?

577
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,120 
I'm walking into Nathan's party
without my wingman, and it sucks.

578
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,880 
Everyone is so rattled.

579
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,840 
Hey, Mr. Margarita.

580
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,960 
-Can I have a chat with you?
-Yeah, of course.

581
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040 
Thanks.

582
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,400 
I'm not sure
how Nathan will react to this.

583
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,240 
-You happy with how tonight's going?
-Mate, it's been going good.

584
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,040 
But I'm fucking… I'm rattled.

585
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,880 
Obviously, like, Sarah's not here.

586
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,000 
And I've called her a bunch of times.
I texted her.

587
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,120 
I had a very sad Sarah in my office
this afternoon.

588
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,280 
-Yeah?
-Bawling her eyes out.

589
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,200 
And… a packed car,

590
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,840 
and she's gone.

591
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,120 
She's just said she's had enough.
She can't do it anymore.

592
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,560 
I think all of Byron's just got to her.
And look, I get it.

593
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,200 
It's a small town,
and it is an insular environment here.

594
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,360 
Like, you run into everyone.
It's tough to break through that.

595
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,440 
You've been here long enough,
where it's not a thing for you.

596
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,800 
But I think for Sarah,
it was such a strong thing,

597
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,400 
she wasn't accepted by these girls.

598
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480 
And then the girls just turned on her.

599
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,960 
And then, there's this rumor about,
you know, Elle and you,

600
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,520 
and it's just compacted on her.

601
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,600 
And she doesn't know what to do,
and, like, she was devastated.

602
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,760 
She brought this up with me
and I quashed it straight away,

603
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,880 
and I told her there's nothing going on.

604
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,800 
And on top of that,

605
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,159 
I've done everything I possibly can
to show her how much I care about her.

606
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,960 
I'm really, really devastated
that Sarah's listened to whatever rumor,

607
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,480 
and she actually believes
that Elle and I have something.

608
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,440 
I really believe that she loves you.

609
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,080 
I think that scared her
that she didn't feel secure

610
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,679 
and she didn't feel
like she had a place here.

611
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,199 
I guess this town just isn't a fit
for everyone.

612
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,280 
It's still your party.

613
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,520 
-Yeah.
-Let's get on with it.

614
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,720 
Thanks for telling me.

615
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,880
{\an8}<i>The worst part about all of this is</i>
<i>I could really see a future with Sarah.</i>

616
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,800 
<i>And I've literally stopped at nothing</i>
<i>to show her how much I care for her.</i>

617
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,680
{\an8}<i>And now she's gone.</i>

618
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,360 
<i>Where did I go wrong?</i>

619
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,000 
<i>I feel like I've tried everything.</i>

620
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,240 
But this town just doesn't seem
to want to accept me.

621
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800 
I feel like I've had my heart broken.

622
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,080 
<i>It's so upsetting.</i>
<i>I just wish she was here.</i>

623
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,520 
<i>And it fucking hurts.</i>

624
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,480 
<i>Look, 90% of the time,</i>

625
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,200 
<i>we're posting the good times,</i>
<i>but it's not always that way.</i>

626
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,960 
<i>Nothing is perfect.</i>

627
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,880 
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>
<i>all any of us want</i>

628
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,040 
<i>is just to connect with somebody.</i>
