1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,680 
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,720 
-How cute are these?
-Very cute.

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,120 
So who did you invite?

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,920 
-Well, I invited Hannah.
-Yeah.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920 
-And then, of course, Jade.
-Yeah.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,280 
It can't be a girls' lunch without Jade.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,800 
-Gotta call Jade.
-If he didn't come, he'd kill me too.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,720 
And then…

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,120 
Elle.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,400 
Elle. Okay, so Elle is coming.

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,800 
I promised Saskia

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,080 
I wouldn't tell anyone the secret
she told me about Elle and Nathan.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,400 
Nathan told me

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,720 
that Elle and him
have hooked up in the past.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,800 
Yeah.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,840 
But it's a hard secret to keep
when Jade's your best friend.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,360 
-Hi.
-Oh, my gosh.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,519 
-Hello.
-Hello.

19
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,240 
-Hi!
-Hello.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,360 
-Hi!
-Hi!

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,160 
Oh, my gosh, don't you look so beautiful!

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,640 
-Come give me a hug.
-I miss you!

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,640 
-How are you?
-Nice to see you.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,040 
Come on, sit down.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,800 
I love you in a print.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,440 
-I love it on you.
-Love, love, love.

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,840 
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,360 
-Isn't this so cute?
-Yes.

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,360 
Gorgeous.

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,240 
I was like,
"We need a beautiful lunch, the girls."

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,320 
-Yeah.
-And I'm here, fucking living for it.

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240 
I love it.

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,080 
-The girls are here, baby.
-I knew you'd love it.

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,440 
I think there'll be
a big elephant in the room.

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,080 
-Who's coming?
-Elle's coming.

36
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,040 
No.

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,520 
So, I organized this lunch
to bring all the girls together.

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,680 
My real motive behind it
is to get everyone to talk. Let it out.

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,360 
Be honest.
Get it out there and let's move on.

40
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,640 
I wanted to be friends
with everyone again.

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,880 
I know that there's been situations
and I do think we need to talk about it.

42
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,120 
Everyone is against Elle.

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,880 
And Elle is just constantly lying
and making us all look like idiots.

44
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,919 
I mean, Elle called Sarah fake.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,240 
Honestly, there's something fake there.

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,440 
And that is not resonant
with, you know, my friend group.

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,960 
But Elle denying what she said

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,680 
makes Jess and I look like liars
and makes Elle look like a saint.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,360 
I mean, everyone
has said something about Sarah.

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440 
Just own what you've said.

51
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,280 
We all said
that we thought she was a bit fake.

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,000 
-She's a bit standoffish.
-Yeah.

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,880 
-You know, let's not lie.
-Exactly!

54
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,640 
And we've all owned up to what we've said.

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,240 
-Yeah.
-But Elle is saying she didn't say it.

56
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,240 
I don't get it. Look, I just wanted
to bring her in because I think

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,520 
if we're going to chat, let's all chat.

58
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,880 
We're meant to be friends.

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,720 
She would have to be
out of her fucking mind

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,640 
to rock up to this lunch today

61
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,960 
and look at you and I and Hannah
and say that she didn't say it.

62
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,840 
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

63
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,040 
-How are you?
-How are you?

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,320 
Good.

65
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,520 
Are we sitting here and saying grace?

66
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,920 
I'll be honest.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,720 
I think we all need to talk.

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,600 
It started up with me.

69
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,080 
Everybody here knows
that I've befriended Sarah.

70
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,360 
We were talking about everything, and I…

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,040 
She was basically just asking me,
"What's going on?"

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,920 
Like, "Do the girls not like me?"

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,040 
And I said that you said
that she was fake.

74
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,120 
Hannah's thrown me under the bus.
Friends do not treat friends like that.

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,640 
I think a good thing today
is for us to all own our part.

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,520 
Let's just own our part.

77
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200 
I think she just needs to own it

78
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,760 
to end the drama
between everyone in the group.

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,040 
I just want everyone to move on
so we can all get along

80
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,680 
and have a good time together.

81
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,920 
You know, you probably all brought me here

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,120 
because you're wanting me to admit
that I called Sarah fake.

83
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,880 
I know I've told Sarah to her face,
"I don't feel like you're authentic."

84
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,480 
All this time you've said
you didn't say it at all.

85
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,400 
I said that I said
that she's not acting her authentic self.

86
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,880 
-Which is--
-No, that's--

87
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,880 
Let me finish.

88
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,120 
One, I don't even use that word, "fake."
Two, I haven't called her fake.

89
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,240 
I am far more eloquent
to just use a lazy word like that.

90
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,920 
To be honest, it's a bigger picture.
I want to know why you're doing this.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,800 
-What am I doing exactly?
-Well, that you're denying it.

92
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,560 
I'm actually not denying anything.

93
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,920 
I said she's not
acting her authentic self,

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,960 
which is effectively saying
someone is fake.

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,480 
-Can I ask a question?
-Can I please finish?

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,040 
-And--
-Elle, I get that you want to finish.

97
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,200 
You keep saying that to Hannah.
"Can I finish?"

98
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,800 
And I think you have anger towards Hannah.

99
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,560 
I would really like to just finish
so I can actually answer your question.

100
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,200 
She hates my guts.

101
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,800 
Right now, in this moment,
I have the biggest problem with Hannah

102
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,840 
because I feel like
she's completely two-faced.

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,760 
I actually don't have time or space
or energy for any of this nonsense.

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,360 
After hearing about
Elle and Nathan hooking up,

105
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,560 
I think that there's a few layers
of why Elle is denying this.

106
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,280 
I think, one, it's because she doesn't
want to get on Nathan's bad side.

107
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,760 
Nathan's now seeing Sarah.
She said a negative thing about Sarah.

108
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,320 
So she is prepared to deny it
to every single person in her path

109
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,280 
to make her look good, like she's an angel
and everyone else is against her.

110
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,600 
I feel like you said it
and then you regretted it.

111
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,240 
-I feel like there's other levels…
-No, actually…

112
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,480 
…that's not talked about.

113
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,360 
There's other reasons
why you would want to deny it.

114
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,920 
There isn't anything going on.

115
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,440 
Elle's lying
about what she said about Sarah.

116
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,000 
You know what? Elle's lying
about the fact she's in love with Nathan.

117
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,360 
I understand all of your perspectives.
I really hope you can see mine.

118
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360 
I hope you have a beautiful afternoon.

119
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,640 
-No, Elle, you shouldn't be walking away.
-Elle!

120
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,120 
You should be taking responsibility
for what you said.

121
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,040 
Just leave it.

122
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,840 
God.

123
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,080 
Her energy is just so scary.

124
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,840 
And I think it's time for me
to stick up for myself.

125
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,720 
This is the campaign we pitched on.

126
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,200 
They chose the other company
'cause they were cheaper.

127
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,200 
-Hello.
-Hi!

128
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,000 
-Bookmark this. Let's slide it off later.
-Done.

129
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,680 
-Sorry.
-Hey, gorg.

130
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,640 
I'm in a tug-of-war
with my head and my heart.

131
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,240 
And I just need to tell somebody
who really cares about me how I'm feeling.

132
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,560 
Have a seat. Tell me what's been going on.

133
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,800 
The usual.

134
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,560 
-I've just been in the studio heaps.
-Yeah, right.

135
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,520 
-I got my lips done too.
-They look great. Show me.

136
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,880 
I got them done once. I tried
to tell people I had an allergic reaction.

137
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,280 
No one believed me.
I looked like a pufferfish.

138
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,480 
-But after a few days were you into it?
-Looked amazing.

139
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,720 
Day one, you're always like,
"What have I done?"

140
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,400 
-By day three you're like, "I need more."
-Yeah.

141
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,360 
When I hung out with him at the beach,

142
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,040 
it meant the absolute world to me
that Alex defended me to the girls.

143
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,200 
But in the back of my head,

144
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,200 
all of the gossip and rumors
are still there.

145
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,160 
So what's happening?
Were you having a shit time?

146
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,080 
I just felt a little bit weird,

147
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,400 
'cause nothing has been resolved
with the girls.

148
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,080 
It was kind of fine
but it was also awkward because…

149
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,920 
I was just really aware
that none of these girls are my friends.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840 
Yeah.

151
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,000 
Out of all of the girls,
I feel like Elle is probably the worst.

152
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,960 
Elle has said
a bunch of awful things about me

153
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,200 
and, at this point,
I just need her to cut the crap.

154
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,200 
And just admit it and we can move past it.

155
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,920 
How do you feel about it?

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,240 
You know, you came here to make friends

157
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320 
and to be honest…

158
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,480 
-Are you happy?
-No.

159
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,880 
I was so optimistic when I came here.

160
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,360 
I was so excited to connect with people.

161
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,400 
And day after day, week after week,
it's been the opposite.

162
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,280 
I don't want to quit,
but at the same time,

163
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,800 
it's bringing back a whole heap of stuff
from when I was little.

164
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,960 
I've never explained this to you before.

165
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,320 
We grew up where all of our school friends

166
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,840 
were blond hair, blue-eyed, pale Aussie.

167
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,600 
My mom's not from here,

168
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,760 
so we had a different accent and food
and culture and all that kind of stuff.

169
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,640 
And my sister and I
got bullied mercilessly for it.

170
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,600 
And every day,
we were just made to feel… Sorry.

171
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,640 
Every day we were made to feel like,

172
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200 
"Was something wrong with us?"

173
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,360 
And I feel like that every day here.
Like I'm not good enough.

174
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,680 
Yeah, it's just shit.

175
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,800 
-Sweetie, it's not worth it.
-Yeah.

176
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,800 
You're too pretty to cry, darling.

177
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,400 
I've been thinking a lot
about just moving back to the Gold Coast.

178
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,720 
Sweetie.

179
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,760 
I could just pack up

180
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,760 
and head home back to my friends
and back where I feel like I belong.

181
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,520 
But the thing that's keeping me here
is Nathan.

182
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,800 
We have a connection
that I just can't give up on right now.

183
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,480 
Does Nathan know
how this is affecting you?

184
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,520 
He gets it, but I don't want to,
every time I'm with him,

185
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,320 
-talk about negative stuff.
-Yeah.

186
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,320 
I feel like I'll give it one more go
to try to just resolve everything,

187
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,600 
and then, if not…

188
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,480 
Back to the Gold Coast.

189
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,880 
I'm gonna have a go at him
because Sarah's my friend.

190
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,280 
And if Nathan doesn't stand up for her,
she's gonna leave.

191
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,080 
-Nath!
-Hey!

192
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,520 
Mate, the front door's open,
so I let myself in.

193
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,360 
-Mate, come in. How's things?
-Yeah, good.

194
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,800 
-Good to see you.
-Yeah, likewise.

195
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,240 
Sarah's in the middle of her own cyclone.
She's got a new boyfriend.

196
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,320 
She's got the jealous housemate
of the new boyfriend.

197
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,360 
It's great if she's Taylor Swift
writing a new album,

198
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,880 
but this is no way to live.

199
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,520 
And unless Nathan stands up
and does something, she's gonna leave.

200
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,240 
I got weird vibes from Sarah yesterday.

201
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,640 
-Really?
-She just…

202
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,880 
I think this whole
Byron thing's getting to her.

203
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,480 
Mate, I could… To be honest,

204
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,560 
she's definitely had a rough go,
moving down to Byron.

205
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,440 
Not everyone's been
the most welcoming, you know?

206
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,760 
The one that I am a little weirded out by
that's coming for Sarah,

207
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,520 
which I don't really get, is Elle.

208
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,760 
I'm Elle's friend
and I'm trying to mediate here.

209
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,560 
I'm trying to look out for Sarah,

210
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,520 
but also, you know,
keep my friendship with Elle.

211
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,800 
And how's that going for you?
Because I feel you're in a tough spot.

212
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,400 
It's not going great.

213
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,320 
Why would she just blanket
not want to give her a chance?

214
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,560 
She's quite protective over me.

215
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,360 
So if she gets
any sort of vibe from anyone

216
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,400 
that they're not going to be nice,
then she's just like, "Nah."

217
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,920 
Cut the shit.

218
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,160 
Is Elle in love with you?

219
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,160 
Because it doesn't make any sense to me.
Why does she care so much?

220
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,960 
I get being a protective friend,
but it sounds like she's jealous of Sarah.

221
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,240 
There's been some things said in the past

222
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880 
where she's like,
"We're really, really close."

223
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,080 
Was she wearing a negligee at the time?

224
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,720 
And she can't imagine life
without me and stuff.

225
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,680 
There's definitely been comments
thrown around that I'm like,

226
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,840 
"Yeah, it could allude to that for sure."

227
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,920 
-Is that uncomfortable for you?
-A little bit, because she has a partner.

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,640 
Which, you know, I'm friends with.
And Stav's here a lot.

229
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,480 
And I would rather
just be friends with Elle.

230
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,600 
Look, I'm no rocket scientist,
but Stav actually is.

231
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,320 
So if he hasn't picked up
what I've picked up,

232
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,080 
and the vibes that Elle's given me, then
maybe I should start working for NASA.

233
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,320 
You've got to make a decision,
because if you really want

234
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,520 
to have a future with Sarah and you want
to explore what a relationship's like,

235
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,480 
it's never gonna happen
when Elle is staring over your shoulder,

236
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,640 
judging you, guilting you.

237
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,600 
-Fucking man up and do something.
-Yeah.

238
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,440 
You can't live life with both.
You've got to make a decision on one.

239
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,680 
If she doesn't get accepted
by these girls,

240
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,400 
Sarah's, you know,
hopping on the Pacific Highway.

241
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,320 
She's going home.
It's not worth it for her.

242
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,680 
I really don't want Sarah to leave.

243
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,040 
I need to show Sarah
how much I care for her

244
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,720 
because, as scary as it is,
I'm actually starting to fall for her.

245
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,680 
Are you alive, Jade? This is the most
quiet I've ever heard you.

246
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,840 
I'm so relaxed. This is so good.

247
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,200 
I feel like one of the best things in life
that I've done so far

248
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280 
is definitely moved out here to Byron.

249
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,840 
The people that I've met so far
and the experiences that I've had,

250
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,840 
and the energy
is just a total vibe and a half.

251
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,920 
-That is just what I needed, right?
-Same.

252
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,720 
-That was amazing.
-So nice.

253
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,400 
I've been working so hard lately
and it's so weird

254
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,440 
because I come here with you today
for a relaxing massage,

255
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,920 
and just before
I walk out the door to leave,

256
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,880 
you will never believe what arrived.

257
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,560 
You've got the product here?

258
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,960 
-I have the official packaging.
-Oh, my God. Show me.

259
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,840 
So even though I do have
a wild, crazy, fun party side,

260
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,560 
I am also quite a serious businessman,

261
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,320 
and I'm just about
to launch my own product.

262
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,520 
-Are you ready?
-I am.

263
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,080
{\an8}I am so excited. Have a go.

264
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,360
{\an8}-Oh, my gosh. I love it.
-Yeah. You love it?

265
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,840 
I have been wanting to do
my own fake tan for so long,

266
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,520 
but now my dreams are coming true.

267
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,680 
How long have you been working on this?

268
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,400 
Eight and a half months? Nine months?

269
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,880 
-Wow.
-Yeah.

270
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,080 
So how are you going to launch it?
What's the goss with that?

271
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,400 
I'm so excited.
I put everything that I have into this.

272
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,520 
This fake tan launch
is the biggest day of my life.

273
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,720 
Literally. This day's so important to me
and it's so important that it goes right.

274
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,440 
-We're going to go to the GC.
-My favorite place.

275
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,440 
Yes, and we're going to do it
on a massive yacht.

276
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,000 
This is the biggest yacht
in the whole of the Gold Coast,

277
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,200 
and the whole of Nelly, Queensland.

278
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,760 
Oh, my gosh. I'll get my tightest,
shortest dress and my highest heels

279
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840 
and I'll be ready.

280
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,360 
Get those boots on, baby. We're going GC.

281
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,680 
I am so excited.
This is going to be amazing.

282
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,600 
-Yes.
-So who's coming?

283
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,080 
-Everyone's coming?
-Everyone.

284
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,800 
So I'm guessing Elle will be there.

285
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,760 
Yeah. It's gonna be awkward though,
isn't it? Because…

286
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,520 
Yeah. Now she's actually
going after Hannah.

287
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,400 
Elle has serious drama
right now with Hannah.

288
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,520 
This tan launch is gonna be so awkward.

289
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,720 
It's so weird. And I'm like,
"What is actually happening," you know?

290
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,080 
-Strange.
-It is.

291
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,040 
There's so much drama going down

292
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,600 
and there's only one place
for this to be settled:

293
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,200 
at my tan launch.

294
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,480 
This is going to be great.

295
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,720 
This is so nice!

296
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,800 
I pulled out all the stops today

297
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,640 
because I want
to show Sarah that I'm worth staying for.

298
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,560 
Jump in.

299
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,480 
And ultimately tell her
how much she means to me.

300
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,920 
-Cheers.
-Thank you. Cheers.

301
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,920 
-Now you've seen the hinterlands.
-Yeah.

302
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,120 
-It's so nice.
-Yeah.

303
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,480 
It's really pretty.

304
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,960 
At this point, the only thing
keeping me here in Byron is Nathan.

305
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040 
Have you been into the hinterlands at all?

306
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,080 
-Never?
-No.

307
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,720 
This decision is so massive
because I haven't felt this way

308
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,800 
about a boy in such a long time.

309
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,600 
But when I make my mind up, it's final.

310
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,400 
So if I leave,

311
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,920 
it's over between Nathan and I.

312
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,200 
There's a lot going on. How are you
feeling about everything like that?

313
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,920 
I don't know.

314
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,040 
No one's made any effort
to get to know me, and…

315
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,280 
So no one knows the real me,

316
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,680 
because I feel like I just keep…

317
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,200 
Every time I hear someone saying stuff,

318
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,480 
like, negative things are coming out
of people's mouths about me,

319
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,720 
it just wears me down so much.

320
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,360 
I just don't know who I can trust.

321
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,400 
Right now, I don't even know
who Sarah should or shouldn't trust.

322
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840 
I trust all of these people, for me,

323
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920 
because they've never done
a wrong thing by me.

324
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,480 
But I think that I've proved time
and time again that Sarah can trust me.

325
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,600 
I've done nothing wrong by her
and I've always had her back.

326
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,760 
All of this stuff
is exactly why I was like,

327
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,360 
"I just need to get you
out of the Byron bubble."

328
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,920 
I don't know
if this will surprise you or not,

329
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,720 
but I don't always go out and do massive
spreads out in the hinterlands.

330
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,840 
It's like me saying, "Love Byron.
Stay here. This is amazing here."

331
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,760 
Yeah.

332
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,400 
You're, without a doubt, the best thing
that's happened to me since I moved here,

333
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,080 
and you've done stuff for me
that no one has ever done.

334
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,400 
So, yeah. I'm really grateful
and I'm really glad that I met you.

335
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,800 
You make me really happy. You really do.

336
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,400 
And you need to know
that I will always have your back.

337
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,600 
You can always trust me.
I'm never gonna break your trust.

338
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,080 
It's a big decision I have to make

339
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,000 
between going home
and being around my friends and my people

340
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,360 
and staying here and falling in love.

341
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,880 
But right in this moment,
I just want to stay here forever.

342
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,000 
This is everything
I've ever dreamed of in my life.

343
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080 
Have a look.

344
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,600 
Today is the biggest day
in my whole career and possibly life.

345
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,920 
The influencer industry
is very competitive.

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,080
{\an8}And now to have my own product
is just such a big deal.

347
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,200
{\an8}And if this failed,
I really don't know what I would do.

348
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,760 
I need everything to be so perfect
because everyone's gonna be doing socials.

349
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,880 
My backdrops are everything, yeah?

350
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,000 
Perfect.

351
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,000 
I just want this to go perfectly.

352
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,560 
I've literally come to Byron Bay
with zero friends.

353
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,000 
And this is not a very Byron event.
This is definitely a Gold Coast event.

354
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,320 
So I'm absolutely terrified,

355
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,440 
because there is quite a possibility
that people might not turn up today.

356
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,560 
Do you feel like
I need to do anything else?

357
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,080 
Everyone's gonna love it.

358
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,640 
-See, that's the charm of the Coast.
-Hello.

359
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,840 
-Let's go get a drink.
-Okay. I'm down for that.

360
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,600 
As soon as I step on the boat,
it's like cocktails,

361
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,160 
half-naked men…

362
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,080 
Jade's in heaven.

363
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,360 
I love you.

364
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,760 
I feel uncomfortable.

365
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,040 
I'm sure a few people are a bit violated,
but it is what it is.

366
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,880 
-Cheers. Thank you.
-Cheers!

367
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,640 
This is such a massive boat. So insane.

368
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,520 
-The shirtless guys…
-Shirtless guys. Can you get on that?

369
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,320 
Thank you for coming.

370
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,680 
Cruise onto the boat with Simba.

371
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,600 
The place looks pretty epic.
It reminds of something from Ibiza.

372
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,800 
It's definitely a very different
demographic to Byron Bay.

373
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,040 
But I love Jade.

374
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,520 
And obviously he's done well for himself,
so I'm all for it.

375
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,800 
-Cheers, lords!
-Cheers, lords!

376
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,560 
-Cheers with my claw.
-Yeah, we got it.

377
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,480 
I have a deep, loving affinity

378
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,480 
and appreciation
for entering Jade's world.

379
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,600 
Interesting people that can't really
move their face or their lips.

380
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,880 
It's just… It's Jade. I love it.

381
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,440 
Have you ever used fake tan?

382
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,880 
Give me 20 minutes.
I just pocketed one of Jade's.

383
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,920 
We've both used fake tan. Bodybuilding.

384
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,280 
We have!

385
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,320 
We've actually used fake tan.

386
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,280 
-We used to bodybuild.
-Bodybuilding shows.

387
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,520 
And you just go… Show us some moves.

388
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280 
Do "hold the fence."

389
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,960 
They glisten!

390
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,720 
I actually did this one on stage.

391
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,240 
I actually caught up with Nathan
the other day.

392
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,680 
He was saying that
him and Sarah were hanging out.

393
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,480 
I feel like it's important
that we have a chance

394
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,840 
to speak to Sarah today.

395
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,760 
Because Nathan does seem
like he has genuine,

396
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,280 
strong feelings for her.

397
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,080 
He actually likes her,
so why don't we make an effort with Sarah

398
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,480 
and have a chat to her?

399
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,880 
It makes me want
to get to know her a bit more.

400
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,600 
Hello.

401
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,560 
-Sorry, hello.
-Hey!

402
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,080 
-Hi.
-Well, hello.

403
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,440 
-Welcome to the Gold Coast!
-You're in the GC!

404
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120 
I'm so excited you girls are here!

405
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,440 
-I know. It's so exciting.
-Yeah.

406
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,720 
I think it's quite nice.

407
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,760 
We can finally say how we feel
and open up to her.

408
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,360 
I just think it'd be nice
to get to know you.

409
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,000 
You're obviously dating
one of my good friends, Nathan.

410
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,360 
He was like, "I'd love for Sarah
to make friends with my friends."

411
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,560 
I want to be able to offer that to you.
I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.

412
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,560 
Yeah, me too.

413
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,880 
I think you girls are beautiful.
I would love to get to know you

414
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,200 
and obviously Gold Coast boy.

415
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,120 
It feels like these girls are ready
to give me a bit more of a chance.

416
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,120 
You know when you pulled
Elle and I aside at Elle's fundraiser

417
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,960 
and I stood by Elle's side?

418
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,400 
I feel like a bad person

419
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,600 
because I didn't say the truth
to your face, when I should've.

420
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,520 
I stuck by Elle's side,
so I want to apologize about that

421
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,640 
because I'm really upset
about how Elle's gone about it now.

422
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,840 
-I mean, I--
-I appreciate you saying that.

423
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,200 
-I'm sorry.
-I, personally, when it comes to it…

424
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,200 
I have come in
and made friends with everybody.

425
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,560 
When I'd seen you, I could see
that you were alone, by yourself,

426
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,920 
which made me sad.

427
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000 
I was so confused as to
why you didn't come up and approach.

428
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,360 
Off the bat,
I wanted to be friends with everyone,

429
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,600 
but then when you hear that
people are saying stuff about you,

430
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,160 
it just means that I come to an event
and I'm more reserved and not myself,

431
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,880 
because I honestly don't know
where I stand with you.

432
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,880 
I have the utmost respect
for everyone here.

433
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,520 
I just need to get to know you.

434
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,200 
There's all this other shit
that's gotten in the way.

435
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,760 
Being on the Gold Coast has made me
realize I haven't been myself in Byron.

436
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,600 
But now I'm in my element,
where I feel most comfortable.

437
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,920 
I really want everyone to know the real me

438
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,440 
and I feel like, today,
I can show that to them.

439
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,920 
Getting to know you,
I'm sorry about speaking shit on you.

440
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,160 
-It's cool.
-I spoke harsh shit about you, sorry.

441
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,320 
And I've been so confused
about your relationship.

442
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,400 
-I've been a bit of a dick too.
-That's so fine.

443
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,200 
Let's… Who cares?
Let's all just be friends.

444
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,440 
Let's all take off our clothes
and Naked Tan. It's Jade Kevin Foster!

445
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,240 
It just feels so good,

446
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,160 
and it's incredibly reassuring to me

447
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,600 
because it's about time
people stopped blindly following Elle

448
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,080 
when they know
that she's done the wrong thing.

449
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,360 
Oh, my God, honey!

450
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,960 
Hannah always kisses everyone on the lips.

451
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,480 
-How weird was that lunch?
-A bit weird.

452
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,200 
-How weird was it?
-Really weird.

453
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,760 
-Very weird, right?
-Yeah.

454
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,120 
I am a little bit nervous

455
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,120 
to see Elle after that lunch.

456
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,680 
But I feel like it's time for me
to stick up for myself.

457
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,400 
Cheers, darling. Yes.

458
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,800 
Congrats.

459
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,360 
How's it going?

460
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,040 
Good, actually. Really good.

461
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,600 
I just had an interesting conversation
with Saskia, Jess and Jade.

462
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,920 
And we just got to…

463
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,680 
talk and iron everything out.

464
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,560 
Oh, my God! You resolved something.

465
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,600 
Jess and Saskia acknowledged
that they judged me

466
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,120 
and they had opinions on me.

467
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,160 
And they wanted to try to get to know me

468
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,840 
because things are a bit more serious
with Nathan and I than they thought.

469
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,080 
Saskia actually apologized to me,
which was really nice.

470
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,400 
-And how do you feel?
-So good.

471
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,120 
Today is going so well,

472
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,840 
and I can't wait to speak to Nathan
and tell him what's been going on.

473
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,240 
I just hope he's not with Elle.

474
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,800 
Where is Jade?

475
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,120 
-There she is. God damn.
-Is she coming over?

476
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,080 
No, she's not coming over, but I just…

477
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,080 
Hi.

478
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,880 
-Look, we can hide over here.
-I'm not hiding.

479
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,040 
-This is my home. This is my turf.
-True. She's on your turf.

480
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,160 
I just want… I can… I'm happy.

481
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,680 
I'm in my hometown.

482
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,560 
I just want to have a good day
and I'm not gonna let Elle drag me down.

483
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,200 
I moved to Byron Bay because
I knew that this would be something

484
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,160 
good for me to do for my career.

485
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,960 
And now I'm on this yacht
with my own product.

486
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,800 
This is a pretty cool moment
for me right now.

487
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,640 
Love it!

488
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,520 
Hello, sexy people.

489
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,160 
I'd just like to thank
all of the Naked Tan ambassadors

490
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,760 
and my new group of friends
that I have made in Byron Bay

491
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,400 
for being here today.

492
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,600 
I love each and every single one of you.

493
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,000 
Every time someone smells their body
after they put this on,

494
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,880 
I want them all to think of me, baby.

495
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,880 
Yeah, Jade!

496
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,320 
Today is such a massive success.

497
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,000 
I've made it. This, to me, is epic.

498
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,440 
I'm gonna say hi to the rest of the girls.

499
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,400 
-She's coming.
-Hello.

500
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480 
-Hello.
-Hi.

501
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,760 
-How are you?
-How are you?

502
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,960 
Elle walked all over Hannah
at the lunch yesterday.

503
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,560 
They might have something
out for each other. It feels like that.

504
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,880 
-How are you?
-How are you today?

505
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,200 
I actually think it's time
for me to confront Elle.

506
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,600 
And I'm here to back myself.

507
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,080 
What did I do to you?

508
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,440 
There seems to be a situation with us

509
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,080 
and you're not taking ownership
for everything you've said--

510
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,800 
I've taken ownership of everything.

511
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,720 
You pretend to be Sarah's friend,
you talk about her nicely,

512
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,760 
but you're calling me
saying, "I'm not vibing with Sarah."

513
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,880 
-I didn't say that, darling.
-Yeah, you did.

514
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,280 
Elle is very much wrapped up
within her own web of lies.

515
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,120 
And I know why.

516
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,600 
I actually have a little secret
about Elle and Nathan myself.

517
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,360 
I may or may not have said "fake,"
yet you all want to hammer me for it?

518
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,920 
Every time I even try to speak,
you just shut me down.

519
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,040 
It's not my problem

520
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,520 
that I have a big energy
and a strong presence.

521
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,480 
How about you level up
rather than try and pull me down?

522
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,280 
Elle, you seriously do not like me.

523
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,680 
-And that's okay.
-She can't handle confrontation.

524
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,600 
She wigged out.

525
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,040 
I can handle confrontation,

526
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,560 
but you totally don't like me
and that's okay,

527
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,680 
but don't try and be fake nice
to my friends as well.

528
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,000 
I'm not being fake nice.

529
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,040 
I think that's a massive projection
from you, my dear.

530
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,960 
I think you are very two-faced, Hannah.

531
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,040 
I know that Elle and I really aren't
each other's biggest fans at this moment

532
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,920 
and I've realized
I probably never was to begin with.

533
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,480 
The thing about Byron Bay is,
I've heard so many Elle stories,

534
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,120 
as in I am not fake
and I know people genuinely like me,

535
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,280 
and the amount of people that have told me

536
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,200 
or they have some sort of Elle story,
what does that say?

537
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,720 
I could say the exact same about you.

538
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,320 
-Really?
-Yeah.

539
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,040 
Really?

540
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,160 
You guys, this is getting so nasty.

541
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,120 
I don't fucking appreciate it.
I don't think it's good.

542
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,680 
Typical Elle move. She walks off.

543
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:54,800 
Elle is the quintessential
passive-aggressive spiritual human.

544
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,680 
Nath, I got to chat to you.

545
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,440 
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

546
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440 
Hey, what's up?

547
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,000 
Yo. Dude, I just had
the most hectic situation happen.

548
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,920 
-Here we go.
-With our fucking dear friend Hannah.

549
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,560 
I mean, I walked over
to say hi to the girls, really nicely.

550
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,080 
Hannah's like, "You know what, Elle?"

551
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,440 
"The amount of stories
that I've heard in Byron Bay about you."

552
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,600 
And how everyone has an Elle story.

553
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,400 
If someone's gonna come at me,
I will fucking show you

554
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,760 
how shitty it is
to not be in my good book.

555
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,240 
Hannah's behavior lately
has just demonstrated

556
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,440 
that she is not just crazy funny
like what I thought she was.

557
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,280 
She is proper crazy.

558
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,840 
Rich.

559
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,000 
I literally left for like two seconds
to show people my tan

560
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,760 
and what just happened?

561
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,840 
Elle walks away from every situation.
She does not take ownership for one thing.

562
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,880 
Elle storming off like that
doesn't surprise me.

563
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,800 
I mean, she believes her own lies,

564
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,000 
and she clearly is not coping okay
with Sarah and Nathan dating.

565
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,360 
I mean, I know that there's history
between her and Nathan.

566
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,880 
I feel like she's really
holding on to that.

567
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,680 
This is also why I don't think
Elle has taken to Sarah

568
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,320 
the way that she probably should have.

569
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,840 
Nathan told me, a little while ago,

570
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,920 
it was late at night
and Elle said to Nathan,

571
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,840 
"I want to kiss you.
Don't let me kiss you."

572
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,960 
And there was this--

573
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,960 
-What?
-Yes, even though she's with Stav.

574
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,760 
Is this recently that Elle said,
"I want to kiss you"?

575
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,600 
-Yeah.
-How did you find that out?

576
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,800 
Nathan told me.

577
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,720 
What?

578
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,640 
I knew Elle and Nathan had kissed,
but I didn't know they hooked up recently.

579
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,280 
I mean, the whole story
has completely just changed.

580
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,000 
People are so fucking dodgy,
I cannot handle it.

581
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,200 
I think Hannah's had enough of Elle's shit

582
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,360 
and she is dropping truth bombs
left, right and center.

583
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,280 
I'm just glad she has nothing on me.

584
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,200 
I think Elle rattled your cage
really badly,

585
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,560 
so now you're unleashing.

586
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,760 
Maybe I'm finally feeling
like I haven't said enough.

587
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,720 
I don't know, I just feel so good

588
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,600 
and I feel relieved that
the air's been cleared with the girls.

589
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,520 
Sarah's looking so relaxed.

590
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,760 
And she's looking beautiful.

591
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,800 
You can tell that she's in her element.

592
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,680 
I've literally been sitting and waiting
and hoping and wishing for that shift.

593
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,720 
But look at you.

594
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,440 
I'm so glad that you're feeling yourself

595
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,000 
and you're being the person
that I've seen in you.

596
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,600 
I feel like Nathan seeing me
in my element, on the Gold Coast,

597
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,520 
where I feel most comfortable,

598
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,240 
is good, because I want him
to know the real me.

599
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,920 
And I feel like I can show him
that side of me today.

600
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,280 
Let's go show this boat
and all of our friends

601
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,560 
who the real Sarah is.

602
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,840 
She's on. Here she comes.

603
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,520 
If I was in Sarah's position,

604
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,000 
I'd say I would want to know the truth
between Elle and Nathan.

605
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,480 
It's a vibe, right?

606
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,840 
I love this boat.

607
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,000 
Yeah, it's good to see you.

608
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,080 
-You too. I know. It's been a while.
-It's been so long.

609
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,600 
So did I hear
that you and Nathan are something?

610
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,040 
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

611
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,840 
I did say to Sarah
that I would be her backup bitch.

612
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,920 
And I will if she needs me.

613
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,520 
So you know how
when you came to my shop and I styled you

614
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,440 
and I said about what
we were talking about at Cai's?

615
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,000 
They were calling you fake.

616
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,480 
Elle was one of the main ones that said it
and she's denying and denying.

617
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,440 
Yeah.

618
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,000 
She met me, and she didn't like me,
and she said something.

619
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,480 
So it's not the issue
that she said something.

620
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,880 
The issue is she won't just say,
"I fucking don't like you."

621
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,800 
Yeah.

622
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,840 
And especially, the fact is,
you're with Nathan.

623
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,440 
-They're meant to be close friends, right?
-Yeah.

624
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,120 
-Meant to be close friends?
-Yeah.

625
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,159 
Are they not?

626
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,760 
Hannah's being
incredibly vague and cryptic,

627
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,760 
and I don't know why.

628
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,000 
Nathan told me that him and Elle
had a little something.

629
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,560 
Okay.

630
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,480 
And he said that it was late at night,
and even though she's with Stav…

631
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,679 
I was like,
"What? You're telling me this?"

632
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,040 
"This actually happened?"

633
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,040 
Okay, so Elle and Nathan
have a romantic history.

634
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,920 
Well, that's what Nathan told me.
That was all.

635
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,239 
But there's always something
a little bit more, so…

636
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,000 
If they actually had a thing,
she might have feelings for him.

637
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,600 
Then that makes so much more sense.

638
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,240 
And if Elle wants to be with Nathan

639
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,600 
and that's why
she's saying stuff about me,

640
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,000 
then that makes sense.

641
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,920 
Hannah has dropped this bomb on me.

642
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,240 
My head is all over the place
and I'm so confused.

643
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,440 
I'm starting to feel like a fool
for falling for him.

644
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,040 
I need to figure out
who's telling the truth

645
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,360 
and settle it once and for all.
