1
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,901
- Tom, where is she, huh?
- She must be in transit or a tunnel.

2
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:43,402
Or... Roman.

3
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:46,488
- Where's Shiv?
- "I don't know where she is, Dad."

4
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:49,909
What the fuck's going on?
What's everyone saying?

5
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:53,495
I need to know where everyone is
and what everyone's thinking.

6
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,997
"Where are you?"

7
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,291
You know, heading for a shit,
shave, and a shower.

8
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,335
"No. No. I need Connor steadied."

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,632
I need Marcia. I need Shiv.
I need Ray and Cyd and fucking...

10
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:09,553
I need you showing your face for me, son.

11
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,348
You want me to go talk to him, to Ken?

12
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,809
"No! Fuck that. No.
No one talks to the snake, no."

13
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:23,192
Keep Gerri close. Hmm?
Keep an eye on, huh? I trust you.

14
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:27,613
"It just had to be Gerri.
For right now. For today. "

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,951
Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah. I get it, Dad.

16
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,838
Okay, Greg.
Let's game a call with your Grandpa.

17
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:09,757
I'd like us to get Ewan squared off.

18
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:12,634
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think...
- Yeah?

19
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,930
I guess...
Maybe you ought to just do that, right?

20
00:03:21,643 --> 00:03:23,937
- You okay, dude?
- Yeah.

21
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,940
You wondering if you tied your dick
to a runaway train here?

22
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,693
What? No, no, no. I mean...

23
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:34,782
- You aren't Judasing are you, Greg?
- No. No.

24
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,994
Come here. Come on, buddy.
Come here. Let's huddle.

25
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:44,208
- What's up?
- Yeah.

26
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,169
- I don't know. I'm...
- Talk to me.

27
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,670
I...

28
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:55,594
I don't know.
I am, uh, just a bit scared.

29
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,388
Like, I don't...

30
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,182
You know, I don't really
wanna go to Congress again.

31
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,352
I'm kind of too young to be in Congress
so much, you know?

32
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:08,649
- Did my dad get to you?
- Tom keeps calling.

33
00:04:08,774 --> 00:04:11,860
He just wants to know where we
got the papers and... or you got...

34
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,362
- Look...
- And what's in the papers, and...

35
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:14,863
I'm not gonna burn you, kiddo.

36
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,033
I don't even have to tell the government
where I got the papers.

37
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:20,119
- Well, you said you wouldn't tell them.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:20,244 --> 00:04:21,620
- And... and I'll stick by that.
- Yeah.

39
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,122
- Hey, Ken.
- So, don't... Yeah.

40
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,623
- Remi's here.
- Hey. What up?

41
00:04:24,748 --> 00:04:26,125
- Remi in the house.
- What's up, bro?

42
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,168
Big things. Big things.

43
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,297
- You did the right thing, man.
- I want to do the right thing.

44
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,094
Okay. Let's settle your stomach.
Let's... let's set you up with a lawyer, okay?

45
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,054
- Hey. Ken?
- Okay.

46
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,556
- Ken?
- Yeah?

47
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:46,186
Oh, fuck yeah. Okay.

48
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,981
Can... can you figure this out?

49
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:53,152
Uh, hi, everyone. Sorry to interrupt. If...
We... we just need the room for a little bit.

50
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:56,405
- So, um... Take a five, take a ten...
- Thank you. Thank you, mental giants.

51
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:12,588
Can I... I'm gonna hop in that elevator
while it's still... Thank you.

52
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:14,882
Very nice.

53
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:33,233
- Hello?
- "Hello, Gregory."

54
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,862
Tom? Th... this...
this isn't the Tom number.

55
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,742
I know. Aren't I clever? Hey, Gregory,
is it true you have a saucy secret?

56
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:44,870
I... I actually don't know what
you're talking... Are you...

57
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:47,831
Do you like to do
your house chores in the nude?

58
00:05:48,457 --> 00:05:51,376
- "Hello? What?"
- What the fuck is going on, Greg?

59
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:55,589
I don't know, man. I'm just an observer.
I'm not a part of this necessarily.

60
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:59,343
"Well, Logan is very interested
what you're up to."

61
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:02,888
You don't come home to us,
you're gonna end up in a work camp.

62
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:07,351
Logan is going to fire a million poisonous
spiders down your dicky.

63
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:10,479
You better find an animal's corpse
to crawl into and hide.

64
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:14,691
I... I'm not a part of this, necessarily, Tom.

65
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:18,695
Okay. What about the papers?

66
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,241
I don't... I maybe don't even know
what they are or where they came from.

67
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,536
Fine. Okay.
Well, we'll have to see if he buys that.

68
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:28,914
Well... I... I mean, I can say...

69
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,416
Did you know that Shiv's over there?

70
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:35,003
- Wait. At Kendall's?
- "Yeah. Di... Did you know?"

71
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,673
Yeah. Obviously. But...

72
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:43,387
let's just keep that under the old Stetson
for now, okay, cowboy?

73
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:46,598
Yeah. Yes, sir. Yessiree.

74
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,517
- Any Shiv news?
- Um, what?

75
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:51,728
- Shiv.
- Shiv? Uh, no, no, no. Not as yet. Nothing.

76
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:53,397
No... no luck there.

77
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:55,899
- Okay.
- Okay?

78
00:06:56,024 --> 00:07:00,571
Yeah. Oh, and I called Stewy
and asked, and this came from him.

79
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:02,072
It's, um...

80
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,326
- Okay. Is that a joke?
- It's...

81
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:08,036
Who... who's the Trojan horse here?

82
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,538
You want... you want me
to look inside of it?

83
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:13,375
It's mind games. Send it back.
And set something, I need to see him.

84
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:19,214
- We good?
- Yeah. We're good.

85
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:26,305
There he is, the little man
who started this big war.

86
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:29,141
- How you doing?
- Can we get out of the sunlight please?

87
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,143
Who sold you the Thoroughbred?

88
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:35,897
"Safetime is backed by investment firm
Granite Holdings Incorporated"

89
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:39,985
"who stood by Safetime
throughout last year's technological issues."

90
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,321
- "Now at Safetime's..."
- Oh, my God.

91
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:46,033
- Look at you photograph your tiny name.
- Well, you know, for my daughters.

92
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,161
Oh, right. That is so cute.
How are your daughters? You got pictures?

93
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:52,831
- Don't talk about my daughters.
- Look at you, telling me the sensitive areas.

94
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:55,167
You know me, I'll be respectful.

95
00:07:57,294 --> 00:08:00,672
So this is it, huh? It's actually happening.

96
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:04,426
The odor prevails. The gas also rises.

97
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:07,846
Well, you know, it's like when you see
those lists of popes and emperors,

98
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:11,975
and some of them have asterisks
by their names.

99
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,188
So couple of things
I wanted to talk to you about.

100
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,109
I just wanna make sure...

101
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,074
Check that you're not concerned
about all of this stuff.

102
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:29,785
I have no idea what you're talking about.

103
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:33,705
I hope that you're not anxious
that you've, you know,

104
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:39,878
chained yourself to a fire hydrant that
spews out cultural insensitivity and sperms.

105
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,881
Look, Roman, I'm not kidding myself
about anything.

106
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:47,928
I need family support,
so I'm very open to cooperation and input.

107
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:50,347
- Right.
- And you have good instincts.

108
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:52,974
- Thank you.
- You also have horrible instincts,

109
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,435
like the... not cooperating is a disaster.

110
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,024
But you also have a good finger
on the pulse of, uh... in terms of...

111
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,819
You mean I sometimes surf the web?

112
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:08,824
Yeah. You know, news and culture, and whatnot.
You're... you have an instinctive...

113
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,826
Thank you. I have a thought.

114
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:16,498
I think you should put together an executive
committee to guide things in this interregnum.

115
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,459
Well, you know,
I don't wanna dilute my potency.

116
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:23,296
Yeah. But on the big calls,
you dip everyone's hands in blood.

117
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:26,383
But you and me, we run it to fuck.

118
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,595
See, I was thinking that first
we'd start with, you know,

119
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:34,307
working you into the quarterly earnings calls
as a signal.

120
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,936
- But, uh, you know...
- Likey-likey. That's a good start.

121
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:40,063
Let me think about
the executive committee thing. I mean...

122
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,565
- Yeah.
- ...it has good angles.

123
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:47,654
You know, like he's irreplaceable.
It takes six of us to replace one of him.

124
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:53,577
- Here we go. Your apprenticeship begins.
- Okay.

125
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:56,913
- Yeah.
- Okay.

126
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,542
So, Shivy, how we doing?

127
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,672
Look at you, all fucking merry.
Is Lisa here?

128
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,466
I have an offer.

129
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:11,845
- Yeah, that's not why I'm here.
- Well, I'm not gonna fuck around.

130
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:14,598
I want you to join me.

131
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:19,144
- I want you on my side.
- I'm not here to cozy up.

132
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:20,937
No.

133
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,029
But I would say, what dad did to you...
the sacrifice, that was cold.

134
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:33,158
Well, I don't know.
From his point of view, it made sense.

135
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,578
I mean, who else was he gonna choose?

136
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:41,333
Unless, you know,
he took responsibility himself.

137
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,003
- Well, yeah.
- So...

138
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,967
So? I get it. You were angry.

139
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:55,263
- That was a fucking snake move.
- Yeah. I... I know. I just, uh...

140
00:10:56,973 --> 00:11:02,020
Look, the situation was the situation.
I felt I had no choice.

141
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:04,564
Oh, come on, Ken.
That was self- aggrandizing bullshit.

142
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:06,733
It was a peacock fuck-show.

143
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:12,113
That's fair. I get it, sis.
You're angry with yourself.

144
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:16,701
- I'm sorry. What?
- You know I did the right thing

145
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,204
and you're angry with yourself
for never doing it.

146
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:20,789
- Come on. Fuck you.
- That's just...

147
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,582
what I would say is going on here.

148
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,294
- But if you don't see it that way...
- That is not it.

149
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,796
- Sure.
- You fucked the family.

150
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,590
- Or I saved the family?
- I think since this thing broke,

151
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:34,010
we've all been trying to navigate
our way through...

152
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:37,264
conflicting loyalties, and that's difficult.

153
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:43,895
You tell yourself you're a good person.
But you're not a good person.

154
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:50,819
Right now, I'm the real you.

155
00:11:53,154 --> 00:11:57,033
What? Sure. You're the real me.

156
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:00,203
And I'm the real you.

157
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:03,957
Yeah? What-fucking-ever.

158
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,647
- Where is she, huh?
- Yeah. Hold up. Let's see...

159
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:35,739
Have you spoken to Marcia?
Is someone connecting?

160
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:38,700
She's available, we hear.
You wanna reach out?

161
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:43,038
Yes, I wanna fucking reach out, Hugo.
I'm stuck in quicksand.

162
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,625
My family have disappeared.
The world is wobbling here.

163
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:50,295
Does no one understand
what the fuck is happening?

164
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:55,050
I'm losing juice.
I can't find the right fucking lawyer.

165
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,551
The sky is falling in.

166
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:01,431
So when I say something, it fucking happens.
We have to act on the world.

167
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:03,141
The fucking world. We have to act.

168
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:06,019
- Yes, sir.
- Get her up. Con, my brother.

169
00:13:06,144 --> 00:13:11,232
And get me some options,
some solid fucking options where we can fly.

170
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,612
I'm not gonna smuggle out of here
in a fucking packing case, okay?

171
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,491
- You got her?
- Still...

172
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:22,577
Connor.

173
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,957
- Con?
- "Hey. Hey."

174
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:28,708
- How you doing?
- "I'm great."

175
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,212
We flew back scheduled,
so that was just delightful.

176
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:35,632
- I'm sorry, son. That's tough.
- "It was fine."

177
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:39,219
They had movies and a selection
of heavily refrigerated cheeses,

178
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:40,720
so, you know, it was really nice.

179
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:45,934
You know, I just wanted to say, uh, hello
and, you know, thanks for holding the fort.

180
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,437
Sure. Operation: Thumb-Twiddle.
You bet.

181
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,107
And now that we got a moment,

182
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:57,529
those words, maybe harsh words
on that tin can on the boat, you know...

183
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:04,786
- Yes. So no harm done?
- You're pretty rude, Pop.

184
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:09,249
I... I'd just like to say,
it's good to know that...

185
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:14,379
with everything, I can rely on you,
with Kenny going nut-nut.

186
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:16,548
"Yeah. Sure. You know... Yeah."

187
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:21,136
Now, no one speaks to him, right?
You're number one, kiddo.

188
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,846
"You know that."

189
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:31,312
Number one.

190
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:37,235
So where are these famous papers?

191
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:40,613
Safe. Getting copied.

192
00:14:42,323 --> 00:14:45,493
You know, lose those, all this goes away.

193
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,872
Burn them. Go say sorry to dad. Beg for mercy.

194
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:53,376
Right. Say I had some deli sushi...
and everything went a little hazy.

195
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,628
- Shiv, come on.
- Great idea.

196
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:58,965
No. I'm doing this, and I want you on my side.

197
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,301
- So show me the papers.
- Well, I can't.

198
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:04,054
Unless you wanna come on board with me.

199
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:09,851
- But, you know, I gotta...
- Um, Kendall, you have a visitor?

200
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:19,652
- Roman's downstairs. Okay. Now we're talking.
- Shall I send him up?

201
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:22,447
- Well, does he know who's here?
- Uh, does he know she's here?

202
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:25,200
- I... I didn't mention it.
- You wanna let him up?

203
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,997
- Uh, I mean...
- You're the one I want, Shiv.

204
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,584
I want you.

205
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:39,089
- Sure. We should bring him in.
- Okay. Jess.

206
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,424
- Okay.
- Show him up.

207
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,010
Uh, Lisa needs two minutes.

208
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,854
Greg, this place is amazing.

209
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:59,275
Oh, thank you. Yeah.
It's, uh, not mine.

210
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:02,320
It's... Anyway, I'm very grateful.

211
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:07,575
So, uh, Kendall wants to pay for my lawyer.

212
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:12,539
And I just... Well, do you... You say.
What... what do you think, legally?

213
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:16,501
I haven't even finished first semester, Greg.

214
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:20,547
- I just need someone to talk to, Lia.
- Yeah.

215
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:25,135
Oh, God. Oh, man. What now?

216
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,056
- Hello?
- "Hi."

217
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,268
- "Uh, Oliver Noonan."
- Okay.

218
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,812
"Gerri Kellman said you agreed
I could come talk to you?"

219
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:39,274
Oh. Right. Um, sorry, who buzzed you in?

220
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,196
"Uh, we met at the hill hearings."

221
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:49,033
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey.
- Hey.

222
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,702
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

223
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:52,579
- Yes. I... Yeah, I remember.
- Yeah...

224
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:54,539
There were a lot of us, right? Yeah.

225
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:57,500
Like, I'm a lawyer from Arbuthnot Weiss,
and I'm just checking in to say hi.

226
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:01,129
- Oh, that's nice. Am I paying for this?
- No. My fees are paid by Waystar.

227
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,590
Should I come in and... and... and explain?

228
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:05,091
- I can...
- Uh, wait. Sorry. From... Sorry.

229
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:07,802
- From Waystar? So from Logan or...
- No. No.

230
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,096
I'm from Arbuthnot Weiss.
Greg, keep up man.

231
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,016
Hey, no, I'm just checking in to see
if the FBI has been in contact

232
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:17,520
- and see if you have any questions.
- Oh, um, okay.

233
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,481
- Because you're...
- I'm your lawyer...

234
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,192
- Okay.
- ...right? Yeah?

235
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:24,527
- Yeah.
- So I'll just... I'll call Gerri

236
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:26,487
and tell her that we're all squared away.

237
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:30,241
And if the government calls,
then she can tell them that I represent you.

238
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:32,368
Can... can you...
can you hold for one moment?

239
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:33,870
- Yeah.
- Okay.

240
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:35,663
- Yeah.
- Just... just hang... hang in. Hang tight.

241
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,584
- Yeah.
- And we'll, uh, we'll seal the deal.

242
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,590
So there is a lawyer here, Lia,
and... so he's saying he is my lawyer.

243
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,385
- Do you think he's probably my lawyer?
- Uh, well, I... I don't... I don't know.

244
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:54,390
He couldn't, like, sue me or not...
arrest me or subpoena me or...

245
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:57,101
I don't... I don't know...
I don't really know what any of it means.

246
00:17:57,227 --> 00:18:00,563
- You want me to text my professor?
- Yeah. Text... text him. Text him.

247
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,944
Yo. Yeah, man. I think it's good. I feel...

248
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:09,781
I feel, like, uh, just a couple quick,
quick questions

249
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:12,951
which is, do you choose me
or do I choose you?

250
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:17,830
- No, well, you choose, Greg.
- Let's let you go now, and... and...

251
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:22,877
and I'm gonna think. I just need to think
a little bit and just, uh, see you soon.

252
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,296
- Well, okay. Good.
- No, no, no, no. Not...

253
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:28,466
- Not that that constitutes a legal promise.
- All right.

254
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,551
- All right.
- Okay. All right. I'll call Gerri.

255
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,596
- I'll call Gerri first. Oh... Okay.
- Okay.

256
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:36,975
I know you have things going on

257
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,769
but I'm gonna need you
for like eight to ten hours very soon.

258
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:42,522
You could get a subpoena anytime
and we need to be ready.

259
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,108
Okay. Uh, I can't do that right now.
I have bigger fish.

260
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:47,068
Bigger fish than staying out of prison?

261
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,821
Look, I'll message you a time.

262
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:53,074
And ahead of our interview,
I need to look over these papers in detail

263
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:57,120
and then we can talk through
what the government gets and when.

264
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:01,541
- Let me think.
- Ken, the FBI

265
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,042
maybe showing up at your door now.

266
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:05,211
They could be getting a search warrant
for your apartment.

267
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:08,214
Big picture. What are you hearing?

268
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:13,678
Well, your dad is pushing political buttons.

269
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:18,933
There's talk he might play hardball
and not cooperate, which would be amazing.

270
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,686
I mean, that's just a really
terrible, terrible decision.

271
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:24,814
- What if he shuts this all down?
- He can't shut it down.

272
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:27,233
Oh, yes, he can. I mean, he might.

273
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:30,320
You need to prepare for all eventualities.
We might need to...

274
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:32,238
to call the state police to arrest the FBI.

275
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:34,949
We might need to plan to fly me out
without a tail number to...

276
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,243
- to Frankfurt or Venezuela.
- Yeah.

277
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,829
I'm not serious, okay?
But I am serious.

278
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:43,875
- Hey.
- "Hey, how goes it?"

279
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,044
Yeah. Good. Fine. Why? What's up?

280
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:51,883
- "Just, um, wondering where you are."
- Me? I'm at home.

281
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:55,928
- "Just taking five."
- Okay.

282
00:19:56,054 --> 00:20:00,391
Well, just checking in, seeing how you are.
Uh, do you mind about Gerri?

283
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:03,061
Uh, what? No. Gerri? No. It's fine.

284
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:08,024
It's, uh, just, uh, another
fucking humiliation.

285
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:13,071
Well... yeah.
Talk to me if there's big stuff.

286
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:17,325
Uh-huh. Will do. Thanks for checking in
and, you know, I love you.

287
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:20,411
Thank you.

288
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,499
And do you... do you love me too?

289
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:26,459
- "Why?"
- Why?

290
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:28,878
- Why do you wanna know?
- "The fuck?"

291
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:32,298
I just feel like it's a pretty important thing
to know whether you do or not.

292
00:20:32,423 --> 00:20:36,844
You know, you can't just take my love
and bank it,

293
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:41,265
and then take a view of the love market
and see if you wanna invest in me.

294
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:46,521
But, um, yeah, I do.

295
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:50,983
- I do.
- Great. Because I do too.

296
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:55,947
Thank you. It's good to know we...
we don't have an unbalanced love portfolio.

297
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:58,616
I love you.

298
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,958
Okay. Well, lookey-lookey here.

299
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,626
Who's all this then, huh?

300
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:11,254
- Hi.
- Hi. Okay. Well, fuck me.

301
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:14,048
I wondered but all right. Okay.

302
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:16,092
- Uh, how is he?
- How is he?

303
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,677
- Yeah.
- He's wondering where the fuck you are.

304
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:21,722
- How come you're not picking up?
- Oh, I've had my phone off.

305
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:25,768
- No agenda.
- No agenda? None at all?

306
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,064
- How is he?
- He's fucking, you know...

307
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,525
he's fine, I guess.
Gerri's looking into how it works

308
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,237
to buy a private island in the Philippines,
so regular stuff.

309
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:41,659
- What is your fucking game?
- Why? What's yours?

310
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:45,246
- I'm here looking for you.
- Yeah. Oh, sure. Sure.

311
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,832
As far as you know, that's the fucking truth.

312
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:51,377
It's true. I'm hearing footsteps.

313
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:54,881
- Oh, here he comes. The attention whore.
- Hey, Rome.

314
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:56,591
- Hello.
- How you doing?

315
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,093
Oh wow, thank you for asking.
I'm great.

316
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,429
It's just been like a really
great few days, actually.

317
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,723
- How about you, how you doin'?
- I feel pretty good.

318
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:08,561
Certain amount of regret
but, you know, pretty cleansed.

319
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:12,690
Cleansed? That's interesting.
That's like really fucking interesting.

320
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,109
I guess if I wanted to know
how you're actually doing,

321
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:18,988
I'd have to wait for you to, you know,
call a national fucking press conference,

322
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:25,119
and you'd be like, "No, I said I was fine,
but actually I'm not fine."

323
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:30,666
"Roman is a dick, and he didn't even
bring me anything from the airport."

324
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,210
"Now I feel bad."

325
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:36,047
I did, actually. I brought you those Danish
cinnamon things from the wherever place.

326
00:22:36,172 --> 00:22:37,548
- Oh, that's...
- The... the...

327
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:41,302
- That's sweet. That is so kind. Thank you.
- Oh. Oh, shut up. Just eat them or don't.

328
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,803
You're welcome.

329
00:22:46,807 --> 00:22:49,519
- You take a look?
- Oh, yeah. Fuck you too.

330
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:54,315
Yeah. So, look, guys, can we clean slate this?

331
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,570
You didn't like how I did what I did to dad.
Sure. Whatever. I'm sorry.

332
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:02,114
You know, that's for me and him.

333
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:03,783
But here's the thing.

334
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:08,788
He's over, so let's work together
to take over and help him move on out.

335
00:23:08,913 --> 00:23:14,627
Um, well, I'm just here
to spy on this one, so...

336
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,880
And I'm just here to get you to back down.

337
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,676
Sorry.

338
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,594
I'm sorry, I wanna tell you
what a fucking prick you are,

339
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,429
but can we do it where we don't have
to fold in Rava's dog walker?

340
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:28,307
Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Follow me.

341
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,439
- Sophie's room.
- You don't remember this kid's name?

342
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:38,150
"Uh, uh, Sophie... Sophie's room."

343
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:42,446
Okay. Just here. Thank you. Five stars.

344
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:53,124
Hey, Gramps. Oh, thanks for this.

345
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:57,628
Big Gramps in the big city. Hey, how you
doing? What... what are you doing here?

346
00:23:57,753 --> 00:24:00,715
I am putting my affairs in order.

347
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,634
Very nice. Very nice.

348
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,264
Your publicity shy friend,
the shrinking violet, has been calling me.

349
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:10,933
- What does he want?
- Kendall. Well, so I...

350
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:14,020
I think he's very much
on the same page as you.

351
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:16,772
If it doesn't sound too basic
to be like good, right?

352
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:20,735
Make the company nice and so on,
which... which I guess is...

353
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,486
that's kind of your thing, right?

354
00:24:23,237 --> 00:24:28,451
I found his performance
histrionic and meretricious.

355
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:30,911
Well, tell me about it.

356
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,793
- The man is a self-regarding popinjay.
- No, sure.

357
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:41,297
I just don't like seeing dirty
laundry washed in public.

358
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:43,299
Right? Uh, yeah.

359
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:46,594
And that's... and that's actually why...
why I wanted to chat with you.

360
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,597
I just wanna chart the right course
through this whole thing.

361
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,683
And Logan's offering me a lawyer
and Kendall's offering me a lawyer.

362
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:55,394
And I just, you know, I'm try...

363
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,813
I think I could use some
independent legal advice.

364
00:24:57,938 --> 00:25:02,693
- Why do you need a lawyer, Greg?
- I mean, I haven't done anything wrong.

365
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,572
I... I... I just think if everyone's
showing up to battle in armor,

366
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:09,784
then I feel kind of expose here
in my loincloth.

367
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:12,995
Bad visual.

368
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,835
- Yes.
- Yes?

369
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,590
Yes, I can back you, Greg.
I'll set you up with legal counsel.

370
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:28,177
Thank you. Thank you, Gramps.
So... Yeah. Sorry. Sorry.

371
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:30,137
That'll do. Thank you. I'll call you.

372
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,723
- All right. You're the man.
- Soon.

373
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:35,101
I love you.

374
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:38,354
Okay. Don't touch any of her shit.

375
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,110
Okay. So, uh, it's pretty simple.

376
00:25:44,318 --> 00:25:48,531
- Let's gang up on dad and take him down.
- Jesus, let me shut the door first.

377
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:53,953
Okay. Well, why didn't you come to us before?
Yeah? This is a real fucking mess now.

378
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:58,999
It came together for me in my head late
and, uh, you know, it wasn't...

379
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:02,586
- I... I knew what I was gonna do but...
- That was spontaneous?

380
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,339
Well, I spoke with a lawyer.

381
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:08,384
- Oh. Okay. You spoke with a lawyer?
- Yeah. But...

382
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:12,012
but they advised against, essentially.
I mean, I...

383
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:15,850
I... and don't wanna rehash it all but...
look, I was effectively acting alone.

384
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:20,271
Right. A spontaneous, heart-felt outpouring
of thoroughly lawyered emotion.

385
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:24,275
You guys can think whatever you want,
in the end, of me.

386
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,615
Okay. Well, you've made this very hard.

387
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:37,663
But I'm here to find out what
you want and to get you to back down.

388
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:39,874
Yeah. On dad's behalf.

389
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:44,128
Oh, right. Right. Right.

390
00:26:46,422 --> 00:26:50,801
So if I say, I'm taking him down
and I'm not interested in any deals with him,

391
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:53,721
you just... you call and tell him,
and just take a hike?

392
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,222
Yeah.

393
00:26:55,473 --> 00:26:56,891
- He's here.
- Who's here?

394
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,393
- Connor. Send him in.
- Right.

395
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:00,895
I thought I heard a clown car pulling up.

396
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,689
Ideally I'd like to make a media appearance
all four of us.

397
00:27:03,814 --> 00:27:05,816
- Oh, would you?
- Oh, sweet.

398
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:08,194
Are we gonna be wearing costumes
that you've designed, asshole?

399
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,946
Yeah. That's just not gonna happen.

400
00:27:14,742 --> 00:27:16,118
- Hey.
- Okay.

401
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,870
- Well... Thanks for coming.
- Hey, Con.

402
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:19,663
Here we all are.

403
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:25,127
- You know, Pop's looking for you two.
- Yeah. We're here on his behalf.

404
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:29,423
Oh, sure thing, honey. Me too. All about dad.
That's why we're all here.

405
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:36,055
Okay. Can... can we, uh, turn off the devices
and get into this?

406
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:47,358
So... my thing is if this shit was just
epiphenomenal, maybe it could be written out.

407
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:51,987
But these incidents are symptomatic
of a foundational sickness

408
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:53,489
within our father and his company.

409
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:56,951
Hmm, don't he use that tongue prettier
than a 20-dollar whore?

410
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,786
Yeah. Like, what's your point?

411
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:02,456
- My point is the milk is going sour.
- Well, that explains it.

412
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,501
You know, the... the Great Whites,
from politics to culture,

413
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:08,712
they're rolling off stage. It's our time.

414
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:14,718
Oh, you mean, us, this multi-fucking-ethnic
transgender alliance

415
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:16,762
of 20-something dreamers we got right here?

416
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,640
Okay. Big picture.

417
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:22,643
We're at the end of the long American century.

418
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,522
Our company is a declining empire
inside a declining empire.

419
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:29,066
- Amen, brother.
- People are... are...

420
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:33,153
killing themselves with guns or dope
so fast that we're losing pace.

421
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,407
- Unsubscribe.
- We're... we're fat-fingered fucks

422
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:38,409
and we can only live on cream.

423
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,578
US supremacy is waning.

424
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:46,625
What I think is, within that context,
we can become omni-national and reposition.

425
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,753
Because actually we are not tied,
culturally or physically.

426
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:53,841
So... so we are actually
in a great position to leapfrog tech.

427
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:58,470
Information is going to be more precious
than water in the next hundred.

428
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:03,601
Combine all our news operations,
become the global news information hub.

429
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,479
Amazon is 20 years old.
Gates is an old geezer.

430
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:11,233
Detoxify our brand and we can go supersonic.

431
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,032
So what do you say? Are we interested?

432
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,952
You know, there's just something
about betraying our father

433
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:24,330
that just doesn't sit well with me.

434
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:29,710
He's a central player in a rotten cabal
that has basically eaten...

435
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:32,087
- Okay. Well...
- the heart out of American democracy.

436
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:34,173
Rotten cabal is a good name for a band.

437
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:36,550
He's not gonna be on trial
for that though, Ken.

438
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,802
- Well, maybe he should be.
- You know, but if he didn't do it,

439
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:41,847
it would have been someone else
making the same dollar off the same shit.

440
00:29:41,972 --> 00:29:43,474
- Maybe. Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah.

441
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,768
Ma... Maybe we're all irrelevant.

442
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:47,353
You know, maybe there were always going
to be death camps

443
00:29:47,478 --> 00:29:50,648
and maybe the planet is going to fry
and there's nothing we can do.

444
00:29:50,773 --> 00:29:53,859
Or maybe people make a difference.

445
00:29:55,444 --> 00:29:57,863
I don't know. Do...
do you think human beings matter?

446
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:01,158
You know, I'm just gonna say
right out that I'm a spy.

447
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:04,870
I'm gonna go back and tell him everything.
I'm with dad. So, yeah, fuck you.

448
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:07,623
Fine. Fine. I... I don't actually give a fuck.
You know, I'm...

449
00:30:07,748 --> 00:30:11,460
I can perfectly well do this alone. I'm
actually just trying to be openhearted and...

450
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:13,629
and invite you in here.

451
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:16,548
I mean, it would probably be simpler
to go alone

452
00:30:16,674 --> 00:30:20,010
but I want to offer you a fucking ticket
to the escape pod.

453
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:21,929
Nice fucking guy, huh?

454
00:30:24,974 --> 00:30:27,893
You're happy he went over your head
and put in Gerri?

455
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:31,397
I think that Gerri is a good choice, yeah.

456
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:34,191
- What?
- Whatever. Defend dad all you want,

457
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:36,276
- but Gerri can look after herself.
- Yeah, I know that.

458
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:40,322
- I'm not defending Gerri. I'm saying...
- You can't hide under the covers with mommy.

459
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:43,534
- Oh, fuck off, Shivan.
- You love showing your pee-pee to everyone,

460
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:45,703
but someday you know you're actually
gonna have to fuck something.

461
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:47,371
- Fuck you. Bitch.
- Rom...

462
00:30:47,997 --> 00:30:50,249
- What? Leave it.
- Rom, just...

463
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:51,750
- What?
- Rom?

464
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:59,091
Okay. Fine. I'll... That was low.

465
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:00,801
That was an overreaction. That was not.

466
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:04,930
Can we just try to keep this nice? Yeah?

467
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:15,149
It's not my fault he's got a sex thing.
Was I too harsh?

468
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:16,650
Are you kidding? He loves it.

469
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:19,236
He'll be out there jerking off
wearing my ex-wife's panties.

470
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,040
- Welcome to Sarajevo.
- Thank you.

471
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:47,139
Thank you.

472
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:50,184
- Those fucking kids of yours...
- I know.

473
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:55,647
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

474
00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:00,694
It's not a good time to be estranged, Marcia.

475
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:07,951
- Boy. Proxy battle.
- I was very hurt, Logan.

476
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,330
- I know.
- So?

477
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:14,708
I can't eat shit, Marcia.

478
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:17,544
I just can't.

479
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:21,256
But...

480
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:25,719
You're a fool.

481
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:35,020
I can sometimes get... distracted.

482
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:54,373
Of course, I might like to have
small conversation with somebody.

483
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:03,257
- This way. Good evening, Marcia.
- Good evening.

484
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,718
- Welcome.
- Thank you very much.

485
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,226
- Sorry.
- For what? I went to the bathroom.

486
00:33:14,351 --> 00:33:16,228
I don't give a shit.

487
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:17,980
You whore.

488
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:21,108
Okay. Here's how I see this.

489
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:24,987
Dad is complicated...

490
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:30,909
...but he did or let bad stuff happen. Yeah?

491
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:33,370
And now it's a part of us and our sickness.

492
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:36,331
And we have to take responsibility
because we knew

493
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:40,961
and this is our chance to pay our dues
and wash our hands for absolution.

494
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:44,882
Uh, okay. Well, hmm, I didn't know.

495
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:47,217
Sure, whatever, but yeah, you did.

496
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:50,304
Uh, no, I... I... I didn't.

497
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:55,517
- Did you, Rom?
- No, I didn't. No. No.

498
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,436
- No?
- No.

499
00:33:57,561 --> 00:34:00,606
The fucking pipeline of sad dancers
who got used and abused

500
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:02,900
and promised some Hollywood bullshit.
We fucking knew.

501
00:34:03,025 --> 00:34:07,362
Right. No, I... I mean, I kind of knew...
you know, that there was...

502
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:11,116
but I didn't know to the fucking...
I didn't. I really did not.

503
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:12,826
Oh, come on. We knew.

504
00:34:13,577 --> 00:34:15,162
- What?
- We fucking knew, okay?

505
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,081
And I... and I... I don't like bullshit, okay?
I'm done. Enough.

506
00:34:18,207 --> 00:34:20,292
- Well, okay, but what did we know?
- Yeah.

507
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:23,253
I'm not saying that you're responsible, Shiv,

508
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:28,175
- but the guys, Dad, Mo, the wolf pack.
- We knew.

509
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:31,553
The jokes and the vibe to women and to the...

510
00:34:31,678 --> 00:34:36,058
to the grubby fat asses who took the cruises,
the blind eye, and the payoffs,

511
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:39,895
and the hush-hush about dad's pals,
or foreign workers who got crushed like...

512
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,191
like meat in a fucking grinder
with zero training, and the border barrel,

513
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:48,737
and clean out the rats in the hold.
And, you know, no, it wasn't our fault.

514
00:34:48,862 --> 00:34:52,908
And you want to pretend your shit
doesn't stink, be my guest, but... but we...

515
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:54,993
- We knew. We knew what those guys
- Thank you.

516
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:58,247
- in dad's study were laughing about.
- Oh, no, I didn't know the dancers

517
00:34:58,372 --> 00:34:59,748
were fucking for their jobs.

518
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:02,292
And I didn't know that we threw
fucking migrants off boats

519
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,670
and covered it up as
a matter of secret company policy.

520
00:35:04,795 --> 00:35:06,171
No, I didn't know what
they were laughing about.

521
00:35:06,296 --> 00:35:07,881
- Don't get in the pool with Mo.
- Yeah.

522
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:10,008
I didn't get in the pool
with any of those fucking creeps.

523
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:12,177
Yeah, because he'd let a gang
of creeps run cruises.

524
00:35:12,302 --> 00:35:15,430
- No, Kendall, 'cause I was 15.
- Yeah, well, you know now, right?

525
00:35:15,555 --> 00:35:16,932
- Do you know now?
- Of course, I fucking know now.

526
00:35:17,057 --> 00:35:19,434
Okay. This is all a sidebar. Okay?

527
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:26,358
We... all I am asking is for us
to move forward from a position of truth.

528
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:31,154
And are we excluded from the kingdom of heaven
unless we accept the one true truth?

529
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:41,373
Look, the kids are... I'll go... uh,
I just wanna hug my kids. Okay?

530
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:43,208
I'll be right back.

531
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:46,878
We don't even need to get into this. Okay?

532
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,839
This is side shit.

533
00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:53,302
I'll be right back.

534
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,360
Thanks for the horse, man. Pretty funny.

535
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:12,779
Yeah. Well, I wanted to send a real one.
Well, a severed head.

536
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,281
But you wouldn't believe the paperwork.

537
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:17,826
Look, sorry I couldn't, you know, fold you in
or alert you on the press conference.

538
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:20,746
Dude, I got to see the Vietnamese monk
set himself on fire.

539
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:23,165
I got a ticket to the greatest
freak show on Earth.

540
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,585
So... so, look, how does this play?
From the point of view of...

541
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,963
- Do you actually have a case?
- Yes. I can kill it.

542
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,216
Okay. Good. We're all ears.

543
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:35,844
But I don't see it, dude.

544
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,597
Let's talk.

545
00:36:41,725 --> 00:36:44,394
Hey, Sandi, thanks for coming over.

546
00:36:45,354 --> 00:36:48,523
- It wasn't terribly convenient.
- No? Well, sure.

547
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:51,943
I guess, nor would losing the proxy vote
for you and your dad.

548
00:36:53,987 --> 00:36:56,656
- Dad, you're on.
- Hey, Sandy.

549
00:36:57,741 --> 00:36:59,409
- "Hello."
- Okay. Look

550
00:36:59,534 --> 00:37:02,996
so I can give you two hours, two minutes,
or two words.

551
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,706
Ooh, shorter's better.

552
00:37:04,998 --> 00:37:07,709
- Back me.
- Well, maybe a little more.

553
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:13,173
Look, Sandy, we all know you are
kind of not really but, yeah, really

554
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:16,468
- doing this to beat my dad.
- My father doesn't operate that way.

555
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:19,596
He's in this because
of the business fundamentals.

556
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:22,349
Sure. Sure.

557
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:29,022
Well, look, the offer we made Stewy in Greece,
we stick with all that,

558
00:37:29,272 --> 00:37:32,692
but, plus, my dad's gone, yeah?

559
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,320
And when my dad offers you
the board seats and all,

560
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:38,615
one way or another,
he's gonna sideline you, right?

561
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:43,078
But when my team offers a strategic review,
we mean it.

562
00:37:44,621 --> 00:37:46,248
And what do you want today, Ken?

563
00:37:46,373 --> 00:37:49,292
Today, I just...
I just want the conversation,

564
00:37:49,418 --> 00:37:51,753
and... and an understanding
if we push him out,

565
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:56,007
then we can avoid a, uh, you know,
contested shareholder vote.

566
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:01,054
"Hi, Marcia.
Everyone's so happy you're back."

567
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,889
Good. I'm very happy.

568
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,101
"We were thinking we could discreetly
agree some words"

569
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:10,230
"in terms of, um, where you've been
and where the relationship is at."

570
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,940
- Of course.
- Great.

571
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:15,819
And in terms of the optics on this,
if you'd find it acceptable,

572
00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:20,031
we would love to get back visually
to the Logan that we all know

573
00:38:20,157 --> 00:38:24,369
and his wife back by his side
so that if we fly or if we go...

574
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:27,372
Obviously, I have some requests.

575
00:38:27,664 --> 00:38:29,166
Oh, okay. Right.

576
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:33,170
I was quite humiliated
by his infatuation with that woman.

577
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:38,341
- Karolina, do you wanna...
- "No, you go ahead, Hugo."

578
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:44,764
I mean, I think Logan's position,
and it's the truth, is that...

579
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,393
I was humiliated
and things must be made right.

580
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:52,522
- Nothing needs to be said.
- He was led by his prick.

581
00:38:53,648 --> 00:38:56,568
Because we really would say
that nothing ever happened.

582
00:38:56,693 --> 00:39:00,530
She's a whore and it's not my problem
if she wouldn't finish him.

583
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:06,495
- Got it. Got the message.
- So for my return to be public,

584
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:13,126
I will need my role on the trust finalized,
Amir's prospects assured,

585
00:39:13,502 --> 00:39:18,548
my daughter taken care of,
and improvements in my financial position.

586
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,843
Celeste will deal with the details.

587
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,013
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

588
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:31,478
Now, the numbers I'm going to propose
will sound like very, very large numbers,

589
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:35,273
but if you consider them in terms
of the difficulties it would present Mr. Roy

590
00:39:35,398 --> 00:39:39,945
to have an acrimonious divorce announced
ahead of a contested shareholder meeting,

591
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,323
then they start to seem
like very reasonable numbers.

592
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:44,824
I do worry.

593
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:50,080
I was assured that yours is the best facility
for the storage of fine wines,

594
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:54,417
but now I'm looking at a geological survey
and it's worrying me.

595
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:57,671
- So?
- What?

596
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:05,554
- Where you at?
- Just, uh, hear him out and report, right?

597
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:09,015
- Right. Oh, yeah. We gotta protect dad.
- Yeah.

598
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:13,186
Because if we knifed him now,
it's true he would bleed out, so...

599
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:17,566
- I don't know about that.
- Well, it's just true.

600
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:23,029
- Well, I'm not sure I care to speculate.
- No, it was just a statement of fact.

601
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,865
- Is it now?
- Yeah.

602
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:28,410
Well, then why are you making
fuck-y eyes at me?

603
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:30,328
- I'm not making fuck-y eyes at you.
- Yeah, you are.

604
00:40:30,453 --> 00:40:32,497
- You're making fuck-y eyes. You're like...
- What are fuck-y...

605
00:40:33,373 --> 00:40:34,749
- Like...
- Oh, those are my eyes?

606
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:36,585
- Bleed out.
- Jesus!

607
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,378
A little bit though.
Stop trying to convince me of shit.

608
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:43,216
It's not necessarily true even.
Maybe someone else, but this is dad.

609
00:40:43,883 --> 00:40:46,386
And he's like fucking Moby Dick.

610
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:50,307
He could take us all down
with his back riddled with harpoons.

611
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,392
- A... All three of us?
- Yeah.

612
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:57,731
And Con?
We back Ken, no, he's toast.

613
00:40:59,399 --> 00:41:02,110
I'm not saying we should do it.

614
00:41:02,235 --> 00:41:06,531
We just need to decide what the fuck
we're gonna do because this is a moment.

615
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:11,119
I mean, what do you think?

616
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:14,664
Uh, first Rhea. Now Gerri.

617
00:41:15,248 --> 00:41:17,459
Uh, it doesn't... it's not great.

618
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:20,629
Well, I don't know,
I don't think dad would actually go.

619
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:23,256
- Do you, Con?
- He's not infallible, Rom.

620
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:27,677
No. Sure.
I just don't think he ever fails or ever will.

621
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:31,765
He... What? He missteps all the time.
He's not dad from 20 years ago.

622
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,184
He's... he's now dad.

623
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:38,313
It's very hard to imagine him surviving
if we allied and backed Kendall.

624
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:44,069
Yes. Exactly. And if we squared Frank
and Karl, then he is toast.

625
00:41:44,194 --> 00:41:46,655
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Yes-by.

626
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,366
- Uh, but it's his board.
- Oh, yeah. Oh. Sure.

627
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:52,243
But a lot of fresh blood is a lot of fear.

628
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:56,498
I think if we pulled the pin today, tomorrow,
a spooked board, we could win.

629
00:41:56,623 --> 00:42:00,168
My only concern with that,
it might actually kill him.

630
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,254
Okay. How we doing?

631
00:42:04,798 --> 00:42:06,216
So where are we?

632
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:11,638
All right. Look, you win, take dad out,
I...

633
00:42:12,347 --> 00:42:14,265
I don't see us coming through
in the proxy battle.

634
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:17,686
Shareholders, they don't like confusion.
How does the family stay in control?

635
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:21,439
We give dad the revolver,
show him to his office, proxy battle is over.

636
00:42:21,898 --> 00:42:24,401
Sandi and Stewy would back down.
I've spoken with them.

637
00:42:24,526 --> 00:42:26,486
- Busy fucking bee.
- No vote.

638
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,780
- We have a settlement.
- Really?

639
00:42:28,905 --> 00:42:31,866
I think if dad went fast, yeah.

640
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,787
Look, guys, I don't know
what I think about dad.

641
00:42:35,912 --> 00:42:40,500
Uh, I love him. I hate him.
I'm gonna outsource it to my therapist.

642
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:44,212
But he was going to send me to jail, you know?

643
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,882
And he'd do the same to you, Rom.

644
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:53,263
And Con. Shiv, I don't know.

645
00:42:54,556 --> 00:42:55,932
I don't know. Maybe.

646
00:42:57,225 --> 00:42:59,436
So what do we owe him here, really?

647
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:06,359
Well, what would the shape of this new fucking
reality be anyway, us leapfrogging Amazon?

648
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:10,864
Yeah. Well, uh, we're...
we're looking at, uh, 323 B.C., basically.

649
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:13,450
- Oh, yeah, naturally.
- Alexander is dead.

650
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:17,954
I take Asia. You take Egypt.
Shiv takes Europe.

651
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,082
- Con, the rest of the world.
- Right.

652
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:23,168
- Thanks.
- Separate divisions.

653
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:27,922
I could oversee us as CEO on paper
as we shift to these spheres of influence

654
00:43:28,047 --> 00:43:30,258
and evaluate what is core as we move forward.

655
00:43:30,383 --> 00:43:31,926
So you'll oversee us?

656
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:34,554
Well, I'd offer my leadership initially
as a... as a...

657
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,474
you know, as a necessary part
of a transformational process.

658
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,017
You would do that for us?

659
00:43:39,142 --> 00:43:41,102
- Dude, I'm... Come on.
- Oh, you're so generous. Thanks, Ken.

660
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:43,688
Well, no, because in your position
that just doesn't work.

661
00:43:43,813 --> 00:43:45,648
- It's a stretch.
- It's a stretch.

662
00:43:45,774 --> 00:43:48,318
It's a fucking scrotum over a timpani drum.

663
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:51,613
If I were to back you against dad,
I would need to take over.

664
00:43:51,738 --> 00:43:53,948
- Uh, what? Whoa.
- Here we go.

665
00:43:54,073 --> 00:43:55,909
Whoa, Nelly.

666
00:43:56,576 --> 00:43:59,579
You know, I wish I could,
but you don't have the experience,

667
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,749
so that's not possible right now.
I wish it was but it isn't.

668
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:06,085
Come on. You're a busted flush.
I'm the only person who can reform.

669
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:09,798
You're too divisive.
You're still seen... I don't see you this way,

670
00:44:09,923 --> 00:44:14,010
but you're still seen as a token woman wonk
woke snowflake. I don't think that...

671
00:44:14,135 --> 00:44:15,512
- What?
- ...but the market does.

672
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:17,639
- Bullshit.
- Well, it's true. I just spoke to the market.

673
00:44:17,764 --> 00:44:21,100
- That's exactly what the market thinks.
- Guys, interim chair. Okay?

674
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:27,106
New directors, clean broom, and then
we can figure out how to split the spoils.

675
00:44:28,775 --> 00:44:30,193
Uh, I have some calls to make.

676
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:32,237
Well, I actually do have
some calls to make, so...

677
00:44:32,362 --> 00:44:34,405
- No. Unrelated.
- Take a moment.

678
00:44:36,157 --> 00:44:39,327
But this stays in here, yeah?

679
00:44:40,203 --> 00:44:42,872
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

680
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,377
Okay.

681
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,305
"Uh, hey, Tom."

682
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:03,476
Can you, uh... can you talk?

683
00:45:05,895 --> 00:45:07,480
- Yeah.
- "Okay."

684
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:12,986
- So I'm with Ken.
- Oh. Wow. You are?

685
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:15,989
- Did you know?
- No, I... no. Why would I know?

686
00:45:17,907 --> 00:45:22,662
Uh, so he's... he's offering an alliance.

687
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:24,789
Me, Rom, Con, we take down dad.

688
00:45:24,914 --> 00:45:27,750
- Shit.
- "Yeah. Yeah."

689
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:30,461
- What do you think?
- I don't know. Is...

690
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,673
- how is he? Is he okay?
- "Uh, he's okay."

691
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:38,553
- Uh, the Bosnians want us to leave. Maybe.
- "Fuck."

692
00:45:38,678 --> 00:45:44,058
So, fuck, what do you... what do you think?
If we got you, Frank...

693
00:45:44,183 --> 00:45:49,898
Right. That's terminal, I guess.
But then who ends up king potato?

694
00:45:50,189 --> 00:45:53,443
- "I... Is it you?"
- Uh, maybe. I don't know. I...

695
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,987
I mean, I'm nobody is the thing.

696
00:45:56,112 --> 00:45:58,364
I've never worked in the company,
and I don't even have a fucking job title.

697
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,825
What... but...

698
00:46:01,534 --> 00:46:03,369
"you can see it though, can't you?"

699
00:46:03,912 --> 00:46:06,706
- Yeah.
- You can see it.

700
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,419
- "Yeah?"
- Hey, Gerr Bear.

701
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:17,634
So I'm just gonna put my dick
in your mad scheming Scissorhands here.

702
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:19,135
Roman...

703
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:23,973
I'm at Kendall's, and he wants us to join up
with him and take down dad.

704
00:46:25,892 --> 00:46:29,687
"So, yeah.
Nightmare for you if that happens."

705
00:46:29,812 --> 00:46:33,858
But for a moment, put that aside,
which obviously you can't,

706
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:37,320
but if I do that, what happens?

707
00:46:37,612 --> 00:46:40,990
Um, if you all come out and work the board,

708
00:46:42,575 --> 00:46:45,161
honestly, yeah, I think that zaps your dad.

709
00:46:45,286 --> 00:46:48,247
Right. And then who takes over, do you think?

710
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:52,585
Is it... is it gonna be Kendall,
or possibly me, Shiv?

711
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,339
No, I don't think any of you come through.
It's snake linguini.

712
00:46:56,464 --> 00:47:02,220
I mean, maybe Sandi picks. Maybe.
I don't know. But honestly, no.

713
00:47:02,345 --> 00:47:04,555
I think you all get burnt.

714
00:47:04,806 --> 00:47:07,225
But obviously I can't trust you.

715
00:47:07,684 --> 00:47:13,523
I mean, your advice is so compromised
as to be completely worthless,

716
00:47:14,315 --> 00:47:16,359
but what is your advice?

717
00:47:16,484 --> 00:47:20,571
Stick with me, Roman.
We have something going.

718
00:47:21,656 --> 00:47:26,995
And I'm an incredibly dangerous enemy to whom
you've just imparted prejudicial information.

719
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,623
Well, don't threaten me Gerri.
I don't have time to jerk off.

720
00:47:30,873 --> 00:47:32,375
"So what are you gonna do?"

721
00:47:41,843 --> 00:47:43,845
Dad sent doughnuts.

722
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,348
- What the fuck?
- Dad has sent

723
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:51,019
some perfectly innocent
and I'm sure safe-to-eat donuts.

724
00:47:51,144 --> 00:47:53,855
He wants us all to have a nice tea party.

725
00:47:54,522 --> 00:47:55,898
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

726
00:47:57,275 --> 00:48:00,486
- He's gonna know. Of course, he is.
- Well, did you tell him?

727
00:48:01,404 --> 00:48:04,449
Shiv, come on.
Why would I tell him?

728
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:07,994
Well... I wouldn't.

729
00:48:10,038 --> 00:48:13,166
I mean, no, of course.
Uh, yeah, I mean...

730
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:16,502
You think he would send poisoned doughnuts
to the house of his grandchildren?

731
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:20,465
No, I'm like 98% sure
those are not poisoned.

732
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:26,763
- Okay. These are irrelevant, so...
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

733
00:48:26,888 --> 00:48:29,474
These... these are relevant doughnuts.

734
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,351
So do we wanna?

735
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,021
Guys? You wanna?

736
00:48:36,439 --> 00:48:38,566
I'll make the call right now.

737
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:43,946
We'll say it tonight. It's over.
We're in. New dawn.

738
00:48:49,202 --> 00:48:52,246
Con, stop looking
at the fucking doughnuts, man.

739
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:54,957
Okay. Focus.

740
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,088
I'm out.

741
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:03,966
Well, fine. You're irrelevant.

742
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:05,593
- Hey, fuck you.
- Go on. Go.

743
00:49:05,718 --> 00:49:07,095
- No. Come on.
- You're not wanted.

744
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,596
- Come on. No.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

745
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:10,139
- Yeah, you're not wanted.
- Because... You're not wanted.

746
00:49:10,264 --> 00:49:11,641
- So you know... you know...
- No. You're not wanted.

747
00:49:11,766 --> 00:49:13,476
- I love this.
- You're not wanted.

748
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:16,020
Like he hasn't heard that enough in his life.

749
00:49:23,611 --> 00:49:25,905
- Roman.
- Yeah, howdy. What's up?

750
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,908
- Let's do this.
- Uh, pass.

751
00:49:29,492 --> 00:49:30,910
Pass? Why?

752
00:49:31,077 --> 00:49:33,204
- A number of reasons.
- Like what?

753
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:38,668
You... you think I can't win?
Dude, we will win this together.

754
00:49:39,836 --> 00:49:44,215
We'll fucking win. I mean, come on, man.
What...what I eat don't make you shit.

755
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,385
- There's enough for us all.
- Uh, like I said, I'm with dad.

756
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:51,013
- I have been. I always have been. Told you.
- You're a fucking moron.

757
00:49:54,433 --> 00:49:58,312
- Shiv, forget them...
- I'm with dad.

758
00:50:00,982 --> 00:50:03,234
- Why?
- Why? I don't need to tell you.

759
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,445
Yes, you fucking do.
Is it the goddamn donuts?

760
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:11,075
Have you been spooked by fucking doughnuts?
That's pathetic, Shiv. Why?

761
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,577
You owe me an explanation.

762
00:50:12,702 --> 00:50:15,580
Oh, yeah, 'cause you've always been
very careful to keep me fully informed.

763
00:50:15,705 --> 00:50:19,458
What is it? You... you don't believe me?
Obviously, you believe me.

764
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:22,795
So you're literally doing
the wrong thing over the right thing.

765
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,714
0 That's what you're doing?
- I can see that you're angry,

766
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,300
but please don't project your disappointment
on to me, okay?

767
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:31,220
There are times to be someone.

768
00:50:33,055 --> 00:50:34,974
- It's high tide.
- Okay.

769
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,560
- It's high tide.
- Right. I ought to go.

770
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:45,484
I mean, i... i... is it cowardice or avarice?
I'm intrigued.

771
00:50:47,987 --> 00:50:50,239
It's because you don't take over. Is that it?

772
00:50:50,364 --> 00:50:53,034
Well, good luck with sleeping on that, Shiv.

773
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:56,412
- Fuck you, plastic Jesus.
- You're a fucking twat.

774
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:00,791
I was the only one you wanted. Yeah?
I was the only one who mattered.

775
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:03,711
Yeah. Only 'cause you're the girl.
Girls count double now, didn't you know?

776
00:51:03,836 --> 00:51:05,796
Oh, yeah. No, I know. I fucking know.

777
00:51:05,922 --> 00:51:08,090
It's only your teats that give you any value.

778
00:51:08,216 --> 00:51:10,718
So, you know, it's only your teats.

779
00:51:14,055 --> 00:51:15,806
You're calling it wrong.

780
00:51:16,057 --> 00:51:19,435
And you're fucking over the victims.
And you're fucking the company at the AGM.

781
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:24,482
And therefore renewal at the company and...
and the country and probably the planet.

782
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:28,402
- So well done, dipshit.
- I just don't wanna destroy dad.

783
00:51:28,569 --> 00:51:30,988
I'm a national figure.
It's not right to kill one's father.

784
00:51:31,113 --> 00:51:32,490
- Yeah, you're a prick.
- History teaches us that.

785
00:51:32,615 --> 00:51:35,117
- You're a national fucking prick.
- Yeah.

786
00:51:35,243 --> 00:51:36,619
Save the planet, Ken.

787
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:39,455
- You're a fucking prick. Goodnight.
- Oh, thanks for telling me in person

788
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,375
- Goodnight, you fucking prick. Idiot.
- instead of calling a press conference.

789
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:46,087
- What?
- Those...

790
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:57,014
"What's also unclear is what's next
for the largest family-run media empire"

791
00:51:57,139 --> 00:51:58,766
"in the United States."

792
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:02,687
"It's long been believed that Logan Roy
wanted to keep it in the family"

793
00:52:02,812 --> 00:52:06,816
"when he decides to step aside,
passing the reins of his..."

794
00:52:10,194 --> 00:52:12,780
I think I need to get back to the city.

795
00:52:13,447 --> 00:52:18,286
- People need to see a little family unity.
- Of course.

796
00:52:20,454 --> 00:52:23,791
And you do have things you could say,
no, to stop him?

797
00:52:25,793 --> 00:52:29,880
You drop some bombs,
you get burned too, you know?

798
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,550
- Shiv?
- Roman.

799
00:52:33,843 --> 00:52:36,095
- Hey, Romulus.
- Hey, Pop.

800
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:39,849
- "You got her?"
- Who? The one who matters?

801
00:52:39,974 --> 00:52:41,475
Yeah, I'm with her.

802
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:44,312
"Was she there? Was she wobbly?"

803
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:49,900
No. No. Uh, she was trying to get to Ken
to push him off course.

804
00:52:50,693 --> 00:52:53,487
Yeah, she was dark 'cause she
was all in on trying to get to him.

805
00:52:53,612 --> 00:52:56,073
Trying to talk him around
to like burn the papers.

806
00:52:56,198 --> 00:53:01,037
But she couldn't change his mind,
'cause he's gone bananas.

807
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:05,666
Is she solid?

808
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,755
Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's solid.

809
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:19,096
Okay. Okay. Thank you, Tumbledown.
I'm getting out of this shithole.

810
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:21,932
We should be together.

811
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:46,665
So, uh, Gramps, this...
this isn't the lawyer I was recommended.

812
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:51,379
Pugh's a good man.
He's helping me set my estate in order.

813
00:53:51,754 --> 00:53:53,339
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

814
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:58,761
Just getting a double black eye.
Strong filter with a double espresso shot.

815
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:01,722
Might as well fire up Charles Babbage's
Difference Engine.

816
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:03,641
All right. Nice.

817
00:54:03,891 --> 00:54:06,394
- America is always right.
- Never left.

818
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:13,567
I think you're gonna like Pugh.
He's incredibly intransigent.

819
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:17,321
Right. Good. Good. Yeah.

820
00:54:19,573 --> 00:54:24,620
Okay. Uh, can I... do you mind if I just...

821
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:27,331
you probably have a...
do you have a system?

822
00:54:27,456 --> 00:54:30,251
- No, this is it. Right here is good.
- Okay.

823
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:37,675
So, priority one, your wellbeing
and the satisfactory outcome.

824
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,386
Good. Okay. Yes, yes, yes.

825
00:54:40,594 --> 00:54:45,516
Priority two, expose the structural
contradictions of capitalism

826
00:54:45,641 --> 00:54:48,853
as reified in the architecture
of corporate America.

827
00:54:50,563 --> 00:54:51,939
Good. Also good.

828
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:54,400
You're our little wedge, Greg.

829
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:59,655
A nice little wedge to open up the hood
and have a poke around in at Waystar.

830
00:55:00,156 --> 00:55:04,368
Okay. Good. I... I guess...

831
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:09,039
I'm quite focused on like my position

832
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:16,338
and me in particular not getting fired
or going to jail, if that isn't too selfish.

833
00:55:16,464 --> 00:55:19,508
Eyes on the prize, Greg.
Eyes on the prize.

834
00:55:21,177 --> 00:55:24,472
Good. I like it. I like it.

835
00:55:51,373 --> 00:55:52,917
- Which one is Shiv?
- That black one right there.

836
00:55:53,042 --> 00:55:55,002
This one? Thanks.

837
00:55:55,628 --> 00:55:57,004
Hi.

838
00:55:58,255 --> 00:56:00,299
- Well done, Gerri.
- Thank you.

839
00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:01,402
- Good to see you, Pinky.
- Yeah, it's good to have you back, Dad.

840
00:57:03,195 --> 00:57:05,781
A hug would have been nice.

841
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:10,869
Uh, thanks for the doughnuts.

842
00:57:11,912 --> 00:57:15,040
You know, and I think they got enough shots
of me through the window, so...

843
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:19,962
No, no, no. Not shots.
For the hug.

844
00:57:22,965 --> 00:57:25,551
Oh, yeah. Sure. Captain Cuddles.

845
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:32,391
So I wanna get you in
before the shareholder meet.

846
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:35,519
High level. President.

847
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:44,612
- What does it mean?
- It means whatever you want it to mean.

848
00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:50,034
- Okay. So, made-up?
- Someone at the top with credibility.

849
00:57:52,494 --> 00:57:57,875
- A mascot?
- My eyes and ears, Shiv.

850
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:00,669
At the heart of everything through
this shitstorm,

851
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:08,886
but wearing a full chemical and biological
suit going by the name of Gerri Kellman.

852
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,615
- Hey, Ken.
- Heavy infantry.

853
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,492
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

854
00:58:31,659 --> 00:58:35,037
Winning this case,
what this is gonna do for the world.

855
