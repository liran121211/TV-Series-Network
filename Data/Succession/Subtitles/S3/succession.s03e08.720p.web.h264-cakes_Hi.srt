00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,711
Maybe...

343
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,296
-keep tabs on that one, okay?
-COMFREY PELLITS: Okay.

344
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,257
Fucking bottom feeders.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

345
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,093
Um... So unless it's weird,
I might fuck off?

346
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,261
Yeah. Whatever.

347
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,804
-Clock the fuck off.
-COMFREY: Okay.

348
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,686
-COMFREY: Hey.
-Hey!

349
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,063
Okay!

00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,028
I'm great--

353
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,821
Oh, shit.

354
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,322
-Phone stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah. Sorry.

355
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,782
No, no, uh, go for it.

356
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,413
(GIGGLES)

357
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,457
-Thank you.
-Well, congratulations, Greg.

358
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,542
Yeah. Punching above
your weight?

359
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,003
-Oh, Comfry?
-Mm-hmm.

360
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,129
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,798
Yeah, I like her, I like her.

362
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,342
I do wonder...

363
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,470
-SHIV: Can you hold this?
-...is there depth there?

364
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,556
-TOM: Sure.
-Like, is-- I don't--
is there substance?

365
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,974
Depth?

366
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,809
Oh my God!

367
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,102
The man dying of thirst

368
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,521
is suddenly
a mineral water critic?

369
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,608
Does Comfry not sate
your lust for wisdom, Greg?

370
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,651
It's such a shame Sontag's
not still alive.

371
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,320
You could take her
to the drive-though.

372
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,530
-(CHUCKLES)
-GREG: Maybe, I wonder,

373
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,159
when she gets to know
the quote-unquote "real me,"

374
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,410
uh, will she stick around?

375
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,537
Well, I guess either way,
if doesn't work out,

376
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,456
she's a great date ladder.

377
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,625
Wh-- Excuse me?
As-- As in?

378
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,169
Well, you know,
people will see her with you.

379
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,213
And no offense, but they'll say,

380
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,673
(CHUCKLES) "What the fuck's
going on there?"

381
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,008
TOM: "Why is he with her?"

382
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,135
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I'm aware
of what you're saying.

383
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,221
-TOM: Okay.
-SHIV: It still could work
for you.

384
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,973
Date ladder!
Play the date ladder game!

385
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,851
What-- What about her?

386
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,102
-She looks nice.
-SHIV: Well, yeah.

387
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,270
TOM: Hmm. Yeah.

388
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,439
-SHIV: (CHUCKLES)
-I mean, yeah, why not?

389
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,816
-She's pretty.
-She is very pretty.

390
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,109
She's also a princess
or a duchess or something.

391
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,444
-Yeah.
-But sure. Yeah.

392
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,821
-Why-- Why not?
-Why not?

393
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,988
We put a man on the moon.

-GREG: Oh...
-TOM: Oh...

397
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,579
-GREG: Okay.
-SHIV: Okay. Wow.

398
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,248
Poor woman, she probably...

(CHUCKLES)

400
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,209
She thinks she met
a fun guy at a wedding.

401
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,795
He should be colored red
like a dangerous lizard.

402
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,464
Oh, no. Scary Poppins
is on maneuvers.

403
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,549
Can you, no, just--

404
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,967
-just block me from her?
-TOM: Blocking you.

405
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,844
SHIV: You know, she knows
that I'm not in a good place

406
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,220
and then it's all... (INHALES)

How is your marriage going?

00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,830
It's off the radar and now this?
Is it-- Is this a move?

420
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,207
It, um, could be...

421
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,542
It could be nothing, you know?

422
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,085
Fucking social media fireworks!

GERRI: Is he trying
to boost his price?

425
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,673
SHIV: Is he just
rocking the boat

426
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,508
or trying to blow up the deal?
I mean, has he got good

You're supposed to be
inside this, Rome.

I am inside this. Leave it.

-Yeah.

866
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,066
You know, and Matsson's
got Dad spooked,

867
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,401
so I'm gonna have to find him
a better deal, a bigger one.

868
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,528
I'm gonna do it, and I'm gonna

when you-- when you said,

(CLEARS THROAT)
"Say something filthy"

968

Yeah. I was just being horrible

No, it was--
it was dirty, but...

I feel a little, um...

00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,722
I was thinking...

976
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,224
more like love beads,
or, you know,

977
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,477
-I'd be a sexy fireman, and...
-Oh.

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,812

of that you don't love me.

Right, right, yeah.

982
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,488
No, I know, but then
sometimes I think, um...

983
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,282
sometimes I think,
"Should I maybe listen

984
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,035
to the things you say

Yes.

Yeah, I...

995
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,434
Yeah, I think so.

996
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,644
One way or another.

997
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:51,063
You know,
we should freeze at least.

-Yeah?
-Yeah.

999
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,945
You know, embryos survive
way better than eggs. So...

1000
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,280
we should...

1001
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,450
put it together
and then see where we are.

1002
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:11,500
Okay. And-- And when do you--
when do you think that might be?

1003
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,253
Well, I don't... (SIGHS)

1004
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,796
(CHUCKLING) ...know, Tom. It--

1005
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,840
It's important
that the-- the-- the--

1006
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,633

you know, you can do what...
(INHALES) ...you want,

1010
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,142
but it-- it-- it--
it's different if one of us dies

1011
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,643
or is in a long-term coma.

1012
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,311

-And-- No, it's-- That's what--

1013
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,730
It's true, you d--
you decide beforehand

1014
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,773
what you would want
to happen, and...

1015
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,233
You know, I don't just
automatically get them

1016
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,193
if we divorce... (CHUCKLING)
...or something like that,

1017
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,988
if that's the thing
that concerns you.

1018
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,281
No, I just-- I wo--

1019
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,700
I wouldn't have necessarily
thought about all of that.

1020
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,620
Oh. Uh-- Well,
I just think it's smart

1021
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,664
-to bank some embryos.
-Uh-huh.

1022
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,207
And then, you know,
we can see where we are.

1023
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,877
So we could be looking at,
like, ten years?

-That's-- That's like--
-Oh, well...

1025
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,047
Ten years is like
