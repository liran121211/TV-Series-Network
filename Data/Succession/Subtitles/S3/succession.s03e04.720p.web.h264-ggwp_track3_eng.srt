that I'm gonna go over

25
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,333

00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:08,250
and rough-jacks there
to administer a beating.

27
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,708

turn you against me.

-And that's fine.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,666

gonna turn against me.

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,125
No, no, no. No!

32
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,583
-No way!
-Are you gonna turn against me?

00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,791

Yeah, the temperature of the DOJ
investigation, the raid here,

80
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,875
it's caused serious
blowback from investors.

81
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,583

His fingers on

90
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,708
We've talked to him
about what we can do

91
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,208
and he's playing hard to get.

92
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,500
But...

93
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:13,708
he was interested in time in
the room with you and your dad.

94
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,833
Together?

95
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,291
No.

96
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, his thing was, I guess,
to know how this goes.

97
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,000
He wants his
pound of flesh, all right?

98
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,875
GERRI:<i> Uh, Kendall,</i>
<i>he just wants to make sure</i>

99
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,166
<i>that the family business</i>
<i>can still function.</i>

100
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,166
Yeah, well, obviously,
I can't meet jointly with Dad.

101
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,583
It's just a half hour
in a lawyer's office later.

102
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,750
Kendall, we are four days out
from the shareholder meeting.

103
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,041
KARL MULLER:<i> Kendall, it's about</i>
<i>control of the company,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

104
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,250
The vote is on a razor's edge.

105
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,958
We need his four percent.

106
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,125
Unless you think that any of us
would have a bright future

107
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,833
<i>with Sandy and Stewy</i>
<i>in control of the firm.</i>

108
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,541
So, um, he's suggesting
in four hours...

109
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,083
No, no, no. No!
You don't railroad me. No.

110
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,625
I need to run this by my team.

111
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,833
Me and Dad together,
the optics are janky as fuck.

112
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,708
Come! Behave appropriately!

114
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,875

not behaved appropriately?

00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,083
Well, I'm hearing that the raid
was just a warning shot.

122
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,708
So, things should
settle down now.

123
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,458
I think I need more people.

124
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,250

125
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,625
Dad, you have
two former Deputy AG's

126
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,416
and the ex-head of Fraud
at Main Justice.

127
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,083
These are
the Harlem Globetrotters,

128

the Westchester Judge-fuckers.

129
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,333
The Raisin owes me everything.

130
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,583
And now I need
a bit of fucking cover,

131
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,375
the forgetful cunt's gone AWOL.

132
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,000
I think perhaps, we have been
insufficiently rigorous,

133
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,083
journalistically,
on the President.

134
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,500
You think he'll respond well
to a little bit of pressure?

135
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, every time I call
Michelle-Anne, she tells me,

136
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,166
"Be patient!

137
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,375
The cavalry is coming!"

138
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,250
I need leverage.

139
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,916
I have Connor, again.

140
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,000
See? See?

141
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,250
I'm in a corner.

142
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,500
Everyone wants a piece.

143
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,666
Everyone's out of their box.
Everything's coming up fuck.

144
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,750
I want you on fire-watch, okay?

145
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,458
Yeah, okay, Dad. Absolutely.

146
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,833
And, uh, watch the negotiations.

147
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:31,000
Karl's a smart bastard
but, uh, he likes to be liked.

148
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,166
-Not good.
-Got it.

149
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,375
Okay, so can we strategize?
I got potential gold here.

150
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,208
But I need your read
on how to deploy.

151
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,750
Roman, could you please
put your footwear on?

152
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,375
Uh, see, for this to work,
we need, you know, boundaries.

153
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,708
-And--
-What, I can't take
my footwear off?

154
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,041
Well, it's just--

155
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,583
What, I can't masturbate in
a time and place of my choosing?

156
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,875
-See that?
-You are building...

157
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,041
-That will kill us.
-...a police state here, Gerri.

158
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,208
I found tattoo man.

159
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,625
-"Tattoo man"?
-ROMAN ROY: Yup.

160
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,916
Funny little story.
So, about fifteen-ish years ago,

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,333
Kendall's bachelor party
in New Orleans,

162
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,833
we did this, like...

163
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,166
ironic bar crawl thing
on Bourbon Street.

164
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,166
And we got chatting
with this, you know,

165
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,750
friendly hobo.

166
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,583
And there was talk of,
you know, various...

167
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,625
disgusting endeavors
like, you know,

168
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,708
"Would the hobo eat
a deep-fried deck shoe?"

169
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,083
(FAKE LAUGHS) You know, stupid,
whatever, bullshit.

170
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,166
Before we settled on a rather...

171
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,250
indecent proposal
which was to...

172
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,125
get the homeless man to have

173
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,750
Kendall's name tattooed
on his forehead.

174
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,916
What?

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,916
Yeah, we got Kendall's initials
tattooed on a rando.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,416
And you think this is
a good idea to dredge this up?

177
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
On Kendall? Woke-ahontas?

178
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,958
Using a poor's forehead
as a Post-It?

179
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,583
It's fucking killer,
are you kidding me?

180
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,041
Well, I'm not so sure.

181
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,791
Okay, well, we can talk about it
over lunch, maybe?

182
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,291
Uh, not today, Roman,
I have a date.

183
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,583
Fuck off! With who?
Montgomery Clift?

184
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,416
-The Ghost of Christmas Past?
-GERRI: Laurie.

185
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,750
-Who?
-Laurie.

186
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,166
He's ex-DOJ.

187
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,833
He worked
the Arthur Anderson prosecution.

188
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,958
I want to see if there's
a back channel there.

189
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,125
ROMAN: Laurie?

190
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,625
And you said he wants to

191
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,458
back-channel you
in the parking lot or--

192
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,375
Yeah, so, the thing is,
I'm dating.

193
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,291
I am dating
and that needs to be understood.

194
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,791
Okay, I get it. Yeah, yeah.

195
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,583
You're drawing a line.

196
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,250
Or otherwise, you know...

197
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,958
Laurie will knock my
jolly old block off.

198
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,250
If he can...

199
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:27,625
find his sword stick and fire up
his motorized bath chair.

200
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,625
All right.

201
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,750
GREG: Good morning!

202
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,291
LOGAN: Ah!

203
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,333
Greg.

204
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,333
Drink.

205
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,083
-Uh, alcohol?
-Uh-huh.

206
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,208
Um...

207
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,625
sure, I--

208
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,000
It's early but I--

209
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:56,208
Yeah, I think I'll actually have
me a nice glass of rum and coke.

210
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,125
Kerry!

211
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,166
Can we bring, uh, Greg
some Coca-Cola?

212
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,333
No, it's fine really.

213
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,333
-Uh, she doesn't have to--
-LOGAN: No, no, no.

214
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,958
What Greg wants... (EXHALES)
...Greg must have.

215
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:13,291
Thank you. Like, so kind.
Ridicu-- I don't know.

216
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,458
Uh...

217
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,625
You and Kendall
have been hanging around a lot.

218
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,750
Correct?

219
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,416
I am, um...

220
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,458
It's purely social, you know.

221
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,625
The thing is
your position at Waystar...

222
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:31,000
could become complicated if you
get too associated with him.

223
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,416
Hmm?

224
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,541
-You can see that?
-(GROANS)

225
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,708
Strong. Wow.

226
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,625
Nice and strong. Strong one.

227
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:39,916
Strong for a man.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,541
The FBI, as you know, have been
poking around our offices.

229
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,958
Greg...

230
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,041
you've probably never
done this before.

231
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:53,666
And we're all,
all very, very concerned.

232
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,583
I don't want to see you hurt.

233
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,208
We need our lawyers
all working together.

234
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,166
One big happy family.

235
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,708
Joint Defense Agreement.

236
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,541
Big strong umbrella.

237
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,375
Keeps you dry.

238
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,541
That-- it's interesting.
It's very interesting.

239
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:13,000
I think I would have to
speak to my lawyer, uh, Pugh,

240
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,583
who is often unavailable
during daytime.

241
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,083
We have the paperwork
ready for you to sign.

242
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:21,916
Right.

243
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,750
So, okay, I guess...

244
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,625
um...

245
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,875
my question would be...

246
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,541
what's it worth?

247
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,875
In terms of the "me" of it all?

248
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,583
What do you want?

249
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,208
GREG: What do I want?

250
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,416
I mean...

251
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,583
What can I get?

252
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,958
That's not the way it works.

253
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,541
Well, maybe it is.

254
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,500

258
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,875
Just a little.

259
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,791
So, why don't you fuck off

260
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,916
and think about what you wanna
ask for to come on side

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,958
and I'll see what I can do.

262
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,041
Okay?

263
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,916

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,625

265
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,458

I don't know how you did it
back in the 60s.

274
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,958
Different times.
Different times indeed.

275
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,833
Better times?

276
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,833

Well, Josh Aaronson
is a lock for me.

288

He's always been
a lock right back.

289

he says to people.

<i>to do this. You know it is.</i>

291
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,500
It's smart for now because you
can't have Sandy and Stewy win.

292
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,625
Right?
That just nukes everything.

293
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,041
Yeah, but they'll settle...

in the end, right?

295
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,708
But also it's smart for tomorrow
because it would be fun if,

296
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,125
if... your dad has to step away,

297

you get to show Aaronson
who you are.

298
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,375
When and where?

299
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,833

00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,958
It's all last minute.
Josh's daughter is sick,

you go out to his island.

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,750

00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,083

-Hey, Dad.

-Grab a seat.
-Hmm.

Sorry for all this.

Look, I know
you're pressed for time.

525
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:37,375
I just wanted to, uh, check in.

526
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:41,416
As an investor,
but, uh, you know, also as a...

527
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,958
as a friend.

528
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:47,166
You know, I guess
I have concerns.

529
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,333
Let me tell you, hand on heart.

530
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,833
Whatever the turbulence
in the short term,

531
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:55,333
there is nothing
that's a significant issue.

532
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,000
The core business
is the core business

533
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,958
and the volatility
is priced in now.

534
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,833
So, it's all upside from here.

back me, sit tight,

in your castle here,

537
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,541
and I'll make you whole.

538
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,541
Okay?

539
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:20,375
No, it doesn't work like that.
Can we take a walk?

540
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:23,750
(CHUCKLES) Look at
this fucking New York wiseacre.

541
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:24,958
No, seriously, come on.

542
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:27,458
It's so beautiful,
it's disgusting. I mean...

543
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:28,833
A walk?

544
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:30,416
-JOSH: Yeah.
-How far?

545
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:32,750
Come on, Dad. Let's walk it out.

546
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,208
JOSH: Yeah?

547
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:38,333
Shall I send the cart for you,
or shall we walk?

548
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,416
Sure! Let's walk.

Good to...

It's good to catch up, um...

-Hugo, do you wanna?
-Yes.

had something there.

photos of it from around then?

We'd arrange payment
if you had any photos.

Yeah, I'm not super proud
of what I did.

598

any photos of it out there.

Right, that makes sense.
And not wishing to...

600
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:10,208
uh, make this too
transactional, but...

601
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,208

to get it back.

you know, start hands on.

already gamed it.

living in a magical castle.

down in a dungeon

know about, um...

-TOM: Greg, yeah.

705
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:08,458
Sporus was a young slave boy.

706
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:10,916
He was Nero's favorite.

707
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And, uh...

708
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,583
you know what Nero did to him?

709
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,333
"Nero and Sporus". I don't--

Well, Nero...

712
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:21,708
pushed his wife...

713
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,291
down the stairs.

714
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:29,333
And then he had Sporus castrated
and he married him instead.

715
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:30,958
And he gave him a ring.

716
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:33,458
And he made him dress up
like his dead wife.

into the prison blogs again.

from fruit and ketchup

the wine back as it ferments.

to burp the toilet wine?"

868
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:07,750
But the truth is
I'm not gonna get wine

869
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:10,208
of any temperature
in prison, Shiv.

870
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:12,083
There are no
fine wines in prison.

871
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,791
You don't get to
choose what you eat.

872
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,166
You don't get to
say what you do.

873
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,125
You know, like, like...

874
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:21,250
What-- How late can I read?
When is "lights out"?

875
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,833
I'm fucking--
I'm fucking terrified, Shiv.

876
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,416
Hey!

877
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,625
Hey, it's--

878
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:31,500
I mean, uh--

879
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,916
I don't know
what I can say to you.

880
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,000
(PHONE BUZZES)

881
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh.

882
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:42,958
Yeah, I gotta--

883
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,125
It's Dad.

884
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,750
No. Sure, sure, sure, sure.

885
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,500
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

886
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,208
-SHIV: Sorry, honey. I--
-No. No, no.

887
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,791
-Hey, Dad.
-I've just spoken to Karl.

888
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:57,041
Uh, Greg's in by the way.
Tom got him to sign.

889
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,666
Karl's not happy
with your level of input.

890
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,583
Oh? (CHUCKLES)
Okay. Well, fuck him, right?

891
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:05,750
I don't need another toothache.

892
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:09,125
Well, you okayed me to
go in there and kick some ass.

893
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:12,125
-And I barely--
-I gave you a destination.

894
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,750
I can't walk you there, okay?

895
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:17,583
Okay, Dad,
but if you give in to Karl,

896
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,625
then everyone starts
to carve me out.

897
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,958
There's a line.

898
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,166
<i>-And--</i>
-Nothing is a line.

899
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,833
Everything everywhere
is always moving forever.

900
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:28,875
Get used to it.

901
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,250
Okay.

902
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,583
LOGAN: So, Josh...

903
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,791
where are we on this?

904
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,666
You know, I have a wife at home.
(LAUGHS)

905
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:50,083
Uh, thank you.

906
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:51,583
Uh...

907
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:53,208
Well, uh...

908
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,416
help yourself.

909
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,166
Uh, I hear you
on the fundamentals.

910
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,000
You know.

911
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,208
I mean, fuck Sandy and Stewy.

912
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,125
That's just
financial engineering and...

913
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,250
I can do that myself, right?

914
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:11,708
Yeah, absolutely.

915
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:12,916
But this...

916
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,333
this still feels off.

917
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:15,791
I mean, Ken, it feels like...

918
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,708
I mean, you want your dad
to go to jail?

919
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:23,416
Well, uh,
that's not for me to say.

920
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,791
JOSH: I mean,
it kind of is, though.

921
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:28,000
Like if you were a judge,
you'd want him to go to prison?

922
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,333
I believe the traditional
whistleblowing process

923
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,666
would be subverted.

924
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,250
-So, that's why I--
-JOSH: Uh, but Logan,

925
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:34,833
the reputational hit?

926
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,500
I mean, optically,

927
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:37,791
maybe you become...

928
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,666
a punchline.

929
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,708
One of those big guys
who aren't coming back.

930
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,250
When is this gonna end?

931
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,333
I'm hearing separate planes.

932
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:47,583
I gotta say...

933
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:49,916
I don't like betting
on blood feuds.

934
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,875
It ends with me in control...

935
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:54,791
slapped wrists,

936
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:56,500
and a payout.

937
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:58,666
That stuff...

938
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,625
sea mist.

939
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,833
Vapor.

940
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:04,125
JOSH: Here's the disconnect.

941
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,541
See, I think that...

942
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,416
end of the day...

943
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,666
you work for the shareholders.

944
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,166
For me.

945
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:20,041
But I think that you think

946
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:23,666
that I'm some dipshit who had
a lucky night at the casino,

947
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,000
who acts all fancy,

948
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:28,000
and then makes you eat fucking
rodents for my pleasure.

949
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,125
Right?

950
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,458
But I have a gun at your head.

951
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,791
And I need to know if this is
gonna be a functional situation.

952
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:40,041
And I'm sure you're gonna say,

953
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,208
"Yes, it is going to be
a functional situation."

954
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:43,583
But I'm gonna need
to hear you say

955
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:45,125
that it's
a functional situation.

956
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:47,833
So, can you work together?

957
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,750
-Uh-huh.
-Sure. Absolutely.

958
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,416
(LAUGHS)

959
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,083
Oh, fuck. This is tough.

960
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:01,208
This is-- It's fucking tough,
I gotta say. 'Cause...

961
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,833
I don't really believe you.
I mean, I kinda don't.

962
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,500
It'll be okay.

963
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:15,541
It'll be okay...

964
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,083
because he's a good kid.

965
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,708
-He's a good kid?
-LOGAN: Yeah.

966
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:21,666
He's a good kid.

967
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,500
(CHUCKLES)

968
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,833
-Okay.
-LOGAN: Yeah.

969
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,791
He did what he thought was best.

970
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:31,208
I think he went too far, but...

971
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,083
he's a good kid.

972
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:35,666
Yeah?

973
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,083
He's a good kid...

974
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:40,125
and I love him.

975
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:42,791
LOGAN: I mean...

976
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:44,958
there'll be a big number.

977
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:48,458
We'll pay, he'll mew and cry
and-- and I'll get it.

978
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,500
It'll all be okay.

979
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:52,166
And...

980
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,375
maybe...

981
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:56,583
it'll be him one day.

982
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,916
It's in his blood.

983
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,250
He learned it all from me.

984
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,208
And maybe...

985
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:07,833
maybe he's the best one
of all of them.

986
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:09,958
So, yeah...

987
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:11,958
it'll be okay.

988
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,250
Wow!

989
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:17,833
Well...

990
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:21,125
So, that's nice to hear?

991
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,625

for me to come your way,
I have a little wish list.

1001
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:47,416
I'd consider that. Absolutely.

we get back a little easier.

You're high and dry.

1047
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,083
Face it, son.

1048
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:53,916
You lost.

1049
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:56,625
You guys good to keep going?

1050
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:00,166
'Cause, uh, I have visitors
coming and, um...

1051
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,125
You sure you're okay?
'Cause I'm gonna run ahead.

1052
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,625
-You go! You go! I'm great.
-I could send a cart.

1053
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:06,625
Okay.

00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,083
Hey, Josh!

1056
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:33,250
Uh, I think this feels like
it's going to the ocean.

1057
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:34,750
No, no, this is the short way.

1058
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:36,833
Uh, anyway, I know where we are.

1059
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,208
Yeah.

1060
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,166
Stop staring. I'm fine.

1061
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,583
Hey, it's pretty rough, though.

1062
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,166
So, you wanna wait for the cart?

1063
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,333
I mean, there's a lot of bumps.

1064
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:48,708
Oh, bumps! (LAUGHS)
I've walked bumps!

1065
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:50,791
You sure? I don't mind calling.

Not on my account.

-Yeah.

I'm gonna run up ahead.

you need a breather?

1075

I'm fine.

1076
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:19,458
Right.

1077
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,833
You've lied so much you
don't even fucking know anymore.

1078
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:24,041
Your brain's scrambled egg,
look at you.

1079
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:26,625
-I beat you. Pipe down!
-What's that? I can't hear you.

1080
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:28,375
You're fucked.

1081
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:30,333
Uh-huh, look at you.
You're 600 years old

1082
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:32,000
and you've pissed off
your fucking boyfriend,

1083
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:34,041
the President,
and he's sending the Feds on you

1084
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:36,083
and you're wriggling,
but you're in too deep.

1085

Everyone knows.

1086
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:38,500
And now you're trying to counter

1087
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,291
but you've put Shiv in there
and she's a fucking dipshit.

1088
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,375
I hear no one respects her.
Everyone's digging her out.

1089
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:44,916
And you're losing control,
and everyone hates you.

1090

Let's just close
the deal with Josh.

1091

Mark only discusses editorial

I have a line for you
on the President

1170
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:37,833
that we'd like you to
start rolling out immediately.

1171
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:39,666
We're open to suggestions,
but, uh,

1172
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,000
we just feel like
our general ideological sympathy

1173
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:46,250
has maybe let them off the hook
on too many specifics.

1174
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:48,291
Right? Like big tech.

1175
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:49,625
Middle East.

1176
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:50,833
Green subsidies.

1177
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:54,250
We'd like a branded
nightly segment, like...

1178
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:59,416
"Is he losing his grip?"

1179
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:03,083
You know he's a friend, right?

1180
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:06,041
But with a question mark, like,
"Is he?"

1181
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,166
Oh! Oh, with a question mark!

1182
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,083

discretion on the punctuation.

Okay?

1185
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:17,250
And a reputation that I've
built up over a number of years.

1186
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:19,250
But this is something
my dad wants.

1187
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:23,250
So, one, he has a great antenna

1188
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:24,833
and you should
trust his hunches.

1189
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:26,000
But two...

1190
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:29,083
in a sense, this conversation
is already over.

1191
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,375
It's just a question of
how many times

1192
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:31,833
we scream the word
"Fuck" at each other

1193
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:33,291
before you do what we want.

1194
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,791
What if I go public with this
full-court press?

1195
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,625

00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,541
Yeah, but...

1197
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:45,958
the thing about us, Mark,
and you should know this by now,

1198
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:48,250
we don't get embarrassed.

1199
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:51,333

00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,833

or tug him off between courses?

1205
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:09,208

stop flirting with me.

my bedtime bath.

1215
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,166
Bank the photos. By all means.
But don't spread it around.

1216
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,750
Yeah, it's great for Logan.

1217
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,166
It's bad for Kendall.

1218
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,625
It's bad for you.

1219
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,083
"The Tattoo Brothers"?

1220
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:41,750
Oh, okay, so, what?
You, uh-- you care?

1221
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:44,333
"How does this advance
my personal position?"

1222
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:47,375
You need to
think about that 24/7.

1223
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:49,416
You should get that
tattooed on your head.

1224
00:55:49,958 --> 00:55:51,416
Here.

1225
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,375
Keep the photos.
Our little secret.

1226
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:57,833
Oh, did you hear about your dad?

1227
00:55:57,916 --> 00:55:58,916
No, what?

1228
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:02,208
LOGAN: Uh-huh. I'm sorry.

1229
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:04,791
I don't control them like that.

1230
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:09,000
-He has editorial freedom.

Oh, come on, come on!
That's just rumors.

1232
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,041
Watch the show!

1233
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,541
I'm sure it won't seem so bad.

1235
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:23,125
You want to hear
what it sounds like

1236
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:25,083
when the President
loses his temper?

(CHUCKLES)

1239
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,000
Look, let me investigate.
I--

1240
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:37,166
You know Mark.

1241
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:40,708
He's very tenacious,
very independent.

1242
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:42,750
I don't know,
but if I wasn't so tied up

1243
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,541
in this fucking investigation,

1244
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:49,041
I could focus on keeping
ATN on message. Hmm?

1245
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:54,375
ROMAN: Hey, I hear
you tried to kill Dad again?

1246
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:55,875
It was just heat exhaustion.

1247
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:57,333
Uh, that's not
what we're hearing.

1248
00:56:57,416 --> 00:56:59,708
We're hearing that you took an
old man out to die in the sun.

1249
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,541
We went for a hike with Josh.

1250
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,416
You tried to assassinate
our dad with the sun.

1251
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
Do you have a fetish
for nearly killing Dad?

1252
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:08,875
Like, "Just the tip"
but for like killing Dad?

1253
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,750
Well, look, it's in hand.

1254
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:11,833
The vote.

1255
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:12,916
Josh is a lock.

1256
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,625
Uh, well, no, actually.
He's out.

1257
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:15,708
What are you talking about?

1258
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:18,166
-He's with us.
-ROMAN:<i> No! He's out.</i>

1259
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,416
Frank just got off the phone.

1260
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,541
Apparently, Dad's little
freak-out gave him the shits.

1261
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:23,541
<i>Weak leadership,</i>
<i>fractured at the top.</i>

1262
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:26,083
You let him fucking shrivel,
he saw that.

1263
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:27,125
And now he has, quote,

1264
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,291
"Zero faith in the
post-Dad leadership."

1265
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:30,458
It's not my fault
he's an old man

1266
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:31,708
who can't climb a fucking hill.

1267
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:33,291
We're about to lose the company
at the shareholder meet,

1268
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:37,125
all because you wouldn't give
our dad a timely fucking Evian.

1269
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:38,416
Good day!
