we'd like to move on

00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,725
to the matter
of these illegal payments.

is how these illegal payments
were made, were approved,

-Yup. Got it.

about who you might

-SHIV: Yeah, and I love him,

but he fucked the phone call
with the Raisin,

153

that's an existential risk,

154
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,229
and the only solid thing
he actioned in LA, Dad,

155
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,647

176
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,306
Well, wait
till the weekend's over.

177
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,351
We'll get our white
cis male stank all over you.

PETE: It's just such a thrill.
(CHUCKLES)

179
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,106
I'm probably the biggest
Con-head in Oklahoma.

180
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,441
Of course! Panhandle Pete!

181
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,278
You've met Maxim Pierce?
He's my intellectual heft.

00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,117
I push him, he pushes me,
and around and around we go!

185
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,869
Is it just me, or in a room
full of Timothy McVeighs,

186
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,871
does Connor suddenly
look like a Roosevelt?

187
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:41,872
-Sweetie.
-(GRUNTS)

188
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,124
It's Panhandle Pete!

189
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,961
Frowny Face here
wanted to stay home

190
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,170
and work on her play,

191
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,214
but duty calls
for my leggy Mary Todd.

192
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,844
Mm. No, it's fine. I can totally
just write the play on my phone.

193
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,430
So, uh, how did you two meet?

194
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,682
BOTH: Online.

RON PETKUS: (OVER SPEAKERS)
Hi, folks. Just for a second.

197
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,145
Quiet for just a second.

198
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:07,982
I want to thank you all for...

199
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,734
being here on such short notice

200
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,068
and I want to thank you

201
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,612
for keeping
your attendance private.

202
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,157
Uh... What we do here...

203
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,700
at the Future Freedom Summit

204
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,830
is of the utmost importance
to our party and our country.

205
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,081
I-- I happen to believe

206
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,710
the next president
of the United States

207
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,421
is somewhere in this very room.

208
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,882
-He is, and he's hard as a rock.
-PETKUS: So...

209
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,218
may God shepherd...
(CHUCKLES) ...this person.

210
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,262
The health of our republic
depends on it.

211
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,889
GUEST: And the health
of my portfolio.

212

To the republic!

Um... Some guy with an undercut
just called me "soy boy."

Oh, don't worry, Greg.

222
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,034
It's a nice safe space

223
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,119
where you don't have to pretend
to like Hamilton.

224
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,996
Well, I like Hamilton.

225
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,581
Sure, you do. We all do.

226
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,462

what is this, actually, here?

ROMAN: This is just
a nice political conference

228
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,258
of like-minded donors
and intellectuals.

00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,929
-AKA picking the next president.

That's not--
That's not really how it works.

Yeah, no, sure, but yeah.

233
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,895

like, constitutional?

(CLICKS TONGUE)
Oh, I don't know, Greg.

235
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,398
You wanna call a referee?

236
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,899
Is there an ombudsman
in the house?

237
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,068
-Well. Here they are.
-GREG HIRSCH: What is
an ombudsman?

238
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,612
The family who lost us
a presidency.

(SMACKS LIPS) How is he?
The Raisin.

240
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,075
He's out of a job in six months,

241
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,786
lame in the interim,
and the GOP is in flames.

242
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,162
We're all doing backflips.

He's got a serious condition.

needed to know.

-MICHELLE-ANNE: Oh.
-So, uh, what are you hearing?

Well, with the president out,
we need a nominee.

-So welcome to Clown Town.

Six months to election day
and no candidate.

Super Tuesday's gone,
ballots are already finalized.

251
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,182
The delegates will choose
at the RNC, of course, but...

252
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,517
I think we can all be real

253
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,727
and say we need
to choose here first.

254
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,355
It's Boyer, right?
We're going Boyer?

255
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,234
Yup. Cleanest option
is the vice president.

256

The party needs to be united.

this mess,

much during the debates,

I'm pretty anxious. Um...

You can't threaten me.

No, Tom, I was just
thinking about advice.

330
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,860
Because I'm...

00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:07,531
(WHISPERS) I'm obsessing
over the "prison" of it all.

how to stop thinking.

-Yeah.
-It's just constant.

334

I tried that. Doesn't work.

335
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:19,209
No, what I'm preferring
is to always think about it.

336
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,046
And then, when you don't,
for a moment, it's like,

337
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,883
"Ooh! Someone's loosened
their icy grip on my innards."

338
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,262
Yeah.

339
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,680

00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,678
Get your old man
to make me president.

684
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,931
I'll see to it
that you become CEO,

685
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,933
even if I have
to send your dad to prison.

686
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,269
Wow, that is, uh--
That's very funny.

687
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,646
So, it's decided?

688
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,649
You land this for me,
I send your dad up the river?

689
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,026
Uh... Yeah, I mean, unless...

690
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,236
unless he resigns in a month!

691
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,321
-Clean kill, baby.
-(LAUGHS)

692
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,323
(CLICKS TONGUE, INHALES)
Good stuff.

693
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,824
Okay, very funny!

694
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,913
Look, you want some advice?

695
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,540
Hoard mackerel tins.

696
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,750
I know. Sounds funny, right?
(INHALES DEEPLY)

697
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,336
But you're gonna need them
for bartering.

698
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,255
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

699
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,423
Greg, can you?
Will you keep a note?

700
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,842
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, and the toilet.

701
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,845
Your toilet
is your stair machine,

702
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,557
it's your bench,
it's, uh... your fridge,

703
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,100
it's your...
(CHUCKLES) ...lover,

704
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,769
it's-- it's-- it's your brother,
it's your priest.

705
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:59,274
Oh, and also, most importantly,
it's also your... toilet.

706
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,442
-Okay.
-Right. Right. (LAUGHS)

707
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,570
Yeah, that's-- that--
I mean, that's-- yeah, that's--

708
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,904
So, that's a big part of prison?

709
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:08,741
(CHUCKLES)
It could be a perfect gentleman.

710
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,368
Could also be
a terrible bastard.

711
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,953
Your toilet can be a bastard?

712
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,789
PETKUS: Key is unity.

713
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:17,000
If we land a favorite,
I can pool the big money.

714
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:21,796
But I need to know the messaging
will be there to back me up.

715
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:24,257
I like him,
but a lot of people are asking,

716
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,341
"Is Boyer a fighter?"

717
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,801
LOGAN: I don't care
about the resume

718
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:28,678
or ideological purity

719
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,763
as long as they get it

720
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,640
and they pop.

721
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,142
If you're looking
for someone who gets it,

722
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,685
I got your man.

723
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,438
Connor Roy.
He's got a brand name,

724
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,773
war chest, populist appeal

725
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,109
-and he's a fighter.
-CONNOR: Hey, thanks, Pete.

726
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,361
I believe I speak for my father

727
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,031
when I offer
a firm and robust...

728
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,826
-No comment. (CHUCKLES)
-(LAUGHTER)

729
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,620
Sure.

730
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,457
-I could see Connor.
-Sure, I agree.

731
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,377
The sword has been pulled
from the stone, my liege.

732
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,046
SALGADO:
Look at us, playing nice.

733
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,297
People might think
we liked each other.

734
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,257
No. No, what?
Hey, I'm a conservative.

735
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,675
I like tradition.

736
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,843
I doff my cap

737
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:11,596
to Vice President Boyer's
years of loyal service.

738
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,722
Thank you.

739
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,183
I believe you used to call me
"Martin Van Boring."

740
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,019
Hey! Come on!
No, I still call you that.

741
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,397
Mencken and I may differ
in some areas, but, uh...

742
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,024
we both agree
that this is the party

743
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,692
of the working class now.

744
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,570
-(SHIV SCOFFS)
-BOYER: What? Shiv?

745
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,198
All the riches counties
in America are blue.

746
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,910
The Democrats and Tech
hold all the wealth.

747
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,496
I just think some of us
get so high off owning the libs,

748
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,789
we forget to talk policy.

749
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,874
Yeah, Rick loves to talk policy.

750
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,417
What he does is he memorizes

751
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,878
a National Review issue
from 2012

752
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:45,880
and then,
he recites it back to you.

753
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:48,132
-Cool policy, bro.
-And Jeryd hates to talk policy

754
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,802
because it would mean,
you know, having one.

755
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,303
Sick burn, brosef!

756
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,013
MENCKEN: Oh, no, no, no.
We're kidding. We're kidding.

757
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,683
We like each other. I--
I listen to his speeches...

758
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,226
every night.
They help me drop off.

759
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,645
Maybe it's boring talking
about populist solutions

760
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,021
-for working families.
-Rick, come on!

761
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,856
You jerked off
to Reagan's headshot

762
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,109
for 30 years,
and now you're Tom Joad?

763
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,194
Ugh, God!
It's so fucking boring.

764
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,279
-What's that?
-SHIV: Hmm?

765
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,364
What?

766
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,534
No, I've just-- I've seen
your thing quite a lot.

767
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,160
And that-- What's that?
What's my thing?

768
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,413
YouTube provocateur bullshit.

769
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,580
Aristo-populism.

770
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,666
"Rape is natural.
It's all red pill, baby."

771
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,875
I'm just...

772
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,752
(CHUCKLING)
I'm just so fucking over it.

773
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,129
Have you read Plato?

774
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:28,673
Uh... Yeah.

775
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,216
Remind me. What happens?

776
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,843
Read Plato. Read Plato!

777
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,262
(LAUGHS) Oh, don't want to!
Don't fucking want to.

778
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,848
See, he doesn't actually want
to have a conversation.

779
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,599
-SHIV: Yeah.
-He just wants to yell
loud enough...

780
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,684
-SHIV: Yeah.
-...to get on ATN.

781
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,561
Nah! Fuck ATN!

782
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,982
No, really, ATN is treated
as a bulwark, but it's dead.

783
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,567
It's basically...

784
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,319
a pudding cup at 5:00 p.m.
in the nursing home.

785
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,074
Honestly. Doesn't speak to me.

786
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,577
Doesn't speak to the--
the people that I talk to.

787
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:03,207
It is status quo bedtime stories
to maximize shareholder value.

788
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,460
No disrespect, Logan Roy...

789
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,588
was an icon, but, you know...

790
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,048
he's no longer relevant.

791
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,969
-You recognize this fucker?
-Nope.

792
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:18,556
Fucking jelly-boned, low-T,
pip-pip cheerio fucker!

793
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,308
You told Dad yet?

794
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,976
No. We have to stop
the wedding, though. Right?

795
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,103
What? Stop obsessing
over Mom's new husband.

796
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,938
-Just get over it. Who cares?
-Get over it?

797
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,523
It just fucking happened.

798
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,734
My mother is marrying
some dickhead

799
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,860
crooked-toothed turnip man.

800
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,612
What's wrong is how little
you care about it,

801
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,905
-you frozen bitch.
-Poor Rome!

802
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,031
His dreams of porking Mom

803
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,617
slipping through his little
lubed-up fingers.

804
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:43,372
Hey, so! Come in! Come in!

805
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,791
-Yeah.
-Sit.

806
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,042
Sit.

807
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,752
Is Greg necessary?

808
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,338
Just keep your trap shut.

809
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,924
-Watch.
-All right, thank you, sir.

810
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,510
Minimizing the Greg window.

811
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,678
LOGAN: There's a lot
of chaff flying.

812
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,138
A lot of flapping.

813
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,307
But Ron and me
are going to meet and figure out

814
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,684
how we can pull
for the same name.

815
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,897
We need one voice on this,
or we could fall apart

816
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,399
and hand it to the fuck-fuck
donkey gang.

817
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,776
-(CONNOR CHUCKLES)
-HUGO: Right.

818
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,860
So...

819
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,197
who do we like?

820
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,742
Well, shouldn't we kick it
around a bit?

821
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,910
You know, it feels like
it's poised,

822
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,830
so if you and Petkus
come together and--

823
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,748
and then the other donors
follow, then it's--

824
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,874
Exactly.

825
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,085
We're picking.

826
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,087
We haven't got all night.

827
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,630
I like Connor Roy.

828
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,427
SHIV: Honestly, Dad,
I think you go Dems.

829
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,720
-CONNOR: Wow.
-SHIV: Yeah, I do.

830
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,138
ROMAN: Jesus Christ.

831
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,682
Um, I...

832
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,851
kinda like Mencken, but...

833
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,437
I know he's kind of shitty,
so if it's now, I guess, Boyer,

834
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,023
but can I just say
I don't like Boyer--

835
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,441
-What? What's with the fucking--
-SHIV: Roman.

836
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,193
No disrespect,
but Boyer's yesterday's papers.

837
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,320
The Dems will run on change
and blow him away.

838
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,697
ROMAN: Ooh, Mrs. Politics!

839
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,574
How many big races did you win
as a consultant?

840
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,492
-Four? Three? Did you win two?
-Roman! Boyer is not a winner,

841
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,618
-and we know that.
-One?

842
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,537
Okay, well, then,
should we talk to Mencken,

843
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,956
-see if we can deal?
-The base does like him.

844
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:08,875
Right?

845
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,504
SHIV: Uh...

846
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:18,092
look, can I... say something?
Uh... No.

847
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:22,638
Mencken is an integralist,
nativist fuckhead. He's toxic.

848
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,266
He's "Medicare for all,
abortions for none."

849
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,684
And his idea of diplomacy

850
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,477
is shooting roe deer
with Viktor Orban

851
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,354
and then starting
a trade war with China.

852
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,523
Look, I'm tough. I know that
there's the carnival bark

853
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,233
and then there's
the fucking show, but...

854
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,277
he is outside the American
political tradition.

855
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,779
And I think we have
a responsibility as Waystar...

856
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,489
-ROMAN: (HUMS NATIONAL ANTHEM)
-...to the...

857
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,575
-ROMAN: (CONTINUES HUMMING)
-...American Republic and--

858
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,826
and to the future of--

859
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,411
-Fuck you, Roman!
-Four score years
and whatever...

860
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,121
-SHIV: No, he's talked about--
-...my sister did bring forth

861
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,998
from her bedroom
a cup of milky sputum.

862
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,374
-You done?
-ROMAN: Yeah, done.

863
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,959
He's talked about burning Korans

864
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,336
-and licensing
press credentials.
-Yeah.

865
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,129
He's shifting
the Overton window. (LAUGHS)

866
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,505
SHIV: I'm surprised you know
what that fucking is.

867
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,049
-I do.
-SHIV: He's opening it

868
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,383
-and throwing
union organizers out of it.
-ROMAN: Oh, my God.

869
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,509
Stop Chicken Littling us.

870
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,802
It just makes us
wanna all have a nap.

871
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,929
SHIV: Stop being
a dirty little pixie

872
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,513
whispering swastikas
in Dad's ear.

873
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,307
Boom! There you go again!
So fucking route one!

874
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,975
I'm not saying it's going to be
the full Third Reich,

875
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,352
but I am genuinely concerned

876
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,479
that we could slide into a...
(INHALES) ...into a--

877
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,773
a Russian Berlusconied
Brazilian fuck pile.

878
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,400
You have a trophy husband
and several fur coats.

879
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,027
-I think you're gonna be fine.
-Tom!

880
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,779
Who do you like?

881
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,113
Me? I, uh...

882
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,657
I think Shiv...

883
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,241
Shiv talks a lot of sense.

884
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,618
But I also jibe with Salgado.

885
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,786
Oh, you "jibe" with him?

886
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,287
-Pretty sure that's racist, Tom.
-GREG: May I, uh--

887
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,456
-Sorry, do I get a vote?
-ROMAN: Sure you do, buddy.

888
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,042
You get to vote at the election
with all the other folks.

889
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,418
GREG: (CHUCKLES)
All right, yeah.

890
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,587
Well, I guess, I just feel
like you maybe get a bigger vote

891
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,339
-in here.
-ROMAN: Easy, Castro.

892
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:42,093
Boyer is likely to be flexible
over the DOJ.

893
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,803
Not if he doesn't win,
which he won't.

894
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:47,348
Although, we are hearing rumors
that the case is weakening.

895
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,141
And that no one big...

896
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,019
-is likely to do jail time.
-Great.

897
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,897
HUGO: With the notable exception
of Tom, obviously.

898
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,108
-Sorry, Tom.
-No, please, Hugo. Understood.

899
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,820
Look, if you don't go blue, Dad,
then at least we have to be...

900
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,279
-backing Salgado.
-(SCOFFS AND GROANS)

901
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,489
CONNOR: Señor Dickless.

902
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,324
Captain of the Tampa Bay
Cuckaneers.

903
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,118
Uh... Cyd. Sorry.

904
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,577
-Duty calls.
-SHIV: Look, I don't like him.

905
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,329
He's a neocon
pretending to be a Paleocon,

906
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,331
-but he at least talks base,
and...
-TOM: Hello?

907
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,084
-Tom?
-TOM: Uh-huh?

908
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,669
KENDALL:
Where are you right now?

909
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,587
Uh... Virginia.

910
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,341
KENDALL: No, where are you
in the building?

911
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,219
Shiv, can I just say,

912
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,054
and I know that we have had
our differences,

913
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,599
but I do think you are so brave
for picking the brown man.

914
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,059
I think that we should get
you a medal.

915
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,352
-SHIV: Amazing.
-A special medal,
for white women

916
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,603
-who like brown men.
-Just being a racist now.

917
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,355
"I'm a good girl.
I pretend to care about people

918
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,773
'cause no one cares about me."

919
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,234
Oh, yeah, actually, do you have
something you wanna tell Dad?

920
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:43,154
From Mom? A message that maybe
you could share, Rome?

921
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,282
Uh... Yeah, wow. Fuck you!
Thanks, I do.

922
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,658
I have a message, uh, yeah.

923
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,994
Uh... Mom's getting remarried.

924
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,954
Hmm.

925
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,706
To Bertie Woofter?

926
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,917
Uh... No, to Peter, um...
uh... Pe-- uh-- Munion.

927
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,627
-Peter Munion.
-You're fucking kidding?

928
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,298
The seat sniffer?

929
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,758
(SCOFFS) He's been hanging
around...

930
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,093
-(LAUGHING) ...for forty years.
-Yeah, and, uh, she would--

931
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,012
they would love it, apparently,

932
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,638
if you came
to their big Tuscan wedding.

933
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,433
Ooh! Lah-di-dah! (INHALES)

934
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,518
And they sent you
as messenger boy?

935
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,729
(LAUGHS)

936
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,106
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

937
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,945
-Hey, man.
-TOM: Hey.

938
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,238
Thanks for coming.

939
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,117
SERVER: (CLEARS THROAT) Hey.

940
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,746
So, I will take the, uh,
Griddle Hero special, please.

941
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,123
With double hash browns.
Fully loaded.

942
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,583
And a plain waffle

943
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,044
and a-- and a large cup
of room-temperature water.

944
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,128
Thank you.

945
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,299
Uh...

946
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,009
I might just watch him.

947
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,845
You know that Rasputin would
take a dose of arsenic,

948
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,349
uh, with breakfast each morning
to build up his tolerance?

949
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,769
(INHALES DEEPLY)

950
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,312
Look, so...

951
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,526
I think you know...
I've always liked you, Tom.

952
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,945
Well, I like you too, Kendall.
I mean, I have notes.

953
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,489
-(CHUCKLES)
-Oh, no. I have notes.

954
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,949
I think mine
might be more extensive...

955
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,159
-KENDALL: I don't know. (LAUGHS)
-...than yours. (LAUGHS)

956
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,079
KENDALL: But look. I think
I can get you out of this mess,

957
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,372
where you're going.

958
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,291
TOM: Well, uh...

959
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,001
nothing is certain, so...

960
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,630
KENDALL: You know
they're calling you...

961
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,090
the Christmas tree?

962
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,843
Yeah?

963
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,178
Perhaps that's because
I'm tall and jolly.

964
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,181
KENDALL: Maybe. You think?

965
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,142
But I think maybe you don't want
to be the chip

966
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,519
the company offers up
when it has no choice.

967
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,771
Well...

968
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,650
obviously, I would prefer that
not to happen,

969
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,360
but, um...

970
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,113
-it's complicated.
-KENDALL: It is.

971
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,073
But I'm here to ask,
are you interested

972
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,451
in an alternative,
theoretically?

973
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,663
I have, of late, uh,

974
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:01,167
decided not to tarry
too much with hope.

975
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,335
Okay, well, my case is...

976
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,715
It's strong. It's--
No, it's-- it's...

977
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,718
(SCOFFS) My case is fine.

978
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,970
It has gaps.

979
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,848
But if I had someone
who could say

980
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,809
that nothing gets signed off on
without my dad's say-so,

981
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,227
which I think we both know
to be true...

982
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,270
-Ooh, I--
-...then--

983
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,272
I don't know
that I do know that, Ken.

984
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,233
Uh-huh.

985
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,736
Yeah, I'm just
a humble servant, Ken.

986
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,160
I admire you, man.

987
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,537
I do, I fucking-- You know?

988
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,040
You-- You-- You're-- Look at--
You're a long way from home.

989
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,667
You're far from the tree.

990
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,255
You've played your hand well,

991
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,882
and you're sitting
at the top table.

992
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,593
Well, shucks. Thank you.

993
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,387
I fell in love with your sister.
That's what happened.

994
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,306
Sure. Oh, yeah.
Right, right, right.

995
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,515
Sure. Sure, man.

996
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,560
The country mouse
and the hot tamale.

997
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,645
(CHUCKLES)

998
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,063
And you're just, uh...

999
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,190
what? Just--

1000
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,567
I suppose you're just
a long glass of water.

1001
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,403
-No agenda?
-I guess.

1002
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,198
KENDALL: Well,
here's how it goes.

1003
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,992
I have new lawyers,
who are fucking amazing.

1004
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,911
I do not underestimate

1005
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:21,372
the cognitive dissonance
you're experiencing.

1006
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,250
Lying, hiding.

1007
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,834
But pretty soon,

1008
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,211
granted immunity.

1009
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,755
And you're not going to prison.

1010
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,258
How does that sound?

1011
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,346
I guess there are other names.

1012
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,430
(COUGHS)

1013
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,225
LOGAN: We have to be united
on this.

1014
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,978
-It's a disaster if we splinter.
-(COUGHS)

1015
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,604
Salgado has great narrative.

1016
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,940
Quit butt-huffing Salgado, Shiv.

1017
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,942
We all supported
your little DC lemonade stand,

1018
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,986
but this is the fucking
real world.
This actually matters.

1019
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,237
SHIV: Roman, you just love
the boot
