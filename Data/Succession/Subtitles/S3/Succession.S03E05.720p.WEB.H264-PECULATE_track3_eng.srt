345
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,778
Uh, I don't do ancient history.

346
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,864
CONNOR: I don't wanna get into
ancient history either.

347
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,366
So... (CLICKS TONGUE)

348
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,825
Can we...

349
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,661
find common ground?

350
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,372
I just don't think you have
the track record.

351
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,956
Roman's a knucklehead.

352
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,625
Shiv's a fake.

353
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,086
Kenny is screwy!

354
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,338
-Why can't I get a shot?
-Like what?

355
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,465
Europe. Nothing vital.

356
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,008

is out of order,

00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,560

up the stairs and on your right.

I'm wearing my sneakers, huh?

-Sorry about--
-ROMAN: About what?

366
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,243
Trying to fuck me over
to consolidate your position?

367
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:35,994
GERRI: No.

368
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,540
It just seemed
to make business sense.

369
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,375
Throwing me overboard to drown?

370
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,044
You picked your prince, Gerri.

371
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,213
-Don't fuck it up now.
-They're gonna marinate
on it, but...

372
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,007
Yeah, I think I-- we did it.

373
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,593
So, yeah, fingers crossed.

374
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,011
Okay, see you soon.

375
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,641
Oh, you don't mind me
relaying the news, do you?

376
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,184
No, not at all.

378
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,814
Yeah.

Feeling those good vibrations.

Hey, yeah, I was wondering
if you were gonna be over here.

00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,078
Yeah, I'm over here,

Yeah. So, uh, hey, man.

probably pretty upset

Wow, uh, that's a huge relief,
'cause...

398
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,070
I've been summoned to see
my gramps today

399
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,280
and I just feel like

400
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,032
I don't want to be getting it
in both ends because--

401
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,950
But look,
I may have to burn you.

Yeah. (SIGHS)

and give you fair warning

408
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,131

409
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,424
KENDALL: Yeah, getting burned.

410
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,134
Is it okay-- Uh...

411
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,054
It doesn't sound great.

412
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,473
Yeah, so...

413
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,184
here's the thing.
My dad lands a deal today,

414
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,102
it strengthens his position.

415
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,064
Lisa says the DOJ is
non-committal about the case.

416
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,107
So, I need to
throw them red meat.

417
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,359
The thought is I give them you.

418
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,735
It's not much,
but it's a morsel.

419
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,196
Plus, it likely gives them Tom,
maybe Bill,

420
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,365
you know, it--
it builds the pressure,

421
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,325
and then maybe
someone flips on Dad.

422
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,494
You see?

423
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,498
GREG: Dude. (SIGHS)

424
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,333
It's not my preferred choice.

425
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,877
Or mine! I, uh--
I thought, you know,

426
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,003
you said you'd never burn me.

427
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,672
KENDALL: I said
I'd try not to burn you.

428
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,215
Well, no, you said...

429
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,633
-On the plane, you said--
-Hey! Hey!

430
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,884
Let's not
"He said, she said" this.

431
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,094
A lot of shit gets said.

432
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,805
Look.

433
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,015
I'm still not saying
I will burn you.

434
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,268
All I'm saying is
I might burn you.

435
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,519
It's a margin call.

436
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,480
And just how bad
will the burning be?

437
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,191
I mean, even as I ask that
I can tell it's not gonna be...

438
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,947
You'll probably be fine.

439
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,033
They don't want to send
bottom feeders to prison.

440
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,869
They'll probably just
fuck you and chuck you

441
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,287
to get to the red meat.

442
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,163
Uh-huh. Great.

443
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,166

Uh, I have to monitor
the meeting,

but I wanted to
give you a heads up.

And, hey, Mr. Pugh.
How are you?

00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:22,512
I'm not an uncomplicated man,
Greg. I know that.

You're the best
darn gramper out.

00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,858
Um, and I wanted, therefore,
to ask you--

469
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,276
EWAN: You asked me for help.

470
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,654
And I took
that request seriously.

471
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:44,117
And now I hear that you've
dispensed with Roger's services,

472
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,454
presumably to throw your lot in
with my brother

as a telephone call?

00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,378
Right.

00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,671

00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,632
if I shouldn't maybe take
another turn around the block

is to see
if there's any way that...

523
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,760
But we're close.

524
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,304
I think the lawyers can
finesse the rest, yeah?

GERRI: Yes.

526
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,557
Dad, you would've
fucking loved it.

527
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,809
Sandi is barely alive.

528
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,311
You could've told him to go
fucking eat his own diaper

529
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,479
and his only response would be,

-GERRI: Well we might--
-Hmm, yeah. They've got nowhere
else to maneuver, so.

534
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,656
Well, they could've
said yes in Greece.

-Saved us all the ball-ache.

bad for us?

always gonna settle.

Uh, something screwy going on.

543
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,968
Do we give them a taste
of their own medicine?

544
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,679
Let everyone know

-that they bent for me?
-SHIV: Uh...

546
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,851
Reopen the negotiation, Dad?

547
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,520
No, we settle now
or we go to the vote and lose.

inside the building!

this is but we need this.

SHIV: Christ, Dad!
You just said

551
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,697
it's not far off
what we originally offered.

552
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,783
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
We fuck this deal

553
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,660
and there are no more deals.

554
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,043
Uh-huh? Okay.

00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,047
Great.

556
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,717
Okay, thanks, Dad.
That's-- It's smart.

557
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,510
It is.

did you give her?

have bagels.

does, uh, people?

the private jets.

just basting the turkey?

personal use or a mileage cap.

for the PJs and I said nothing.

860
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,960
Shiv, do you--
Should you overrule him?

861
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,087
Go back to Sandy and Stewy and
say we've changed our minds?

862
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,505
Yeah, I think you should
totally do that.

863
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,007
Dad loves that kind of thing.
Yeah, do it. Overrule him.

864
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,341
GERRI: Yeah, no.
Can't do that. Can't do that.

865
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,928
Um, guys, he says he still needs
to make his speech.

866
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,389
-Uh, what do you think?
-Can he do the speech?

867
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,891
-Can-- Can he--
-Can he do the speech?

868
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,059
The demented fucking
piss-mad King of England?

869
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,812
He could say anything.
He could tell everyone
he's Barbra Streisand. No.

870
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,480
I think we have to
drop it, right?

871
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,316
But at the very least,
he should be on stage.

872
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,192
It would be great
to get the body up there.

873
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,986
Okay, we push it
as late as we can,

874
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,530
and maybe if we just get him
on stage, that'll be enough?

875
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,908
Oh, yeah, sure, maybe send him
up through a trap door

876
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,201
surrounded by dry ice.

877
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,911
GERRI:
Where is this doctor anyway?

878
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:49,790
He's... He's concerned there is
a dead cat under his chair.

879
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,084
-Oh, great, okay.
-GERRI: Is there anything
under the chair?

880
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,294
-No.
-Uh, Greg...

881
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,004
-GERRI: Oh, okay, great.
-SHIV: Give that to Frank.

882
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,131
HUGO: He seems
insistent and, uh...

883
00:36:57,214 --> 00:37:00,176
he says that, uh,
he doesn't want Rose to see it.

884
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,303
And he wants
Colin to take it out.

885
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,680
Fine, have Colin take it out.

886
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,933
-Okay.
-Good! Thanks, Hugo, thank you.

887
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,809
-KERRY: Hey!
-Okay!

888
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,019
KERRY: The doctor's on his way.

889
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,896
Why the fuck didn't you
mention this before, huh?

890
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,564
Um, he didn't want
anyone to know.

891
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,650
Okay, well, that's
worked out well, hasn't it?

892
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,361
Oh, fuck!

893
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,947
ROMAN: Oh, great! Hey!
Um, who invited you? Thanks.

894
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,782
So, what the fuck is going on?

895
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,784
-It's fine.
We got it under control.
-He's squashing the deal?

896
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,244
-We got it.
-You have to
turn this around right now!

897
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,913
-SHIV: Yeah. yeah.
-We got this
under control, okay?

898
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,248
SHIV: We're figuring it out.

899
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,458
-Thank you for your concern.
-(LOGAN YELLS INCOHERENTLY)

900
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,921
-(BABBLES INCOHERENTLY)
-What-- What's happening?

901
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,965
-ROMAN: His doctor's
on the way. Okay?
-What the fuck is going on?

902
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,132
It's fine, it's all right.

903
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,550
-KENDALL: What is that?
-Can you leave, please?

904
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,178
That is an imaginary cat.
Now could you please fuck off?

905
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,389
Listen to me very carefully.

906
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,473
-Okay.
-All of you.

907
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,309
This is you throwing it away.

908
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,561
You think they're bluffing?
They are not fucking bluffing.

909
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,605
And you're putting everything
I have fought and bled for

910
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,941
on the fucking edge, and
I am not gonna let that happen.

911
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,109
-Do you understand me?
-ROMAN: Yes.

912
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,777
-SHIV: You're not welcome here.
-You fix it!

913
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,487
You fucking fix it!

914
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,489
-You may go. You're excused.
-You're not welcome.
You have no right to be here.

915
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,075
-Please leave.
-Thank you very much for
your concern. Please, thank you.

916
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,118
Go, delusional.

917
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,452
Fucking delusional man
leaving the room.

918
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,288
And figure out a fucking doctor
or I'm calling mine.

919
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,665
-SHIV: Get the fuck out of here.
-Thank you so much
for your concern.

920
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,833
Like you give a fuck!

921
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,252
You probably slipped
him something, Putin. Fuck!

922
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,546
SHIV: Dad.

923
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,173
(MUTTERING FRANTICALLY)

924
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,552
-Keep Frank on.
-LOGAN: Why is Frank so angry?

925
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,097
-Oh, uh, that's Kendall.
-LOGAN: Is Frank upset?

926
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,099
No, some people were
nasty to Frank.

927
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,892
-It's fine now, though.
-Very mad, people were yelling.

928
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,728
-LOGAN: Who was nasty to him?
-No, no, you sit down.

929
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,855
-Don't worry, he's okay.
-LOGAN: Nobody should be...

930
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,315
I'm the only one who's
allowed to be nasty.

931
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,027
TOM: No, there were
some silly people
and they've gone now.

932
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,320
(MUTTERING) Shit.

933
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,576
And we will all
work together as a team

934
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,495
to lead the company
to a brighter future.

935
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:04,884
And now I will hand you over to
Gerri Kellman, our interim CEO.

936
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,889
(APPLAUSE)

937
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,307
You cowardly prick!

938
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,021
Thank you, Frank.

939
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,482
(SIGHS)

940
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,818
I'd like to begin by reflecting

941
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,321
on some of the many changes

942
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:29,617
I have seen
in my 30 years at Waystar.

943
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,912
SHIV: Hey!

944
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,915
He's on fluids and hydrating.

945
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,249
So it should be pretty quick.

946
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,709
He's definitely gonna be okay?

947
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,960
But, uh, how quick?

948
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,755
Well, he's not
a cup of instant noodles.

949
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,131
Sure, but can we speed it up?

950
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,884
Like a blood bag
or an adrenaline shot?

951
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,135
ROMAN: Geez.
Fucking take it easy.

952
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,137
You wanna give him
the fucking Tabasco suppository?

953
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,472
Fuck you! It's what he'd want.

954
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,432
Fuck you. The main thing is
that we look after him, okay?

955
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,059
Yeah, well, obviously
I agree, Roman.

956
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,268
Oh, yeah? Really?

957
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,812
'Cause it sounded like
you want to jumpstart our father

958
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,772
like he's a fucking
pick-up truck.

959
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,360
Oh, shit. Um, can you like
call me when he's less...

960
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,861
scary?

961
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,988
GERRI: ...positive direction.

962
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,950
We will explore alternatives
for our cruise division,

963
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,452
including a
possible divestiture.

964
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,705
And we'll initiate
a share repurchase plan

965
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,125
and a special dividend.
And we'll be forming...

966
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,377
Doctor says he's gonna be fine,
but I don't know.

967
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,504
-It's fine, he's asleep.
-GERRI: ...spearheaded by

968
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,216
our visionary Chief Operating
Officer, Roman Roy.

-(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)
-GREG: Hey, yeah, yeah.

970
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,889
I was-- I was wondering, just,
in your view

971
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,476
do you think it's possible
to sue a person,

972
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,687
uh, a grandparent for example,

973
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,897
uh, in a way which is like...

974
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,692
like in an affectionate way?

975
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,986
That might convey, like,

976
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,530
"I love you and, I'm glad you're
a part of my life,

977
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,949
but I am taking
legal action against you"?

-KAROLINA: This isn't--

979
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,495
This isn't turning
any floating votes our way.

980
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,747
Should we, uh,
call in a bomb threat?

981
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,292
-Hey!
-Okay.

982
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,878
So, his moaning's
getting louder.

983
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,046
Okay, but can he
do that on stage?

984
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,674
-Is it a wheel on and wave?
-ROMAN: Fuck. Like we're not

985
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:12,052
gonna make the piss-mad bear
dance with fucking cattle prods.

986
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,596
We need to be
looking after him, okay?

987
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,514
So, he's not
gonna do his speech?

988
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,474
FRANK: Well...
Is-- Is he talking?

989
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,561
Is that it though? Do we just--
Does, does that-- Do we go down?

990
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,188
And fucking give up?

991

-HUGO: No.

993
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,901
Talk to me.

994

-Uh...
-SHIV: Come on!

995
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:32,531
I would strongly urge you to do
whatever you can to settle.

996
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,700
SHIV: Okay, I think
we go back to Sandy and Stewy

997
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,285
-and try and save the deal.
-Yes.

998
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,204
ROMAN: No. No, you can't.
Because Dad said no deal.

999
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,914
-No, Dad didn't say shit, Rome.
-Dad said no deal!

1000
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,917
No, he didn't! His urethra had
wrested control from his brain!

1001
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,045
I at least talk to them, right?

1002
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,880
-TOM: Right.
-KARL: Yeah.

1003
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,965
'Cause if we go to the vote,
we probably...

1004
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,258
we lose. Karl?

1005
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,053

-Yeah.

-SHIV: Tom? Yes?
-Yes, yes.

1008
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,017
-I say yeah.
-SHIV: Okay. Rome?
You back this?

1009
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,311
Um...

1010
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,524
Go on. Yeah.
Go fuck it up, moron.

1011
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,404
Hey!

1012
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,114
Uh, I was wondering
if we could have another chat?

1013
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,075
Just the two of us,
before the vote closes?

1014
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,869
Thank you for your support.

1015
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,165
This is the power of Waystar.

1016
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:27,419
A bright new beginning, but
the journey remains the same.

1017
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,046
(CLEARS THROAT)

1018
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,677
We at Waystar Royco...

1019

KAROLINA: She's dried up.
Just couldn't do it.

1020
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,307
She hit the video,
but we have to close this vote.

1021
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,767
This is it.

1022
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,311
Um, I've got
the White House on the line.

1023
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,730
Oh, yeah, they've been coming
at us from all sides

1024
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,856
since the ATN pivot.

1025
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,276
KERRY: It's not Michelle-Anne.
It's the President.

1026
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,945
He wants an urgent conversation.

1027
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,197
-Oh.
-On-- on that phone, now?

1028
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,534
Mm-hm. Yeah, I mean, on mute.
But it's the switchboard.

1029
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,286
He wants Logan.

1030
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,705
Right, well, that's not ideal.

1031
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,291
I mean, can we just say no?

1032
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,792
FRANK: Well, uh, how do we feel

1033
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,919
about saying no
to the President right now?

1034
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,171
Oh, I would love
to say no to the President.

1035
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,965
ROMAN:
I mean, he can't talk to Dad.

1036
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,925
Uh, can we just tell him
to fuck off?

1037
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,844
I mean, by all accounts,
he won't remember by tomorrow?

1038
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,221
KERRY: Yeah, I was wondering
if it might be about

1039
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,640
the DOJ and everything.

1040
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,769
I mean,
it's fucking late, but...

1041
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:30,524
if the pressure got turned down
and we can leak it and, uh,

1042
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,568
and then we throw Gerri
back up on stage

1043
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,278
-and just keep her talking--
-I can do it.

1044
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,571
TOM: I think-- No.

1045
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,990
I think, maybe, Shiv. Shiv.
Can we get Shiv back, Frank?

1046
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,325
Uh, Gerri!

1047
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,617
Gerri, hey, Gerri!
We need someone--

1048
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,995
Gerri, we need someone
sensible to talk to the, uh...

1049
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,455
-President right now...
-CONNOR: I can do it.

1050
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,123
...urgently on
an urgent personal matter.

1051
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,667
-Roman, you've met him, right?
-KAROLINA: Well--
well, if it's between--

1052
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,462
sorry, Roman and Gerri,
I would definitely--

1053
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,047
I'll talk to him,
the little bitch, here.

1054
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,841
Um, should we hurry?
Because I think
it's kind of urgent.

1055
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,968
I mean, I can do it, but...

1056
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,804
Roman, you get on
with them, right?

1057
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,766
I mean, if anyone here
is bootleg Logan,

1058
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,309
Roman...

1059
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,562
Okay, gimme.

1060
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:10,814
Just explain it's out of respect
and you can take the message--

1061
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,941
Yeah, yeah, I got it. It's just
the President. It's fine.

1062
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,527
HUGO: This guy? Tony Tourette's?
Are you kidding? Are you sure?

1063
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,071
-Don't swear at him!
-Oh, really?

1064
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,615
It's not cool to tell
the President to blow me?

1065
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,493
Hey, Mr. President.
This-- Sorry.

1066
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,411
Yeah, no--

1067
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,704
Cross-talk. You go.

1068
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, no this is, uh, actually,
I'm his son, Roman.

1069
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,252
Yup, that one.

1070
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,755
Look, he can't talk
right now, but, uh...

1071
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,590
how you doing?

1072
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:42,012
Yeah, I will certainly
let him know that you are upset.

1073
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,640
Hey, I can't leave my dad alone,
so what's going on?

1074
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:45,933
SHIV: Uh, look.

1075
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,267
Upon further reflection,

1076
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,478
we have decided
to accept your counter.

1077
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,940
-We can eat the jets.
-Okay, uh...

1078
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,858
-Any context?
-Uh, no.

1079
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,110
We took another look

1080
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,903
and thought that this was
the clearest way forward.

1081
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,406
And this is what your dad wants?

1082
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,866
Yeah, it is what my dad wants.

1083
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,576
Well-- well, good. This is good.

1084
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,120
SHIV: Great, so, we're good?

1085
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,539
We're, you know,
we're going to be good?

1086
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,583
Sure, um...

1087
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,962
well, honestly, knowing where
my dad is coming from,

1088
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,631
I do just wonder
if there will be one more thing.

1089
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,216
So, don't turn your phone off.

1090
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,384
Okay, come on, look.

1091
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,053
Is there something
that we can work out here?

1092
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,388
You know, it's now or never.

1093
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,973
Well, I-- I-- I don't know.

1094
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,226
Sandi, look, I...

1095
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,187
I don't think it's right

1096
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,440
how your dad sidelines you
in all this.

1097
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,485
And maybe it's appropriate

1098
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,238
for me to have somebody
like-minded on the board.

1099
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:44,992
So, how about...

1100
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,911
a fourth seat...

1101
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,080
on the board...

1102
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,582
for you.

1103
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,128
You can tell him that
you screwed it out of us

1104
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,715
and my dad was losing his shit
and it nearly killed him.

1105
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:00,966
-Four seats? That's--
-SHIV: Yeah.

1106
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,759
That's a lot of seats.
He will like that.

1107
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,386
-Yeah.
-SANDI: Yeah.

1108
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,055
Well, it is one more
than three by my count.

1109
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,933
So, Waystar, for balance,
will need an extra one.

1110
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,603
For me.

1111
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:13,937
I see.

1112
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,356
Uh, yeah, he won't love that.

1113
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,901
Okay, well, look,
just tell him that...

1114
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,611
the fucking,
the markets will never let

1115
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,029
me or my brothers be CEO.

1116
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,780
SANDI: Oh, come on.
Do you believe that?

1117
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,452
I just care
if your dad believes it.

1118
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,456
Uh-huh.

1119
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,459
Uh, look, I should go.

1120
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:36,543
See if I can sell it.

1121
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,754
But this is,
this is good with Logan?

1122
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,922
I can sell it.

1123
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,757
Can you sell it?

1124
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,310
Well, I will relay that.

1125
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,605
You are not running again,
and he hopes that we're happy.

1126
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,274
-No!
-We need the access!

1127
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,318
And I mean,
and that's decided already?

1128
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,903
Because, you know, I think that,

1129
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,989
uh, whatever our
minor differences,

1130
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,951
we would urge you
to not stand aside.

1131
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,120
Uh-huh.

1132
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,957
Yup, but no. I will be
the messenger boy.
Happy to be that.

1133
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,375
I just think-- Yeah.

1134
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,753
I just think that our position,
and speaking for my father here,

1135
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:22,214
um, you know, good friends
can be really tough

1136
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:25,008
with their constructive
criticisms, but, um...

1137
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,176
we would just say, you know,

1138
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,594
and I think that you are

1139
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,931
a really significant
historical figure

1140
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,432
who has a lot more to give.

1141
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,060
Yeah, well, the whole family
at ATN could rally round.

1142
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:38,564
It would be a shame, you know,
sir, to lose you, so...

1143
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,606
Absolutely.

1144
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,651
Uh-huh.

1145
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:50,200
Well, uh, in that case, uh,
Mr. President,

1146
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,786
it has been a privilege
to have the opportunity, yeah.

1147
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,748
Best of luck to you, and okay!

1148
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,166
All right, so...

1149
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,668
Uh, yeah. He just wanted to

1150
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,169
let us know that
he's not gonna run again.

1151
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,629
-He's pulling out.
-HUGO: Fucking fuck!

1152
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,048
Yeah. His minor
neurological issue,

1153
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,926
which you know, the media,
starting with us,

1154
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,428
have blown way out of proportion

1155
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,639
and he doesn't want to put
his wife and kids and family

1156
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,182
through all
the blah, blah, blah.

1157
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,892
And fuck Dad, and fuck me,

1158
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,145
and fuck ATN, and Ravenhead,

1159
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,522
and good luck getting the kind
of access that he granted

1160
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,107
with whoever
is the next President.

1161
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,735
Which, if left up to him,
could be a chicken.

1162
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,361
-Fuck!
-ROMAN: Yeah.

1163
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,571
Shit.

1164
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,948
-Boom-shaka-laka! Hell yeah!
-ROMAN: Fuck yeah, Connor,

1165
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,867
I think we just alienated
our most powerful ally.

1166
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,453
I mean, it's kind of
nice to know that we can, like,

1167
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:37,789
puppet master the whole
American Republic project
and all, but--

Shiv!

1170

Four seats.

-GERRI: What?
-We eat the PJs.

1172
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,093
We get a seat. We get a seat.

1173
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,429
Yeah, that was
pretty hard to finesse, but...

1174
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,848
Sandy and Sandi
are definitely...

1175
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,642
in, so...

1176
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,935
-Gerri, are we good?
-Four seats?

1177
00:48:59,019 --> 00:48:59,978
Oh, fuck!

1178
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,189
I would like to say yes to that.

1179
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,649
I just-- I--

1180
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,275
I think we need to
say yes to that, Gerri!

1181
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,485
Can I just-- At some point,

1182
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,737
Dad is gonna
walk out of there, so...

Four seats. No PJs.

Uh, we're good. We're good.
Yeah. No vote. Hold the voting.

-Okay, we're good.
-Yes!

1190
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,630
They're good.
It's a yes from this end, so...

1191
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,382
-Okay.
-TOM: We're good!

1192
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,676
Okay, they're good
if we're good! It's done.

1193
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,219
-KARL: Great. Great.
-GERRI: Okay, uh...

1194
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,513
-Boom!
-So, um,
we need to talk to the lawyers.

1195
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,556
They need to plug in the new
details and get signatures

1196
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,350
and then we can
talk to the shareholders.

1197
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,894
Right, well, Frank, you've done
so much already,

1198
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,896
-I would be happy to.
-GERRI: Oh, I see.

1199
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:46,233
Okay, so, we will publish
a press release as Karl--

1200
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,777
as Karl--
as he's announcing it. Right.

1201
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,237
TOM: Fucking superhero!

1202
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,905
(BOTH LAUGH)

1203
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,532
The world's on fire!

1204
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,826
Thank you! Thanks, honey.

1205
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,452
Hey, you wanna get
a hotel room tonight?

1206
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,246
-Hotel? I think there's, uh...
-Yeah.

1207
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,250
...rooms in the apartment
we've never fully walked into.

1208
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,086
I think there's just something
about the way you

1209
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,797
smell and the way your body
looks at this time of the mont--

1210
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,425
-You know, I'm like a dog.
-What time?

1211
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,884
-Time of the?
-I think. I think...

1212
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,262
I'm just most horny when you're
the most fertile, you know.

1213
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,430
That's how it works, right?

1214
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,639
Is this--

1215
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,891
Tom, why you asked me
when my period was?

1216
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,435
-No!
-(GIGGLES) Are you tracking me?

1217
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,146
No, we're like a sorority house.
We're in sync.

1218
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,606
I'm just vibing
to your sexy window.

1219
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,024
Uh...

1220
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,360
Tom, are you
keeping a shadow log?

1221
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,695
Watching the phases of the moon

1222
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,405
to see when
I'm the most breedable?

1223
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,032
No, I just, like,
counted the days on my iCal.

1224
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,242
-It's not creepy.
-SHIV: Oh, my God!

1225
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,244
It's not creep--
No, it's not, come on.

1226
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,454
I've got like...

1227
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,248
six more ovulation windows
until all sex is prison sex.

1228
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,624
I said I didn't like the timing.

1229
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,460
Well, I think the timing's good.
Like, nine to twelve months

1230
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,128
is kind of what
I'm hoping I might serve.

1231
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,838
I think it's a good slot.

1232
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,423
What? Put one in
for when you're out?

1233
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,092
No, no! It's--
It would keep you--

1234
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,636
-SHIV: What?
-Like, not company, but--

1235
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,680
I might need something, Shiv.

1236
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,432
Okay? Otherwise,
what is the point of all this?

1237
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,641
Where are we heading?

1238
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,602
Tom, I don't want to be
your fucking incubator for...

1239
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,895
when you're in prison

1240
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,439
doing chin-ups
and reading Knausgaard.

1241
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,857
You're making it sound horrible.

1242
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,692
And it's not horrible.
It's nice.

1243
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,486
-SHIV: Oh my God.
-It's supposed to be nice.

1244
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,029
SHIV: Fuck.

1245
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,868
Yeah, I should be out there.
You know, I'm hiding back here.

1246
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,578
It makes me look like
I'm losing,

1247
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,954
when actually, I'm winning.

1248
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,539
-Your very absence--
-Plus, Stewy says

1249
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,625
we have the deal,
so it's safe.

1250
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,628
Your very absence
has a certain power.

1251
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,380
Uh-huh. I think my absence makes
me look like a little bitch.

1252
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,424
We believe this
dynamic action plan

1253
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,344
will restore full confidence
in the Waystar brand

1254
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:41,139
for both our consumers
and our employees alike.

1255
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,851
We've addressed systemic issues
that affected us historically.

1256
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,896
And we vow to do better
moving forward.

1257
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:52,484
Because at Waystar, we've
always cared about women--

1258
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:57,030
Uh, yes, uh, may I just
interrupt for just a moment.

1259
00:51:57,113 --> 00:52:00,659
Uh, we are very,
very pleased to report

1260
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,411
that a settlement
has been reached

1261
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,998
with Maesbury Capital
and Furness Media Groups

1262
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,166
-which will--
-(APPLAUSE)

1263
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,003
Thank you.
We're all overjoyed.

1264
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:16,800
And Logan, uh, Logan Roy just
desperately wanted to be here

1265
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,887
to address his shareholders
at this very important time.

1266
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,889
He's a details guy, my friends.

1267
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,267
And he's been working
very hard on this.

1268
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,145
And he will be, um, connecting
with his shareholders...

1269
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,897
-SHIV: Oh, fuck me!
-Oh, my God.

1270
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,149
Fucking stop him!
Step on his balls! Stop him!

1271
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,609
Don't we have a guy?

1272
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,819
-HUGO: Yup. Yup.
-Do we have security?

1273
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,863
(CLEARS THROAT)
Sorry, do you mind?

1274
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,614
What? What are you doing?

1275
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,492
-I'll take it from here.
-No, no, no, no.

1276
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,411
-Step aside, please.
-Ken, don't do this.

1277
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,705
-Karl Muller, everyone.
-(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

1278
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,665
SHIV: We can't--
We can't do anything about this.

1279
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,500
-HUGO: Where's Colin?
-We can't manhandle him.

1280
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,168
-CONNOR: Colin is with...
-Can't we?

1281
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,254
-CONNOR: Colin's with Pop.
-He's with Logan.

1282
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,631
You know, I'm not actually...

1283
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,800
I'm not actually
scheduled to speak today.

1284
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,595
I would like to say this.

1285
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,556
I'd like to ask you all

1286
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,349
to please join with me...

1287
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,768
in a moment of silence...

1288
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,938
for all the victims of crimes
that took place on our watch.

1289
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,320
Keira Mason.

1290
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,238
-SHIV: Oh, my God!
-GERRI: Oh, my God.

1291
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,449
-HUGO: Cut his mic.
Make sure his mic is cut.
-He's so annoying.

1292
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,117
-KAROLINA:
You're not being silent.
-SHIV: The narcissism of

1293
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,411
-this fucking guy!
-You know what?
He looks crazy...

1294
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,331
-HUGO: Yes, now.
-...and I think
that can be good for us.

1295
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,957

1299
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,803
HUGO: Did-- did they cut--
They, yes, okay.

1300
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,806
-Yeah, but I can still hear.
-'Cause he's loud as fuck.

1301
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,476
We can still hear him.
Cut all mics, please.

1302
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,061
He's not even wearing a tie.

1303
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:57,275
I would just like to announce
that I am launching a foundation

1304
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,946
in the name of victims
who suffered sexual abuse

1305
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,239
in the hands of
my family's company.

1306
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,241
Thank you!

1307
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,995

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1309
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,144
We should've chopped him down.

1310

GERRI: Yeah, well.

1311
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,983
I guess it might've
seemed suspicious.

1312
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,276
Kind of like shredding
a human document.

1313
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,653
Four seats.

1314
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:42,904
And the Raisin gone.

1315
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,408
What if we get
a more aggressive DOJ?

1316
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,702
You feeling better?

1317
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,663
So, here I was thinking
about European cable,

1318
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,249
and then boom, open sesame!

1319
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,417
Can you believe it?

1320
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,669
-CYD PEACH:
It is hard to believe.
-Yeah.

1321
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,379
-Have a good time.
-CONNOR: Thank you.

1322
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,173
Yeah, so, I have a little bit
of a development.

1323
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:07,012
Apparently, I can't technically
sue Ewan while he's still alive,

1324
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,889
but I can sue Greenpeace.

1325
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,850
You're going to sue Greenpeace?

1326
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,478
I like your style, Greg.

1327
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,188
Who do you think you're
gonna go after next?

1328
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,273

Uh...

1331
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:27,198
I think, uh,
every attendee of today's

1332
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,908
shareholder meeting can agree

1333
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,745
we've heard more than enough
out of me today.

1334
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,623
But I just want to say,
well done to all.

1335
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,168
Well done to Logan,
well done to Shiv,

1336
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,087

You did it.

1340
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,388
Uh, I need to see
all the detail.

1341
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,973
Oh, Dad, the detail's good.

1342
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,308
The seat was the only way.

1343
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,603
That's what people on the shitty
end of the deal always say.

1344
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,771
Four seats.

1345
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,523
But I stipulated that
we need a seat of our own.

1346
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,193
And we've talked
about that, right?

1347
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,111
Adding another person
to the board. Like me?

1348
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,114
Or Connor,
you know, or whoever.

00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,126
What would--
What would you have done, then?

1353
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,378
LOGAN: Not that.

1354
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,922
Okay, but what
would you have done?

1355
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,298
I'd have figured it out.

1356
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,388
Time to think on next moves.

1357
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,142
Uh, don't you want to just
savor this moment for a minute?

1358
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,812
To, you know,
that we came out of this alive?

1359
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,564
There's blood in the water,
the sharks are coming.

1360
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,109
We should hustle on acquisition.

1361

Just take this
for a toast, yeah?

1362
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,737
Oh, God!

1363
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:52,742
Shiv, I'm trying to talk to
Gerri about something important.

1364
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:57,413
Stop buzzing in my fucking ear!

1365

Hey, come here.

1371
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,226
Come on. I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna hump you.

1372
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,395
Just give you a hug.
It's just a hug.

1373

Come on.

1374
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,149

It was good that you
mentioned the foundation.

-Personalized the whole thing.
-Yeah. What's the feedback?

1380
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:46,296

-Hi.
-Yeah, what's up?

1386
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,388
You mind sticking around
for a little bit?

1387
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:56,848
Because I think
your dad wants a word.

1388
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,057
Yeah, what's he got?

1389
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,727

or the bullwhip?
