1
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:40,828
Mr. Roy, we'd like to move on
to the matter of these illegal payments

2
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:45,458
Fine. I mean, we've done that but...

3
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:50,395
Specifically, your first hand
knowledge of what happened.

4
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,939
Yup. Yup. Got it.

5
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:55,859
What we want you to explain
to us based on what you saw

6
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:59,320
And heard is how these
illegal payments were made

7
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:02,949
- Were approved, and by whom.
- Yup. Got it. What's next?

8
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:10,665
- You wanna answer the question?
- I think I'm good

9
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,753
Okay. Fine.

10
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:23,261
Well, I approved the illegal payments
because I love sexual assault

11
00:02:23,386 --> 00:02:26,097
And I love to cover it up.

12
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:28,641
How.... how... how is that?
Uh, is that bad?

13
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,143
- That's bad?
- Okay. We can. we can wrap up.

14
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:33,521
I just will privately run the...
the timeline at home, but yeah.

15
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:35,148
I'm good, we're good, right?

16
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:39,110
Good. And yeah
just humble, straightforward...

17
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:41,571
- Hide the agenda.
- No agenda.

18
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:47,660
Sure. They're government employees.
I mean, how smart can they be?

19
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:51,498
I'm not saying that. I'm saying
what you think I think, right?

20
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:54,501
And... and just so we're on the same
page in terms of aims for me

21
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:57,253
The wish list
goes immunity for yours truly

22
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,839
Taskforce for Waystar
my dad deaded.

23
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:03,510
Well, I don't do requests because
I'm not a DJ, but I hear you

24
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:08,515
Look, come in here.
They're jigsawing all the papers.

25
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:11,601
- Hey, paper people.
- Morning.

26
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:13,228
Morning.

27
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:17,482
You know, Waystar
is now cooperating.

28
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:21,027
Helpfully offering up one billion
pages of documents

29
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:24,072
Hiring white... shoe, former
DOJ types to conduct an internal

30
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:27,200
That looks super
scrupulous, offering up employees

31
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:31,621
For talks with DOJ and worker
safety protocols around cruises.

32
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:36,042
We can adjust, but...
this isn't a slam dunk here.

33
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:42,423
Uh...huh. But... The papers. Yeah?

34
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:44,092
- I mean...
- Once you pull everything out

35
00:03:44,217 --> 00:03:48,138
That falls under other jurisdictions
or maritime law, or is privileged

36
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:50,140
Or is outside the statute of limitations...

37
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:54,769
But an FCPA angle
obviates those objections, right?

38
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:58,189
Well, the stuff that works
for Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

39
00:03:58,314 --> 00:04:00,191
Is inferential.
Waystar was careful.

40
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,776
So you're saying the papers are bullshit?

41
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:04,571
I'm just saying they lacked
some of the explosiveness

42
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:06,072
It was suggested they might have.

43
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:11,286
Well... I can reposition the context
in the public arena

44
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:15,331
Maybe... maybe...
maybe I can flip someone up the tree.

45
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,375
I just feel like sometimes
we're allowing the tune to be played

46
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,670
At my dad's tempo, Lisa
and I'm not sure why.

47
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,338
I have the, quote... unquote

48
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:25,550
"Best lawyer in town".
I have the best story

49
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:28,553
- I have fucking receipts.
- I hear you're concerned.

50
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,973
You have a big day tomorrow, okay?

51
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:34,434
This happens the night before

52
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:39,105
- Rest up, okay?
- Thank you. Yeah. And... and I...

53
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,193
Look, I really value all the
work you do, honestly

54
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:46,237
But let's try harder.

55
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:48,615
Yeah?
Let's try harder. Thank you.

56
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:13,932
I miss the big boot.
At least you could hear him coming.

57
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:20,647
- Clearly fucking.
- Dad and Kerry? Please.

58
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:23,858
Showing memes to a young menial?
Tale as old as time.

59
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:26,069
No, he hates the
close proximity bang.

60
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:27,695
He's still really into blowjobs I hear.

61
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,697
You just wanna give him a blowjob,
so stop projecting.

62
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:33,785
- Hey, Romulus.
- Looks like he wants one now.

63
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:38,706
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Well played, the internet.

64
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:45,546
- Okay. Um... Shiv, Tom... Hugo.
- You're disgusting.

65
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,593
Okay. So your dad has been
drawing up priorities for the weekend

66
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:54,180
He wants everyone
hitting anti tech positions hard.

67
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:58,434
Regulate and strangulate.
They're getting too powerful.

68
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:02,230
- Everybody knows it.
- Stop tech eating our lunch

69
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:03,982
Put in a new friend at the top

70
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:08,653
One who won't fire up justice
about our, um, boring old case.

71
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:11,572
Yeah. And maybe eat a bellyful
of humble pie about accidentally

72
00:06:11,698 --> 00:06:13,992
Knocking over their President
and smashing him on the floor?

73
00:06:14,284 --> 00:06:17,662
Boo...hoo, It's not our fault the President's
Brain couldn't thunk good no more.

74
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:20,707
Go offense. Spread it round that
if the Raisin goes for us

75
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:24,794
He's, uh politicizing
the Cruises case. It's so sad

76
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,504
His Justice Department has a grudge.

77
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:29,090
I might have heard that the deputy AG

78
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,054
Has a picture of me on
her dartboard, which is disgusting.

79
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,932
Wait, have... have we heard that or...

80
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:39,475
That is the rumor that's going around.

81
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:42,937
Yeah. Funny how these rumors get started.

82
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:47,233
Yeah. It's disgusting.

83
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:57,785
Hey. Mind if I jump in with you, Dad?

84
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,581
Uh...oh. Okay, Pinky.

85
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:10,131
Can we go up a degree in the back?

86
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:16,095
- You okay?
- You gonna be a fucking sourpuss?

87
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:20,099
What? No. No, I just, uh...

88
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:22,352
The last time that we talked properly
You humiliated me

89
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:24,771
at the shareholder meeting
So I thought I should just check in.

90
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:29,025
It was a long day and I was unwell.

91
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:31,277
Uh...huh. Well...

92
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,365
I wanna say I'm concerned about
who you might endorse this weekend.

93
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:38,534
- The Vice President.
- You're scared of Dave Boyer?

94
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:41,746
Yeah. Nothing is more dangerous
than a second rate individual

95
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:45,958
- Who sees his chance.
- I need to keep my spoon in the soup.

96
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:51,089
Fine. And... I don't think this is the place
to let Roman be the mouthpiece

97
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,591
- He's maturing
- Yeah. And I love him.

98
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:57,011
But he fucked the phone call with the Raisin.
That's an existential risk

99
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:59,972
And the only solid thing
he actioned in LA Dad,

100
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:03,684
was the movie Dr. Honk about
the man who could talk to cars.

101
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:07,563
Yeah. And we're walking in there
with a different hundred aims

102
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,732
And I think some nuance is required.

103
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:14,612
I'm just glad that we still have a company
to act on behalf of thanks to me.

104
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,658
Kerry, give Shiv a fucking medal.

105
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:43,391
- All right, enough. Let's go.
- Don't touch me.

106
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:49,981
Okay. Okay, so, if you guys go
to the left, the elevator is to the left

107
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:52,859
I have your room keys and welcome
drinks start in 20 minutes

108
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:07,957
Wow. I can really smell the panic.
Berlin Bunker vibes.

109
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,750
It is rather pungent.

110
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:13,087
Well, Ms. Libtard, how you do like
spelunking in the elephant's asshole?

111
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,298
I'm just a corporate observer.

112
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:17,300
Okay. Well, wait till the weekend's over

113
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:20,344
We'll get our white cis male
stank all over you.

114
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,138
It's just... it's such a thrill

115
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:24,765
I'm the probably the biggest
Conhead in Oklahoma.

116
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:29,061
Of course, Panhandle Pete.
You've met Maxim Pierce

117
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:30,771
He's my intellectual heft.

118
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:33,024
My Beltway Buddha.

119
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,734
I push him, he pushes me

120
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:36,944
- And around and around we go.
- it Is it just me

121
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:40,656
or in a room full of Timothy McVeighs
Does Connor suddenly look like a Roosevelt?

122
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:43,117
Sweetie. It's Panhandle Pete.

123
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:48,039
Frowny face here wanted
to stay home and work on her play

124
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:50,416
But duty calls for my leggy Mary Todd.

125
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,420
Yeah, that's fine I can totally
just write a play on my phone.

126
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,256
So, uh, how... how'd you two meet?

127
00:09:58,716 --> 00:10:00,259
- Online.
- Online.

128
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:04,055
Hi, folks. Just... just for a second.
Quiet for just a second

129
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,769
I want to thank you all for being here
on such short notice

130
00:10:09,894 --> 00:10:13,606
And I wanna thank you
for keeping your attendance private

131
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:17,860
Uh, what we do here
at the Future Freedom Summit

132
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:22,782
Is of the utmost importance
to our party and our country

133
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:26,661
I... I happen to believe the next
President of the United States

134
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:32,166
- Is somewhere in this very room.
- He is, and he's hard as a rock.

135
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,753
Oh, may God shepherd this person

136
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:40,007
- The health of our republic depends on it.
- And the health of my portfolio.

137
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:42,260
- And that.
- To the republic!

138
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:45,471
To the republic! Thank you. Republic.

139
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,935
Ron Petkus blew his son's archery instructor.

140
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:53,437
- True story.
- Blew his arc...

141
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:57,358
Um, some guy with an undercut
just called me Soy Boy?

142
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,902
Oh, don't worry, Greg
It's a nice safe space

143
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,821
where you don't have to pretend
to like Hamilton.

144
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:05,241
- Well, I like Hamilton.
- Sure, you do. We all do.

145
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:11,289
So, what... what...
what is this actually here?

146
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:15,084
This is just a nice political conference
of like minded donors

147
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:19,380
- And intellectuals.
- AKA picking the next President.

148
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:22,216
- Selecto el presidento.
- That's not...

149
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:25,469
- that's not really how it works.
- Yeah, no. Sure, but yeah.

150
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:27,930
Uh, but is that like constitutional?

151
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,391
Oh, I don't know, Greg.
You wanna call the referee?

152
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:32,310
- Is there an ombudsman in the house?
- Well...

153
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:34,061
- What is an ombudsman?
- Here they are.

154
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,147
The family who lost us a presidency.

155
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:40,860
- How is he, the Raisin?
- He's out of a job in six months,

156
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:45,072
lame in the interim And the GOP is in flames.
We're all doing backflips.

157
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:47,825
- Sorry about that.
- He's got a serious condition.

158
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:50,036
We felt the country needed to know.

159
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:52,580
So, uh, what are you hearing?

160
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:56,626
Well, with the president out we need a nominee
so welcome to clown town.

161
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,545
Six months to Election Day and no candidate

162
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:02,048
Super Tuesday's gone
ballots are already finalized

163
00:12:02,173 --> 00:12:04,091
The delegates will choose at the RNC of course

164
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:08,429
But I think we can all be real
and say we need to choose here first.

165
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:11,223
It's Boyer, right? We're going Boyer?

166
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:14,852
Yup. Cleanest option is the Vice President

167
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,646
The party needs to be united

168
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:19,940
So I hope since you started
this mess, you can help us clear it up.

169
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:22,526
- Dave's good. I like Dave.
- We all like Dave.

170
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:24,487
Steady old plow horse.

171
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,241
I heard his daughter has made him
go vegetarian, did you hear that?

172
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,454
No. No. Oh, no, I think I've seen him
eat a meatball.

173
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:37,291
No. Secret herbivore, I hear.

174
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:40,252
Boyer? It's his turn?

175
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:44,757
I don't really mind the lip licking thing.

176
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:50,721
- No. Is it bad?
- Not really.

177
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:54,850
It's, uh, just when you notice it
you definitely notice it.

178
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:58,312
As long as he doesn't do it much
during the debates, we should be fine.

179
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:01,065
The guy must have the wettest
lips in North America.

180
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,860
Yeah. It's like he's a cartoon bear
and there's always a picnic hamper nearby

181
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:07,905
Yeah, but Dave's great.
Congratulations, by the way.

182
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,534
Oh, okay. Uh, for what?
What have I done now?

183
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,996
For the wedding. Your mother

184
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:19,291
- Your mother is Caroline Collingwood, no?
- Yeah.

185
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,627
She's getting married, no? Peter Munion.

186
00:13:21,836 --> 00:13:25,756
No. No, she's in a relationship
with a canoe shaped gentleman named Rory.

187
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:29,844
Nope. Maybe it was somebody else.
Uh, pretty sure... No.

188
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,266
Oh. Look at that.
Um, you know how it is.

189
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:38,436
Families. Um, could
you forward that to me actually?

190
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:42,356
- Thank you. I'll see you around. Thank you.
- Okay.

191
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,775
Hey. Could you excuse us
for just a moment?

192
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,527
- Certainly. Certainly.
- Thank you so much...

193
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:49,155
Did you know about this
you withholding bitch?

194
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,825
- What?
- You know Glyn the Brexit pervert?

195
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:56,620
Yeah, he just sent this to me. Apparently,
our mother's marrying a Peter Munion.

196
00:13:56,996 --> 00:13:59,123
- What? Who's Peter Onion?
- I don't fucking know.

197
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:01,542
I wonder if that first born fucker knew.

198
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:03,461
Call him.

199
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:06,672
Sorry. Just give me a second...

200
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:09,300
- Yeah. What?
- "I'm here with Shiv."

201
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:11,051
Just wanted to let you know
new dad just dropped.

202
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:15,389
- I'm sorry. What?
- Yeah. Mommy's getting remarried dingus

203
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:16,974
- Did you know?
- Of course he didn't know.

204
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:19,393
- Ken bores the shit out of Mom.
- "What are you even talking about?"

205
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:21,812
You mean, uh, Rory?

206
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:23,647
"Uh, no. She took the view "fuck Rory.""

207
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:26,442
"Hey, Shiv, is it true, you're at that
hate fest fest?"

208
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:29,528
"Burning books and measuring skulls
down in Nuremberg, Virginia?"

209
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:32,531
Yeah. What are you doing with your weekend?

210
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:34,617
Planning to send us all to jail,
your favorite?

211
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:37,369
All right. Just, uh, wanted to let you
know Mommy still doesn't love you

212
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:38,913
Bye, Ken. Bye.

213
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:44,710
Hey, man. I... I just wanted
to uh, broach something with you.

214
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:48,839
- Broach away, Greg.
- So, yeah. Look, I'm... I'm pretty anxious.

215
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:52,968
Ken is saying he might burn me.

216
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:58,098
Are you threatening me?
You can't threaten me I'm immune.

217
00:14:58,349 --> 00:15:02,311
No, Tom. I was just thinking
about advice because I'm...

218
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:07,316
I'm obsessing over the prison of it all.

219
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:10,528
And, um, I just need to know
how to stop thinking.

220
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:12,696
- Yeah.
- It's just constant.

221
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:14,365
I tried that. Doesn't work

222
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:18,369
You know, what I'm preferring
is to always think about it

223
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:22,081
And then, when you don't,
for a moment it's like

224
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:25,584
"Oh, someone's loosened
their icy grip on my innards."

225
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:31,715
Yeah. I like that. I like it.

226
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,885
So you wanna try?

227
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,015
It's the Spatburgunder. Our vineyard.

228
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,603
Screw top.

229
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:48,065
"Black and brown avatars"

230
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:50,734
- "to smear and vilify."
- Did you hear Boyer's losing juice now?

231
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:53,779
- "In the Democratic Party..."
- So it's biodynamic.

232
00:15:55,948 --> 00:15:57,366
Has quite a funk to it.

233
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,535
"Engineered by the DNC"

234
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,455
"End the LSM in conjunction
with their big tech overlord"

235
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:06,792
- "Now, the rest of us..."
- You kind of have to meet it halfway, right?

236
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:10,379
- It's...
- You know, it's... earthy?

237
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:13,716
- Yeah.
- Kind of, hmm, Germanic.

238
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:17,511
Yeah, there's lots to unpack.
It's... it's not... it's not floral

239
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,392
It's not sugary or vegetal.
It's... it's... it's...

240
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:28,105
It's quite agricultural, you know.
It's... it's... it's a... It's...

241
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,694
It's not very nice, is it, the wine, Shiv?

242
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:35,738
"It's true, we see this a lot,
this so called..."

243
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:40,242
You know, if Boyer flames out,
then maybe it's time to...

244
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,079
- It might be time to pivot party.
- So my prison consultant called

245
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,290
And it looks like the place upstate
might be full.

246
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:52,004
- It's all the same.
- Well, you're tired.

247
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:53,839
You'll feel better about that in the morning.

248
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:57,217
Oh, yeah? One day closer
to my incarceration, right?

249
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,263
Apparently the food in jail is really bland.

250
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:05,726
- I mean, I know it's the same every day...
- Tom.

251
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:10,064
I don't get why you keep
wanting to talk about it.

252
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:13,734
Okay. I'm sorry.

253
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,986
Does the topic of my imminent imprisonment

254
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:17,863
- bore you?
- Come on, you're just... you're obsessing

255
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:21,283
I just... I can't keep going
round and round, okay?

256
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,796
Honey, I don't know
what else there is to say.

257
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:40,886
I'm sorry

258
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:44,890
- Hey.
- Hey.

259
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:01,365
No?

260
00:18:01,824 --> 00:18:03,200
Oh, sure.

261
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:06,745
- Okay.
- You know what?

262
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:09,707
There's not really any point.

263
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,460
Uh, to making love?

264
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:16,046
Yeah. Well, if you're still on contraception

265
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:19,842
It's just like throwing
so much cake batter at a brick wall.

266
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:27,850
I think what I realized
is that I'm just not that interested

267
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,810
in being a commercial playwright.

268
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:32,646
I mean, the audience helped
you discover that, didn't they, babe?

269
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,775
Yeah. Well, beauty and brains.
Oh, I probably shouldn't say that

270
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:38,819
Um, will I be cancelled?

271
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:43,574
Oh, no. No. No. Well, who knows?
You know, the night is young, so

272
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:46,285
Uh, yeah. I...I just...
I don't know how you do it.

273
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,621
How do you make up things
that aren't already there?

274
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:52,791
Oh, you don't know the half of it.
We talk long into the night

275
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:58,047
Ideas, literary, global...
Macro, micro, cosmo.

276
00:18:58,213 --> 00:18:59,590
`We bounce off each other.

277
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,425
Well, that sounds delightful.

278
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:05,054
- No. I mean, well yeah.
- Con?

279
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:08,640
You should come to Pound Ridge
one weekend.

280
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:13,312
Both of you, um, unless
you're tired or busy, one.

281
00:19:13,437 --> 00:19:15,981
- One and all.
- we'd love that wouldn't we, chicken?

282
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:17,649
I don't know if you're invited.

283
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:21,528
Yeah. Let me circulate

284
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:25,783
And I will rehydrate this gorgeous
creature on my return.

285
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:27,534
Cancelled.

286
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:31,747
You... Oh, Jake. Yeah, yeah.

287
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:33,457
Fun guy.

288
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:36,668
Con, maybe don't abandon me upstate
with Larry Lech here, okay?

289
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:39,546
- It's weird.
- Very influential.

290
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,049
- We're just showing a bit of leg.
- Yeah, my leg.

291
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:45,427
The collective leg. He's a huge donor.

292
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:50,099
And maybe I don't wanna donate
my body to political science, huh?

293
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,903
Hey, man. What's up?

294
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:05,948
Oh, okay. Yeah, it's the, uh
it's the ghost pepper

295
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:07,908
The spicy new flavor. Mencken.

296
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:11,370
So what's your deal? Most people here
wanna fuck me or kill me.

297
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,705
- How about you?
- I always found it hard

298
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:15,207
to care about politics, so...

299
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,794
Well, listen, here's my
party trick, all right?

300
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,421
- Okay.
- Tell me who your enemy is

301
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,966
and I'll tell you who you are.

302
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:30,806
Okay. Put a pin in that one.
Um, I've seen your poll numbers

303
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:34,977
You're dark horsin' it. People are
buying your whole, huh?

304
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:38,021
They better buy it
or I'll send them to the gulag.

305
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:39,940
Oh, okay. Now we're talking.

306
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:43,569
I don't know. No work camps.
Yeah. Like... like summer camps.

307
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:48,282
- Summer camps but with beatings
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No beatings

308
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:52,119
Well, this is nice.

309
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:54,454
Couple of cool
guys having some disgusting fun.

310
00:20:56,123 --> 00:21:00,878
So, uh... do you guys know yet
who takes over?

311
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:03,797
- What's that?
- When they send the old

312
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:08,635
Battletoad off to the hoosegow?
Your dad. Admiral Grope Boat.

313
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:11,305
Um, yeah. No, he's not.
That's actually not happening.

314
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:14,057
Yeah, that's right. That's... no.
That's the line

315
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:16,435
Stick to the line that's good.

316
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:45,172
So according to Steven
my prison consultant, this is...you know

317
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:49,301
This is kind of what the food is like inside.
I'm in training How's your omelette?

318
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:56,558
Nice. Nope.
Yeah. Making some inroads

319
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,061
- I'm actually glad you called, Tom.
- It's like... it's like Afghanistan

320
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:02,064
You have to start in the center there.
You establish a base of operations

321
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:04,191
And you have to kind of move out

322
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:06,276
- To secure more territory.
- Okay.

323
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:10,239
Yeah. I, uh... I'm worried
about prison. I... I... I...

324
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:12,741
I just feel, because of my physical length

325
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:15,535
I could be a target for all
kinds of misadventure.

326
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:18,956
And it won't taste as good
as this either, okay?

327
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:24,336
You have to take off 30% to 50% of the taste
of that endless salty gym mat

328
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:26,505
That you're eating. The camel's labia.

329
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,716
Yeah. Like they wipe their
ass on your pillowcase.

330
00:22:29,841 --> 00:22:31,551
Yeah. I know. I know.
That's something they like to do.

331
00:22:31,677 --> 00:22:34,930
I've read the prison blogs, Greg. I know.

332
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,559
look. You know how, uh

333
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:42,813
They're calling you that name
around the office?

334
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:44,856
The... you know the Christmas tree?

335
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:47,609
What's good is to eradicate hope

336
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:50,570
They can't get you if you got no hope.

337
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:55,075
It's because I think you know
If you have a crime you need to unload

338
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,536
They can hang it from you
like an ornament.

339
00:22:57,661 --> 00:23:00,289
I haven't really slept properly
in about eight days.

340
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:05,002
It's not a nice name,
but I was wondering since

341
00:23:05,127 --> 00:23:08,422
I mean, it looks like you're going anyway

342
00:23:09,381 --> 00:23:15,512
Is it.. is it possible you might... with me?

343
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:18,432
Are you asking if you can...

344
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:23,812
Hook your bauble of corporate
wrongdoing on one of my branches, Greg?

345
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:28,191
I just thought if... if it won't
make much difference to you...

346
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:37,951
Fine. Okay. Load me up, you piece of shit.

347
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:41,496
No quid pro quo? Just...

348
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:48,128
That's... that's incredibly kind of you.

349
00:23:53,216 --> 00:23:56,345
- Can I get this?
- No. Greenpeace stole your inheritance.

350
00:23:56,845 --> 00:24:00,349
Besides, all my meals will be free soon, so...

351
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:14,321
Okay, Mr. Roy.
Is there any other illegal conduct

352
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:17,949
that you are aware of in connection
to what we've been talking about today

353
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:19,910
That we haven't covered?

354
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:28,794
No. Not that I can think of now...
at the moment.

355
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,173
Thank you for your time, Mr. Roy.
Counselor. Thank you.

356
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:35,133
Thank you.

357
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:46,937
Good. I think that you did fine.

358
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:52,275
It was a good start
and they'll have another session.

359
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:54,528
We can say it went badly, Lisa. It's okay.

360
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:57,114
Okay. Let's maybe just...
we'll do the Monday morning

361
00:24:57,364 --> 00:24:59,116
- quarterback in a bit.
- They spent all day trying to find...

362
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:01,576
hairline fractures in my story.

363
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:04,204
Meanwhile, my Dad's a fucking tsunami
of corruption

364
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,375
- They don't do cuddles, Ken.
- Right. Right.

365
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,168
Because I... I know how this works.

366
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:14,506
Okay? My dad is drowning them
In chicken feed and compliance bullshit

367
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:16,550
Five years go by and it... and it's

368
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:19,553
"Hey, whatever happened to that
big investigation into the bad people?"

369
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:21,930
- Ken...
- Because they are scared of my dad.

370
00:25:22,055 --> 00:25:25,267
- Come on. Come on.
- They pretend they're on the side of justice

371
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:26,852
They pretend they're on the side
of the whistleblowers.

372
00:25:26,977 --> 00:25:28,687
- Not here.
- But they're chickenshit.

373
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:30,730
Not here.

374
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:37,737
That should put a rocket up their asses.

375
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,707
We do not want this to get politicized.

376
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:51,668
- Well, everything is politics, so...
- Kendall.

377
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:57,507
- Do you think you're smarter than me?
- What? Do I... what? No. No.

378
00:25:58,008 --> 00:26:00,635
Because maybe you are.
But I am a better lawyer

379
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,888
You acted high handed and defensive

380
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:05,765
and then oscillated to wildly over
familiar and glib.

381
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,601
You sometimes undermined my status

382
00:26:07,726 --> 00:26:10,854
And didn't appear to be frank
about your own involvement

383
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,649
But let's take stock, okay?

384
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:27,871
- Hey, Logan.
- Dave. How are we?

385
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:29,831
Good. Good. I'm glad I ran into you.

386
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,043
I feel like we've hardly
had a chance to connect.

387
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,420
- Well, here we are.
- Here we are.

388
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:39,257
You've heard they're calling this
the ATN primary?

389
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:42,469
Oh, I wouldn't worry about all that.

390
00:26:43,595 --> 00:26:48,683
You know, one of the things
I wanted to discuss with you is...

391
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:54,147
Is Controlling Tech.
That's a big... big plank for me.

392
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:57,192
Oh, that's interesting.
That's really interesting.

393
00:26:57,442 --> 00:27:02,531
Sure. Sure. Uh, and I...
I can sometimes fear a degree Of...

394
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:05,575
legal overreach against you legacy media guys.

395
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,830
You heard this thing that the deputy
AG has a dartboard with my face on it?

396
00:27:10,956 --> 00:27:16,044
Yeah. I mean, I think
that's just a rumor.

397
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:19,047
I mean, to me, it's one of those
things where even if it isn't real

398
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:21,967
there's a reason it feels like it is, right?

399
00:27:25,554 --> 00:27:28,515
- Right.
- Okay. Good.

400
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,725
Look, I'm just gonna be straight with you

401
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,729
I like you. Petkus and the big dollar guys
are on the fence.

402
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:37,440
Let's... let's... let's make this
happen, yeah?

403
00:27:37,566 --> 00:27:41,152
I just need you
to push me over the brink here.

404
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,698
Great. I get it. See you at dinner.

405
00:27:48,326 --> 00:27:53,123
I think he's been waiting there
for me for the last ten fucking minutes.

406
00:27:54,165 --> 00:27:55,750
Okay. Okay. Okay.

407
00:27:55,875 --> 00:28:00,422
So Comfry, Lisa's out. It turns out
she's a toxic person, you know

408
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:02,299
And once... once I get
the new legal A team in place

409
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:05,385
We gotta put that out
with the right context, okay?

410
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,846
- Okay.
- Yeah, it's not a big deal.

411
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:11,099
It's an opportunity We just... we just,
you know, flip a big name, boom

412
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:13,476
- It's all good. It's all good.
- Totally. All right. Cool.

413
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:15,020
I will tell Berry.

414
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:19,149
Okay, guys. B Day. Big... big... big
4...0. How we looking?

415
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:21,526
- Shit slaps.
- Yeah? You think?

416
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,111
What was the one...
what was the one I liked?

417
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:25,071
- What's the one I liked?
- Uh, End Times?

418
00:28:25,238 --> 00:28:27,616
- Right.
- Weimar meets Carthage meets Dante

419
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:32,037
meets AI, And antibiotic resistant superbugs.

420
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:33,538
That's kind of dope though.

421
00:28:33,663 --> 00:28:37,751
I mean, but are Zadie Smith
and fucking Chuck D and Lucas Madison

422
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:42,672
Gonna come to my antibiotics party?
I don't know. Will he meet?

423
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:47,052
- He's not picking up any of our numbers.
- Okay. Well, get me new numbers.

424
00:28:47,177 --> 00:28:49,179
- Okay.
- Just... let's keep calling.

425
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:51,931
- He is priority one, Jess.
- Yeah.

426
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:58,480
Well, my grandpa gave
my inheritance to Greenpeace

427
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:00,732
And then someone
posted a comment on their website

428
00:29:00,857 --> 00:29:03,401
And it could contain
a slight on my character.

429
00:29:03,526 --> 00:29:06,071
And then Greenpeace
promoted the comment

430
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:10,659
And so my lawyer thinks
that that's defamation.

431
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,079
So yeah, that... that's how
I'm trying to sue Greenpeace.

432
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:17,791
- Is that Shiv Roy?
- Oh, Mr. Salgado.

433
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:21,294
Good to see you here. Does this mean
you've finally come to your senses?

434
00:29:21,628 --> 00:29:24,214
Oh, no. Just shopping
in the marketplace of ideas.

435
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:26,257
Step on in Shiv, the water's fine.

436
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:31,137
Hey, I don't mean to bum Rush you here,
but could you help me out?

437
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:34,224
There's a feeding frenzy
around your dad and I'm...

438
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:37,977
- trying To stand apart from the rest of it
- The total fucking wack jobs?

439
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,107
Don't get me wrong. I'm with the base.
Energy is extraordinary.

440
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:46,069
I just think I can bring traditional
conservatives to a more diverse dialogue.

441
00:29:47,028 --> 00:29:49,364
ATN hasn't given you a lot of shine.
It's true.

442
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:52,575
Not to be indiscreet but, um, I just feel...

443
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:58,665
If I was in the White House and you were
in the C suite, we could mold.

444
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:03,420
- Oh, wow. Sir, you are very forward.
- Was that forward?

445
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,799
Get your old man to make me President
I'll see to it that you become CEO

446
00:30:07,924 --> 00:30:09,676
Even if I have to send your dad to prison.

447
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:13,263
Well, that is, uh, that's very funny.

448
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:17,767
So it's decided? You land this
for me, I send your dad up the river?

449
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:21,146
Uh, yeah. I mean, unless...
unless he resigns in a month.

450
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:22,647
Clean kill, baby!

451
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:26,651
Good stuff. Okay. Very funny.

452
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:33,491
Look, you want some advice?
Hoard mackerel tins

453
00:30:33,658 --> 00:30:35,034
I know. Sounds funny, right?

454
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,121
But you're gonna need them for bartering.

455
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:40,165
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

456
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:43,168
- Greg, can you... will you keep a note?
- Oh, yeah.

457
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:48,673
Oh, and the toilet. Your toilet
is your stair machine, it's your bench

458
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:54,763
It's, uh, your fridge, it's your lover,
It's your brother, it's your priest.

459
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:58,767
Oh, and also, most importantly
it's also your toilet.

460
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:03,188
Right. Right. Right. Yeah.
That... That... I mean, that's...Yeah

461
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:04,856
That's... So that's a big part of prison.

462
00:31:06,483 --> 00:31:10,278
It can be a perfect gentleman.
It could also be a terrible bastard.

463
00:31:10,403 --> 00:31:11,780
Your toilet could be a bastard?

464
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:16,993
The key is unity. If we land a favorite,
I can pool the big money.

465
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:20,914
But I need to know the messaging
will be there to back me up

466
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:25,335
I like him, but a lot of people
are asking, "Is Boyer a fighter?"

467
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,505
I don't care about the resume
or ideological purity

468
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,509
As long as they get it and they pop.

469
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:35,094
You're looking for someone
who gets it, I got your man

470
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:40,892
Connor Roy. He's got a brand name,
a war chest, populist appeal

471
00:31:41,017 --> 00:31:43,269
- And he's a fighter.
- Hey, thanks, Pete

472
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:46,648
I believe I speak for my father
when I offer a firm

473
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:49,818
And robust, "No comment!"

474
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:57,367
- Sure. I could see Connor.
- Sure, I agree.

475
00:31:57,617 --> 00:32:00,829
The sword has been pulled
from the stone, my liege.

476
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:04,249
Look at us playing nice
people might think we liked each other.

477
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:07,335
- No, What?
- Hey, I'm a conservative, I like tradition

478
00:32:07,585 --> 00:32:11,464
I doff my cap to Vice President Boyer's
years of loyal service.

479
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:15,301
Thank you. I believe you used
to call me "Martin Van Boring"?

480
00:32:15,426 --> 00:32:17,720
Hey, come on, no. I still call you that.

481
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:20,640
Mencken and I may differ in some areas

482
00:32:20,765 --> 00:32:24,686
But, uh, we both agree that this
is the party of the working class now.

483
00:32:25,645 --> 00:32:29,774
What? Shiv, all the richest counties
in America are blue

484
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:33,069
The Democrats and Tech hold all the wealth.

485
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:36,447
I just think some of us get
so high off owning the libs

486
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:39,617
- We forget to talk policy.
- Yeah, Rick loves to talk policy

487
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:42,829
What he does is he memorizes
a National Review issue

488
00:32:42,954 --> 00:32:45,832
From 2012 and then he recites it back to you

489
00:32:45,957 --> 00:32:48,126
- Cool policy, bro.
- And Jeryd hates to talk policy

490
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:50,461
Because it would mean, you know, having one.

491
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:54,674
- Sick burn, brosef.
- no, no. We're kidding, we like each other.

492
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,094
I listen to his speeches every night.
They help me drop off.

493
00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:01,347
Maybe it's boring talking about
populist solutions for working families.

494
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:04,726
Rick, come on, you jerked off
to Reagan's headshot for 30 years

495
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:08,021
- And now you're Tom Joad?
- Oh, God, it's so fucking boring.

496
00:33:09,063 --> 00:33:10,690
What's that? What?

497
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:14,277
No, I just... I've seen your thing
quite a lot.

498
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:16,029
And that... and what's that?
What's my thing?

499
00:33:16,154 --> 00:33:20,450
YouTube provocateur bullshit
Aristo... populism, rape is natural.

500
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:24,495
"It's all red pill, baby."
I'm just... I'm just so fucking over it.

501
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:26,205
Have you read Plato?

502
00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:31,878
- Yeah. Remind me, what happens?
- Read Plato! Read Plato!

503
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:34,422
Oh, don't want to!
Don't fucking want to!

504
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:36,716
See, he doesn't actually
wanna have a conversation

505
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:38,718
- He just wants to yell Loud enough
- Yeah

506
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:41,262
- to get on ATN.
- Nah. Fuck ATN.

507
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:45,850
No, really. ATN is treated
as a bulwark, but it's dead.

508
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:50,271
It's basically a pudding cup at 5:00 PM
in the nursing home.

509
00:33:52,273 --> 00:33:54,317
Honestly, doesn't speak to me.

510
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:57,403
Doesn't speak to the...
the people that I talk to.

511
00:33:57,737 --> 00:34:02,700
It is status quo bedtime stories
to maximize Shareholder value.

512
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:07,497
No disrespect, Logan Roy was an icon

513
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:11,125
But, you know... he's no longer relevant.

514
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:14,420
- You recognize this fucker?
- Nope.

515
00:34:15,004 --> 00:34:18,383
Fucking jelly bone... bow tea
"pip, pip, cheerio" fucker.

516
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:21,886
- You told Dad yet?
- No. We have to stop the wedding now, right?

517
00:34:22,053 --> 00:34:24,138
What? Stop obsessing over
Mom's new husband

518
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:27,433
- Just get over it. Who cares?
- Get over it? It just fucking happened

519
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,020
Our mother is marrying some dickhead
crooked tooth turnip man

520
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:32,522
What's wrong Is how little
you care about it,

521
00:34:32,647 --> 00:34:34,023
- you frozen bitch.
- Poor Rome. His dreams

522
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:37,402
of porking mom slipping through
his little lubed up fingers.

523
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:43,408
Hey. So, come in. Come in.

524
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:46,202
- Yeah.
- Sit. Sit.

525
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:48,246
Is Greg necessary?

526
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,999
Just keep your trap shut. Watch.

527
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:55,336
All right. Thank you, sir.
Minimizing the Greg window.

528
00:34:55,628 --> 00:34:58,756
There's a lot of chaff flying by,
a lot of flapping

529
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:03,469
But Ron and me are gonna meet and figure
out how we can pull for the same name

530
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,515
We need one voice on this,
or we could fall apart

531
00:35:08,016 --> 00:35:10,351
and hand it to the fuck... Fuck donkey gang.

532
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:15,732
Right. So... Who do we like?

533
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:19,527
Well, shouldn't we kick it around a bit?

534
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:23,406
You know, it feels like it's poised
so if you and Petkus come together

535
00:35:23,531 --> 00:35:25,450
And then the other donors follow,

536
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:26,951
- then it's...
- Exactly.

537
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,580
We're picking. We haven't got all night.

538
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,498
I like Connor Roy.

539
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:39,464
Honestly, Dad I think you go Dems.
Yeah, I do

540
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:43,843
- Jesus Christ.
- I kinda like Mencken,

541
00:35:43,968 --> 00:35:48,347
but I know he's kind of shitty
So if it's now I guess, Boyer

542
00:35:48,473 --> 00:35:51,017
But can I just say, I don't like Boyer

543
00:35:51,142 --> 00:35:53,019
- What? What's with the fucking...
- Roman, no disrespect,

544
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:56,564
but Boyer's yesterday's papers The Dems
will run on change and blow him away.

545
00:35:56,689 --> 00:35:59,609
Mrs. Politics? How many big races
did you win as a consultant?

546
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:01,402
- Four, three? Two? Did you win two?
- Roman, Boyer is not a winner

547
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:04,197
- And we know that.
- One? Well, then should we talk to Mencken

548
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:08,242
- see if we can deal?
- The base does like him? Right?

549
00:36:13,664 --> 00:36:15,833
Look, can I say something?

550
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:22,548
No. Mencken is an integralist
Nativist fuckhead. He's toxic.

551
00:36:22,673 --> 00:36:25,134
He's "Medicare for all abortions for none."

552
00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:28,429
And his idea of diplomacy
is shooting roe deer with Viktor Orban

553
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:30,264
And then starting a trade war with China

554
00:36:30,473 --> 00:36:32,475
Look, I'm tough I know that there's
the carnival bark

555
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,229
And then there's the fucking show but he is
outside the American political tradition.

556
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:41,609
And I think we have a responsibility as
Waystar to the American Republic

557
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:45,404
- And to the future of... fuck you, Roman.
- Four score years and whatever...

558
00:36:45,655 --> 00:36:47,198
- No, he has talked about...
- My sister did bring forth

559
00:36:47,323 --> 00:36:49,450
- from her bedroom a cup of milky sputum.
- You done?

560
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,994
- Yeah, done.
- He's talked about burning Qurans

561
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,789
- and licensing press credentials.
- He's just shifting the Overton window

562
00:36:54,914 --> 00:36:56,833
- It's not burning Qurans. I do
- I'm surprised you even What that is.

563
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,168
He's opening it and throwing
union organizers out of it.

564
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:01,796
Stop Chicken Little-ing us.
It just makes us wanna all have a nap.

565
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,423
Stop being a dirty little pixie
Whispering swastikas in Dad's ear.

566
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:06,384
Boom. There you go again.
So fucking route one.

567
00:37:06,509 --> 00:37:07,927
I'm not saying it's going to be
full Third Reich.

568
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:10,680
But I am genuinely concerned
that we could slide into...

569
00:37:11,055 --> 00:37:13,850
Into a Russian Berlusconied Brazilian
fuck pile.

570
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:16,477
You have a trophy husband
and several fur coats

571
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:19,480
- I think you're gonna be fine.
- Tom? Who do you like?

572
00:37:19,772 --> 00:37:24,110
Me, I, uh, I think Shiv...
Shiv talks a lot of sense

573
00:37:24,235 --> 00:37:26,779
- But I also jibe with Salgado.
- Oh, you jibe with him?

574
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:29,615
- Pretty sure that's racist, Tom.
- May I... sorry, do I get to vote?

575
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,993
Sure you do, buddy.
You get to vote at the election

576
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:35,163
- with all the other folks.
- Right, yeah Well, I guess I just feel like

577
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:38,291
- you maybe get a bigger vote in here
- Easy, Castro.

578
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:42,044
Boyer is likely to be flexible over the DOJ.

579
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,463
- Not if he doesn't win which he won't.
- Although,

580
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:47,008
we are hearing murmurs
that the case is weakening

581
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:51,095
And that no one big is likely to do jail time.

582
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:53,973
- Great.
- With the notable exception of Tom,

583
00:37:54,098 --> 00:37:57,101
- obviously. Sorry, Tom.
- No, please, Hugo. Understood.

584
00:37:57,226 --> 00:38:01,939
Look, if you don't go blue, Dad, then
at least we have to be backing Salgado.

585
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,566
- Boy.
- Senor Dickless.

586
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:07,570
- Captain of the Tampa Bay Cuckaneers.
- Cyd! - Sorry. Duty calls!

587
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:10,406
Look, I don't like him
he's a Neocon pretending to be a Paleocon

588
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:12,283
- But he at least talks base and...
- Hello?

589
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:13,951
Tom.

590
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:16,621
"Where are you right now?"

591
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:18,915
Virginia.

592
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:21,959
"No, where are you in the building?"

593
00:38:24,212 --> 00:38:27,048
Shiv, can I just say, and I know
that we have had our differences

594
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:30,760
But I do think you are so brave
for picking the brown man

595
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:32,762
I think that we should get you a medal
A special medal

596
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:34,555
- for white women who like brown men.
- Just a racist. just being a racist now

597
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,642
"I'm a good girl I pretend to care about
people 'cause no one cares about me!"

598
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:40,853
Oh, yeah. Actually, do you have
something you wanna tell Dad from Mom,

599
00:38:40,978 --> 00:38:43,189
a message that maybe you could share, Rome?

600
00:38:43,314 --> 00:38:46,943
Uh, yeah, wow. Fuck you.
Thanks. I do. I have a message

601
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:49,779
yeah. Uh, Mom's getting remarried.

602
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:53,824
To Bertie Woofter?

603
00:38:54,158 --> 00:38:57,370
No, to Peter, um, uh, P... Uh,
Mun... Peter Munion.

604
00:38:57,495 --> 00:39:01,040
You're fucking kidding. The seat sniffer?

605
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:06,254
- He's been hanging round for 40 years.
- Yeah and, uh, she would...

606
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:09,757
They would love it apparently if you
came to their big Tuscan wedding.

607
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,637
And they sent you as messenger boy?

608
00:39:23,271 --> 00:39:24,647
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

609
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:26,691
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

610
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:33,781
Hey. So I will take
the Griddle Hero special, please

611
00:39:33,906 --> 00:39:35,700
With double hash browns, fully loaded

612
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:39,912
And a plain waffle and a... and
a large cup of room temperature water

613
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:41,455
Thank you.

614
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:46,836
I might just watch him.

615
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:49,797
You know that Rasputin would take
a dose of arsenic

616
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:53,134
With breakfast each morning
to build up his tolerance.

617
00:39:56,762 --> 00:40:03,519
Look, so... I think you know
I've always liked you Tom.

618
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:05,896
I like you too, Kendall. I mean, I have notes.

619
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,357
Oh, no. I have notes.

620
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:11,152
I think mine might
be more extensive than yours.

621
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,613
But look I think I can get you
out of this mess

622
00:40:15,156 --> 00:40:16,532
Where you're going.

623
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,828
Well, uh, nothing is certain, so...

624
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,583
You know they're calling you
the Christmas tree?

625
00:40:27,835 --> 00:40:30,629
Yeah. Perhaps that's
because I'm tall and jolly.

626
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:32,923
Maybe. You think?

627
00:40:34,342 --> 00:40:38,220
But I think maybe you don't wanna be the chit
the company offers up When it has no choice.

628
00:40:39,722 --> 00:40:44,352
Well... obviously I'd prefer
that not to happen.

629
00:40:44,852 --> 00:40:48,147
But, um, it's complicated.

630
00:40:48,272 --> 00:40:53,152
It is. But I'm here to ask, are you
interested in an alternative theoretically?

631
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:00,785
I have of late, uh, decided
not to tarry too much with hope.

632
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:07,875
Okay. Well, my case is...
It's strong, it's... no, it's...

633
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:12,963
My case is fine. It has gaps.

634
00:41:14,465 --> 00:41:17,343
But if I had someone who could say
that nothing gets signed off on

635
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:20,262
Without my dad's say so
which I think we both know to be true.

636
00:41:20,388 --> 00:41:23,099
I don't know that I do know that, Ken.

637
00:41:26,394 --> 00:41:28,646
Yeah, I'm just a humble servant, Ken.

638
00:41:34,902 --> 00:41:38,489
I admire you, man. I do.
I fucking... you know,

639
00:41:38,614 --> 00:41:40,825
you... You're... look at...
you're a long way from home.

640
00:41:42,326 --> 00:41:43,702
You're far from the tree.

641
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:49,708
You've played your hand well
and you're sitting at the top table.

642
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:52,545
Well, shucks. Thank you.

643
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:54,422
I fell in love with your sister,
that's what happened.

644
00:41:55,506 --> 00:41:58,217
Sure. Oh, yeah. Right
right, right. Sure. Sure, man.

645
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:01,679
The country mouse and the hot tamale.

646
00:42:02,596 --> 00:42:05,891
And you're just, uh... What? Just...

647
00:42:06,016 --> 00:42:10,438
I suppose you're just a long glass of water?
No agenda?

648
00:42:10,563 --> 00:42:13,816
- I guess.
- Well, here's how it goes

649
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:16,735
I have new lawyers
who are fucking amazing

650
00:42:17,653 --> 00:42:21,157
I do not underestimate the cognitive
dissonance you're experiencing

651
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:26,912
Lying, hiding. But pretty soon,
granted immunity.

652
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:31,750
And you're not going to prison.
How does that sound?

653
00:42:35,171 --> 00:42:37,131
I guess there are other names.

654
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:43,095
We have to be united on this.
It's a disaster if we splinter.

655
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:47,641
- Salgado has great narrative. Quit butt...
- Buffing Salgado, Shiv.

656
00:42:48,058 --> 00:42:50,144
We all supported your
little DC lemonade stand

657
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:51,979
But this is the fucking real world
This actually matters.

658
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:54,482
Roman, you just love the boot
because you love to be kicked by it.

659
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:59,737
- What?
- What? Nothing. No.

660
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:04,033
- What about Connor?
- Interesting.

661
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:08,078
I do believe that idea has good promise I do.

662
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:12,166
- I could see it.
- Well, if you can see it,

663
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:14,251
- should we talk about it?
- Kids?

664
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:22,468
Sure. I don't know.
Yeah. Wait, but like really?

665
00:43:25,846 --> 00:43:30,559
I guess. Sure. I don't know. They're all
fucking weirdos anyway, so why not?

666
00:43:30,684 --> 00:43:32,228
- No offense, Con.
- None taken.

667
00:43:32,353 --> 00:43:36,524
I mean, he's a good looking kid.
He's smart, in his way.

668
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:39,652
Fucking Joe Kennedy did it for his boys.

669
00:43:40,528 --> 00:43:43,572
So let's get him in there
with a smile and a shoeshine

670
00:43:43,697 --> 00:43:46,450
And get Ron and everyone behind him.

671
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:49,328
I would fight so fucking hard
for this family, Pop.

672
00:43:51,622 --> 00:43:55,543
Siobhan, as a political consultant
what do you think?

673
00:43:56,585 --> 00:43:59,171
- Come on.
- Well, okay not huge name ID,

674
00:43:59,296 --> 00:44:01,006
but the family name will be a factor and...

675
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:04,468
- A positive. One of many.
- Uh, he's got no track record.

676
00:44:04,802 --> 00:44:07,638
Nothing to beat me with. I'm a clean skin.

677
00:44:08,973 --> 00:44:12,601
And I guess, in terms
of presentation and connection skills...

678
00:44:12,726 --> 00:44:15,437
- Tick. Tick.
- He can walk and chew gum.

679
00:44:16,313 --> 00:44:17,898
He pisses pretty straight.

680
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:21,902
- Pretty damn straight. I piss policy laser.
- Okay. Are we being serious about this?

681
00:44:22,111 --> 00:44:25,030
We're talking about trying
to make Connor President

682
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:27,575
Of the United States of America, Crap Pants.

683
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,952
Roman, it's a big tent.
Why don't you just come in?

684
00:44:30,077 --> 00:44:32,913
Sure. I might call the guy
who waxes my balls, he's a possible.

685
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,456
- Jesus.
- Greg.

686
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:38,586
Would you vote for Connor?

687
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:43,507
- Me? Would I? Um...
- Honestly?

688
00:44:43,632 --> 00:44:47,636
Honestly, uh, yeah. I... I...
it depends. I... I think...

689
00:44:49,388 --> 00:44:53,058
I think I could see myself
spoiling my ballot in his favor

690
00:44:53,225 --> 00:44:55,769
it... depending on the opposition. Yeah.

691
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:58,063
What do you think, Shiv? Is it nuts?

692
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:00,524
I love Con, I do. But...

693
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:05,154
If we're talking about this seriously
I think we have to look at Salgado

694
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:06,947
- Can I bring him up here?
- Oh, come on.

695
00:45:07,865 --> 00:45:09,783
Hugo, call Boyer.

696
00:45:10,117 --> 00:45:14,330
Okay. If she's bringing up Soggy Salgado
Then I wanna see if we can tame Mencken. Okay?

697
00:45:14,496 --> 00:45:17,249
- Oh, for fuck sake.
- Speakerphone.

698
00:45:20,377 --> 00:45:26,925
- "Hello?"
- Hi. Dave, it's Logan. How are you?

699
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,012
"Good, Logan. how are you?"

700
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:33,974
I'm fine. We're all fine.
I'm here in my suite.

701
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:38,395
- Would you fancy stopping by?
- "it's pretty late, Logan."

702
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:44,652
"But sure. Sure."

703
00:45:44,818 --> 00:45:50,074
Great. Great. And Dave, listen
my fridge is bare

704
00:45:50,991 --> 00:45:52,951
I don't suppose
you could run me over a Coke?

705
00:45:54,453 --> 00:45:56,080
"Did you mean to call room service?"

706
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:00,417
If you don't have a Coke
is there something else?

707
00:46:01,502 --> 00:46:02,961
"Yes."

708
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:06,340
Could you fire the Deputy Attorney General?

709
00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:11,053
"Fire the deputy attorney general?"

710
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:20,729
I'm kidding. Come on over.
Have a chat if it's convenient.

711
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:23,440
"Sure, I'll be over in a few minutes."

712
00:46:24,024 --> 00:46:26,777
Thank you, Hugo. Take the boy and go.

713
00:46:27,903 --> 00:46:32,950
Yeah, yeah. I will go. I just wanna say
I think,

714
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:40,958
I think I owe it to my country to say.
I don't think you should crown

715
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:46,338
Or make Connor president
That's it. Thank you. Goodnight. Sorry.

716
00:46:48,465 --> 00:46:50,134
So what do you think?

717
00:46:57,099 --> 00:46:58,726
- Let me think.
- Yeah. Take your time.

718
00:46:58,851 --> 00:47:00,394
- I see. It's tough for you.
- Yeah.

719
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:05,399
You know, my dad seems powerful,
Shiv seems safe

720
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:07,317
But...

721
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:13,782
I don't know. You think she'll still be there
waiting for you after prison?

722
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:20,998
How exactly does it work if I...
if I do come over to you?

723
00:47:21,707 --> 00:47:26,587
I mean, how... how is it better
for me when I tell my wife

724
00:47:27,463 --> 00:47:31,925
Whom I love, and this family,
that I'm turning against them? How?

725
00:47:34,011 --> 00:47:36,722
She'll respect you
Tell her, "What's she doing?"

726
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:41,351
Bring her over, Logan goes down
Shiv knows who the fucking man is

727
00:47:44,104 --> 00:47:45,564
Come on, man.

728
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:50,360
But hav... and I don't mean to be insulting,
but having been around a bit

729
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:57,451
My hunch is that you're going to get fucked

730
00:47:58,035 --> 00:48:00,704
Because I've seen you get fucked a lot

731
00:48:01,038 --> 00:48:03,123
And I've never seen Logan get fucked once.

732
00:48:15,969 --> 00:48:17,763
Nice. Classy.

733
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:23,101
Yeah. Okay, I gotta go.

734
00:48:23,727 --> 00:48:25,312
Do you know what they're doing
up in his suite?

735
00:48:27,564 --> 00:48:29,191
They're picking the next president.

736
00:48:51,672 --> 00:48:56,134
Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg
Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg...

737
00:48:56,552 --> 00:48:58,178
Fuck Greenpeace!

738
00:48:59,263 --> 00:49:05,227
- Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg.
- Okay. Okay. Uh, okay.

739
00:49:19,783 --> 00:49:23,620
"Obviously, we take the integrity
of the Justice Department very seriously"

740
00:49:23,787 --> 00:49:28,292
But there is always the question
of overreach. So yeah, on tech"

741
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,671
I mean the strategy is clear.
I hear you about GoJo

742
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:38,051
I personally don't think there
would be any regulatory issues.

743
00:49:39,887 --> 00:49:45,976
Well, thank you, Dave.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

744
00:49:46,685 --> 00:49:48,896
You've, uh, given us a lot to think about.

745
00:49:49,229 --> 00:49:50,898
- Great to see you again.
- You, too.

746
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,818
Wonderful to see you again,
my very good adversary.

747
00:49:58,322 --> 00:50:01,825
So, just wanted to chitchat a little bit
That was funny earlier, you know?

748
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:05,996
You tripping the light fantastic
on grandpappy's nut sack.

749
00:50:06,163 --> 00:50:09,166
And when I called your dad bullshit?
I mean, did that bump?

750
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:10,751
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Never heard that before.

751
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:12,502
Like, that was, like hardcore and junk.

752
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,548
- 'Cause the thing is this monkey don't dance.
- This monkey right here?

753
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:18,675
This dancing monkey
in dad's bathroom doesn't dance?

754
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,177
That's right.

755
00:50:23,138 --> 00:50:28,101
So I did wanna talk to you about something.
And fuck it I'll just come out and say it

756
00:50:28,602 --> 00:50:34,107
Fascists are kind of cool, but not really
So is that like a problem, a thing?

757
00:50:35,651 --> 00:50:40,238
Seriously? Me? I just...
I don't have a lot of boundaries

758
00:50:40,822 --> 00:50:45,035
St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas
Schumacher, I'll borrow from anyone.

759
00:50:45,327 --> 00:50:50,290
And, you know, if Franco or H
or Travis Bickle had a good pitch

760
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:52,417
Fuck it, I'm a Man for All Seasons.

761
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:56,254
"H"? You know, there was
a very naughty boy named H...

762
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:01,093
I'm a fully...fledged, small D democrat
A well regulated election

763
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,471
Is a transmission frequency for God's grace.

764
00:51:04,596 --> 00:51:06,390
Holy shit. You really are a Christian,
aren't you?

765
00:51:06,515 --> 00:51:09,351
Well, no, no, no. My only thing
is like who's the stakeholder, right?

766
00:51:09,643 --> 00:51:13,438
I've been tending, you know, my little
garden for like a hundred years

767
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:17,943
And then forty new guys show
up in the back of a truck

768
00:51:18,694 --> 00:51:24,950
playing their boombox and it's put to a vote
And they decide to, uh, give my farm to them

769
00:51:25,075 --> 00:51:27,744
I mean... I'm like,
"What... So sorry, what happened?"

770
00:51:27,995 --> 00:51:30,872
Maybe you have to put in, right,
before you get to take out?

771
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:37,295
Yeah. Okay. Well then, you know
who gets to, uh, who gets to join?

772
00:51:38,088 --> 00:51:43,051
Well... people trust people who look like them
That's just a scientific fact.

773
00:51:43,176 --> 00:51:45,387
They will give more tax dollars to help them.

774
00:51:46,513 --> 00:51:51,727
Now, you can integrate new elements,
of course, but come on, man, slowly.

775
00:51:52,227 --> 00:51:56,940
- I mean, fuck! I like this country.
- Yeah.

776
00:51:57,065 --> 00:52:01,319
Let's just take a beat before we fundamentally
alter its composition.

777
00:52:02,654 --> 00:52:08,285
Yeah. And in terms of, you know
this here, there's a thing here, right?

778
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:12,122
And I get it, you're...
you're fucking 6G, and we're Betamax.

779
00:52:12,247 --> 00:52:16,293
But, you know, you need us I think.
Our news, our viewers

780
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:18,795
Those fucking almost deads
That's a big slice of pie.

781
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,966
Well, if I'm the nominee... are any
of them really gonna vote against me?

782
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:27,512
No, but, you know, it's going to be
a fucking shit show

783
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:30,098
Going into the convention.
I think you could really use our push.

784
00:52:30,307 --> 00:52:31,933
I think you could use mine.

785
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:34,978
Maybe.

786
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,276
Where are you in all this?

787
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:48,867
Me, Roman? Uh, you know...
I'm creeping on the come up.

788
00:52:48,992 --> 00:52:51,453
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I've got some ideas for ATN, you know?

789
00:52:51,578 --> 00:52:55,248
Sluice out the fucking porridge
and add some sriracha.

790
00:52:55,624 --> 00:53:00,378
Poach some of those TikTok psychos, you know?
E girls with fucking guns and JUUL pods

791
00:53:00,504 --> 00:53:03,381
You know, give me some straight shot
Blacks and Latinos

792
00:53:03,507 --> 00:53:06,093
No more of this fucking pillows and bedpans

793
00:53:06,218 --> 00:53:08,595
You know, we're strictly bone broth
and dick pills.

794
00:53:09,721 --> 00:53:12,849
Deep state conspiracy hour
but with like a fucking wink, you know, funny.

795
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:19,523
And the whole show is kinda set up
for the star, President Jeryd Mencken.

796
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:32,828
Knock, knock.

797
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:48,927
Heard you wanted one.

798
00:53:50,554 --> 00:53:53,181
- Thank you.
- Anointed with a Coke.

799
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,438
That was nice.

800
00:54:01,064 --> 00:54:05,068
- He's nice.
- He's not nice. He's not.

801
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,114
Dad, I know we came to market
to buy you a nice milk cow

802
00:54:09,364 --> 00:54:11,616
But we found ourselves a fucking T Rex, okay?

803
00:54:12,742 --> 00:54:17,581
He's box office. The guy is fucking diesel.
He's good on camera. He's fun. He'll fight.

804
00:54:18,165 --> 00:54:20,667
Viewers will eat from his hand. No downside.

805
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:22,919
Yeah. Let's just invade Poland, Dad
No downside.

806
00:54:23,044 --> 00:54:24,838
- Oh, Jesus.
- No, his chief of staff broke a kid's jaw

807
00:54:24,963 --> 00:54:28,049
- at a rally.
- If we don't come to an accommodation

808
00:54:28,175 --> 00:54:30,468
We get outflanked and we lose
the ATN dollar machine

809
00:54:30,594 --> 00:54:33,346
When we need cash to fight tech, right?
And buy GoJo.

810
00:54:34,097 --> 00:54:36,725
Shiv wants her way
I want my way, Connor wants his way

811
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,768
- So that's even. We just need...
- It's not even!

812
00:54:38,894 --> 00:54:40,312
My opinion counts for more

813
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:43,940
No, it does. It just fucking does, okay?
I know this.

814
00:54:44,065 --> 00:54:46,526
I know. People hate him.
They fucking hate this guy.

815
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:48,778
You have to look at the climate.

816
00:54:50,614 --> 00:54:57,537
Climate said I was going down.
Climate said I should just step aside.

817
00:55:00,957 --> 00:55:05,003
I guess... I'm a climate denier.

818
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:10,050
- I'm sorry, this is how it happens?
- Goodnight.

819
00:55:10,175 --> 00:55:13,803
Dad? Dad? Come on.
He's just... he's fucking dangerous.

820
00:55:16,389 --> 00:55:21,186
Definitely fucking. Looks like your
polling was off again, Shiv.

821
00:55:28,818 --> 00:55:30,445
Let's go.

822
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:42,457
So, I saw you.

823
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:47,379
Looked like you were having a whale of a time
flying on the wings of white power.

824
00:55:48,296 --> 00:55:50,590
Yeah. Yeah, I was, uh, commandeered.

825
00:55:50,882 --> 00:55:56,054
Did it feel good as the fascists
hoisted you aloft like the Stanley Cup?

826
00:55:56,388 --> 00:55:59,683
So, Mencken's gonna
take the weekend straw poll

827
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:01,935
And Petkus has confirmed he's backing.

828
00:56:02,352 --> 00:56:08,441
Good. Sunday show pushed him this morning
Well, let's see if this horse can run.

829
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:13,989
Couldn't quite seal the deal,
and here I was thinking

830
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:16,116
that you were gonna be the man
to put my dad in prison.

831
00:56:16,658 --> 00:56:18,159
- Right.
- Siobhan!

832
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:21,871
- Speak of the devil.
- You take care. Good to see you.

833
00:56:22,455 --> 00:56:24,833
- We're doing photos.
- Family photo.

834
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:29,754
- With him? No. No.
- We're all in it. Let's go.

835
00:56:31,548 --> 00:56:33,800
We've got enough people
in the shot. I'm good.

836
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,722
Get in the photo, please.

837
00:56:43,893 --> 00:56:47,772
Siobhan, are you part of this family or not?

838
00:56:51,735 --> 00:56:55,613
I'm not standing next to him.
I'll be in the photo, but not right by him.

839
00:56:58,283 --> 00:57:01,202
You win, Pinky. You win.

840
00:57:02,871 --> 00:57:05,123
You did good this weekend, son.

841
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:08,877
- Next to Congressman.
- Mr. Mencken.

842
00:57:09,127 --> 00:57:12,297
- Roman. Thank you for your great support.
- Congratulations. Very impressed.

843
00:57:12,714 --> 00:57:14,632
Siobhan.

844
00:57:17,761 --> 00:57:21,306
Okay, everybody just be casual. Relax. Smile

845
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:27,479
Little chin down, Mr. Mencken. Congressman.
And one, two, three. Great! Great!

846
00:57:27,604 --> 00:57:29,272
- Perfect. Thank you. Super.
- Good.

847
00:57:29,564 --> 00:57:31,066
Great. Okay.

848
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:37,197
Thank you. Should we get...
should we get a couple of just...
