00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,291
to some other matters
but I can pass on your thoughts.

170
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,666
What--what's he saying?

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,875
-JESS: (WHISPERS)
Do you wanna know?
-Yeah.

172
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,750
Okay. I'll tell him.

173
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,708
Uh, he says that this could get
very ugly for him.

174
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,291
You played a decent move.

175
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,583
If you were to retract

176
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,625
and say that you were unwell
and that you misspoke,

177
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,125
then maybe there's a deal here.

178
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,458
You know what?
Tell him, legally,

179
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,083
it's not wise for me
to talk to him,

180
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,000
but that I'm going to be
in contact with the government

181
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,166
and that this would be
a good moment for him
to step down.

182
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,375
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PHONE)
-Okay, he heard.

183
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,791
...that I'm gonna
grind his fucking bones

184
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,500
to make my bread.

185
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,750
Uh, he says, in that case,

186
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,750
he's going to grind up
your bones to make his bread.

187
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,333
(SIGHS) Okay?

188
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,416
Well, tell him,

189
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,166
that I'm gonna run up off
the fucking beanstalk.

190
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,791
Okay. Logan?
Yeah, he says in that case

191
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,750
he's going to run up
off the, uh, beanstalk?

192
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,666
He's kind of laughing.
But not, like, nice laughing.

193
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,416
Just tell him he should
step back and cooperate.

194
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,958
I don't want to see him
behind bars.

195

That's bullshit.

198

That's fucking
sanctimonious bullshit.

199
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,125
It was a fucking play.

200
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,708
It was a play,
it was a fucking move.

201
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,708
So, don't act like a cunt to me

202
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,375
because it won't
fucking wash!

203
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,750
Okay, bye.

204
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,708
What--what--what did he say?

205
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:56,625
-Um...
-Any actual legal or,
or physical threats?

206
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,291
-Uh--
-You know what?

207
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,833
Don't need that in my head.

208
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,416
Just put it in an e-mail
and send it to yourself,
in case it comes up.

209
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,583
LOGAN: Okay. Action stations.

210
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,833
I gave him a chance. Gerri.

211
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,000
Everyone, let's go.

212
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,500
GERRI: Okay. Great.

213
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,708
So, I suggest I call DOJ

214
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,291
and just right away
let them know

215
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,916
how horrified we were to learn
of these, um, allegations

216
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,416
and that we intend to form
a special committee

217
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,875
and we can tell them
which white shoe law firms--

218
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,041
I have ideas, we are considering
to thoroughly investigate

219
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,708
and promptly report back
their findings.

220
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,000
Right. But do we cooperate?

221
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,833
With the government? Yeah,
I think we have to cooperate.

222
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,250
I mean, we were under
pressure already--

223
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,833
Unless we don't?

224
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,041
Yeah, but real world?

225
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,250
I mean,
this is a public company.

226
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,666
We don't know what they have
or what they might get.

227
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,083
There's only one real play here.

228
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,833
And what if I don't want to pull
down my panties down so fast?

229
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,291
ROMAN: Then you pull up
the draw-bridge.

230
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,000
It's politically motivated.
"Come get us, motherfuckers."

231
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,291
What's our story?

232
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,291
The story is--is that he's
exploiting these poor women.

233
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,791
And that's very sad.

234
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,541
You were grooming him
for the top.

235
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,541
But you know?
He's a junkie and he blew it.

236
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,625
He's a bitter fuck up
that needs psychiatric help.

237
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,791
And of course
you're the big baddie,
so everybody jumped on board.

238
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,083
And what about these papers?

239
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,041
Uh, they're fake. Or stolen,

240
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,666
if they even exist. Are you
worried about the papers?

241
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,500
Hmm? We'll go after him
for corporate theft.

242
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,875
This is, you know, not nice
thing to say about your son

243
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,291
but maybe you chop him
into a million pieces
and toss him in the Hudson?

244
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,250
You destroy Kendall,
it falls apart.

245
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,375
LOGAN: What do we think?

246
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,583
How's the price?

247
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,833
Well, uh, net-net, it's steady.

248
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,541
But institutions are dumping
in case this kills us

249
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,000
and arbs are buying in case
Sandy and Stewy win.

250
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,666
Yeah,
Kendall has changed the game.

251
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,000
Noncooperation now, it's not--
it's too...

252
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,375
It's too hot out there.
I think it's very high risk.

253
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,500
Yeah, well, everything's
high risk if you're a pussy.

254
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,458
-Hey, I eat red meat. Okay?
-ROMAN: Well...

255
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,833
I'm just--the repercussions.

256
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,791
ROMAN: Yeah, but I think
you're looking too small.

257
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
We do a dance

258
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,916
and we bide our time
'til the election.

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,625
ATN anointy-nointy the Raisin
for a second term?

260
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,083
New Attorney General.
And by then,

261
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,375
this has gotten a little stale,

262
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,000
Kendall will self-destruct
because it's his favorite.

263
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,916
And this all fades
the fuck away.

264
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,041
If I stop picking at scabs,

265
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,750
saying, "Sorry,"
who knows where we'll end up.

266
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,333
Class actions from the chancers
and opportunists.

267
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,125
Admissions of wrongdoing...

268
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,291
-Billions out of the door.
-Fuck!

269
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,125
If you were to call the AG
right now and shout at him,

270
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,625
-could we find out
if that'd be okay?
-Hugo, can you find out

271
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,833
what would happen
if Logan called the AG?

272
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,666
Get the Raisin.
Let's go to the top.

273
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,250
Let's get the President.

274
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,958
But gentle. Okay?

275
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,458
Anything else?

276
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,666
Do we want to order some food?

277
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,541
Food? Swallow.
We're on saliva

278
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:51,458
and adrenaline here,
until we get on a plane.
All right?

279
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,958
No local foods.

280
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,000
I get the shits, we're fucked.

281

-Okay.

long e-fucking-nough!

308

So, the President
is basically supportive,

309
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,458
but they think
it might be best for there

310
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,625
not to be a call with you
on the White House log today.

311
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,125

a fucking private call?

00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,541
Oh, the pantsuit barnacle?

314
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,500
I got her if you wanna.

315
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,125
No. Fuck it. No.
I don't talk to the babysitter.

will be supportive,

00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,333
down this rabbit hole
of bitterness.

335
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,208
MICHELLE-ANNE:<i> Okay.</i>

336
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,750
<i>Well, you know how much</i>
<i>the President respects Logan.</i>

337
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,791
<i>Okay?</i>

338
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,750
Great. So, off the record, um...

339
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,833
what's the temperature
at Main Justice?

340
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,208
Any danger of them

341
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,958
or Southern District
going Batman on this?

342
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,083
MICHELLE-ANNE:
<i>Um, the Attorney General</i>
<i>is very smart.</i>

343

344
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,666
He'll--
he'll see through this, right?

345
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,833
MICHELLE-ANNE:<i> It's just,</i>
<i>the DAG likes to think</i>

346
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,250
<i>she's something</i>
<i>of a straight-shooter.</i>

347
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,083
<i>Marilyn's prickly.</i>

348
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,083
<i>So that's your only issue,</i>
<i>Marilyn.</i>

349
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,666
Well, maybe you should
just fire her!

350
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,916
MICHELLE-ANNE:
(SARCASTICALLY)<i> Ha, ha, ha.</i>

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,916
<i>-Justice can't do nothing.</i>
-Well, they could...

352
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,166
MICHELLE-ANNE:
<i>It's out of our hands.</i>

353
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,833
Not if you grab it.

354
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,458
Um, but look, we don't want
to fall out with him.

355
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,375
MICHELLE-ANNE:
<i>Well no, he's the president.</i>

356
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,791
GERRI: No, sure, but,
do we want to get the old guys

357
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,708
on the blower
so they can just chat for five?

358
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,333
MICHELLE-ANNE:
<i>This will all be great, Gerri.</i>

359
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,916
<i>Just find me whenever,</i>
<i>on anything, okay?</i>

360
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,291
Great, well, I appreciate
getting a read. Um, many thanks.

00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,375
Yeah. Good?

362
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,416

-Opinion shapers, A list.

375

I guess, um...

00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,250
Yeah. That's the big picture
over here at Media Monitoring.

-GREG: It's super positive.

-Super positive?
-GREG: Yeah.

The negative stuff does tend
to stick in the mind a little

00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,041
just 'cause it's quite,
uh, visceral.

Because now, we're gonna go,
it looks like

420
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,625
in the first instance,
to Sarajevo.

421
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,500
What the fuck. Sarajevo?

422
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,166

freaked him out.

423
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,541
Other places to consider.

424
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:43,625
Bahrain, Bosnia, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Maldives,

425
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,125
Morocco, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the Vatican?

426
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,416
Okay. Fuck.

427
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,083
What do all these countries
have in common?

428
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,708
They're all made up?
They're lands with dragons!

429
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,958
No, I imagine that none of them
have an extradition treaty
with the U.S.

430

-Okay. Fuck.
-You know, what I thought
we could do,

431
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,583
um, is discreetly dangle
some juicy contributor contracts

432
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,625
to the more
responsible prosecutors?

433
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,625
We're going to Sarajevo.

434
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,833

00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:14,083
-It's fine. Shut up.
-Hey. Look.

436
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,375
I'm not sure
how much cover I've got.

437
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,958
I need to talk to a lawyer
on my position.

438
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,833

439
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,875
What? Like a kind of
Layo Upton type motherfucker?

440
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,750

Like a Lisa Arthur?

-She did the hookers, right?
-She repped
the trafficked sex workers, yes.

442

to have her credibility.

three or four good women,

444
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,000

"Oh, he's going scorched earth.
Maybe he can fight this."

447
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,875
We get Lisa,
people will be like,

448
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,708
"Gee, maybe this is bullshit."

449
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:52,541

She's a friend.

453
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,625
-Could you get her for me?
-SHIV: I don't know. I mean,

454
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,833
she fucking loves winning
and she loves money. So, uh...

455
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:06,500
-Listen. Listen.
-I don't... know.

456
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,166
Cooperate or not,

457
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,833
to keep the board sweet,

458
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,833
I may need to step back
a little.

459
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,958
Okay. Oh, well then,
who would--

460
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:19,666
I don't want to go back
right now. Does that play?

461
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,958
Yeah, I mean, I just--
I, I want you safe.

462
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,500
-That's the most
important thing.
-Yeah.

463
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,916
Okay. Okay, okay, uh,

464
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,750

are gonna go back

465
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,416
to manage New York.

466
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,541
No need for me
to go running back

467
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,541
like a slapped girl, looks weak.

468
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,333
-Great! Another plane.
-Want me to go?

469
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,958
No, no, no. I don't trust you.

470
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:47,875

been rerouted to Sarajevo.

477
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,000
It's ready to go. And, uh,
I will get another plane.

478
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,791
(CLEARS THROAT) Uh, Logan?
Do you need...

479
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,666
-Oh, Con?
-This guy? Yeah.

480
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,333
-Con, yes, yes, yes.
Very important.

481
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:20,291
Can you hold the fort here?
Can you keep this all secure?

482
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,458
You mean hold down the Balkans
with just two divisions?

483
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,875
I can try.

484
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:31,125

Have a good trip.

486
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:36,208

and they wanna know

487
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,375
if we wanna do
a marketing push with the play.

488
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,875
-Okay.
-You know?

489
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,750
The whole hate watch angle,

490
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:45,375
uh, you know, like, pick out
all the worst reviews

491
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,166
like, you know, "Kill yourself
if you got a ticket,"

492
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,458
or the one about brain poison.

493
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,708
Yeah, okay, I know
all of them, Con. Thank you.

494
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,833
-That's so sweet.
-Right. So, jump on
the irono-cycle

495
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,958
and, uh, make it into a thing

496
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,208
for the hipsters
and the dipshits.

497
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:00,125
-WILLA FERREYRA: Oh.
-We could make
a nice little return.

498
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:05,375
Mm-hmm. Sure. Yeah, I mean.
Yeah. That sounds exciting.

499
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:06,875
CONNOR ROY: Yeah?

500
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:10,083
Hey, so,
we'll talk about things...

501
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,833
-when we get back, right?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

502

-Of course. Yeah, okay.
So, yeah.

503
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:19,416
-You know, 'cause I love you.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Thanks.

504
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:21,208
Thank you.

505
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,541
And, uh... Yeah, don't...

506
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,416
You'll see him again.

507
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,666
Well, yeah, obviously
I'll see him again, Tom.

508
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,375
-Why would you say that?
-I'm being nice, Shiv.

509
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:34,958
If you're worried
that he won't come home,

510
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,500
I think that's unlikely.
Okay, so...

511
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,875
Well, I know that.

512
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:41,041
Okay. Great. It's fine.

513
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,875
-SHIV: Okay.
-TOM: Okay.

514
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,875
Oh, did Ken call you?

515
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:48,958
Ken? Me? No.
No, no, no.

516
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,875
Not to speak. No.
Why, did he call you?

517
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:52,291
-No.
-TOM: No.

518
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,833
No. No, I was just wondering.

519
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:58,500
-Okay. Well, look after him.
-Okay.

to do a few calls?

it's been in the mail.

It has been in the mail.

549
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,958
You know, like you always said,
it was either this

550
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:33,041
or, you know, go to Mount Athos
and become a monk.

551

-Oh, yeah. This monastery
on Mount Athos.
-Mount Athos.

552

That, that, that could have been
a more logical choice.

for meetings.

to see you and the kids.

559
00:27:58,416 --> 00:27:59,666

00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:10,416
I've been up against it
at work but...

-people were saying
you did great.
-KENDALL: Oh. Yeah.

it was fine, whatever.

I'm talking to Lisa Arthur.

00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:32,250
But--and I'm not saying
that I agree with that,

824
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,541
but, you know, um...

825
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:39,541
maybe a couple of years under
the wing of an older, uh... hen,

826
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:43,333
could, you know, see me crack
out of the old egg.

827
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,750
<i>And, um, I gotta, I gotta say,</i>

828
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,583
I know that you've been sweet
on Shiv,

829
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:51,625
and I love her, like a brother.
(NERVOUS GIGGLE)

that it's time, you know?

And all bitterness aside,

832
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,500
I do wonder
if maybe it isn't Gerri time.

833
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:04,750

<i>let the stone-cold bitch do it.</i>

it ain't Romey time, then, uh...

Yeah, I'm thinking about
my own position here.

888
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:41,916
And to be honest,
I could do with a friend.

with legal training.

who can help me navigate

894

But that's not the kind of role
I normally take on.

895
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,166
I know, I know, but, uh,

896
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,083
honestly, Lis, I got
nowhere to fucking turn here.

897
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:04,000
You know my husband
is a player in this.

898
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:05,791
And, uh, in one world,

899
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:08,791
there's, uh, I'm in a position
to come out here as CEO.

900
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:13,166
Or I might have to leave the
firm to protect my reputation.

what my dad did,
and I don't know

and I don't know
what the firm did.

I don't know. I have a plan...

906
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:27,958
but I could easily get crushed
between these two fucking men,

907
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:30,500
and I need to game things out,
and I need to do that

any confidential information.

-RAVA: Yeah.

And, and also just, um...

993
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:58,791
as an FYI, is it cool if
Naomi Pierce comes up?

-Sure, is she the Pierce...
-She's the...

995
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:03,125
Yeah, you know, we have
a little thing...

-Yeah, yeah. Fine. I heard.
-KENDALL: ...going.

997
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:08,000
It's not weird?
She, she's kind of good for me.

998
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:11,250
-No, sure. Yeah.
-KENDALL: Thank you.

999
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:14,583
-Look at us, huh? Huh?
-I know.

1000
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:19,208
Also, I saw the razors, so...

1001
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:22,083
-What?
-The razors in your bathroom?

1002
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,291
-Whose are those?
-Wait--wh--

1003
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:25,583
Why were you in my bathroom?

1004
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,208
Because I don't like to drop
a deuce where the staff go.

1005
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:32,166
Yeah. Oh, God. Ken,
uh, those don't actually mean...

1006
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,375
-Oh, no? Male razors?
-What... no!

1007
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,583
Uh, they're less expensive.

1008
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:39,375
Oh, so I'm not giving you
enough money

1009
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,125
for gender-appropriate razors
now?

1010
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:43,083
Ken, I'm not having this
conversation right now.

1011
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,291
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1012
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:46,000
-This isn't that conversation.
-RAVA: It's funny. Good.

1013
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,333
-Hey, Ken.
-Yeah?

1014
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:48,958
Uh, Lisa and Keith are here.

-LISA: Hey, Ken.
-Hey, hey, Team Genius!

1016
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:53,416
-Thank you for coming.
-My pleasure.

1017
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,458
Keith, Kendall.
Please sit.

1018
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:58,166
Uh, can I,
can I get you anything?

1019
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,458
-No, I'm good. Thank you.
-You're good? You sure?

1020
00:52:00,541 --> 00:52:02,791
Rav, it'll just be
four or five hours.

1021
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:05,833
-Uh, yeah, fine.
-Okay, hey. Here she is.

1022
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:07,416
-Hi.
-Hello.

1023
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,208
KENDALL:
Look what the Aegean dragged in.

1024
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:13,916
Okay, I'm right in the middle--
So, I want to introduce you.

1025
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,250
This is Rava. Rava, Naomi.

1026
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,708
RAVA: Hey. Hi.

1027
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:20,625
So good to meet you.

1028
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:23,041
And thank you for this.

1029
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:25,958
Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, not at all.

1030
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:28,250
I just gotta--I gotta...

1031
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:30,541
-KENDALL: Me too. Hey, Greg,
can you help, uh...
-GREG: Yeah?

1032
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:33,916
-...Naomi, I gotta... Yeah.
-GREG: Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

1033
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:35,708
So...

1034
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:39,375
He's still in Europe.
He's scared.

1035
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:43,291
And it looks like
my dad's gone to Sarajevo.

1036
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:46,333
Okay. So, I should, um,
make it clear

1037
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:48,333
this is just a preliminary.

1038
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:49,791
So, no confidential information.

1039
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,416
Sure. Sure. Well, look,
what can I tell you?

1040
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,125
Uh... my dad's the devil.

1041
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:57,708
He runs a crime ring,
and I would love to hire you

1042
00:52:57,791 --> 00:52:59,000
because you're a super star

1043
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:00,583
and I think you can take down
my dad,

1044
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:02,083
and this will be the case
of the century

1045
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:05,000
-and the highlight
of your career.
-Okay. Okay.

1046
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:06,750
-Well, that might be--
-KENDALL: I'm serious.

1047
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,375
They'll make a movie about you.

1048
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:09,666
We should make a movie
about you.

1049
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,125
Mm-hmm. And how would that look?

1050
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:13,750
It would look amazing,
because it would be brilliant!

1051
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:17,291
Okay, look, this is quite
a complex situation to progress

1052
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:19,875
because, as I understand it,
you want to take down your dad

1053
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:22,208
-without implicating yourself?
-Correct.

1054
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:23,916
And without damaging
the company to the extent

1055
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,083
that you lose control
at your shareholder meeting?

1056
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:31,791
-Correct.
-And you know that Shiv and I
have had a friend relationship?

1057
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,791
Yeah, well, that might
work out anyway.

1058
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:36,625
Okay, well, that's for you two,
but first things.

1059
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:39,125
Has the government reached out
to you yet?

1060
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,958
Or have you received a subpoena
for the documents yet?

1061
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:43,416
No, no. And look, to be clear,

1062
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,666
I will do whatever you tell me
to do.

1063
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,791
I am your puppet.

1064
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:49,791
LISA: Okay. Well, in the first
instance, we need to make sure

1065
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:52,916
you're in the clear
with your friends
at one, Saint Andrew's.

1066
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,583
-Right.
-LISA: So, first thing is
to make sure

1067
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,416
your head isn't on the block,
okay, puppet?

1068
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,500
Lisa, I feel like
you're my lawyer!

1069
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:03,625
RAVA: Oh, for fuck's sake!
Greg! What the fuck?

1070
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,833
-Be right back.
-Ken!

1071
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:06,250
-Jess, can you...
-Yep.

1072
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:07,416
RAVA: Ken!

1073
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,916
-GREG: I'm so sorry.
-KENDALL: Yeah. I'm right here.

1074
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,458
RAVA: I'm sorry, did you not
see that there was dust all over
the bottle?

1075
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,916
-We okay?
-RAVA: Did you not think to--

1076
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:16,666
-No, it's fine.
-I really had no--
I'm really sorry, Rava.

1077
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,583
-RAVA: It is fine.
-What?

1078
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:22,000
That was one
my godfather gave me.

1079
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:23,500
Naomi told me to open it, Ken.

1080
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:24,666
-Oh.
-And so I just...

1081
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,708
-Well, I'm very sorry, Rava.
-I'm so sorry.

1082
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:28,000
-RAVA: Greg, that's not...
-Hi.

1083
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:31,041
-Hey.
-Hey, ooh, sorry.

1084
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:33,458
No, no, no.
Guys, drink it, enjoy it.

1085
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:36,041
-GREG: I don't want any
personally--
-It's fine! It's good.

1086
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:38,625
It's like when someone breaks
something beautiful

1087
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,166
and it reminds you
that nothing lasts.

1088
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:43,875
Enjoy it.

1089
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:49,083
I'll get some napkins.

1090
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,916
All these brilliant
fucking women, Greg.

1091
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,291
-I mean...
-Hey, I must be doing
something right.

1092
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,625
-Right? Right?
-You are.

1093
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,291
You're doing everything right,
man.

1094
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,125
You are on top of the world.

1095
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:07,958
Okay. Uh, I'll be back
in a flash.

1096
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:11,750

you got my undivided attention.

-I'm trying.

news might have leaked.

1099
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:21,458
-And I got Simon
on the board lined up.
-LOGAN: Uh-huh.

1100
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:24,291
-Do you want a room?
-Yes, I want a fucking room!

1101
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,583
I'm about to eat dick for three
hours straight,

1102
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:30,541
so, yes, Hugo,
I would like a fucking room.

-Nothing, tell you later.

-It's not a big deal.

1110

Lisa Arthur is going
to represent Kendall.

1111

Huh.
