1
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,710
- Wow, really?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:11,837
- It's a shit show over there apparently.
- Yeah?

3
00:00:11,962 --> 00:00:16,258
Yeah. Like, advertisers bailing, my dad
is out of it, by all accounts.

4
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,719
You know, Gerri Kellman in charge?

5
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:23,641
Sorry. I mean, Gerri's great,
I actually I actually love Gerri, you know,

6
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,853
but Gerri is a time server
who's way out of her depth.

7
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,647
Meanwhile, on the upside,

8
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:33,359
the DOJ and I are in contact
about the terms of my immunity deal.

9
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:39,281
So yeah. Does not look good for them.

10
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:41,075
Right.

11
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:46,539
All that's on background, you know,
as we said a lot of moving parts.

12
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:49,792
- But.. but, yeah, please, let's...
- So you're okay if I record this, right?

13
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,336
Yeah. Hey, am I okay? I am I am great.

14
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:54,422
- Great. Thank you.
- Let's record. Open the kimono.

15
00:00:56,882 --> 00:00:58,509
Thank you.

16
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:01,262
So will this be in the piece?

17
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:05,808
"Kendall Roy ordered a shaved fennel salad
and picked at it, inquisitively?"

18
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:09,353
You're quite concerned
with how you're gonna come across.

19
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:11,772
Not really. No.

20
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:17,695
Am I? No, look, I come from a world of image,
that's the family business.

21
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,073
I mean, did you see
the Sophie Iwobi monologue?

22
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:25,703
Yeah. Well, she did a bit
"Oedipussy"?

23
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:30,583
It's funny, right? But, you know,
it doesn't hurt now because,

24
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:33,794
because I am who I am.

25
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:36,213
And, and, and I wanna plant a flag,

26
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:39,925
I wanna physically get in and plant a flag,

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,471
you know, for that
inside my family's business.

28
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:45,097
And in terms of your family business,

29
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:47,892
one question that people do have
is about your siblings.

30
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:51,061
So where are they in this?
Have you managed to stay close with them?

31
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,774
You know, sure. Absolutely.

32
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:00,321
There, there are issues, but, uh

33
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:04,408
essentially, yeah.

34
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:08,621
I'm just really happy in my headspace.

35
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,540
And I hope they're happy in theirs.

36
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:47,136
Hey. El Presidente.
How's your headspace? You happy in it?

37
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:49,471
Uh, yeah. You like the ending?

38
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:52,641
"Oh, I love my kids,
what are their names again?"

39
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,394
"Blur Face and Who Cares?"

40
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,564
- All right.
- Oh. And let's press go on that sale,

41
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,358
the Israeli machine learning operation.

42
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,444
- Okay?
- What?

43
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:06,530
What... nothing. Good.
Let me get into that.

44
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,407
- Look at me.
- No, I am.

45
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:11,035
- Hi. I see you.
- Action stations.

46
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:14,246
Strategy meet.
Time to go tickle my dad's balls.

47
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,415
- Yeah.
- Hi, Karolina.

48
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,669
I just hope our acting CEO
isn't getting too fucking acting.

49
00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:23,589
I'll tell you what's a scary
story we should maybe reboot.

50
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:26,842
Pinocchio. A puppet that comes to life.

51
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:30,012
Oh, come on. Let's get started.

52
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:33,891
- They can catch up.
- Hey, Dad. How's your headspace?

53
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:37,478
I hear Gerri's looking at the Israeli outfit.

54
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,191
-Uh, pretty insignificant.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

55
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,735
I have a shape of things in mind for that.

56
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,655
GoJo Go, I don't know, streaming.

57
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,033
No. Kill it, okay? Just kill it.

58
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,830
What? What?
Are you checking the chain of command?

59
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,540
No. Um...

60
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:02,336
What does he mean by "plant a flag", huh?

61
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:05,714
Please, don't fucking hover.

62
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:09,885
Um, there's talk that, uh,
Kendall's planning to come in.

63
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,055
- You're fucking kidding?
- Uh-hmm.

64
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:14,765
- In here?
- Uh-hmm.

65
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:18,894
That rat steps one foot inside this
building, I'll punch him in the nose, okay?

66
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,814
Well, I think that's the grown-up solution
that keeps everyone happy.

67
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:24,024
Find out what this fucker's planning.

68
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:28,153
- I don't need him in my teeth right now.
- I can I can scope that out.

69
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,031
I can catch him tonight, if you'd like,
at the journalism dinner.

70
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:33,867
But, you know, what are we doing to counter?

71
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:38,205
Yes. Yes! You should all be out there,
call him out on this.

72
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:41,709
well, we did discuss the town hall event?

73
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,545
Yeah. I like it. It brings everyone together.

74
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,881
- Yeah.
- Open, anonymous questions. Employee facing.

75
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:49,842
Yeah. I'm happy to lead it,
if it's about change.

76
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:52,302
Oh, you are?
Now who's planting a flag?

77
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:54,346
In terms of getting proactive,

78
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:58,058
Hugo had Frankton's put together
some full-page responses.

79
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:01,228
Yeah. There were a there were
a couple we liked.

80
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:06,608
Full-page, with, a number of pledges,
we can figure out the verbiage.

81
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:10,904
And the tagline "We Get It."

82
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:13,782
I thought it was quite funky.

83
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:16,910
"We get it." A bit like those ladies
on the cruise ship got it?

84
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:19,455
- Gerry liked it?
- Yeah, it's a little,

85
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,208
"Yeah, yeah, we get it already,
stop moaning about the rapes."

86
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,086
Logan, um, we have agents on the phone,

87
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,506
asking if Waystar's willing to accept
service of a document subpoena?

88
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,301
- Tell them to fuck off.
- Oh, okay.

89
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:35,929
- Kerry, hang on, he's kidding.
- Dad?

90
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:40,642
Logan, I'm just wondering, uh,
when we might start to play ball.

91
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:44,104
I mean, everybody cooperates.

92
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,899
Maybe I don't do that dance.

93
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:50,736
And how does that feel in regards
to the shareholder meeting?

94
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:54,323
We don't accept service, in an hour,
there's gonna be two agents here to serve you,

95
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:57,159
and while they're at it, they could
subpoena you to the grand jury.

96
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,869
Fuck 'em.

97
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,165
- Logan?
- Tell 'em to fuck off!

98
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,669
- FBI, hands up!
- Hey.

99
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,172
- How's it going?
- To be honest? Not great, Greg.

100
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,008
It's looking pretty bad with the
investigation, and, um,

101
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:15,427
Logan says we have to take these.

102
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:19,598
Cyanide pills. The whole team.

103
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:25,229
It's a mint, you doofus. Take one.
Your breath really does stink.

104
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:26,897
Hey, can I show you something?

105
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:28,857
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Come on.

106
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:36,782
Gregory, my chief of staff, leggy princeling
of ATN, you deserve a new office.

107
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,325
What do you think?

108
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:43,789
I mean, it's, it's not very nice.

109
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:46,959
That's rude, rude boy.
It's your new place.

110
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:49,461
Okay. I see this is punishment, right?

111
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:52,130
This is because I'm not taking
the company lawyer, right?

112
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:55,926
- And I am I getting demoted right now?
- In the middle of an investigation?

113
00:07:56,051 --> 00:08:01,473
No. No. This is just part of a totally
standard office rationalization.

114
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,477
No. No, no, no.
You do whatever you like, you know.

115
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:08,564
Hang out with Kendall.
Take your own counsel.

116
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,566
I hear you have a really great lawyer.

117
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,277
Is it true you can find him
anytime day or night?

118
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:14,778
- Yes.
- Because he has one of those bowties

119
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:17,364
- that lights up and spins around?
- He's actually really good.

120
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:19,324
I'm very, very happy with him.

121
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,535
Listen, on the level, buddy,

122
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:26,832
On the level, there are a million knives
being sharpened right now.

123
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:30,335
The DOJ's gonna be like a combine
harvester in a wheat field of dicks, okay?

124
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,881
So I understand, I get it.
I see that this is tough.

125
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:37,426
I have gone Waystar, I think that's safest.

126
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:44,224
But tonight, I'm actually seeing a pal
to get an objective take on my situation.

127
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:48,145
And if you want, if you want,
I can fold you in.

128
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,688
- Tonight?
- Yeah. I just thought, you know,

129
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:52,190
over a beer, we could kick back
and recall what happened,

130
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:56,403
and make sure that we remember it
exactly the same way.

131
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:00,324
- What?
- No. It's just Ken.

132
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,451
- Fuck Ken.
- Yeah. No, fuck Ken,

133
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,202
- a hundred percent,but...
- But what?

134
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:09,333
He's... it's stupid, he's giving me
a watch tonight to say thanks,

135
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,795
- um, for so, I don't know, I...
- You sold your ass for a watch?

136
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,382
I'll buy you a watch, dickwad.
Just fucking come over!

137
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,385
Okay. I'll try to come.
I wanna come.

138
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,555
Stay.

139
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,977
You know, your dad just wondered,

140
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:33,857
since the public discourse about your
father feels really one-sided...

141
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:36,526
Yes. We would love your help
getting more dimensions.

142
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:42,157
It would be totally controlled business
interview, with some softballs at the end.

143
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,410
Yeah. So Shiv, or someone like Shiv,

144
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:49,206
sharing some memories and feelings
about your dad.

145
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:55,087
Yeah, I see. I think I think I'm best
placed neutralizing Kendall.

146
00:09:55,754 --> 00:10:00,759
Okay. Well, you or someone like you.

147
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:08,558
All right. Yeah, fine. Fuck you.
I'll go out and I say I love Dad.

148
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:10,060
Why not? I do.
So yeah, fuck you.

149
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:13,188
Aww, look at you.
Cutest cheerleader in high school.

150
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,108
Is it true you let the track team
finger bang you for lunch money?

151
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:19,277
- Stop projecting your memories onto me.
- All right.

152
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:29,121
I like it. I like it. It's a good weight, I...

153
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:35,544
Ken? Real quick, can you, can you just
give me the green light on this?

154
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:38,964
It's very expensive.
I mean, I usually just use my phone

155
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,716
- for all my time needs.
- Yeah. Fuck it.

156
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:44,553
Fuck it, man, you deserve it.
Dude, your phone is a widget, a button.

157
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,681
Every janitor in America has one.

158
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:49,683
Your watch is a Mona-fucking-Lisa.

159
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:52,602
Okay, hey, shut the fuck up, Reece.
Guys, it is game time.

160
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:56,398
The game is Good Tweet, Bad Tweet!

161
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,735
Oh, shit!

162
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,362
Okay. You crazy fuckers better have these
ready when I call them out.

163
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:05,407
- Start it already.
- Okay. And... good tweet!

164
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:09,494
"Okay. Allies, don't always
come in the form we like."

165
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,789
But what Kendall Roy did
was important and brave."

166
00:11:12,914 --> 00:11:17,377
Boom! Boom, that's the shit!
All right, all right, all right. Bad tweet.

167
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:18,879
I got it, I got it, I got it.

168
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:21,339
- Bad tweet. Bad tweet.
- "Kendall Roy is not a hero, fam."

169
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:24,843
"He's bootleg Ross
with a daddy complex."

170
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:28,013
- Love it! Love it!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

171
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:29,681
- Good tweet, good tweet.
- Okay. Keep them coming, motherfuckers.

172
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:32,476
"Maybe it's just because
he's murking his shitty dad,"

173
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:35,270
"but I kind of wanna fuck Kendall Roy?"

174
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,982
- Oh, hell yeah! Booyah!
- Yeah, girl.

175
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:41,068
- Bad tweet, bad tweet, bad tweet.
- Hit me up. Hit me up.

176
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:43,361
Bad tweet, bad tweet, bad tweet,
bad tweet, bad tweet.

177
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,740
Okay. "He clearly has mental health
issues and crazy guilt"

178
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:50,744
"coupled with addiction.
That's all this is and it's sad."

179
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,666
- Boo!
- Boo! Boo! Boo.

180
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:03,340
That one sucked! That one sucked!
That one sucked! That one sucked!

181
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:11,139
- Hi!
- Hi!

182
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,809
- Hi! Wow.
- Let's speed it up, fellas.

183
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,565
Should I give them something?
- Yeah.

184
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:25,070
Fuck the patriarchy!

185
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:32,452
All right. Do we have like a safe word
to get out of here?

186
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,713
Excuse me.

187
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:51,721
- Shiv-fucking-Roy. Great to see you here.
- I always come.

188
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:55,517
The Committee for the Protection
and Welfare of Journalists?

189
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:59,604
You're into that, but you like to keep
them protected in hutches, correct?

190
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:02,274
With the little feeding bottles,
kind of like hamsters?

191
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,860
Yeah. Yeah. Adorable.
We do keep more newspapers alive

192
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:09,322
and employ more journalists worldwide than any
other company, so I guess we're doing our bit?

193
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:11,867
Uh-huh. The Soviet Union employed
a ton of journalists, too.

194
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,703
Oh, Nate, we got to Stalin so fast?

195
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,372
Is Gil still turning up on Russia Today
by mistake?

196
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,167
- Hey. Hey, man.
- Hey, Ken.

197
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:23,461
- Good to see you.
- It's a family affair.

198
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:25,964
Yeah, I didn't think you'd be here. I thought

199
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:30,010
the newly-minted President of Waystar Royco
would just be too busy.

200
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:31,636
- I'm on the advisory.
- Oh, right.

201
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:34,931
You're the newest attraction at the zoo,
half man, half Nobel Prize?

202
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:37,809
Oh, sure, Shiv. You got me.

203
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:43,940
Well, well, well, Shiv.
Really nice to see you, really.

204
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,241
- Hey.
- Hey.

205
00:13:56,828 --> 00:14:02,334
So how is he? Is he, like, angry hog at the
state fair, rolling in shit, snapping at kids?

206
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:07,714
He's fine.
He's worried you might come in.

207
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:12,385
- Let him worry.
- Okay. Well, that would just be dumb, Ken.

208
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,512
We all need for us to win
the shareholder vote.

209
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:17,557
You, too.
So just, you know, just wait a week.

210
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,435
And maybe cool it on the interviews
while you're at it?

211
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,604
- That'd be smart all round.
- Oh. Well, yeah. Maybe.

212
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,732
I'm not a suicide bomber, Shiv.

213
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:32,906
Hey, I wanted to say, um, just at Rava's?

214
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:42,082
I think I'm right, I am right, but I
maybe threw a couple of ugly rocks.

215
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,673
I'm just trying to be more thoughtful now.

216
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:53,969
- So...
- Look, I...

217
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:58,348
I think we have the same aim
here is the truth.

218
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:03,561
You know, big picture.
I am fucking tired of all this shit, too.

219
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,397
And I'm pushing for change.

220
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:10,402
Like, is there a world where you stop
being gross and throwing stones

221
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:16,408
and we can acknowledge and rebuild,
you know, truth and reconciliation.

222
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:20,704
You know, and maybe we can actually
find a way to fucking fix things

223
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:24,291
from the inside, which is the only place
that anything ever gets done anyway.

224
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,839
They made you get all dressed up for this?

225
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,719
Or do you not actually give a fuck?

226
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:37,721
And it's all just ego?

227
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,517
Look at this.

228
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,021
It's you now.

229
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,649
- "Ladies and gentlemen, to present our..."
- I'm sorry for you, Siobhan.

230
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:54,863
"who is used to owning the news rather
than being in the news, Kendall Roy."

231
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:05,457
So thanks for making time and,
when we do it, the first section will just be

232
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,876
- the South Asian streaming stuff?
- Yeah.

233
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,170
We'll have to ask the shareholder
meeting question.

234
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:12,380
- I'm very confident. Massive optimism.
- Great.

235
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,133
And then, you know, I think that
you know that there's this idea

236
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:18,178
that everyone felt it'd be really kind of fun

237
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:22,057
if after everything we might, open up the
door on some family stuff for a little bit.

238
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:25,935
No, I know, I know.
And we won't dwell on it, so,

239
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:28,313
we'll just keep it loose and,
it'd be fun to freewheel it, hmm?

240
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:31,274
Tell me precisely every single word
they're gonna ask me.

241
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:36,154
Well, I couldn't disclose specific questions
because of our policies at ATN Business

242
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,532
and that would be ethically, you know.

243
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:43,370
But, it's, it might be something like

244
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,498
"Logan seems like a business- oriented guy,"

245
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:49,376
"what's something special that you
and your dad enjoy doing together?"

246
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:52,837
- No! Next question.
- Okay. Sure.

247
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,299
"What was a time that your dad
came to your aid when you really needed him?"

248
00:16:56,424 --> 00:16:59,386
- Mmm, no. We're not doing that one.
- Right.

249
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:04,682
"What is your most cherished
father-son memory?"

250
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,936
So far, these are bad.

251
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,521
Well, how about, how about you lead?

252
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:12,399
Is there some sort of childhood, uh,
story that you'd like to tell?

253
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:19,531
I got a memory in the old bankiola.
some fly-fishing in Montana,

254
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:21,574
- Sure.
- If that interests you.

255
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,159
Thank you, Mr. Roy!

256
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,790
Um, well, I will pass that along.

257
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,210
- Hi.
- Hi.

258
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:34,838
And I don't want him...

259
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:37,632
- How are you doing?
- Love and marriage.

260
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:42,595
I feel another million drain with
every cluck from that hen house.

261
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:52,313
- Did you see him?
- I did.

262
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55,650
- Is he coming in?
- I don't know.

263
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:58,903
I don't think so.
I think he gets it.

264
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:02,782
Thank you.

265
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:06,119
You know, every time I don't see you out there
saying something, I think,

266
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:10,665
- "Does Shiv even like me?"
- Oh, come on. Roman is...

267
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,669
My daughter. My only daughter.

268
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:20,925
What is it exactly that you want me to do?

269
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,928
I don't know.
Draw a circle around him, maybe?

270
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,514
Declare that your old man
isn't some dirty bastard.

271
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:30,059
- Tell the truth, maybe, about him.
- Uh-hmm. Yeah.

272
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:32,937
The truth, but horrible in public, right?

273
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:36,941
- Do you trust me?
- Yes, of course.

274
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:43,740
- On what?
- On all this hullabaloo.

275
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:47,702
- "Hullabaloo"?
- Uh-huh.

276
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:52,248
Yeah.

277
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,709
I don't...

278
00:18:58,379 --> 00:18:59,756
Yeah.

279
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,428
- Can we I mean, can we talk?
- Yes. We can talk.

280
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:10,016
Okay. Well, we're a big company, but...

281
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:15,438
how bad is... is...
What is the worst thing

282
00:19:15,563 --> 00:19:17,190
- that could be in those papers?
- Not all that bad.

283
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:21,986
I mean Um, health, safety, compliance.

284
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,905
A few bad apples.

285
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:27,825
What? Well, I know that isn't true.

286
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,538
Come on, Dad. Tom worked in cruises,
Bill told him everything.

287
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:33,373
And besides,
I know that there were black ops

288
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:37,961
and I know that there was targeted
intimidation of victims and whistleblowers.

289
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:43,174
- NRPI, for fuck's sake.
- Maybe there were some salty moves.

290
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:46,928
- You can't just change your story.
- I wanna keep you clean.

291
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:51,432
I put Gerri in, but I can't trust her,
she's optics. I need you.

292
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:58,606
Listen, I didn't know about any of this shit.

293
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:01,526
Well, you're on emails.

294
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,736
Do you know how many emails I get a day?

295
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:06,114
I don't read my emails.
I get the action points.

296
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,951
- I know.
- Shiv, the world is fucking rough.

297
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,914
We ran a cruise line out of some tin pot ports
registered in bongo fucking bongo hovels

298
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,874
and we poured millions in it, sure.

299
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,335
Did we play rough
with the odd fucking union boss

300
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,005
or some Moaning Minnie repeat litigant?

301
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,800
I don't know!
It was a quarter of a century ago.

302
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,886
A lot of it. So yes.

303
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:31,556
I fought, for you and your brothers.

304
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:36,394
But you will not find a piece of paper
that makes you ashamed of me. Okay?

305
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:44,527
Well, the government does have an unbelievable
amount of leverage at its disposal, Dad.

306
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,032
- The law.
- Yeah, the law.

307
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:52,285
The law is people.

308
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:55,330
And people is politics.

309
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:58,625
And I can handle the people.

310
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:06,466
- Oh, that is nice.
- It's just beautiful,

311
00:21:06,591 --> 00:21:09,010
- I mean, it's just... it's...
- It's heavy.

312
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,763
Is it? I've always been self-conscious
about my wrists,

313
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:13,640
- It's saffron.
- so it could address that.

314
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:17,644
- You have normal wrists.
- Thanks, that is very nice of you to say.

315
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:21,814
- That is, you have some nice wrists yourself.
- Greg, do you think we could figure this out?

316
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:24,984
You wanna transfer now?
It's 40K.

317
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:29,989
Oh, no, no. Um, I think this is, uh,
like a gift situation.

318
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:33,409
Hey, Ken? Hey, Ken?

319
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:36,162
- Are you buying this?
- What?

320
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:38,748
- Are you buying him this?
- What? The... the watch?

321
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:41,876
No. No. I just said I'd hook you up, dude.

322
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:46,172
What is that look?
Don't get weird on me.

323
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:49,676
I'm not your fucking sugar daddy.
Cheapskate.

324
00:21:49,884 --> 00:21:51,636
No, that's... that's all good, I mean,

325
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,305
- it's $40,000 worth...
- I'm not buying that fucking watch.

326
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,475
- What the fuck is he talking about?
- No, I can't. I'm gonna need to give it back.

327
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,644
- It's not a good time. No, no, no, no, no.
- It has your patina now.

328
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:01,145
- No, I don't have patina.
- You agreed.

329
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,107
- No, I shower.
- Shit, she... did me again tonight.

330
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:07,777
Hey, hey, Comfry?
Sophie Iwobi did me again tonight.

331
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,655
I'm gonna do it. I'mma do it. Yeah.

332
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:13,116
- What?
- She did a segment.

333
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:15,451
- Oh, shit.
- Should we do this tomorrow, maybe?

334
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:17,954
- "Oedipussy 2."
- I could... I can get you some bullet points?

335
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,455
It looks like she tore me one.
Come on, fuck that.

336
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,874
We gotta we gotta watch this!

337
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,381
Hey, guys!
Guys! I'm gonna put on Sophie Iwobi.

338
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:30,133
It looks like she tore me one.

339
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:33,636
Hey, hey. Come on. We should watch this,
it'll be fun. Here it is.

340
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:38,057
"So let's turn for a moment to Kendall Roy
Whoo-hoo! my favorite white man."

341
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:40,351
"Snitchy Rich. Or as you may know him"

342
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:44,147
- "a jar of mayonnaise in a Prada suit."
- Ha! Okay.

343
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,024
"Roy tweeted earlier today,
"We must overthrow the culture"

344
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,194
- It's okay, you can laugh.
- "of corruption that silences women."

345
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,196
- "The fuck is he talking about?"
- Amen.

346
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:55,450
"That's like your dog saying,
"Hey, guys, guys, we have to punish""

347
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:59,454
""whoever ate coffee grounds out of the trash
and then shit on the sofa.""

348
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,539
"Hashtag Sofa Justice."

349
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,126
- That's great.
- "Actual progressives have been embracing"

350
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,170
"this dude. Why?"

351
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:10,465
"This is the guy who told Congress
like a month ago"

352
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,343
"that the investigation into
his father was a witch hunt."

353
00:23:14,677 --> 00:23:18,055
"And he's also the fail-bro
who once posed in this photo"

354
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:19,682
- Oh, shit.
- "flashing gang signs"

355
00:23:19,807 --> 00:23:22,393
- "outside of Jean Georges."
- Okay. That is such a reach.

356
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:24,854
- You were being tongue-in-cheek.
- She fucking loves me.

357
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:26,981
"See, the problem is, Kendall Roy suffers
from a severe case"

358
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,859
- This is love, it's all love.
- "of what doctors call Caucasian Rich Brain."

359
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:34,989
"What happens is, genetically inherited wealth
and whiteness can cause neural pathways"

360
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:38,326
"in the brain to constrict
and make the patient believe he's woke"

361
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,995
"when he's just a total fucking jackass."

362
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:45,333
- "Of course he's done wrong. Thank you."
- I feel like I should go on.

363
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,168
- What do you think? Can you touch base?
- I think we should talk to Berry

364
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,878
because there's a couple ways
to counter backlash,

365
00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:51,088
- and it might not be the best.
- Backlash? This is...

366
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:53,758
- This is not...
- This is being in the conversation.

367
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:56,302
- Yeah
- This is fucking great.

368
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,679
- This is great.
- Yeah.

369
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,975
- Hey.
- Shivy!

370
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,102
- Oh, hi!
- Hey.

371
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:07,772
- How was your guy? Did you see him?
- Yup.

372
00:24:08,189 --> 00:24:10,483
Yeah. When I got in,

373
00:24:10,608 --> 00:24:14,987
Mondale had eaten some of your pantyhose
and I had to pull them out of his ass.

374
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:17,156
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

375
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:20,243
You shouldn't leave them lying
around on the floor, Siobhan.

376
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:23,371
- Not once the help have gone.
- Yeah.

377
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:29,585
-You okay?
- Mondale's not well. Mondale's unsettled.

378
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:36,425
- Is, Kendall coming in to Waystar?
-I don't think so.

379
00:24:39,554 --> 00:24:41,430
- How is your guy?
- How is my guy?

380
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:47,812
- Uh-hmm.
- Well, um, well, uh...

381
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:53,442
Yeah. We I outlined what might have happened
to a theoretical John Doe, divisional head.

382
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:56,279
- Uh-hmm.
- And, you know, we talked about

383
00:24:57,238 --> 00:25:01,659
if what comes out does come out
in terms of the investigation, and he said

384
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:09,208
"It's very difficult to see a world in which
this John Doe doesn't go to jail."

385
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:12,920
- So.
- Right. Fuck.

386
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:18,259
Tom, it'll be okay.

387
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,807
And what evidence do you have for that?
I'm curious.

388
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:33,482
- Tom, honey?
- I did have one dumb idea.

389
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:35,735
- Uh-hmm?
- Yeah.

390
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,406
I was thinking, you know, maybe... maybe
it would be good to get out in front of it.

391
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:47,413
If prison is likely, could I find
any benefit in that, you know?

392
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:51,667
- You mean cooperate?
- No, not with DOJ.

393
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:53,961
Your dad.

394
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:59,550
I go to your dad and I... I offer
myself up as the beating post.

395
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:03,930
Uh, no, honey, you can't.

396
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:08,351
No. Honey, you're drunk.

397
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:17,735
But it is smart.

398
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:23,324
Yeah. It's, kind of a...
a win from a no-win.

399
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:26,369
- You think?
- Yeah. I mean, it's punchy.

400
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:32,333
I mean, you know, it's very likely
that no one goes to prison.

401
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:38,756
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- And either way, you bank gold with my dad.

402
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:43,094
The offer is kind of genius.

403
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:49,642
All being well, you know, with a fair wind,
I could be done in less than a year.

404
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:54,772
But, no, you can't, Tom.

405
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:58,567
Jesus. Everyone's doing fucking
somersaults for him right now.

406
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:10,496
"And he told congress like a month ago"

407
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:14,625
"that the investigation into his father
was a witch hunt."

408
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,672
"And he's also the fail-bro who once posed
in this photo, flashing gang signs"

409
00:27:19,797 --> 00:27:21,424
"outside of Jean-Georges."

410
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:23,384
"Poor Kenny."

411
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,971
"See, the problem is Kendall Roy
suffers from a severe case"

412
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:30,057
"of what doctors call
Caucasian Rich Brain."

413
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:34,478
- "Hey."
Hey, Jess.

414
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:38,149
- I'm going in.
- "Oh, okay. To the office?"

415
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:40,026
- Okay. Yeah.
- "When?"

416
00:27:40,151 --> 00:27:42,153
- Now.
- "But you said..."

417
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:45,406
Yeah. I said that was a false thought.
just make sure my office is ready.

418
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,116
I'll ping you before I arrive.

419
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,453
Good? Good? Great.

420
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:55,291
Greg. Yo. Hey, I'm going in.

421
00:27:55,833 --> 00:28:01,005
Yeah. I might wanna roll deep, so, uh,
just keep it on the down-low, okay?

422
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:02,673
I wanna see the shockwaves.

423
00:28:03,007 --> 00:28:04,884
- "November just around the corner,"
- Hi.

424
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:08,345
- "very important election..."
- Shouldn't be too long now.

425
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:14,393
Well, he has already brought more
voters, in a sense, by increasing...

426
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:18,647
Yeah, because I've, you know,
I've been, I've been...

427
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:24,320
I've been thinking, um, about what
it is that you might really need right now,

428
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:28,032
and, um, and how I can help.

429
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:35,748
Yeah. Yeah. Because, you know,
if, if things go how they could go,

430
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,376
maybe there's no repercussions.
But if not,

431
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:43,005
there'll probably be a cash number

432
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:48,719
and there will probably need to be
a face or two behind bars, right?

433
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:56,519
- What's your angle, Tom?
- No, none. None. Just just, uh

434
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:59,814
I'm probably in the firing line.

435
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:07,738
And I just wanted you to know if you
need to strategize, I can be that guy.

436
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:11,700
I'll step up and go down.

437
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:17,873
That's it?

438
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:23,254
- You don't want anything?
- No. No. It's just there.

439
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,675
If you need it. I won't wriggle.

440
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:32,263
Just clonk the trout on the head
and put it in your pouch.

441
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:35,808
It won't come to that.

442
00:29:37,101 --> 00:29:38,477
But...

443
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:43,607
thank you, Tom. Thank you.

444
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:47,570
- Not a problem.
- All he's doing, helping us to get

445
00:29:47,695 --> 00:29:50,322
our message out to Latino voters
who've really come around

446
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:52,741
to the President's message and, you know,

447
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:55,161
we saw Boyer on your program
a few nights ago.

448
00:29:55,286 --> 00:30:00,124
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely. Much for the president so...

449
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:24,732
"Bergman, Hendon, and Weiss."

450
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,400
Hello. Uh, hi.

451
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:31,739
I was given your number by a friend of mine
and I was wanting to, um

452
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:35,826
I would like to schedule an appointment
with Rex Hendon?

453
00:30:36,243 --> 00:30:38,662
- "This is for a consultation?"
- Uh-huh. That's right.

454
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:41,582
Excuse me, can you hold the line one second?

455
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:45,669
- Greg, talk fast. What is it? I'm busy.
- "Hey, so..."

456
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:48,672
"so I have something
that you guys might wanna know."

457
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:50,382
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

458
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:57,765
- Hey! How you doing?
- Great.

459
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,102
- Are you... what are you doing down here?
- Mark, isn't he the just fucking greatest?

460
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:05,356
- Sure. Yeah.
- As ever, great to have you contribute.

461
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:08,234
Could we do five
on what we need to do here?

462
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,735
Sure.

463
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,488
So how are things?

464
00:31:12,613 --> 00:31:14,823
Look at you, the tough guy!

465
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:16,951
You wouldn't even take service
of a subpoena, right?

466
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:20,037
Yeah. My son stands up,
waves his dick in the air,

467
00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:24,041
and the rest of the world is meant to
re-arrange itself according to his liking?

468
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,502
- I don't think so, right?
- I see.

469
00:31:26,627 --> 00:31:28,796
But are you gonna get more cooperative
now that you've set the table?

470
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,464
Oh, it's a witch hunt.

471
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:34,134
The prosecutors are gonna regret
any time or money they spend on it.

472
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,307
- What does the old man think?
- Not fucking much.

473
00:31:42,643 --> 00:31:46,063
No, he's got he's got poll numbers dancing
in front of his eyes morning, noon, and night.

474
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:48,983
So someone shits in Wisconsin,

475
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:53,570
he's worried it'll float down the Mississippi
and hurt his numbers in Iowa.

476
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:56,073
Relax. We've got his back!

477
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,868
Yeah, well that's great.

478
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:07,459
I guess, you know, when this thing broke the
whole thing was, "Logan Roy's going down."

479
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:11,380
But then you got this thing, some of our folks
are like, "There's no way Roy's going down."

480
00:32:11,505 --> 00:32:14,717
"The President's gonna protect him.
The system is broken!"

481
00:32:14,925 --> 00:32:16,969
People have no idea.

482
00:32:17,219 --> 00:32:21,265
- They have these paranoid fantasies.
- Yeah.

483
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:26,645
- I don't want you to do anything.
- Right.

484
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:30,399
What I want is, is nothing.

485
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:35,029
Normal consideration not to become
the focus of some bullshit.

486
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:37,031
- Right.
- Not favors.

487
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:40,909
- Right.
- Right, right, right, right, right.

488
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:43,746
- What?
- The fact is,

489
00:32:43,871 --> 00:32:46,457
I don't want anything from anyone.

490
00:32:46,582 --> 00:32:49,752
That's not the way I operate,
but I would like to know

491
00:32:49,877 --> 00:32:53,589
that no one's gonna shit
their pants if I hang tough.

492
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:57,843
Facebook is full of photos of you
and the boss at CPAC and Davos.

493
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,804
All the nice things you've said
about each other?

494
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,058
It hits the demographic
we have to worry about.

495
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:11,440
If that Raisin hangs me out to dry,
I'm quite willing to do the same to him.

496
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:16,236
Well, if we're gonna be real, maybe
the president has not been feeling

497
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:19,990
like your coverage has been very
helpful or truthful lately.

498
00:33:20,115 --> 00:33:23,327
It could get a lot fucking worse!

499
00:33:26,747 --> 00:33:29,249
We have the same interest here.

500
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:34,171
Can you lower the temperature?
And I'll see what I can do.

501
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,925
Sure. That's all I need.

502
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:43,680
- Excuse me.
- So we asked everyone to submit

503
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:47,684
concerns and questions
anonymously via the Intranet.

504
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:52,106
Which has some drawbacks, as you know,
and we wanted you to be aware, Shiv.

505
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:55,192
If you're gonna be up there,
so we plan to put these on, um, a screen

506
00:33:55,317 --> 00:33:59,029
- And what are they asking?
- Well, the general tenor is,

507
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:01,907
"What the hell's happening here?"

508
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:03,409
A lot of those.

509
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:08,247
also, "I'm embarrassed to say to my mother
I work at Waystar. Any advice?"

510
00:34:08,372 --> 00:34:10,374
- Yeah, fuck your mother.
- "Please tell us anything at all"

511
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,376
- "about what is happening here."
- Oh, God.

512
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:15,254
- Did they write these questions in crayon?
- I mean, I have my speech all set.

513
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:17,005
Do we even really need
to have questions?

514
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:19,967
Well, we did say we wanted to
answer questions, so...

515
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:23,387
- Yeah. There we go.
- Okay. Well, dad can't see this one

516
00:34:23,512 --> 00:34:26,432
- or this one.
- Oh, fuck no.

517
00:34:26,557 --> 00:34:28,016
- This will make him shit his Pop Tarts.
- No, no.

518
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:30,310
- I think there's like three here we can use.
- Okay.

519
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:32,104
- Three is all we need.
- But this is just fucking rude.

520
00:34:32,229 --> 00:34:33,689
- I mean, it's not even really a question.
- Okay.

521
00:34:33,814 --> 00:34:35,941
I mean, I don't think people should
even be thinking this that work here.

522
00:34:36,191 --> 00:34:37,776
- You're right.
- Can we get different questions like

523
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:39,278
- less question-y questions?
- Yeah. Uh-hmm.

524
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:40,946
- 'Cause these are just fucking horrible.
- We can.

525
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:42,739
- Okay. Well, Hugo and I did prepare...
- Something else.

526
00:34:42,865 --> 00:34:47,161
a set of questions that are of the sort of
things that people would actually wanna know.

527
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,705
- Great.
- Yeah. I mean these, we feel,

528
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,749
- are people's real questions, okay?
- We've got a problem.

529
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,170
- Logan wants to see you in his office.
- Now?

530
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:00,549
- "Hello?"
- Lisa.

531
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:04,845
- Lisa! The Regal Legal Eagle.
- "Kendall, I hear you're going in."

532
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,555
- "What the fuck?"
- Yeah.

533
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,807
I can't let him dominate
the battlespace, Lisa.

534
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:11,560
My sister is making moves,
I can't just watch it happen.

535
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,104
What... what's the story on my immunity?

536
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:17,149
"I'm figuring out a
"Queen for a Day" situation, Kendall."

537
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:19,067
- "I have to have control here."
- Yeah, but we're losing the momentum.

538
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:21,028
Can we get a raid? What about a raid?
Can we get a raid?

539
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:24,865
- "We can't "get" anything."
- No, sure. But really?

540
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,620
I mean, we hit the right buttons.
Has the government gone soft-cock on Big Corp?

541
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:31,830
I'll call you in 40, Lisa.
You're the boss here! Bye.

542
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:36,502
And let's commit to Iwobi. Yeah?
Let's do it. Reach out.

543
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,795
Call Noah and get me some jokes.

544
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:43,217
Not jokes, like, funny as fuck shit,
but not in a stupid jokey way.

545
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:46,345
- Is it true? He's on his way?
- Fucking rat.

546
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,722
I'm gonna jam a Montblanc
down his fucking throat.

547
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,891
- He'll eat up any drama, Dad.
- Kerry!

548
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,435
Look, why don't we just let him
come on in and ignore him?

549
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,604
Get us Colin, get us building services.

550
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:57,314
If he comes for me,
I want him fucking cuffed.

551
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,107
- Okay.
- He's fired!

552
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:03,820
HR is discussing him stepping down
from his duties, but firing?

553
00:36:03,946 --> 00:36:05,697
You would be handing DOJ a gas can.

554
00:36:05,822 --> 00:36:07,741
- Yeah.
- It would be a PR disaster.

555
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:10,118
- Want me to get outside counsel on the line?
- Front desk says he's pulling up.

556
00:36:10,244 --> 00:36:13,121
I don't want people seeing him.
Keep him the fuck out!

557
00:36:23,674 --> 00:36:25,133
How are you?

558
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:29,805
Sir. I'm... I'm sorry.

559
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,809
- Yeah?
- Just Your keycard has expired.

560
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:38,355
- Expired? That's weird.
- Hi, Kendall.

561
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,149
- Uh, bit of a crazy morning here.
- Oh, is it?

562
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:44,528
If you like, we could head over
to 43 North and I can fill you in.

563
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:46,113
Might be a little bit more comfortable there.

564
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:47,990
Yeah. Not going to the satellite office.
Thanks.

565
00:36:48,115 --> 00:36:52,619
My card doesn't work, so I'm just gonna
hurdle the gates and have Remi film it.

566
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,830
What? No, who's... How about
we go up with you?

567
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:56,832
- We go up together. We'll swipe you in.
- You guys wanna sync up?

568
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:58,500
- They can't go up.
- 'Cause they... They're inviting me to...

569
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:01,336
- No. He can go up. He can't go up.
- They told us he can't go up.

570
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,213
- Really? Sorry, who's "they"? Who's "they"?
- We can't authorize that.

571
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,048
- Well...
- I can authorize that.

572
00:37:05,173 --> 00:37:06,550
- I am authorizing that.
- Let... Hey...

573
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:09,678
We probably can't keep him
out of the town hall, correct?

574
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:13,015
"You can discourage him from
attending in light of his position."

575
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,020
Can we discourage him with a taser shot
directly to his peni or scrummage sacking?

576
00:37:18,145 --> 00:37:20,522
- He's headed for the freight.
- Fine.

577
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:23,567
Bring him up in the dumbwaiter
like a fucking hamburger.

578
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:25,861
- All right. What's up, bro?
- Hey.

579
00:37:26,486 --> 00:37:28,572
- Doing the heavy lifting.
- Yeah.

580
00:37:29,197 --> 00:37:33,118
- Is he there?
- I don't see him yet with his stupid walk.

581
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:38,665
Tom, get Sam and Ray in IT, and make
sure he doesn't get fucking cute with IT.

582
00:37:42,669 --> 00:37:44,046
Hey, man.

583
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:53,055
- Good to see you, man. Hey, man.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

584
00:37:53,597 --> 00:37:55,599
- Hey.
- Kind of weird, right?

585
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:57,517
- It's pretty weird.
- Yeah.

586
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,269
- But, you know, yeah.
- How's it going?

587
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:02,564
- Yeah. Life goes on, you know? Yeah.
- Buddhist.

588
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:04,775
Nice. Life does go on.

589
00:38:05,692 --> 00:38:08,862
So what so what's going on
back there in my dad's office?

590
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:12,115
He got any backchannel White House
contacts in there or what?

591
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,579
- I'm joking. You can't tell me that.
- Right. Right, right.

592
00:38:17,704 --> 00:38:20,666
And do you have
an immunity deal with DOJ?

593
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,505
- Do you?
- It's good we can kid around like this.

594
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:31,176
But look, man, you're actually
in a difficult spot.

595
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,639
I know it's... it's no fun being the last
fucking eunuch in the forbidden city.

596
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:38,141
I'm doing fine.

597
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:45,190
Well, I like you
and I have no beef with you, Tom.

598
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,737
Another life is possible, brother.

599
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,785
He's trying to kiss or nibble Tom.

600
00:38:56,993 --> 00:39:00,205
Let's just not turn this into
the Invasion of Normandy, okay?

601
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:07,963
- 2010....
- Okay. Okay.

602
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:12,759
Locked out.
Does it feel cold to you in here?

603
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,388
- Right?
- It... Is it?

604
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:25,230
You got to be kidding me.

605
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:28,316
Yeah, yeah. They've...
they've... they've hacked my AC.

606
00:39:28,442 --> 00:39:32,320
I think... I think this is a 68,
how you like it.

607
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:34,489
68? This isn't 68, no fucking way.

608
00:39:34,614 --> 00:39:40,203
This is like 65, 62.
Definitely feels a little cool.

609
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:43,039
- Okay, Remi.
- Yeah.

610
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:47,002
-I'm airdropping you a little shopping list.
- Okay.

611
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:49,087
-You gonna come back stat?
- I can do that.

612
00:39:49,546 --> 00:39:53,091
- What time does the town hall start?
- Um, two o'clock.

613
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:54,926
- Two o'clock? Okay.
- Yeah.

614
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:59,139
Yeah.

615
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:07,355
- What?
- Just checking in.

616
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:13,779
Okay. Yeah. I'm just...

617
00:40:20,202 --> 00:40:22,496
I know you.

618
00:40:35,842 --> 00:40:38,720
- So, if you're ready?
- Will my dad be there?

619
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:44,059
- Undermining my authority?
- He'll be nearby emphasizing your authority.

620
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:46,269
The live feed will be streaming
through the whole building

621
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:48,814
and to all major offices globally.

622
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:51,858
And anything you need, I'll be here.

623
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,735
Congratulations, by the way.

624
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:58,240
I was always pushing for you to be brought in
in my own little way. I think this...

625
00:41:01,368 --> 00:41:05,705
And now please welcome our new
Domestic President, Siobhan Roy.

626
00:41:11,753 --> 00:41:14,631
Thank you all. Thank you.
Thank you, Karolina.

627
00:41:15,715 --> 00:41:18,301
Okay, so I will keep this straightforward.

628
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:24,933
A senior executive at Waystar who also
happens to be a senior brother of mine,

629
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:26,810
I think I can legally say that,

630
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:29,563
has made some very serious allegations

631
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:32,524
and as we take those allegations seriously,

632
00:41:32,649 --> 00:41:36,486
there is, you'll understand, a fair amount
that we can't talk about legally.

633
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:41,950
However, this is still a family operation in
spirit and you are all a part of that family.

634
00:41:42,075 --> 00:41:46,121
So as much as we can tell you,
you know, we want to tell you,

635
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:52,377
I'm Siobhan Roy, Waystar's
new President of Domestic Operations.

636
00:41:52,502 --> 00:41:57,424
And I'm paying particular and specific
attention to corporate responsibility.

637
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:03,763
I know that some of you have concerns,
and I'm here to tell you we get it.

638
00:42:04,931 --> 00:42:07,976
If mistakes have been made
historically at Cruises,

639
00:42:08,101 --> 00:42:12,522
we are going to identify them
and implement, uh...

640
00:42:14,524 --> 00:42:17,068
What's more, personal accountability

641
00:42:17,193 --> 00:42:21,990
is one of the four core pillars
of the Waystar philosophy. Hugo?

642
00:42:22,115 --> 00:42:24,492
- Yeah. Yeah.
- We got that. Thank you.

643
00:42:25,118 --> 00:42:26,703
some people might think this, issue is a joke,

644
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:29,539
but we, assure you, we take it
very seriously. Just... Thank you.

645
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:31,166
Go and find what the fuck
is going on, please.

646
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:34,753
So we are going to ensure
that those who engaged in any actions

647
00:42:34,878 --> 00:42:38,381
that went beyond mere mistakes,
to more purpos-ul... Purposeful...

648
00:42:42,886 --> 00:42:44,554
Can we get that sorted?

649
00:42:46,306 --> 00:42:52,479
I assure you, we take this issue
very seriously even if someone here is not.

650
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:12,374
Fucking ruined it.

651
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:56,960
Sorry, Pinky.

652
00:43:57,711 --> 00:43:59,754
Now do you see? Huh?

653
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:11,516
- Hey, Ken.
- Hey.

654
00:44:19,816 --> 00:44:21,192
Thanks.

655
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:27,532
- Are we close? What time is it?
- Oh, what time is it?

656
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:31,536
Oh, it's, it's like the 18th century
or something when watches didn't work.

657
00:44:31,661 --> 00:44:33,038
- It doesn't work?
- No.

658
00:44:33,163 --> 00:44:38,668
- Why did you get it?
- Why did I get it? You encouraged me.

659
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:41,337
You don't remember this?
You shrugged at me like it was reasonable.

660
00:44:41,463 --> 00:44:42,881
- This one's good.
- Not if it doesn't work.

661
00:44:43,006 --> 00:44:45,675
It's fine. It's okay.
I I'm a humble custodian now.

662
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,261
A piece like this will often have to go
to Switzerland for six months.

663
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:51,514
So I have this funny bit about how,
for the special committee of the board.

664
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:54,184
And the... the white shoe firm
that will handle the investigation,

665
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:57,979
how my dad's putting pressure to hire
a firm that will help them cover up.

666
00:44:58,104 --> 00:45:01,524
- Do you hear anything?
- So it's, it's like, cover-up.

667
00:45:01,649 --> 00:45:04,194
Cover-Up 'R" Us. Like Toys 'R' Us.

668
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:06,571
- Cover-up 'R' Us.
- Yeah.

669
00:45:07,197 --> 00:45:08,740
- No?
- I don't know.

670
00:45:08,865 --> 00:45:11,993
- No.
- But I think that the Love Boat vids

671
00:45:12,118 --> 00:45:13,495
- are good.
- Yeah, Love Boat.

672
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,997
Hey! Because we pushed taping for you,
we're still filling up the audience.

673
00:45:16,122 --> 00:45:17,791
- But shouldn't be too long.
- Cool.

674
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:20,168
- Do you guys need anything?
- We're great. Thank you.

675
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:22,962
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. Yeah.

676
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:25,215
- He's just jerking off his invisible friend.
- No.

677
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,258
Hey, so, where are the writers at?

678
00:45:27,383 --> 00:45:29,219
- Um, generally writers and guests are...
- Oh, no, generally,

679
00:45:29,344 --> 00:45:31,513
but I knew a guy at the Lampoon
who knows Dylan.

680
00:45:31,638 --> 00:45:34,557
Can I just find them to say hi? I might pitch
a couple of areas for the gigglebots?

681
00:45:34,682 --> 00:45:36,059
Oh, well, we don't really have time.

682
00:45:36,184 --> 00:45:37,852
- We gotta kind of get up there.
- It's cool, I'll find him.

683
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,649
Hey, Rome, how you doing?

684
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:46,027
I've just been on TV waxing lyrical
about me and dad out

685
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:50,532
murdering trout and singing sea shanties
around the old marshmallow hole.

686
00:45:50,865 --> 00:45:53,493
- Have you read this thing?
- Now, I talked dad down.

687
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:57,247
- He wanted us all to appear on a talk show.
- Get the fuck out of here.

688
00:45:57,372 --> 00:45:59,707
Sitting on a couch together
I thought would be very gauche.

689
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:04,420
So I drafted this to land and to end debate
He wants us all to sign it.

690
00:46:04,546 --> 00:46:07,215
Man, this is quite a rich brew.

691
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,552
Well, I think a formal response
really draws a line under it.

692
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:14,514
I'm sure you're being asked,
so this is just us very clearly saying

693
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:16,266
that we're not a part of Kendall's thing.

694
00:46:18,351 --> 00:46:20,520
What? You would have
to say it's accurate.

695
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:22,689
Yeah, accurate like Oswald was accurate.

696
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:25,275
I want us all to sign it
for release to media tonight.

697
00:46:28,862 --> 00:46:34,826
I mean, it's kind of
It's kind of a greeting card from hell.

698
00:46:35,034 --> 00:46:38,246
- What?
- It's a Times New Roman firing squad.

699
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:41,499
Yeah, it's pretty horrible, you know?

700
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:45,712
Well. It's all basically verified so...

701
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:50,258
Well, yeah, drug addict, serial liar,
absentee father,

702
00:46:50,675 --> 00:46:53,511
history of his own
problematic relations with women.

703
00:46:53,636 --> 00:46:55,972
- Which of those isn't true?
- No. It's accurate, you know.

704
00:46:56,097 --> 00:46:59,475
But this would be out there, like, forever.

705
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:02,395
You know, PGN pulls up that photo of me
with the pony tail

706
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,230
anytime they wanna
make me look untrustworthy.

707
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:06,816
Okay. Look, Kendall is on a mission.

708
00:47:06,941 --> 00:47:09,152
And he's not going to stop
unless we take his legs out.

709
00:47:09,277 --> 00:47:11,946
And did dad want for all of us to do this?

710
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:14,282
It's more powerful if it
comes from all three of us.

711
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:19,078
- Now, you're full of shit.
- What?

712
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,247
- I'm... I'm not signing this.
- Roman, why not?

713
00:47:21,873 --> 00:47:25,084
Because I don't want to.
It makes me feel unwell.

714
00:47:25,752 --> 00:47:28,338
He taught me how to aim
my peepee in the toilet.

715
00:47:28,463 --> 00:47:29,839
The fuck?
That's not a reason, Roman.

716
00:47:29,964 --> 00:47:32,425
Take me to reason court
and fucking sue me.

717
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,094
Roman, we all have to do things
we don't want to sometimes.

718
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,890
I just don't.
This is not in my best interest, so, no.

719
00:47:41,601 --> 00:47:44,312
- Connor?
- Well, I don't wanna be a bitch.

720
00:47:44,437 --> 00:47:48,691
But my signature is valuable real estate
and I'm not giving it away for free.

721
00:47:48,816 --> 00:47:53,321
- Okay. What do you want?
- I would like some consideration.

722
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,449
I would like some suck, suck
on my dicky-dick.

723
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:58,618
- Oh, my God.
- Same.

724
00:47:58,743 --> 00:48:00,828
I'm feeling brutally
un-suck-sucked right now.

725
00:48:00,954 --> 00:48:02,538
You're babies.

726
00:48:02,705 --> 00:48:05,667
- Take my name off, please.
- Fine. I'll do it myself.

727
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:08,169
Thanks all the fucking help as always.

728
00:48:09,545 --> 00:48:13,216
Um, it's so good to see so many of you
here to tonight.

729
00:48:13,341 --> 00:48:16,928
Our amazing advertisers, and, you know,
we'd be nothing without you.

730
00:48:17,053 --> 00:48:21,307
And I just wanna say to you all
whatever is happening up in the clouds,

731
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:26,854
where the gods play a little rough and tumble,
down here, it is very much, business as usual.

732
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:31,401
So here's to you, here's
to weathering the storm.

733
00:48:32,944 --> 00:48:35,321
Yeah, like that's... that's
closer to the idea...

734
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:37,365
Here they are.

735
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,369
The geniuses at work!
Clickity- clack, clickity-clack.

736
00:48:41,494 --> 00:48:42,996
- Okay. Hello.
- Dylan?

737
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:45,081
- Yeah?
- Yeah, hey, I I knew Pat at the Lampoon.

738
00:48:45,206 --> 00:48:47,500
- Oh, okay.
- He says you're like a super funny dude.

739
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,794
- Oh, well
- Yeah. No, you are.

740
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,713
I just wanted to drop by
and let you guys know

741
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,967
you do awesome work,
very smart, very satirical.

742
00:48:56,092 --> 00:48:57,468
- Cool. Thanks, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

743
00:48:57,593 --> 00:49:00,847
- Hey, listen, I want you guys to hit me.
- Yes.

744
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:03,433
Just Rickles the fuck
out of Oedipussy here?

745
00:49:03,558 --> 00:49:06,227
- I can take it.
- Well, it's just the show so...

746
00:49:06,352 --> 00:49:08,313
- Yeah, yeah. It's the show.
- You know.

747
00:49:08,438 --> 00:49:10,982
- Hey. Ken, can I grab for a second?
- Hey. These are the writers.

748
00:49:11,107 --> 00:49:13,318
- Hi.
- Dylan, my man. Hurt me.

749
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:14,986
- Ken. Ken.
- Fucking hurt me.

750
00:49:15,111 --> 00:49:18,072
- Please.
- Jesus Christ.

751
00:49:18,197 --> 00:49:20,033
- What's up?
- I'm not sure how wide this has gone,

752
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:22,243
- I'm just seeing it now. But...
- Okay.

753
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:23,786
You should...

754
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,709
- So... okay.
- Yeah.

755
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:36,883
So... So... What... what do I...
What do we do with this?

756
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:41,262
Because this is actually really
sort of nothing, I think.

757
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,892
- Yeah?
- No, I wouldn't say it's nothing.

758
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:47,894
That's below the belt.

759
00:49:48,478 --> 00:49:51,230
Is the world seeing this or
or just basically us?

760
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:53,441
Yeah the whole world.

761
00:49:54,776 --> 00:49:57,320
Can we ask them not to use it tonight?
Will they mention it?

762
00:49:57,445 --> 00:50:01,574
- I think they'll probably mention it.
- But they but it's private, I feel like...

763
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:04,369
Yeah. But it's not private.

764
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:07,372
- No.
- No. Okay.

765
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:11,209
I mean, can I still go on?
I feel like I still go on, right?

766
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:15,296
- Yeah, I know. I think it's fine.
- Yeah.

767
00:50:15,421 --> 00:50:18,841
It's just the kind of thing where we
just maybe steer away from it.

768
00:50:18,966 --> 00:50:21,344
- You know? Maybe...
- Here, here.

769
00:50:22,428 --> 00:50:25,223
- Right. So, my concern is that it might...
- Yeah.

770
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:28,226
- It might be weird if we don't mention it.
- Sure.

771
00:50:29,102 --> 00:50:31,354
- Absolutely.
- Okay. Good.

772
00:50:31,813 --> 00:50:34,107
Look, it is big of you to come here.

773
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:36,442
- We wanna be fair.
- Totally. And I'm game.

774
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:37,944
- Okay. That's great.
- Yeah.

775
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:41,864
There's just a you know,
a possibility with all the legal of it

776
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:44,492
that I might have to bow out,
but we're good.

777
00:50:44,617 --> 00:50:46,369
- We're good.
- Right.

778
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:52,208
- We tape in 15 minutes.
- Sure, no, and I'd help with that. Obviously.

779
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:55,795
- Right. How would you help with that?
- I know people.

780
00:50:56,129 --> 00:50:59,173
You... You're gonna what?
Call Jay-Z and get him to...

781
00:50:59,298 --> 00:51:00,675
- Yeah. A name.
- to do the show in 15 minutes?

782
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,176
- I can do that.
- No, no.

783
00:51:02,802 --> 00:51:04,178
I think you're over-thinking this.

784
00:51:04,303 --> 00:51:07,181
It's a comedy show.
We're gonna we're gonna have fun.

785
00:51:07,306 --> 00:51:09,809
And Sophie is tough, but she's fair.

786
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:12,687
Look, and you're our guest.

787
00:51:12,812 --> 00:51:14,564
- So...
- No, I know. You're right.

788
00:51:14,689 --> 00:51:18,109
- Yeah. So we're... we're good?
- Okay. Yeah, no, for sure.

789
00:51:18,234 --> 00:51:19,652
- Okay.
- Okay.

790
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:21,154
Great.

791
00:52:59,752 --> 00:53:01,128
Hey!

792
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:06,217
- Hey.
- What are you in for?

793
00:53:06,342 --> 00:53:10,388
Ah, me? Just running some numbers
with Gerri on you know,

794
00:53:11,264 --> 00:53:16,018
the fucking getting the distribution deals
for these Fucking... It's murder.

795
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:19,105
- Good kid.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

796
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,943
Um, but sorry about the letter or whatever,
I just...

797
00:53:24,068 --> 00:53:25,611
Keeping your nose out, huh?

798
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:28,823
- Well, I don't know, I guess.
- Smart cookie, huh?

799
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:32,410
- Smart little fucking cookie, hey?
- Well, you know?

800
00:53:33,786 --> 00:53:37,123
- I, saw your little interview.
- Oh, right.

801
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:40,376
- Yeah, we don't have to dissect that.
- "Ooo, I wuv my daddy".

802
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:45,464
- Yeah.
- I never figured you for a faggot.

803
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:49,051
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- I know, I know.

804
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,389
So what's this, uh fishing thing?

805
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:57,310
- I don't remember.
- Oh, yeah, that was, Connor, actually.

806
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:59,020
Connor took me on that.

807
00:53:59,145 --> 00:54:04,483
But, you know, single multi-use
happy childhood memory. So yeah.

808
00:54:06,652 --> 00:54:08,613
"Oh, my God. Such sad news."

809
00:54:08,738 --> 00:54:12,867
"Guess what, we're down a guest.
Oedipussy has ghosted my ass."

810
00:54:13,826 --> 00:54:19,332
"Yeah. And I'm like heartbroken, because I had
so many names I was going to call him."

811
00:54:19,707 --> 00:54:21,083
Wokestar Royco.

812
00:54:21,584 --> 00:54:24,670
"Benedickhead Arnold, Paranoid Kendroid."

813
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:30,635
"But honestly, nothing could be as brutal
as the open letter his own sister released."

814
00:54:31,052 --> 00:54:34,430
""I am deeply concerned for the
wellbeing of my brother.""

815
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:37,975
""Our entire family has supported
him through his many attempts""

816
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:41,479
""at rehabilitation
for his multiple addictions.""

817
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:44,690
""But the events of the last days
have made it clear""

818
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,110
""that our hopes for his recovery
were misplaced.""

819
00:54:48,235 --> 00:54:51,322
""I've now been a direct witness
to his misogynistic rants""

820
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:54,075
""and comparisons
to world historical figures""

821
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,662
""that were suggestive of grandiose
and disordered thinking""

822
00:54:57,787 --> 00:55:01,415
""and I would ask that people give my brother
privacy and consideration""

823
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,043
""during this difficult time.""

824
00:55:04,919 --> 00:55:09,173
"And that's from his sister
and she's the fucking nice one."

825
00:55:16,055 --> 00:55:19,350
- The FBI is downstairs.
- What?

826
00:55:19,934 --> 00:55:21,727
- Yeah.
- Tell them to fuck off.

827
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:23,604
Yeah, these are the ones
who don't fuck off.

828
00:55:23,729 --> 00:55:26,315
- This is a search warrant.
- What do they do at the front desk?

829
00:55:26,774 --> 00:55:28,150
What are we doing?
They're at the gates.

830
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:30,695
- Can we call Southern district?
- Okay.

831
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,822
- Get Layo, get, get, get, get, get.
- Okay, okay.

832
00:55:33,322 --> 00:55:35,241
Can we stall 'em?
Shall I call Michelle-Anne?

833
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:39,245
No, I think that the Deputy Attorney General
got spooked by you talking to Michelle-Anne.

834
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:42,331
Well, what the fuck did Michelle-Anne do?
She's got no fucking acumen.

835
00:55:42,456 --> 00:55:44,625
Well, I guess the Government
isn't a fucking Pez dispenser.

836
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,460
You don't push a button and
something pops out the other end.

837
00:55:46,585 --> 00:55:48,963
- Yes, I am well-aware.
- There's about 20 of them down there.

838
00:55:49,088 --> 00:55:51,173
Why don't we just ask them
if they can come back tomorrow?

839
00:55:51,298 --> 00:55:54,677
Logan, they are coming up, and if you
don't open the door, they will kick it in.

840
00:55:54,802 --> 00:55:57,930
And if you don't open the filing cabinet,
they will pull out a crow bar.

841
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:00,933
This is a show of resolve
and there are cameras outside

842
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:04,186
and they do not need to see
the FBI meeting any resistance.

843
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:05,688
What do we say?

844
00:56:17,366 --> 00:56:18,826
Cooperate.

845
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:20,578
- Open up. Let them in.
- Come on. Let's go.

846
00:56:20,703 --> 00:56:24,248
Okay. I will call down and I'll ask to talk to
the lead agent and we will work something out.

847
00:56:24,373 --> 00:56:26,208
- Okay.
- We're cooperating?

848
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:27,835
We're cooperating.

849
00:56:28,002 --> 00:56:33,591
Get the special committee, shift the legals.
We're cooperating.

850
00:56:35,134 --> 00:56:39,805
People watch our channel for so long,
we had to animate our logo

851
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,475
because it was burning into people's screens.

852
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,811
I mean, that is how loyal the viewers are.

853
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:50,399
And you know, we will survive this whole
episode because... Because of our strength,

854
00:56:50,524 --> 00:56:55,070
because of our depth of talent,
and because of our values.

855
00:56:55,196 --> 00:56:58,073
Our true values. Yes?

856
00:57:07,917 --> 00:57:09,919
Um, guys, just a little heads-up.

857
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:13,547
And this is not something I want us to get out
of proportion or spoil the evening,

858
00:57:13,672 --> 00:57:17,051
but it would that seem some agents
of Federal law enforcement

859
00:57:17,176 --> 00:57:19,553
are raiding the premises right now.

860
00:57:19,678 --> 00:57:22,556
So if you see them, that's what that is.

861
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:30,606
It's fine. It's fine.
Just fucking leave it.

862
00:57:33,192 --> 00:57:38,906
"As you can see, the FBI is currently raiding
Waystar headquarters in lower Manhattan."

863
00:57:39,114 --> 00:57:43,285
"In order to execute an..."
