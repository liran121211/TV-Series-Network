1
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:00,481
Oh, could Logan just get five?

2
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:05,944
Welcome. How's your dad?

3
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:09,364
Oh, pretty good. He hopes to make it
in person to the next one.

4
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:11,575
- Oh, sure. Send him my best.
- I will.

5
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,162
But still, you're here, and that's nice.

6
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:17,914
Thanks. I feel the same way.

7
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:20,417
Great. We're all over the fucking moon.
What is this?

8
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:25,756
Yeah. So we are in discussions
to acquire GoJo.

9
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:28,884
Okay. How advanced?

10
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:32,804
Oh, not that advanced.
Just getting to outline terms.

11
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:34,723
So pretty fucking advanced?

12
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:38,143
Well, we didn't wanna bother you
until we have some protein.

13
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:41,480
But we didn't wanna ambush you in the
boardroom. We wanted to let you know in here.

14
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:44,399
- But you are still ambushing us.
- No, no, no. We are not ambushing.

15
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:49,446
Well, no, I mean, if you jump out on someone
on the road in the middle of the night,

16
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:53,408
hit them on the head and shout "I'm not
ambushing you," it's still a fucking ambush.

17
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:59,915
I love my business. But we've had our throats
slit on ads for 20 years. We're bleeding out.

18
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,545
Another five of cord-cutting
and we'll be dead on the fucking carpet.

19
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:08,507
This is a transformative deal.

20
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:12,344
Yeah, but, uh, just obviously,
this is not okay.

21
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:14,763
We were supposed to be
inside deal-making.

22
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:18,100
Well, you know, we're moving very fast
and it's all very sensitive, but I assure...

23
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,976
- I think they're assembling.
- Right. Shall we?

24
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:26,358
Okay. How will you feel if Matsson starts
micro-dosing and tweeting about angels again?

25
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:30,237
- Matsson's a visionary.
- Sure. Because he's tripping balls.

26
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:32,239
Well, he has a team we can do business with.

27
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:34,866
This is bigger than anything
you've ever contemplated.

28
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:37,994
It will reshape the company entirely.

29
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,125
Well, if you guys really,
really don't like it...

30
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,086
sure. Kill it.

31
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:49,214
Well, we didn't say that.

32
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,469
- So? Shall we? Finally?
- Wait, where is Shiv on this?

33
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:58,181
- Why isn't Shiv here?
- Oh, because this is just inner circle.

34
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:01,893
That's a joke, I'm kidding. I think
"The President" will be joining us, so...

35
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:13,655
- Yeah?
- "Hey. So..."

36
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,991
I think they're gonna eat it.

37
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:21,413
Sandi is processing, Stewy loves it,
Roman led. No Karl, no Frank.

38
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:24,207
Um, Sandi wants your take,
Gerri's trying to fill your boots,

39
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:27,627
but I don't think Sandi's buying it, and I'm
just following them now to the boardroom.

40
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:29,129
You in the car?

41
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:31,965
No. I'm gonna call in.

42
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,427
Well, that works. Is everything okay, honey?

43
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:39,598
Yeah, I just, I'm feeling
the way I was feeling still, so...

44
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:42,934
What about your mom's wedding?

45
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:47,522
I'm not feeling great,
so there's nothing really to say.

46
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:52,319
Right. Right. Well, maybe
you don't even really need to go.

47
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:58,909
To mom's wedding? Oh, yeah. Fuck that,
I'd never hear the end of it. Can you imagine?

48
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:03,538
So, the board members not physically available
will be joining by phone,

49
00:05:03,663 --> 00:05:07,918
including Siobhan Roy, who sends
her apologies, she's working on strategy.

50
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:09,795
- And Kendall Roy, Hey.
- "Hey."

51
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:13,673
And Kendall Roy who's not attending
due to illness.

52
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,259
- And we're gonna lead off...
- "That's, uh, not actually true."

53
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:20,972
And we're gonna lead off with an update
on the promising developments

54
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:25,185
in the ongoing investigation
from which portion of the meeting

55
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,064
Kendall and Logan Roy are recused. Hence...

56
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:32,359
and then we'll move on to discuss
acquisitions.

57
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:34,277
Is he gonna watch?

58
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:37,531
I feel like I'm taking a shit
in the Guggenheim, y'all.

59
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:40,826
Could we make a note in the minutes
that he's watching us?

60
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:54,756
Hey, I know you. Didn't you used
to be Siobhan Roy?

61
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:57,008
You sounded dumb at the board meeting.

62
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,427
At least I showed up. What were you doing?

63
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:03,932
Brunching with some other sock puppet
girl-boss presidents?

64
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:06,893
You haven't got a date?
Did no one on Raya wanna come to Italy

65
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,854
and sit on your Ricotta dick?

66
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,111
So? Just to say, I had,
uh, Peter Onions rat-fucked.

67
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:18,113
Oh, what a lovely wedding present.

68
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:21,575
The guy's a fucking slime badger.

69
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:26,955
Three bankruptcies, two marriages,
four children, and five shell companies.

70
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,666
He's a big investor in shitty nursing homes,

71
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,961
tipping applesauce down their gullets and
telling them they had a four-course dinner.

72
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:35,046
- All the hits.
- Yup. So,

73
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:40,677
I've asked Mum if we can talk to her,
and I think we should do it together.

74
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:43,513
Do what?

75
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:48,643
"Do what?" Uh, like, ask her
if she should be doing this, you know.

76
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:51,938
It's like, five months since Rory
was supposed to move in.

77
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:53,523
Whatever.

78
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:57,986
Or we can at least check that
she's getting a prenup.

79
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:00,405
You know, there's a lot of shit in there
from the divorce,

80
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,910
the holding company and everything.
And the guy is clearly on the make, so yeah?

81
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:07,203
Fuck it.

82
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,415
Fuck it?

83
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,628
Yeah. Hmm, she's probably
in sexual thrall to him...

84
00:07:14,753 --> 00:07:16,463
he's driving her
wild with his sugar dick...

85
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:19,215
- Nice.
- So, there's nothing that we can do.

86
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:21,301
All right, fine. Let him kill her
for her emeralds

87
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:24,471
and screw us out of the fucking firm,
see if I care.

88
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:27,807
Hey, Rome? About the deal?
Um, I was talking to Karl and Frank.

89
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:31,019
Yeah, no, but you're not really
a part of that, either of you.

90
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:35,231
- Well, I am.
- Well, I can't quite fire you yet, Shiv,

91
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:38,818
because I'm still a little bit scared of you.
But my thinking is, when I take over,

92
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:42,864
I'm gonna put you in the office next to mine
and you're gonna be my sexy secretary.

93
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:44,491
The fuck is wrong with you?

94
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:50,246
I dunno. We're working on it. Ongoing process.

95
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:10,308
Welcome, welcome. Follow me.

96
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:29,703
Uh, just a minute. Hello.

97
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:32,372
- Hey, Mom.
- Hello, welcome all.

98
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:35,458
Goodness me.
Did you just come back from the front?

99
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:38,461
Yeah. Just felt like it.

100
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,464
- It's dripping down.
- It's nice.

101
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,387
Hello, darlings. How are you?
How lovely to see you.

102
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:53,560
Don't you look lovely. So, um, you're all
going to be taken up to the house.

103
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:58,148
I'll be there in a minute, guys.

104
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,235
You look rather tired.

105
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:04,446
Thanks. You wanted a word?

106
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:08,324
Right. Yes. Um, so listen,
what I wanted to ask you,

107
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,201
you'll see when you go up to the house that

108
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:14,706
Peter has printed out this awful sort of
itinerary of events.

109
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:20,003
Uh, the welcoming and the rehearsals,
and the ceremonies, and...

110
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:24,674
and, um, I wondered if we couldn't
slightly divvy them up?

111
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:28,970
- As in?
- As in...

112
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:33,725
your father would rather not,
as I understand it,

113
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,644
be together with you, uh, as far as possible.

114
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,690
And so, what is your son getting,

115
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,069
and what is your ex- husband,
who you hate, getting?

116
00:09:44,194 --> 00:09:46,863
Oh. Please don't get on your high horse.

117
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:50,784
It's not me, I don't mind. It's "Bridezilla."

118
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:54,788
He's got his heart set on having
all the important people at his wedding.

119
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:57,624
- He's such a little tart.
- Well, I don't know if that works.

120
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,252
Please, have a think.
And I'll still see you tons.

121
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:04,756
Yeah?

122
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:10,095
Peter! Come and say hello to Kendall.

123
00:10:14,474 --> 00:10:18,019
- Kendall, like the mint cake.
- Yeah. Pleased to meet you.

124
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:20,146
- Absolutely.
- Okay. Mom,

125
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:23,358
I'll check the schedule,
uh, maybe see you next month.

126
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:25,401
- Come on, don't be so dramatic.
- Nice to meet you.

127
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:28,071
It's gonna be about four hours, Kendall.

128
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:57,308
This is nice.

129
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:03,398
- Hello. Hello, I'm Gerri Kellman. How...
- I am Viola. Nice to meet you.

130
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:07,235
- This is very nice.
- Yes, you will enjoy this place.

131
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:14,993
Italy! Pizza, pasta, and Popes.

132
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:17,745
You ever met the Pope, Con?

133
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:23,084
Yeah, uh-huh. I met one,
couple of popes back, with Dad.

134
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:27,046
He was a real full-fat Pope.

135
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:30,049
Complete Pope. Very religious.

136
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,260
I guess he really drank the Kool Aid, huh?

137
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,139
Wow. It's pretty.

138
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:39,726
Everything okay, Con?

139
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:41,936
Yup. Yeah.

140
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:49,235
Just, uh, the guy from Politico,
uh, asking regarding his piece,

141
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,281
your full name and, like,
your employment history, and whatnot.

142
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:55,408
Oh, right. You think he's digging?

143
00:11:55,533 --> 00:12:00,413
Might be friendly. But, you know,
probably not. What do you think?

144
00:12:00,538 --> 00:12:02,248
Yeah, it's probably friendly.

145
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:05,710
Because journalists are so fucking friendly
in my experience.

146
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:20,391
- Okay.
- Hey. Going to the welcome drinks?

147
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:22,894
Sure. Uh, let me just, um, check on Laurie,

148
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:25,772
and then you and I can put our heads together
on the GoJo price.

149
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:27,941
- Okay.
- It's ticking up, but nothing scary.

150
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:31,152
Laurie, Laurie, Laurie. You just
will not stop going on about him.

151
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:33,154
I think you're obsessed,
and frankly, it's disgusting.

152
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,407
Um, Laurie? We're gonna walk down.
Can you catch up?

153
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:38,201
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay. Cool.

154
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,163
- Okay. So, look, I need to talk to you.
- Hi.

155
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:45,583
- I need to ask you something.
- Okay.

156
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:52,966
I need you to stop sending me the, items.

157
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:55,468
The which?

158
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:58,680
The dick pics?

159
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,600
- You don't want pictures of my dick?
- No.

160
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:06,521
- Okay. Kind of offended. Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

161
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:08,481
- Okay.
- I'm fucking serious, Roman.

162
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:13,319
I'm not so sure, I feel like you do want them,
but you're being kind of typically minxy.

163
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,072
I think this happens
when you're under pressure or...

164
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:19,242
but you need to find
some other outlet, Roman.

165
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:24,205
Look at you, trying to get inside my head.
Don't open Pandora's Box.

166
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,957
There's just more dicks in there.

167
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:39,846
- No, she has a lovely house, quite.
- Yeah.

168
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:41,723
- But it's just all the same sort of cycles...
- Hey, mother. Sorry.

169
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:43,224
- Roman!
- Hi.

170
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:45,476
- Hello.
- Hi, Ma.

171
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,812
- Roman, you know Peter.
- Yup.

172
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:51,941
Peter, Roman's worried in case
I'm throwing myself away.

173
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,360
He thinks I'm in thrall to you.

174
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:55,987
Other way around.

175
00:13:56,904 --> 00:14:00,366
- Well, how you doing?
- Very excited about all this.

176
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:02,577
Yeah, yeah, of course. Me too.

177
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:07,248
And, uh, how's, uh, business?
I hear you're big in the old Silvery Gulags?

178
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:11,336
Yes. Helping to, uh, turn around
a nursing home group.

179
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:15,840
We, It's very rewarding. Come in,
look at the operations, trim the fat.

180
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:18,259
Yeah. He means the nurses.

181
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:23,306
She's very rude. I don't know why I put up
with it. And I'm very rude to you too.

182
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:29,812
- He is awful, I can obviously see that.
- No. No, no, no, not at all.

183
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:35,026
He's actually just your type. Another
in the line of post-dad posh, English phonies.

184
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:39,781
He's not posh. His father's a doctor.
Bought all his own furniture.

185
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:43,868
- He's a grasping little scholarship boy.
- Well, take it easy there, Mother.

186
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:46,537
That's my stepfather you're taking about.

187
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:50,541
He's forcing me into all of this,
this Toscana bit.

188
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:53,086
But he is tremendous fun. I mean, look at him,

189
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:56,672
fizzing away over there
like a bottle of cheap prosecco.

190
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:58,508
Hmm, very cheap.

191
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:07,392
Uh, Mom? Um, well, you know that
I'm not a big one for saying things,

192
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:14,315
but I'm just gonna say, are you, are you sure?
The guy has, like, four kids.

193
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:18,277
- He's got a lot more than that, my darling.
- Oh, great. That's fantastic.

194
00:15:18,403 --> 00:15:20,154
There's a prenup though, right?

195
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,699
- Oh, come on. Don't be so unromantic.
- Mom, just...

196
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,035
I'm concerned that maybe you're rushing this.

197
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,915
So what do you expect me survive on?
Macaroni and memorial services?

198
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:37,088
Uh, excuse me for a second.

199
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:45,138
- So?
- Uh, yeah,

200
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:49,016
she says she can't live off
macaroni and memorial services.

201
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:53,020
Oh, wow, poor old Eleanor Rigby wants to
eat dick and drink champagne

202
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:54,689
- for the rest of her life instead?
- Yeah.

203
00:15:54,814 --> 00:15:59,110
Apparently we're meant to hate Peter because
he was smart enough to get a scholarship

204
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:00,903
and bought his own furniture.

205
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:04,615
What else do we got? Any, any requests?

206
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,784
- Any offers?
- No, not really.

207
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:11,122
There's a sit- down, like a podcast,

208
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,748
- Uh, that's basically like...
- Okay.

209
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:16,002
ex-Globe journalists
who are doing sort of like a...

210
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,797
kind of like the Kennedys.
Curse of the Roys, deep dive.

211
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:24,427
Uh, they're doing Connor's mom, and,
uh, your dad and someone named Rose

212
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:29,223
and then the tabloid suicides.
There's like a kid who was bullied and

213
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,808
was it an accident or did he kill himself?

214
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:34,770
He was the caterer at your sister's wedding,
I guess. You know about that?

215
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,440
- Uh-huh. Sure.
- Right, so,

216
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:39,567
they're spraying requests
around the whole family.

217
00:16:42,195 --> 00:16:46,365
- Maybe keep tabs on that one. Okay?
- Okay.

218
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:51,204
- Fucking bottom feeders.
- So unless it's weird I might fuck off?

219
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,915
- Yeah. Whatever. Clock the fuck off.
- Okay.

220
00:16:59,504 --> 00:17:01,172
- Hey.
- Hey.

221
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:06,969
- Okay. Very nice. Uh, how we doing?
- Yeah. Good, great.

222
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:10,806
- Absolutely. Yeah.
- I'm great. Oh, shit.

223
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:12,308
- Phone stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Sorry.

224
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,185
No, no, uh, go for it.

225
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,526
- Thank you.
- Well, congratulations, Greg.

226
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:23,736
Yeah. Punching above your weight?

227
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:26,030
- Oh, Comfry?
- Uh-hmm.

228
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:31,786
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
I like her, I like her. I do wonder...

229
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:34,956
- Can you hold this?
- Is there depth there?

230
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:40,586
- Like is there substance?
- Depth? Oh, my God.

231
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,465
The man dying of thirst
is suddenly a mineral water critic?

232
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,802
Does Comfry not sate your lust
for wisdom, Greg?

233
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,720
Such a shame Sontag's not still alive.

234
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:51,472
- You could take her to the drive-though.
- Oh. Yeah.

235
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:57,353
Maybe I wonder when she gets to know
the quote-unquote "real me", uh,

236
00:17:57,478 --> 00:17:59,855
- will she stick around?
- Well, I guess either way,

237
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,316
if doesn't work out,
she's a great date ladder.

238
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,819
Excuse me? As, as in...

239
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:09,156
Well, you know, people will see her with you.
And no offense, but they'll say,

240
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:13,077
- "What the fuck's going on there?"
- "Why is he with her?"

241
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:15,204
Yes. Yeah. Yeah,
I'm aware of what you're saying.

242
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,164
- Yeah. Okay.
- It still could work for you.

243
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:20,209
Date ladder. Play the date ladder game.

244
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:23,921
- What about her? She looks nice.
- Yeah.

245
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:25,423
Yeah.

246
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:28,259
- I mean, yeah, why not?
- She's pretty.

247
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:30,136
- She is very pretty.
- She is also a princess

248
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:32,471
- or a duchess or something, but sure. Yeah.
- Yeah.

249
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:35,641
- Why not?
- Why not? We put a man on the moon.

250
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:42,565
- Okay.
- Okay. Wow.

251
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,317
Poor woman, she probably...

252
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:47,320
She thinks she met a fun guy at a wedding.

253
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:49,822
He should be coloured red
like a dangerous lizard.

254
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:53,409
Oh, no, Scary Poppins is on manoeuvres.
Can you, you know, just...

255
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:55,077
- Just block me from her?
- Blocking you.

256
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:58,039
You know, she knows that I'm not
in a good place and then it's all

257
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:00,124
- house of flying daggers, you know.
- Sure.

258
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,418
"How's your marriage going?
And, are you gonna have children?"

259
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:04,754
How is your marriage going?
Are you gonna have children?

260
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:06,505
Okay. Ha-ha.

261
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:10,343
Karolina.

262
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:15,431
"Going to Macao, feeling lucky."
Uh, Tom. Matsson.

263
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:20,311
What? Going to Macao?
Feeling lucky? What the fuck is that?

264
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:23,522
You see this thing from Karolina?
It's off the radar and now this?

265
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:26,984
- Is it, is this a move?
- It, it could be...

266
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:29,945
it could be nothing, you know.
Fucking social media fireworks.

267
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:33,407
- "Going to Macao, feeling lucky."
- Is he, is he trying to boost his price?

268
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:35,701
Is he just rocking the boat
or trying to blow up the deal?

269
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,203
I mean, has he got a good subscriber
numbers coming in?

270
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:41,332
Maybe he's just going to Macao
and he's feeling lucky. Maybe...

271
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:43,668
Hey, Lukas, call me. Are you high?

272
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:47,129
I think you should put down
the venti ayahuasca Big Gulp.

273
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,632
Uh, we need to be inside track
on these Tweets, man, okay?

274
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:53,344
Call me. I don't know, it's like,
it's his thing. He's a, he's a trickster.

275
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:56,055
Okay. Well, sounds cool. Is he gonna, like,
steal our watches

276
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,141
- and saw the fucking deal in half?
- Maybe.

277
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:02,812
- You're supposed to be inside this, Rome.
- I am inside this. Leave it.

278
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:05,314
- Hey, nice work, Rome.
- Hey.

279
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:07,316
- Matsson going nut-nut.
- Uh-hmm.

280
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:10,319
- Keep hold of that shit, bro.
- It's all under control, motherfucker.

281
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:12,113
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Where are you off to?

282
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:14,448
- Naples, score some junk?
- No, just our mother

283
00:20:14,573 --> 00:20:18,119
- throwing me out of her party.
- Oh, nice. Good. Well, so long.

284
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:21,956
Where are my kids? Hey, hey, guys,
where the fuck are my kids?

285
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:24,166
What a surprise? Ken doesn't know
where his kids are.

286
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:29,380
So look, um, I've been thinking,
who knows what'll happen,

287
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:31,716
maybe I won't ignite?

288
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:37,221
Maybe the two party system
isn't as rotten as it looks.

289
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:43,310
But I have to plan for success. So, Willa,
this is a difficult conversation to have.

290
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:46,313
Oh, okay.

291
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:49,150
- So you're okay?
- Uh, yeah, I don't...

292
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:52,153
just, uh, no, go on and just...

293
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:55,239
We can go back underground, you know?

294
00:20:55,364 --> 00:21:00,035
Me in my apartment in the city,
you come visit, it's kind of romantic?

295
00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:02,455
- That doesn't work for me. No.
- Okay.

296
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,251
Maxim had an idea, which is...

297
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:15,551
will you make me the most happiest man

298
00:21:16,427 --> 00:21:20,473
slash most bulletproof candidate in the world?

299
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:23,809
- Oh, okay.
- Okay?

300
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:26,187
No, I, no, I mean...

301
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:30,232
Baby, baby.

302
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:32,818
People are looking, Willa.

303
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:38,532
Well, then I'd be pleased to say

304
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:42,077
yes, yes, yes. Can I?

305
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:45,372
Can I have a little think on it?

306
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:49,627
If it's okay, I'm smiling now.

307
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:52,254
- Right.
- Like you said yes.

308
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,756
Okay.

309
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:55,633
- But take your time.
- Right.

310
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:58,219
- "Grazie mille."
- Wow.

311
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:03,140
- So GoJo's price is moving up and fucking up.
- Yeah. I think he played you, Rome.

312
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:05,142
SEC's gonna be all over this.

313
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:09,355
Oh, yeah, oh, my goodness, gummy love bite
from the fucking toddlers.

314
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,690
I think he likes us, I do,
I can feel that in my gut.

315
00:22:11,816 --> 00:22:14,109
Okay. Uh, another one.

316
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:17,488
Emojis, controller, fingers crossed, eggplant.

317
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:22,326
Maybe he's trying to fuck
a gaming site something with...

318
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:24,578
- Rome, this is bad.
- I...

319
00:22:25,162 --> 00:22:26,872
- I think we're good.
- Oh, yeah?

320
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:29,458
If he blows this deal
then who is left for us exactly?

321
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:34,672
We could become the fucking Pan- American
Waystar-Blockbuster Video dial-up Corporation.

322
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:37,550
Okay. Here he comes.

323
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:39,426
And here she comes.

324
00:22:39,552 --> 00:22:43,514
- He does not give a single solitary fuck.
- No. No.

325
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:46,725
Maybe it's all fine. Maybe they just share
a big bed together

326
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:49,979
and they watch Friends reruns
and drink milkshakes. Oh, hi.

327
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:53,399
- Well, your father made it, it would appear.
- And you know the story?

328
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:56,443
What? The skunk, the porcupine,
and the concubine?

329
00:22:56,569 --> 00:23:01,031
Probably the best wedding present
I'll ever get. But so disgusting.

330
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,576
Is he still fucking Marcia, do we think?

331
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:06,579
- Uh, I think not is the word.
- Hope not,

332
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:09,456
poor old fellow would probably keel over
with the effort.

333
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:15,671
Oh, well, I gotta go around telling everybody
to be very discreet. Oh, and Shiv...

334
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:21,760
- you know about this awful thing later on?
- Oh, uh, yeah, uh, Rome and I have got a big,

335
00:23:21,886 --> 00:23:24,638
we're working on a big deal and so, um,
we just got hit by a torpedo

336
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:26,765
- and it's not okay, I think.
- Oh, Shiv, don't be silly.

337
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:30,352
Go have fun with Mom, I can manage.
She's not even that involved.

338
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:33,272
Yeah? See you later.

339
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:36,108
- You're welcome.
- Fuck you.

340
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:38,152
- Logan, you came.
- How you doing?

341
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,237
Staying ahead of the Inland Revenue?

342
00:23:41,322 --> 00:23:43,866
- Welcome to Toscana.
- Oh, glad to be here.

343
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:46,285
Anything I can do, just let me know.

344
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:52,166
Very kind. When we get the chance, I wanted
a discreet word with you about, uh,

345
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,668
- your contacts in UK government.
- Uh-huh.

346
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:59,214
It's just I'd like to give something back,
you know, the chance to serve.

347
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:02,176
- Logan.
- Ah...

348
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:11,936
- And what did he want?
- He wants me to get the dipshits

349
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:17,441
on Downing Street to make him
Lord Fucking Seat Sniffer Pantyhose.

350
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:20,486
- Did you read the Tweet?
- Yup.

351
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:22,237
- Have you spoken?
- Uh, tried, but...

352
00:24:22,363 --> 00:24:26,951
I'm not used to negotiating via eggplant.
I'm not sure he wants the deal.

353
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:31,205
- He might just run a fucking moussaka.
- You want to try calling him again?

354
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:40,464
Um, okay. As long as he doesn't come here.
No. Hey, hey, you okay?

355
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:42,091
Yeah. I'm okay. Hey, Dad.

356
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:43,884
Ken, he doesn't wanna see you.
He doesn't wanna talk to you.

357
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:47,054
- Yeah, well this is all total horseshit.
- Okay? We had a deal. Jesus Christ.

358
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:50,265
Let's just have it out, okay?
I wanna see you, Dad,

359
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:54,561
I wanna see you for dinner
and let's just nail this, okay?

360
00:24:54,812 --> 00:24:58,273
8, on your own. Yeah?

361
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,735
- He's busy.
- Sure.

362
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,947
- We'll get back to him.
- We'll get back to you.

363
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:09,952
- Oh, you'll, you'll get back to me?
- Uh-hmm.

364
00:25:10,703 --> 00:25:12,079
You prick.

365
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:17,376
- Should I go?
- I don't know, maybe wear a stab vest.

366
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,922
I mean, it'll be okay, maybe you should go.
Get him out of the firm.

367
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:27,428
- You want me to come with you?
- Oh, fuck off. I'm not scared.

368
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:30,222
Get me some rooms,
I wanna get Matsson on the phone.

369
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:31,724
Okay.

370
00:25:41,984 --> 00:25:45,362
- Hello, welcome, welcome.
- We're almost there.

371
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,554
Hello, my sweetie.

372
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:14,933
Oh, my God,
I didn't realize you were so...

373
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:29,073
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Oh, hi.

374
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:32,618
- Hey, just busy.
- Managed to tear yourself away?

375
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:38,707
What do you think of Peter's daughters?
They're both in interior design.

376
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:42,252
- They're unemployed.
- Yeah. They offered to take photos

377
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:44,546
and I think they exported my address book.

378
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,256
- No.
- Yeah.

379
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:52,304
The bachelorette party.
My mother would turn in her grave.

380
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:59,937
Hey, Rome is kind of concerned.
You do have a watertight prenup, right?

381
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:03,649
Do you think he's gonna do me in
for Granny's fake Rubens?

382
00:27:03,774 --> 00:27:05,984
- You've got a good lawyer at least.
- Yeah. Sure.

383
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,613
I'm actually having to open up
the divorce agreement with your father

384
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:13,784
- because Peter loves Eaton Square flat.
- Does he not got one his own?

385
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:17,913
Uh, he had a bit of bad luck
with a salmon-smoking business

386
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:21,208
and he lost his place in Pimlico.

387
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:24,419
Ooh. Quite the business brain.

388
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:28,298
- Got a very big heart.
- Well, I supposed opposites attract.

389
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:36,140
Should we just enjoy a fag?
And not do any sniping for a bit?

390
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:39,518
- Or have you come to get some attention?
- Me? Attention from you?

391
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:41,979
Oh, no. That ship sailed long ago.

392
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:43,772
Yeah. I might have been a bit of
a spotty mother,

393
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:45,983
but you've been a shitty daughter, so...

394
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:53,574
You weren't a spotty mother,
you were just an absence, but I'm fine.

395
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:58,745
I moved back to bloody New York so I could be
near you and I never fucking saw you.

396
00:27:58,871 --> 00:28:03,834
Mom, it's okay. It's fine, you let Dad take us
and it was probably best.

397
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,131
I gave him custody so you could keep your
shares and I could protect your interests.

398
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,674
You chose.

399
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:15,554
- "I'll have the carbonara and Daddy, please."
- I didn't choose anything.

400
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,599
- You tend to get what you want anyway.
- And you don't?

401
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:23,896
I don't think I've ever won
a single battle in my whole life.

402
00:28:25,731 --> 00:28:28,442
I was 10, Mom. I was a fucking kid.

403
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,989
You were 13, and you knew
how to twist the knife.

404
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:39,161
You knew then and you know now.
And I might cry.

405
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:42,206
Oh, yeah, where's the onion?

406
00:28:43,582 --> 00:28:45,751
You were quite a piece of work.

407
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:53,050
You were my onion. You are my onion.

408
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:55,844
Yeah. Well, you're my fucking onion.

409
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:08,315
Truth is, I probably should never
have had children...

410
00:29:12,694 --> 00:29:14,863
You made the right decision.

411
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:17,950
Some people just aren't made to be mothers.

412
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:22,829
I should've had dogs.

413
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:29,169
- Well, you could've had dogs.
- No, not with your father.

414
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:32,631
He never saw anything he loved
that he didn't wanna kick it

415
00:29:32,756 --> 00:29:34,800
just to see if it would still come back.

416
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:44,768
Okay, what's this?

417
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:48,897
Okay, so your dad called a bunch
and Matsson won't take the calls.

418
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:52,693
Matsson hates the phone.
That's nothing, I told Dad that.

419
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:55,737
He left me a voice memo,
the Tweets were just fucking around.

420
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:59,074
His lawyers have given him the Reg FD scares.

421
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:01,535
He's flying back to his Swiss place.
There's clarification coming.

422
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,080
Yeah. Well, your dad thinks
Matsson's trying to humiliate him.

423
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:08,667
Well, he's not. So Dad just
needs to ride it out,

424
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:11,461
- I don't think we need to panic, Gerri. Okay?
- I'm not panicking.

425
00:30:11,586 --> 00:30:14,589
I think you are. Because
you're interrupting a great night,

426
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:17,217
I'm getting very pally with Laurie.
I might try to fuck him,

427
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:19,428
see how that fits into our disgusting mess.

428
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:23,432
Do not try to fuck Laurie. What do you think
about going to see Matsson?

429
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:28,103
- Yeah. Sure, does Dad want me to?
- Yes. Your dad wants the deal.

430
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:30,480
But, you know, they need a translator.

431
00:30:30,814 --> 00:30:33,108
Logan needs reassurance
before the banker meet.

432
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:37,529
Okay, so you want me to save the deal?
Why didn't you say so? Piece of cake.

433
00:30:37,696 --> 00:30:41,908
Save the deal, fuck Laurie,
lead the company into the promised land.

434
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:43,410
Fuck Gerri...

435
00:30:44,161 --> 00:30:45,620
It's gonna be a great week.

436
00:31:09,102 --> 00:31:12,356
Hey. I thought this was gonna be private.

437
00:31:12,481 --> 00:31:16,651
I'm across a lot of shit and,
uh, she's monitoring.

438
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:20,072
Hang out wherever,
you guys can wait inside.

439
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,168
So I hear you were asking
all about the menu and my chef.

440
00:31:33,377 --> 00:31:36,254
Some things are off the menu
for me health-wise.

441
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,174
You scared I'm gonna try
and Jim Jones you with an olive?

442
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:43,970
Well, I think they've brought some food
that's good for me.

443
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:46,973
Yeah. It seems a shame, you know,
Marco's a great chef.

444
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:51,144
So we checked in with your doc
and got the requirements.

445
00:31:52,104 --> 00:31:55,941
Ah. So, what is all this?
You know, I got a lot to do.

446
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:58,652
- As ever.
- GoJo price is spiking

447
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:02,739
and your pal, Matsson, has got a screw loose.

448
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:06,451
So, I just wanted to talk to you, I suppose.

449
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:11,331
Look, I don't wanna get into it all right now
because if it's bullshit, I'll just leave.

450
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:14,876
Can we be civil and not pull our guts out
all over the table?

451
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,587
- Signore.
- Sure.

452
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:20,340
That one's for him.

453
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:40,193
- Where are the kids?
- They're inside.

454
00:32:40,402 --> 00:32:44,781
- Iverson. I'd like to say hello.
- Sure.

455
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:49,286
Hey, kiddo. How you doing?

456
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:51,329
Good.

457
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:55,125
- You like mozzarella?
- Um, not much.

458
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,419
Try this.

459
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:00,922
There you go, try it.

460
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:10,932
Yeah. It's okay.

461
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:16,855
Off you go, go on. Kerry has got something
for you in there I think.

462
00:33:17,814 --> 00:33:19,691
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night.

463
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:26,740
Who do you think I am?
You think I want you dead?

464
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:28,992
I'll be broken when you die.

465
00:33:32,704 --> 00:33:35,540
How's the boy doing? Is he getting better?

466
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,042
He's, he's fine.

467
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:40,837
So look...

468
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:45,759
my thing is, I want out.

469
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,555
I think I thought I was
a knight on horseback, but...

470
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,184
- Yeah. that isn't panning out.
- Life's not knights on horseback.

471
00:33:54,935 --> 00:34:01,107
It's a number on a piece of paper.
It's a fight for a knife in the mud.

472
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:09,533
Like, I don't really know
where my life goes from here.

473
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:15,413
Maybe I could...

474
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:19,376
I don't know. But I can't do Jack shit.

475
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:27,342
So, here it is, I wanna get a premium pay-out
from the holding. Two bill and a chunky asset.

476
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:29,553
Something you can realize
without shareholder input.

477
00:34:29,678 --> 00:34:36,309
Maybe, I don't know, outdoor advertising,
podcasts, I keep Fikret, Jess, and I'm gone.

478
00:34:37,102 --> 00:34:41,273
I'm a ghost, divested, off the board,
complete disinheritance.

479
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,109
Won't even speak at your memorial.

480
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:46,069
We're done.

481
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:49,864
Well, I need to think about it.

482
00:34:51,575 --> 00:34:54,202
Well, you, you already,
you offered at my birthday.

483
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:57,205
- That was, uh, for fun.
- Dad,

484
00:34:58,582 --> 00:35:00,166
we can't do this bullshit forever.

485
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,918
Maybe I want you close.

486
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:06,089
You can do the mail,
keep you rattling around.

487
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:10,010
I can't. I tried, but I thought

488
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:13,847
that I could change things, but I'm not as...

489
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:20,353
There's things you're able to do
that I can't, maybe.

490
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:24,190
Maybe.

491
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:26,610
You've won

492
00:35:27,986 --> 00:35:30,572
because you're corrupt and so is the world.

493
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:35,619
- Well.
- I'm better than you. You're...

494
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:42,250
You know, I hate to say this,
because I love you, but you're kind of evil.

495
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:45,128
Don't talk about things you don't understand.

496
00:35:45,253 --> 00:35:52,344
Well, you're smart, but what you've done
is you've monetized all the fucking...

497
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:56,681
The American resentments of class
and race and...

498
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:58,808
And I thought I was just
telling folks the weather.

499
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:01,353
You've turned black bile into silver dollars.

500
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:03,021
And you just noticed, did you?

501
00:36:05,732 --> 00:36:08,693
- Yeah. Maybe I did.
- Oh, fuck off.

502
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,236
Fine, you know what?

503
00:36:13,114 --> 00:36:14,491
I don't give a fuck.

504
00:36:15,158 --> 00:36:17,577
Not everyone can live this life.

505
00:36:19,954 --> 00:36:22,707
I'm a great revolutionary.

506
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:27,420
A bit of fucking spice. Bit of fun.

507
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:30,548
- Fun.
- A bit of truth.

508
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:33,385
Okay. Truth, okay.

509
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,180
I fucking know things about the world,
or I wouldn't turn a buck.

510
00:36:38,098 --> 00:36:41,559
- Maybe.
- Not necessarily nice things.

511
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:48,692
Look, whatever, let me out, okay?
Pay up and let me out.

512
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:53,530
I don't wanna be you.
I'm a good guy.

513
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:04,833
How long was that kid alive
before he started sucking in water?

514
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:10,547
Yeah. Couple of minutes?
Three, four, five?

515
00:37:11,172 --> 00:37:13,425
Long time, two minutes.

516
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,596
What were you even doing, huh?
Chasing a bit of tail?

517
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,478
Hey, are you queer? Did you try to fuck him?

518
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:29,232
Or was it just the drugs?

519
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:33,278
I'm better than you.

520
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:37,198
Sure. You're my son.

521
00:37:39,284 --> 00:37:41,453
I did my best

522
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:45,498
and whenever you fucked up,

523
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,752
I cleaned up your shit.

524
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:54,132
And I'm a bad person?

525
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:58,428
Fuck off, kiddo.

526
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:00,972
Goodnight.

527
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:03,683
We're out of here.

528
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:26,247
- Hey!
- Hey. How was your night?

529
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,208
Awful. You?

530
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,544
Yeah. Roman implied that Peter
might have killed his first wife

531
00:38:31,669 --> 00:38:35,548
and then he tried to goad Laurie
into talking indelicately about Gerri.

532
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:41,054
Let's have a baby.

533
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:44,015
- Yeah?
- Uh-hmm. Yeah.

534
00:38:45,141 --> 00:38:47,852
- I'm gonna fucking fight, Tom.
- Okay.

535
00:38:48,853 --> 00:38:51,439
Yeah. You don't just get given these things
in a house in the fucking Hamptons.

536
00:38:51,564 --> 00:38:54,859
- Right. Right.
- No. You know, just get given the top job,

537
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:58,029
or ATN. I'm gonna have to fight for it.

538
00:38:58,154 --> 00:39:01,866
Gotta fight Gerri and Roman and Ken.
But I can because I'm smarter than them.

539
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:04,202
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are. You are.
- I'm gonna fucking do it.

540
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:06,788
And fuck Dad, he can kick me
as many times as he wants.

541
00:39:07,163 --> 00:39:12,168
Like ten or five years.
Get rid of Cyd, remake ATN.

542
00:39:12,293 --> 00:39:14,921
- Yeah. Yes.
- And destroy it, raze it to the ground, yeah?

543
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:18,383
- Right. I mean, except me.
- Yeah. Yeah, except you.

544
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:20,260
You know, and Matsson's got dad spooked.

545
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:22,720
So I'm gonna have to find him a better deal,
a bigger one.

546
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:24,389
I'm gonna do it and
I'm gonna fucking nail it, too.

547
00:39:24,514 --> 00:39:27,183
And what, what about me?

548
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:29,727
- In the...
- Together. Yeah.

549
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:32,230
Because we can't let
the dirty little pixie become king.

550
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:34,357
- No.
- Yeah. Blow up Roman,

551
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:36,609
and I'm the only candidate left in the field.

552
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:41,114
Let's do anything, yeah? What do you...

553
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,615
Yeah.

554
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:44,784
- What do you wanna do to me?
- You're so fucking hot.

555
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:47,620
- You're so fucking hot.
- Just tell me anything, do anything to me.

556
00:39:48,246 --> 00:39:49,789
No, you, you...

557
00:39:49,914 --> 00:39:53,042
You say anything to me. Go on,

558
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:58,756
mistress Siobhan Roy. Go on.

559
00:40:02,385 --> 00:40:03,887
You're not good enough for me.

560
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:08,808
Oh, right. Oh. I see.

561
00:40:08,975 --> 00:40:10,351
- Well, let's see about that.
- Yeah.

562
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:13,605
- No, I'm way out of your fucking league.
- Yeah. Oh, you think so? Yeah?

563
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:18,484
- Yeah.
- That's why you want me.

564
00:40:19,444 --> 00:40:23,239
- Maybe.
- That's why you love me.

565
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:26,075
Fuck you.

566
00:40:27,535 --> 00:40:29,412
Even though I don't love you.

567
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,959
But you want me anyway.

568
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:12,163
Hey.

569
00:41:12,622 --> 00:41:14,832
- You crept out.
- Yeah.

570
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:18,294
Sleep well?

571
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:22,757
Oh, yeah. Really good. Lots of sleep.

572
00:41:24,008 --> 00:41:28,388
I'm sorry for waking you to ask,
but I'm curious obviously.

573
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:30,640
Yeah. No worries. Yeah.

574
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:35,353
- Yeah, still thinking.
- Still thinking?

575
00:41:35,478 --> 00:41:39,107
Yeah. Big decision, real life decisions,

576
00:41:40,692 --> 00:41:42,485
- so just...
- Yeah.

577
00:41:43,194 --> 00:41:45,113
- Right. Right.
- Thinking away.

578
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:47,782
Just, this much thinking
could start to get unromantic.

579
00:41:47,907 --> 00:41:49,826
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Just saying.

580
00:41:50,284 --> 00:41:52,662
- Hey. Oh.
- Hey.

581
00:41:52,787 --> 00:41:56,416
- Wow. Is that the time?
- Excuse me?

582
00:41:56,874 --> 00:41:59,377
Oh, just checking the old watch there.

583
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:03,798
I can't believe it.
Um, what are you up to today?

584
00:42:05,216 --> 00:42:07,260
- I don't know, work shit.
- Work?

585
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:09,846
- Yeah.
- Or...

586
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:17,020
Okay, because, I thought, or I've overheard,
that you actually, not to intrude,

587
00:42:17,145 --> 00:42:22,900
but I thought maybe you were part of
the titled monarchical, uh...

588
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:26,070
sort of situation if that's not
too bold to say?

589
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:28,531
No, sure, but I do a bit of, uh...

590
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:32,368
I'm an online brand ambassador.
A fermented yogurt drink.

591
00:42:32,702 --> 00:42:34,579
- Fermented yogurt?
- Yeah.

592
00:42:34,704 --> 00:42:37,123
Well, I've had that. Yeah. It's really good,

593
00:42:37,248 --> 00:42:39,751
- It's a gut cleansing treat.
- Is it really?

594
00:42:39,876 --> 00:42:41,544
- Hey, dipshit. Hands off.
- Hi.

595
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:44,672
Hey. I'm just off to save the world.
Should be back for dinner. Greg...

596
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:49,177
Would you please keep the Contessa company,
but don't look at her,

597
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:51,721
everyone knows what you're thinking
and it's disgusting, bye-ya!

598
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:54,932
Sorry about him.
Lorry, How the hell are you?

599
00:42:55,058 --> 00:42:56,517
- I'm good.
- Yeah. Good to see you.

600
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:59,604
My cousin. A very rude man.

601
00:43:00,188 --> 00:43:03,149
GoJo price has lurched, and held.

602
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:07,612
- Power of the Tweet.
- Yeah. By midweek,

603
00:43:07,737 --> 00:43:10,073
their market cap is gonna be close to ours.

604
00:43:10,198 --> 00:43:12,742
I don't think that Rome can find
a landing zone for this.

605
00:43:16,996 --> 00:43:18,372
You okay?

606
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:23,211
That was pretty spicy pillow talk last night.

607
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,381
Yeah. Yeah. You ready?

608
00:43:27,507 --> 00:43:28,883
Yeah.

609
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,386
Thank you.

610
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:34,931
But it did, it got pretty, um...

611
00:43:36,808 --> 00:43:41,395
it got pretty, you know, when you said,
"Say something filthy"

612
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:43,064
or "Do something dirty."

613
00:43:44,232 --> 00:43:46,651
Yeah. I was just being horrible for fun,
you know, dirty fun.

614
00:43:46,776 --> 00:43:52,532
No. It was dirty, but this morning,
you know, I feel a little, um...

615
00:43:55,243 --> 00:43:56,953
a little afterburn, you know.

616
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:03,584
Like I was thinking more like love beads,

617
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:06,504
or, you know, I'd be a sexy fireman and...

618
00:44:06,629 --> 00:44:10,466
It was kind of got into the realms
of that you don't love me.

619
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:13,052
Okay. Well, what happens in Sex Vegas...

620
00:44:13,177 --> 00:44:17,473
Right, right, yeah, no, I know,
but then sometimes I think, um...

621
00:44:19,016 --> 00:44:23,104
Sometimes I think should I maybe listen
to the things you say directly in my face

622
00:44:23,229 --> 00:44:24,939
when we're at our most intimate?

623
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:28,651
Tom, you can't...

624
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:32,947
Oh, my God, you can't ask someone
to say terrible things and then get all...

625
00:44:33,072 --> 00:44:34,448
That's a bit manipulative.

626
00:44:36,492 --> 00:44:37,994
- Right.
- Yeah.

627
00:44:40,037 --> 00:44:41,706
But did you mean it about the baby?

628
00:44:42,206 --> 00:44:44,584
Yes. Yeah, I...

629
00:44:45,877 --> 00:44:48,546
Yeah, I think so. One way or another.

630
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:51,424
- You know, we should freeze at least.
- Yeah?

631
00:44:51,549 --> 00:44:52,925
Yeah.

632
00:44:54,635 --> 00:44:57,138
You know, embryos survive
way better than eggs.

633
00:44:57,263 --> 00:45:03,644
So we should put it together
and then see where we are.

634
00:45:07,148 --> 00:45:11,652
Okay. And when do you think that might be?

635
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:15,156
Well, I don't know, Tom.

636
00:45:15,281 --> 00:45:19,911
I mean, it's important that
the host chamber is willing.

637
00:45:22,622 --> 00:45:26,334
Well, they keep them for 10 years and then,
you know, you can do what you want,

638
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:29,837
but it's different if one of us dies
or is in a long-term coma.

639
00:45:30,004 --> 00:45:33,799
And, no. That's, it's true, you decide
beforehand what you would want to happen.

640
00:45:33,925 --> 00:45:37,386
And, you know, I don't just automatically
get them if we divorce,

641
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:41,015
or something like that,
if that's the thing that concerns you.

642
00:45:41,307 --> 00:45:44,977
No, I just, I wouldn't have necessarily
thought about all of that.

643
00:45:47,021 --> 00:45:50,316
Uh, well I just think it's smart
to bank some embryos

644
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,276
and then, you know,
we can see where we are.

645
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:56,030
So we could be looking at,
like, ten years? That's ...

646
00:45:56,155 --> 00:45:59,158
Ten years is like two and a half Olympics.

647
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:01,410
When you put it like that it's...

648
00:46:01,786 --> 00:46:05,915
No. It'll get clearer.
I just think it's a good option.

649
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,960
And then if something happens or, you know,
you change your mind,

650
00:46:09,085 --> 00:46:11,087
they destroy them, it doesn't bind you.

651
00:46:13,464 --> 00:46:16,175
I would want you to have my babies if I died.

652
00:46:23,224 --> 00:46:25,977
- Aw, thank you.
- And if you died?

653
00:46:27,645 --> 00:46:29,021
Would I want...

654
00:46:31,857 --> 00:46:33,442
Yeah, I think so.

655
00:46:34,652 --> 00:46:36,153
- Can I think about it?
- Sure.

656
00:46:39,323 --> 00:46:44,537
You know, Tom, I do. I may not love you,
but I do love you.

657
00:46:45,913 --> 00:46:50,001
- You know.
- I know, I do know. I do know.

658
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:55,965
- Well, baby popsicles, baby.
- Baby popsicles.

659
00:46:57,216 --> 00:46:58,592
Don't fall in.

660
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:40,301
Nope.

661
00:47:40,468 --> 00:47:41,844
Do you want me to hold your hand?

662
00:47:42,553 --> 00:47:44,847
- Hey.
- Come on, I'll hold your hand.

663
00:47:44,972 --> 00:47:46,349
Piss off.

664
00:47:50,603 --> 00:47:51,979
Amazing place.

665
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,856
Yeah.

666
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,359
- No?
- I don't know.

667
00:47:57,068 --> 00:47:59,153
It kind of freaks me out to be honest.

668
00:47:59,612 --> 00:48:01,447
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, when I got it,

669
00:48:01,572 --> 00:48:04,533
I wanted everything to be
absolutely perfect.

670
00:48:05,076 --> 00:48:07,578
Now, I'm sleeping on a camping mat
on the floor

671
00:48:07,703 --> 00:48:10,623
until I get a deep dive on
the best mattress in the world.

672
00:48:11,374 --> 00:48:16,337
- So, It's great. It's great, but...
- Yeah.

673
00:48:17,213 --> 00:48:18,714
I'm just not feeling great.

674
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,426
I mean, I'm fine.

675
00:48:24,303 --> 00:48:26,055
- Well, but not really.
- Okay.

676
00:48:26,555 --> 00:48:30,017
Maybe let's leave the little
feely-feelings out of it,

677
00:48:30,142 --> 00:48:31,685
because I'm gonna give you nothing.

678
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:37,108
- Nothing.
- So you got a view here,

679
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:39,360
- of the lake.
- Sure. Water and boats.

680
00:48:39,485 --> 00:48:41,654
- Yeah. Right. A lot of water.
- Have a gander.

681
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:46,409
Hey, what are you worst at?

682
00:48:47,701 --> 00:48:51,580
- Me? Yeah. Worst?
- Success doesn't really interest me anymore,

683
00:48:51,705 --> 00:48:53,249
it's too easy.

684
00:48:53,707 --> 00:48:58,754
Like, analysis, plus capital,
plus execution. It's fucking...

685
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:05,052
Anyone can do that. But failure,
you know, that's a secret,

686
00:49:05,553 --> 00:49:12,059
just as much failure as possible,
as fast as possible, just burn that shit out.

687
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,645
- Well, I...
- That's interesting.

688
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:20,234
I'm not telling you a single one
of my weaknesses, ever.

689
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:22,945
Ever, ever, ever. Never ever.

690
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,989
- That's smart.
- I know. I'm smart.

691
00:49:25,114 --> 00:49:29,285
Because I ream people.
Juice them like oranges.

692
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:36,792
No, look, seriously
I get way too into people and,

693
00:49:38,377 --> 00:49:39,795
and then they disappoint me.

694
00:49:45,342 --> 00:49:50,973
Hey, I'm thinking of doing, like,
a quarterly up or outs at the company.

695
00:49:51,307 --> 00:49:52,766
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

696
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:56,437
Firing people is like 85% of why
I get up in the morning.

697
00:49:58,689 --> 00:50:04,778
But, uh, do wanna ask you about
that Tweet, if you don't mind.

698
00:50:04,987 --> 00:50:08,282
- Oh, that one?
- Yeah. Seriously. Yes.

699
00:50:08,407 --> 00:50:11,035
You got, like, big shit coming your way?

700
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:20,836
Dude, are you, are you asking me
for material non-public information?

701
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:23,631
I mean, I don't know. Were you trying to
give your share price a pop

702
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:27,051
by Tweeting unverifiable information
outside normal disclosure channels?

703
00:50:27,176 --> 00:50:30,429
No. You're not allowed to do that.

704
00:50:33,307 --> 00:50:35,100
- Yup, yup.
- So mean.

705
00:50:35,476 --> 00:50:40,481
The thing I need to know is, do you want
this deal? Are you into it at all?

706
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,195
- Yeah, I am.
- Okay.

707
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,199
I'm just a little Swedish, you know?
I'm, uh, into equality.

708
00:50:50,324 --> 00:50:53,369
- Okay.
- I like getting into bed with people,

709
00:50:53,577 --> 00:50:55,913
but I also like sharing it equally.

710
00:50:57,206 --> 00:51:03,921
Okay. Okay. It's just, I'm heading to Milan
to lock things down with Dad and the bankers,

711
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:05,422
and...

712
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:07,716
The Tweet just didn't feel great.

713
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:11,262
And if you're hoping to just blow this
whole thing up, just tell me, okay?

714
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:16,684
I just wanna get myself
the best of everything.

715
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:22,398
Okay. Fuck yeah. I get that. Definitely.

716
00:52:14,366 --> 00:52:16,368
- Hey.
- Hey. So?

717
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,746
- So I think it's over.
- What?

718
00:52:18,871 --> 00:52:21,123
Yeah, I don't think Matsson's interested
in getting acquired.

719
00:52:21,248 --> 00:52:24,209
I think he's angling for a merger of equals.

720
00:52:24,543 --> 00:52:29,965
- Okay. Fuck. Well?
- So it's dead, right?

721
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,508
- Are you sure?
- Well...

722
00:52:31,634 --> 00:52:34,511
I mean, I don't wanna pile
on the pressure, Roman,

723
00:52:34,637 --> 00:52:38,474
and obviously there are always multiple ways
forward and I don't wanna overcook this,

724
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:41,143
but, in terms of deals that make sense,

725
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,313
if we don't beef up soon,
I think we end up someone's lunch.

726
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,653
Well, thanks, Ger. I'm already
so stressed I'm jerking dust.

727
00:52:51,904 --> 00:52:53,280
You want to tell him together?

728
00:52:53,822 --> 00:52:56,158
I'm not really inside the details, so...

729
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:00,162
Okay. Sure. Well,
it was nice knowing you then.

730
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,664
Yep.

731
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:05,334
So before we get the whole three- ring
circus in here,

732
00:53:05,584 --> 00:53:10,673
just among friends, I wanna get
a sense of what's going on.

733
00:53:11,674 --> 00:53:16,220
Is he a Twitter panty flasher?
Or is he a serious person?

734
00:53:16,595 --> 00:53:20,099
- Well, he is a serious person.
- You're certain?

735
00:53:20,432 --> 00:53:23,686
Yes, Shiv, he is serious. But,

736
00:53:24,103 --> 00:53:27,940
Dad, he, um, he thinks there's value
that hasn't been priced in yet.

737
00:53:28,315 --> 00:53:32,820
Matsson's gunning for a merger of equals.
So I guess, you know, that probably...

738
00:53:35,114 --> 00:53:37,574
- Merger of equals?
- Yeah.

739
00:53:37,783 --> 00:53:41,203
Like he's got 12 of the prime Asian
sports leagues signed up for GoJo,

740
00:53:41,328 --> 00:53:44,331
and he's gonna fold it all in to the platform.
Live sports, games, betting.

741
00:53:44,456 --> 00:53:46,083
It's a fucking growth bomb.

742
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:51,463
Okay. But, uh, full 50-50 board, all stock.
Dad, what, splits control?

743
00:53:51,588 --> 00:53:53,006
Yes, Siobhan.

744
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,719
Well, I don't think, Dad?

745
00:54:01,181 --> 00:54:02,933
But the guy isn't a fuckhead?

746
00:54:04,101 --> 00:54:06,520
No. The Tweeting was a move.

747
00:54:06,645 --> 00:54:09,481
Well, he's not some big baby
who shits for clicks?

748
00:54:09,606 --> 00:54:13,235
No. No. He's on the snake.
You know, I know people, Dad.

749
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,778
I'm a people sniffer.

750
00:54:14,903 --> 00:54:18,949
Because I can win any bout with a boxer fuck,
but I don't know how to knock out a clown.

751
00:54:19,074 --> 00:54:22,035
He's not a clown. He's a motherfucker.
It's what you would have done, right?

752
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:23,829
He just maximized his leverage.

753
00:54:23,954 --> 00:54:26,123
Yeah, but "merger of equals?" Like...

754
00:54:26,248 --> 00:54:28,208
- No such thing.
- Always a top dog, right?

755
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:32,796
Sure. And I mean he wants the label, but

756
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:35,132
I think we could still be
the puppy fuckers here?

757
00:54:35,299 --> 00:54:39,094
The family stake will be seriously diluted.

758
00:54:39,595 --> 00:54:42,514
I think he'd let us craft it so that
we keep balance of the board.

759
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:45,517
I think he just wants the freedom
and the status.

760
00:54:45,642 --> 00:54:49,146
GoJo Royco. I mean, who gives a fuck?
Let him have the logo, we take the wheel.

761
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:52,733
Yeah, I mean, it would be real scale.

762
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:57,154
It's a legitimate way of staying relevant.

763
00:54:57,863 --> 00:55:00,741
It's a big upheaval.

764
00:55:00,866 --> 00:55:03,118
Yeah, I mean the top team will, they'll...

765
00:55:03,243 --> 00:55:05,579
You know, you'll be obviously be
fighting for your lives.

766
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:07,581
But I'm sure you can trust Dad, guys.

767
00:55:07,706 --> 00:55:09,082
Obviously.

768
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:11,502
Merger's really a state of mind, right?

769
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,339
Dad, Gerri, you stay
with your hands on the tiller.

770
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:19,343
I mean, their price rise, it's real.
It's a proper fucking streamer.

771
00:55:19,468 --> 00:55:23,972
And the future is movies, TV,
music, games, sports,

772
00:55:24,097 --> 00:55:28,685
eSports, VR, AR, betting,
fucking everything, for everyone,

773
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:30,354
and Matsson knows how to get there.

774
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:37,152
- Logan?
- We can't afford to walk away right now.

775
00:55:37,736 --> 00:55:40,364
Must be worth a conversation, son.

776
00:55:40,572 --> 00:55:44,868
Bring them in. Let's get the banker
fucks in here on this.

777
00:55:45,369 --> 00:55:47,788
Okay. Fucking A.

778
00:56:00,884 --> 00:56:04,721
Right this way. This is Tom Wambsgans,
he's the Chairman of ATN News.

779
00:56:04,847 --> 00:56:06,306
- Hi.
- Hi.

780
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:07,808
- Hello. How are you?
- Good.

781
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:11,937
- How are you?
- Shiv Roy, President of Domestic Operations.

782
00:56:12,062 --> 00:56:14,439
- Glad you're here. Gerri Kellman.
- Sit wherever you're comfortable.

783
00:56:15,691 --> 00:56:17,276
Nice to meet you.

784
00:56:48,807 --> 00:56:50,183
I need five.

785
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,897
Dad?

786
00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:06,033
Uh, Jesus. Fuck.
Um, yeah, that's his dick.

787
00:57:06,158 --> 00:57:10,579
He's sent you a picture of
his dick by mistake.

788
00:57:10,746 --> 00:57:12,247
Well, it's pretty obvious.

789
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,752
Yeah, he meant to send it to Gerri.

790
00:57:19,129 --> 00:57:20,505
I don't get it.

791
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:26,845
Well, honestly, he's weird about Gerri,

792
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:32,059
everyone knows it. And frankly,
I think it's fucking disgusting.

793
00:57:32,976 --> 00:57:34,937
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

794
00:57:35,228 --> 00:57:38,982
Yeah, Gerri is probably just
not stopping it for leverage.

795
00:57:39,107 --> 00:57:40,734
You know, banking it as ammo.

796
00:57:42,152 --> 00:57:44,404
Isn't he just Roman being Roman?

797
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,367
No.

798
00:57:49,451 --> 00:57:52,204
No, I mean, no, I think it's a

799
00:57:53,246 --> 00:57:55,916
potential problem.
There's issues, you know?

800
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:59,127
Everyone says he used to get jerked off
by his personal trainer.

801
00:57:59,252 --> 00:58:03,757
And now there's this Gerri thing.
It's a track record, you know?

802
00:58:03,882 --> 00:58:09,346
- So I think, you know, moving forward...
- Okay, okay. Okay. Well, thank you.

803
00:58:09,888 --> 00:58:12,224
- Thank you, Pinkie. Uh, go on.
- Okay.

804
00:58:12,766 --> 00:58:15,018
- Roman!
- Jesus, fuck.

805
00:58:18,647 --> 00:58:21,608
- Hey, put in a good word for you.
- Thanks.

806
00:58:36,373 --> 00:58:39,418
- Are you a sicko? What is this?
- Oh, Jesus.

807
00:58:39,543 --> 00:58:41,503
- Why do you send them?
- God, it's just, you know,

808
00:58:41,628 --> 00:58:44,756
it's like, "Here's my dick."

809
00:58:45,674 --> 00:58:47,884
Oh, what? Like a fuck you?

810
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:50,679
People just send each other pics
of their dicks.

811
00:58:50,804 --> 00:58:54,349
- People send each other pics of their dicks?
- Yeah. Have you heard of dick pics, Dad?

812
00:58:54,474 --> 00:58:59,438
Well, we do publish a number of popular
newspapers, so yes, son,

813
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:04,234
we probably invented the fucking words.
But why?

814
00:59:07,195 --> 00:59:10,240
Why? I don't know. It's just like,
here's my dick, I guess.

815
00:59:13,452 --> 00:59:14,828
You got a problem?

816
00:59:16,621 --> 00:59:19,249
What happened to that nice
piece of tail you were with?

817
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:24,796
Tabitha? Yeah, she's amazing.
We're having some issues and, um...

818
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,799
What interests you in Gerri exactly?

819
00:59:27,924 --> 00:59:30,594
Jesus, Dad. I'm fucking, I'm screwing around!

820
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:33,388
I don't like things going on
I don't know about.

821
00:59:34,014 --> 00:59:40,062
She's a million years old. It's fucking
disgusting. You're a laughingstock.

822
00:59:40,395 --> 00:59:43,398
Oh, go on. Oh, go on, fuck off.

823
00:59:49,863 --> 00:59:51,323
So like what happens now?

824
00:59:51,656 --> 00:59:54,785
I don't want her hanging around
like frozen fucking piss.

825
00:59:55,786 --> 01:00:00,665
Gerri? Uh, I'm not a radical feminist, Dad,

826
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:05,045
but I think perhaps we should not fire her
for receiving pictures of my dick.

827
01:00:07,964 --> 01:00:09,341
Are you gonna come back?

828
01:00:18,975 --> 01:00:22,187
Sorry about all this, Gerri.
It's just something I wanna get, you know,

829
01:00:22,312 --> 01:00:26,900
really clear about what's going on, you know?
And most importantly, to see if you're okay.

830
01:00:27,025 --> 01:00:30,862
- Uh-huh. It's not a big deal.
- Okay. Yeah, I just wanna get things clear...

831
01:00:31,029 --> 01:00:33,949
for my dad, you know?
God, this must be so hard for you.

832
01:00:34,366 --> 01:00:36,076
- It's fine.
- Do you wanna...

833
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:43,333
No? Okay. So has this or something
like this happened before?

834
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:45,335
I can't recall.

835
01:00:46,294 --> 01:00:49,589
And if it did, did you ask him to stop?

836
01:00:50,465 --> 01:00:54,678
Let's talk about this tomorrow, okay?
I just need to check in with some people.

837
01:00:54,803 --> 01:00:56,596
Okay. Well, sure. I mean, it's not...

838
01:00:57,514 --> 01:01:02,686
It's not as if you were welcoming these
items, were you, Gerri?

839
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:04,187
Shiv.

840
01:01:04,855 --> 01:01:07,440
Look, it's just something for your wellbeing
we need to get really clear about,

841
01:01:07,566 --> 01:01:10,902
because, you know,
with all this potential upheaval,

842
01:01:11,027 --> 01:01:13,488
and you being in such a delicate position
as interim CEO,

843
01:01:13,613 --> 01:01:17,117
if you can't deal with your own sexual
harassment, then it's not a good look.

844
01:01:17,617 --> 01:01:18,994
I can cope.

845
01:01:19,536 --> 01:01:22,747
Okay. So do you wanna make a formal
complaint against him regarding this?

846
01:01:22,873 --> 01:01:24,541
Well, that's for me to decide.

847
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:29,045
I just think, Gerri, that you should report
him to HR, because if you don't,

848
01:01:29,171 --> 01:01:32,507
it could be argued that
you welcomed these photos,

849
01:01:33,258 --> 01:01:35,468
and that just undermines
your position. It's just...

850
01:01:35,594 --> 01:01:37,554
That's my concern for you here.

851
01:01:38,263 --> 01:01:40,599
I wonder if we shouldn't just kick this
all the way up to the board?

852
01:01:42,934 --> 01:01:45,228
Well, thank you for giving this
so much thought.

853
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:48,273
- And, uh, I'll think it over, okay?
- Okay.

854
01:01:48,398 --> 01:01:50,859
- So I'll see you back inside.
- Let me know.

855
01:02:33,151 --> 01:02:35,820
Hey, Dad, I think I'm gonna head
inside with Soph.

856
01:02:35,946 --> 01:02:37,322
Okay, buddy.
