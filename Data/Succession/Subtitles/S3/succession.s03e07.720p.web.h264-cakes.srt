1
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,636
Thank you, that looks good.

2
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:19,561
"If you search
for tenderness It isn't hard to find"

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,065
"You can have the love you need to live"

4
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:32,574
"But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind"

5
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:39,289
It always seems to be So hard to give"

6
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:45,837
"Honesty is such a lonely word"

7
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:51,134
"Everyone is so untrue"

8
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,930
Yeah, I think we're good. That's good.

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,267
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,977
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:05,232
- I mean, yeah. Pretty good, man.
- That means it's funny, right?

12
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,400
I think good.

13
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,279
And then you're gonna do the...
Your whole, like, thing?

14
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,533
Yeah, yeah. I mean fuck it,
right? Just fucking go nut-nut.

15
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,160
Pure excess, full bore, yeah?

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,248
- Yeah.
- What? No?

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,584
No... Yeah, I th... I think.

18
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,878
No, it's like I've gone anti-fragile.

19
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,216
I can... I can accommodate anything.
If I start second guessing, it collapses.

20
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,303
Right. I think that is right.

21
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,223
This is the full fucking thing.

22
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,560
It's gonna be epic.
This is the full fucking thing.

23
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,580
We're good, right? All makes sense?

24
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,918
Mmm. Uh-hmm.
Oh, yeah, this is great work, Rome.

25
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,963
Well, obviously the main thing
is the organizational cultural thing.

26
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,257
- Hmm. Uh-hmm.
- I think, you know,

27
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,385
everyone agrees that GoJo makes sense.

28
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,095
No one needs persuading of that.

29
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,349
Ah, well, kind of regret staying
up all night with my assholes then.

30
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,061
No. It's just about, you know,
us here who get it,

31
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,189
oiling the wheels
and making sure there's no friction.

32
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,109
Well, of course. I mean, I would
say we could handle the human stuff

33
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,027
without too much issue.
That needn't concern us,

34
00:03:56,152 --> 00:04:00,156
that actually comes naturally to some of us.
Which is why...

35
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,451
...I focused on
integration benefits and deal detail.

36
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,704
Great. Yeah. I'm just saying, big picture.

37
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,540
Well, big picture is
made from small details so...

38
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,834
Guys, guys, honestly, it's just nerves.

39
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,295
You've done really great work.
Let's go and help your dad make the deal.

40
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,298
Yeah. All right. Nice rally cry, Braveheart.

41
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,925
I try, I try.

42
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,052
- And you're going tonight?
- Ken Fest?

43
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,929
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't think so.

44
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,598
Uh, if Matsson does, maybe for follow up?

45
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,602
It's gonna be pretty horrific. Your brother
in a port-a-potty rolling down a hill.

46
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,688
I might have to go just to see how bad it is.

47
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,356
Aww. "Brothers."

48
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,316
Oh, fuck you. It's pure rubbernecking.

49
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,610
Okay? What's this?

50
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,988
Uh, maybe Mattson's here early?

51
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,783
Or she's gonna give birth to dad's
baby while we chant a Satanic mass?

52
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,161
It's like he's having
a midlife crisis, aged 80.

53
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,662
It's fine.

54
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,915
No, it's not, Rome, he's fucking
an assistant who's 50 years younger than him.

55
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,002
It's not a crisis. That's
normal. It's the opposite of a crisis.

56
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,254
We should all be so fucking lucky. Hi-ya.

57
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,840
- That's so funny.
- Oh. Okay. Champagne?

58
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,341
- Yeah.
- Uh, did you do it already?

59
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,844
Did you land GoJo already without us, Dad?

60
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,637
We're not celebrating.

61
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,931
Long road ahead.

62
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,058
Lovely long open road.

63
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,728
- Wind in our hair.
- Wind in your hair?

64
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,022
We've had a vibration.

65
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,525
I've been speaking
to a contact with connections at DOJ.

66
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,195
- Laurie?
- Well, we have a number of friends.

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,530
And, the word is, on the down-low

68
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,075
that they've seen everything now,
they've reviewed,

69
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,286
and they're happy with how we're engaging,

70
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,956
and they're coming to the view
that Kendall over-promised.

71
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,667
And perhaps some
men were terribly naughty back in the day,

72
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,878
but nothing systemic, Nothing sanctioned!

73
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,505
It's going to be a number.

74
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,177
- Just a number?
- Nothing custodial. For anyone.

75
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,887
Uh, no prison?

76
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,139
Nu-huh. Nope, we don't think so.

77
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,183
- Here's to us!
- To us!

78
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,478
And to justice!

79
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,313
- To justice. Yeah.
- To justice.

80
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,898
- Mmm.
- Justice.

81
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,859
I'll remember.

82
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,111
Oh, well. I don't wanna go in there.

83
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,489
Well, congratulations, Dad.

84
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,367
You've done it again. It's great.

85
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,745
Let's just hope you don't do it again, right?

86
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,331
No. Lessons learned.

87
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,293
And... And here's to Tom!

88
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,004
Uh, long road ahead.
No premature celebrations.

89
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,675
Uh-hmm Absolutely.
Amen to that! Top me up, why don't ya?

90
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,593
Take me home, country roads!

91
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,387
I'm just gonna run to the little boy's room.

92
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,556
Okay. Okay. Enough, enough.

93
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,100
No more mooning. No more backslapping.

94
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,144
GoJo! GoJo! GoJo!

95
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,938
Well, great.

96
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,326
Hello. Oh-oh-oh-oh.

97
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,245
Hello?

98
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,799
- Hey, scooch over for a little bit, buddy.
- Mmm-hmm.

99
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,806
Thank you, Greg.

100
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:16,019
Yes! Yes!

101
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,856
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

102
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,317
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Yes! Yes!

103
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,239
- Yeah, fuck yeah!
- What? What?

104
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,241
Oh!

105
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,912
What is going on? Wh... Are you okay?

106
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,417
Apologies, Greg,
I may have gotten a little carried away.

107
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,295
But I just popped around to say,

108
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,714
that no one is going to jail.

109
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,300
Gerri spoke to the DOJ

110
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,638
and the Waystar Two are free!

111
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,557
Okay. Is it real?

112
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,709
It... It was good news.

113
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,185
What are we looking at in terms of,
uh, what are the responses looking like?

114
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,438
Uh, I think about
80% of your A list are "yeses"

115
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,149
and 15% are "maybes."

116
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,986
Okay. Well, "maybes" are "nos,"
let's not live in a dream world.

117
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,029
But, uh, who's in?

118
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:55,034
Off the top of my head, it's great. Um,
Dion, Barry, JP, David...

119
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,204
- Nice.
- ...Anna, Tom, Tory,

120
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,457
Jeff, Elon, Lukas, Jennifer and Emma, "yeses."

121
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,252
Chloe is still a "maybe."

122
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,172
And, uh, and the sibs?

123
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,884
Um, yeah, uh...

124
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,305
Okay. No. Whatever. Fine. Fine.

125
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,809
This is fucking cool, Comfry.
Hey, hey, listen,

126
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,062
you have a good time, too, yeah?
Like everyone,

127
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,315
servers, fucking, the imagineers, the DJ crew,

128
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,444
you know, this is highly egalitarian,
like, do your job,

129
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,655
but fucking get your drink on,
get your buzz on.

130
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,449
There's no boundaries if you're cool.

131
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,202
Mission Control out! Shit is about to pop off.

132
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,164
- Woo!
- Party!

133
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,876
It's my birthday! Fuck You! Woo!

134
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,963
Hi.

135
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,925
Hey, hey.

136
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,683
There might be a problem with GoJo.

137
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,686
Okay. Where's Matsson?

138
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,898
He's sent Sherpas. He's not coming.

139
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,862
Okay.

140
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,619
It's off. Tell these kids to
fuck off. Meeting cancelled.

141
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,623
Okay. Well, what's the downside, Dad?

142
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,958
You know, meet these guys,
could read petulant not to?

143
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,586
- If he wants to send a nobody...
- Well, his CFO

144
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,296
and a whole team of, uh, people...

145
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,800
He's going to this fucking party,
isn't he? Huh?

146
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,970
Where is he? Getting his nails done,
asshole whitened?

147
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,057
I think we might have to
court him a little is the thing.

148
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,352
Ah. Nah, nah, nah,
nah. It's bad fucking juju to start like this.

149
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,854
Can we not at least talk to

150
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,482
- the nobodies and...
- No! No. We have other options.

151
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,944
Do we though? This could be our last
chance to avoid the legacy media graveyard.

152
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,531
- Frank's reached out to Nan about Pierce.
- Uh...

153
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,535
What? Seriously?
We're going after Pierce again?

154
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,203
It's exciting.

155
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,165
Okay. That's it. Everyone back to work.

156
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,337
The deal makes sense. It's a great deal,

157
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,631
but he won't make the deal
because he's an arrogant prick.

158
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,843
Fine. Matsson's
an asshole. Fucking of course he is.

159
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,262
But do we burn
our only parachute because of that?

160
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,389
It's just smart business, Shiv.

161
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,307
I don't wanna pay over the odds.

162
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,936
And eventually,
the market will make him make the deal.

163
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,188
Unless someone makes a better offer first.

164
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,942
Yeah, Dad, this is it. We have a scale issue.

165
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,571
Our streaming platform is for shit. And...
and we have nothing that looks like growth.

166
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,699
This gets us consequentially into streaming,
it gets us into sports betting,

167
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,743
it gets us into social media.
We have a little window.

168
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,706
Miss this and we end up being a pilot fish
nibbling leftovers from Bezos's fucking teeth.

169
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,209
Kerry? What was it,
that thing you said about Matsson?

170
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,045
Uh, thinks he's a genius.
He's made one good piece of tech.

171
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,756
- Hmm. Fuck him.
- We appreciate your input, Kerry,

172
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,050
but "fuck him" is not good tactics.

173
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,052
It is good tactics.

174
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,599
Dad, please, if you don't
wanna talk to Matsson, fine, but let me.

175
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,810
Or let me. Or we can both do it.
He's gonna be at the party, right?

176
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,188
- You're going?
- Uh-hmm.

177
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,315
Can't hurt.

178
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,735
Fine. But don't go in too strong.

179
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,697
This is a black
box and I don't want to overpay.

180
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,574
Uh-hmm. Yeah. Got it. I'm on it.

181
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,619
Yeah, I... I'll reorganize my diary. I got it.

182
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,874
Since you're going,
you might as well give him this in person.

183
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,586
Oh, yeah. Okay. What do
you think? Do you think he'll like it?

184
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,479
No, I just... I feel amazing, you know?

185
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,940
My senses are heightened.
The air smells sweeter.

186
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:58,027
And, you know, it's like I can
see the poetry and all little mundane things.

187
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,197
It's... I... I'm...
I'm gonna get so fucked up.

188
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,366
- Oh.
- Okay. Is that okay?

189
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,159
- Yeah, you don't need my permission.
- Okay.

190
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,786
Uh, like, how fucked up?

191
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,996
- Hi, there.
- Hi, there.

192
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,750
- "Tom Wambsgans! Not going to prison!"
- Wow, I know!

193
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,170
Hi. We're asking everyone
to hand in their coats and phones.

194
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,839
Kendall would like
his present to be everyone being present.

195
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,260
- Yeah. Fuck off. I'm not doing that.
- Yeah, you're gonna have to tase us.

196
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,178
- And your coat?
- Uh, nah-uh,

197
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,473
I will remain coated.
Thank you as is my right.

198
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,601
So come on. What? What happened?

199
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,395
Ranch stuff.

200
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,313
What, a horse
didn't want you to fuck it? What?

201
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,607
- He had a fall.
- Don't say "had a fall",

202
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,776
that sounds like I'm 89. No!

203
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,822
Maxim and I actually got some polling results,

204
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,992
we shared a Cognac
and then I slipped doing a little Irish jig.

205
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,828
Oh, okay. Ranch stuff. Got it. A real cowboy.

206
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,831
Oh, my God. This feels disgustingly Kendall.

207
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,376
- So where's Tabs? She busy?
- Yeah.

208
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,045
Again? Or did you kill her?

209
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,423
It's going great, I'll have you know.

210
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,466
It's just a bit boring is all.
That's all I'm saying.

211
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,387
Okay. The relationship was fine
sexually and you're loving the intimacy...

212
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,639
- Yes. I love the intimacy.
- ...and all?

213
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,224
I love people really getting to know me.

214
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,892
Uh-huh. Yeah.

215
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,979
Like you're the fucking catch of the day.
You're more fucked up than I am.

216
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:21,110
Congratulations! You've just
been born into the world of Kendall Roy!

217
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,904
Okay. Immersive theater.
I mean, I could have consulted,

218
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,282
- but whatever.
- Oh, Jesus.

219
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,535
Uh, so if we've just been born then, uh...

220
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,873
Oh, okay. So I'm inserting
myself into my mom's vagina now?

221
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,543
- Is that what's happening?
- Cold and inhospitable, seems to check out.

222
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,130
I am repeatedly entering my own mother.

223
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,591
Is that... That's not right.

224
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,927
This is my mom's cooch, so you know.
And, uh, you're implying that it's massive,

225
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,889
so you might wanna tighten my mother's vagina.

226
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,100
Hey, Tom Wambsgans, free man, how's it going?

227
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,436
Gregory Hirsch, uh, not going to prison.

228
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,438
Pleased to meet you!

229
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,690
Look at you all gussied up,
you slick little fuck.

230
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,192
- Well, thank you.
- It looks nice.

231
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,860
Yes. I'm feeling good.

232
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,072
Yeah. Uh, say have you seen, uh, Comfry?

233
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:12,036
Ken's PR with the...
the hair always kind of in a messy...

234
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,664
Gregory John Hirsch, you got a crush?

235
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,292
Oh, my God!

236
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,170
What? She seems like a nice... person.

237
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,255
Well, I mean,
she's way out of your league, man. I mean,

238
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,801
it's like a haunted scarecrow asking
out Jackie Onassis. It's a suicide mission.

239
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,302
- Oh, yeah.
- Sure, sure, sure, Tom.

240
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,764
No, no, no. No, no. This is not a razz, Greg.

241
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,976
She's a goddess and you're a...
you're a nine-foot Cro- Magnon man.

242
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,313
I mean, you shouldn't
even be really thinking about her.

243
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,940
You're gonna put her in a tough spot.

244
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,651
Look, I'm not unaware of the discrepancy,

245
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,363
- in terms of our physical circumstances.
- It's a chasm.

246
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,865
Well, I have an initial approach,

247
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,745
which is, "You're like
a fascinating book I'd like to crack open."

248
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,250
Okay. Well, how'd... How'd
you get Shiv? She's out of your league.

249
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,838
- Oh! Testy, Greg!
- Well?

250
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,674
Well, Greg, I'll tell you.
I got a dick the size of a Red Sequoia

251
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,428
and I fuck like a bullet train.
Okay? Satisfied?

252
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,013
- Prove it.
- What?

253
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,976
Okay, so where's Matsson?

254
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:21,814
He's probably standing in a corner somewhere,
monitoring his biometrics from his watch.

255
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,151
Should we just say hi to Ken really fast?
Just to get out of the way?

256
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:28,362
- Uh, yeah. Oh, hey, hey, Berry.
- Hi.

257
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,823
- Where's Ken?
- Uh, VIP.

258
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,825
Uh-huh. Okay.

259
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,501
Today is pretty fucking iconic.

260
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,211
Yeah.

261
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,969
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second.
Who... who... who let you guys in?

262
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,890
- This is friends only.
- Oh. Shouldn't it be empty then?

263
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,641
Beat me by one second.

264
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,810
- Happy birthday, old man.
- Um...

265
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,188
just to say, I'm only here
because I heard this was going to be

266
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:06,108
a five-dimensional catastrophe
and I want to watch you crash and burn.

267
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,110
- Come here.
- Oh. Yeah, all right.

268
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,779
Hugsy. Man, it's like you fueled.

269
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,032
Are you sure you're only 40?
You look like shit.

270
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:19,121
What? No card? I'm disappointed, because
you normally write me such lovely letters.

271
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:23,292
Oh, yeah. No, I couldn't find one that said,
both "Happy Birthday" and "Get Well Soon".

272
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,881
Well, I'm glad you came. It says a lot.

273
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,967
- Yeah, it was a ten-minute drive.
- Uh-huh.

274
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,887
Okay. Well,
give me a hug before you start weeping.

275
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,057
- It's good to see you.
- Hi, Kenny.

276
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,685
Holy shit. Holy shit. Gang's all here?

277
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,521
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

278
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,898
Hey, man, what... what...
what... what's this? What happened?

279
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:50,110
Well, a little overexcited
about a political breakthrough, so...

280
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,154
- Okay. But what... what's with the coat?
- Yeah.

281
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,448
- You're not staying or...
- It's a coat. I like it.

282
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,076
So, what do you think?

283
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,870
It's cool. Can I ask you,
did you ask for mommy's permission

284
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,665
for the use of her, uh, squatch?

285
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,667
What? From a copyright perspective?

286
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,002
Well, it's just,
you know, call me old-fashioned,

287
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,129
but I think
you should ask before you construct

288
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,131
a giant replica of someone's vagina. No?

289
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,509
Roman, relax. Yes,
you can take it home with you.

290
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,929
Okay. So. Go on, tell us. Who's here?

291
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,430
- Who isn't?
- Your dad.

292
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,224
- Your mom.
- Your wife and kids.

293
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,850
Any real friends.

294
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,727
I mean business folks, yeah.

295
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,564
Stewy? I mean, honestly,
we could do with building some bridges.

296
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,567
So yeah, Lawrence Yee? Lukas Matsson?

297
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,402
Yeah, yeah. They're all here. Somewhere.

298
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,320
- Uh-hmm.
- Hey,

299
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,947
I got something to show you.
This way. This way.

300
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,324
- Hey, Will. Hey, Nate.
- Yeah.

301
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,410
Nate, I... I... I... I'm
gonna show these guys around.

302
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,205
Hey, uh, I actually got something from,
uh, dad, and myself, I suppose.

303
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,791
- What is it?
- Oh, it's, uh, it's your baby teeth

304
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,501
and an iTunes gift card. It's nice.

305
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,296
No, it's a... it's a nice
thing. We... we hope you'll like it.

306
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,840
Okay. Let me show you some shit.

307
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,425
Okay.

308
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,306
So I consulted with Gladwell and Harari,
and Lovelock and Popcorn

309
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,767
and this in here,
it's, uh, it's pretty technical,

310
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,229
but this is the best we could come
up with on the likely directions of society

311
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,732
so a little dry, but...

312
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,860
- ...accurate, I would say. Accurate.
- President.

313
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,616
Hmm. Not a bad way to go.

314
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,078
Also, we got people in here picturing
me jerking off, so who's the real winner?

315
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,456
Oh, man.

316
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,210
What if, McCartney tweets this?

317
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,548
This is not... I mean,
jokes are all very well and...

318
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,759
Come on, man, I'm breaking through.

319
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:41,221
Ken, I'm not sure that you're aware, but Conn
is pulling very close to one percent so...

320
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,432
- One percent? Congrats.
- Really?

321
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,061
That's four million people
and it's enough to sway the race.

322
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,897
And I am interested to
see who comes crawling first,

323
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,652
Merkel, begging for me to save democracy
or Soros serenading me from the trees.

324
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,321
You did, however, actually shit your bag.

325
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,324
Yeah, you know why? Because I took you two
fucking assholes on a camping trip

326
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,076
because Dad couldn't be bothered. That's why!

327
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,203
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
- And I ate some bad fucking fish.

328
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,288
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- This is bullshit!

329
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,458
Hey. Excuse me, hey, can we... can we take
down the crap sack Connor piece, please?

330
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,421
Conn? Conn? Conn?
It's coming down. It's a joke, okay?

331
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,048
- Come on, man. Loosen up.
- I'm good.

332
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,509
- Lose the coat, yeah?
- Okay. All right.

333
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,973
Okay. All right,
I gotta circulate. We can check in later.

334
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,642
- Yeah, yeah. That would be great.
- You know, I'd like that.

335
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,145
It's a great night. I'm happy
you're here. Fucking best birthday ever.

336
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,023
- Uh-hmm.
- Okay. Later.

337
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,081
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

338
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,884
Hey. Hey, hey.

339
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,720
Oh, I think there's a line
at the treehouse, actually,

340
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,389
can you fix, please? Thank you.

341
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,601
- What's up?
- Hey, I'm glad I ran into you.

342
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,603
Yeah, yeah, me too.

343
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,648
Right, because I might
have to brief the press against you.

344
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,861
Oh. The... the... the whole press?

345
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,072
Yeah. Just Kendall's
really going balls-to-the-wall

346
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,241
and, you know, you're on the other team.

347
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,411
- Hmm.
- But I'm gonna try to keep it targeted

348
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,872
rather than terminal.

349
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,999
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

350
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:18,212
That's... that's very kind of
you! How... How can I possibly repay you?

351
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,547
- Hey, Comf.
- You are a very fair maiden

352
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,009
for... for such activities,
uh, for such a kind...

353
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,345
a very evenhanded maiden.

354
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,019
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah.

355
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,944
Yeah. So... so dad sent
me something for my birthday.

356
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,487
Okay?

357
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,199
It's a little Trojan mind fuck.

358
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,952
He's trying to slip a maggot
in the candy apple.

359
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,496
He's offering to buy me
out of my share in the company.

360
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:58,460
Okay. Wow. Like
what is that? In terms of a number?

361
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,380
Two bill. But, it's a mind game.

362
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,801
He's just... he's worried I'm not gonna
let him keep on living rent free up here.

363
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,930
- And?
- And fuck him. Right?

364
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:15,185
Maybe I refuse to engage.
Mind game that, motherfucker.

365
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,356
Yeah. That's great. But...

366
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:25,028
maybe you do take it.

367
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,448
Maybe, I don't know.

368
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,409
Yeah, may... maybe... maybe...

369
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:37,124
maybe I buy
you a diamond the size of the Ritz-Carlton

370
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,251
and a few illustrious newspapers.

371
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,211
The Globe and Mail, the LA Times,

372
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,423
I print a front page of my dad
eating dog dick every day for a year.

373
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,342
And we're living in Marrakesh

374
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:52,097
and I'm fucking you and smoking hash
and learning how to turn a lathe?

375
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,146
Um, all good. But do we know
where Lukas Matsson is right now?

376
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,608
Shiv and Roman have been
asking staff for Matsson's location

377
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:06,236
and inquiring discreetly about
a private meeting space. Is that okay?

378
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,992
Okay.

379
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,788
Okay. Uh, can...
can the party team get eyes on Matsson

380
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,790
and ask him to meet me in the treehouse?

381
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:23,045
Sure. Um, can you... Can
you find Lukas Matsson and tell...

382
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,883
- Hey, I have a location.
- Oh, great. Let's go!

383
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,468
- But don't fuck this, yeah?
- Oh, come on.

384
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,219
- Easy. No.
- Please, where are we going?

385
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,721
Upstairs.

386
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,350
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

387
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,811
I don't know. I think a 40-year-old man
who rebuilds his childhood treehouse

388
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,189
should immediately
go on the sex offender registry.

389
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,151
Hey. Are you letting me in or what's the deal?

390
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,861
- Do you have a rainbow band?
- Yes, I'm...

391
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,113
I'm... I'm a walking rainbow band.

392
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,698
- There he is.
- Oh, hey.

393
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,367
- Hey.
- Okay.

394
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,118
- This guy's not letting us in.
- You done downstairs?

395
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,246
Yeah. We are done. Hey, Ken, may
we please step inside your mental disorder?

396
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,831
- Good one.
- Thanks.

397
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,417
- Okay. So... What?
- Um, sorry.

398
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,544
- That's not possible.
- Okay. Why?

399
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:10,300
Yeah, well, because the thing is,
the treehouse is cool and you're not cool.

400
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,887
Oh, wow, yes. The coolest grown-man's
treehouse I've seen in quite a while.

401
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,350
Okay. Okay. No, seriously, guys,
just come over... come over here for a second.

402
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,851
- Okay.
- Let's go over here.

403
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,645
Just one second.

404
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,858
- Sorry, but, like, so joking aside...
- Great jokes.

405
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,444
There is actually a real issue here...

406
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,698
...and I need to be discreet
because there's a lot of celebrities around

407
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,993
and if you guys
were in the treehouse, it kinda...

408
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,955
kinda wouldn't
feel like the treehouse, you know?

409
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,000
- You're a Nazi lover.
- Oh.

410
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,584
- And you're a Nazi lover.
- Uh-hmm.

411
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,253
And I'm a defender of liberal democracy.

412
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,840
And this here is made
from George Washington's cherry tree, so...

413
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,217
- The fuck?
- Are you actually not gonna let us in?

414
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,554
Or are you just gonna bullshit
us a little bit before you let us in?

415
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,556
To see Matsson?

416
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,561
That's why you're here.
You're trying to push a deal here.

417
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,813
Who fucking gives a shit? Like what's
the difference? I just wanna talk to him.

418
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,315
High-quality personal conduct.
Really top rank.

419
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,276
What's the difference?
I wanna talk to him. So what?

420
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,403
Yeah. And you know
what happens if we do talk to him,

421
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,196
either we strike out and nothing.

422
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,741
Or we succeed,
Waystar benefits and your net worth

423
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,201
- goes up by several hundred million dollars.
- You're welcome.

424
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:22,330
Right. But I have to weigh that against the
consideration that "no losers are allowed."

425
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,041
- Okay. I'm going in. This is fucking stupid.
- Hey, bro, bro.

426
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,917
- This is dumb. Hey, hey, look at him!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

427
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:30,297
Oh, my God. Did you see
that? I just got moved. Um, all right.

428
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,798
- No, no, no. No, no, no. Bro.
- It's like, Oh, my God, bro!

429
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,300
What? What is this? Are you actually gonna...

430
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,801
- what, stop me?
- You're getting worked up about a treehouse.

431
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,636
- Yeah.
- You know how ridiculous that is?

432
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,138
Hey, come on in. Wristband him.

433
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,849
Yeah, wristband this guy. Uh,
what's his name? What is his name? Who is he?

434
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,851
- No idea.
- Good. So good. So good.

435
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,645
See these two? Don't let these two in, okay?

436
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,939
- Yeah.
- This is my treehouse.

437
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,275
- You shouldn't be anywhere near here!
- Uh-hmm.

438
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,487
- What is happening?
- Oh, hey, thanks for the offer, Rome.

439
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,324
Really cool. Great
head-fuck from you and Dad, thanks.

440
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,993
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

441
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,536
- What's he talking about? What offer?
- Oh, I hope he fucking dies.

442
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,705
What? Oh, God. That's nothing.

443
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,791
- What is it?
- It's... no. It's a...

444
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,710
it's a... it's a little move to
ease him out of the holding company.

445
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,588
- You and Dad?
- Well, he can only sell to family, right,

446
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,381
and, yeah, I think dad put my name on there.
It's housekeeping.

447
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,092
- Oh, I think?
- It's a name

448
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,052
- on a piece of paper, Shiv. It's nothing.
- Okay.

449
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,887
- So can I be the name on the piece of paper?
- It's not a big deal, oh, well.

450
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,473
I can't even do anything with it,
it's musical chairs.

451
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,643
I'm sorry. Just, historically, who owns
the fucking company has been of some interest?

452
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,437
Dad and I handled it. What,
you wanna figure out the financing?

453
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,980
- "Dad and I handled it"?
- So... Yeah.

454
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,149
Wow. Oh, that's cute.

455
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,693
Yeah, I love that. It's great.

456
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,780
No, it's just fucking great.
Fuck you. Fuck this.

457
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,416
There he is.
Lukas Matsson. The Odin of coding.

458
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,336
My man, my myth, my fucking monolith.
What's up, bro?

459
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,921
- How are you?
- You having a good time?

460
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,215
- Do I look like I'm having a good time?
- No, you do not.

461
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,925
I am not.

462
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,177
Still haven't figured out the socials, huh?

463
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,471
Dude, you should
get your Algo Guy to fix your code.

464
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,101
Listen, heads up,
my siblings, they're looking for you now.

465
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,812
Well, maybe I need to find
an even more exclusive area then,

466
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,314
- like a crawl space or something.
- Yeah. Maybe.

467
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,983
- Yeah.
- They're like emissaries

468
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,318
from the Grand Old Duke of Old.
Dad wants to buy you

469
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,904
so he sent his winged dildos to schmooze.

470
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,534
I shouldn't say anything. Even
the look on my face is commercially sensitive.

471
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,037
But it makes no sense, correct?

472
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,998
Amtrak buys Tesla.

473
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,251
- I mean, if anything, you should buy him.
- You think?

474
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:35,380
Huh. Well, I really
appreciate your impartial read.

475
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,384
- Yeah.
- Uh, Rava wants to say hi.

476
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,929
Sure. Not right now. When I'm ready.

477
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,431
Okay.

478
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,267
Listen, you should stay up here, okay?

479
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,686
So you don't get networked to fuck.

480
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,189
Uh, you need anything? What can I get you?

481
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,149
Privacy, pussy, pasta.

482
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,736
Done. Reece can help you out.
Like pussy, coke,

483
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,322
wristwatches, fucking garganelli,

484
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,576
he's like a one-man dark web.
Yo, Reece, Reece,

485
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,578
customer for your candy store, man.

486
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,998
He's not a good guy. Enjoy.

487
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,920
Thank you.

488
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,215
Yeah, thanks. Hey
they said you were looking for me?

489
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,217
- Hey. Yeah. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

490
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:24,763
I, uh, I just wanted to say hi before,
you know, everyone's too high.

491
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,514
Right.

492
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,726
Uh, we... we, uh, might go soon, so...

493
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,103
Well, you can't go. No, no.
I'm doing... I'm doing

494
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,855
- a whole thing.
- Oh.

495
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,523
And we got the Tiny Wu Tang Clan.

496
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,360
These... these kids
we found that do Wu Tang covers.

497
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,695
It's... it's better than it sounds. Trust me.

498
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,280
Okay.

499
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,949
What? Are you not enjoying it?

500
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:48,662
Yeah. No, it's... it's a... It's
a lot of people. It's... it's huge.

501
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,581
Wow. Savage. What you gonna do for yours?

502
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,751
Just Sarah and Orla and some,
uh, some pasta alfredo?

503
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,380
Three glasses of Chablis if you're
feeling naughty and lights out by 11?

504
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,007
That actually sounds really nice to me.

505
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,842
- Right.
- Uh-hmm. But listen, um,

506
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,803
Gary, you... you know Gary.

507
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,805
- Yeah. Yeah. I... I know... I know Gary.
- Okay.

508
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,767
Nice little poseable action figure.
Does he have any genitals?

509
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,186
- Oh, yes, yes. He does.
- Yes.

510
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,314
Mmm-hmm. Gary has, uh, an early start, so...

511
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,608
Okay. Gary's gotta be fresh for the big meet!

512
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:22,696
Okay. Uh, thank you. Happy birthday.

513
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,490
Um, oh, did you,
uh, did you get the kids' present?

514
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,576
- They've... they've made something for you.
- What? No.

515
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,997
They made me something? No,
I didn't... that didn't get to me.

516
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:35,292
What... when? When you arrived,
who... who did you give it to?

517
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,044
We... yeah, we... I don't
know. We left it with one of the people.

518
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,255
They said they would give it to you, but...

519
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,090
- Fine. Okay. No, I'll... I'll find it.
- Yeah.

520
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:46,678
I'm gonna find it because it'll be logged.
What did it... what did it look like?

521
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,056
- Um, like... like a present. It had...
- Like a present...

522
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,100
It had rabbit wrapping paper.

523
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,810
All right. Got it.

524
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,896
Fine. Uh... ...thank... thanks for coming.

525
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,398
Yeah.

526
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:03,528
You know, I might
be getting out from the firm finally.

527
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,031
So we'll... we should... we'll talk more.

528
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,283
It's great actually because maybe,
you know, they'll, uh,

529
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,535
stop sending their goons to the park

530
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:15,123
to talk to the nanny about how
often you lose your temper with the kids.

531
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,962
Sorry. Obviously...
obviously that's not... that's not cool.

532
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:25,342
I'll... I'll... I'll handle it. I'm sorry.

533
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,635
I'm... I'm sorry,
I didn't mean... uh... on your birthday.

534
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,013
- You wanna burst my birthday bubble?
- I didn't.

535
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,514
- Well, good job.
- Okay.

536
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,017
Okay. Uh, rabbits, rabbit paper.

537
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,602
- Rabbits.
- Got it.

538
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,067
Give my love to Kevin.

539
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,277
Gary.

540
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:52,077
Why didn't that get to me?
Can we trace that gift, please?

541
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,079
- Priority one.
- Yes. Absolutely.

542
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,166
Hey, cool shoes, man. Orthopedics?

543
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,964
Are they playing from
the approved playlist in the main room?

544
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,009
Because my... my... my
thing was all bangers all the time.

545
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,512
- Yeah? All bangers all the time.
- I... think so.

546
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,806
- Yeah?
- They're stopping. Let's read the playlist.

547
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,891
Listen, this is nothing.
It's... it's... it's nothing,

548
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,394
but can we... can
we get Connor to lose his coat?

549
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,437
- Sure.
- Yeah, it's nothing.

550
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,190
He's... he's souring the vibe.

551
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,943
And he's making everyone feel cold.
It's not cold, is it?

552
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,611
No. It's at a good level.

553
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,740
Exactly. So let's encourage him to remove
his coat, if he wants, loosen this thing up.

554
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,080
Look, it just... it just... it just... it just
feels like an asshole's birthday party.

555
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,666
And my thing from the very first meeting

556
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,961
was that it shouldn't feel like
an asshole's birthday party. Yeah.

557
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,757
- Hey, Ken.
- Hey, Greg! The snitch bitch.

558
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,427
You're... yeah. Well,

559
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,807
uh, I've had too much, uh, can I have one...
one moment with you?

560
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,559
I'm about to do my set, so...

561
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,519
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Let's... let's ride.

562
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,189
Um, yeah, I...
I was wondering about something because, uh,

563
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,944
I was just about to ask Comfry out
and then she said this slightly worrying thing

564
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,072
about, um, how...
how she might have to do, like, a press brief

565
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,701
You... You were gonna ask Comfry out?
Comfry, my employee Comfry?

566
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,537
Um, yeah. But... but is that right? I mean,

567
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,497
are you... Do you have to spin against me?

568
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:23,960
Because I feel like things are kind
of slowing down in... in that regard, right?

569
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,880
No. And she's out of your league, bro.

570
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,133
Well, yeah, I... I don't see it that way.

571
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,218
What if I wanna ask her out?

572
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,888
- Uh...
- Uh, in... inappropriate. But no.

573
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,474
It's best you don't, okay? Too complicated.

574
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,728
She works for me. Clean
lines. Church and State, okay?

575
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:46,858
Okay. I mean, it doesn't... I...
I don't think it really matters because, uh,

576
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,485
- things are...
- Well, I said no, Greg.

577
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,820
I said no. Jesus, dude.

578
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,989
Duh?

579
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,159
You're like
the world's biggest fucking parasite.

580
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,785
You're a human tapeworm.

581
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,455
Maybe stop feeding on your own fucking family

582
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,208
and try sucking some blood elsewhere. Yeah?

583
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,880
- What?
- I'm kidding.

584
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,549
- Okay.
- Or am I?

585
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,093
I have... I have...
Are... are you kidding? I...

586
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,555
I'm not kidding. Am I or am I?

587
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,851
What's up?

588
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,103
Wow.

589
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,733
Fucking asshole, man.

590
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,958
Look at their faces. So fucking dour.

591
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,044
It's a festivity,
people are supposed to be festive.

592
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,879
It's fucking bullshit.

593
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,882
Roman and Dad necking in the catbird seat.

594
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,136
Did you know anything about this buyout thing?

595
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,014
Why is no one happy?
What... what... what is this?

596
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:03,643
Babe, you're harshing your own mellow,
just calm down.

597
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,193
I mean, that is s... some substantial
rigging. What do you think that cost?

598
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,112
I don't know, baby.

599
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,283
Hi, Connor. I'd like to offer
you a complimentary cashmere sweater.

600
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,118
We're handing them out to prestige guests.

601
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,370
I have my coat. I'm fine.

602
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:27,625
Well, the coat check was
supposed to take that, but I'd be happy to.

603
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,837
Respectfully, I don't trust those things.

604
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,549
I lost a Norwegian Wool in
a fusion restaurant in Vancouver.

605
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,846
Kendall would really
appreciate it if you took the sweater.

606
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,806
- What?
- Hey, my partner is cold

607
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,766
and he'd like to
keep his fucking coat on, okay?

608
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,352
And he's running to be the next
President of the United States of America,

609
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,147
so maybe you should show
him some fucking respect, okay?

610
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,613
She would not fuck off.

611
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,197
Yeah, she did.

612
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,412
Hi, I had to kill a man for it,
but step aside, hombre, let me in.

613
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,497
I'm sorry, sir. I really can't. He said
you're not coming in, so you're not coming in.

614
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,208
Yeah. He was joking. That's my brother,
okay? You can Google it. It's not a big deal.

615
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,793
- Sir, if you could just step outside.
- Wow, are you... Are you touching me?

616
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,421
This man is groping the guests.
You do not have my permission.

617
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,465
You do not have my permission to touch me.

618
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:27,393
Hey. There you are, fucking hiding from me.

619
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,313
Like a human VPN. How you doing?

620
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,358
I'm all right. I'm just, uh,

621
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,527
you know, you can fill in the blanks.

622
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,947
No, I hear you. It's fucking life,
right? It's fucking exhausting.

623
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,575
I just wanna find
a good pussy and get out, you know.

624
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,952
- Uh-huh.
- Mission, side mission.

625
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,581
I hear you, man. I fucking
love pussy. You see my Mom's?

626
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,166
Yeah.

627
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,835
- You seen my Mom's?
- Yeah.

628
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,962
- It's not... it's not great.
- No, um, sure.

629
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,923
I mean, not touching that one.

630
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,175
Um, question,

631
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,345
my old man got
a little bit grumpy this morning,

632
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,138
but you weren't
trying to humiliate him, right?

633
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,684
I mean, everyone says,
I mean, fucking everyone says,

634
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,269
last big legacy content library,

635
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,106
last fucking super app streaming platform.

636
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,068
We fit obviously, right?

637
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,945
- People say we fit.
- Yeah.

638
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,657
Well, I guess I do have one question though.

639
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,367
Yeah, hit me up.

640
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,202
When will your father die?

641
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,039
- When will... when will my father die?
- Yeah.

642
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,541
Um...

643
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,919
Like, I don't wanna be rude, but...

644
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:39,549
what kind of shape is he in?
We're talking less than a year...

645
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,260
- or it's more like five years?
- Um...

646
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,722
'Cause if it's five, that's...
it's a long time.

647
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,807
- Uh-huh.
- It would be better sooner, wouldn't it?

648
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,977
- Right?
- No, no, no. I know, like, we're...

649
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,979
we're laughing here but,
you know, that is my Dad,

650
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,606
- so, you know, go easy there, chief!
- Right. Yeah. No, I... I...

651
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,067
- I can tell that it's a bit weird for you.
- That's okay. Uh-huh.

652
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,028
It's just I...
I don't like the idea of a man...

653
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,282
- hanging over me.
- Oh, fuck yeah.

654
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,451
No, I... I can understand.
Who the fuck wants that? Yeah.

655
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,829
The guru guy who's fucking...
fucking bullshit, you know?

656
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,249
- Okay.
- 'Cause it's... it's not my world, media.

657
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,042
Yeah.
- So...

658
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,171
his death would clear space.

659
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,964
Mmm-hmm.

660
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,841
- With due respect.
- Yeah. No, no, no.

661
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,886
No, no, no. I know.
Um, I mean, like, we're all obviously...

662
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,180
hugely looking forward to my father dying...

663
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,016
but, um, there...
there's another shape to this.

664
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,603
How about you never ever have to speak to him?

665
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:38,483
I mean, you work out of, uh, Austin,
London, Stockholm, Geneva, whatever.

666
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,860
Totally separate corporate identities

667
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,739
- and, StarGo, we burn, obviously.
-Z Yes. Yes. Please.

668
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,617
- Oh, yeah.
- Like burn the codes and fucking...

669
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,952
- acid bath those servers!
- Fucking we can do that.

670
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,662
- We can do that together. Let's do it.
- We could. Yeah.

671
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,456
Absolutely. I mean, GoJo full bore.

672
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,043
I mean, our library,
our firepower, our relationships for content.

673
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,253
And like good shit, you know what I mean?

674
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,590
Like not fucking
gay Moms and wheelchair kids bullshit,

675
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,885
like, popular, actual good shit

676
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,139
and on the occasion that you need
to send up a fucking smoke signal from Geneva,

677
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,058
then that goes through me.

678
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,893
You won't ever, ever have to deal with him...

679
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,312
...or see him, or talk to him,
or hear... Nothing.

680
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,983
And you know that StarGo truly,
truly is a piece of shit, right?

681
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,820
It's a piece of shit. I know.

682
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:28,157
I like to open it just to see how
long it takes for the landing page to load.

683
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,993
It is a piece of shit. Hey,
why don't we, um...

684
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,123
Why don't we just, like,
take a big old piss on our app?

685
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,085
I'm going to open up the app on my phone

686
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,504
and we can stream
some piss on our little streaming platform.

687
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,589
- How's that sound?
- Fuck yeah.

688
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,801
Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,

689
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,387
- twenty-two.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

690
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,431
So I can't piss near other men

691
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:56,018
due to we don't know what reason,
but please, go ahead.

692
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,605
- Don't mind if I do.
- Yeah. Enjoy.

693
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,113
So, I know GoJo is your baby

694
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,700
and we do not wanna interfere
with that at all. You're the genius.

695
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,410
- Damn right I am.
- Yup.

696
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:16,455
So bearing that in mind,
would you consider meeting with my dad?

697
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,627
- Yeah.
- And you'd be interested...

698
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,713
in selling to us maybe?

699
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,217
Yeah, well, if all this is true, then... yeah.

700
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,262
- How's Monday?
- Monday is great.

701
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,347
And if I were to shake your hand right now,
could I go tell my dad

702
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,349
that I basically just bought GoJo for him?

703
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:39,228
No. But you can
tell him I'm in the conversation.

704
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,315
- Fucking A, I'll take it.
- Okay. Take this.

705
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,734
Will do. Are we amazing?

706
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,861
I think I might be
the best businessman in America.

707
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,573
Hey, check this out. Still fucking loading.

708
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,284
- You piece of shit.
- Shit.

709
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,036
Fuck you.

710
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,788
Okay. If you wanna put on the harness,

711
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:01,083
you can tuxedo up,
and step up onto the footrest,

712
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,752
and then we'll strap you in.

713
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:07,548
You'll have 30 seconds and
the rig will fly you up and into position,

714
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,384
you'll have a 3-2-1,

715
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:14,180
and you'll see the green light, okay?
That's the countdown to the intro.

716
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,308
You ready? You ready to crucify Billy Joel?

717
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,104
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'm just kidding. You're gonna be great.

718
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,691
Remember the thing he said
about the rig spiraling,

719
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,987
so just, like, keep still, yeah?
That sounded serious.

720
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,948
Okay. Harness, then mic.

721
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,535
Ready to rock? You wanna get changed?

722
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:42,959
Yeah, you know what?
Uh, I don't think I'm gonna do this.

723
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,587
- You don't wanna do it?
- No, it's... it's...

724
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,465
it's bullshit. No.

725
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,094
Because you did say if you don't
lean right in, it could come across dumb.

726
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,430
And your speech
kind of tees it up with a kind of ironic,

727
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:00,601
"This is the culmination of my life's journey.
To be crucified to save you morons and..."

728
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,062
I'm not doing it. It's... it's... it's like

729
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,065
15 layers overdetermined
master's degree fucking hokum.

730
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,526
Let's just... let's just pull
it. I mean, what... What is it?

731
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,696
It's dressed in a tuxedo, nailed to a cross,

732
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:15,366
singing "Honesty" by Billy Joel?
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

733
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,160
Uh, what about the Tiny Wu Tang?

734
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,872
Ah, fuck. Uh,

735
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,085
I don't know. I don't...
you know what? I don't think so.

736
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,045
No? Okay.

737
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,798
Tell 'em they've got it all
ahead of them. Yeah.

738
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,721
That's a fucking relief.

739
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,098
Oh, hey. Hey, Comf. How... How's it going?

740
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,808
- Hey. Good.
- Yeah?

741
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,685
Yeah, it's good.

742
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:29,106
Ken had me try to call
Springsteen to rescue the vibe

743
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,484
and then that got countermanded

744
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,528
and now I'm working on a jetpack

745
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:37,823
for him to leave
through the retractable ceiling

746
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,659
that takes 48 hours to move, so...

747
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,995
Okay.

748
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,791
Yeah, I mean a lot
of the ideas are jokes but some aren't.

749
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,293
Very weird. Yes indeed.

750
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,300
- What?
- No, me... no, nothing.

751
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,803
Yeah. Ye... Yeah, um,

752
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,973
it's stupid, but earlier, um,

753
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,103
before I heard you were gonna
orchestrate a smear campaign against me,

754
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:11,398
I... I was actually gonna ask you if
you wanted to grab a drink sometime.

755
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,235
Oh, okay.

756
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,571
Yeah, but then, um, Kendall,

757
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,116
you know, Ken... Kendall, he said, um...

758
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,451
- He said what?
- He...

759
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:26,872
He just said maybe not. Clean lines.

760
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,416
Church and State. Wrong time, wrong place.

761
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:32,419
But... but maybe

762
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,798
when... when you're
not working for him anymore

763
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,883
and trying to destroy my reputation

764
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,760
- and, and such...
- You know, I've spent a week

765
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:44,557
researching where to get lunchboxes
from the '80s, to serve canapes from?

766
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,267
Like the one he used to take to school

767
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,519
and then he decided
that he didn't want lunchboxes

768
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,438
and so now I have
all these He-Man lunchboxes in my apartment

769
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:55,276
and I have to resell them on eBay
and his office wants receipts.

770
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:01,448
So if you wanna ask me out, then ask me out.

771
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,870
- Do you wanna go out sometime?
- Yes.

772
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,913
Great.

773
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,751
Wow. She's... she's really dancing there.

774
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,171
Very... very emancipated.

775
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,051
Do you know what she's taken?

776
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:27,725
I don't think she's taken anything.
Just getting the demons out, I guess.

777
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,395
Hey, you found the gift from my kids?

778
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:35,524
Um, I don't believe so.

779
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,236
No? Uh-huh. Well, uh... okay.

780
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,113
That's not good.

781
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,991
Uh, will you give us a moment, please?

782
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,209
They made me something apparently,

783
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,045
so I gotta find it.

784
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,680
Hey, Ken, it'll... It'll turn up.

785
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,974
Uh-huh. Well,
it won't turn up if we don't look for it.

786
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,644
- Well, I know that.
- Sorry.

787
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,771
I'm sorry. I'm just saying.

788
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,316
Where the fuck is it?

789
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,411
Hey, Ken, take a break.

790
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,916
You want my gift?

791
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:39,838
Yeah. Yes, I would. Yes, I would love that.

792
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:56,272
- It's a watch.
- Okay. Wow. Yeah. Thanks.

793
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,649
- I'm, like really bad at presents,
- Thanks, Nay.

794
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,150
- It... I like it, all right.
- Just... just give it back.

795
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,735
- No, I like it. I like it.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

796
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,737
Thanks, Nay. Is it, uh...

797
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:07,199
can I see? Is it... is it... is it,
um, inscribed or...

798
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,326
No, it's just a stupid watch, okay?

799
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,287
I'll get you something else.

800
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:15,833
Do you, uh, want a blow job?

801
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,460
Ha. No, it's just...

802
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:24,008
I don't wanna be a dick but I...
I have a watch,

803
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,469
- you know, I have my watch.
- It's a shitty gift, okay? I'm...

804
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,179
- No, Nay, listen.
- ...bad...

805
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:35,352
Yeah, I'm just trying to get
inside your head and figure out

806
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,771
why you would give me this gift.

807
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,360
Yeah, it's fine.

808
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,655
- It's fine.
- Ken?

809
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,872
Hey, Ken, come on.

810
00:47:56,749 --> 00:48:00,002
Ken, come on, seriously, okay? Look...

811
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,588
- I'm gonna look for that gift.
- Hey, stop.

812
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,551
Ken, Jesus.

813
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,554
Hey, calm... Stop, stop, stop. Just chill.

814
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,097
Great.

815
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,396
I'm sorry.

816
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,565
It's okay.

817
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,196
This is so pathetic.

818
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,326
I wish I was...

819
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,045
Hey. What?

820
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,008
I wish I was home.

821
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,927
Let's go home.

822
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,055
Are you okay?

823
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,432
Yes, I'm okay, Greg.
Why do you keep asking if I'm okay?

824
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:58,185
Well, just... I haven't
seen you smile in, like, six hours.

825
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,396
You don't have to smile to be happy, Greg.

826
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,731
I'm enjoying very much thinking about myself

827
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,651
and my own various skills and abilities.

828
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,405
- Shall we try the compliment tunnel?
- Sure.

829
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,115
It could be nice.

830
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,575
- Why are you so happy?
- Me?

831
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,869
- Yeah.
- Well,

832
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,372
uh, actually, because I, uh,

833
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,417
I have met the most
wonderful girl in the world.

834
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,293
You're just fantastic.

835
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,255
Yes, I am amazing. Amazing.

836
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,549
I mean, it's possible
she's only going out with me

837
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,427
due to, you know, rancor or pique.

838
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,846
- You're so full of grace.
- What's that?

839
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,223
I think he said you're full of grace.

840
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,850
That's a weird thing to say.

841
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,060
You being sarcastic? He being sarcastic?

842
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,312
- No, I think it's...
- He said... Full of fucking what?

843
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,065
- What? What did you say?
- Wait. Tom, To...

844
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,694
Easy. He's just...
you're doing the job, right?

845
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,279
And he's had a little cocaine tonight,
so I think he's...

846
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,698
Dude, don't say that. Don't say that.

847
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,159
I'm a public figure
who could one day run for high office

848
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,870
or lead a Fortune 500. Don't say that.

849
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:02,332
All right. He's a lovely guy.
You're doing great work.

850
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,711
You're so merry.

851
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,046
Well, yeah, it's just... I don't know. I...

852
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,966
I'm excited about my date. I like her.

853
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,926
- What can I say? It's exciting.
- You're the best.

854
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,887
- Thank you.
- Fuck off.

855
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,431
You seem much happier than me, Greg.

856
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,853
I feel happy. I guess... it's not
a finite pie, we can both be happy.

857
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,940
Uh-huh, sure. But it's supposed
to be me that's happy and it's you.

858
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,276
How did that happen? Huh?

859
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,613
I took the wrong drugs in
the wrong order and I can't get happy.

860
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,365
Well, can't you just be happy you're free?

861
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,201
No, 'cause you've ruined it.

862
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,412
- How have I ruined it?
- I don't know. You just have.

863
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,627
- Hey, there she is.
- Hey.

864
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,545
- Hey.
- What are you up to? What's going on?

865
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,672
I heard you were speaking.
Did you get to Matsson?

866
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:54,134
Are you okay? On-lookers
reported you having some kind of breakdown.

867
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,595
People were anxious
that you maybe swallowed your tongue.

868
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,640
- Yeah, I was dancing.
- I heard it looked like a cry for help.

869
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,351
"The Dance of the Sugar Plum Failure."

870
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:06,355
- Fuck you. You spoke to him?
- Uh, yup.

871
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,733
- And?
- Do you mind if I don't say?

872
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,276
Okay, f.... Okay, come on.

873
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:15,614
All right. Don't worry about it, Shivvy.
I'll handle it. You can go cut a rug.

874
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,243
- Rome, seriously, come on.
- I am being serious.

875
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,537
I will talk to Dad and see
if he wants to loop you in.

876
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,413
He often does like to loop you in.

877
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:26,375
Rome, just... just fucking tell me.

878
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,669
This is important and I might need to finesse.

879
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,379
- Oh, you need to finesse?
- Yeah.

880
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,007
Thank you. That's kind. How would you finesse
something that's done? What? By ruining it?

881
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,552
- No, by making sure you don't...
- The thing is that Lukas and I

882
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,762
have, like, a thing
and I don't see how you fit in.

883
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,472
You know what?
If you wanna show off to somebody,

884
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,350
- maybe do it to someone who gives a shit.
- You're having a very bad day.

885
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:47,437
I know that. What, with hearing that you
have to continue to share your apartment

886
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:50,524
with the old meat wardrobe, but, you know,
try to keep your wig on, yeah?

887
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,943
- I'm the one in a functioning relationship.
- Sure you are.

888
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,529
I saw you, you know,
I saw you sipping Dad's champagne

889
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,240
- looking like you were sucking a lemon.
- I don't drink on work days...

890
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,992
- You don't drink on work days.
- because I have self control.

891
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,577
Okay. That's what that is. Okay.

892
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:04,037
I thought maybe you were thinking
about all the dick you were gonna ride

893
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,914
when he was inside?
- Oh, my fucking God.

894
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,126
You know what? No one likes talking
about me fucking guys as much as you do.

895
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,836
- Do you know that? Why is that?
- Uh-hmm.

896
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,088
Is that because you're the COO who can't fuck?

897
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:17,634
Hmm. Hmm. Did you think Tom was going to jail?

898
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,219
- No. I'm happy he's not going to jail.
- Did you? Did you?

899
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,346
Oh, I'm sure you are. You look really happy.

900
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,348
Did you think he was though? Maybe?

901
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,976
There was a chance he was going to jail?
Maybe Dad was gonna go to jail?

902
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,769
Fuck. Maybe I was gonna go to jail

903
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,356
and because Kendall's
that it was all about you.

904
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,609
You thought it was ladies night
and they were playing your song.

905
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,028
But guess what, you're wrong.

906
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,822
All the men got together in man club
and we decided,

907
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,658
sweetheart, everything's fine, so just...

908
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,620
- We got it.
- You know, he is using you...

909
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,205
- as a messenger boy. But as usual...
- Uh-hmm.

910
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,707
you're too fucking dumb to see it.

911
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,543
It's difficult. I get it.
It's very difficult for you

912
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,463
to have to do the dance for Dad
because you just suck at dancing.

913
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,965
- You're a piece of shit, you know that?
- It turns out he loves it...

914
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,176
when I do the Daddy dance
but I guess that's because he loves me.

915
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,888
He loves fucking me,
and he just doesn't wanna fuck you anymore.

916
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,058
What are you even talking about?
You're so gross.

917
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,393
Well, ah,
Daddy doesn't love his little carrot top

918
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,771
even when she does her little Daddy dance.

919
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,024
- Dad-daddy, dad-daddy dance.
- I fucking hate you, you know?

920
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,819
Oh, shit. Look at this.
It's birthday boy. Hey, happy birthday, man.

921
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,572
- Enough, yeah?
- Oh, okay. Yeah. Sorry. Good night.

922
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,534
Neither of you should be in here.

923
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,787
Oh my God, you're right.
Someone call the cops!

924
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,622
Intruders have breached the Masturbatorium!

925
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,667
You're both full of shit.
And you came here to fuck me behind my back.

926
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,460
And you're ghouls and you're disgusting.

927
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,796
Sorry. Whoops.

928
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,339
Can we get them out?

929
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,007
- Oh, get them out?
- Get them out, please.

930
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,218
It's a little late for that, buddy.
I already spoke to Mattson,

931
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,303
who hates you by the way
and laughs at you constantly.

932
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:46,431
- Just stop.
- Oh, what? Go easy on birthday boy?

933
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:50,394
Did you come here to see me at all?
You didn't, did you, Shiv?

934
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,313
Well, look, we haven't been
getting along that great lately,

935
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,941
so what do you think? Surprised?

936
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,945
GoJo was my idea. You stole my idea.

937
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,489
"You stole my idea."
What are you, fucking six?

938
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:06,243
Dude, you lost. No big deal.
No need to cry about it. You lost.

939
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,538
You like the spying, Shiv? On my daughter...

940
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,164
- Oh.
- ...on your niece? You like that?

941
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,000
- Okay. Lay off the drugs, Ken.
- Not a fucking big deal. Who gives a shit?

942
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,086
- We are spying?
- Yes, of... oh, come on.

943
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,089
Of course we are. It's a fucking party game.
He's in Dad's shit,

944
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,341
so we're up in his, every...
everybody's in his shit.

945
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,843
- No. Okay. That is disgusting.
- Don't act like you're fucking clean.

946
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,053
It's disgusting?
What, you're siding with him now? Traitor?

947
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,557
I'm just saying there's a line, bro.
Fucking Sophie and Iverson? They're kids.

948
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,934
There's a fucking line now?
No line for him, no line for you.

949
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,270
But there's a line for me?
You're a bunch of stuck up cunts

950
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,356
who can't fucking bear to see me win.
That's it. That's all this is.

951
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:42,028
You're not a real person. You know that?
You're not a real person. You're not real.

952
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,073
Come on. Why don't you hit me maybe?

953
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,908
- Come on.
- Come on, shitty Jesus.

954
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:50,203
You know you want to,
just fucking hit me. Do it.

955
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,956
"I'm not a real person." Fuck you.

956
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,834
All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Have a good birthday, okay, fuckface?

957
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,335
- Hey, what is this?
- Oh, shit.

958
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,380
- Oh, fuck, are you okay? Happy birthday.
- Easy.

959
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,507
Everybody just take it easy, okay?

960
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:16,229
Take your coat off.
Take your fucking coat off.

961
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,273
That's enough. That's enough.

962
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,026
Take your fucking coat off!

963
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,904
He's such a fucking hater. You're an asshole.

964
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,990
It's funny. It's funny.

965
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,326
- You're gonna laugh at it later.
- Let's...

966
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,328
You'll wake up
in the middle of the night and be like,

967
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,080
"That was funny." To the birthday boy.

968
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:40,629
Hey, you wanna go someplace else?
Like out out now?

969
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,674
No thanks, honey.

970
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:49,971
Okay. I might be up for a while.

971
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:57,103
Hey, Dad. I nailed him.

972
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,231
I am the only child you'll ever need.

973
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,108
You can kill the others. Love you.

974
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:04,694
Hey, you can piss off. I'm gonna walk home.

975
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,713
Hey.

976
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,430
I think the party's over, yeah?

977
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:36,101
Yeah. Just the party.

978
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:40,272
Let it fizzle. Come.
