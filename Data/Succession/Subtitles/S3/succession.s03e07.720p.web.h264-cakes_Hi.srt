-Happy birthday, old man.
-Um...

338
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,979
Just to say, I'm only here
because I heard this was going

339
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,022
to be a five-dimensional
catastrophe

340
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,983
and I want to watch you
crash and burn.

341
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,236
-Come here.
-Oh. Yeah, all right. Hugsy.

342
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,571
Man, it's like you feel old.

343
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,322

find one that said

348

and "Get Well Soon."

349

357
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,481
what-- what-- what's this? What
happened?

358
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:50,110
Well, little overexcited about
a political breakthrough, so...

359
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,320
-Okay.
-CONNOR: Yeah.

360
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,946

You're not staying or...

361
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,156
It's a coat. I like it.

362
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,909
So, what do you think?

363
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,160
It's cool. Can I ask you,

364
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,953
did you ask
for Mommy's permission

365
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,498
for the use of her, uh, squatch?

366
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,666
What? From a copyright
perspective?

367
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,835
Well, it's just, you know,
call me old-fashioned,

368
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,796
but I think you should ask
before you construct

369
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,839
a giant replica
of someone's vagina. No?

370
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,592
Roman, relax. Yes,
you can take it home with you.

371
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,929
Okay. So. Go on, tell us.
Who's here?

-Your dad.

-Your wife and kids.

to show you. This way. This way.

I'm gonna show
these guys around.

384
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,495

got something from, uh, Dad,

385
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,455
and myself, I suppose.

386
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,706
-What is it?
-ROMAN: Oh,

387
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,917
it's, uh, it's your baby teeth
and an iTunes gift card.

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,710
It's nice. No, it's a--
it's a nice thing.

389
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,962
We-- we hope you'll like it.

390
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:53,549
-Okay. Let me show
you some shit.
-CONNOR: Okay.

391
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,804
So, I consulted with
Gladwell and Harari,

392
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,974
and Lovelock and Popcorn,
and this in here,

393
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,517
it's, uh, it's pretty technical,

394
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,352
but this is the best
we could come up with

395
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,396
on the likely directions
of society,

396
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,481
so a little dry, but...

397
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,525
accurate, I would say.

398
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,776
-Accurate.
-CONNOR: President.

399
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,782
ROMAN: Hmm. Not a bad way to go.

400
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,827
Also, we got people in here
picturing me jerking off,

401
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,120
so who's the real winner?

402
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,997
Oh, man.

403
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,544
What if McCartney tweets this?

404
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,715
This is not-- I mean,
jokes are all very well and...

405
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,675
Come on, man,
I'm breaking through.

406
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,011
Ken, I'm not sure that you're
aware, but Conn is polling

407
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,306
-very close to one percent so...
-ROMAN: One percent?

408
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,599
-KENDALL: Really?
-Congrats.

409
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,975
That's four million people,

410
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,102
and it's enough
to sway the race.

411
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,855
And I am interested to see
who comes crawling first,

412
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,815
Merkel, begging for me
to save democracy

413
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,526

from the trees.

Yes, I'm-- I'm--
I'm a walking rainbow band.

-Oh, hey.

-Okay.

not letting us in.

-You done downstairs?
-Yeah. We are done.

step inside

-Okay.

-ROMAN: What?
-That's not possible.

508
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,461
Okay. Why?

509
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,546
(CLICKS TONGUE) Yeah, well,
because the thing is,

the treehouse is cool
and you're not cool.

511
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,302
Oh, wow, yes. The coolest

Let's go over here.

Just one second.

00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,523
Sorry, but, like,
so joking aside...

517
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,733
Great jokes.

518
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,069
There is actually
a real issue here...

519
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,528
-Okay.
-...and I need to be discreet

520
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,572
because there's a lot
of celebrities around

521
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,533
and if you guys were
in the treehouse, it kinda...

522
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,579
kinda wouldn't feel like
the treehouse, you know?

not gonna let us in?

00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,386
Or are you just
gonna bullshit us a little bit

00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,471
-before you let us in?
-To see Matsson?

a deal here.

-Really top rank.

What's the difference? I wanna
talk to him. So what?

539
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,319
Yeah. And you know what happens
if we do talk to him?

540
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,946

and nothing.

with it. It's musical chairs.

to me. What-- when?

give it to you, but...

-Fine. Okay.
No, I'll-- I'll find it.
-Yeah.

00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,842
I'm gonna find it
because it'll be logged.

What did it--
what did it look like?

653
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,930
Um, like-- like a present.

It had rabbit wrapping paper.

00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,182
but, um, there-- there's
another shape to this.

823
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,644
How about you never ever
have to speak to him?

824
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,524
I mean, you work out of,
uh, Austin, London, Stockholm,
Geneva, whatever.

825
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,818
Totally separate
corporate identities,

826
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,529
-and StarGo we burn, obviously.
-Yes.

827
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,989
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

828
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,366
-Like burn the codes
and fucking...
-(LAUGHS)

829
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,744
-...acid bath those servers!
-Fucking we can do that.

830
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,203
We can do that together.
Let's do it.

831
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,372
-Yeah.
-Absolutely. I mean,
GoJo full bore.

832
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,458
I mean, our library,
our firepower,

833
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,001
our relationships for content.

834
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,086
And like good shit,
you know what I mean?

835
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,506
Like not fucking gay moms
and wheelchair kids bullshit,

836
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,676
like popular actual good shit.

837
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,803
And on the occasion that
you need to send up

838
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,014
a fucking smoke signal
from Geneva,

839
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,724
then that goes through me.

840
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,642
You won't ever, ever
have to deal with him.

841
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,936
-All right.
-Or see him, or talk to him,
or hear-- nothing.

842
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,900
And you know that StarGo truly,
truly is a piece of shit.

843
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,486
It's a piece of shit. I know.

844
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,990
I like to open it just to see
how long it takes
for the landing page to load.

845
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,576
It is a piece of shit.
Hey, why don't we, um...

846
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,290
Why don't we just, like,
take a big old piss on our app?

847
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:38,959
I'm going to open up the app
on my phone,

848
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,420
and we can stream some piss
on our little
streaming platform.

849
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,506
-How's that sound?
-Fuck yeah.

850
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,633
-Nineteen, twenty...
-(CHUCKLES)

851
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,969
-...twenty-one, twenty-two.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

852
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:53,224
So, I can't piss near
other men due to...

853
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,142
we don't know what reason,
but please. (CLICKS TONGUE)

854
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,645
-Go ahead.
-Don't mind if I do.

855
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,605
Yeah. Enjoy.

856
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:04,443
(GROANS, LAUGHS)

857
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,946
So, I know GoJo is your baby,

858
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,740
and we do not wanna interfere
with that at all.

859
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,742
-You're the genius.
-Damn right I am.

860
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,203
Yep, so bearing that in mind,

861
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,288
would you consider
meeting with my dad?

862
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,917
Yeah.

863
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,504
And you'd be interested
in selling to us maybe?

864
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:28,300
Yeah, well, if all this is true,
then... yeah.

865
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,970
-How's Monday?
-Monday is great.

866
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,972
And if I were to shake your hand
right now, could I go

867
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,516
tell my dad that I basically
just bought GoJo for him?

868
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,101
(CHUCKLES) No.

869
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,186
But you can tell him
I'm in the conversation.

870
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,356
-Fucking A, I'll take it.
-Okay. Take this.

871
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,816
(CHUCKLES) Will do.

872
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:44,984
-Are we amazing?
-(CHUCKLES)

873
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,735
I think I might be the best
businessman in America.

874
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,823
Hey, check this out.
Still fucking loading.

875
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,200
-You piece of shit.
-Shit.

876
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,494
-ROMAN: Fuck you! (SPITS)
-(LUKAS LAUGHS)

877
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,663
Okay. (SIGHS) If you wanna
put on the harness,

878
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,875
you can tuxedo up,
step up onto the footrest.

879
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,543
Then we'll strap you in.

880
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,297
You'll have 30 seconds,
and the rig will fly you up

881
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,548
and into position.

882
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,259
You'll have a three, two, one,

883
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,303
and you'll see
the green light, okay?

884
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,430
That's the countdown
to the intro.

885
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,349
You ready?
You ready to crucify Billy Joel?

886
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,393
Yeah, yeah.

887
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:22,062
(CHUCKLES) I'm just kidding.
You're gonna be great.

888
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,566
Remember the thing he said
about the rig spiraling,

889
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,904
so just, like, keep still, yeah?
That sounded serious.

890
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,572
Okay. Harness, then mic.

891
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,035
Ready to rock?
You wanna get changed?

892
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,330
Yeah, you know what? Uh...

893
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,666
I don't think I'm gonna do this.

894
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,710
You don't wanna do it?

895
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:49,256
No, it's-- it's-- (SCOFFS)
It's bullshit. No.

896
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,968
Because you did say
if you don't lean right in,
it could come across dumb.

897
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,263
And your speech
kind of tees it up
with a kind of ironic,

898
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,557
"This is the culmination
of my life's journey,

899
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,936
-to be crucified to save
you morons, and..."
-I'm not doing it. It's-- it's--

900
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:05,856
it's like 15 layers
overdetermined master's degree
fucking hokum.

901
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,567
Let's just-- let's just pull it.
I mean, what-- what is it?

902
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,737
It's dressed in a tuxedo,
nailed to a cross,

903
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,656
singing "Honesty" by Billy Joel?

904
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,241
It doesn't make
any fucking sense.

905
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,952
Uh, what about the Tiny Wu-Tang?

906
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,372
(CLICKS TONGUE) Ah, fuck. Uh...

907
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,459
I don't know. I don't--
You know what? I don't think so.

908
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,920
No? Okay.

909
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,673
Tell 'em they've got it
all ahead of them. Yeah.

910
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,304

00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:37,740
jetpack for him to leave through
the retractable ceiling

934
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,284

Ye-- Yeah, um...

940
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:03,474
It's stupid, but earlier, um,

941
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,267
before I heard you were gonna

942
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,227
orchestrate
a smear campaign against me,

943
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,146
I-- I was actually gonna ask you

944
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,357
if you wanted to
grab a drink sometime.

945
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,859
Oh, okay.

946
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:17,404
Yeah, but then, um, Kendall,

947
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,282
you know, Ken-- Kendall,
he said, um...

948
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,284
COMFRY: He said what?

949
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:27,706
He just said maybe not.
Clean lines. Church and State.

950
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,833
Wrong time, wrong place. But--

951
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,169
but maybe...

952
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,631
when-- when you're
not working for him anymore

953
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,674
and trying to destroy
my reputation

954
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,718
-and, and such--
-You know, I've spent a week

955
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,346
researching where to get
lunchboxes from the '80s

956
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,390
to serve canapes from?

957
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,100
Like the one he used
to take to school.

958
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,394
And then he decided that
he didn't want lunchboxes,

959
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,271
and so now I have
all these He-Man lunchboxes
in my apartment,

960
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,023
and I have to resell them
on eBay,

961
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,900
and his office wants receipts.

962
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,281
So if you wanna ask me out,
then ask me out.

963
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,369
-Do you wanna go out sometime?
-Yes.

964
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:06,995
Great.

965
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:12,584

she's really dancing there.

a moment, please?

apparently, so I gotta find it.

if we don't look for it.

00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,081
Would you like my gift?

984
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:39,963
Yeah. Yes, I would.
Yes, I would love that.

00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,812
-NAOMI: It's a watch.
-Okay. Wow. Yeah. Thanks.

986
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,315
-Thanks, Nay.
-I'm, like, really bad
at presents. (LAUGHS)

987
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,942
-It-- I like it, all right.
-Just-- just give it back.

988
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,735
-No, I like it. I like it.
-No, it's fine. It's fine.

989
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,654
Thanks, Nay. Is it, uh--

990
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,365
Can I see?
Is it-- is it-- is it, um...

991
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,826
-inscribed, or...
-No, it's just a stupid watch.

992
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,661
Okay? I'll get you
something else.

993
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,749
Do you, uh... want a blow job?

994
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,793
Hah. No, it's just...

995
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,799
I don't wanna be a dick,
but I-- I have a watch,

996
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,342
you know, I have my watch.

997
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,802
It's a shitty gift, okay?

998
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,720
-I'm... bad.
-No, Nay, listen.

999
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,476
Yeah, I'm just trying to get
inside your head and figure out

1000
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,187
why you would give me this gift.

1001
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,526
Yeah, it's fine.

1002
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,071

okay? Look...

-Hey, stop.

1006
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:09,469

Stop, stop, stop.

1014
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,551
Let's go home.

1015
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,763
Are you okay?

1016
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,223
Yes, I'm okay, Greg. Why do you
keep asking if I'm okay?

1017
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,268
Well, just-- I haven't seen
you smile in, like six hours.

1018
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,354
You don't have to smile

-Ooh!

1024
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,242
-Me?
-Yeah.

1025
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:18,163
(CHUCKLES) Well, uh,
actually, because I, uh,

00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,129
Yes, I am amazing. Amazing.

1029
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,465
I mean, it's possible
she's only going out with me

1030
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:31,218

rancor or pique.

you're full of grace.

That's a weird thing to say.

-He being sarcastic?
-No, I think it's...

Full of fucking what? What?

He's just--
You're doing the job, right?

1038
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,612
And he's had a little cocaine
tonight, so I think he's...

1039
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,698
Dude, don't say that.
Don't say that.

I'm a public figure who could
one day run for high office

Well, yeah, it's just...

00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,799
I don't know. I-- I'm excited
about my date. I like her.

I feel happy, I guess.
It's not a finite pie,

But it's supposed to be me
that's happy, and it's you.

1053
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,942
How did that happen? Huh?

1054
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,403
I took the wrong drugs
in the wrong order,

1055
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,571
and I can't get happy.

1056
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,323
Well, can't you just
be happy you're free?

1057

No, 'cause you've ruined it.
