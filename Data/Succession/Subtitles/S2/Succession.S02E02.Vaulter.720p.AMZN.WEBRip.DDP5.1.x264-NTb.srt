1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,505
I'm not letting you Neanderthals
in to rape my company.

2
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,189
This is a deal so fucking
good, you have to take it,

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,510
or we'll see you in court.

4
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:15,426
We need to discuss
this bear hug: stick or settle?

5
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:16,624
I think you should fight.

6
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,418
- You're the one who built it all.
- Oh, that was adorable.

7
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,953
You're always looking
out for Pops, aren't you?

8
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,470
I'd like to formally ask you to come in

9
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,197
to be the next chief
executive of this company.

10
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:30,255
You're the one.

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,679
For now we need to keep this between us,

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,258
- everything about Tom, Gil.
- Of course.

13
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:36,983
What did he say? Where am I going?

14
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:38,809
What have you fucking
landed me? Is it huge?

15
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,102
Chair of global broadcast news.

16
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:42,138
ATN, baby.

17
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:45,186
Kendall and Roman will act as
co-chief operating officers.

18
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:46,784
Did you just say co-chief?

19
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:48,083
No, he's coming back?

20
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,709
Look what the cat dragged in.

21
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,303
He wanted me to tell you
you're going to bleed cash,

22
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:54,436
he's going to bleed cash,

23
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:57,179
and maybe you'll kill him,
but if you don't, he aims to kill you.

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,224
We're going to be the number one

25
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,794
media conglomerate in the world.

26
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,029
Hear, hear.

27
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,790
Can we get in? What's going on?

28
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:19,686
Let's go.

29
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:22,111
Let's see if he's still awake.

30
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:23,944
Is that him?

31
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,762
Okay. Can we yell,

32
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:29,362
"Wake up, Snow Joe!"

33
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:34,868
Wake up, Snow Joe!

34
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,138
There he is.

35
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,841
What's poppin', cum-dump?

36
00:01:40,842 --> 00:01:43,644
Yeah, just enjoying my
daughter's birthday, so...

37
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,145
Daddy, uh, we've tried everything.

38
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,448
Can they make the wagon train go faster?

39
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:48,482
Let's... Let's ask, yeah?

40
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,618
Can the wagon train go any faster?

41
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,486
Uh, up to a point.

42
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,422
Yeah, great. Let's take it
up to that point. Thanks.

43
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,622
Thanks, Daddy.

44
00:01:58,626 --> 00:01:59,927
The signage is for shit.

45
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:02,229
You know, still, some
other sucker's problem now.

46
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,597
Three months ago, I was at a
meeting about how to stop kids

47
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:07,401
giving each other handy jobs
on the runaway ghost train.

48
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:09,036
And now, I'm about to start managing

49
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:11,671
a billion-dollar news
budget, so... It's all good.

50
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:13,106
I gave my first hand
job on the ghost train.

51
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:15,542
I have a shitty
roommate right now, so I'm...

52
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:16,743
trying to move on from that.

53
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:18,912
My friend has an open
room in her apartment.

54
00:02:18,913 --> 00:02:20,414
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I mean,

55
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:22,849
she has an issue with spores from mold,

56
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,019
but I don't know. I don't know
how your lungs are with spores.

57
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,720
You know, I did see one place,

58
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,489
uh, 600 square feet.

59
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,824
But it was out in Staten Island.

60
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:31,958
- What?
- I dunno if...

61
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,146
Cousin Greg is moving to Staten Island?

62
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:35,205
No, no. I dunno.

63
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,523
Oh my God, did you hear this?

64
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,779
I'm just looking at a place out there.

65
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,203
Greg is getting the ferry to work?

66
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:40,700
Check out Bryan Ferry.

67
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:41,935
Dude, why stop at the ferry?

68
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:43,837
Just come in from
Cleveland on the Greyhound.

69
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:46,238
Have you considered a hotel?

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,441
Oh, wh... As, like, nightly, or... ?

71
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:51,444
Logan's requested your
presence in meeting room 4.

72
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:53,379
- Which?
- Both of you.

73
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,615
Oh. That'll be fun.

74
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,949
Beavis and Crackhead.

75
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:04,389
Um, Logan also asked
for you to join, too.

76
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,057
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:07,459
Oh. Okay.

78
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,961
- You wanna take this?
- No.

79
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:12,531
Off they all go again,
marching off to Daddy.

80
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:15,366
Like Russians joining
the Brusilov Offensive.

81
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,895
World War I.

82
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

83
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:27,112
My focus is bringing Waystar Royco

84
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:29,280
to its full earning potential.

85
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:32,183
- So, uh, Waystar refused to play ball?
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:33,485
I'm assuming they waved

87
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:34,919
a poison pill in your face

88
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,855
and now you're launching a proxy battle

89
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,357
to replace the board.

90
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:41,859
This guy, fuckin' dildo
dipped in beard trimmings.

91
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,428
He's fuckin' us on TV.

92
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:46,031
And of course Pierce put him on.

93
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:47,832
Yes, we're launching into a proxy battle

94
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,301
Self-righteous fuckin'
butter-wouldn't-melt,

95
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:52,937
disingenuous Pulitzer pricks.

96
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:55,073
Is Logan Roy fit

97
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:57,900
to run a 21st-century
media organization?

98
00:03:57,901 --> 00:04:00,193
You recognize any of this, son?

99
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:01,885
It's from the playbook, Dad.

100
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:04,112
Oh, yes, of course, the playbook.

101
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,370
Sure.

102
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:06,895
Let me just make it very clear.

103
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:09,687
Kendall Roy is no longer relevant.

104
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:11,355
Now, with regards to Sandy Furness...

105
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:12,389
So...

106
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,583
We keep our counsel. Dismissive.

107
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:16,375
Just lay it all out
in our proxy statement.

108
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:18,801
A hurried public response
makes us look rattled.

109
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:21,832
So let Stewy sway all
the shareholders first

110
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,035
while Dad sits there
with his thumb up his ass?

111
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:25,135
That's a great plan.

112
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:27,905
- Hey, Shiv.
- Respectfully, we just take a beat.

113
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:29,740
Let me, uh, put a solid pack together.

114
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,308
We fire back when we have the ammo.

115
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,544
By which point all the shooting's over.

116
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:36,180
No, get out now with a salty re-frame.

117
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:38,749
This is your standard-issue
basic-bitch corporate raider

118
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,718
versus a fuckin'
legendary force of nature,

119
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:43,019
Hurricane Logan.

120
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,089
He had a fastball once, but...

121
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,790
Now. Today.

122
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,859
Karolina runs the words past Shiv.

123
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,919
Yeah, Vaulter.

124
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,877
- Yeah. Okay.
- Vaulter. He paid too big...

125
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:54,331
- Right.
- Huge disappoi...

126
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:55,623
It's a huge disappointment.

127
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:57,401
Do you think they suckered us?

128
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:58,802
- Who, Vaulter?
- Uh-huh.

129
00:04:58,803 --> 00:05:01,004
No, we went deep on that. We... We...

130
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:02,172
kicked the tires good.

131
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:03,773
I think we got chiseled.

132
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:05,909
Revenue projections down and down.

133
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,043
I think we got screwed.

134
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:10,114
Yeah, me too. Massive
fuck-up, Ken. Huge.

135
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:11,481
Unforgivable.

136
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:14,083
Right, I want the response out today.

137
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:15,985
I need Vaulter fixed.

138
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:17,077
All right?

139
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:19,988
So I have something to say in
my fucking investor meetings.

140
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,325
- Go.
- Okay. Me?

141
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:24,494
Both of you. One who fixes it...

142
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:25,661
gets a cookie.

143
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:26,887
You got it. Sure thing, Dad.

144
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:30,181
I... I just wanted to
say thank you for, um...

145
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:32,040
closing down the park for us.

146
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,498
Sophie...

147
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,658
she's having a great birthday.
She got to meet Snow Joe and...

148
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,724
So thank you.

149
00:05:38,475 --> 00:05:40,276
Look at you, broken robot.

150
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:41,976
Can't even hug your own kids.

151
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:46,347
Yeah, I saw that, you freak.

152

Pinkie.

153
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:50,785
Happy?

154
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:52,954
Yeah. Smart.

155
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:54,988
Uh, let me know if you need anything.

I think I've contextualized it...

- It's not really a thing.
- No, no, no, sure.

00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,405
- Right. Yeah.
- Because... Because...

179
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,408
Big picture: our plan is right on track.

180
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,042
- You know?
- Uh-huh.

181
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:34,612
And you've... you've
seen Gil's numbers, right?

182
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,548
And... And as of today,
I'm right in at ATN.

183
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,948
You know, belly of the beast.

184
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,685
So...

185
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:44,622
- Hey.
- Yeah?

186
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:46,757
You wanna bang? Right now?

187
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,158
Cheeky little breakfast bang.

188
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,694
- Oh... I'm...
- Wanna?

189
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,763
I'm just such in a
different mental place...

190
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,298
- Okay.
- ... than you right now.

191
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,733
No, sure.

192
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:58,235
I just feel so incredibly potent.

193
00:08:58,236 --> 00:08:59,770
- Mm.
- You know?

194
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:01,305
I think it's the new place.

195
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:02,739
- Yeah.
- You know?

196
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,242
- I feel God-like and horny.
- Oof!

197
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:07,244
Everybody looks, like,
two feet tall to me.

198
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,780
Well, you know what? Maybe...

199
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:12,716
Maybe we should split
from the thing early

200
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:15,384
tonight and, you know, we can...

201
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:18,588
- talk, and...
- Mm-hmm.

202
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,023
- ... everything.
- Okay!

203
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:22,226
Okay! My fave. Strategy and a fuck.

204
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:25,495
- Okay, bye.
- Have a good one.

205
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:26,529
Bye, honey.

206
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:33,170
So cool. You know they have
their own beehive upstairs?

207
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:35,537
What is that? Is that, like,
the fucking business model?

208
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:38,040
Conflict porn and hipster honey.

209
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,074
Ugh.

210
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:40,877
Oh, shh.

211
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:43,112
The pretend journalists
are pretend working.

212
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:44,881
All right, Rome, just cool it.

213
00:09:44,882 --> 00:09:47,016
Let's move nice and slow here. Yeah?

214
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:49,252
- Mm-hmm.
- Just keep it small and general.

215
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:50,477
We don't wanna spook him.

216
00:09:50,478 --> 00:09:52,502
Yeah, okay. You
got it. You are in charge.

217
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:54,428
I follow your lead, fucker.

218
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,989
Larry Yee, King of New York!

219
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,414
What the fuck?

220
00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:00,841
Thanks for making space, man.
I know it was last minute.

221
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:03,868
Ah, dude. Anytime.

222
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,959
Hey, Lawrence.

223
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,536
I heard you were drying
out in a Schloss,

224
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:09,670
doing shitty yoga with hausfrau?

225
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:11,306
Right. right.

226
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:12,498
Nope.

227
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:15,710
He is back. He is back,
like a pedo on parole.

228
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:17,745
Yeah, man, we're
just here for a catch-up.

229
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:20,949
You know? Super casual, feet
on the table, whatever the fuck.

230
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,483
Just, uh, just help you out.

231
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:23,985
O... Obviously, I'm always pleased

232
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:25,020
to get your insights,

233
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:27,121
but, like, who am I talking to?

234
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:29,090
Co...

235
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:30,091
COOs.

236
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:31,259
Who's in charge here?

237
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,329
My brother and I have
a joint responsibility.

238
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,655
You know, we're sharing duties,

239
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:38,882
but we're on the same page
operationally. Right, Rome?

240
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:41,141
I don't know what the
fuck he's talking about.

241
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,370
There's just, uh,

242
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:45,807
a lot of, uh, crackle
in the air right now.

243
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:48,142
External pressures
with the proxy battle,

244
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:49,276
- that whole...
- Yeah.

245
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:51,946
So you're defusing the bomb you planted.

246
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:57,217
Yes, precisely. See,
he gets it. He sees.

247
00:10:57,218 --> 00:11:00,321
We're just here for a
routine health check.

248
00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:01,422
That's all this is.

249
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:02,581
Where's this coming from?

250
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:04,340
- It's coming from us.
- It's coming from Dad.

251
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:05,898
No. What, why are we
dancing around this?

252
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,699
It's coming from Dad.
Dad's worried about you.

253
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:09,189
Okay.

254
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,747
I mean, come on, you know how he is.

255
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:12,903
He doesn't get it. He still has
a plant out in the Philippines

256
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:14,836
manufacturing Xerox machines.

257
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:16,670
But he's fucking shrewd.

258
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,872
And, right now...

259
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:21,240
right now, his giant cyclops eye

260
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:23,710
is looking in this direction,
and he's feeling like

261
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:26,379
maybe he bought a
giant pile of bullshit.

262
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,814
So now here I am

263
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:30,450
to enquire in the
politest terms possible

264
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,486
what the fuck is going on.

265
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:34,354
Dad thinks maybe you fucked him.

266
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:37,591
Our numbers were solid
when you bought us,

267
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:38,825
and they're solid now.

268
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:40,460
Dude, really, don't take it personally.

269
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:41,808
Dad thinks everyone's fucking him.

270
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,363
I know you're on the level.

271
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:44,755
Help me make him see that.

272
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:45,780
What do you need?

273
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:48,474
I need metrics, I need KPIs,

274
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,769
and, uh, I need an office.

275
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,238
Me too, I need an office as well.

276
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:55,273
Separate from his. Nicer.

277
00:11:55,274 --> 00:11:58,110
It's on, me versus the Peach.

278
00:11:58,111 --> 00:11:59,378
Okay, I'm gonna s...

279
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:01,380
I'm gonna swing the old meat mallet.

280
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:03,749
I'm gonna sit on her
right out of the box.

281
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,150
Okay, so I could be calling

282
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:06,952
for a little bit of
the old punch-bagging,

283
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:07,987
okay, buddy?

284
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,489
- Uh-huh.
- Ready to play the bag?

285
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,657
- Y... Yeah, yeah. Give it to me.
- Okay.

286
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
What?

287
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:17,562
What is it, Greg?

288
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:21,500
Being in at ATN, you
know, it's kinda like

289
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:23,669
the one thing I didn't wanna do.

290
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,070
Oh, okay. So, what...

291
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:26,638
Should I have left you at Parks to sink?

292
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,705
I mean, it's...

293
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,541
it's ATN, man. It's the fuckin' news.

294
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,376
- I know.
- It's Logan's G-spot.

295
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,045
I can finger-bang him all night long.

296
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:35,380
I'm a direct direct report. What?

297
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,680
Sure, just...

298
00:12:38,484 --> 00:12:39,550
ATN?

299
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,754
It's... It's like...

300
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:45,590
- kind of against my principles.
- Your principles?

301
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:48,193
Greg, don't be an asshole.
You don't have principles.

302
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:50,895
Dude, ATN is a very toxic
element in the culture.

303
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:54,433
Oh, seriously? Okay, name me
one principle that you have.

304
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:56,468
I don't know, like, I'm against racism.

305
00:12:56,469 --> 00:13:00,195
Bullshit. I'm against racism.
Everybody's against racism.

306
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,205
What else?

307
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,240
- Like, don't lie.
- Fuck off.

308
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,776
- Like, if you're the news, you...
- Fuck off!

309
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:06,469
- That's your principle?
- Yeah, dude.

310
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,581
Greg, this is not fucking
Charles Dickens world, okay?

311
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:12,349
You don't go around
talking about principles.

312
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,985
We're all trying to do the right thing,

313
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:15,086
of course we are.

314
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,887
But come on, man!

315
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:19,723
Man the fuck up!

316
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:23,494
Okay, I am manned, man.

317
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:24,829
Here comes Cyd.

318
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,598
Hey, Cyd! The Peach!

319
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,032
The legend!

320
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:29,291
Oh, Tom!

321
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:30,301
- Tom!
- Hey!

322
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:31,936
It's great to have you aboard.

323
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,404
I know that this is gonna be

324
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:35,839
a really productive collaboration.

325
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,207
I just hope

326
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,843
that there's no... weirdness

327
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:42,079
with our fuzzy boundaries, right?

328
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,514
Are you kidding? If you...
If you wanna go fast,

329
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:47,851
go alone. If you wanna
go far, go together.

330
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:49,261
- Right?
- Exactly.

331
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,301
Yeah.

332
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:51,927
- Come meet the team.
- Amazing!

333
00:13:51,928 --> 00:13:53,352
You wanna lead in there?

334
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,278
Oh, fuck no.

335
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,171
- You lead, Tommy.
- Okay.

336
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:58,997
You mind if I big-ball the first one?

337
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:01,264
Do it! Your funeral, buddy.

338
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:03,100
Thank you, thank you.

339
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:05,636
So did he actually even see my draft?

340
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,694
Uh... no.

341
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:08,786
In the end, I just thought
the draft Kelly and I did

342
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:11,146
had more, uh, goodness.

343
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:12,204
As in... ?

344
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:13,796
As in it had the quality of being good

345
00:14:13,797 --> 00:14:15,411
rather than the
attributes of being shitty.

346
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:18,381
Um, just also re Kelly, little sidebar.

347
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,082
Can you not tell people about us?

348
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,351
Oh, but there is no us.

349
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:23,386
Right. but there was an
us, and the problem is,

350
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:24,654
my wife doesn't know about it.

351
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,856
Oh, but my husband
absolutely does know about it,

352
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:29,292
so I guess that's,
what, it's your problem?

353
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:30,593
We had the affair.

354
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:31,994
We didn't have the conversation

355
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:33,630
about telling people we had the affair.

356
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:35,365
I'm sorry, Nate, did you
want a conference call

357
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:37,666
to discuss how to tell
your wife we fucked?

358
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,170
Thank you, everyone.

359
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,438
Great event. Great event.

360
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:46,107
Thank you, everyone, so much.

361
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:47,276
And the polling!

362
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,944
My God! I mean, nobody's
getting carried away,

363
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:51,713
just one set of numbers,

364
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:54,849
one pretty big set of numbers. Right?

365
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,454
Right, so thank you. And
testament to your faith.

366
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:00,822
Thank you. Please,

367
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:03,091
indulge yourselves in some, uh,

368
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:05,360
gluten and melted cheese. Why not?

369
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:06,995
Thank you, thank you.

370
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:08,730
Mm.

371
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:10,332
Hey, uh, how was the call?

372
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,267
Great. They're eating
out of my ass crack.

373
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:16,404
Offered me use of the
fucking jet on the weekend.

374
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:18,306
Uh, yeah, I mean, the legals are wonky

375
00:15:18,307 --> 00:15:21,075
and the optics are shitty, but go ahead.

376
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:23,912
Look.

377
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:26,414
You don't look a gift
Boeing in the teeth.

378
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:27,982
Right? Right?

379
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:29,583
- No.
- I'll be so much fresher.

380
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,387
Excuse us for a second. I just wanna...

381
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:34,956
Ma'am, listen.

382
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,825
Long road to travel and all of that,

383
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:39,660
but the compass points
to Pennsylvania Avenue.

384
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,795
I have to start thinking
about appointments.

385
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:45,265
I'm thinking about Chief of Staff.

386
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:48,936
Uh... Oh, wow.

387
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:50,204
Yeah.

388
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:53,607
I mean, can you imagine the look of fear

389
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:56,210
in their eyes when they
see you coming at them?

390
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,645
Those corpulent old white fucks.

391
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:00,147
Huh?

392
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:01,781
How's that for a carrot?

393
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:03,315
Hm?

394
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:07,254
So that's where we shape the debate.

395
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:09,656
Ooh, cool shit.

396
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:12,259
And I love the way the
debate keeps on getting shaped

397
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,361
like a burning cross.

398
00:16:14,362 --> 00:16:16,263
You don't share our news values.

399
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,464
Oh, I'm kidding.

400
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:19,532
I'm kidding. I get it.
I'm from the Midwest.

401
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:22,169
You know, my mom's friend,
Deb, weighs, like, 300 pounds,

402
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,337
and she's pissed as fuck
about practically everything,

403
00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:26,339
so, you know, trust me,

404
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,907
I'm down. I get it.

405
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:31,043
Besides, what Logan
wants, Logan gets, right?

406
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:33,647
Logan doesn't set our news agenda.

407
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:36,483
Oh. No, of course he doesn't.

408
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:38,117
I know, it's so weird, huh?

409
00:16:38,118 --> 00:16:40,153
He happens to own a news company

410
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:42,555
and they say exactly what he thinks.

411
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,291
If Logan had to tell me

412
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,058
or any of my news editors

413
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:48,328
what to run or what the angle was,

414
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:51,264
we would be fucked.
That is not how it works.

415
00:16:51,265 --> 00:16:52,699
This isn't mind control.

416
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,234
We hire people who want to work here.

417
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:56,669
and we serve a demographic

418
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,871
of highly, highly intelligent viewers,

419
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:01,940
who are really tired

420
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,042
of being patronized elsewhere

421
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:06,812
by latte-sipping douchebags

422
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:08,546
with hundred-dollar haircuts.

423
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,551
You've got the cool job title,

424
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:13,819
you've got freedom of movement.

425
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,022
Why don't you take a
look somewhere more comfy?

426
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:18,056
Entertainment?

427
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:19,758
'Cause this is where the action is.

428
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,827
This is the profit center.

429
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:25,597
The median age of our audience is 68.

430
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:29,500
The ads are all adult
diapers and shit pills.

431
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:31,436
Our lead in the news demo has halved.

432
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:33,038
You know, maybe I can

433
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,506
lend a hand to take a
look at some of that.

434
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:36,908
You know,

435
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:39,711
he sends me one of you every four years.

436
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:42,314
- That train is never late.
- Interesting.

437
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:45,016
And tell me, these others that he sends,

438
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:46,851
were they his son-in-law too?

439
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:49,620
I'm curious.

440
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:53,091
Efficiencies, Cyd! I'm
here to trim the flab.

441
00:17:53,092 --> 00:17:54,993
Have you told Logan this?

442
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:57,028
I spy savings, Cyd.

443
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:58,897
Oh, good, Tom.

444
00:17:58,898 --> 00:18:00,198
That's very good.

445
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:02,999
Because I run a pretty tight ship.

446
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:04,635
So...

447
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:06,771
good luck to you.

448
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:10,140
I'm sure you've got
him very, very excited.

449
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:11,941
I hope you can deliver.

450
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:16,481
Well...

451
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:17,982
Thank you very much.

452
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,917
And, uh, fuck you.

453
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:22,119
And, uh, I'll catch up with you later.

454
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,121
Not on your dying day, baby.

455
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,027
Greg, I need you on the ground.

456
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:31,161
- Oh.
- Okay?

457
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:33,030
I need you to be my
representative on earth.

458
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,165
I want you to... I want you
to go on a mission for me

459
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,667
and body-shame ATN,

460
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:38,735
find the fat and point it out.

461
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:40,137
Yeah, like, how?

462
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:41,505
Like, find the excess, okay?

463
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:44,741
Find the extraneous Danish,
the surfeit of stationary,

464
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:47,744
the... the lazy cleaner,
the mail guy who walks slow.

465
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:49,746
Okay? Snuffle out waste, pig man.

466
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:51,748
Okay, I'll do the penthouse,
you do the basement.

467
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:53,582
- All right?
- Yeah, yeah, you got it.

468
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:56,419
Wait, uh, which are these?

469
00:18:57,956 --> 00:19:00,391
You know what? I'm not sure.

470
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:01,490
Let me go check.

471
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:06,562
Keep it coming. Fuckin'
drown him in paper.

472
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,570
Good night, Kendall.

473
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:14,670
Night, dude.

474
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,676
What's he doing?

475
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:21,076
I dunno. Reading?

476
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:24,815
Thanks, useless.

477
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:26,482
Drink your smoothie and shut up.

478
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:32,955
Actually drinking the smoothie...

479
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,901
I can give you 52 seconds.

480
00:19:44,902 --> 00:19:46,703
Well, I'm in at Vaulter.

481
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:47,803
Yeah, so?

482
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:49,905
Yeah, so, let's fucking game this out.

483
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:51,975
Roman, we are in a proxy war.

484
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:53,576
The plane has just been hijacked,

485
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:55,378
all the engines have
fallen into the sea,

486
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:56,912
and the pilot's hair is on fire.

487
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:58,614
Gerri, come on, I need something.

488
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,648
Kendall's doing shit.

489
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:01,684
Okay, how about this: you do shit.

490
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:02,918
What have you got?

491
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,787
One idea: pivot to video?

492
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,222
Yeah, they tried that already.

493
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:08,358
Can you just come over?
I want you in the room.

494
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,592
Can I come over?

495
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:11,394
Yeah. Could... Yeah...

496
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:12,395
Fuck you!

497
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:14,029
Fuck you.

498
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,908
Excuse me, folks, um,
could I maybe interest you all

499
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:28,977
in going for one of those fuckin'...

500
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,745
IPAs that looks like
run-off at the carwash?

501
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:33,814
Is he in the chair?

502
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:37,381
Hey, Dad?

503
00:20:41,257 --> 00:20:43,825
I need three independent
women. Know any?

504
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:44,859
Uh-huh.

505
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,261
The board?

506
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:48,387
Be great if one was in
a fucking wheelchair.

507
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:52,134
Black, white, green, pink.

508
00:20:52,135 --> 00:20:55,102
A Cambodian landmine
victim, if you know any.

509
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:57,171
Yeah, be the change you
wanna see in the world.

510
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,672
You're a real beacon of hope, Dad.

511
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:00,141
Mm.

512
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:01,841
What do you think about Pierce?

513
00:21:03,778 --> 00:21:06,313
Buying? PGM as a defense?

514
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:08,749
I... Honestly, I think that's
chasing the white whale.

515
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,917
Again.

516
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:11,585
It's never gonna work,
it's not a good fit.

517
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:12,819
Uh-huh.

518
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,755
Dad, I was wondering
whether we should...

519
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:16,190
talk.

520
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,891
You know, about...

521
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:19,493
It wasn't a dream, right?

522
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,595
Are you kidding? I'm excited!

523
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:23,897
So, let's talk.

524
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:25,666
Should you go, or shall I?

525
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,801
Uh, well, I have some ideas that I...

526
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:34,733
Siobhan? What a surprise. He never said.

527
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:36,076
- Hi.
- Hi.

528
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:37,444
Just a pop-in.

529
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:41,147
Pinkie was telling me how, um...

530
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:43,583
Connor's moved into a hotel in the city.

531
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:44,984
I saw.

532
00:21:44,985 --> 00:21:48,087
He sent out his email bulletin
with all the photographs.

533
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:51,392
He rents a room, he rents a girl.

534
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:55,928
Can you check if Richard's
turned off that fuckin' Alexa?

535
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:57,730
Not just off, unplugged.

536
00:21:57,731 --> 00:22:01,634
I've got enough spies after
me without Bezos in here too.

537
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:02,667
Okay?

538
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:04,569
Right.

539
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:23,229
So...

540
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:25,323
here's how I see it.

541
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,426
Come in.

542
00:22:27,427 --> 00:22:30,362
Six months with Gerri,
six months with Karl.

543
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:32,732
Hong Kong for, say, another 12.

544
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:36,201
Uh, Berlin, or London.

545
00:22:36,202 --> 00:22:39,004
Management training program for six.

546
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:43,407
Come back, spend 12 months alongside me.

547
00:22:43,408 --> 00:22:45,844
And when you're ready, I'll step aside.

548
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:47,979
Wow, Dad, that's a lot of months.

549
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,148
It's an appropriate amount of months.

550
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:52,483
Also, management training program?

551
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:53,918
Roman's COO.

552
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,586
You have a toddler with a hard-on

553
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:56,921
for chief operating officer,

554
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:59,190
and I'm going through a
management training program?

555
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:01,092
You're a young woman with no experience.

556
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:02,493
A woman. That's a minus.

557
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:04,763
Well, of course it's a fucking minus!

558
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:06,097
I didn't make the world!

559
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:07,231
You make a small part of it.

560
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:09,100
If that doesn't work for you, what does?

561
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:11,093
That's a fucking... That's
a three-year timeline.

562
00:23:11,094 --> 00:23:12,136
Okay.

563
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:13,937
So why don't you come in tomorrow

564
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:15,039
and spend the day with me?

565
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,874
Oh, Jesus Christ, Dad.

566
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,242
What?

567
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:20,511
I need time, I... I
haven't even told Tom yet.

568
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:22,079
- Tell him.
- And there's Gil.

569
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,415
I have a job, I can't
just come running to you.

570
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,084
What is it, Siobhan,
too slow or too fast?

571
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:28,919
Because I'm fucking confused.

572
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,888
Dad, I want this.

573
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:32,546
It's just about the process.

574
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:33,672
Okay.

575
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:34,858
Okay?

576
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:36,471
So... you wanna get into it?

577
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:37,509
Not now.

578
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,929
I'm busy. Proxy statement.

579
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,001
You didn't give me any warning.

580
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,399
- All right.
- I mean, you know,

581
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,699
tomorrow night could work?

582
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,933
- That... Yeah.
- Tomorrow?

583
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:46,002
Uh... Yeah, let me take a look.

584
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:47,837
Oh, is that no good for you?

585
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:49,706
I'm around.

586
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:51,708
- I'm excited.
- Mm-hmm.

587
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:52,942
Me too.

588
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:55,044
I'll get back to you tomorrow...

589
00:23:55,045 --> 00:23:57,346
- on the names for the board.
- Mm-hmm.

590
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:03,713
- Love you.
- I love you. Goodnight.

591
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:08,558
All right.

592
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,726
I haven't got all day.

593
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,932
Agenda is Vaulter.

594
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:18,701
We need a way forward
on the Vaulter problem

595
00:24:18,702 --> 00:24:21,470
ahead of investor
meetings in two days' time.

596
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:24,205
Do you want to present jointly or... ?

597
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:25,660
Ken?

598
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:27,019
Yeah, I'll take it.

599
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,512
Um, so, I've spent the last 36 hours

600
00:24:30,513 --> 00:24:33,081
on a deep dive into the
drivers of the business.

601
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:34,916
Headline is, it's a body pit.

602
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:37,219
Uh, they have mass of
data with no analytics.

603
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,488
There's no way of telling
what's a hand and what's a foot.

604
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,690
But it's still a killer business.

605
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:43,392
The platform, the brands.

606
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:46,295
Uh, ethos and culture are leading edge.

607
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:49,530
And, um, in my view, it's fixable.

608
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:50,966
It's funny how these fuck-ups

609
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,968
always make the bottom line look fatter.

610
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,303
All they need is adults in the room.

611
00:24:55,304 --> 00:24:57,572
Accounting team, analytics team,

612
00:24:57,573 --> 00:24:59,174
and, uh, investment.

613
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:01,542
We burn 50 million for a few years,

614
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,712
we... make it the best
thing in the world.

615
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,714
Oh, is that all?

616
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:09,449
Well, you always say
"Gotta burn to turn."

617
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:11,920
Romulus, what's your read?

618
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,388
You know, it's interesting, Dad,

619
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:15,623
because I hear everything
that he's saying,

620
00:25:15,624 --> 00:25:18,426
and it actually... It almost
sounds like a good pitch.

621
00:25:18,427 --> 00:25:20,796
But... I call bullshit.

622
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:22,930
I spent some time down there,
and I'm just not seeing it.

623
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:24,765
Now, I don't know exactly
what they're doing,

624
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:25,833
but they're fakes.

625
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,302
Fucking beehives, almond milk, and...

626
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:30,938
"Take another week on
that report, Matilda."

627
00:25:30,939 --> 00:25:32,539
It smells wrong,

628
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,940
and they're hiding shit.

629
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,642
Speaking of hiding shit,

630
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:37,444
I took a couple of their staffers out,

631
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,113
I got them shitfaced,

632
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:40,681
and apparently,

633
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:42,283
they're looking to unionize,

634
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:43,516
and fucking soon.

635
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:46,057
Oh, yeah?

636
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:47,883
Pay transparency,

637
00:25:47,884 --> 00:25:49,308
bargaining rights.

638
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:52,468
Just nasty, tangly shit.

639
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:54,194
And it's not a body pit,

640
00:25:54,195 --> 00:25:55,653
whatever the fuck a body pit is.

641
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,578
It's a fucking muesli pit,

642
00:25:57,579 --> 00:26:00,113
and doesn't fit with
our core, you know...

643
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,617
values.

644
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:04,304
So now I'm thinking we
just shutter the fucker.

645
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:06,172
Close it? That's chunky.

646
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:09,008
Come... I mean... He doesn't
know what he's talking about.

647
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:10,376
That's just insane.

648
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:12,745
The write-down on that would
be what? It's a bitter pill.

649
00:26:12,746 --> 00:26:14,914
Come on, I mean, i... i...
in the middle of a proxy fight

650
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:16,850
when we've got Stewy and
Sandy taking out full-page ads

651
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,585
in the Journal attacking
us for pissing capital up the wall?

652
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,754
It... It... I mean,
it makes us look weak.

653
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:23,289
No, it makes us look ruthless.

654
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,259
And actually, I do know what
I'm fucking talking about.

655
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,094
Dad, what the fuck are we doing?

656
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:30,230
Show me the bloat anywhere
else in this company.

657
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:31,855
Where is it? You show me.

658
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,113
Show me the waste

659
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:34,906
that we're letting these
fuckers get away with.

660
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:37,336
Fine, so we restructure
them and we grow them...

661
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:39,637
I think if we don't
shutter it, then we gut it.

662
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:41,339
We carve that shit like a pumpkin.

663
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:42,975
How?

664
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,409
You hive off the profit center,

665
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,710
you keep the domain name, the archive,

666
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:48,179
um...

667
00:26:49,215 --> 00:26:50,615
Gut level, Dad,

668
00:26:50,616 --> 00:26:53,718
this thing is not coming back.
They're fuckin' assholes.

669
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,785
Dad.

670
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,336
Vaulter can be our lodestar.

671
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:03,427
Th... This is... This
isn't the time to retreat.

672
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,401
Your brother's right. Gut it.

673
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Okay.

674
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,177
Roman,

675
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:23,079
I want you on the
proxy battle with Gerri.

676
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:25,049
Kendall,

677
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,618
you think you can gut Vaulter for me?

678
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:28,985
Or you need help?

679
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:33,190
I'll take care of it, Dad.

680
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:17,839
Uh, you know, when Willa told me

681
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,474
about moving to New York for her play,

682
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:21,435
I thought, "Ah, I don't
want to move to the city."

683
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:23,745
"I wanna stay on the ranch.

684
00:28:23,746 --> 00:28:25,147
Maybe I'll get me a new girlfriend."

685
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:26,814
I'm kidding.

686
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:29,484
No, I mean, it's true.

687
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:32,154
It was pretty hard to wheedle
the old man out of the dessert.

688
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:35,634
But, um, we're here now

689
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:38,793
in our, um, not-so-humble home...

690
00:28:38,794 --> 00:28:40,328
hotel. Um.

691
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:42,956
But, uh, friends, family, please,

692
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:44,858
you know, feel free to drop in anytime,

693
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:47,027
and, um, don't worry about all this,

694
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:50,230
'cause it's on our tab. So...

695
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:51,563
Okay. Great.

696
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:53,800
Cheers!

697
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,334
Okay.

698
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,504
Hey, Con, thank you so much

699
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:00,573
for taking care of the
sliders and all this shit.

700
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,642
Yeah, and the champagne.
It's very big of you.

701
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,777
And I love what you haven't
done with the place as well.

702
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:06,746
Yeah, well, you know we
got a really good deal.

703
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,281
And rehearsals are
right around the corner.

704
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:09,782
Plus, I needed a place in the city

705
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:11,284
'cause I'm gonna start ramping up soon.

706
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:13,719
So I needed campaign headquarters.

707
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,955
Wait.

708
00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:16,957
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

709
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,292
- Are you still doing that?
- Very funny. Yes.

710
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:20,793
I'm still applying for the job

711
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:22,429
of President of the United States.

712
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,863
Oh, good for you.

713
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:25,097
Yeah. Do you...

714
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,898
Do you think that that's
like a natural progression

715
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,800
from "never done nothing, never,"

716
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,469
to "most important job in the world?"

717
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,870
- Well...
- Like, could you maybe

718
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:34,173
get a little experience at,
like at a CVS, something, first?

719
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:36,741
Yeah, yeah, or just, like,
nickel hand jobs under a bridge.

720
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,622
- Start small.
- You guys have big plans for me.

721
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:41,013
Place is a time machine.

722
00:29:41,014 --> 00:29:44,149
It's like 45 minutes every
time they need file tape,

723
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,085
all the way to some warehouse in Queens.

724
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:47,119
Okay, so?

725
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,587
So, I don't know. I mean...

726
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:50,489
How come it isn't digitized?

727
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,158
The whole of ATN, it's
totally analog, Tom.

728
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,994
So I could fire people?

729
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:57,629
Correct? If we did
this? If we digitized?

730
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,131
I... I mean, you'd be removing, like,

731
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,500
two links from the production
chain of every show.

732
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:03,767
- But would it be...
- Okay, okay, okay.

733
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,037
But... but in terms of skulls,

734
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,506
how many skulls, do you think?

735
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,141
- That we can lose?
- Yeah.

736
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,910
I dunno. I... I guess, like, 30 or 50?

737
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,411
Fifty skulls?

738
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,749
I'm slavering, pig man!

739
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,442
Fifty skulls is a lot of skulls!

740
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,519
Yeah.

741
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,188
I know, it's goo... It's... tons.

742
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,189
Oh, look at this fuckin' prick.

743
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,560
Yikes, I almost feel sorry for him.

744
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,828
Oh yeah? Why?

745
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,630
Just emptied the contents of his scrotum

746
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,631
at Dad's feet.

747
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,900
We're gutting Vaulter.

748
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:37,467
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

749
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,302
Is that a good idea?

750
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,838
Fucking great idea.

751
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,373
It's Kendall's baby, and
now we're gonna burn it.

752
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,477
Hey, um... So, we we're thinking, uh...

753
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,112
me and, uh, Tabitha and I,

754
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:52,649
uh, that we'd like to have
you and Tom over for dinner.

755
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,285
Uh... sorry, what? Do you...

756
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,387
Roman Roy, did you just
invite us to dinner?

757
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,756
Oh, fuck you. All right, shut up.

758
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,958
Yes, I did. Metro poser bullshit.

759
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,359
Napkins and chitchat.

760
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,427
Ooh, race relations. Kale.

761
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:20,702
Hey.

762
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:21,795
Hey.

763
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,387
Do you reckon if I called room service

764
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:25,308
and asked them to poke
me in the eye, they would?

765
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:28,150
It's pretty unbearable in there.

766
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,653
Can I get a drag?

767
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,390
Yeah.

768
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,260
I hear Dad's got Vaulter in a crosshair.

769
00:31:41,164 --> 00:31:42,164
Roman?

770
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:45,968
He shouldn't be talking
to you about that.

771
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:48,504
Just seems like a bad move to me.

772
00:31:48,505 --> 00:31:50,871
I'm just saying, I always liked it.

773
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,041
Yeah, well.

774
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:56,811
Dad's right.

775
00:31:58,415 --> 00:31:59,814
Are you with him on this?

776
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:04,119
He sees everything, Shiv.

777
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:07,523
You have a hard time
finding a happy medium

778
00:32:07,524 --> 00:32:10,559
between worshipping him
and wanting to kill him.

779
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,626
Huh?

780
00:32:15,797 --> 00:32:17,432
- The Vaulter thing.
- Mm.

781
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:18,799
Gutting it.

782
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,535
What if it's the wrong thing?

783
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:22,036
I thought your dad agreed with you?

784
00:32:22,037 --> 00:32:24,839
Uh, yeah, he did. And
now they're doing it.

785
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,141
They're actually doing
the thing that I said.

786
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:29,144
Fuck.

787
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,946
Think maybe you just did your job.

788
00:32:31,947 --> 00:32:33,313
Shall we get some more champagne?

789
00:32:33,815 --> 00:32:35,517
I mean...

790
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:38,352
It could be right. It might
not be, but it could be.

791
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:40,920
Maybe I'm smart.

792
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:42,922
Sure.

793
00:32:43,725 --> 00:32:44,725
Maybe.

794
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:47,595
You did a thing.

795
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:48,728
Mazel tov.

796
00:32:49,374 --> 00:32:50,564
You know, I'm gonna...

797
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:52,700
I'm gonna schedule
some time with your dad,

798
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:54,401
and take him out for dinner
and wine him and dine him

799
00:32:54,402 --> 00:32:56,737
and make love to him
with my ideas, you know?

800
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:58,405
This could be huge, Shiv.

801
00:32:58,406 --> 00:33:00,440
Tom, I think...

802
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:02,042
I think we should talk.

803
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:04,979
Uh...

804
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,279
You wanna get out of here?

805
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,984
Okay.

806
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:13,054
Is this about ATN?

807
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:14,889
Hey, you... you want something?

808
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,490
I'll get you something.

809
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:23,363
Ooh, that's a biggie.

810
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:25,131
Is this about the arrangement?

811
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:26,766
Look, Tom, it's...

812
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,133
no, it's Waystar.

813
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:31,237
This is never gonna happen,

814
00:33:31,238 --> 00:33:33,707
and I don't even trust
him, and even if I did,

815
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,640
I'm not even sure that I would want it.

816
00:33:37,044 --> 00:33:38,376
But, uh...

817
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:42,815
he offered it to me.

818
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:45,551
To be next.

819
00:33:45,953 --> 00:33:46,985
Dad.

820
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,857
Oh.

821
00:33:50,858 --> 00:33:52,425
- Oh my...
- Mm.

822
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:54,560
Shiv... when?

823
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:56,328
Uh, the Hamptons.

824
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:58,730
The Hamptons?

825
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,368
Oh, my God, Shiv, that's...

826
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:04,503
That's like a week ago.

827
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:06,171
Congratulations! What the fuck!

828
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:08,040
I know!

829
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,343
I mean, I... I... I
don't know what to think.

830
00:34:10,344 --> 00:34:12,278
Holy shit! I mean,

831
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:14,312
this is... huge!

832
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:16,406
S...

833
00:34:16,407 --> 00:34:20,434
- So, I mean, do you...
- Want it? No!

834
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:22,722
And I don't even trust him, so I...

835
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:24,523
Because I thought that it was something

836
00:34:24,524 --> 00:34:26,259
that we wanted for me...

837
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,426
- We do.
- ... to have it?

838
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:28,594
- We do!
- That was... I mean,

839
00:34:28,595 --> 00:34:29,862
that was just the plan.

840
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:31,496
That's st... still the plan.

841
00:34:31,497 --> 00:34:33,999
Me is just a modification of the plan.

842
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,901
No, sure.

843
00:34:35,902 --> 00:34:37,803
It's q... quite a big modification.

844
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:39,404
But d... d... so, did...

845
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:40,639
d... did he...

846
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,841
We... Uh, paint the
picture for me. What'd he...

847
00:34:42,842 --> 00:34:45,244
He asked me, and I said yes.

848
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:47,112
But only as a play.

849
00:34:47,113 --> 00:34:48,580
Totally.

850
00:34:48,581 --> 00:34:50,749
So what was the play?

851
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,718
Well, he's asked before, obviously,

852
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,220
and this time was real...

853
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:58,958
so...

854
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:02,018
I thought I would be
deleveraging power if I said no.

855
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:03,585
Exactly. Yes.

856
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:08,667
Tom, this is 100 percent
not going to happen.

857
00:35:08,668 --> 00:35:11,436
But it's smart to say yes, right?

858
00:35:11,437 --> 00:35:13,104
I am so...

859
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:14,872
excited for you!

860
00:35:14,873 --> 00:35:16,508
- Thank you.
- For us!

861
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:18,576
I am.

862
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:22,846
And you know, it's okay for
you to say that you want it.

863
00:35:23,783 --> 00:35:25,016
I'd support you.

864
00:35:25,017 --> 00:35:26,618
Well, look, I mean...

865
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:29,220
Say I did want it,
w... and I... I don't,

866
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:30,955
you know, you...

867
00:35:30,956 --> 00:35:33,325
if I was CEO of Waystar, I mean...

868
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:36,829
I mean, you, honey, are
gonna be something huge.

869
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,921
Yeah.

870
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:39,246
Sure. Like what?

871
00:35:39,247 --> 00:35:40,537
I... I don't know.

872
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,587
But we'll figure it out.

873
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:44,035
Yeah, that's for later
on down... down the road.

874
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:45,916
- Whenever. Just whenever.
- Wow.

875
00:35:50,342 --> 00:35:52,276
I mean, it's hilarious, right?

876
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,510
Oh, yes!

877
00:35:53,511 --> 00:35:55,611
It's fucking funny!

878
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,318
Yeah...

879
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:02,153
- Hey, come here.
- Hey.

880
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:03,453
- Mm.
- Hey.

881
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:06,157
Oh. Oh, now?

882
00:36:06,158 --> 00:36:07,725
- Mm. Why not?
- Well, let me just...

883
00:36:07,726 --> 00:36:09,517
Hang on. Let me just
go and brush my teeth.

884
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:10,560
No.

885
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:12,094
- No, come here.
- Okay.

886
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,500
I... I hear your brother's
running for president.

887
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:19,302
Maybe we should get him here.

888
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,604
He seems like the... the serious one.

889
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:24,106
Right. Lawrence, we have a problem.

890
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:26,414
Okay?

891
00:36:26,415 --> 00:36:28,148
My dad wants to shut you down.

892
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,682
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

893
00:36:32,683 --> 00:36:34,885
But I don't want you
to worry about my dad.

894
00:36:34,886 --> 00:36:36,486
Okay? I can handle my dad.

895
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:37,687
The fuck you talking about?

896
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:39,222
I know what's going on here.

897
00:36:39,223 --> 00:36:41,958
Right? It's a... It's a...
It's a Potemkin village.

898
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,593
I mean, the engagement and bounce rate

899
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:45,661
have been inflated and
fucked around so much

900
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,296
they're impossible to verify.

901
00:36:47,297 --> 00:36:49,265
your share stats, the... the churn,

902
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:51,567
the SEO traffic KPIs are all bullshit.

903
00:36:51,568 --> 00:36:55,237
I mean, you suckered me
in, and, uh, I bought it.

904
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:58,107
We had a couple shitty traffic months...

905
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:00,267
Uh, Facebook changed their algorithm.

906
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:01,292
Uh-huh.

907
00:37:01,293 --> 00:37:02,669
- We got face-fucked, okay?
- All right.

908
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,994
We're turning the corner now.

909
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:04,995
Okay.

910
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:07,082
O... Okay.

911
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,317
What? Yeah, o... okay.
Is... Is that real?

912
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:12,854
- From Logan?
- Look, I can fix this.

913
00:37:13,757 --> 00:37:15,858
Okay? But no more obfuscation.

914
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,527
No more shitty data.

915
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:20,562
I need the full, fiber-optic,
clear-channel shit.

916
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:23,332
CT scan the whole
place, and we move fast.

917
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:24,699
Okay.

918
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,834
Do you like double-crossing your dad?

919
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:29,604
Oh, that's your favorite.

920
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:31,206
Isn't it?

921
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:35,810
I'm of the opinion he can be
persuaded he's making a mistake.

922
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,713
- Okay?
- Okay.

923
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:42,318
Oh yeah, w... Uh, one more thing.

924
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:46,388
I... I... I need everyone
to cool it on unionizing.

925
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,923
Okay, they're not gonna do that.

926
00:37:47,924 --> 00:37:50,159
Half of them are about
to sign union cards.

927
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,225
Let me speak to them.

928
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,396
Everyone here fucking hates you.

929
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,299
I think I can take it.

930
00:38:00,202 --> 00:38:02,170
Hey, everyone. Thanks for...

931
00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:04,573
Thanks for gathering.
This'll just be a minute.

932
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:06,441
Can you... Can you guys
hear me in the back?

933
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:08,041
Yeah?

934
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:09,643
Uh...

935
00:38:10,713 --> 00:38:11,713
Vaulter.

936
00:38:12,682 --> 00:38:15,750
Hey, um... Okay.

937
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,019
Look, some of you might
have noticed this already,

938
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,089
but, uh, just so you're
getting it direct from me,

939
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,659
uh, Waystar management has been
taking a look at the business

940
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,894
over the last week.

941
00:38:25,895 --> 00:38:28,195
But I just wanna say
this to you in person...

942
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:32,561
I believe Vaulter is the
future of this company.

943
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:33,653
Sure.

944
00:38:33,654 --> 00:38:36,203
I'm Se... I'm fuckin' s... dead serious.

945
00:38:36,204 --> 00:38:38,038
Just... You can't question my belief

946
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:40,608
in what you've all built here.

947
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,744
You know, in... in... in
what Lawrence has built.

948
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:45,445
But if we're gonna come through here,

949
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:47,381
we need to be light on our feet.

950
00:38:47,382 --> 00:38:49,316
That's why I personally think

951
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:52,419
it would be a mistake
for you to unionize.

952
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:54,922
Just... Just hear me out.

953
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:56,156
Okay, we will get you

954
00:38:56,157 --> 00:38:58,893
a really punchy independent
arbitration panel,

955
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:00,160
we'll get you a pay bump.

956
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:02,294
I know a lot of you are
flirting with the guild,

957
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:04,330
and I'm just asking you to consider

958
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:05,765
putting that on ice.

959
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:08,133
And let's try and
figure this out inside.

960
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:10,469
We keep it in the...

961
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,007
fuckin' super cheesy,
but in the Waystar family.

962
00:39:14,008 --> 00:39:18,144
'Cause we do not want an
adversarial situation here.

963
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:20,713
Okay, we want communication,

964
00:39:20,714 --> 00:39:22,481
we want engagement.

965
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,083
So let's all pull together

966
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:25,451
and go back to your desks

967
00:39:25,452 --> 00:39:28,721
and generate me five, ten, 100 ideas

968
00:39:28,722 --> 00:39:30,388
and hit me and my man here up.

969
00:39:30,824 --> 00:39:31,824
Okay?

970
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,193
Thank you.

971
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:36,462
Yeah, I don't know, Stanley.

972
00:39:36,463 --> 00:39:38,463
I... I just don't know if I could ever

973
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:40,632
practically make use of this area.

974
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:43,835
That's just a mezzanine.
You know, it's just a bonus.

975
00:39:43,836 --> 00:39:47,237
you have a... a living room
with under-stair storage.

976
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,775
Sure. It's just...

977
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:52,811
the thing I need storage for
most urgently of all, Stanley,

978
00:39:52,812 --> 00:39:53,978
is me.

979
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:56,480
You know? I'm... I need...

980
00:39:57,617 --> 00:40:00,018
I need storage for myself.

981
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:01,453
Dude, it's just a bed.

982
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:02,620
You're overthinking it.

983
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:07,157
Kendall?

984
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:09,493
Totally.

985
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:11,845
Yep, on my way.

986
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:19,336
So?

987
00:40:19,905 --> 00:40:20,971
It's a maybe.

988
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:26,476
Hey, Ken?

989
00:40:27,278 --> 00:40:28,479
Yo.

990
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,613
Hey.

991
00:40:32,484 --> 00:40:33,718
I got the stuff.

992
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:35,384
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

993
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:38,655
So, what do you think?

994
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:42,026
Uh, of this? I think...

995
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:43,460
it's...

996
00:40:43,461 --> 00:40:47,331
huge. It's, um, it's a very large space.

997
00:40:47,332 --> 00:40:49,266
What's the... what's the footage?

998
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:51,001
Uh, I don't know.

999
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:53,003
Developers overestimated demand,

1000
00:40:53,004 --> 00:40:56,406
so I bought all five units
and my guy's gonna flip 'em.

1001
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:58,074
Yeah, 'cause i... it's...

1002
00:40:58,075 --> 00:40:59,976
an abundance of footage.

1003
00:40:59,977 --> 00:41:02,345
An embarrassment of... of footage.

1004
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:04,181
Yeah.

1005
00:41:04,182 --> 00:41:05,582
It's yours.

1006
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:07,351
I... I mean, until the
market starts to move,

1007
00:41:07,352 --> 00:41:09,153
- but...
- Until it starts to move.

1008
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:10,486
No, I'm serious.

1009
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:12,721
- Yeah.
- Like...

1010
00:41:13,924 --> 00:41:15,892
Yeah, you live here now, Greg.

1011
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:17,227
Okay.

1012
00:41:17,228 --> 00:41:18,595
Uh, cool. Yeah.

1013
00:41:18,596 --> 00:41:22,132
I can take a lot in terms
of psychological pain, so...

1014
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:24,834
Yeah. Sweet, I live here! Nice.

1015
00:41:24,835 --> 00:41:26,269
I'm totally serious.

1016
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,504
Yeah, I know. I needed
a place to live, so...

1017
00:41:28,505 --> 00:41:30,373
Now, uh, now I got it!

1018
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:32,175
Uh, here's your key.

1019
00:41:32,176 --> 00:41:34,210
Until I get a doorman downstairs.

1020
00:41:34,211 --> 00:41:35,578
I'm not fuckin' around.

1021
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,847
Like, it's just gonna be empty.

1022
00:41:37,848 --> 00:41:39,414
- It's not a big deal.
- Kendall.

1023
00:41:40,151 --> 00:41:41,416
What, dude?

1024
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:44,688
This is fuck... Th... this is...

1025
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:46,289
Dude, thank you.

1026
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,756
So much, man.

1027
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,096
Wow. I mean...

1028
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:55,130
- Look at these ceilings.
- Yeah.

1029
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:56,932
Nice height, you got big windows,

1030
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,700
a lot of light.

1031
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,270
Yeah. Have you ever had your own place?

1032
00:42:03,073 --> 00:42:04,207
Fuck yeah.

1033
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:07,076
I was thinking we
could hang out tonight.

1034
00:42:07,077 --> 00:42:08,277
- Yeah.
- Like, in here.

1035
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:10,145
- Sure.
- Have a little party.

1036
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:11,380
Sweet.

1037
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:12,548
Hi!

1038
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:14,684
- Hi!
- Tom Wambsgans.

1039
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:15,851
Hi!

1040
00:42:15,852 --> 00:42:17,353
- Manly handshake.
- Manly handshake.

1041
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:23,459
- Uh...
- I have this...

1042
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,794
overwhelming urge to either
knee someone in the vagina

1043
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:27,096
or spit on the floor.

1044
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:30,032
Hmm. He's been a little
bit nervous about tonight.

1045
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:32,201
Nervous, come the fuck on.

1046
00:42:32,202 --> 00:42:35,137
For din-dins with
firecrotch and normcore?

1047
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,138
Please.

1048
00:42:37,207 --> 00:42:38,741
Well, come on in!

1049
00:42:38,742 --> 00:42:40,342
Have some champagne.

1050
00:42:40,343 --> 00:42:42,878
Enjoy our beautiful room.

1051
00:42:42,879 --> 00:42:45,047
Could spend your whole life
here. That's how I figure it.

1052
00:42:45,048 --> 00:42:47,482
Born on the couch and cremated in here.

1053
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:48,851
Can I get a Diet Coke?

1054
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:50,119
Oh, Tom has a cold,

1055
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,586
and he wants everyone to know.

1056
00:42:51,587 --> 00:42:52,587
Oh.

1057
00:42:52,588 --> 00:42:54,322
Well, we could send out for some saline,

1058
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,558
we could stand around and
watch you do a nasal wash.

1059
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,294
No, no. thank you. I'm good. Thank you.

1060
00:42:59,295 --> 00:43:01,654
I'm hearing some stories
about that brother of ours.

1061
00:43:01,655 --> 00:43:03,046
Apparently...

1062
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,634
You wanna actually drink that?
'Cause I got some stronger shit.

1063
00:43:05,635 --> 00:43:07,168
- Yeah.
- Do you like Japanese whiskey?

1064
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:08,270
- Yeah.
- I've got this one

1065
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:09,971
that tastes like fucking dragonpiss...

1066
00:43:09,972 --> 00:43:11,412
You should try swallowing something.

1067
00:43:14,443 --> 00:43:15,509
Like honey.

1068
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:18,211
I'm fine, thank you.

1069
00:43:19,282 --> 00:43:21,215
Word is he's on maneuvers again.

1070
00:43:21,216 --> 00:43:24,286
Making all kinds of promises
about keeping Vaulter open.

1071
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,120
What? Does Dad know?

1072
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:27,489
Uh, hell no, Dad doesn't know.

1073
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:29,557
He's a shenaniganizing piece of shit.

1074
00:43:29,558 --> 00:43:32,626
But the thing I keep
turning over in my mind is...

1075
00:43:33,729 --> 00:43:35,430
do I tell Dad?

1076
00:43:35,431 --> 00:43:37,631
Because if I drop the shoe on Ken now,

1077
00:43:37,632 --> 00:43:38,965
he's crushed forever.

1078
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:40,901
Uh...

1079
00:43:40,902 --> 00:43:44,938
If Kendall's going
rogue, then... let him.

1080
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:46,774
Sooner or later, it's
gonna blow up in his face.

1081
00:43:46,775 --> 00:43:48,776
I love it when it blows
up in people's faces.

1082
00:43:48,777 --> 00:43:50,976
- You do.
- I do. It's my fuckin' favorite.

1083
00:43:52,781 --> 00:43:54,515
I like how this is working.

1084
00:43:54,516 --> 00:43:56,183
Us. I see a future here.

1085
00:43:56,184 --> 00:43:57,384
Yeah. Sure.

1086
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,485
- No, me too.
- Yeah.

1087
00:43:58,486 --> 00:43:59,966
'Cause, you know, there's an opening.

1088
00:44:01,022 --> 00:44:03,089
Yeah, see, no one sees me coming.

1089
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,458
But I am right on the shoulder.

1090
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:06,760
If Dad announces tomorrow,
he announces me.

1091
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:08,429
Has to, there's no other option.

1092
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,731
I mean, it's fucking insane,
but I am the best he's got.

1093
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:11,765
Yeah.

1094
00:44:11,766 --> 00:44:13,833
Unless... There is one other.

1095
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,237
Who?

1096
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,505
Shiv, should I be worried about Tom?

1097
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:21,374
Tom?

1098
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,244
No, you don't need to
be worried about Tom.

1099
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,312
Okay.

1100
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:26,411
All right.

1101
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,415
How's news, Tom?

1102
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,053
Challenging.

1103
00:44:33,054 --> 00:44:35,054
Tough row to hoe, but, you know...

1104
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,357
think I see a way out.

1105
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:38,658
- It's good, yeah.
- Yeah?

1106
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:40,392
A way out. Good for you, man.

1107
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:44,764
So what is it, this way out?

1108
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,500
Oh, it's early days, and I... Yeah.

1109
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:50,269
I haven't even discussed
it with Logan yet, but...

1110
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,671
Oh, so it's a secret?

1111
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:53,138
That's fucking exciting.

1112
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:54,939
When are you gonna tell
him, at the sleepover?

1113
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:58,978
Well, um, no.

1114
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:01,113
We're-looking in...
Well, I'm looking into

1115
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:02,882
digitizing ATN.

1116
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:06,352
Like, a total overhaul
of the... of the legacy

1117
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:07,854
analog infrastructure.

1118
00:45:07,855 --> 00:45:08,988
Yeah.

1119
00:45:08,989 --> 00:45:10,623
Making a lot of
productivity gains as well,

1120
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,058
so I think your dad
will be pretty pleased.

1121
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:14,158
Fuckin' A.

1122
00:45:15,028 --> 00:45:16,696
Look at the corn-feeder.

1123
00:45:16,697 --> 00:45:18,998
Going all synergies and shit.

1124
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:20,633
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1125
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,800
Worth a shot.

1126
00:45:21,801 --> 00:45:22,833
Thanks, man.

1127
00:45:31,844 --> 00:45:34,112
Where do you buy your
suits, by the way, Tom?

1128
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:35,781
Like, maybe that's why

1129
00:45:35,782 --> 00:45:37,048
I'm just not moving as fast as you.

1130
00:45:37,049 --> 00:45:40,318
I just don't have that,
like, boxy, corporate look.

1131
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,620
Right?

1132
00:45:41,621 --> 00:45:43,789
I mean, I'm sorry, but, like,

1133
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,458
what the fuck? You
look like a Transformer.

1134
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:48,460
Like, wh... what's wrong
with your body, man?

1135
00:45:48,461 --> 00:45:50,829
Rome, come on. There's
nothing wrong with his body,

1136
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,130
it's just fuckin' suits.

1137
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:55,166
What? Come on, we... we've
laughed about it before.

1138
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:56,700
- You have?
- Yeah.

1139
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:58,602
He's thrifty, and he has
the worst taste in suits.

1140
00:45:58,603 --> 00:45:59,904
Totally has terrible Ta...

1141
00:45:59,905 --> 00:46:01,939
You look like a divorce
attorney from the Twin Cities.

1142
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,341
It's partly the walk.
It's like a real...

1143
00:46:04,342 --> 00:46:06,777
- Robot?
- No, agricultural walk.

1144
00:46:09,213 --> 00:46:10,848
Agricultural walk!

1145
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:12,950
You know, I tried to get,
uh, one of his suits tailored

1146
00:46:12,951 --> 00:46:14,284
- by the guy that Dad uses.
- Mm-hmm.

1147
00:46:14,285 --> 00:46:16,486
- But he just looked so, like...
- Hey, Shiv? Fuck off.

1148
00:46:29,067 --> 00:46:31,734
So, I'm probably just gonna
sleep in the guest room

1149
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:33,503
so I don't keep you awake.

1150
00:46:33,504 --> 00:46:35,171
Uh, are you kidding me?

1151
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:37,340
What? We'll both sleep better.

1152
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:38,341
Tom.

1153
00:46:39,276 --> 00:46:40,276
Come on.

1154
00:46:41,144 --> 00:46:43,346
We've just... We've gotten...

1155
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:44,947
tangled up, okay?

1156
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:48,361
Honey,

1157
00:46:48,362 --> 00:46:50,563
you're the only one I can
talk to about this stuff.

1158
00:46:52,222 --> 00:46:53,388
I need you.

1159
00:47:04,924 --> 00:47:07,140
- Now, I have a choice...
- Mm-hmm.

1160
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:09,701
... to make. It's either Gil,

1161
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,059
or it's Dad.

1162
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,852
And it's a bit of a headfuck.

1163
00:47:12,853 --> 00:47:14,210
Okay.

1164
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:15,844
Well, let's break it down.

1165
00:47:18,823 --> 00:47:20,380
'Cause here's what I've been thinking.

1166
00:47:20,381 --> 00:47:22,782
- Mm-hmm.
- What if a good person...

1167
00:47:23,452 --> 00:47:24,653
ran Waystar?

1168
00:47:24,654 --> 00:47:26,788
Yeah, I know. Waystar, it's...

1169
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:28,723
You know, it's the family business.

1170
00:47:29,626 --> 00:47:30,959
It's your inheritance.

1171
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,496
But, you know, you saw what
your dad did to Kendall.

1172
00:47:34,497 --> 00:47:36,999
There's gotta be a chance
he'll do the same to you.

1173
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,933
Get bored of you once he's got you.

1174
00:47:38,934 --> 00:47:40,167
I dunno. Maybe it's about

1175
00:47:40,168 --> 00:47:42,904
keeping your options open, Siobhan.

1176
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:44,906
Oh, yeah. Yes.

1177
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:46,741
Can you not just...

1178
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:49,610
see how it goes and
keep the plates spinning?

1179
00:47:49,611 --> 00:47:52,245
Go Dick Morris, run
things from out back?

1180
00:47:56,317 --> 00:47:57,317
Yeah.

1181
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,054
Uh-huh.

1182
00:48:00,055 --> 00:48:01,287
That's the play.

1183
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:10,397
Okay, where are we on office two?

1184
00:48:10,398 --> 00:48:12,399
I wanna be operational by tomorrow.

1185
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,600
They're outside right now.

1186
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:14,601
Let's go.

1187
00:48:17,872 --> 00:48:19,632
- IT's on their way?
- Mm-hmm.

1188
00:48:22,243 --> 00:48:24,510
They know where it's
going, seventh floor, right?

1189
00:48:56,443 --> 00:48:57,510
We all set?

1190
00:48:57,511 --> 00:48:58,676
Three minutes.

1191
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,786
Okay, guys.

1192
00:49:07,787 --> 00:49:09,921
Everybody, if I could
just have a second.

1193
00:49:11,725 --> 00:49:14,859
I just wanted to update you
on a couple of developments.

1194
00:49:16,395 --> 00:49:18,263
Uh, some of you may have noticed

1195
00:49:18,264 --> 00:49:20,265
servers are down.

1196
00:49:20,266 --> 00:49:23,335
And we're setting a
satellite office on seven.

1197
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:25,837
And I'm afraid I have to inform you,

1198
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,272
you are all dismissed.

1199
00:49:29,308 --> 00:49:31,543
Yeah. You're... You're all fired.

1200
00:49:31,544 --> 00:49:33,678
So, if you can leave your
laptops where they are,

1201
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,712
and hand in your passes,

1202
00:49:34,713 --> 00:49:36,481
security will be coming around now.

1203
00:49:36,482 --> 00:49:38,415
I've been through
everything you've shown me.

1204
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,285
Food and weed,

1205
00:49:40,286 --> 00:49:41,853
those are the only two verticals

1206
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,523
driving revenue, so
we're folding them in

1207
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:47,458
and, uh, yeah, you're all free to leave.

1208
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:49,361
This is a joke.

1209
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,495
You have 15 minutes
to gather your belongings

1210
00:49:51,496 --> 00:49:52,829
and exit the building.

1211
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,033
Separation agreements will
be handed around shortly.

1212
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,835
One week of severance per year served,

1213
00:49:58,836 --> 00:50:00,271
with full non-disclosure.

1214
00:50:00,272 --> 00:50:02,706
Post your little videos.
You get three days.

1215
00:50:02,707 --> 00:50:04,007
What the f...

1216
00:50:04,008 --> 00:50:06,843
Unused vacation days
will not be reimbursed.

1217
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:08,812
Health benefits will be terminated

1218
00:50:08,813 --> 00:50:10,013
at the end of the month.

1219
00:50:10,014 --> 00:50:11,072
That's it.

1220
00:50:11,073 --> 00:50:13,083
I'd like to thank you
all for your hard work.

1221
00:50:13,084 --> 00:50:14,784
You piece of shit.

1222
00:50:21,025 --> 00:50:23,126
- Is that all you got?
- Fuck you.

1223
00:50:23,127 --> 00:50:24,428
Fuck you, man!

1224
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:26,262
Hey. Hey!

1225
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:28,832
Kendall, what the fuck are you doing?

1226
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:30,366
What the fuck is going on?

1227
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:33,436
Yeah, sorry about the,
uh, cloak and dagger.

1228
00:50:33,437 --> 00:50:35,839
I just needed some time
to untangle all your shit,

1229
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,907
find the profit centers,

1230
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,008
keep the union off our back.

1231
00:50:38,009 --> 00:50:40,143
We're already fully
operational on seven.

1232
00:50:40,144 --> 00:50:42,745
- Why?
- Because my dad told me to.

1233
00:50:44,281 --> 00:50:46,182
Because your dad told you to?

1234
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:49,419
Jesus Christ.

1235
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,687
Because your dad told you to?

1236
00:50:53,024 --> 00:50:54,690
You... You fucked it, bro.

1237
00:50:56,994 --> 00:50:57,994
Uh-huh.

1238
00:50:59,563 --> 00:51:02,331
Go find some other chicken coop, cunt.

1239
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:04,567
What...

1240
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:06,636
Are you fucking kidding me?

1241
00:51:06,637 --> 00:51:09,471
Because your dad told you to!

1242
00:51:10,608 --> 00:51:12,341
Are you a fucking idiot?

1243
00:51:13,644 --> 00:51:15,177
Kendall!

1244
00:51:23,621 --> 00:51:26,221
Yo, Ken. Yo, how's it going?

1245
00:51:27,924 --> 00:51:29,191
All good, Greg.

1246
00:51:29,192 --> 00:51:32,163
Just, you know, looking for
love in all the wrong places.

1247
00:51:32,164 --> 00:51:33,229
Yeah.

1248
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,563
No, dude, exactly.

1249
00:51:34,564 --> 00:51:36,265
Listen, Ken, I was, uh,

1250
00:51:36,266 --> 00:51:39,869
super wiped and I... My
legs are just killing me.

1251
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,503
And my lower back.

1252
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:44,073
So do you think you could maybe
bring the party up to yours?

1253
00:51:44,074 --> 00:51:45,975
- Up to mine?
- Up to your place.

1254
00:51:45,976 --> 00:51:47,876
Yeah, I don't think so, Greg.

1255
00:51:49,646 --> 00:51:51,981
You know, I'm just, like...

1256
00:51:51,982 --> 00:51:55,750
I'm looking for pussy like
a fuckin' techno Gatsby.

1257
00:51:56,686 --> 00:51:58,387
Hell yeah! That's...

1258
00:51:58,388 --> 00:52:00,956
Hell yeah, man. Um...

1259
00:52:00,957 --> 00:52:03,458
There's also... some of
your acquaintances are maybe

1260
00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:04,826
humping in my bedroom?

1261
00:52:08,364 --> 00:52:09,697
If you c... Or...

1262
00:52:11,668 --> 00:52:13,468
Can talk to them...

1263
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:15,069
I might like to go for a run

1264
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,905
sometime tomorrow, if
we can make a space.

1265
00:52:16,906 --> 00:52:18,573
I need to test the hamstrings...

1266
00:52:18,574 --> 00:52:20,175
But no paps.

1267
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:22,477
I don't need another shot of
me looking like a used dick.

1268
00:52:22,478 --> 00:52:24,413
You're him, right? You're the guy.

1269
00:52:24,414 --> 00:52:25,547
So they tell me.

1270
00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:28,383
Good to meet you, man! I like you, man.

1271
00:52:28,384 --> 00:52:31,186
I'm nothing without people like you.

1272
00:52:31,187 --> 00:52:32,287
Hey,

1273
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:33,822
you and me, when this work gets done,

1274
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:35,424
we go get a beer. What do you say?

1275
00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:36,758
- Yeah!
- Okay?

1276
00:52:36,759 --> 00:52:38,026
- Yeah. Cool.
- All right.

1277
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:39,987
- Great to meet you. All right.
- Yeah, yeah.

1278
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,096
Hey, you want some gel?

1279
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:53,641
Sorry?

1280
00:52:53,642 --> 00:52:55,443
Some Purell, for your hand.

1281
00:52:55,444 --> 00:52:57,378
How long's it been since
you touched a prole?

1282
00:52:57,379 --> 00:52:58,645
No thank you, Shiv.

1283
00:52:59,448 --> 00:53:00,915
Oh, come on. I'm... I'm kidding.

1284
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:02,183
The joke being what, exactly?

1285
00:53:02,184 --> 00:53:03,684
That I wanna sanitize my hand

1286
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:05,320
after I meet with a guy in the street?

1287
00:53:05,321 --> 00:53:06,354
Thank you. No. I'm good.

1288
00:53:06,355 --> 00:53:08,656
Yeah, it's a pretty shitty joke, Shiv.

1289
00:53:08,657 --> 00:53:09,924
I'm just saying

1290
00:53:09,925 --> 00:53:11,259
that I think that maybe we need to be

1291
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,561
more respectful of the working folk.

1292
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:15,829
Even internally?

1293
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,331
- I mean...
- Okay, yeah. I get it Gil.

1294
00:53:17,332 --> 00:53:19,366
I don't want us
to fall into that trap.

1295
00:53:19,367 --> 00:53:20,625
No, I... I'm sorry, Shiv,

1296
00:53:20,626 --> 00:53:22,970
but I just think that maybe
you like in a kind of a bubble

1297
00:53:22,971 --> 00:53:25,272
and this kind of joke is
okay around your family

1298
00:53:25,273 --> 00:53:26,073
and friends.

1299
00:53:26,074 --> 00:53:27,407
Don't fucking give me that.

1300
00:53:27,408 --> 00:53:28,466
Excuse me?

1301
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:31,278
Don't pull a guilt trip on me
'cause you're selling your soul.

1302
00:53:31,279 --> 00:53:32,980
I'm sorry, do we have a problem here?

1303
00:53:32,981 --> 00:53:36,449
Jesus, Shiv, you need
a banana and a nap?

1304
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:39,151
I think maybe we continue
this conversation in private.

1305
00:53:39,653 --> 00:53:40,787
Why?

1306
00:53:40,788 --> 00:53:42,256
You don't want him to know

1307
00:53:42,257 --> 00:53:43,757
you've still got my dad's
cock in your mouth?

1308
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:46,326
I was discussing an
arrangement you recommended.

1309
00:53:46,327 --> 00:53:48,460
Oh, yeah, you did. Didn't you just, y...

1310
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:49,519
Certainly discussed it.

1311
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,611
I don't understand.

1312
00:53:50,612 --> 00:53:53,041
You're riding me over a
deal you told me to take.

1313
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:54,733
Took it pretty quick though, didn't you?

1314
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:56,769
Rolled over really fucking fast.

1315
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,105
And now you're taking
reach-arounds and...

1316
00:53:59,106 --> 00:54:01,240
flights on a 787.

1317
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:03,842
Where's this coming from, Siobhan?

1318
00:54:03,843 --> 00:54:06,745
I'm sorry, I think
maybe we should just...

1319
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:07,771
reassess.

1320
00:54:07,772 --> 00:54:11,173
Perhaps I... Dick Morris things,
operate from the background?

1321
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:14,353
Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah.

1322
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:16,255
No, you know what I think?
I think you're right.

1323
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:19,225
I think we need to reassess
more comprehensively.

1324
00:54:19,226 --> 00:54:20,759
Mm-hmm.

1325
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,961
I think Nate is right, that your...

1326
00:54:22,962 --> 00:54:25,862
connections to Tom, ATN, are...

1327
00:54:26,565 --> 00:54:28,466
a distraction.

1328
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:31,135
Oh yeah? Well you know
what? Actually, I'm out.

1329
00:54:32,838 --> 00:54:35,673
Actually, I just fired you, Shiv.

1330
00:54:35,674 --> 00:54:37,742
If you'd even noticed.

1331
00:54:37,743 --> 00:54:40,477
Well, I already fuckin' quit,
if you had any antennae.

1332
00:54:49,688 --> 00:54:51,488
Okay, it's done.

1333
00:54:52,524 --> 00:54:54,091
Vaulter's dead.

1334
00:54:54,092 --> 00:54:56,126
Four-hundred and
seventy-six off the payroll,

1335
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:57,861
full-timers, freelance...

1336
00:54:57,862 --> 00:55:00,331
I, uh, negotiated an
early break from the lease

1337
00:55:00,332 --> 00:55:02,132
and hired an editor and five interns

1338
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:03,500
for the two remaining verticals.

1339
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,369
the rest will be user-generated,

1340
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,338
reviews, upload pics, all that stuff.

1341
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:11,175
Also, I harvested a ton of ideas

1342
00:55:11,176 --> 00:55:13,043
from the Vaulter staff before they left.

1343
00:55:13,044 --> 00:55:14,311
IP and start-up ideas.

1344
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:18,047
Most of it's, you know,
bullshit but... you never know.

1345
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:21,750
We'll say you tried to keep it alive.

1346
00:55:23,121 --> 00:55:25,289
Valiant efforts, et cetera.

1347
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,923
I'm good. I'll wear it.

1348
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,228
I should take this.

1349
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,799
- Yeah?
- Dad?

1350
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,069
I told Gil.

1351
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,005
I'm ready. Let's get started.

1352
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:44,940
Start... looping me in.

1353
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,074
That's great.

1354
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,043
I'll be in touch.

1355
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,084
Everything okay?

1356
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,919
Oh, yeah. Usual headaches.

1357
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,954
Hey. Should I be in this?

1358
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,223
Roman,

1359
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:02,758
your brother's gonna be
working in here from now on.

1360
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:03,816
Oh, yeah?

1361
00:56:03,817 --> 00:56:06,261
I need him across the proxy battle.

1362
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,629
Can't afford communication slips.

1363
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:10,269
Okay?

1364
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,270
What are you waiting for?

1365
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,738
A kiss?

1366
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:20,007
Fuck off. Be gone. Bye bye.

1367
00:56:30,786 --> 00:56:32,319
Yes? Can I help you?

1368
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,556
Fuck you looking at?

1369
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,091
You did good, son.

1370
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,124
Thank you.

1371
00:56:38,293 --> 00:56:39,625
Make yourself at home.

1372
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:04,817
Comfortable?

1373
00:57:28,442 --> 00:57:31,210
Hey. Can I get a pack of
American Spirit Yellow?

1374
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:34,147
One of these.

1375
00:58:22,517 --> 00:58:30,517
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

1376
00:59:31,814 --> 00:59:33,700
There were some doubts as to...

1377
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:36,644
whether an acquisition is
really what we need right now.

1378
00:59:36,645 --> 00:59:38,902
It is. The bigger the better.

1379
00:59:38,903 --> 00:59:40,927
And I have it.

1380
00:59:40,928 --> 00:59:43,185
This is a disaster.

1381
00:59:43,186 --> 00:59:44,575
We need to stop him.

1382
00:59:44,576 --> 00:59:47,213
Could you sit out the
corporate retreat this year?

1383
00:59:47,214 --> 00:59:49,306
Nah. It's a morale-booster.

1384
00:59:49,307 --> 00:59:51,991
Someone spiked the deal.

1385
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:54,260
Which one of you boys did it?

1386
00:59:54,463 --> 00:59:59,056
Here's news: I... will... win.
