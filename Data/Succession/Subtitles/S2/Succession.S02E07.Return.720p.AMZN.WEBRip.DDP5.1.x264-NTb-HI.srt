Christchurch, do it that way.

LOGAN: I need to make
some calls.

Kerry, we're hunkering. Frank,
Gerri, let's get down to it.

173
00:06:57,898 --> 00:06:59,773
It's going to be an all-nighter.

174
00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:04,732
- Hey, Rome.
- Yeah.

175
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:06,023
What's happening? Where's Dad?

176
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:07,583
- We're supposed to be talking.
- Ye...

177
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,165
Yeah, yeah, something came in.
He's hunkering.

178
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,398
He wanted me to tell you,
"Sorry, rain check.

179
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:14,690
Maybe in the a.m. Maybe."
Are your nips hard?

180
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:17,398
They must be, because
you are so out in the cold.

184
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:53,898
Thanks for making the time.

185
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:55,481
No, not at all. Big priority.

No, I managed to push all
my gropes to this afternoon.

This is my colleague,

191
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,419
...and we're with
Blanch and Partners.

192
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:08,815
Yes.

193
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:12,189
We are helping to investigate
historic sexual abuse...

194
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:14,189
- TOM: Uh-huh.
- ...and associated wrongdoings

195
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:15,648
at Brightstar Cruises.

196
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:17,981
- Sure.
- So, as head of the division

197
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:20,332
- we were hoping you could...
- Well, briefly, I, uh, I...

198
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:24,356
I followed Bill's long reign.
Um, I was but a minnow

199
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,732
trailing in the wake of...
of Bill,

200
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,981
the big sperm whale,
the legend. (CHUCKLES)

201
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:31,690
Sure, but in terms of your time
at Parks, were you aware

202
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:34,231
of any historical allegations
that had been dealt with

203
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:36,815
other than in a way outlined
in the corporate guidelines?

204
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:39,898
In my brief spell,
um, I don't...

205
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:42,898
at this time, recall anything
that at that time,

206
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:46,523
would have caused me
any real concern.

207
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:49,732
Okay. Well, we can take a dig
into that in a moment,

208
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:51,064
- but for now...
- Sure.

209
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:53,189
...in terms of records
and document-keeping...

210
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:55,231
Uh-huh.

211
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:57,273
Well, we need to locate all
written information

212
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,106
relevant to this investigation,

213
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:00,898
and safeguard it
from destruction,

214
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:02,732
negligence, malfeasance.

215
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:04,981
Are you aware
of any document destruction

216
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:06,939
which might hinder
our inquiries?

217
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:12,356
I... I think, um...

218
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:15,939
You know what? I...
You know what? I just...

219
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:18,023
I've just realized
we're gonna be here for a while,

220
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:20,023
and I wanna give you
my best attention,

221
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:21,898
but I really need to pee.

pathetically weak bladder.

I'm like an old woman

But I'm... I'm so sorry.

Not Serge, right?

- No, sir. Serge is off rotation.
- LOGAN: Good.

230
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:44,315
I like a boring bastard
flying me.

231
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:46,648
Serge always looks as if
his dick's still wet,

232
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:49,356
and he's gonna give me the name
of a good fucking pinot.

00:10:57,815 --> 00:10:59,148
Are you all right, son?

234
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:02,106
Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm good.
Thanks for the ride.

235
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:04,106
LOGAN: It's good to see you.

236
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:07,064
Good to see you, too, Dad.
I hope we can swing it with Mom.

237
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:10,981
Yeah, I... I was gonna say,

238
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:13,607
you know,
that thing up at Argestes...

239
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,815
Oh. No, yeah.
Mm-mm. It's not...

240
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:19,898
I... I didn't even know
you were there.

241
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:22,523
I mean, if I did, I would...
Y'know?

242
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:25,023
Oh, I know. Yeah, I know. Sure.

243
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:30,231
Did I even make contact?

244
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:34,148
Um... I don't... think s...

245
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:36,315
Yeah, I'm not quite sure
what we're talking about,

246
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:38,106
- to be honest.
- Because...

247
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:42,565
that's not something I'd do.
Y'know?

248
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:46,648
Yeah, I know. I know that.
I know. I know.

249
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:52,732
Fucking...

250
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:57,939
cars, buildings, everywhere.

251
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:01,732
RHEA JARRELL:
He didn't tell you I was coming?

252
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:03,356
No. No, he did not.

253
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,148
For a media guy, he's not
the greatest communicator.

254
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:08,315
RHEA: Thank you.

255
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:10,690
I was going anyway to check out
some theater, and he asked

256
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:13,064
would I talk through
a couple things with him.

257
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,666
- Bounce some stuff.
- KENDALL: Uh-huh.

258
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,690
- You feelin' bouncy?
- Honestly?

259
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:19,189
A little deflated.

260
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,106
After all the retreats
I've done,

261
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:23,356
you know,
still got a bit of an ego.

262
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,023
Uh-huh.

263
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:27,732
Hey! Hi! (CHUCKLING)

264
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,189
(CHUCKLING) Hey!

Oh. Hey, Rhea.

- Dad, Rhea's here.
- LOGAN: Yeah, well...

267
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:37,898
Not a big deal.

268
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:40,231
ROMAN: Course it's not
a big deal. Why would it be?

269
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:43,356
- LOGAN: It's convenient.
- Okay, well, here we go.

270
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Roy boys on tour,
and we got 'em in all sizes.

Alpha, beta, cuck.

272
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:51,398
He's fucking leaving
the country?

273
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:52,981
Rather than speak to me.

274
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,607
How long have you known this?

275
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,981
Plans change, so...
He wanted to apologize.

276
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:58,148
Bullshit.

277
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:00,356
- TOM: Hey.
- You...

278
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:02,189
Hey, Shiv. Hey.

279
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:03,857
- Hey.
- What... Hey, oh...

280
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,499
- Do you know he's gone?
- TOM: Can I ask you about something?

281
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:06,874
Can you believe you this?
He's gone.

282
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:08,457
And his fucking flunkies
didn't even tell me,

283
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,690
running interference for him.
I won't have it.

284
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:12,207
I'm not gonna chase him
around the party

285
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:13,773
like a schoolgirl
with a crush.

286
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:15,273
No, absolutely.

287
00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:17,607
Hey, um, I just wanted to check
it definitely is bullshit

288
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,481
this...
this internal investigation?

289
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,291
Y'know, he hasn't even responded
to the memo.

290
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:23,857
TOM: Because that didn't feel
all that bullshitty.

291
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,939
It wasn't all softballs?

292
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,981
You ever been hit in the face
with a softball?

293
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:30,607
I mean, just how inside this
are you?

294
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,416
'Cause there isn't a world,
is there, in which I get

295
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,690
hung out to dry, in which
I have to play the fuckbag?

296
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,023
- Is there? I mean...
- No.

297
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,481
...he supports me, right?
Logan?

298
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:39,082
I mean, never mind the jokes
and the "ha ha,"

299
00:13:39,106 --> 00:13:41,023
he's not gonna fry me, is he?

300
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:44,523
No, Tom. No. I... You know what?
I think I have to go out there.

301
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:47,106
I have to... go and fix this,
okay?

302
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:53,565
You okay?

303
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:55,607
Sure.

304
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,939
RHEA: Oh, sure. "Sure."
Don't poke the bear.

305
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,981
He can take anything.
Load him up.

306
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:02,440
Oh, I don't fucking know.

307
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:05,523
All this energy.
I'm gonna have to fight now

308
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:07,648
for every fucking
shareholder vote.

309
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:10,356
My ex-wife,
my old friends turning.

310
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,064
I kill Sandy. Sandy kills me.
So fucking what?

311
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:16,023
The next Zucker-fucker
comes along

312
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,898
and swallows you whole.

313
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,356
Shits you out as an app.

314
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,023
(WEAKLY) Yeah...

315
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:25,648
We've had some private polling
on potential next CEOs,

316
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,064
who'd play well.

317
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,773
I'd value your thoughts.

318
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:30,273
On the kids?

319
00:14:30,356 --> 00:14:31,898
Who's got it? Huh?

320
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:34,690
I... (CHUCKLES)
I could do with a clear eye.

321
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,440
As execs, okay. Well...

322
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Shiv thinks she's smarter
than she is.

323
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:44,148
Roman could actually be good,

324
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:45,398
but, um...

325
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:48,023
but nowhere near right now.

326
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:49,857
Kendall's... I don't know.

327
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,481
It's like you put him
in a big diaper,

328
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,523
and now he can shit himself
whenever he likes.

329
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:55,565
- (CHUCKLES)
- Uh, he has all the shots

330
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:57,148
but he doesn't know
when to play them.

331
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,440
- (LOGAN LAUGHS)
- I... I don't know. (CHUCKLING)

332
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:02,648
Yikes.

333
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:06,148
Look at them.
Fucking coochie-fucking-coo.

334
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:08,690
Yeah, I haven't seen him
like this for a while.

335
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:11,815
Yeah, not since Sally Anne
and the summer of the horses.

336
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:14,023
- Remember that shit?
- Right.

I wanted to ask you.
I was in the area, actually,

Uh, yeah. Okay, I...

392

- Uh, a little bit jittery.
- Mm-hmm.

Uh, a bit of a stress comedown.

394

- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
- You know, I, uh, got a haircut.

Even though I didn't really need
a haircut.

396
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:40,957
- Right.
- I think I just wanted someone

397

to touch my head, you know.
Soothing.

- Uh-huh. Great. Great.

399
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,148
So, here's my thing.
Greg, you know the papers?

400
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:50,315
The copies? I want them.

401
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:51,939
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

402
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:54,064
I did my part of the deal.
You got the office,

403
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:56,106
a pretty little Gustav Klimt
poster up there,

404
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:58,565
and now it's time for me
to habeas the corpus.

405
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:02,064
GREG: No, right, right. I... I...
I mean, I just guess, uh...

406
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,939
I... I just guess that they're,
like, my insurance policy.

407
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:06,939
Yeah, but you don't need
an insurance policy.

408
00:18:07,023 --> 00:18:08,732
Well, in case things
were to turn nasty.

409
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:10,064
They're not gonna turn nasty.

410
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:12,898
Okay? No one's gonna
break your legs, y'know?

411
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:14,565
Okay, well that feels
a bit nasty.

412
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:17,732
But it's the insurance
which is causing the nastiness.

413
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:21,773
If you were uninsured, you'd be
a lot safer. Ironically.

414
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:23,898
Okay, well,
they're not actually here,

415
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:25,957
- so I don't really know what to tell you.
- Okay. Greg. Greg, Greg. Look.

416
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:30,690
Okay, you played your hand
very well. I like it.

copies of sensitive documents.

I keep them at...

- Dude.

...we're gonna dispose of them
off-premises.

Okay.

00:30:55,231 --> 00:30:56,648
Um, before I hand these over,

677
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:58,690
could... could I actually make
one final request?

678
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,857
Uh, Leo, my neighbor here,

679
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:03,690
uh, he sneezes
like a cartoon character,

680
00:31:03,773 --> 00:31:05,732
so, I was thinking maybe
a corner office...

681
00:31:05,815 --> 00:31:08,523
Don't overplay your hand,
Gregory.

682
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:09,773
Come on.

683
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,106
- Okay, w...
- Come on.

684
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,898
"Secret," Greg?

685
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:33,023
Yeah?

686
00:31:33,106 --> 00:31:36,148
But not "Top Secret."
Interesting.

687
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:37,732
Just "Secret," that's smart.

688
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:40,064
Just so people know, you know,

689
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,148
- that these are secret.
- They're secret. Yeah.

690
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:44,064

the janitors,

691
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:46,607

and, uh...

692
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,939
But look, the actual envelope
says "Receipts."

693
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:52,148
Ooh! But they're not, in fact,
receipts.

00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:42,273

you know, we appreciate
what you tried to do for us.

712

00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,315
Thank you.

719
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:08,732

and I like you.

720

Well, I mean... maybe...

to just let him know, you know?
