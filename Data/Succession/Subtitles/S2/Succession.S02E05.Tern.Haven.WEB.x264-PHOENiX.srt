- Your sister's just in for the day.
- Oh yeah?

3
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:12,712
Just to observe.

4
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:15,215
Rhea, we got her.

5
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:16,297
The family trusts her.

6
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:18,282
You get her on board, that's huge.

7
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:19,390
I want Pierce.

8
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:21,039

We did have one thing to mention.

17

Twenty-four billion dollars.
And they can trust me.

18
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:44,524

- So, as you know,

76
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:13,696
the good news is that the
Pierces are entertaining

77
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:16,358
our offer, but, bad news,
they're inquiring about

78
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:18,568

hence this weekend.

00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:34,951
why this time is gonna
be different, Dad?

87
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:36,052
Lack of readership.

outflanked left and right.

So, to ensure that
everything goes smoothly,

95
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:55,704
we have prepared a few do's
and don'ts for the weekend.

96
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:58,039
Oh, so, what, don't
shit in the soup tureen?

97
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,143
Topics to stay clear of:
Ravenhead, ATN, Israel,

98
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:04,513
Brightstar, and Cruise's rumor mill.

99
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:07,516
- GERRI KILLMAN: Mm.
- Steer onto gossip, investments,

100
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:10,619
art, movies... Tittle-tattle.
Wider cultural interests.

101
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,387
Well, what if your
wider cultural interest

102
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:14,756
is hate-jerking to Instagram?
Just asking for a friend.

103
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:16,792
Ooh, me! She's talking about me.

Oh, two drinks maximum.

105
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,428
Not big drinkers.

106
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:23,999
That's okay. Nobody here has any
glaring substance abuse issues

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,034

down the company, right?

saying, but no. We, uh...

115

We need to wear the hair
shirt, call you a shitbag,

116

Okay. Got it. Hair shirt.

118

handle the big picture.

119
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:56,560
Uh, remind me again, does
Rhea work for the company?

120
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:58,629
Uh, remind us, do you?

121
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,698
I'm just asking if we
really wanna entrust

122
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,300
the fate of our company
to another company's CEO.

123
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,769

- Guys, what dad is saying

126
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:12,709

role and execute, okay?

127
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,178
Well, my worry is that Kendall

128
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:16,613

129
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:18,348
LOGAN: Thanks for all your help.

130
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:23,587
We need this. Bagging Pierce
is the key to our proxy defense.

131
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:29,258
And the defense is life itself.

00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:04,990
I want you on Nan.

333
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:06,558
Okay, Dad, we don't
have to be so schematic.

334
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,793
LOGAN: Romulus.

335
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:10,095
When you laugh, please
do it at the same volume

336
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:11,563
as everyone else.

337
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:13,199
We didn't get you from a hyena farm.

338
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,000
- Thanks, Pop.
- The good news is that Nan

339
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,869
already seems to be spending
the money in her head,

340
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,838
but she can still be
swayed by her family,

341
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,105
so every cousin counts.

342
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:21,974
Oh, I think Marnie might
be leaning "sell", so...

343
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,377
Marnie isn't a problem. Now, everybody,

344
00:18:25,378 --> 00:18:28,580
stay in your lanes. Who's on Peter?

345
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:29,815
Yeah, I got it, Dad.

346
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:31,550
Oh, oh, you got it? I'm
so impressed. Shut up.

347
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,218
Okay, a bit of Lincoln
Center chat, okay?

348
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:34,886
He's worried that we're barbarians.

349
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:36,154
- And Naomi.
- ROMAN: Yeah.

350
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:37,356
- Hit Naomi!
- Got it.

351
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:38,489
ROMAN: Okay, onwards.

352
00:18:39,592 --> 00:18:40,837
SHIV: Can't stand up to Maxim?

353
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:42,180
ROMAN: Tabs, you gonna help me on that?

354
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:43,671
- He's an asshole!
- SHIV: What part of your policy

355
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:44,962
- was he "not right now"?
- CONNOR: No, no, no, no, no.

356
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:46,863
No, everything. He's dismissing.

357
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:55,006
- Well, nice work so far.
- MARCIA:<i> Merci beaucoup.</i>

358
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:57,742
I'm very excited to be getting top marks

359
00:18:57,743 --> 00:18:59,676
along with your other pupils.

Thank you so much.

many breakers you had?

00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:48,324

NAN: Oh, stop!

368
00:19:58,437 --> 00:19:59,569
Now...

369
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:02,105
Grace.

(NAN CLEARS HER THROAT)

371
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:06,142
I'm afraid we've gone
so Unitarian out here

372
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:08,044
that we've given up on poor Jesus,

373
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:10,613
and we have started
worshipping Shakespeare!

(INHALES) Hmm.

377
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:24,828
The purest treasure...
mortal time affords

378
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,728
is spotless reputation.

379
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:32,335
That away, men are but gilded loam,

380
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:33,836
or painted clay.

381
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:39,675
Mine honor is my life; both grow in one.

382
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:43,410
Take honor from me, and my life is done.

383

Hey, that was awesome.

387
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:06,534
- I'm Kendall.
- I know. Naomi.

388
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:08,435
Yeah, I know.

389
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:12,574
So, uh, are you, like, a...

390
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,343
- an actress or like a poetess?
- NAOMI: Oh... (LAUGHS)

391
00:21:15,344 --> 00:21:17,879
Or something? Because
that was pretty legit.

392
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,214
Oh, I, uh, volunteer

393
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:21,682
at a drug addiction treatment
center in Mill Valley,

394
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:24,419
and I continue my
recovery there as well.

395
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:30,291
Oh. Oh, wow. That... That's great. I...

396
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,792
Yeah, I'm actually in recovery myself.

397
00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:37,932
- I know.
- Okay. (CHUCKLES)

398
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:43,304
My not-so-spotless
reputation precedes me.

399
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:46,773
- (LAUGHS) No, I could just tell.
- KENDALL: Really?

400
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:49,376
Oh, okay. Right.

401
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:53,915
I'd like to have three novels
and a memoir going at once.

402
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,652
- It's like natural selection.
- Oh, brother, I hear that.

403
00:21:57,653 --> 00:22:01,622
- Are you a reader?
- Me? Oh, big time. Yeah.

404
00:22:01,623 --> 00:22:05,593
Can you recommend anything
that Oprah isn't pushing?

405
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:09,530
- Any new fiction?
- (LAUGHS) Right?

406
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:13,300
Oh! Uh, yeah, sure, I can. Um...

407
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:16,470
I rather enjoyed <i>The Electric Circus.</i>

408
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:18,039
<i>- The Electric Circus.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,708
- MARNIE: Who's the author?
- What was that? What?

410
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:23,142
- Who's the author?
- ROMAN: Oh! Oh, gosh.

411
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:29,783
I wanna say... Shit. Who was
it? It was, oh... Timothy Lipton.

412
00:22:29,784 --> 00:22:32,418
SHIV: Uh-huh? What's it about? Rom?

413
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,020
Uh, what's <i>The Electric Circus</i> about?

414
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:37,490
- Uh-huh.
- It is about a young man

415
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:38,858
making his way through the world,

416
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,061
except in two different time periods.

417
00:22:41,062 --> 00:22:43,070
It kind of switches
back and forth between...

418
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:46,499
The circus part is
a, you know, metaphor.

419
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,101
For what?

420
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:51,037
ROMAN: For the anxiety
of modern life, Siobhan.

421
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,572
MARNIE: I'm not seeing it on Google.

422
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:54,373
You said it's called
"The Electric Circus"?

423
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,042
Yeah. I thou... I mean, shit.
Is it<i> The Electric Circus?</i>

424
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,310
Well, I think it's called...

425
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,079
CONNOR: That's all very
interesting, but let's just

426
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,347
- agree to disagree, shall we?
- Sure! (LAUGHS)

427
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:05,784
(LAUGHS) Well, that's just
the sort of expert analysis

428
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:08,286
I'd expect from a deep-state
wonk with both lips

429
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,188
firmly glued to the Soros teat.

430
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,057
Oh, well, you can't change Washington

431
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,859
without knowing Washington

432
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,060
I mean, can you name me

433
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,795
one member of the House
Commerce Committee?

434
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,420
Oh, uh, yeah, I think I know one.

435
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:21,299
Uh, Representative
Ferdinand D. Who-Gives-A-Shit

436
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,503
from the great state
of No-One-Fucking-Cares.

437
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:27,806
Well, I'm convinced. I
mean, clear some space

438
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,308
on Mount Rushmore, folks! (LAUGHS)

you said the wrecking ball.

Oh, right. Because it
was a joke. (LAUGHS)

450
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:54,599
Of course.

Are you pleased to be
out of politics, Siobhan?

452
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:59,871
Oh, yes, I am. I'm getting over
it like a nasty stomach bug.

453
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,606
- Mm-hmm.
- It can be a dirty business.

454
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,908

cable news behemoth.

We can discuss the white nationalist
elephant in the room, can't we?

Tug on its trunk a bit?

458
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,188
I'm not operationally involved.

459
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,923
(LAUGHS) Come on.

460
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:22,393
No, no, no, I let my
people do their own thing.

461
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:26,096
I mean, if you... If you
wanna talk ATN, you know,

00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,998
Tom's the barbarian.

NAOMI: Wait, you don't
even believe your own stuff?

466
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:41,477
Well, I've always wanted to
balance Waystar's portfolio

with, um...

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,649
with... voice...

- From the left?
- Well, no. Pierce isn't...

Your people just follow the
truth, wherever it leads, right?

people are just hacks.

- But we like 'em.
- Come on! (LAUGHS)

474
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:04,601
I mean, I guess our... our people

475
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:06,536
try to follow the truth, too, Shiv.

476
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:09,071
You give them what they need,
we give them what they want.

477
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,740
We make a good match.

478
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:12,708
Of course. Right. No, Dad...

479
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:17,412
I think we, Dad, just wants
a bigger tent, a bigger pie.

480
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:19,414
It means more profit,

481
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:21,550
and then more investment.

482
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:25,186
So, I suppose that just
makes me a prim little matron,

483
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:27,188
if I object to being fumbled

484
00:25:27,189 --> 00:25:28,823
by the invisible hand of the market?

485
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:30,592
Th... That's... No.

486
00:25:30,593 --> 00:25:32,127
That's not what I meant. I...

487
00:25:32,128 --> 00:25:35,564
Sure, a fair exchange
isn't exactly robbery,

488
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:38,600
and money does allegedly
make the world go round, so...

489
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:41,002
Money? Money is a social construct,

490
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:43,805
whereas virtue, integrity,

491
00:25:43,806 --> 00:25:45,707
these things actually exist.

492
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:48,042
Well, the... Just... Well,
because just this morning,

493
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:50,278
I went to the store, and
I bought a pound of ham,

494
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,780
and I paid for it by, you know,

495
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:52,947
telling them I was really worried

496
00:25:52,948 --> 00:25:54,015
about the environment.

497
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:56,050
(LAUGHTER)

498
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:58,086
SHIV: Don't mind Tom, he
finds other people's integrity

499
00:25:58,087 --> 00:25:59,821
a personal affront, for some reason.

500
00:25:59,822 --> 00:26:02,757
(LAUGHS) Well, yes, that's...
Thank you, I'm a piece of dirt.

501
00:26:02,758 --> 00:26:04,659
- (LAUGHTER)
- Oh, yep. Yep. I'll take it.

502
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,060
SHIV: Right! (LAUGHS)

503
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:10,331
Wait a minute, but Tom, Tom,
if there was an acquisition,

504
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:12,066
then, as head of news,

505
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,735
you would be the guy in charge
of our crown jewels, right?

506
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:17,505
Oh, well, we'd have to see about that.

507
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:19,573
Ooh! Hear that, Tom?

508
00:26:19,574 --> 00:26:21,975
Sounds dicey. Got a pitch?

509
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:25,513
Tom, everything rests on
what you're about to say.

510
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:27,782
- (LAUGHTER)
- NAN: Oh, lay off him!

511
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:30,250
Oh, wait a minute,
though. I didn't hear.

512
00:26:30,251 --> 00:26:33,420
So, would he stay on
as the head of news?

513
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,926
- I...
- Ooh, king of edible leaves,

514
00:26:38,927 --> 00:26:40,560
His Majesty, the spinach.

515
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,766
Look, I just, uh... I think there's...

516
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,735
The business, the journalistic values...

517
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,933
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a lot of admirers in this family.

518
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,019
That's all.

519
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,843
Uh, like all recent
converts, Shiv is a zealot.

520
00:26:56,844 --> 00:27:00,447
TOM: (LAUGHS) I think what
we can all agree on is that

521
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:04,150
it's great for people to
communicate, of whatever stripe.

522
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:07,286
I think it was Thoreau
who said of the telegraph,

523
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:10,657
"Maine may speak to Texas,
but what if they have nothing

524
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:12,726
- to say to one another?
- (LAUGHTER)

525
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:15,027
That should be engraved into
the bezel of every iPhone

526
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:16,596
- in the world.
- NAN: Oh!

527
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:20,166
- Hear, hear! The bezel.
- Have you spoken to Shirley?

528
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:23,470
I'm so sorr... Will you excuse
us for two seconds? I'm so worried

529
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:25,638
- about our... It's a...
- SHIV: Our dog, Mondale.

530
00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:27,173
It's a dog thing. So silly. Sorry to...

531
00:27:27,174 --> 00:27:28,841
SHIV: Is very ill at the moment.

532
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:29,908
TOM: Arthritis. We think it's arthritis.

533
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:31,277
- NAN: So sorry.
- TOM: His hips.

534
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:33,144
SHIV: Excuse us. Sorry.

535
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:37,449
They have a dog. A dog named Mondale.

536
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,352
- PETER: Oh!
- That's helpful, right?

537
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:40,386
PETER: Yeah, it is.

538
00:27:40,387 --> 00:27:42,764
This is... This is what happens.
You get given the keys to the castle,

539
00:27:42,765 --> 00:27:45,191
and then you get paralyzed,
staring into the eyes of the cobra.

540
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:46,792
You're riding me pretty hard in there.

541
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:47,894
- (SIGHS)
- You think I should

542
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:49,085
- fight back more?
- You know, and then,

543
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,009
he smells the vacillation,
and then he's just...

544
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,432
He's got you. You're done.
He's juiced another lemon.

545
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:55,401
It would be nice if you
stopped beating up on me too.

546
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:56,764
- What?
- Maybe you could stop

547
00:27:56,765 --> 00:27:59,338
- beating up on me too.
- What? What do...

548
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:01,806
That's just nothing. That's silly.

549
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:04,342
- What... No-one cares.
- Well, technically, I care.

550
00:28:04,343 --> 00:28:05,810
- I care.
- Well, sometimes you say

551
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,581
stupid things. You know, he's
got me second-guessing myself.

552
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:11,103
I'm wavering on the best
strategy for landing a deal

553
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:12,206
that I don't even like.

554
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:16,988
- I really want this!
- I know.

555
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:19,124
Really, I wanna be
sitting at that table.

556
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:22,092
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- (BREATHES TREMULOUSLY)

557
00:28:23,362 --> 00:28:24,494
Listen to me.

558
00:28:25,932 --> 00:28:27,564
You are sitting at the table.

559
00:28:28,935 --> 00:28:30,034
You are.

560
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:33,504
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

561
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:37,573
I'm good. Mm-hmm. Let's go.

562
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:42,546
TABITHA: They're trying to
adopt. You know, the list is,

563
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:45,782
like, insane, so I'm thinking,
like, if they can't have a baby

564
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:49,486
in six months, I'm just gonna,
you know, offer them my womb.

565
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:51,422
Why not? I'm young, I'm hardy.

566
00:28:51,423 --> 00:28:53,743
MARNIE: I have a friend who
did that. It was so great.

567
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:56,951
- TABITHA: Mm.
- Uh, but if it's not too rude to ask,

568
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:59,463
then what about you two?

569
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:02,966
TABITHA: Oh, you mean us having
a baby? No, we're not planning

570
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:04,005
- to have a baby, because...
- Oop.

571
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:05,469
... that would require us having sex.

572
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,730
- Whoa! Hey now.
- PETER: I'm so sorry.

573
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:09,973
- I don't mean to pry.
- Oh, yes you did.

574
00:29:09,974 --> 00:29:12,275
No, no, no, no. It's
totally fine. That's just...

575
00:29:12,276 --> 00:29:15,645
That's, like, not how we
do it. It's not our thing.

576
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:17,981
We're kind of like eunuch besties.

577
00:29:17,982 --> 00:29:20,183
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- It works for us.

578
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:23,620
It's a joke, obviously.
She's kidding. We're actually

579
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:27,591
quite relentless in that
regard. Just Fuck City.

580
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:30,794
- (PUNCHES PALM)
- Bingo, bango, bongo.

581
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:33,763
TABITHA: Anyway, you
don't have any kids, right?

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

583

- Oh? Uh...

Yeah. Yep, you bet.

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,335
NAN: Marcia, so, so tell me.
You... You grew up in Beirut.

586
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:48,544
What was that like?

587
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:51,814
LOGAN: Well, she... She doesn't
really like to talk about it.

588
00:29:51,815 --> 00:29:55,084
Or you don't like to ask about it.

589
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:59,422
Well, um... when we first
met, the first or second night,

590
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,392
we stayed up all night, um...

591
00:30:02,393 --> 00:30:05,895
And she told me her whole life story.

592
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:10,033
If I had a year, I couldn't
tell you my whole life.

593
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:13,936
- LOGAN: Uh-huh. Fine.
- Interesting.

594
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,005
Another glass for both of you?

595
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:18,240
Well, now, we tend to
kind of keep it to...

596
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:19,340
Yes, thank you.

His cellar is all New World,
and it doesn't suit me.

Well, why didn't you say?

600
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:33,288
It suits you, so it can suit me.
See? I'm not a difficult person.

00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,524
- Uh-huh.
- NAN: Well, as long as

602
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:39,461
the fat is being chewed,
I suppose I would be remiss

603
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,196
not to mention that
you're being targeted

604
00:30:41,197 --> 00:30:43,565
for acquisition yourself, correct?

605
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:45,633
Oh, oh, that. Well, that's...

606
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:47,536

I never believed that the takeover bid

Oh, look, I have to ask.
The internal differences.

614
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,660
- Have they been smoothed over?
- Oh, very much so.

615
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:18,966
And any thought given to whom
you might hand over the keys?

616
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:21,435
Why, Madam, that is very forward.

617
00:31:21,436 --> 00:31:22,935

really do the job.

- Just whisper it in my ear.
- You know, I'll start to think

630

I'm not wanted.

- Roman, what's happening?
- Mm. My life just ended.

637
00:32:30,303 --> 00:32:33,505
It's been discussed, um,
but I don't think we're quite

638
00:32:33,506 --> 00:32:37,909
- at the point where, uh...
- No, not any time soon.

639
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,579
We've, uh... We've
discussed the transition

640
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,415
- and some arrangements.
- We won't bore you.

No! (LAUGHS) But I though we
could tell you all, though,

as friends.

644
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:55,927
was a little bit premature.
Seems like you guys

00:32:55,928 --> 00:32:57,329
are still working some things out.

00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,799
No, no, Peter, don't worry,
this is just family hijinks,

00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,968
- as usual. We're good.

it is such a beautiful,
clear night out. Uh...

a little after-dinner stargaze?

my PhD at Columbia in '89,

00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,892

call a "learned astronomer".

I could show you through, uh...

fucked it yourselves, so...

what a shit-piñata. That was like...

That was like the most
Roy thing I have ever seen.

688
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:15,122

really think that so much as...

That my wrist will never fully heal?

827
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:46,498
Or there's photos of me
caked in blood with my femur

828
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:50,869
- poking out?
- We all have something, right?

829
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:54,172
This deal isn't gonna change all that.

830
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:58,344
- I mean, all I would say is...
- Oh, you've got it all sorted.

831
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,345
Don't block your own escape.

832
00:44:01,714 --> 00:44:06,783
Just imagine getting
out from under all this.

833
00:44:08,253 --> 00:44:10,921
Right? You can take the money...

834
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:12,989
and you can just get the fuck out.

835
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,826
And then what?

836
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:18,955
Then, you're free.

837
00:44:31,677 --> 00:44:32,743
Psst!

838
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:48,792
- Hi.
- Good God.

839
00:44:48,793 --> 00:44:51,828
I was hoping we could touch
base about my entire future

840
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:55,699
being Hindenburged.
(SIGHS) Oh, the Romanity.

841
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,434
Come in or fuck off. This is loitering.

842
00:45:00,005 --> 00:45:02,839
You know, I'm not available
24 hours a day like an ATM.

843
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:07,177
- Did you know about Shiv?
- No.

844
00:45:07,178 --> 00:45:10,613
I mean, I didn't know-know, but...

845
00:45:10,614 --> 00:45:13,249
Anybody who wasn't a fucking
moron would've figured it out.

846
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,418
Yeah, got it. Do you have any booze.

847
00:45:15,419 --> 00:45:16,852
Here you go.

848
00:45:16,853 --> 00:45:18,654
ROMAN: Thank you.

849
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:20,022
I'm sorry.

850
00:45:21,892 --> 00:45:23,826
Thank you.

851
00:45:23,827 --> 00:45:27,462
Thanks. If you have any, uh... Mm.

852
00:45:29,967 --> 00:45:33,702
Suggestions for what I should
do for the rest of my life,

853
00:45:33,703 --> 00:45:35,071
I'm all ears.

854
00:45:35,072 --> 00:45:38,041
Well, I'm getting great reports
from the training program.

855
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:44,613
No shit! Amazing! Yes!
Fuck yeah! Training program!

856
00:45:44,614 --> 00:45:47,791
Mm! Maybe one day, I can
be in charge of making

857
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,785
the rolly-coaster go...
(IMITATES ROCKET BLAST)

858
00:45:49,786 --> 00:45:51,987
Alright, drink up because,
you know, it's bedtime.

859
00:45:51,988 --> 00:45:54,388
- Let's go.
- Okay. Mm!

860
00:45:56,793 --> 00:46:02,197
Unless you wanna schedule one
of our special conference calls

861
00:46:02,198 --> 00:46:03,965
for, say, right now?

862
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:07,301
- Excuse me?
- Hi.

863
00:46:09,372 --> 00:46:10,819
Wait, is that why you're here?

864
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,943
Mm-mm. No. I don't know.
Maybe. I don't know. No.

865
00:46:13,944 --> 00:46:15,076
Jesus Christ.

866
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:18,179
Roman, this is unacceptable.

867
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,081
This is completely inappropriate.

868
00:46:20,082 --> 00:46:21,611
- Yeah?
- What would your family say

869
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,650
if they knew you were here?

870
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:25,119
Oh, well, my family jimmy-fuck-corn,

871
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,589
- and I don't care.
- Yeah, but you do care.

872
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,123
- No.
- Yeah, I know you do.

873
00:46:29,124 --> 00:46:33,227
And they would be ashamed
of you, and rightly so.

874
00:46:33,228 --> 00:46:35,663
Okay, I'm very sorry,
Gerri how are you...

875
00:46:35,664 --> 00:46:37,832
No, you don't get to speak.

876
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:39,734
You have always been a disappointment,

877
00:46:39,735 --> 00:46:42,870
but this is just... You
have gone beyond the pale.

878
00:46:44,773 --> 00:46:46,641
- I have?
- Oh, yeah.

879
00:46:46,642 --> 00:46:48,008
You know what you are?

880
00:46:49,577 --> 00:46:51,411
What am I?

881
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:55,848
You're a sick fuck. You're
a sick fucking animal.

882
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:59,819
- Yeah?
- Yeah, don't look at me.

883
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:04,356
Get in that bathroom. Now!

884
00:47:06,394 --> 00:47:07,493
Go on.

885
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,130
And you will stay in there

886
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:12,865
until you have done
something with yourself.

887
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:21,041
You have a problem, Roman.

888
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:23,576
A revolting problem in your head.

889
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:26,245
<i>This is why you'll never
be anything but a disgrace,</i>

890
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:30,016
<i>a rotten little nothing.
Jesus Christ, you are</i>

891
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:32,384
<i>- a classic fuckup, Roman.</i>
- (ROMAN PANTING)

892
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:34,653
GERRI: <i>What are we gonna do about you?</i>

893
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:37,489
<i>What if they could see you now?</i>

894
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:40,992
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- (ROMAN MOANS)

895
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:16,219
So did anybody... Uh, anybody get
into any fun last night, or... ?

896
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,754
- Um...
- Fun?

897
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:21,358
I jerked off in Gerri's
bathroom last night.

898
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:22,692
- TABITHA: Hmm.
- Yeah.

899
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,427
- So classy of you.
- KENDALL: Morning.

900
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:27,063
It's okay. Don't worry about
it. It was actually her idea.

901
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,866
Think it really got the
old gal's juices flowing.

902
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:32,636
Even as a joke, that is
a stomach-turning thought.

903
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:34,471
(TABITHA LAUGHS)

904
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:38,775
NAN: ... about the family
dynamic of, I think he

905
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:43,379
wants to be successor.
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

906
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,814
Con. I was just getting a headcount.

907
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:47,483
Did it blow up with Maxim?

908
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:52,321
A little. But then we cracked
open a bottle of port... (LAUGHS)

909
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:56,258
- and, uh, I, um... I'm not sure.
- (LAUGHS) What happened?

910
00:49:56,259 --> 00:50:00,229
Uh... I got tipsy and I offered
him the State Department?

911
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,697
- Good?
- Yeah.

912
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:02,797
Good.

913
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:11,773
So, the family had a closed-door
meeting this morning.

914
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:16,143
- Uh-huh. Bad or good?
- I'm sorry, but, uh...

915
00:50:16,144 --> 00:50:19,347
I'm blind on this one
too. You know, I...

916
00:50:19,348 --> 00:50:23,050
I thought you'd have more time,
and I thought I could get in

917
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:26,554
and waggle the old screwdriver,
but, uh, she doesn't always

918
00:50:26,555 --> 00:50:28,623
listen to me.

919
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:32,727
- So?
- But Nan would like to meet

920
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:39,333
you, Marcia, Gerri, Shiv,
Kendall after breakfast.

921
00:50:43,405 --> 00:50:46,005
Relax. It's only life or death.

922
00:50:58,987 --> 00:51:04,257
Please, take a seat. (CLEARS THROAT)

923
00:51:06,427 --> 00:51:08,095
Is Marcia coming?

924
00:51:08,096 --> 00:51:10,998
LOGAN: Uh, she's gone for a walk.

925
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:14,601
She is a credit. A lot
of men in your station,

926
00:51:14,602 --> 00:51:18,772
they go for, uh, a certain... type.

927
00:51:20,475 --> 00:51:24,645
Anyway, we all managed
to get through an evening

928
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:27,581
pleasantly enough. That's
not why we're here, is it?

929
00:51:27,582 --> 00:51:30,484
No, it's not.

930
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:34,954
NAN: I have no illusions
about who Logan Roy is.

931
00:51:34,955 --> 00:51:37,791
Who his children are. I'm not an idiot.

932
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:40,527
Well, something has to be
done. Eight straight quarters

933
00:51:40,528 --> 00:51:44,063
of losses is a hard truth,
and we can't do good news

934
00:51:44,064 --> 00:51:46,565
- without deep pockets.
- Uh-huh.

935
00:51:48,102 --> 00:51:51,137
Call me a romantic, but I happen
to believe that the presence

936
00:51:51,138 --> 00:51:54,407
of Pierce news cameras was
what stopped certain East German

937
00:51:54,408 --> 00:51:58,010
border guards from opening fire in 1989.

938
00:51:58,011 --> 00:52:00,312
We helped take down that wall.

939
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,079
Yes.

940
00:52:02,783 --> 00:52:04,483
Commendable.

941
00:52:04,484 --> 00:52:07,285
You may not believe that, but I do.

942
00:52:08,488 --> 00:52:10,823
Now, here we are.

943
00:52:10,824 --> 00:52:15,528
On the one hand, I do
not like you very much.

944
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:18,664
And I do not like your politics.

945
00:52:18,665 --> 00:52:22,668
On the other hand, I had
a conversation this morning

946
00:52:22,669 --> 00:52:27,005
with my cousin Naomi, and
she believes that a sale

947
00:52:27,006 --> 00:52:31,442
is the only way to ensure
that Pierce Media can flourish.

948
00:52:33,145 --> 00:52:35,312
And that may be where we are.

949
00:52:38,217 --> 00:52:40,218
Rhea, what do you think?

950
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:44,722
I think... I think we're worth more.

951
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:47,659
We have made a very generous offer

952
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,627
in terms of market valuations.

953
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:52,397
- RHEA: Nevertheless.
- I don't like to be squeezed.

954
00:52:52,398 --> 00:52:55,332
- I thought we had a number.
- Uh-huh.

955
00:52:57,803 --> 00:53:01,505
Yeah. And, uh, I mean...

956
00:53:03,242 --> 00:53:04,341
Hmm.

957
00:53:06,244 --> 00:53:08,077
I could go to 25.

958
00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:11,013
But it would have to be fast.

959
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:16,387
Then, in that case...
with a certain heaviness

960
00:53:16,388 --> 00:53:20,023
of heart, if I honestly had
to say, from the family's

961
00:53:20,024 --> 00:53:21,391
point of view...

962
00:53:25,029 --> 00:53:26,095
yes.

963
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:29,600
(NAN CLEARS THROAT)

964
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:35,606
Very well. If we can clear
up our ethical concerns,

965
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:37,440
I think we can talk.

966
00:53:37,441 --> 00:53:40,076
We would like to
retain some board seats,

967
00:53:40,077 --> 00:53:44,281
and get ironclad editorial
protections in place.

968
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:46,917
I think that could be hammered out.

969
00:53:46,918 --> 00:53:49,752
- NAN: Also.
- Also.

970
00:53:49,753 --> 00:53:52,923
I think we would also
like to have a conversation

971
00:53:52,924 --> 00:53:54,857
about management.

972
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:57,860
- LOGAN: Uh-huh.
- I won't have that man

973
00:53:57,861 --> 00:54:01,798
overseeing our news. I'm
sorry. It's just not tenable.

974
00:54:01,799 --> 00:54:03,866
That won't be a problem.

975
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:09,505
NAN: More important, we would
like you to publicly announce

976
00:54:09,506 --> 00:54:10,639
a successor.

977
00:54:11,909 --> 00:54:13,208
LOGAN: Mm-hmm.

978
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:16,611
And we would like the
person you publicly announce

979
00:54:16,612 --> 00:54:18,779
to be Siobhan Roy.

980
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:22,616
LOGAN: Well...

981
00:54:24,054 --> 00:54:26,620
that's not quite how I do things.

982
00:54:27,857 --> 00:54:31,860
Well, it will have to
be, or there's no deal.

983
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:34,830
We want to announce the sale
and Shiv at the same time,

984
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:37,632
because, frankly, she may be
one of you, but she's young,

985
00:54:37,633 --> 00:54:41,770
she's a woman, and her politics
fit better with the core values

986
00:54:41,771 --> 00:54:45,772
of our family business. So...

987
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:49,343
that's the offer.

988
00:54:50,779 --> 00:54:55,148
Well, to be fair, you
don't have an offer.

989
00:54:56,785 --> 00:54:58,552
I have an offer.

990
00:54:58,553 --> 00:55:01,654
And if I announce my daughter,

991
00:55:03,192 --> 00:55:08,329
my daughter will be
announced on my time.

992
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:11,966
NAN: Okay. Let me explain something.

993
00:55:11,967 --> 00:55:15,436
- Oh, please.
- You can't put a value

994
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,803
on what we do.

00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,742
Funny. I have put a
value on what you do.

00:55:21,743 --> 00:55:28,715
Well, if you won't budge, then
I'm afraid we have no deal.

997
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:41,293
Then we're done.

998
00:55:51,172 --> 00:55:52,238
Uh...

999

1006

So, you wanna talk about it?

1007
00:57:13,487 --> 00:57:18,055

That's god-damn fucking right!

- Should we go?
- SHIV: Yeah. He won't talk.
