00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Well, we need to locate
all written information

2
00:00:01,282 --> 00:00:02,936
relevant to this investigation.

3
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,062
Are you aware of any
document destruction?

4
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:08,255
You know what? I really need to pee!

5
00:00:08,922 --> 00:00:12,211

every fucking shareholder vote.

Coochie-fucking-coo.

Yeah, I haven't seen him
like this for a while.

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,795

<i>you have options?</i>

11
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:23,420
I happen to know
there's a media operation

12
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:25,129
in need of a new CEO.

13
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,588
Uh, me? At Pierce?

KENDALL ROY: Have you seen this?

15
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:30,920
They're saying you punched him,
which caused him, in effect,

16
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:32,378
to drive his car into the river.

offer a visit to the family?</i>

you come in with me?

<i>Don't you agree?</i>

21
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:47,795
Dad? I need to ask, is it still me?

22
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:50,920
You know that I want
this, and that I can do it.

23
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:52,795
Then why are you fucking me about?

24
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:53,921
The Pierce job.

25
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,421

that was, uh, you know?

- You're a playwright.

- Yeah.

I mean, I've always told
you I'm a playwright.

Willa's talking to right now?

Rhea about the tribute videos?

- Yeah, and you know that she's...

98
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:16,629

- you're out of the game...
- no big deal.

stockpiling lentils and...

105

- and hoarding antibiotics?
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

I'm just saying it's all good, you know?

new under the sun.

me for just a moment?

been my greatest champion

00:05:58,254 --> 00:06:01,211
didn't know if... if you...
you wanted one more.

117

If it was perfect, why
would I want one more?

I just... I meant, um...

119
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:10,545
Why don't we do just one more where...

120
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:14,297
maybe you really, like, sell
how... how you're feeling?

121
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,254

that Dad's agreed

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,045
to go back to Scotland
for this dedication dinner.

131
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:37,004
- Yeah.
- CONNOR: He didn't have it easy.

132
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:38,170
Mm-hm.

133
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:39,672
He had to shit outside, right?

134
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,588
Sometimes, I think I'll
never truly understand Dad

135
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:44,879
until I shit outside.

136
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,670
I doubt that squatting
over a storm drain

137
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,170
is going to crack the case on him.

138
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:50,329
I just said, "I love you, Dad",
like ten times in a row.

139
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:52,170
I think that doubles my lifetime count.

Too steamy. Too hot.

143
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:01,795
We should all talk
about what this means...

144
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:03,504
for us, you know?

145
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:06,338

Gerri was the new thing once.

I don't know.

152
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:19,961
I just think we need to be careful.

Aw, what's wrong?

154
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:23,545
You all wedgied up because
Rhea stood on your back

155
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:25,463
and worked your arms like an elliptical?

(CONNOR AND ROMAN LAUGH)

157
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:30,670
I'm just saying, I wonder
if we should have a plan,

158
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,795
you know, in case Dad
does something rash.

159
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:34,086

Hey, Dad. It's me, Connor Roy, your son.

162
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,670
I just want to say that you've
always been my superhero, Dad.

163
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:50,547
You fight the bad guys
and you always win.

164
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:53,170
I know we don't get to spend

165
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,755
as much time together
one-on-one as we'd like,

166
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:58,713
and that makes me sad,

167
00:07:58,713 --> 00:08:01,754
but I'm unbelievably
proud to be your son.

168
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:04,504
I super love you, Super-Dad.

169

There's no plan.

I'm just encouraging us
to assess our options.

179

Okay. Is that our business?

The business with our name
on it, is it our business?

181

I don't know. If... You
know, if Dad's into it...

182
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:38,837
Like, whatever he thinks
is usually pretty on target.

183
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:41,379
Okay, well, I think Rhea is dangerous,

184
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:42,921
and I think we need to stop her.

185
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,046
Well, it... it's clear
you need to stop her.

186

All right. You know what?

We need to put feelings aside
and call a family truce,

close to the stage,

bear no legal responsibility.

starting to bubble.

He threatened to cut me off.

1061

He won't do that.

1062
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:27,588
He's too much of a fucking coward.

"What the Fuck are We
Gonna Do" committee.

1070
00:47:56,255 --> 00:47:59,295
So we made the second threat
slash offer to Mr. Weissel

1071
00:47:59,297 --> 00:48:01,420
- and he said no.
- To what?

1072
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:02,755
He said no to everything.

1073
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,338
We offered 20 million
dollars. Didn't flinch.

1074
00:48:06,338 --> 00:48:08,503
No fear of the cost of legal action.

1075
00:48:08,505 --> 00:48:09,795
Zero appetite to settle.

1076
00:48:09,797 --> 00:48:11,755
We asked for a number. Any number.

1077
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,630
- Apparently, this is no number.
- SHIV: There's no number?

1078
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,795
And there's obviously something
going on under the water.

1079
00:48:17,797 --> 00:48:19,795
- We think he has a backer?
- Who?

1080
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:22,170
Could be anyone who has
a grudge against Waystar.

1081
00:48:22,172 --> 00:48:25,755
Get a phone book. I mean,
it's a very long list.

out: the shadow logs,

- and spill his guts. Yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

1087
00:48:39,588 --> 00:48:41,211
- GERRI: Uh-huh. It's gonna be huge.
- Fuck.

1088
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:43,045
It's gonna blow wide open.

00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:44,961

00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:52,880
When... do we tell him?
Do we tell him tonight?

1093
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,170
Anyone want to end the night

1094
00:48:54,172 --> 00:48:55,503

1097
00:49:03,088 --> 00:49:04,630
(INHALES) Okay.

1098
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,045
We give him the night off.

1099
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:12,003
Let him enjoy the night.
We'll tell him tomorrow.

1100
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:13,838
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1101
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:16,003
And if I had to tell
him you made the call,

1102
00:49:16,005 --> 00:49:17,565
would you still be happy with the call?

1103
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,003
That's the call.

1104
00:49:20,005 --> 00:49:22,211
Uh... Good evening, everyone.

1105
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:24,545
