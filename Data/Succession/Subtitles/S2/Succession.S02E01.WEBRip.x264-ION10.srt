you don't wanna sell.

358
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,369
So where's my margin to tell you
something you don't wanna hear?

359
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:38,911
Well, try to think of it
as a long-term investment

360
00:20:38,993 --> 00:20:40,494
in my trust in you.

361
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:44,993
All right. In all honesty,
on the business fundamentals,

362
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,285
you should make a deal and sell.

a vicious fight.

big enough to survive.

is inflated.

Got a minute?

584
00:31:45,827 --> 00:31:46,911
Yeah.

585
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:55,035
Okay.

586
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,911
So, I don't know how much
you know or care to know,

587
00:32:01,993 --> 00:32:04,744
but your dad wanted me to offer
to talk you through things.

588
00:32:04,827 --> 00:32:05,911
Oh, okay.

589
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:07,577
So, I'll just lay it out
for you?

590
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,661
Oh, yeah, okay. I mean...

591
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,577
I don't need...

592
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:13,827
Yeah? Well, shall I,
just so you know?

593
00:32:15,327 --> 00:32:18,786
So, the site of the crash was
discovered around 4:00 a.m.

594
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,744
by two of our guys who saw
the busted fence

595
00:32:20,827 --> 00:32:22,619
-and followed that up.
-Uh-huh.

596
00:32:22,702 --> 00:32:24,327
And they informed local police.

597
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,827
And as you know,

598
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:28,035
an entry keycard was found
and passed to me.

599
00:32:28,118 --> 00:32:30,661
So, that's one individual
outside of our loop,

600
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:33,077
but who is known to me
and who I consider secure.

601
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,410
Okay.

602
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,118
And the UK police
sent divers in that morning.

603
00:32:36,202 --> 00:32:37,702
KENDALL: Right. Right.

604
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:39,952
And the kid, uh, Andrew Dodds,
well, he was dead obviously.

605
00:32:40,035 --> 00:32:42,410
He'd unclipped his seatbelt,
so he had survived the impact

606
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:43,702
to do that.

607
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:45,369
Oh, okay.

608
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:47,827
So, the initial determination
was that he was travelling solo

609
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:49,327
and that hasn't been challenged.

610
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,619
And the riverbank was also
heavily compromised

611
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:54,035
by rain and our guys
and the salvage operation,

612
00:32:54,118 --> 00:32:57,160
so there were no indicators
of another individual.

613
00:32:58,285 --> 00:32:59,952
So, that's where we are.

614
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:02,535
We expect the UK coroner
to deliver a ruling

615
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:03,993
of death by misadventure,

616
00:33:04,077 --> 00:33:06,285
and that will be it
as far as we see.

617
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:08,202
Any questions or concerns?

618
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:14,327
Um... I do not think so, no.

619
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,535
Thank you, Colin.

00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,744

It may kill the bid,
it may not.

00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:51,160

that's been put to me is

714
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:53,786
do we really want this fight?

00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:59,285

and fuck off out of the casino?

Because if we do fight,

We make video games consoles.
Hm? Why?

859
00:46:26,035 --> 00:46:28,077
(CHUCKLING) We make indie
fucking movies! Why?

860
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
Do we get a theme park ride
out of it?

861
00:46:30,243 --> 00:46:32,118
No? We have an arm

862
00:46:32,202 --> 00:46:35,410
that launches fucking telecoms
satellites that blow up.

863
00:46:35,494 --> 00:46:39,702
No. Restructure for the future.
Maybe merge with a distributor,

864
00:46:39,786 --> 00:46:44,702
expand parks, expand cruises,
lose news. Paper and TV.

865
00:46:44,786 --> 00:46:48,661
News is trouble. Ten new parks
in China, Russia, Middle East.

866
00:46:48,744 --> 00:46:50,952
You don't need the feedback
from fucking news.

867
00:46:51,035 --> 00:46:52,452
Right.

868
00:46:52,535 --> 00:46:54,160
But you haven't really
thought about it?

869
00:46:54,243 --> 00:46:55,993
Well, those are just
the obvious moves.

870
00:46:56,077 --> 00:46:59,702
Well obviously, I always wanted
one of you kids to take over.

871
00:47:00,702 --> 00:47:02,285
Uh-huh.

872
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:04,035
Well, what about it?

873
00:47:04,118 --> 00:47:07,118
(SCOFFS) Yeah, we've done that.
What about Tom?

874
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:08,369
(SIGHS)

875
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:10,952
So.

876
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:13,285
No?

877
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,911
If I keep going, if we fight...

878
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,327
I have to name Kendall.

879
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,160
Yeah. Yeah, I see what this is.
I see it.

880
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:26,993
You know, I fucking see it.
You've done a little dirty deal.

881
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:30,327
What, so, you keep Kendall on
to kill the bid and then he...

882
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,160
he takes over
when you step down in a year?

883
00:47:32,243 --> 00:47:36,160
What a squalid little fucking
backroom deal.

884
00:47:36,243 --> 00:47:38,577
-He blackmailed you, didn't he?
-LOGAN: Oh, Shiv.

885
00:47:38,661 --> 00:47:41,911
No. No! I-- I--
If he takes over,

886
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:45,452
I'll sell my shares. Yeah,
I'll join Sandy and Stewy.

887
00:47:45,535 --> 00:47:47,993
I'll get Gil to go for you.

888
00:47:48,077 --> 00:47:50,744
I-- I-- I mean, I'll kill him.
I'll fucking kill him!

889
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:53,077
Shiv, why so angry?

890
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,452
I-- I haven't done a deal
with Kendall.

891
00:47:56,243 --> 00:47:57,494
I do what I want.

892
00:47:57,577 --> 00:47:58,702
SHIV: Mm-hmm.

893
00:47:58,786 --> 00:48:00,661
And what I've decided
I'd like to do

894
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:04,619
is to formally ask you
to come in

895
00:48:04,702 --> 00:48:07,619
and be the next chief executive
of this company.

896
00:48:11,077 --> 00:48:12,619
I don't think
I'm the right person.

897
00:48:12,702 --> 00:48:15,118
Well, you know, I'm pretty smart
and I think you are.

898
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:17,619
You are, Shiv.

899
00:48:21,035 --> 00:48:22,118
You're the one.

900
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:29,744
SHIV: Are we actually
having this conversation?

901
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:31,993
Yes, we are actually having
this conversation.

902
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:35,285
And selling? Yeah? That's--
What is that? Is that real?

903
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:37,494
Of course.
If you don't come in, yeah.

904
00:48:37,577 --> 00:48:40,410
I mean, Roman? No.

905
00:48:40,494 --> 00:48:44,160
Connor? Ha!
I might as well sell, right?

906
00:48:44,243 --> 00:48:45,452
SHIV: (SNICKERS) Dad!

907
00:48:45,535 --> 00:48:46,869
You know,
I didn't build all this up

908
00:48:46,952 --> 00:48:49,202
to have some fucking
rockstar CEO

909
00:48:49,285 --> 00:48:50,786
waltz in and take over.

910
00:48:51,661 --> 00:48:53,327
Dad, I don't think so.

911
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:56,285
Really? Because if there's
really no hope

912
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:59,786
of you coming in,
I'd rather cash out.

913
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:02,535
Look, if this is the way we're
having this conversation anyway,

914
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:04,327
then yeah, fine, sell.

915
00:49:05,077 --> 00:49:07,118
Fine, I'll do it.

916
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:09,285
Right now.

917
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:17,993
I'll tweet, the markets
will move, and that'll be that.

918
00:49:18,744 --> 00:49:19,786
Bullshit.

919
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:21,993
You don't care if I sell?

920
00:49:25,243 --> 00:49:27,369
Don't be a fucking jerk, Dad.

921
00:49:29,285 --> 00:49:30,494
You wanna do it?

922
00:49:31,786 --> 00:49:32,869
(SHIV SIGHS)

923
00:49:36,661 --> 00:49:37,702
Yes.

924
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:43,285
Yes, of course, I'd
be interested. If it's real.

925
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:44,494
This is real.

926
00:49:44,577 --> 00:49:47,535
Yes, of course.
Dad, I can do it.

927
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:51,911
I could-- I would...

928
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:56,285
Why did you never ask me,
huh?

929
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,619
I would kill this.
I'd fucking destroy it!

930
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:01,952
Yes.

931
00:50:03,786 --> 00:50:05,410
This is wonderful, Siobhan.

932
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,535
This is real?

933
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:11,661
This is real.

934
00:50:11,744 --> 00:50:14,911
Remember this,
this slant of light.

935
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:16,952
Remember this.

936
00:50:18,577 --> 00:50:19,619
This is it.

937
00:50:31,786 --> 00:50:33,702
Well, we're gonna need
to talk about it.

938
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:40,035
For now, we need to keep this
between us.

939
00:50:40,118 --> 00:50:41,786
I gotta think about Tom,
Gil...

940
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:44,952
Of course. We have to think
about the choreography anyway.

941
00:50:45,035 --> 00:50:47,869
I mean, get you up to speed,
you know, fast track you.

942
00:50:47,952 --> 00:50:50,410
And as soon as you have
the experience...

943
00:50:51,952 --> 00:50:53,077
we name you.

944
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:54,535
Yes?

945
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,118
(LAUGHING) Yes!

946
00:50:57,202 --> 00:50:58,369
Fuck.

947
00:50:58,452 --> 00:51:00,494
Yes. All right.

948
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,243
Yes.

949
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,369
Ha!

950
00:51:05,452 --> 00:51:06,577
What?

951
00:51:06,661 --> 00:51:08,327
Ah, it's just my dealer.

952
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:09,452
Viagra?

953
00:51:10,327 --> 00:51:11,702
CONNOR: Antiquities.

954
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:14,661
Um, there's a package of
items my bidder is in for.

955
00:51:15,786 --> 00:51:16,827
Ah, hell, why not.

956
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:19,035
-TOM: Like what?
-Uh, Napoleonica.

957
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,369
Just some items.

958
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,535
In-- Including Napoleon's
penis.

959
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,619
That's not the central item.

960
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:26,535
It's... just a package,

961
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:29,285
with some letters and some
other artifacts, but yes,

962
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:30,369
that has come to market.

963
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:31,744
TOM: Napoleon's penis?

964
00:51:31,827 --> 00:51:34,285
CONNOR: Mm. It's obviously
not an item of interest

965
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:37,035
to serious scholars,
but as a curio, sure.

966
00:51:37,118 --> 00:51:38,786
A British surgeon
snipped it off.

967
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:42,202
(LAUGHS) Connor's trying to buy
Napoleon's dick.

968
00:51:42,285 --> 00:51:45,911
Hmm. Naturally.
Is it pickled in a jar, or...?

969
00:51:45,993 --> 00:51:48,952
It's dried. Yeah, really not
much to see nowadays.

970
00:51:49,035 --> 00:51:51,869
Yeah, it's kinda like, what,
like a strip of beef jerky?

971
00:51:51,952 --> 00:51:54,452
Yeah, it's a mere trifle,
historically speaking.

972
00:51:54,535 --> 00:51:57,619
So, what are you gonna do?
Get that and Hitler's nutsack?

973
00:51:57,702 --> 00:52:00,535
Blend it into
a take-over-Europe smoothie?

974
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:01,786
Hey, how'd it go?

975
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,243
Yeah, cool.
He offered me the company.

976
00:52:04,327 --> 00:52:05,702
I told him to, uh,

977
00:52:05,786 --> 00:52:08,118
send you to look at pineapple
production in Honduras.

978
00:52:08,202 --> 00:52:10,619
Hey. So? How'd it go?
What did he say?

979
00:52:10,702 --> 00:52:11,744
-Uh, yes.
-Where am I going?

980
00:52:11,827 --> 00:52:14,452
-How's the plan?
-Lot of options.

981
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:16,327
(LAUGHS) Jesus, Shiv!

982
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:18,494
What have you fucking landed
me? Is it huge?

983
00:52:18,577 --> 00:52:20,327
Yeah. No, I had some leverage.

984
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,619
-Yeah?
-And, uh...

985
00:52:21,702 --> 00:52:24,035
I got you into the belly
of the beast.

986
00:52:26,202 --> 00:52:29,827
Chair of Global Broadcast News.
ATN, baby.

987
00:52:30,285 --> 00:52:31,577
Shit.

988
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:36,619
Holy shit! (CHUCKLING)
Oh, my God!

989
00:52:36,702 --> 00:52:38,869
Wait, is there a--
What about-- What's, uh--

990
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:40,786
Does it fit with Cyd, Peach?

991
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:41,952
Is that an overlap?

992
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:43,952
-Yeah, no. Dad likes that.
-Okay.

993
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,327
You know, two contenders,
one chair, that's his favorite.

994
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:48,535
-It's an invitation to step up.
-Whoa.

995
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:49,993
You gotta eat the Peach, baby!

996
00:52:50,077 --> 00:52:53,327
-Fuck! Global Broadcast News.
-Mm-hmm.

997
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:54,827
-Wow.
-Yeah.

998
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,243
So, what did you--
What did you say?

999
00:52:56,327 --> 00:52:57,661
Is he not s--
He's not selling?

1000
00:52:57,744 --> 00:52:59,118
Did he offer you more stock?

1001
00:52:59,202 --> 00:53:02,661
No, he, uh...
Bunch of mind games.

1002
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:03,577
Okay.

1003
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:05,452
Um, you know, classic Dad.

1004
00:53:05,535 --> 00:53:06,744
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

1005
00:53:10,118 --> 00:53:11,243
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

1006
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:16,410
-Afternoon.
-Afternoon.

1007
00:53:17,035 --> 00:53:18,160
So?

1008
00:53:18,243 --> 00:53:19,452
What is it?

1009
00:53:19,535 --> 00:53:20,744
I see you.

1010
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:22,619
Sir?

1011
00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:24,118
We spoke on the telephone,
isn't that right?

1012
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,494
Yes.

1013
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,035
You were chiseling me a little,
on the stable works.

1014
00:53:27,118 --> 00:53:28,535
Rich old fucking guy!

1015
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:31,369
We'll pad it 30 percent,
cream for the fucking cat.

1016
00:53:31,452 --> 00:53:33,243
No, sir, it was a time
and material job straight up.

1017
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:35,993
So you got a bit disappointed
when I set a 200K ceiling

1018
00:53:36,077 --> 00:53:39,494
so you stuffed a fucking bag
of live raccoons

1019
00:53:39,577 --> 00:53:41,535
-to rot in my chimney?
-No, sir.

1020
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,452
"No, sir, no, sir,
three bags full, sir."

1021
00:53:43,535 --> 00:53:45,786
Fuck off! Look at me.

1022
00:53:49,577 --> 00:53:52,535
No, sir. Don't know about that.

1023
00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:55,661
Yeah? Well, I'll pay you
100 grand all in

1024
00:53:55,744 --> 00:53:57,202
and we're done.

1025
00:53:57,285 --> 00:53:59,202
That-- That that won't even
cover the materials, sir.

1026
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:00,535
I can't do that.

1027
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:03,369
Try to stink me out?
I won't fucking have it!

1028
00:54:03,452 --> 00:54:06,786
That was a 300-grand job, sir.
That was the price--

is there any way through this,

Right, then, uh,
he wanted me to tell you

1139
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,993
to say, yeah, obviously
our public line will be

1140
01:00:20,077 --> 01:00:21,494
that we are considering
the offer

1141

but it doesn't matter
what you offer;

1142
01:00:23,035 --> 01:00:25,202
he'll never recommend this
to the board.

but if you don't,
he aims to kill you.

or go to jail

1148

before he lets you beat him.

1149
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:38,202
He will kill you on the business
and if that doesn't work,

1150
01:00:38,285 --> 01:00:39,952
he will send people around.

1151

01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:51,744
for the discussion he has
with his kids

1197
01:03:51,827 --> 01:03:52,911
in a frank way.

1198
01:03:52,993 --> 01:03:54,661
Or if he's loading the dice.

1199
01:03:55,243 --> 01:03:57,202
Please,
I want you to speak freely.

1200
01:03:57,577 --> 01:03:58,744
(SIGHS) Anything you say

1201
01:03:58,827 --> 01:04:00,827
can and will be used against you
in a court of law? Like?

1202
01:04:00,911 --> 01:04:02,160
Come on, we're all pals here.

1203
01:04:02,243 --> 01:04:03,869
-SHIV ROY: Oh, yeah.
-Let's fucking have it out.

1204
01:04:03,952 --> 01:04:07,911
I fucking love money,
but I'm really scared of you.

1205
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:09,661
-So...
-Mm.

1206
01:04:10,077 --> 01:04:12,160
ARMSTRONG:
Logan wants a family legacy.

1207
01:04:12,243 --> 01:04:14,619
When he looks at Roman, I don't
think he sees it there tomorrow.

1208
01:04:14,702 --> 01:04:17,369
And his son has
both betrayed him

1209
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:21,118
and also been in circumstances
which make him seem

1210
01:04:21,202 --> 01:04:22,827
like not a good candidate
right now.

1211
01:04:23,035 --> 01:04:24,827
And Connor,
I think he would laugh about.

1212
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:28,410
So Shiv feels like, "Well that's
what he's gonna do, right?"

1213
01:04:28,494 --> 01:04:29,827
It seemed obvious to us.

1214
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:31,869
What I've decided
I'd like to do,

1215
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,160
is to formally ask you

1216
01:04:34,786 --> 01:04:35,786
to come in...

1217
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:39,077
and be the next chief executive
of this company.

1218
01:04:39,702 --> 01:04:43,786
It nearly made my cry seeing
Shiv sort of finally say

1219
01:04:43,869 --> 01:04:44,993
what she has always wanted.

1220
01:04:45,202 --> 01:04:47,494
I think there's some things
in life that you don't

1221
01:04:47,744 --> 01:04:50,869
almost even know you want
until you say it.

1222
01:04:50,952 --> 01:04:53,243
And then it can be
quite powerful and overwhelming,

1223
01:04:53,327 --> 01:04:54,911
the acceptance of it.

1224
01:04:54,993 --> 01:04:56,160
You wanna do it?

1225
01:04:56,952 --> 01:04:59,410
-Yes?
-(GIGGLING) Yes!

1226
01:05:00,452 --> 01:05:01,452
Fuck!

1227
01:05:03,035 --> 01:05:04,118
All right.

1228
01:05:05,452 --> 01:05:06,369
Yes.

1229
01:05:06,452 --> 01:05:08,993
