To be next.

I thought that it was something
that we wanted

4
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:11,571
for me, to have it.

5
00:00:11,654 --> 00:00:13,487
Me is just a modification
of the plan.

6
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:15,028
That's q--
quite a big modification.

00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:21,404
to Tom, ATN, are a distraction.

9
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:22,737
Well you know what, I'm out.

10
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:25,195
I needed a place in the city
because I'm still applying

11

There's no time like

You can't say I said anything.

But you did.

62

Look, Greg, if you want this
to be anonymous,

63
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:27,862
you have to say that
from the outset.

64
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:29,571
You can't do that retroactively.

65
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:32,404
But no, because
this isn't a meeting.

-Look...

67

-That's not fair. That's unfair.
-Greg,

68
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:37,446
I am writing this biography.

69
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:41,070

70
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:43,362
-Mm-hmm.
-And I really have no doubt

71
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:45,903
that you have been to
a bunch of meetings,

72
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:49,070
and you have done
a bunch of things.

73
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:51,237
So, my question is:

74
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:56,862
Do you want to present
your side,

75
00:02:56,945 --> 00:03:00,862
or are you happy for everyone
else to tell their version?

-Mm-hmm.
-Connor...

519
00:23:57,571 --> 00:23:59,737
You know what they do
to rich people in jail.

520
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,404
Yes, they let them out early

521
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,903
to mitigate the risk
of litigation.

522
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:06,487
Going to jail
is not a good look.

523
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:09,028

524

The old shibboleths
are crumbling.

526
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
And you know what?
The elites are scared.

527
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:17,571
I can see 'em down there,

528
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:20,820
a-scrabbling and reconfiguring,

529
00:24:20,903 --> 00:24:25,737
with no clue what the whirlwind
they have stirred heralds.

530
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,195
Do you think that maybe
if you're looking down

531
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:30,529
on the elites from, like,
you know, this penthouse,

532
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:32,070
maybe it's indicative
of something?

533
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:34,696
Smart.

534
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:36,903
My baby sister is smart, right?

-She is. Hey.
-SHIV: Hi.

536
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,070
-How are you?
-Uh, yeah. Connor,

537
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:44,612
don't release the video.
Okay? Please?

538
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:47,362
(SIGHS) Why?

you're gonna humiliate us,

00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:52,279

-Yeah.

542
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,154
Dad wants to stop me.

543
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:59,571
Well, tell him to get in line
behind Bezos and the Clintons.

544
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:02,237
Connor, I'm asking a favor.

545
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,487
Please.

546
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:06,903
Well, how about I make
counter-offer?

547
00:25:06,987 --> 00:25:10,446
I'd like to make a rather
indecent proposal.

548
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:13,154

you haven't seen that film.

549

Ooh. He has. Yeah,
it's his favorite.

550
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:17,612
I happen to know
you're at a loose end.

551
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:20,237
Shiv, come and work for me.

552
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:23,320
Hmm? What? No.

553
00:25:23,404 --> 00:25:25,154
(LAUGHS) No. No.

554
00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:27,028
It's a big offer. Big.

555
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:29,320
Big offer, Shiv.
You'd run the whole shebang.

556
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,654
And look, if Gil fired you,
maybe you're, um,

557
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:33,778
-a difficult hire right now.
-He didn't fire me.

558

-I walked out.
-Okay.

-I-- I--
-No. Okay.

560
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,571
So what would it take
for you to change your mind?

561
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:41,112
-A lobotomy.

Work at a slaughterhouse.

What the fuck is his obsession
with milk?

1208

Kittens and perverts.

Pierce's CEO,

1211

emailed saying she heard
about your approach.

1212
00:56:38,654 --> 00:56:40,279
She can help us.

1213
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:44,237
So... can you bring me
her head on a platter?

1214
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,612
I can bring you her head

How was it?

It was pretty, uh...

-pretty tough... actually, yeah.
-Yeah?

1224
00:57:18,446 --> 00:57:19,571
Anybody fill you in?

1225
00:57:19,654 --> 00:57:22,612
Uh, no. Wh-- What happened?

1226
00:57:22,696 --> 00:57:27,778
Um, your dad was a little
peppery.

1227
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,446
Oh. I'm sorry, Tom.

1228
00:57:31,529 --> 00:57:35,612
Maybe it wasn't totally great
what you sent me to do.

1229
00:57:35,696 --> 00:57:39,237
Which is kind of the opposite
of what I wanted to do.

1230
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,446
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1231

-Yeah.

But I-- I don't wanna be a dick,

1234
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,571
but maybe I should
have a bit more input

1235
00:57:51,654 --> 00:57:53,028
into team tactics.

1236
00:57:54,612 --> 00:57:56,237
Yeah. Sure.
Of course.
