00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,103
- Uh-huh.
- Former cruise employee,

3
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,743
James Wiesel in accounting,

4
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:08,201
seems to have gotten spooked. And...

5
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:10,136
seems like he might be about to talk.

6
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:11,537
I thought we had this all sewn up.

7
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:14,618
- I said I'd hoped.
- Don't... Interrupt me.

8
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:17,284
Have you talked to your
dad about a major injection

9
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:19,794
or even taking us private?

10
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:21,826
It's a conversation we can have.

11
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:24,743
To Bill, the best boss that ever lived.

12
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:27,987
So I'm gonna create a
word document for you,

13
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,868
and then I'm gonna print it
because I don't want anything

14

15
00:00:32,243 --> 00:00:35,068
I think Rhea is dangerous, and
I think we need to stop her.

We need to put feelings
aside and call a family truce.

18
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:40,868

get ripped to shreds."

20
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:46,559

Rhea. Have I got her right?

00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560

Okay, uh... Dave? Uh...
Dave... just walked out.

- Dave just walked out.
- Yes. We'll go with them now.

Okay. Can I just ask what
this is in regards to?

it... It's a business thing?

- Uh-huh.
- Okay, and my security guy,

508
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:37,451
Dave, he just walked out.
Can I ask where Dave went?

- Oh, Dave's not coming.
- Yeah. Uh...

Um... I... I... I would actually
really like for Dave to come.

Uh... There's a concern about Dave.

we're better with these guys.

Mr. Wambsgans, I hope
I'm saying that correctly.

528
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,992
Just some background.
Mr. Lester McClintock.

529
00:26:26,993 --> 00:26:28,868
You accept he offered jobs

530
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:31,743

531
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:34,159
Uh... That does seem to be the case.

532
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,368
Um... But the... the company,
uh, wasn't aware,

533
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:41,326
and obviously, that was some
time before my time, um...

But within the upper echelons
of the firm and the family,

537
00:26:48,786 --> 00:26:54,660
Lester was commonly known
as Mo. Is that correct?

00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:59,201
I... I don't... I don't...
I... I'm a relative newcomer.

This email, you call
Lester McClintock "Mo." Why?

540
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,201
I... I guess I think
it was just a nickname.

541
00:27:09,202 --> 00:27:14,056
EAVIS: Mm-hm. You call him
"Mo" over 30 times in emails

542
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:17,159
to family and colleagues,
but you never use it

543
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,031
in the items of correspondence
sent to him privately,

544
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:24,035
for instance, during
his illness. Why not?

545
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:31,368
- Senator, I don't know.
- EAVIS: You don't know?

546
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:34,660
He was called Mo, but
always behind his back.

have to look at the emails,

Mo. Mo Lester. Molester.

552
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:58,992

EAVIS: <i>Well, you were right there.</i>

554
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:04,368
But just because we... he
was called, um, Mo Lester,

555
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:05,910

556
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:08,451

That was 100 percent based on truth.

559
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:15,910
But of all the many, many people
who called this molester...

560
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:20,868
"Mo Lester", not one of
them had the slightest idea

561
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,076
that he actually was a molester.

562
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,076

that stretches our credulity.

they were apparently unavailable

to take closer control
of some key assets.

834
00:40:42,702 --> 00:40:46,159
It's anti-corruption,
but a bit of a power grab.

835
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,493
Some Turkish acquiescence,

And can I ask, not to
make this all about us,

837
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,992

shoot us at any point?

838
00:40:57,993 --> 00:41:00,493

So, one query they
wanted some clarity on was

844
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,534
how could we... how could
they be sure their investment

845
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:24,368
wouldn't be blocked by your government?

846
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:30,284

That is not a problem at
all. If the price is right,

What this feels to me it's about

929

is your personal dislike of my father,

930
00:46:04,702 --> 00:46:09,368

hatred of his newspapers

931
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:12,117

and in particular,

932
00:46:12,118 --> 00:46:16,618

00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:28,660

00:49:37,744 --> 00:49:39,826
And I'm gonna be very frank with you,

998
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:43,369
put my cards on the table,
I don't trust him. Okay?

999
00:49:45,494 --> 00:49:47,076
Your firm has been very tough.

1000
00:49:47,077 --> 00:49:48,369
Yeah, too fucking right.

1001
00:49:49,577 --> 00:49:51,534
- Harassment?
- Yeah.

1002
00:49:51,535 --> 00:49:54,785
Visits at night, turning up at work.

1003
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:59,701
Weird email stuff. I mean, I...
I... don't want to accuse you...

1004
00:49:59,702 --> 00:50:02,701
No, it's perfectly possible.

1005
00:50:02,702 --> 00:50:04,493
Yeah, I mean, it's
out-sourced security,

1006
00:50:04,494 --> 00:50:06,576
so who... (CHUCKLES) Who
knows what could be happening?

1007
00:50:06,577 --> 00:50:08,159
It's probably worse than you think.

1008
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,284
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1009
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:12,618
But hey, you should be
safe from all that now.

1010
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:15,159
You've got the whip hand.
Now, they're scared.

1011
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,242
I don't think that stuff
will happen to you anymore.

1012
00:50:17,243 --> 00:50:18,576
You don't think?

1013
00:50:18,577 --> 00:50:20,243
Being honest, I don't know.

1014
00:50:21,243 --> 00:50:23,743
But... it would look bad.

1015
00:50:23,744 --> 00:50:26,409
You've broken ranks,
you're in a new category.

1016
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:27,868
Uh-huh.

1017
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:30,744
But, look... I wanna clean up.

1018
00:50:31,452 --> 00:50:32,701
I need it all out there.

1019
00:50:32,702 --> 00:50:34,701
- Sure. (CHUCKLES)
- Yeah, no, I do.

1020
00:50:34,702 --> 00:50:38,452
I wanna fire these bastards.
And I want you to help me.

1021
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,451
Sure.

1022
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:42,995
Well, I guess, you know,

1023
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:45,992
the only question I would
have for you is just...

1024
00:50:45,993 --> 00:50:50,743
is this... this, you know,
the... the right forum?

1025
00:50:50,744 --> 00:50:52,660
Okay, here it comes.

1026
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:55,285
Nope, honestly? A better question.

1027
00:50:57,118 --> 00:51:00,743
What do you actually want to happen?

1028
00:51:00,744 --> 00:51:03,910
I want people to hear
what Lester was like.

1029
00:51:03,911 --> 00:51:06,868
How he treated me and other women.

1030
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:09,034
I want the Hewson story to come out.

1031
00:51:09,035 --> 00:51:12,951
How she went overboard... and
there was no rescue attempt,

1032
00:51:12,952 --> 00:51:15,077
because they thought it was a stowaway.

1033
00:51:15,952 --> 00:51:17,619
"No real person involved."

1034
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:19,619
Right.

1035
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:24,661
Hey, you want to sit down?

1036
00:51:26,827 --> 00:51:27,950
I mean, the good thing is,

1037
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,159
you're gonna have a lot
of people on your side.

1038
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,202
Who will... Who will sing your
name, and back you up, and...

1039
00:51:35,494 --> 00:51:38,034
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

1040
00:51:38,035 --> 00:51:41,451
But the other people?
You know, the other side?

1041
00:51:41,452 --> 00:51:44,786
Normal people, they will doubt you.

1042
00:51:45,993 --> 00:51:48,494
They'll say... terrible things.

1043
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:50,661
They'll call you a slut...

1044
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:54,951
and a whore, and a money-grubber.

1045
00:51:54,952 --> 00:51:57,034
Your life is gonna get ripped apart.

1046
00:51:57,035 --> 00:51:59,576
Your home, you'll want to move out.

1047
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:02,242
For two or three days, you're
gonna be kind of famous,

1048
00:52:02,243 --> 00:52:04,826
but then the caravan moves on.

1049
00:52:04,827 --> 00:52:06,744
I just think it's what I have to do.

1050
00:52:08,243 --> 00:52:12,117
Yeah, true. No, I get it. That's good.

1051
00:52:12,118 --> 00:52:16,951
But from tomorrow,
that's... all you'll ever be.

1052
00:52:16,952 --> 00:52:20,284
To your grandkids, to the
people you meet on vacation.

1053
00:52:20,285 --> 00:52:22,117
When they google you, yeah?

1054
00:52:22,118 --> 00:52:25,701
Pages and pages of filth and lies.

1055
00:52:25,702 --> 00:52:28,702
First line of your obituary. Last line.

1056
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:30,702
Uh-huh.

1057
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:35,869
So, what is it that
you are trying to get?

1058
00:52:37,827 --> 00:52:41,618
Because money? Money you can have.

1059
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:46,284
That's easy. Book deal.
Interview appearances.

1060
00:52:46,285 --> 00:52:48,951
We will give you millions of dollars...

1061
00:52:48,952 --> 00:52:52,410
and I will destroy the men
who ran that dirty operation.

1062
00:52:53,494 --> 00:52:55,910
I will kill them for what they've done.

1063
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:58,242
And I want you to help me.

1064
00:52:58,243 --> 00:53:01,910
We will be the best, cleanest
operation in the world

1065
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:05,243
because of you, if you help me do this.

1066
00:53:07,494 --> 00:53:08,744
Would you help me?

1067
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:13,410
Well, it... it sounds...

1068
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:17,535
Can I trust you?

1069
00:53:19,202 --> 00:53:22,117
No. No, actually, no.

1070
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:25,201
Kira, you're in a shitstorm
of conflicting interests here.

1071
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:29,660
You can't trust anyone.
You just have to be smart.

1072
00:53:29,661 --> 00:53:31,785
So, listen to everyone
and make an assessment.

1073
00:53:31,786 --> 00:53:35,327
'Cause frankly, I want
what's best for me.

1074
00:53:36,118 --> 00:53:37,534
But the other people?

1075
00:53:37,535 --> 00:53:39,409
The folks who want you
to get up there tomorrow,

1076
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:42,494
and get pulled apart? They
want what's best for them.

1077
00:53:44,118 --> 00:53:46,619
You need to think about
what's best for you, huh?

- Hey. Hey!

Uh... I don't know. I
feel like, traditionally,

1088
00:54:18,577 --> 00:54:20,660
Americans don't usually
fare well at this point.

1089
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:22,159
I don't know, what do you think, Karl?

1090
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,951
- KARL: Oh, fuck.
- LAIRD: Just do what he says.

1091
00:54:23,952 --> 00:54:25,992
Yeah, okay. Um...

1092
00:54:25,993 --> 00:54:28,034
- Roman Roy?
- Yup.

1093
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,285
Follow me, please.

1094
00:54:30,577 --> 00:54:32,869
- EDUARD: Good luck.
- Yeah. Uh...

1095
00:54:34,285 --> 00:54:35,951
Good luck to you, too.

1096
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:38,452
- Go, Hi... Hearts.
- Go, Hearts.

1097
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:45,826
Anyway, thank you for your support.

Are you kidding? So many memories, huh?

1110
00:55:14,035 --> 00:55:18,534
I should write a book. I
could. I've got the diaries.

But no time. No time! (CHUCKLES)

We're good. It's all good.

No, I wouldn't say he was a friend, no.

1142
00:57:05,786 --> 00:57:08,035
You once told me he was a close friend.

1143

- You told me that.
- Well...

1144

Friend, close friend,
colleague, I don't know.

I mean, I know you're lying,

1148
00:57:22,577 --> 00:57:25,160
but I still find you very
plausible and appealing.

1149
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,618
I misspoke.

and I just wanted to protect you.

- I don't need your protection.
- Well, you know, as the next CEO,

it might be wise to keep

00:57:46,577 --> 00:57:48,327
I've been thinking about that.

1158
00:57:53,952 --> 00:57:55,117
So, what do you want?

1159
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:56,785
I'm not sure I want to work for you.

1160
00:57:56,786 --> 00:57:58,660
Fine, you've got me over a barrel.

1161
