00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:37,219
- GREG: Oh, yeah.
- Uh, I don't want a bump in.

174
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,551
- Not here, not now.
- TOM: Okay.

175
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,019
Vipers would love it.

176
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,089
GREG: Gladly... We'd be honored
to be your talking partners...

177
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,326
So, basically, the
talk is a celebration of

178
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,661
putting audience input front and center.

179
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,137
And hopefully be really inclusive

180
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:52,332
and quite changey after recent events,

181
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,101
because ATN Citizen is essentially

182
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,770
very similar but with the option of...

183
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,605
How's he... How's he looking?

184
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,940
Is he healthy?

185
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,508
- GREG: Uh...
- He looks...

186
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,879
- GREG: Not really.
- He looks a little enfeebled.

187
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,180
- Yeah.
- TOM: I'd say.

188
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:10,515
I heard... I heard, maybe...

189
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,885
maybe syphilis?

190
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,519
- Whoa.
- What? Really?

191
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,388
- Interesting.
- And that's definitely...

192
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,758
You don't really hear much
about syphilis these days.

193
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,295
Very much the, uh...
the MySpace of STDs.

194
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,397
Excuse me, Logan.

195
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,632
I, uh, just spoke to Karolina.

196
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,800
It came through.

197
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,503
They're asking for a response.

198
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,572
Get a room. But slow. No ripples.

199
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,184
A room?

200
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:51,890
Sorry. Uh, the magazine
contacted Cruises directly.

201
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,391
- Who at Cruises?
- Hello?

202
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,559
Just Florida PR.

203
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,661
Obviously, they thought
they could get someone

204
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,963
who might spew if they
went low on the food chain,

205
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:00,665
but I had 'em all briefed.

206
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,634
What have they got?
How much have they got?

207
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,807
We don't know.

208
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:06,070
All they're requesting is
a response on one element.

209
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:08,807
- Karolina said we had two weeks.
- HUGO BAKER: (SCOFFS) Yeah.

210
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,743
Well, I don't know where
Karolina got that from,

211
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,176
so, I... I cannot speak to that.

212
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:15,079
Uh, so I have Shiv on
the line, if that's, um...

213
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,213
Uh-huh.

214
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:17,682
Shiv, you're on speaker.

215
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,445
SHIV: <i>So, what the fuck is going on?</i>

216
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:22,052
I hear there's a big muck-rake
piece coming in on Cruises?

217
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:24,220
- KENDALL: Yeah, that's right.
- SHIV:<i> So, what's in it?</i>

218
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:25,556
HUGO: Uh, we don't know exactly.

219
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,023
SHIV: <i>I'm sorry, who is this?</i>

220
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:29,225
Uh, Hugo Baker, Senior
Vice President Comms

221
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:30,527
for Parks and Cruises.

222
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:32,529
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Wait. Is Dad there?

223
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,931
Does he know I'm on this call?

224
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,966
- I'm here.
- SHIV:<i> Okay, so,</i>

225
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,768
tell me again, how...
how did this happen?

226
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,171
GERRI KELLMAN: <i>Oh, well, we
had a tip off some time ago.</i>

227
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,106
<i>New York Magazine</i>
working on a substantial piece.

228
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:46,276
They're, um, only giving
us limited allegations

229
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:47,563
and asking for a response.

230
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,179
Okay, so there's a bomb about to go off,

231
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,486
and do we know what the fuck is in it?

232
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:53,083
Why do you do this, Dad?
Why do you hoard information?

233
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:55,217
What you don't know can't hurt you.

234
00:10:55,218 --> 00:10:58,053
Obviously, uh, we are
confident on our position,

235
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,254
regardless of the allegations.

236
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:01,757
KENDALL: <i>And, uh, this'll drop when?</i>

237
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:03,158
HUGO:<i> Well, online first,</i>

238
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:06,195
thirty-six to forty-eight hours.
Um, so, yeah. Not two weeks.

239
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:08,297
Again, I've no idea
where that came from.

240
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:10,099
So, this sinks Pierce, right?

241
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,701
If you don't get that
done and signed off

242
00:11:11,702 --> 00:11:13,669
<i>- before this drops, then...</i>
- Can we kill it?

243
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,004
No, you can't kill it. Key.

244
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:16,238
LOGAN: <i>I've killed bigger.</i>

245
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,607
No, not in the last five years.

246
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:20,810
Respectfully, Shiv, take a beat.
You're new to this, yeah?

247
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:22,712
SHIV: <i>Oh, yeah, and
thank fuck for you I am.</i>

248
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:25,882
This stinks of stale, pale male,

249
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:27,949
and you need an outsider to advise.

250
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,120
- Cease and desist, right?
- Yes, Hugo. We're on that.

251
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:33,122
KENDALL: No, we go, how
deep are their pockets,

252
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:34,956
fuckin' scare the shit out of them.

253
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:36,058
Yeah, get word around,

254
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:37,692
our lawyers will go balls to the wall,

255
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:39,061
say he's super pissed.

256
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:42,164
Subtext is this is personal,
we're feeling vindictive,

257
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:44,166
get the senior management
asking where they'll go

258
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,568
- if we bankrupt them.
- SHIV:<i> Dad, cease and desist</i>

259
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:49,704
<i>and a full-on shit-flinging
freak-out is very high risk,</i>

260
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:51,573
<i>but we could get them to delay.</i>

261
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:53,208
Tell them we'll get
into it all with them,

262
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:54,876
we'll cooperate, play it all out,

263
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:57,212
- and then stiff them.
- Um, we could offer up

264
00:11:57,213 --> 00:11:58,914
morsels in exchange for postponement?

265
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:00,482
HUGO: We might be
able to find something,

266
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:02,383
- maybe out of the studios?
- SHIV:<i> No.</i>

267
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:03,685
Bigger. Juicier.

268
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:05,486
- People who are... Sorry.
- (HAND DRYER WHIRRING LOUDLY)

269
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:06,511
Fuck, I'm sorry.

270
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:08,246
People who are writing
about cruise abuse scandals

271
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:10,759
are not gonna be getting
all kissy for a plot twist

272
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,327
- on frat baby two.
- No. Delay is too soft.

273
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:15,430
SHIV: Dad, ignore him.
Accelerate the deal.

274
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:18,700
What the fuck do you think
we've been doing, Siobhan?

275
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,101
Well, I have no fuckin' idea, Dad,

276
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:21,535
because you never tell me anything.

277
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:24,472
Cave on everything,

278
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:26,041
get them to at least
sign a letter of intent

279
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,737
before the story breaks, it should hold.

280
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:30,311
No, Dad, we go for the piece,
we scare them into thinking

281
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:31,980
what they have isn't solid,

282
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:34,049
just fuckin' kill, kill, kill.

283
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,216
LOGAN:<i> Ken, you're on that.</i>

284
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:38,619
Start sprinkling how
fucking unreasonable I am,

285
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,455
Gerri, foot down on the
deal. LOI if we need,

286
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:44,825
They're half-pregnant.
Let's finish the fucking job

287
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:47,728
- before this breaks.
- GERRI: Sure, but I have to say

288
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:49,129
- just legally...
- LOGAN: Now.

289
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,529
I need it now.

290
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,834
What money's floating this year?

291
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:55,335
You mean for a white knight?

292
00:12:55,336 --> 00:12:57,137
I could see what Roman could scratch up.

293
00:12:57,138 --> 00:13:00,340
- Hmm. Tom?
- Roman's hungry.

294
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:03,110
All right. Shiv, let's get you out here.

295
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:06,179
<i>- I need your help on the optics.</i>
- Uh, excuse me?

296
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,515
No. I... I am not flying out to Argestes

297
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:09,816
to be the face of this.

298
00:13:09,817 --> 00:13:12,384
Then what the fuck are you
doing on the phone, Siobhan?

299
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:16,990
NATURE GUIDE: So, welcome everyone,

300
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:19,792
to the Airbus Cultural
and Leadership Walk.

301
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:22,329
We're gathered here
today with a commitment

302
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,298
to sustainability and stewardship.

303
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:28,935
So, this place-based
learning today will focus on

304
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:31,438
creating opportunities
for you to gain the...

305
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:34,374
- Oh, sh... Tom!
- GUIDE: ... perspective for...

306
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,975
GREG: Sorry, Tom?

307
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:37,577
- Tom! Hey!
- (GUIDE CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

308
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:39,279
- Hey, buddy.
- Uh, problem.

309
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,614
Uh, you're not picking up?

310
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,849
- Dude, this is a great group.
- Sorry.

311
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,116
You did good.

312
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:46,764
It's like I've fallen
into a barrel of deal tits.

313
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:47,786
- (LAUGHING)
- Yeah. So...

314
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,655
So, there's a thing about your talk.

315
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:50,689
- Um...
- My talk?

316
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,359
Um, yes. Uh... When it got circulated,

317
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,861
uh, legal and comms
wanted you to be aware that

318
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:58,997
maybe we shouldn't go with
"ATN: We're listening."

319
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:02,801
Uh, okay. I mean, I really
do like, "We're listening."

320
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:05,837
It sounds like... I mean, it
sounds like we're listening.

321
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:07,439
- No. Sure, it's just...
- Yeah.

322
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,176
It's just, um, there's
apparently, in the EPG

323
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:11,777
on the set top boxes,

324
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:16,448
the voice activation
mode, it does, um...

325
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:19,284
Like, there's a gray area in
terms of our data collection,

326
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:21,319
so that we are kind of like, uh...

327
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,722
We actually are listening.

328
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:24,790
We're listening?

329
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,224
It's complicated, but... but, yeah.

330
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:27,515
It seems that we are sometimes,

331
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,828
uh, listening quite aggressively.

332
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:31,129
- We're listening?
- Yeah.

333
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,199
But it's just to, like,
maximize the user experience.

334
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,767
But if that was to break,

335
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:36,935
- maybe...
- Oh, fuck!

336
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:38,403
So, yeah.

337
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:40,706
So, the question is, is it a smart thing

338
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:42,974
for you to be saying, "We're listening",

339
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:44,576
when we are indeed listening?

- RHEA: You slept okay?
- Couple of hours. The usual.

683
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:28,638
What am I supposed to do with this?

684
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:30,840
- You wear it, Nancy.
- Oh, absolutely not.

685
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:33,043
Oh, come on. Join the fun.

686
00:29:33,044 --> 00:29:35,879
A show of false humility.
Everyone wears one.

687
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,147
Zuckerberg wears one.

688
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:40,282
Hand me a pen and I'll
write my name across my face.

689
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,153
You okay for this?

690
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:46,456
I think I made my
position perfectly clear,

691
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:49,459
but for whatever reason you
felt it urgently necessary

692
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,361
to put me in transit
for grapefruit juice

693
00:29:52,362 --> 00:29:55,098
- and a plate of eggs.
- You should go at your own pace,

694
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,766
absolutely, that's imperative.

695

I just think this is
such a good deal for you.

00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:02,071
For... For us.

697
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:04,239
That it's worth a little haste.

698
00:30:05,742 --> 00:30:08,578
So, we have a little room
for signing right in there.

699
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:11,314

I don't know. Maybe.
Um, what... what's...

- Uh, yeah, let's...

I just had a call from Karolina.

710
00:30:35,404 --> 00:30:37,339
The magazine is not cooperating.

711
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,508
They feel bullied, and
the piece might go up

00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:41,709
this morning. Print, Monday.

- KENDALL: Dad?

718
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:58,025
I'm thinking.

719
00:30:58,026 --> 00:30:59,926
We should leave. We
need to get out of here.

belle of the ball out here.

00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,703
Very discreet.

00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:13,106
You're happy with this table?

going to apologise for
your outburst at Ternhaven.

Oh, I... I... Sorry. I'm tired.

Well, that's appreciated.

My dad is just reflecting our desire

733
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:40,500
to get this concluded as swiftly

734
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:42,769
- and amicably as possible.
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

740
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:55,348
We are ready to sign.

- Ken?
- Yeah. Uh, right in there.

742
00:31:57,651 --> 00:32:00,680
We thought we could sign and
then have a nice breakfast

743
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:02,522
- out here.
- But before we do, I...

744
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:05,592
I think there's perhaps a wider
conversation to be had here.

745
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:08,127
- Uh-huh?
- We would be interested

746
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:10,430

I'll, uh. I'll just have
tap water, thank you.

Um... No, no, thank you.

752
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:27,913
We would be interested
in exploring the option

753
00:32:27,914 --> 00:32:30,448
of a bonus based on PGM performance.

754
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:36,054
Of course. We could
cover the legal fees.

00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,559
Your side, outside counsel.

756
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,926
The whole thing.

757
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,032
Well, this... this isn't really
for us to discuss here, surely.

758
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:51,737
Well, I think I've explained, uh,
there's a limit to our patience.

759
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:54,240
Logan, I think perhaps
we're not going to agree

760
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:55,975
to anything over watermelon.

761
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,508
Well, what's it gonna take?

762
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,179
Why are we still fuckin' around?

763
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,580
I think perhaps we all need

764
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:03,389
a little less sunshine and vinegar.

765
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,185
It always gets a little testy
at the end. We're all good.

could sign the LOI at least?

maybe we should get to
our next appointment?

has read it except me, huh?

Hey. Okay, so where's the link?
Why did no one send me the link?

Um, I do think it's bad, but
it's not that fuckin' bad.

HUGO: They found a woman, Keerson.

806
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:57,059
She was working the cruises
back in the mid '90s,

807
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,996
name-checks Lester McClintock.

808
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:03,165
She says Uncle Mo asked for sex
with her and the other dancers

00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,700
to get their contracts renewed.

- It's not ultra-detailed.
- Amazing.

813
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:14,576
- So they fucked.
- It says sexual exploitation.

814
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:17,245
Yeah, she's saying that
she was one of the only ones

815
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:18,813
who refused to sign an NDA

816
00:35:18,814 --> 00:35:21,549
and that we derailed
her career as a result.

817
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,918
- Is that it?
- GERRI: No, look.

818
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:25,705
The old Hewson story, the woman
that jumped and drowned...

819
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,754
LOGAN: Uh-huh.

820
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:28,356
... what if something happened to her?

821
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:29,991
It's... It's just innuendo.

822
00:35:29,992 --> 00:35:32,493
The dancer says that
she heard stories of

823
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:34,796
dozens of other women who
actually signed the NDAs.

824
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:37,299
Okay, but in terms of actual stuff?

825
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,402
GERRI: There's not a lot of
specifics. It's spooky words,

826
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:44,005
you know, data wipes, NDAs, shadow logs,

827
00:35:44,006 --> 00:35:45,773
hiding cruise malpractice.

828
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:49,311
But cold hard facts, it's
one woman in the 1990s,

829
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:52,146
not like 20 women four years ago.

830
00:35:52,147 --> 00:35:55,049
Great. I'm glad we're able
to do such good victim math.

831
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,818
Gerri's just saying
it doesn't necessarily

832
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:59,286
- punch through.
- Sure. But you know...

833
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:02,389
- this is not okay.
- We know it's not okay, Kendall.

834
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,958
We're preparing a corporate response.

835
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,292
Do we have outside PR?

836
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:07,428
Pinks passed. We've got J Preston.

837
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:08,629
SHIV: No, seriously?

838
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,117
They're three disgusting,
old, white dudes.

839
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:13,334
They'll probably just say
they're money-grubbing sluts.

840
00:36:13,335 --> 00:36:16,437
- It's bad PR to hire them.
- I mean, call me sociopathic,

841
00:36:16,438 --> 00:36:18,706
but doesn't this all seem a tiny bit...

842
00:36:18,707 --> 00:36:21,075
quaint in comparison
to the past few years?

843
00:36:21,076 --> 00:36:22,743
LOGAN: He's right.

844
00:36:22,744 --> 00:36:24,845
It's cultural splash back.

845
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:27,647
We're being punished
for the sins of others.

846
00:36:27,648 --> 00:36:29,916
No one real gives a fuck.

847
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:33,653
No, no. We... We can't
be seen to minimize.

848
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:36,490
I think we need to
loudly and quickly say

849
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:37,791
that this is not okay.

850
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:40,393
I think the question is what
closes this down fastest?

851
00:36:40,394 --> 00:36:42,662
Do we say it's something
and we'll fix it,

852
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:44,097
or it's nothing and fuck off?

853
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:46,533
Something. There have
to be consequences.

854
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:49,435
Nope. Condemn and move
on. It's just good advice.

855
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:52,672
LOGAN: If we get into it all,
they'll never be satisfied.

856
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:55,942
It's bullshit. It's all about me.

857
00:36:55,943 --> 00:36:58,644
It's not real, it's not honest.

858
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:02,015
They don't give a flying
fuck for these poor bitches.

859
00:37:02,016 --> 00:37:03,382
They hate me.

860
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:08,020
So, no! Condemn and move on.

861
00:37:08,955 --> 00:37:10,689
New circus in town tomorrow.

862
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,926
What about the, um, panel? Kendall?

863
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:15,561
Roman? Do we cancel?

864
00:37:15,562 --> 00:37:17,163
No! Fuck no!

865
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:18,864
No. Obviously not, no.

866
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:20,273
- I meant...
- Obviously, it'd be great

867
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:23,002
if we do go ahead with
it, to, uh, have a person

868
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:25,203
who could speak to it in terms of...

869
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:27,339
A woman.

870
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:30,309
- Gerri?
- Well, not legal counsel.

871
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,477
That gives the wrong sign.

872
00:37:31,478 --> 00:37:35,346
No, I mean... It's
something of a no-brainer.

873
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,888
I... I don't know, I...

874
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:45,791
- Come on. I just got here.
- Oh, Shiv.

875
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,793
Would you? Please?

876
00:37:47,794 --> 00:37:50,295
Oh, come on. I'm not good
enough for an invitation,

877
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:52,665
and suddenly this blows up
and you wanna jam it up my...

878
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,533
fucking uterus and smother
it in estrogen? Please.

879
00:37:56,102 --> 00:37:57,502
No, I...

880
00:37:57,503 --> 00:37:59,204
I'm not fully briefed.

881
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:01,139
We don't need Shiv. I can do it.

882
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,141
We can do it.

883
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:05,309
Fine. We could do with your help,

884
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,211
but fine.

885
00:38:08,147 --> 00:38:10,815
Okay. Let's get out there.

886
00:38:10,816 --> 00:38:12,417
- ROMAN: Walk of shame?
- Yeah.

887
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:15,520
Everybody out. Business as usual.

888
00:38:15,521 --> 00:38:17,189
So, you want me to touch base with Rhea,

889
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,525
- take the temperature?
- No, no, no, no, no.

890
00:38:20,526 --> 00:38:21,859
No one speaks to Rhea.

891
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,329
- Me, Laird, no one else.
- GERRI: Right.

892
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,733
Shiv, you're with me.

893
00:38:32,238 --> 00:38:34,239
ROMAN: Little miss
fucking credible, huh?

894
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,541
- (CELLPHONE CHIMES)
- Logan, your 6:00 PM canceled.

895
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:38,876
- Also, your 7:30.
- Qatari money?

896
00:38:38,877 --> 00:38:40,711
Uh, he said he'd meet for coffee.

897
00:38:40,712 --> 00:38:41,945
Wary about dinner.

898
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:44,415
And Jack canceled dinner.

899
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,716
Playground bullshit.

900
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:47,551
Everyone's waiting to
see how it plays out.

901
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,120
- (LAUGHING)
- Hang back a second.

902
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,211
What's up, dude?

903
00:38:50,212 --> 00:38:52,055
I guess if you did
have something going on,

904
00:38:52,056 --> 00:38:53,790
you know, like, deal-wise,
it's kinda, like,

905
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,859
dead in the water now, right?

906
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,261
Like some of the women
that went on those cruises.

907
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:02,198
Ken, I'm so sorry, bro. I feel for you.

908
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:10,973
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

909
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:20,049
- Hi.
- SHIV: How are you?

910
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,551
- Okay.
- SHIV: Uh-huh.

911
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:23,819
- You?
- SHIV: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

912
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,886
Good.

913
00:39:27,558 --> 00:39:28,657
Jamie...

914
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,928
- You've seen?
- Uh-huh. Yeah. It's not good.

915
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:34,930
- LOGAN: No.
- It's not good for the Pierces,

916
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:37,367
it's not good for the proxy fight.

917
00:39:37,368 --> 00:39:41,237
- I need to speak to Rhea.
- I've tried calling.

918
00:39:41,238 --> 00:39:42,671
Several times.

919
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:44,774
I'm wondering, in any event,

920
00:39:44,775 --> 00:39:47,810
if I'm the right flavor of
person to be reaching out.

921
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:51,079
Now my reputation seems to
be a fluctuating currency.

922
00:39:52,315 --> 00:39:55,851
But, uh, young Siobhan,
she's as close to T-Bills

923
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,351
as we're likely to get.

924
00:40:00,057 --> 00:40:01,691
- (GRUNTS)
- Dad?

925
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:03,492
(LOGAN GRUNTS, RETCHES)

926
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:05,828
- Christ.
- Oh, my God. Dad.

927
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:07,495
- Jesus.
- Dad?

928
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:12,101
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're fine.

929
00:40:12,102 --> 00:40:13,836
- Uh-huh. We're fine.
- (LOGAN GRUNTS)

930
00:40:13,837 --> 00:40:17,772
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Okay. We're fine. Thank you.

931
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:31,953
- RHEA: Hi.
- Oh, hey.

932
00:40:31,954 --> 00:40:34,022
Sorry I couldn't meet you for coffee.

933
00:40:34,023 --> 00:40:35,724
I've had wall-to-wall meetings.

934
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,992
No, it's, uh... it's fine.

935
00:40:37,993 --> 00:40:41,195
You're hiding from us. I'd do the same.

936
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,399
How's your dad?

937
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,269
The rumor mill is
saying practically dead.

938
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:50,972
Uh... yes. Fine. It's...
It's the altitude.

939
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:52,407
Uh, so...

940
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,976
The piece. I'm sorry for all the fuss.

941
00:40:54,977 --> 00:40:56,177
You know how these things are.

942
00:40:56,178 --> 00:40:58,112
No, I... I don't, actually.

943
00:40:58,113 --> 00:41:02,116
Okay. Well, uh, for a few days...

944
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:03,517
you know, people step away from you

945
00:41:03,518 --> 00:41:04,619
like you farted on the dance floor

946
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,387
but you ride it out. It's no big deal.

947
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:09,957
Uh-huh. But you're here. Checking in.

948
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:12,893
Yeah. Well, I was
surprised that you called.

949
00:41:12,894 --> 00:41:14,661
The acceptable face.

950
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,630
Right.

951
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,667
So, you heard the piece was coming,

952
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:21,434
and you're still pushing this?

953
00:41:23,071 --> 00:41:24,472
You must really want this to happen.

954
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:26,939
Well, I'm easy come, easy go.

955
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:28,709
Uh-huh.

956
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,811
And, uh, where is
everybody else's head at?

957
00:41:30,812 --> 00:41:33,380
Well, some of the
cousins are still reading,

958
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:35,149
which is surprising, because...

959
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,417
they have views on the
new Jonathan Franzen

960
00:41:37,418 --> 00:41:39,386
three days before it
fucking hits the shelf.

961
00:41:39,387 --> 00:41:41,221
(CHUCKLING) Uh-huh. Comfy on the fence?

962
00:41:41,222 --> 00:41:42,521
RHEA: Yeah.

963
00:41:44,425 --> 00:41:45,592
What about Nan?

964
00:41:45,593 --> 00:41:49,062
Um, she's quite unhappy.

965
00:41:49,063 --> 00:41:51,531
- SHIV: Mm.
- She doesn't like a muddle.

966
00:41:51,532 --> 00:41:55,502
Well, I'm around if
she has any questions,

967
00:41:55,503 --> 00:41:56,636
or to allay any fears.

968
00:41:56,637 --> 00:41:58,571
- Sure.
- SHIV: Thank you.

969
00:41:58,572 --> 00:42:01,074
I guess our first question might be

970
00:42:01,075 --> 00:42:04,477
did anyone kill any girls on your boat?

971
00:42:04,478 --> 00:42:05,845
No.

972
00:42:05,846 --> 00:42:08,080
And, you know, statistically speaking,

973
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:10,617
liners have a high death rate
simply because of the alcohol,

974
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:12,452
and the profile of the
people who tend to...

975
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:16,055
Yeah, but the fact that
I'm even having to ask...

976
00:42:16,056 --> 00:42:18,491
Dead girls, boats? Ugh.

977
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:20,326
It's unpleasant on the tongue.

978
00:42:21,596 --> 00:42:23,630
Well, perhaps the family
would be more comfortable

979
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:25,111
seeking another source of investment.

980
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:32,472
I like your dad.

981
00:42:32,473 --> 00:42:34,341
- Uh-huh.
- But...

982
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:37,711
what sort of a problem
are we looking at here?

983
00:42:37,712 --> 00:42:39,411
Are we in the middle of the storm,

984
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:42,414
- or is this the first raindrops?
- No, my dad has assured me

985
00:42:42,415 --> 00:42:44,382
that this is not a major issue.

986
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:46,384
Oh.

987
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,020
Truth is it's in the balance.

988
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,358
Uh-huh.

989
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:54,893
I think we... they feel that

990
00:42:54,894 --> 00:42:58,330
if it was just a few bad
apples from a long time ago,

991
00:42:58,331 --> 00:43:00,799
then maybe they can grit their teeth.

992
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,901
Well, that's going to be the line,

993
00:43:02,902 --> 00:43:04,535
- so...
- Good.

994
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:10,041
Well, Nan is coming to your panel,

995
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:12,611
so I'm sure your flacks
are getting you all

996
00:43:12,612 --> 00:43:13,746
jumping through hoops,

997
00:43:13,747 --> 00:43:17,382
but if you could apply
a nice tourniquet,

998
00:43:17,383 --> 00:43:18,984
then maybe we could patch this up.

999
00:43:18,985 --> 00:43:21,552
Yeah, it's just gonna
be Roman and Kendall.

1000
00:43:21,553 --> 00:43:26,324
Right. Roman. Okay. Lovely guys.

1001
00:43:26,325 --> 00:43:30,362
- I thought perhaps you might...
- SHIV: No.

1002
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:33,964
No, I'm not, uh, fully briefed. So...

1003
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:36,666
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

1004
00:43:38,537 --> 00:43:39,770
Could you get briefed?

1005
00:43:41,007 --> 00:43:43,440
Uh... I guess.

1006
00:43:46,512 --> 00:43:47,913
This isn't really my mess

1007
00:43:47,914 --> 00:43:49,146
- to clean up.
- No. Sure.

1008
00:43:49,147 --> 00:43:52,417
But... And I mean, I don't
wanna overdramatize,

1009
00:43:52,418 --> 00:43:56,320
but Nan gets cold feet
and you can't buy us.

1010
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:59,490
Your dad could lose control. He could.

1011
00:43:59,491 --> 00:44:01,793
That's real.

1012
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:05,596
There are many different angles
to me appearing on that panel.

1013
00:44:05,597 --> 00:44:08,933
RHEA: Oh, sure. I get
it, honey. But listen.

1014
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:11,168
All I would say is there is a time

1015
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:15,840
to accumulate capital, and
there is a time to spend it.

1016
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:20,444
But hey, whatever. My dad
worked in an asbestos plant.

1017
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,679
So...

1018
00:44:23,515 --> 00:44:25,048
It's all gravy, right?

1019
00:44:30,255 --> 00:44:33,924
And Roman, the safe place
is the three Rs, okay?

1020
00:44:33,925 --> 00:44:35,592
- Yeah.
- HUGO: Regret.

1021
00:44:35,593 --> 00:44:37,226
It happened a long time ago.

1022
00:44:38,163 --> 00:44:39,363
Responsibility.

1023
00:44:39,364 --> 00:44:42,266
Belongs to individuals
and not corporations.

1024
00:44:42,267 --> 00:44:45,302
Remedy. Super tough, super vague.

1025
00:44:45,303 --> 00:44:48,072
The move is condemn and move on. Got it?

1026
00:44:48,073 --> 00:44:49,139
- Yeah, got it.
- Okay.

1027
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,008
Right, and if you need to smash glass

1028
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:52,142
in case of emergency,

1029
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:54,144
it's enough of that
and back to the session.

1030
00:44:54,145 --> 00:44:57,180
Family ownership and corporate
continuity in the digital age.

1031
00:44:57,181 --> 00:45:00,149
- Whatever the fuck that means.
- (ROMAN GIGGLES)

1032
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,586
- LOGAN: Hey.
- Hey. Uh, so, listen.

1033
00:45:02,587 --> 00:45:04,721
I think maybe I should
help out and do it.

1034
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:05,878
- The panel?
- ROMAN: What?

1035
00:45:05,879 --> 00:45:06,908
- Yeah.
- Right,

1036
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:08,792
but it's like nine
minutes till show time.

1037
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,927
Shiv, no. We already decided.

1038
00:45:10,928 --> 00:45:12,462
ROMAN: Yeah. We're all prepped.

1039
00:45:12,463 --> 00:45:14,664
Oh, okay, fine. So, send
out the two cover stars

1040
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:16,332
for Toxic Male Monthly, and, uh,

1041
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,267
why don't we get Ted Bundy up there,

1042
00:45:18,268 --> 00:45:20,370
- make it a three-way?
- Shiv, don't fuckin' pull this.

1043
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:23,206
- Okay? We... We asked you.
- Yeah, and I thought about it,

1044
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:24,474
and I changed my mind.

1045
00:45:24,475 --> 00:45:26,476
- What do you think?
- Me?

1046
00:45:26,477 --> 00:45:28,743
- Uh-huh.
- HUGO: Um... Well...

1047
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,482
- It's difficult.
- LOGAN: Oh. It's difficult.

1048
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:33,883
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

1049
00:45:33,884 --> 00:45:36,351
Would you like a handjob and an Advil?

1050
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:39,414
Fuck off then.

1051
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:42,658
It's smart.

1052
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,260
Shiv works.

1053
00:45:44,261 --> 00:45:47,263
It's smart? A sudden,
last-minute line-up change?

1054
00:45:47,264 --> 00:45:49,132
Come on, man. It's panicky as fuck.

1055
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:50,833
She's not even in the company.

1056
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:53,569
It looks... kind of fucking cheesy...

1057
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,603
- ROMAN: Yeah.
- ... to be honest.

1058
00:45:54,604 --> 00:45:56,605
Like, throw our token woman at it?

1059
00:45:56,606 --> 00:45:59,075
Well, it can't be two men up
there right now. It just...

1060
00:45:59,076 --> 00:46:00,109
It can't. Right?

1061
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,578
I mean, if disruption is an issue,

1062
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:04,547
the audience is expecting just Roys,

1063
00:46:04,548 --> 00:46:08,917
so, maybe... maybe we
stick at two, and...

1064
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:12,054
someone relaxes.

1065
00:46:12,055 --> 00:46:14,356
- Romulus.
- What, pull me?

1066
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:16,025
That looks like a humiliation.

1067
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:18,861
HUGO: Well, we could
just say you got sick.

1068
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:21,564
No. No, you don't bump
me. That's bullshit.

1069
00:46:21,565 --> 00:46:24,146
Fuck that. Respectfully,
Dad, why is she even here?

1070
00:46:24,147 --> 00:46:25,233
Because I was fucking invited.

1071
00:46:25,234 --> 00:46:26,535
No. I need to be out there, okay?

1072
00:46:26,536 --> 00:46:30,161
We need to hang tough,
you know? Together. Family.

1073
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,324
Oh, okay, so let's just
get Connor down here, then?

1074
00:46:32,325 --> 00:46:33,648
- ROMAN: Oh, yeah, get Connor...
- We'll all pile on

1075
00:46:33,649 --> 00:46:35,040
so no one's nose gets put
out of joint. Is that...

1076
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,497
- That's the important thing.
- I will put your nose

1077
00:46:36,498 --> 00:46:37,721
- out of joint
- SHIV: Oh, you should say that

1078
00:46:37,722 --> 00:46:39,610
- on the panel.
- That's a funny joke, Siobhan.

1079
00:46:39,611 --> 00:46:41,201
If you wanna know what
I really think, I think

1080
00:46:41,202 --> 00:46:43,092
you should drop both these
two, and I'll do it solo.

1081
00:46:43,093 --> 00:46:45,204
Wow. Someone thinks they're Beyonce.

1082
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:46,806
Pretty desperate, Shiv. You know,

1083
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:48,524
exploiting the situation
for personal gain.

1084
00:46:48,525 --> 00:46:50,884
I'm just thinking about
what's best for the firm. Okay?

1085
00:46:50,885 --> 00:46:53,470
Oh, sure. Sure. No,
that's, uh... (CHUCKLES)

1086
00:46:53,471 --> 00:46:55,204
That's coming through loud and clear.

1087
00:46:55,205 --> 00:46:57,406
She's a loose cannon.
She is out of control.

1088
00:46:57,407 --> 00:46:58,942
SHIV: Look, Dad. I don't care.

1089
00:46:58,943 --> 00:47:01,778
I can make this go away.
I know this in my bones.

1090
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:03,112
I don't need fuckin' flash cards.

1091
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:05,615
I'm not officially in, so
I have freedom of movement.

1092
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:08,150
But if you don't want me,
then I don't give a fuck.

1093
00:47:08,151 --> 00:47:10,186
I will go eat lobster and
watch the fuckin' roast,

1094
00:47:10,187 --> 00:47:14,022
because it's all...
it's all gravy, baby.

1095
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:22,865
It's important to remember
two fundamental things

1096
00:47:22,866 --> 00:47:24,266
about the news.

1097
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:27,303
One: it's new.

1098
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:29,805
All the things that are new.

1099
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:32,674
The many news. The news.

1100
00:47:32,675 --> 00:47:34,243
Your boyfriend's really suckin' ass

1101
00:47:34,244 --> 00:47:35,577
- out there.
- Two...

1102
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:38,614
Hey, I'm sitting on the
right when we're out there.

1103
00:47:38,615 --> 00:47:40,516
You know, I can see your
bra through your sweater.

1104
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:42,318
- Your dick's hanging out.
- Guys.

1105
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,387
- There's no way...
- Guys, come on.

1106
00:47:45,388 --> 00:47:47,258
- Focus.
- Ro, Ro, Ro.

1107
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:49,939
Do you want me to get a booster
seat for you, when you're out there?

1108
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,964
That's hilarious. Your
period just came on.

1109
00:47:51,965 --> 00:47:57,265
We aim to evolve our coverage
into something that is, uh...

1110
00:47:57,266 --> 00:48:00,135
not only dynamic, but democratic.

1111
00:48:00,136 --> 00:48:02,604
And something that truly serves

1112
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:05,173
our audience's ever-changing needs.

1113
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,577
And that is why we like to say,

1114
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:13,916
ATN: We hear... for you.

1115
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,282
Thank you.

1116
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,453
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1117
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,326
- Hey. Well done, baby.
- TOM: Good luck. Good luck.

1118
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,134
Well?

1119
00:48:35,837 --> 00:48:36,937
Afternoon.

1120
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:39,973
Where's Nan?

1121
00:48:48,283 --> 00:48:50,217
SALLY-ANNE CORDELL:
Thank you for joining us.

1122
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:54,220
Next up, please give
a warm Argestes welcome

1123
00:48:54,221 --> 00:48:56,355
to Roman and Kendall Roy,

1124
00:48:56,356 --> 00:48:59,025
joint chief operating officers

1125
00:48:59,026 --> 00:49:00,526
at Waystar Royco,

1126
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:05,297
and political and corporate
strategist, Siobhan Roy.

1127
00:49:08,903 --> 00:49:11,805
Welcome. You don't do
many of these, Siobhan.

1128
00:49:11,806 --> 00:49:14,173
- Uh, no. I'm... I'm hard to get.
- (KENDALL LAUGHS)

1129
00:49:14,174 --> 00:49:15,708
I'm exceedingly easy to get.

1130
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,543
(SALLY-ANNE CHUCKLES)

1131
00:49:17,544 --> 00:49:21,715
So, I love this idea
of corporate continuity

1132
00:49:21,716 --> 00:49:24,283
being a positive in the digital age.

1133
00:49:24,284 --> 00:49:26,808
But first, I wanted to
give you the opportunity

1134
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:30,256
to respond to the magazine
piece, which came out today.

1135
00:49:30,257 --> 00:49:32,225
- Well...
- Yes, well... Uh, go ahead.

1136
00:49:32,226 --> 00:49:33,993
No, no. Go ahead.

1137
00:49:33,994 --> 00:49:36,462
I mean, uh, I think
the thing for us is...

1138
00:49:36,463 --> 00:49:38,731
we don't want to simply
condemn and move on.

1139
00:49:38,732 --> 00:49:40,733
You know, we'll... we'll
want to look into this,

1140
00:49:40,734 --> 00:49:41,867
investigate it thoroughly,

1141
00:49:41,868 --> 00:49:43,902
and then absolutely do the right thing.

1142
00:49:43,903 --> 00:49:45,971
Uh, I think we all have
the same view on that.

1143
00:49:45,972 --> 00:49:47,440
SALLY-ANNE: Uh-huh

1144
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:49,375
And give us an insight.

1145
00:49:49,376 --> 00:49:51,844
Tough day for the company, Siobhan?

1146
00:49:51,845 --> 00:49:54,292
Well, uh, obviously I've been, uh,

1147
00:49:54,293 --> 00:49:55,483
given the privilege of growing up

1148
00:49:55,484 --> 00:49:57,383
around the business,
whilst also being able

1149
00:49:57,384 --> 00:49:59,285
to plow my own furrow on the outside.

1150
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:01,053
She's been working in
politics for ten years,

1151
00:50:01,054 --> 00:50:02,820
so don't hold out for a straight answer.

1152
00:50:02,821 --> 00:50:03,888
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1153
00:50:03,889 --> 00:50:06,625
Oh, I'll give you a straight answer.

1154
00:50:06,626 --> 00:50:09,361
Look, obviously, as you say,
yes, it's been a tough day

1155
00:50:09,362 --> 00:50:11,062
for the company.

1156
00:50:11,063 --> 00:50:15,033
Sometimes there are, uh...
not errors, not misjudgements

1157
00:50:15,034 --> 00:50:16,301
in corporate governance,

1158
00:50:16,302 --> 00:50:18,637
- but, um...
- Catastrophes?

1159
00:50:18,638 --> 00:50:21,630
Well, no, because it's not really about

1160
00:50:21,631 --> 00:50:24,309
corporate procedures here, is it?

1161
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,846
It's about human decency

1162
00:50:25,847 --> 00:50:27,679
that transcends management structures.

1163
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,395
I mean, you know, that's
what's so abhorrent

1164
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:30,882
about these stories
when they come to light,

1165
00:50:30,883 --> 00:50:32,116
in whatever sector.

1166
00:50:32,117 --> 00:50:33,265
And sometimes it feels like,

1167
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:34,986
"my God, it's... it's everywhere."

1168
00:50:34,987 --> 00:50:38,255
Yeah, that... that's absolutely
right. Uh... I mean,

1169
00:50:38,256 --> 00:50:40,792
the language... I just would say, um...

1170
00:50:40,793 --> 00:50:42,626
Yeah, we don't know.

1171
00:50:42,627 --> 00:50:44,428
Right now, we just don't know.

1172
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:46,630
We haven't started the
necessary investigation,

1173
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:49,000
so that language is, uh...

1174
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:51,002
But absolutely, on the sentiment.

1175
00:50:51,003 --> 00:50:52,469
I think he's telling me to calm down.

1176
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,604
(PANEL AND AUDIENCE LAUGH)

1177
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:56,007
No, no, no. Hell, no. No, I'm not. Uh...

1178
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:58,710
I... You know, if this stuff is true,

1179
00:50:58,711 --> 00:51:00,311
doesn't matter to the victim

1180
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:02,413
if these were isolated incidents
that happened, you know,

1181
00:51:02,414 --> 00:51:05,049
- many decades ago, right?
- SHIV: Right, and just because

1182
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,383
it did happen 25 years ago,

1183
00:51:06,384 --> 00:51:08,820
is not a reason to simply
condemn and just move on.

1184
00:51:08,821 --> 00:51:10,621
No. No. Absolutely not.

1185
00:51:10,622 --> 00:51:13,691
You know, we've been accruing
and maintaining brand loyalty

1186
00:51:13,692 --> 00:51:16,793
for decades, and that
trust is a result of

1187
00:51:16,794 --> 00:51:17,928
knowing and respecting

1188
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:19,697
- our customers...
- Stop looking around.

1189
00:51:19,698 --> 00:51:20,797
You will hurt your neck.

1190
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:22,433
KENDALL: ... to compromise that trust,

1191
00:51:22,434 --> 00:51:25,001
we'll take the necessary
steps to make amends.

1192
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:27,504
Uh, we'll do whatever
it takes, you know.

1193
00:51:27,505 --> 00:51:29,405
We'll do whatever anyone wants.

1194
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:34,845
You know, it's... it's about
being completely unimpeachable.

1195
00:51:34,846 --> 00:51:37,514
And sometimes companies
develop bad habits,

1196
00:51:37,515 --> 00:51:39,983
and you need fresh eyes, clean hands,

1197
00:51:39,984 --> 00:51:41,418
and new ideas to address those.

1198
00:51:41,419 --> 00:51:43,754
KENDALL: Yeah, I mean, that...
that's, uh, the great thing

1199
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:45,855
about a company that's
structured like ours.

1200
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:48,190
We can do that while
retaining core values,

1201
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:49,459
you know, manage change.

1202
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,894
- He's good, right? He's great.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1203
00:51:51,895 --> 00:51:53,162
I think I'm a little more aggressive.

1204
00:51:53,163 --> 00:51:55,131
Sometimes I think you just
need a good old fashioned

1205
00:51:55,132 --> 00:51:57,032
dinosaur cull.

1206
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:59,969
SALLY-ANNE: And who's the big T-Rex

1207
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,003
in your sights?

1208
00:52:01,004 --> 00:52:05,275
Oh, no. I mean dinosaur attitudes.

1209
00:52:05,276 --> 00:52:06,876
Dinosaur values.

1210
00:52:06,877 --> 00:52:08,478
No, I would never go after my dad.

1211
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:11,546
- That's a sport others enjoy.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1212
00:52:17,655 --> 00:52:20,756
- Hey, Tom. You did good.
- Hey.

1213
00:52:20,757 --> 00:52:22,299
Sorry I wasn't there for you before,

1214
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,593
but, you know, "we hear for you" now.

1215
00:52:24,594 --> 00:52:28,096
(TOM CHUCKLES) No worries.
You fucking shimmered.

1216
00:52:28,097 --> 00:52:29,864
- SHIV: Thank you.
- TOM: Was that all okayed?

1217
00:52:29,865 --> 00:52:33,168
Nice. Bring your
daughter to the slaughter.

1218
00:52:33,169 --> 00:52:35,671
Tell the old dinosaur
what you were gonna do?

1219
00:52:35,672 --> 00:52:36,971
KENDALL: Hey, I'm sorry.

1220
00:52:36,972 --> 00:52:39,341
"We will do whatever anyone wants"?

1221
00:52:39,342 --> 00:52:42,577
- Yeah.
- Fuck it! Right? It played.

1222
00:52:42,578 --> 00:52:44,279
It's just words. There
was no press anyway,

1223
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,847
so who gives a shit?

1224
00:52:45,848 --> 00:52:47,649
- Hey.
- What?

1225
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:50,217
- What was that?
- I was just dancing.

1226
00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:55,089
Hey, I'm sorry about Nia last night.

1227
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,792
- You can do whatever you like.
- Thank you.

1228
00:52:57,793 --> 00:52:59,527
It's not like I really want to.

1229
00:52:59,528 --> 00:53:01,195
- Really?
- No.

1230
00:53:02,631 --> 00:53:05,800
Because, truthfully, when
I saw you talking to her,

1231
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:07,969
I wanted to smack her
in the face and say,

1232
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,871
"Back up, bitch. He's mine."

1233
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:11,405
- (BOTH LAUGHING)
- You should've.

1234
00:53:11,406 --> 00:53:13,041
I would've really
liked to have seen that.

1235
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:14,741
SHIV: Oh, yeah? (LAUGHS)

1236
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:21,716
It was too much, Siobhan.

1237
00:53:21,717 --> 00:53:23,784
- Dinosaurs?
- Uh...

1238
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:26,754
Yeah. It was over the line.
Shiv went over the line.

1239
00:53:26,755 --> 00:53:28,155
Oh, I... I think it was pretty clear

1240
00:53:28,156 --> 00:53:30,290
- that I was talking about...
- Oh, no, it was clear. Yeah.

1241
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,394
You tortured the old dinosaur.
You barbecued him live, hmm?

1242
00:53:33,395 --> 00:53:34,662
Don't fuck with me!

1243
00:53:34,663 --> 00:53:36,937
Hey! No! Don't fucking touch him!

1244
00:53:36,938 --> 00:53:38,232
SHIV: It's okay. Jesus, Dad.

1245
00:53:38,233 --> 00:53:41,201
It played well, okay?
Word is it played well.

1246
00:53:41,202 --> 00:53:43,203
- It's okay.
- SHIV: Ro, are you okay?

1247
00:53:43,204 --> 00:53:44,738
- (ROMAN SPITS)
- SHIV: Here.

1248
00:53:45,607 --> 00:53:47,609
- SHIV: You all right?
- KENDALL: You all right?

1249
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:48,676
Yeah, I'm fuckin' fine.

1250
00:53:48,677 --> 00:53:50,377
Fucking leave me alone. I'm fine.

1251
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:53,913
It's just a tooth. I'll get another one.

1252
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,125
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
as it's traditional

1253
00:54:05,126 --> 00:54:07,694
to roast us home from Argestes,

1254
00:54:07,695 --> 00:54:09,396
it's the Argie awards.

1255
00:54:09,397 --> 00:54:12,266
And please welcome your
host for this evening,

1256
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:13,666
Zell Simmons!

1257
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,668
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1258
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:19,606
Hey.

1259
00:54:19,607 --> 00:54:21,841
All right. How you doin'?

1260
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,344
All right. Look at all you
guys with your blazers on,

1261
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,546
coming from Burlington
Coat Factory, huh?

1262
00:54:26,547 --> 00:54:28,615
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
- That where y'all shop at?

1263
00:54:28,616 --> 00:54:30,617
I'm glad you guys are out here,

1264
00:54:30,618 --> 00:54:32,351
solving the world's problems.

1265
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:34,486
I don't see you solving
anything, jerk-off.

1266
00:54:34,487 --> 00:54:36,422
Yeah, that's like a guy
sitting on a grain silo

1267
00:54:36,423 --> 00:54:37,890
in the middle of a famine, going,

1268
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:39,959
"Why is everybody so down?

1269
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,795
- They don't have WiFi here?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1270
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:44,897
Did you talk to Roman? Is he okay?

1271
00:54:44,898 --> 00:54:47,433
Yeah. Uh, he said he wasn't gonna come.

1272
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:49,268
But... But he was fine.

1273
00:54:49,269 --> 00:54:51,437
All right, who do we got
here? Who we got here?

1274
00:54:51,438 --> 00:54:54,506
Oh, we got... The Roys
are here! What's up, guys!

1275
00:54:54,507 --> 00:54:56,275
Oh, shit, I hope he doesn't do me.

1276
00:54:56,276 --> 00:54:59,845
Ahoy there! Permission
to never fuckin' board?

1277
00:54:59,846 --> 00:55:01,380
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1278
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,715
I think this is going to be a long bit.

1279
00:55:03,716 --> 00:55:05,917
I don't understand this tradition.

1280
00:55:05,918 --> 00:55:08,320
Why do we come to be insulted?

1281
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:10,021
How is this entertainment?

1282
00:55:10,022 --> 00:55:11,756
ZELL SIMMONS: I shouldn't even
be joking about them like that,

1283
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:13,758
because they're in the midst of a...

1284
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,693
"hands on investigation".

1285
00:55:15,694 --> 00:55:18,129
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1286
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,565
Yeah, I hear there's a lot
of deals going down here, too.

1287
00:55:20,566 --> 00:55:22,200
Man, someone's gonna make a sale.

1288
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:25,503
To Waystar. Hey, I think that's great.

1289
00:55:25,504 --> 00:55:27,405
That's like the Hindenburg going down,

1290
00:55:27,406 --> 00:55:29,707
and they're like,
"Yeah, hydrogen blimps.

1291
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:31,443
Sign me up!

1292
00:55:31,444 --> 00:55:34,145
- That's the future, baby!"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1293
00:55:34,146 --> 00:55:37,682
No, that's a horrible
idea. It's worse than that,

1294
00:55:37,683 --> 00:55:40,050
at least nobody was
forced to give a blowjob

1295
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:41,519
on the Hindenburg!

1296
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,052
(AUDIENCE GASPS, LAUGHS)

1297
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,358
- Where are you going?
- SIMMONS: Oh, man.

1298
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,482
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1299
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:50,118
SIMMONS: Look at Logan Roy,
man. I love that guy, man.

1300
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:53,130
- I mean, he's a very nice guy...
- It's funny 'cause it's true.

1301
00:55:53,131 --> 00:55:54,598
Fuck off.

1302
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,969
LOGAN: Hey. Hey, Nan.

1303
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:00,070
- Nancy!
- Let's talk later.

1304
00:56:00,071 --> 00:56:03,173
Oh, here comes Rhea. Of course.

1305
00:56:03,174 --> 00:56:04,475
Oh. Let's talk.

1306
00:56:04,476 --> 00:56:06,176
I... I hope you're not swayed by...

1307
00:56:06,177 --> 00:56:08,779
I mean, you get these
hothouse atmospheres,

1308
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,248
- but we're good.
- NAN: We'll talk.

1309
00:56:11,249 --> 00:56:13,317
- We're good though?
- No.

1310
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:14,919
But we can explain.

1311
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,522
(SIGHS) Look, it's, uh...
It's a tempest in a tea kettle.

1312
00:56:18,523 --> 00:56:20,290
Relax. I drink them by the pint.

1313
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:23,327
(LAUGHS) Oh, thank you.
I am perfectly relaxed.

1314
00:56:23,328 --> 00:56:25,929
But if you want to talk about it,

1315
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,697
- it's over.
- RHEA: Oh, Nan.

1316
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:30,567
- Come on. Calm down.
- LOGAN: A few bad jokes,

1317
00:56:30,568 --> 00:56:32,069
what, and you bend?

1318
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,737
I think you're made of stronger stuff

1319
00:56:33,738 --> 00:56:36,840
- than these Palo Alto pricks.
- Oh, it's intolerable.

1320
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:39,376
I had a call with the family tonight,

1321
00:56:39,377 --> 00:56:41,178
on a number of matters,

1322
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:43,313
and they've left it in my hands.

1323
00:56:43,314 --> 00:56:45,982
Which call? After... After our call?

1324
00:56:45,983 --> 00:56:48,352
Rhea, may I ask you something?
Have you ever had

1325
00:56:48,353 --> 00:56:51,382
any communication or
meetings with Logan Roy

1326
00:56:51,383 --> 00:56:52,756
- that I'm not aware of?
- What?

1327
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:54,024
Um... Not...

1328
00:56:54,025 --> 00:56:56,225
- Not in terms of...
- Are you trying to figure out

1329
00:56:56,226 --> 00:56:57,493
what your attorney would let you say?

1330
00:56:57,494 --> 00:57:01,565
- No! I have always acted with...
- I have been rolled.

1331
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:03,433
I have been sand-bagged.

1332
00:57:03,434 --> 00:57:04,668
This is a good deal!

1333
00:57:04,669 --> 00:57:06,970
You spoke to Logan on the 13th.

1334
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:09,039
What was the nature of that discussion?

1335
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,075
I do not recall. It could
have been any number of...

1336
00:57:12,076 --> 00:57:13,409
I would like your resignation.

1337
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,378
I don't appreciate being hustled.

1338
00:57:15,379 --> 00:57:16,780
This is a good fucking deal!

1339
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:18,414
You won't get a deal like this again.

1340
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:19,449
RHEA: It is a good deal,

1341
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,618
and I have never had anything in mind

1342
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:23,218
other than what's best for Pierce.

1343
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:24,920
Oh, horse potatoes.

1344
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:26,956
You work for Rhea Jarell.

1345
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:29,848
And as long as our interests
were aligned, it was fine.

1346
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:31,059
You'll be hearing from the lawyers.

1347
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,928
Hey. Hey, hey! I haven't finished.

1348
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:36,298
NAN: Good night to you both.
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

1349
00:57:36,299 --> 00:57:37,365
You turn this down

1350
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:39,334
and you're fucking your whole family.

1351
00:57:39,335 --> 00:57:40,970
Oh, I think my family will be fine,

1352
00:57:40,971 --> 00:57:42,204
but thank you for your concern.

1353
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:43,772
- Let's go.
- LOGAN: Hey, wait!

1354
