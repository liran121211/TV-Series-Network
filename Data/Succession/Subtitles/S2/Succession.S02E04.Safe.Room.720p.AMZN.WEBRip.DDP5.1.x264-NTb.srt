2
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:06,890
We're going for PGM.

3
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:08,540
We leverage up and eat Pierce,

4
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,857
we're too big for Sandy
and Stewey to come for.

5
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:13,058
We all like this?

6
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:16,707
Contact with the family did
have one heavyweight they liked.

7
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:17,832
Frank.

8
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,040
It's not been the same without you.

9
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,415
It's been better.

10
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,582
Carolina has bad news
about the biography.

11
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,499
The writer, anyone who speaks to her,

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,666
they're dead to me.

13
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,499
You're pals with Naomi Pierce, right?

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,582
You want to use Naomi to broker a deal?

15
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:30,583
Bingo.

16
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,332
The Pierce family got word
that you were on maneuvers.

17
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,708
We need to back right off.

18
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,082
Someone spiked Pierce.

19
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,708
Which one of you boars did it?

20
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,375
Boar on the floor.

21
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,625
- What are you hiding?
- What are you...

22
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,082
It was Roman.

23
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,875
He took a call from Naomi Pierce.

24
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:47,957
Roman, you're a moron.

25
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,290
Who backs me on Pierce?!

26
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,457
They're all against it.

27
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,208
We are going after it.

28
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,457
How do I get him to take me seriously?

29
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,916
Do the management training program.

30
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:58,290
Ground floor.

31
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,624
Pierce's CEO, Rhea
Jarrell, she can help us.

32
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,291
Okay, it's time to bring you in.

33
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,832
Hey, Rhea.

34
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,582
Hey, it's Kendall Roy again.

35
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,874
Uh, I hope this isn't getting weird.

36
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:13,707
Um... Yeah, I just, uh,
wanted to check in and, uh...

37
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,040
Frank gave me the impression
it was cool to make contact.

38
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:22,457
Just hoping we can, uh... Yeah,
we can make this happen today.

39
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,540
Would just be good to connect.

40
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,875
Okay. Thanks.

41
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,375
So?

42
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,957
- What?
- First day in.

43
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,374
- Uh, it's more of a fact finder.
- Sure, but it's exciting, no?

44
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,540
It's like you and your
dad have finally admitted

45
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,123
how much you're into
each other, you know.

46
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:44,707
And now you can... You know, not this,

47
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,999
but now you can bang.

48
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,707
Uh-huh.

49
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:53,998
Uh... so what's the current
thinking on Ravenhead?

50
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:57,248
Ravenhead, uh, stick with
him. Young talent, nice guy.

51
00:02:57,249 --> 00:02:58,582
Your dad likes him, and, uh,

52
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,582
he's one of our most popular anchors.

53
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,499
Yeah, sure, but is he a fascist?

54
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,082
Well, that's a very loaded word.

55
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,415
You've seen the video, Tom.

56
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,874
He's right there with the fascists.

57
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,306
It was a long time ago.

58
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:11,998
He was interested in politics,
he gets invited to a conference,

59
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:14,540
he's excited, he has no idea who he's...

60
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,791
who he's sitting on a panel with,

61
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,082
It's all perfectly plausible.

62
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,040
Oh, yeah, it's
plausible, but is it true?

63
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,248
Shiv, come on. Who wasn't
a bit salty when they were 21?

64
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,374
He's grown up now. He
lives in Connecticut.

65
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,791
He's crazy about the Knicks,
he's... he's a lovely guy.

66
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,666
And... and his demo skews younger.

67
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,248
The fuck is this?

68
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:33,540
Ravenhead fanboys.

69
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,082
Ugh. Morning, assholes.

70
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,123
Hey, those are our assholes.

71
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:42,374
Great. Well, technically,
they're your assholes.

72
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,415
Say it loud, say it clear,

73
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,624
Ravenhead is welcome here!
Say it loud, say it clear...

74
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,624
Okay. Now who are these assholes?

75
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,290
This could get ugly.

76
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,082
Can you imagine if someone
actually cleaned up here, Tom?

77
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,624
With a cleansing fucking zeal?

78
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,123
Uh-huh. Like Mary
Poppins with a hard on?

79
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:59,874
No, like me. Or you.

80
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,207
This is it. Wish me luck.

81
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,624
All right. I'm exiting
Earth's atmosphere.

82
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,332
The prince is departing the palace.

83
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,998
See you in six weeks.

84
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,040
If I don't come back, send goons.

85
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,083
They may sacrifice me to their gods.

86
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,165
Welcome to management training.

87
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,207
- Oh...
- Itinerary.

88
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,958
Oh, thanks. Okay.

89
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,457
Welcome, everyone.

90
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,374
Congratulations to all of you
for being selected to be here.

91
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,957
This is very exciting. You all excited?

92
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,965
Yeah. All right.

93
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,116
After this short video,
we'll get you out

94
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:28,540
for a taste of the park in costume.

95
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,499
Okay.

96
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,040
Waystar Royco is a family.

97
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,082
a family that spans four continents,

98
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,707
fifty countries, three divisions:

99
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,791
entertainment, news, and resorts.

100
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:46,248
Working together to provide
a net that can hold the world,

101
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:50,166
or catapult it forward
to the next adventure.

102
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,207
Joining Waystar Royco,

103
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,874
you're joining one of the most dynamic

104
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,998
news and entertainment
companies in the world.

105
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,208
Feel it.

106
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,082
Waystar diversity and harassment policy.

107
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,832
Waystar Royco has worked
hard to develop a tolerant

108
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,207
and respectful workplace.

109
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,998
The company is strongly committed

110
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,332
to making employment decisions
based on valid requirements,

111
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,165
and without regards to
race, color, religion

112
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,248
or religious creed,
age, national origin,

113
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:20,998
ancestry, gender, gender identity,

114
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,290
gender expression...

115
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,374
What the fuck happened with the video?

116
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,832
What do you mean?

117
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,499
I've been cut. It's
me and some satellites

118
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,874
for, like, three seconds.

119
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:29,916
I'll find out.

120
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,165
It's not a big deal, Gerri.

121
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,540
I don't care how many minutes I get,

122
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,998
it's just the message it sends.

123
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,749
Sure thing. I get it.

124
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,998
So, uh, how is it going?

125
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,540
Oh, amazing.

126
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:43,207
I'm stripping back to basics.
This is my White Album.

127
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,248
Is it very horrible in America?

128
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,374
Oh, yes. It's glorious, yeah.

129
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,457
No amount of antibacterial gel

130
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,707
is gonna be able to
wipe the America off me.

131
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,332
This is good for you, Rome.

132
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,248
I know. I'm gonna grow up
and become a real little boy,

133
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:57,749
and learn the price of an egg,

134
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,707
and do phone sex with my
girlfriend like a normo.

135
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,082
You'll be fine.

136
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,874
Just be brave, okay?

137
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,041
Yes, Mommy.

138
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,666
Welcome to the family.

139
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:10,999
Yeah. Finally in.

140
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,457
So, what's on the slab?

141
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,916
Proxy battle tactical shit.

142
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:19,624
Good to have your PR thoughts.

143
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,248
- Yeah.
- Distributors.

144
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:24,582
Check in on Ravenhead. Mo's funeral.

145
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,749
Uh-huh.

146
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,540
So, where should I
base myself? In there?

147
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,874
Not there. That's Kendall.
He has his office,

148
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,415
but on the proxy battle, we keep close.

149
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,749
Mm-hmm. Makes sense.

150
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,040
We'll find you somewhere.
Something nearby.

151
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,791
Yeah. Whatever. I'll float.

152
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,916
So, every day begins with champagne?

153
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,624
Let's, uh... get hammered

154
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,457
and buy a mining company in Tanzania.

155
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,207
Why not?

156
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,916
Hey, Dad.

157
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,083
It's time.

158
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:53,332
- Hey, Shiv.
- Hey.

159
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,582
With food, this yellow one.

160
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,832
I thought Joan was on his medication.

161
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,332
Joan missed a dose.

162
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,957
So, just till we have a
system that we can rely on...

163
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,958
Your sister's just in for the day.

164
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,916
Oh, yeah?

165
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:08,540
Okay. Whatever.

166
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,916
- Just to observe.
- Cool.

167
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,457
Just to observe what?

168
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,415
It's not a big deal, Ken.

169
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:20,583
No, sure. Good point.
Good, uh, observation.

170
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,333
Lucy, can you find Shiv somewhere?

171
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,874
I'm gonna prep with Ken.

172
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,082
Twenty minutes.

173
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,583
- You good?
- Yeah.

174
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,040
Hey, hey! Dirk Turkey!
Can we get a photo?

175
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,207
Of course!

176
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,540
- Hey, picture time.
- Oh, excuse me.

177
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,499
Hey, um, can you take a photo for us?

178
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,541
Thank you so much.

179
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,165
All right, here we go.

180
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,707
- Right.
- Hello!

181
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,457
So I'm guessing you
two aren't fucking much?

182
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,207
- Excuse me?
- You need to get home

183
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,499
and figure this shit out.

184
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,123
This is a sad state
of affairs, my friend.

185
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:58,499
This woman needs satisfaction

186
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,540
that you are clearly not providing.

187
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,123
Thanks for coming. Enjoy the park.

188
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,332
What was that?

189
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,207
I said "gobbledy go fuck yourself!"

190
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,375
So, I'm just curious, Greg.

191
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,540
What does it mean

192
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,666
being executive assistant to Tom?

193
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,832
Um, well, I... I perform

194
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,499
a variety of target-oriented tasks,

195
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,874
and keep close to the deal flow,

196
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,499
- and...
- Sort of, kind of like a...

197
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,083
like a farm hand? Clip his coat?
Uh, do you have to milk him?

198
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:32,207
Uh, no. I just, uh, keep my head down,

199
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,082
and keep the lattes flowing, you know?

200
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,666
You're a smart cookie, you know?

201
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:38,165
- Mm-hmm.
- We should talk.

202
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,207
Greg! When you're done flirting,

203
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,707
can you latte me, please?

204
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:46,333
Oh, ho! Farewell, lords
and masters of the board.

205
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,416
Time for the real meeting.

206
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,791
Hey hey! Who's the hot intern?

207
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,708
I'm not here. I'm just observing.

208
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,791
_

209
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:13,332
She's coming. Rhea. We got her.

210
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,832
Excellent.

211
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,816
- It's real?
- As I understand it.

212
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:19,415
Uh, family doesn't
know she's coming, so...

213
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,916
Right? I mean, why lie to
the old lady, unless, uh...

214
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,041
you're down to fuck?

215
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,415
Now, this is, uh, us three.

216
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,916
- We're the group on this
- Yeah. The family trusts her.

217
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:35,332
You get her on board, that's huge.

218
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,875
She could be our Coriolanus.

219
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,540
He switched sides.

220
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,750
You know, why don't you
take your library card and...

221
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,375
fuck off?

222
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,124
So...

223
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:51,124
What's first?

224
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,457
Ravenhead.

225
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,458
I'm getting carpet bombed on this.

226
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,957
FCC, ADL.

227
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,791
Pierce News is all over it,
and Antifa has turned up.

228
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,916
Can we not get a water
cannon down there?

229
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,582
You know, give 'em a fucking shower,

230
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,916
fucking animals.

231
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,707
The police have it
under control, I believe.

232
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,332
Well, yeah, but I don't think
it's smart to sugar-coat it.

233
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,248
To me, "ATN under siege".

234
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:18,123
- That's our line.
- Agreed. Endorsed.

235
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:19,540
And, uh, I've managed

236
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,661
to talk the advertisers
down off the ledge,

237
00:12:21,662 --> 00:12:23,499
so I think we just
weather the storm, right?

238
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,123
Well, the problem is we've
been asked to comment,

239
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,624
because, um, apparently Mark...

240
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,540
Records show that he got
married at the Eagle's Nest,

241
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,415
Hitler's retreat in Bavaria.
A chapel below.

242
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,625
Oh, God.

243
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:37,518
Uh, ignore that.

244
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,415
- She's not here.
- His agent assures me

245
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,332
that it was a coincidence,
they were on vacation

246
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,666
in the area.

247
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,374
Yeah, well, fuckin' big coincidence.

248
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,999
Uh...

249
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,958
Is that curtains?

250
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,832
I think he's toast.
Right? We just toss him.

251
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,499
Hey. Come on. No coaching
from the sidelines.

252
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,874
Uh, no. I'm not here.

253
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,415
Oh, right. I forgot. You're not here.

254
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,082
Well, what do you say, Ken?

255
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,749
Hey. Enough. Cyd?

256
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,791
We don't wanna fire
him. He's a big draw.

257
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:12,332
And if we cave to this, then who's next?

258
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,791
Tom, check him out,
turn his guts inside out.

259
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:20,875
Uh, but nah. We back
talent. Ravenhead stays.

260
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,082
Connor, you ready?

261
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,082
You okay, honey? I know
how you are about death.

262
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,165
Okay, not so sad.

263
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,415
This is a big opportunity for me, baby.

264
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,123
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

265
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:39,749
Campaign financing.

266
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,082
Mo knew a lot of
high-net-worth individuals.

267
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,832
I'm gonna work the room,
meet some wallets.

268
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,540
The whole church is gonna
be stuffed with weeping ATMs.

269
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,290
Right. So, Marcia called.

270
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,707
Marcia? She called you?

271
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,916
Yeah. She wanted me
to talk to the widow,

272
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,415
see what Mo told the biographer?

273
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,040
No, this is good!

274
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,916
They're involving you in their
disgusting little stratagems.

275
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,415
- Right.
- It means they like you.

276
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,832
Come on. Let's get ready to
shed a tear at Mo's funeral,

277
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,248
AKA the gold rush.

278
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,540
I'm getting a donor boner
just thinking about it.

279
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,249
That's cute.

280
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:16,875
Yo! Hey.

281
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,374
Oh...

282
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,248
Hey, Greg. What's going on?

283
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:21,832
Jonah, say hi.

284
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,749
- Hey, Greg.
- Hey, Jonah.

285
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,248
Hey, I'm thinking of taking
things to the next level.

286
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:28,290
- Uh-huh?
- Footstool fiesta.

287
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,457
We had a bet, Jonah lost.

288
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,374
Be his turn to do it to me one day.

289
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,416
Come on!

290
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,124
Um...

291
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,791
- Just, uh...
- Go ahead.

292
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,440
Yeah. Let... Let me
know if I'm too heavy.

293
00:14:49,441 --> 00:14:51,457
Yep. Will do.

294
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,791
So, uh, Herr Ravenhead. Do
you have anything for me,

295
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,248
ahead of my meet?

296
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:58,666
Um... Honestly, I've been,
uh, been asking around,

297
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,290
and not much. Uh,

298
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,916
I heard he named his dog
after Hitler's dog, maybe.

299
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,290
Blondi.

300
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,791
That's not good.

301
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:09,248
But, you know, Logan
likes and America likes,

302
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:11,457
and "Blondi" is pretty common.

303
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:16,916
No, but I mean, fascist meeting,
Nazi wedding, Hitler dog...

304
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,165
Oh, dude. If it's true, he's gone.

305
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,998
I mean, Nazis, terrible, right?

306
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,415
Nazis?

307
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,832
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

308
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,540
Yeah, they're... they're the worst.

309
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:31,165
Yeah, sure. We all hate
Nazis. And we all hate Cyd.

310
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,666
Right, Jonah?

311
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:35,040
If we look at the aggregate
of all employment opportunities

312
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,457
available on Earth right now,

313
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,832
this is top one, two percent.

314
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,916
We are basically in heaven.

315
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,666
Well, aren't you positive.

316
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:46,374
They'll beat that out of you.
What's your story, Hunky Dory?

317
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,332
Me? I'm an enigma.

318
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,499
You can't pigeon-hole me.
I'm there, then I'm gone.

319
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,540
I'm intellectually promiscuous,
but culturally conservative,

320
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,998
I work hard, but I do not
play hard. I play easy.

321
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,332
- Why would you play hard?
- Good question.

322
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,874
And what is it you're doing right now?

323
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,457
I'm lurking. Like a dormant virus.

324
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,582
Biding my time in the
Fort Meyers resort,

325
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,791
but I'm being stymied
by a variety of enemies

326
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,248
who are envious of my talents.

327
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,123
- Obviously.
- Brian.

328
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:16,832
Uh, yeah. Ron. Ron... Rockstone.

329
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,540
Sure, man. Very solid name.

330
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,374
In terms of proxy statements,

331
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,832
I'm not sure how much you need to see.

332
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,624
Uh, yeah. Maybe just show me everything.

333
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,499
Yeah, uh, because, uh,
that's a lot of material.

334
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,998
I can process pretty quick.

335
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,832
And after this perhaps
we sit down with my dad,

336
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,540
and go through PR strategy?

337
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,374
Oh. He's unavailable this afternoon.

338
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,624
Because what? Monkey
gland butt injection?

339
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,624
Yeah. Something like that!

340
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,916
Getting his hair blown out.

341
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,457
Yeah, his afternoon is greyed-out.

342
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,540
And then there's Mo's funeral.

343
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,792
Yeah...

344
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,165
Does Karolina know?

345
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,874
- Has Colin done his thing?
- Mm-hmm.

346
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,082
Okay.

347
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,832
- Thank you, Jess.
- Okay.

348
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,917
- What was that?
- Nothing.

349
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,958
Uh-huh. Sure.

350
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,249
Well, Jess, so Kendall.

351
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,791
And Karolina...

352
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:17,208
so public-facing. But Colin, too?

353
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,248
Grubby.

354
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:21,082
And Dad's in a secret meeting,

355
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,458
and I'm in here with a coloring book.

356
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:26,624
What's goin' on, Gerri?

357
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,082
Maybe you should talk to your dad.

358
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,124
Oh, come on. It's me. What's happening?

359
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,290
It's Kendall.

360
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,040
What, is he huffing Sharpies again?

361
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,123
Shoplifting.

362
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:40,415
He's stealing? Stealing what?

363
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,123
Candy and vape fluid, I believe.

364
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:44,540
He's stealing vape fluid?

365
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,124
What? He could buy the entire industry.

366
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,791
Well, is someone talking
to him? Is he suspended?

367
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:53,624
Hmm. We're cleaning it up
without getting him involved.

368
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,499
Oh, good. That'll teach him a lesson.

369
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,749
I'm sorry, what the fuck?

370
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,457
How many lives does this guy have?

371
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,583
Logan wants to keep it down low.

372
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,165
- Hey.
- Hey.

373
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:10,290
Just, uh, wanted to check
in and see how you're doing.

374
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,749
Good. Interesting. Yeah.

375
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,582
Yeah, great. So, uh, what's goin' on?

376
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,165
How are you?

377
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,707
What's your next move?

378
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,998
Are you thinking media?
Like, here, or somewhere else?

379
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:25,248
Division?

380
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:27,415
Yeah, you know, I don't know, but, uh...

381
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,166
- I... Do I have to tell you?
- No, sure.

382
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,165
Hey, listen.

383
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,667
- I know you lost your job.
- I walked out.

384
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:37,999
Okay, whatever. It's all good.

385
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:43,832
I just, uh... Yeah, I don't know. I...

386
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,540
- It's good to see you.
- Cool.

387
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,957
Maybe I should come in more often.

388
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,290
Ken? Your thing.

389
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,833
- She's en route.
- Okay.

390
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,999
- What's that?
- Ah, it's nothing.

391
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:01,332
Shiv, it's... it's, uh,
it's not a thing. Okay?

392
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,582
I just can't say.

393
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,749
That's fine, Ken. Do your secret shit.

394
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,165
You seem to be mistaking me

395
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,726
for someone you're in competition with.

396
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,582
Thanks.

397
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,374
Well, that was exciting.

398
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,582
Smuggled in like
Cleopatra in the carpet.

399
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,916
Yeah. Sorry for the cloak and dagger.

400
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,248
Rhea Jarrell.

401
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:58,832
And you must be Oedipus Roy?

402
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,248
- Uh...
- I'm teasing.

403
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:02,123
- Right.
- Are we this way?

404
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:03,916
Yeah, over here.

405
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:06,083
Sorry about the commotion outside.

406
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,707
Rhea Jarell, Logan Roy.

407
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,040
Dad, Rhea Jarrell.

408
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,458
It's lovely to have you.

409
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,083
Please, have a seat.

410
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,040
Now, can I get you something to drink?

411
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,123
Oh, just some water, thanks.

412
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:30,749
- Quite a view.
- Mm.

413
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,207
Lady Liberty.

414
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:38,290
So, the agenda of the meeting
is just to sort of, you know,

415
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,248
check in on how we can
all better work together

416
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:43,415
to protect journalists
in hostile environments,

417
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,749
- and any other areas...
- Uh, yeah, yeah,

418
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,123
thank you for the cover story

419
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:48,540
but we don't need to
bother with all that.

420
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,998
We know you're interested
in an acquisition again,

421
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,624
and, uh, I have a message.

422
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,963
- Oh.
- Yeah.

423
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:59,165
The message would be, on
behalf of the Pierce family,

424
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,666
and the media organization
that it's privately owned

425
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,332
for 150 years,

426
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,998
the message would be a
typically balanced, nuanced,

427
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,874
and objective "fuck off".

428
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,998
Very nuanced.

429
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,791
And is that the view
of the whole family?

430
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:15,207
They're united in that?

431
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:19,082
Well, I don't involve myself
in the palace intrigue,

432
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,707
but overall, the family
knows what you're after,

433
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,207
and they're not interested.

434
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,749
And what am I after?

435
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,666
You're playing your
favorite tune again, no?

436
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,957
Only this time, I take
it some genius banker

437
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,415
has convinced you that the
only way to keep the jackals out

438
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,791
is to leverage yourself until
you're too big to take down.

439
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:41,165
Well, I can assure you that
is not a fair characterization

440
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,540
- of what we're doing here.
- Look.

441
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,874
What do they want?

442
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,499
- The Pierces? In general?
- Mm-hmm.

443
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,166
- Who knows?
- So there is a price?

444
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,499
All I can say is that at this point, uh,

445
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,374
the position is they're not interested.

446
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,916
And you? What do you think?

447
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,333
I think they're amazing custodians.

448
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,123
So you don't have a position
on who your owner is,

449
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,707
because that would
presumably affect things,

450
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,832
- if you weighed in?
- I'm a chief executive.

451
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:15,207
I take my orders from the
board. I'm a mere tool.

452
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,123
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

453
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:20,208
Anyway, I hope this hasn't
been too disappointing.

454
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:21,917
It's been fun.

455
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:28,041
You know, I want Pierce.

456
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,998
But it only works for me fast.

457
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,123
- Very fast.
- Mm-hmm.

458
00:22:33,124 --> 00:22:36,582
So, please, stay. Have lunch.

459
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,082
Oh, uh... My tummy is delicate.

460
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,917
We really only eat
Pulitzer over at Pierce.

461
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,916
You eat.

462
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,415
I'll, uh...

463
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:48,416
stay for five and skulk
out the way I skulked in.

464
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:53,457
Okay, everyone, now
that you've found a partner,

465
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,749
for this next exercise,

466
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,499
I'd like you all to
come up with some ideas

467
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,582
for new rides or attractions.

468
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,248
And then, uh, work it up into a pitch,

469
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:01,832
and we're gonna present
to the group, okay?

470
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,957
What is this, fucking school?
We're pitching now?

471
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,123
What if we fuck it? What if
I can't think of anything?

472
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:09,082
I don't have anything prepared.
Did you know about this?

473
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,248
This is cool. Sounds
like a great exercise.

474
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:12,791
You have no fucking understanding

475
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,082
of how this works, do you?

476
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,957
Like, this, right here?
This is a rank and yank.

477
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,957
It's fucking up or out.

478
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,998
This is a death march
through a fucking minefield.

479
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:24,082
Okay, well, come on.
What do people like?

480
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,540
What do everyday people like?

481
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,332
Um, do... Everyday? How
the fuck should I know

482
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,624
what everyday people like?

483
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,082
I like booking out a
suite at the Chateau,

484
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,165
and snorting purified sertraline

485
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,165
off women that don't know
they're prostitutes yet.

486
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,332
Interesting hobby, Ron Rockstone.

487
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,207
Well, what do the normos
like? What do you like?

488
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,332
- Me?
- Yeah.

489
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,832
Okay, uh,

490
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,957
I enjoy spending time with
my nephews, Cooper and Clark.

491
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,165
I hike. I have several
high-end racing drones.

492
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,290
Oh, my God, stop.

493
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,625
No offense, but wow.

494
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,957
How about terror? Like, actual terror.

495
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,123
Like a VR experience, but like,

496
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:03,916
"I'm actually gonna
fucking die." Like war.

497
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:06,374
Like, we put you in one
of those landing crafts,

498
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,832
and you're about to hit the beach...

499
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,123
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Normandy, you know what I'm saying?

500
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:10,916
No one's ever gone bust overestimating

501
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,791
the American public's
interest in violence.

502
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:13,822
Fuck yeah.

503
00:24:13,823 --> 00:24:15,383
- Write this shit up.
- All right. Yeah.

504
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,624
Hey, Mark. Great to see you. Come on in.

505
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,248
I caught the show this morning.

506
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:23,791
Oh, great. Thanks.

507
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:24,998
Uh, where's Cyd?

508
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,540
She's out on a thing, but she's...

509
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,165
she thought it would be
great for us to check in,

510
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,874
and I'm... I'm a big fan.

511
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,540
Thank you. Thanks.

512
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:34,957
Uh, so Karyn tells me, uh,
you want the full colonoscopy,

513
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,624
- huh?
- Oh, dude. No, no.

514
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,707
We both know, I think,
how dumb these things are.

515
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,791
You know how it is.
It's just due diligence

516
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:43,165
with all the turbulence,
and, can I just...

517
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,791
just need to check a few boxes.

518
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:47,207
Sure, sure. Thank you
for the show of faith.

519
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:52,207
No, no. No... No problem. Okay, right.

520
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:55,832
Okay, so this is embarrassing,
but, um, just for the record,

521
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,123
and just so we have it, um...

522
00:24:58,124 --> 00:24:59,832
You are not, and have never been

523
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:03,083
a member of the Nazi Party of
the United States, have you?

524
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:05,792
Come on, Tom. You serious?

525
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,082
Nope.

526
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,332
Thank you. Sorry to have to even ask.

527
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,415
Uh, bu-bu-bu-bu-bah...

528
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:15,290
And... Oh, yes, the Hitler dog thing?

529
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,957
- Okay, the dog thing's bullshit.
- Great. Great. I thought so.

530
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,083
Different spelling.

531
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,750
- Okay. Different spelling?
- Yeah.

532
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:26,248
Okay. Uh, and this
other one that came up,

533
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:30,415
just to fend this off, have
you ever read Mein Kampf?

534
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:34,415
Um... Yeah, couple of times, I guess.

535
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,947
Couple times?

536
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:38,415
Are there Easter eggs in there
you didn't get the first time?

537
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:41,707
Look, I'm... I'm just...

538
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,499
I'm interested in that
period of history, Tom. Okay?

539
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,582
- I skimmed it.
- Skimmed. Yeah. Thank you.

540
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:50,332
And, um... And what, specifically,

541
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:53,666
do you find interesting
about that period of history?

542
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,874
The scale. The tragedy.

543
00:25:56,875 --> 00:26:01,040
Hell yeah. Yeah. Which
tragedy, specifically?

544
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,207
Europe decimated.

545
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,749
Seven million Germans,

546
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,291
twenty million Russians,
five million Poles.

547
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:14,332
Yeah. Just... Just checking
the till here, Mark,

548
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,499
and it seems you're short a few million.

549
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:22,457
- What was that?
- The fuck was that?

550
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:25,666
- Shooter. Shooter!
- What? What did he say?

551
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,415
- What did he say?
- Shooter.

552
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:29,582
Sir? Please... Please
follow me. Yeah. Come on.

553
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,457
- Do we have a safe room?
- We have a secure location.

554
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,832
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

555
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,874
Excuse me. Executives coming through!

556
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,333
Gangway!

557
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:42,457
Apologies. There seems to
be a fire alarm sounding.

558
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:45,415
We'll find out the cause of
that and be right back with you,

559
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:46,666
after the break.

560
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,666
Please follow me. Everybody, please...

561
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,290
- please follow me.
- What's going on?

562
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:51,791
We have to evacuate.

563
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:55,332
Oh, God... Oh, my God.
What... What the fuck?

564
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,415
There was a gunshot
from somewhere down the hall.

565
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,998
Shooter in the building.
We think they got in.

566
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:00,582
- Holy shit!
- Where are the others?

567
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:01,832
Where's Logan and Shiv?

568
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,457
- Are we still on the air?
- I dunno.

569
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,248
This is them, right?
Antifa? Or a maniac?

570
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,082
Are they trying to come get us?

571
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,749
Maybe she's gone outside.

572
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,415
Maybe we should try to get outside.

573
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:13,916
- No, we should try...
- This is...

574
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:16,040
This is the safe room, okay?
This is the panic room.

575
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:17,666
- What? How is it safe?
- We're safe here.

576
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,332
- Calm down!
- It's just a room!

577
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,374
What is this? What's happening?

578
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,082
We'll get on that, sir.

579
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,290
- We just wanna get you safe.
- Where's Kendall? Is he safe?

580
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,791
We'll find them.

581
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:28,374
Open the door, please.

582
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,166
Thank you.

583
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:39,207
Shiv! Shiv, thank God! Thank God!

584
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,332
- Are you okay?
- Tom, what's going on?

585
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:44,123
I'm not sure. I'm hearing
crazies or maybe Antifa.

586
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:45,874
We think they were coming for me.

587
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,290
Coming for you?

588
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,248
Yeah, maybe. You know,
head of ATN. Decapitate.

589
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:51,582
Wait, what? Who said that?

590
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:52,916
Okay, well, where are you now?

591
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:54,666
Uh, I'm in the panic room with Greg.

592
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:55,957
Okay, great. I'm coming there now.

593
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:58,124
Okay, hurry. Be safe. See you soon.

594
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:01,248
Are you armed?

595
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:03,540
I'm not allowed to disclose
that information, sir.

596
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,082
Wait. If... If he's the target

597
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,749
maybe he should get his own room.

598
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,958
Thank you.

599
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,123
Hey.

600
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,457
- How you' doing?
- Hi. How you doing?

601
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:33,916
- You want anything?
- Uh...

602
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,666
- You want some water?
- Where's Kendall?

603
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,624
- Is he safe?
- Uh, yeah, I don't know.

604
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,123
What is this, Siobhan?

605
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:44,124
- Uh, Antifa maybe. They think.
- Pieces of shit.

606
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:46,038
Where's Tom?

607
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,248
So what are you hearing? Is it all over?

608
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:51,165
Things seem to have
calmed down, but honestly,

609
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,625
- I can't get a read, sir.
- Okay.

610
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:58,332
- Any updates?
- Hey, Shiv.

611
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,582
Tom, where are you?

612
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,624
- I'm with Dad.
- What? Where?

613
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,749
I... I'm in the fucking panic room!

614
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,624
There's two panic rooms?

615
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:09,707
I think... I'm in the wrong...
I'm in the wrong panic room.

616
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,916
Well, just, uh... Just
stay where you are. It's...

617
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,415
Is there more shooting?

618
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:17,332
Uh, no. No. It's all quiet here.
What a... How about you?

619
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,832
No. Good. Was there really a shooter?

620
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:23,123
I don't... I don't... Who else
is in there with you, Shiv?

621
00:29:23,124 --> 00:29:24,499
- Is Cyd in there?
- No.

622
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,415
It's, uh, just me and...

623
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:30,791
Hey, uh, Tom, I should go.
Stay safe. I love you. Bye.

624
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,832
What the fuck? We got the shit room!

625
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,098
That makes total sense

626
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:37,540
because this safe room
doesn't feel that safe. Okay?

627
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,624
I mean, is that airtight?

628
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:43,749
Or... And is that bulletproof?
Are these windows bulletproof?

629
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,248
I mean, they could
waft gas in here. Right?

630
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:48,165
I don't think this
speculation is very helpful.

631
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,832
I mean, these are the
things you think about

632
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:51,415
when you're designing a panic room!

633
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,749
So, I'm just saying.

634
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,290
And a person can fit through there.

635
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,540
A person can definitely
fit through that window.

636
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,582
A small person. An attack child.

637
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:01,123
Okay, I need you to get
me to the other safe room,

638
00:30:01,124 --> 00:30:02,540
- the real one, right away.
- Sir...

639
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,248
- Have you taken your pills?
- What?

640
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:07,082
- Does Kendall have your meds?
- I... I don't know.

641
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,707
You want something?
How's your blood sugar?

642
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,998
- You want some beef jerky?
- Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

643
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:16,205
- Oh. Hey. Are you okay?
- I was on my way out,

644
00:30:16,206 --> 00:30:18,457
and, I have to say, this seems
like a very drastic way

645
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,791
of keeping me on the premises.

646
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:22,040
Here, come, sit. Are we on air yet?

647
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,624
Do you know who was hurt?

648
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:24,998
Waiting on updates.

649
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:26,791
Any more shots?

650
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,998
Rhea Jarrell. Hi.

651
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:31,332
Siobhan. How are you?

652
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:34,457
Uh, yeah. As good as I can be.

653
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,207
We're up. We're up.

654
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,874
... on the 15th floor, I heard the alarm

655
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:41,374
and was told to evacuate immediately.

656
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,791
We were rushed down
14 flights of stairs.

657
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:47,165
I heard one staffer who was
obviously very distressed

658
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,624
saying she heard a single gunshot,

659
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,917
and someone shouting, "Shooter!"

660
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,290
Everyone's okay, though?

661
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,040
Everyone's fine, but apparently

662
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,248
they're not gonna make the funeral.

663
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:01,208
I guess we can't leave too, right?

664
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:03,875
Didn't think so.

665
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,499
- Hi. Thank you for coming.
- Yeah.

666
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,165
I'm so sorry that Dad
didn't get to see him

667
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,998
- before he went.
- Yeah, he was asking for Logan.

668
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:16,165
I'm so sorry for your loss, Maria.

669
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,540
You know, I never met Mo,

670
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:20,290
but I heard that he
was just a great guy.

671
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,874
- Um, Mo?
- Your husband?

672
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,124
We're so sorry.

673
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:28,374
His name's not Mo.

674
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:31,791
- What? You call him Mo.
- His name's Lester.

675
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:34,207
Okay, so why does everyone call him Mo?

676
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,998
- His real name is Lester.
- It was...

677
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:38,791
I guess I haven't thought
about it for a while,

678
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:40,457
but it was kind of a joke.

679
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:44,998
- Like what?
- Mo-Lester.

680
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:46,792
I guess it wasn't a very nice joke.

681
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,499
- And was he one?
- Oh, God, no.

682
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,540
Just, you know...

683
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:57,040
Old Mr. Fiddlesticks, Uncle Meathands.

684
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,290
Right.

685
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,916
Dad wouldn't let us
in the pool with him.

686
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,916
But, you know, the guys
of that generation...

687
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:04,332
It was a different time.

688
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,666
Okay.

689
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,207
Let's get a donor on
the end of this boner.

690
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,666
I feel a PAC attack coming on.

691
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:12,832
It's like the old tunnel
of love, but much hipper.

692
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,666
- And you travel through it in...
- Bullshit.

693
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:17,832
- ... canoes shaped like vaginas.
- Our idea shits on their idea.

694
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,457
Thank you.

695
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,749
Don't fucking clap.

696
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,707
Okay. Who's next?

697
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,333
Oh, fuck. Okay. All right.
Don't fuck this up.

698
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:28,375
Don't screw it up.

699
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:31,415
Uh, thank you, everyone.

700
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,916
- So what we tried to do is...
- Uh, Mr. Roy?

701
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,916
...create an adult-focused attraction.

702
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:37,415
- Okay, so it's called...
- Mr. Roy, um,

703
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,998
just in case you get a
news alert on your phone,

704
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,165
there has been an incident at ATN.

705
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,040
- My dad okay?
- It's been suggested

706
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,582
it could be a concerted
attack against the family.

707
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:48,040
Do you want us to take you
to a more secure location?

708
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:50,916
Yeah, of course I want that.
Get me the fuck out of here.

709
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:52,083
This way.

710
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,874
There's a lot of confusion.

711
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:58,332
We have reporters currently
locked outside of the building.

712
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,832
I'm talking from
inside the control room.

713
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,499
This is not good, Greg.

714
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,040
They're just trying to
make me look like a coward.

715
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:07,666
Hiding in the fucking closet

716
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:09,917
while she's out there
breakdancing through gunfire.

717
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,499
You ran pretty quick.

718
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,290
You ran pretty fucking quick, too.

719
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:17,290
I was just behind you.

720
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,749
Everybody was running.

721
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,874
Lives here are at risk.

722
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,666
But we at ATN will not be cowed.
We're determined to fulfil...

723
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,917
Oh. Nobody hurt, it seems. One person.

724
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:32,749
Look, off the record, I
think we're in the clear.

725
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,207
We just need to hang out
for a little while longer.

726
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,917
- Wait for confirmation.
- Okay.

727
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,375
Oh, fuck.

728
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:45,583
Shut up.

729
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:58,749
Tom? Do you think, uh...
Do you think right now

730
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,041
might be a good time for a little chat?

731
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,332
Yeah? What, Greg?

732
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:09,917
Um, I've just been thinking
a lot recently, and, uh,

733
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:14,291
you know, uh... Yeah,
I don't know. Um...

734
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:19,165
I'm in the shadow of a giant here.

735
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:20,457
AKA you.

736
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:24,957
And, um, you know, like, do I wanna

737
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,998
maybe catch some sunlight
if I'm gonna grow?

738
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,040
Like, would it be okay for me
to maybe take... take a chance,

739
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:32,832
and go to another department?

740
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,540
What? I'm... I'm digging in here.

741
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,791
Yeah, you are. And I'm
just wondering, like,

742
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:39,457
would it be maybe
interesting for both of us

743
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:43,124
if I go work with somebody
else for a little bit?

744
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,957
Sorry.

745
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:50,333
Are you... Are you attempting
to break up with me, Greg?

746
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,667
It's... It's just...

747
00:34:54,999 --> 00:35:01,166
Dude, ATN, human furniture, like...

748
00:35:02,249 --> 00:35:05,624
Verbal assaults, physical humiliations,

749
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:09,165
Nazi stuff, shooters...

750
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:11,998
I just don't love it like I... I just...

751
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:14,667
I don't really love it,
and I wanna go explore.

752
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:16,727
Uh-huh.

753
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:18,186
And then I... And I can come back.

754
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,185
You know?

755
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:23,311
It could be like... like a
business open relationship.

756
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:36,520
This is not a good...

757
00:35:38,228 --> 00:35:41,685
feeling, Greg, that you're
making me have, you know?

758
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,603
Can you stop crunching?

759
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:51,102
Sure. Yeah. I'm sorry.

760
00:35:52,728 --> 00:35:53,894
Yeah, I'm feeling...

761
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:56,019
What?

762
00:35:58,478 --> 00:36:02,602
I just... I feel a
little bit... You know?

763
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:04,727
I know, I know. It's just an idea.

764
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:05,894
Fuck.

765
00:36:07,811 --> 00:36:09,228
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

766
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:22,770
Fuck.

767
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:29,644
Okay, Tom? Hey, hey, Tom. Tom.

768
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,352
- We're good. We're good.
- We're good?

769
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:33,602
We're good?

770
00:36:33,603 --> 00:36:36,311
It doesn't feel fucking good, Greg!

771
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:40,936
Let's just... Can we...

772
00:36:42,311 --> 00:36:44,644
I will not let you do this to me!

773
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:47,393
I will not let go of what is mine!

774
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:50,477
What... What... What...
What am I doing? Ow!

775
00:36:50,478 --> 00:36:52,769
Stop pelting me!

776
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,644
- Fuck! Fuck!
- I was... Stop... Stop! Security!

777
00:36:56,645 --> 00:36:59,393
- Guys!
- No, you back off! You back off!

778
00:36:59,394 --> 00:37:01,602
This is executive level business!

779
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:05,310
- Okay? No!
- Stop, Tom! We're friends!

780
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:06,964
You're one of my best friends!

781
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,893
Are you okay, son? Where were you?

782
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:24,560
Yeah. I'm fine, Dad. I was fine.

783
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:26,477
It looks like there was only one.

784
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:29,310
An employee. ATN segment producer.

785
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:32,352
- What, he went postal?
- It was a suicide.

786
00:37:32,353 --> 00:37:34,019
He shot himself at his desk.

787
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:38,352
Colin, I need a little more time...

788
00:37:38,353 --> 00:37:39,977
Hey. You okay?

789
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:42,685
Uh, sorry everyone.

790
00:37:42,686 --> 00:37:44,185
Just gonna need to
keep you here another 20

791
00:37:44,186 --> 00:37:46,227
while we sweep the third.

792
00:37:46,228 --> 00:37:48,477
Rhea, it's okay if we go back to ATN?

793
00:37:48,478 --> 00:37:49,686
Thanks, yeah.

794
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,602
... within minutes.
They are now surrounding

795
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,519
this building, and to
catch our viewers up here

796
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,602
about ten minutes ago, at
least one shot was fired

797
00:37:58,603 --> 00:38:02,644
inside the ATN offices,
along with screams.

798
00:38:02,645 --> 00:38:04,352
You doin' okay?

799
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:06,519
Oh, um, well.

800
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,727
I'm finding it increasingly
difficult to explain to people

801
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:11,851
why I'm canceling and where I am.

802
00:38:11,852 --> 00:38:16,352
And you were here
having a meeting with my dad

803
00:38:16,353 --> 00:38:18,310
this afternoon, so...

804
00:38:18,311 --> 00:38:19,727
Interesting.

805
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:23,644
It's just, uh... Just nonsense.

806
00:38:23,645 --> 00:38:24,851
How come you're in?

807
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,393
You work here now?

808
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:31,769
Uh, no, I just, uh...
my family owns the joint.

809
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,686
I don't know if you knew that.

810
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:38,477
... no word on any number of casualties,

811
00:38:38,478 --> 00:38:41,851
but we do know that there has
been at least one shot fired.

812
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,769
Not your favored style, huh?

813
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,602
Well, depends what you think news is.

814
00:38:47,603 --> 00:38:51,393
A public utility, or
entertainment option.

815
00:38:51,394 --> 00:38:55,310
You can actually do both.
Inform and engage.

816
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:58,101
Well, it's certainly full of vim.

817
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,644
Full of piss and vinegar.

818
00:38:59,645 --> 00:39:02,185
I take it you're not
taking any offer seriously?

819
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:04,481
Actually, Shiv, we had
a productive meeting,

820
00:39:04,482 --> 00:39:06,941
so maybe let me and Dad handle this.

821
00:39:07,977 --> 00:39:10,435
Sorry. Excuse me. Clumsy old Shiv,

822
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:12,101
stomping all over it in my work boots.

823
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:16,018
It was a good chat, but I think
"hard no" was the take home.

824
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:17,977
There's no need to put a name on it.

825
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:20,519
Doesn't feel right to me either.

826
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,393
And we take her view very seriously,

827
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:25,101
what with her years of
media business experience.

828
00:39:25,102 --> 00:39:27,143
I just can't see it.

829
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:30,185
Like, the thing for me is
that culturally, politically,

830
00:39:30,186 --> 00:39:33,310
your operation, it's exactly
what we lack in the portfolio.

831
00:39:33,311 --> 00:39:36,435
But I don't see how
the business side works.

832
00:39:36,436 --> 00:39:39,393
Uh-huh. Well, I'd say the
business synergies are...

833
00:39:39,394 --> 00:39:40,769
are obvious, you know.

834
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,143
One legal, finance, distribution,

835
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:44,644
marketing department.

836
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:47,185
I think it's the incompatible cultures

837
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:48,810
that... that stink up the deal.

838
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:51,352
Oh, uh, on that...

839
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:54,602
We did have one thing to
mention that could, uh,

840
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:56,353
- address that issue.
- Uh-huh?

841
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,644
Twenty-one billion dollars.

842
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:04,310
Okay. Well, look, I'm a mere conduit.

843
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:07,560
Well, maybe you should conduit that.

844
00:40:07,561 --> 00:40:09,727
You know, I suppose the thing is,

845
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,619
it's an emotional
matter for the Pierces.

846
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,352
Money is not irrelevant,
but... but, how can I put it...

847
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:15,727
Relevant?

848
00:40:15,728 --> 00:40:18,644
- Nevertheless...
- 21.5.

849
00:40:18,645 --> 00:40:22,473
Kendall. I... Is he allowed
to just say numbers?

850
00:40:22,474 --> 00:40:25,935
- Is that enough?
- It's not up to me,

851
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:28,520
so you're just bidding
against yourself there.

852
00:40:31,977 --> 00:40:35,185
Look, I'm a hairy old
bastard who everybody hates,

853
00:40:35,186 --> 00:40:36,644
yadda, yadda.

854
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:41,352
But I fuckin' love news,
and news people.

855
00:40:41,353 --> 00:40:46,268
We can argue the angles,
but I will invest.

856
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,352
Well, it would take a
hell of a lot of investment

857
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:49,685
from where things are.

858
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:52,230
- Twenty-two billion.
- Jesus, Kendall.

859
00:40:52,231 --> 00:40:53,519
Can he say that, Dad?

860
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,602
I mean that's not even the issue, right?

861
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:59,727
- Um, well...
- So... So what's the issue?

862
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:01,017
Editorial independence?

863
00:41:01,018 --> 00:41:03,310
I don't think there's anything
to even say without that.

864
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:06,268
Well, okay, there are models,
right, for an independent board.

865
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:08,685
And forgetting the numbers,
there are structures designed

866
00:41:08,686 --> 00:41:10,602
to ensure the current
philosophical approach

867
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:11,685
is protected.

868
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:14,019
Okay, thank you. And now, um...

869
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:16,851
remembering the numbers,

870
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:18,893
what would move the dial for them?

871
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,810
22.5?

872
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,727
Now, honestly, be careful
or I'll take you seriously.

873
00:41:24,728 --> 00:41:27,060
Well, if the business side can work,

874
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:29,893
then I guess one pitch
for the family could be,

875
00:41:29,894 --> 00:41:31,602
"Waystar isn't coming in to fuck you,

876
00:41:31,603 --> 00:41:34,560
but to make sweet, sweet,
Barry White-investment love."

877
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:36,685
Beauty saved by the
beast would be the flavor.

878
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:40,227
I think it's telling that
your most positive spin

879
00:41:40,228 --> 00:41:43,602
still sounds a bit rapey.

880
00:41:43,603 --> 00:41:47,935
- Hey. Do you trust me?
- Do I trust you?

881
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:49,602
That's not really the issue, Dad.

882
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:50,976
I mean, you're not
gonna be around forever,

883
00:41:50,977 --> 00:41:52,310
so there need to be structures in place

884
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:54,394
- that are...
- Siobhan. Please.

885
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:57,227
This is what it comes down to.

886
00:41:57,228 --> 00:41:58,935
You know, we can draw up some agreement

887
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:00,935
with any number of provisions in it,

888
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:04,477
but you know that if I want,
I'll find a way round it.

889
00:42:04,478 --> 00:42:07,227
So, in the end, it's a question, right?

890
00:42:07,228 --> 00:42:10,101
If I say I won't fuck Pierce over,

891
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:13,770
I'll keep the brand, their
editors, their people,

892
00:42:14,728 --> 00:42:16,435
do you trust me?

893
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:18,769
And will you tell them to trust me?

894
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,143
Uh-huh.

895
00:42:20,144 --> 00:42:23,603
Because when I say
something will happen...

896
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:29,185
that thing will happen.

897
00:42:29,186 --> 00:42:30,603
Am I right, kids?

898
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,143
- Right.
- Um, right.

899
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:36,644
So, will you tell 'em?

900
00:42:36,645 --> 00:42:39,936
Twenty-four. And they can trust me.

901
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:47,311
I, um... I'm with him.

902
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:53,644
So is this the safe room?

903
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:56,893
Yes. Apparently it's impregnable.

904
00:42:56,894 --> 00:43:00,060
Well, um, they announced
the winning pitch.

905
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:02,645
- Oh, they did?
- Uh-huh.

906
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:06,478
Are you attempting to
do suspense on me, Brian?

907
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:08,851
We won.

908
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,685
Oh, look at that. Great.

909
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:14,143
- You don't believe me?
- Mm, nope.

910
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:16,435
Do you happen to know who
they were going to give it to,

911
00:43:16,436 --> 00:43:17,810
before they gave it to the name?

912
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:18,935
I don't think it was the name.

913
00:43:18,936 --> 00:43:20,653
Well, that's very touching,

914
00:43:20,654 --> 00:43:23,185
but I'm basically
fucking Elvis around here.

915
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:24,976
So you wanna go check?

916
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,727
Yeah. Yeah, let's fucking check.

917
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:30,478
Cool. Well, I'll be right back.

918
00:43:33,686 --> 00:43:36,018
Hey, baby, how about
this for the eulogy?

919
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:38,060
- "Lester touched all of us."
- Okay, no.

920
00:43:38,061 --> 00:43:39,727
I don't think you should do your speech.

921
00:43:39,728 --> 00:43:41,976
No one else is gonna get here.
I have to. I said I would.

922
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:44,435
Baby, I think it could be
really bad for your campaign.

923
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:47,268
I mean, I was just talking
to those guys over there.

924
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:50,060
- The Wolf Pack?
- "The Wolf Pack"?

925
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,685
Yeah, Dad's old crew, back in the day.

926
00:43:51,686 --> 00:43:52,884
Oh, Jesus. Okay,

927
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:54,581
some of the stuff that
they got up to with Mo,

928
00:43:54,582 --> 00:43:56,892
- you do not want to be associated with.
- Sure, no. I know.

929
00:43:56,893 --> 00:43:59,060
Still, it's complicated.
It was a different time.

930
00:43:59,061 --> 00:44:01,769
But it wasn't a time before
they invented laws, was it?

931
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,477
I mean, what if this shit comes out,

932
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:05,936
and you're on the record
praising the shit out of him?

933
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:09,477
Oh, this is a nightmare.

934
00:44:09,478 --> 00:44:12,644
Why can't I be the one caught
in a lockdown with a maniac?

935
00:44:12,645 --> 00:44:15,810
Connor? Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

936
00:44:15,811 --> 00:44:18,143
I'm Michelle Pantsil.
I'm working on a study...

937
00:44:18,144 --> 00:44:20,435
I know who you are.

938
00:44:20,436 --> 00:44:22,851
I... I spoke to Lester
a lot toward the end.

939
00:44:22,852 --> 00:44:24,685
He always spoke so fondly of you.

940
00:44:24,686 --> 00:44:26,893
Oh, I see you a mile away, sister.

941
00:44:26,894 --> 00:44:29,018
What, you want to dig
through my treasure chest

942
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:30,810
for some previous memory gems?

943
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:32,101
No, I don't want to make anyone

944
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,685
do anything they don't want to do.

945
00:44:33,686 --> 00:44:36,352
Hey, if you wanna print
something in your little book,

946
00:44:36,353 --> 00:44:38,185
you may print the following line:

947
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:41,935
"Connor Roy was interested in politics

948
00:44:41,936 --> 00:44:43,311
at a very young age."

949
00:44:44,061 --> 00:44:45,644
That's it.

950
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:49,602
Connor. C... This isn't an interview.

951
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,101
We're just two people
chatting at a funeral.

952
00:44:52,102 --> 00:44:55,268
- Fine.
- It's a good turnout.

953
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:57,268
It's a nice church, don't you think?

954
00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:58,935
Tell you what a nice church it is,

955
00:44:58,936 --> 00:45:01,352
"Connor Roy was interested in
politics from a very young age."

956
00:45:01,353 --> 00:45:04,602
Okay. You know you're not
doing yourself any favors

957
00:45:04,603 --> 00:45:06,185
by refusing to talk?

958
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:09,268
Interesting point, to which I would add:

959
00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:12,560
"Connor Roy was interested in
politics from a very young age."

960
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:15,770
I look forward to hearing what
you have to say about Lester.

961
00:45:17,936 --> 00:45:18,977
Come on.

962
00:45:23,811 --> 00:45:26,520
Okay, folks. We're all clear.

963
00:45:43,686 --> 00:45:46,935
- Is he still in there?
- I don't know.

964
00:45:46,936 --> 00:45:48,311
God.

965
00:45:51,977 --> 00:45:56,393
You know, uh, Greg, I know that, um...

966
00:45:56,394 --> 00:45:58,851
it wasn't cool, you know.
The bottles, the attack.

967
00:45:58,852 --> 00:46:01,685
No, it didn't feel great.

968
00:46:01,686 --> 00:46:04,144
I don't always like who I am, Greg.

969
00:46:05,144 --> 00:46:06,977
Yeah, I get that.

970
00:46:08,686 --> 00:46:11,018
But don't you think it
might be just the right time

971
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,686
for me to make a move?

972
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,268
Seriously, Greg?

973
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:17,143
You're smart, you're
ambitious, you're loyal.

974
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:18,852
Why would I let you go? Come on.

975
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:25,976
Okay, wait. I have a thing,
but I... I'm reluctant to say.

976
00:46:25,977 --> 00:46:27,727
- What do you mean?
- I...

977
00:46:27,728 --> 00:46:31,060
I just... I have some leverage,
but I'm reluctant to use it.

978
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:33,310
You know, in case it
sours things for us.

979
00:46:33,311 --> 00:46:35,102
What leverage, Greg?

980
00:46:39,394 --> 00:46:41,228
I just... Um...

981
00:46:43,186 --> 00:46:47,602
Well, I'm not bringing this
up as any form of threat,

982
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:50,228
but...

983
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:52,727
So, you know

984
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:55,727
when you had me destroy
those documents at Cruises?

985
00:46:55,728 --> 00:46:57,227
No.

986
00:46:57,228 --> 00:46:59,143
Well, I... I kept it...

987
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,560
I kept a few of them.

988
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:08,047
Just in case I got in trouble,
and 'cause I was worried

989
00:47:08,048 --> 00:47:10,644
that maybe I was destroying
evidence of criminality.

990
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:12,018
Did you now?

991
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:14,602
So, like, I don't know. Would it be...

992
00:47:14,603 --> 00:47:17,018
I don't wanna bring anything up to you

993
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:18,644
in a way that feels, like, horrible,

994
00:47:18,645 --> 00:47:22,227
but would be bad for me to,
like, mention those to you now?

995
00:47:22,228 --> 00:47:24,976
Are you asking if you can blackmail me?

996
00:47:24,977 --> 00:47:27,893
No... No, I... I would...
I would hate that.

997
00:47:27,894 --> 00:47:31,018
I like you, it's just,
you know, context.

998
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:32,851
Very well. I accept your blackmail.

999
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:34,060
No, I'm not blackmailing you,

1000
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:35,435
- Tom. No...
- But you are, though,

1001
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:36,851
- you piece of shit. Greg...
- I'm not!

1002
00:47:36,852 --> 00:47:39,602
... I'm gonna accelerate you. Okay?

1003
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:43,769
New title. Ton more
money, nice new office.

1004
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,602
You're moving up, you can
throw away the training bra.

1005
00:47:46,603 --> 00:47:49,602
Seat at the big table. You like that?

1006
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:54,893
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I like that.

1007
00:47:54,894 --> 00:48:00,310
You fucking... Look at you.
Where are they, those papers?

1008
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,810
I'll never tell.

1009
00:48:02,811 --> 00:48:05,310
You're a fuckin' slime ball!

1010
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:08,310
- No.
- Attaboy.

1011
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:12,268
For I am persuaded that
neither death nor life,

1012
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:17,602
nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things present,

1013
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,143
nor things to come, nor height,

1014
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:22,185
- nor depth...
- Here you go. I did a pass.

1015
00:48:22,186 --> 00:48:25,134
Let's see her try to make
something out of this.

1016
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,908
... from the love of God,
which is in Christ Jesus,

1017
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:29,936
- our Lord.
- Amen.

1018
00:48:44,894 --> 00:48:46,435
Hello.

1019
00:48:46,436 --> 00:48:49,352
I'm here as a fellow human

1020
00:48:49,353 --> 00:48:54,353
to acknowledge that Lester
has, as we know, passed on.

1021
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:58,560
Lester was a man.

1022
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:01,519
Also, Lester was an employee
of the Waystar company

1023
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,310
for 40 years.

1024
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:05,811
And when a man dies, it is sad.

1025
00:49:06,936 --> 00:49:08,977
All of us will die one day.

1026
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,060
In this case, it is
Lester who has done so.

1027
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:17,685
Lester was alive for 78 years.

1028
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:18,894
But no more.

1029
00:49:20,102 --> 00:49:21,935
Now he is dead.

1030
00:49:21,936 --> 00:49:25,770
Lester's wife is Maria. They
were married for 15 years.

1031
00:49:26,894 --> 00:49:27,936
Now she is sad.

1032
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:50,060
Apparently he emailed a
close friend last week,

1033
00:49:50,061 --> 00:49:52,851
talking of a culture of bullying.

1034
00:49:52,852 --> 00:49:56,227
It's a newsroom, not
a fucking kindergarten.

1035
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:58,352
Again, condolences.

1036
00:49:58,353 --> 00:50:00,227
As the head of an organization myself,

1037
00:50:00,228 --> 00:50:02,851
I can only imagine how
you must be feeling.

1038
00:50:02,852 --> 00:50:05,143
- It's a dark day.
- A lot of introspection ahead.

1039
00:50:05,144 --> 00:50:07,311
Perhaps we could talk again next week.

1040
00:50:08,311 --> 00:50:09,935
Thanks for your hospitality.

1041
00:50:09,936 --> 00:50:11,393
Hope to see you soon.

1042
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:14,727
Well, if not, we'll always
have the panic room.

1043
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:16,435
I'll let them know that number.

1044
00:50:16,436 --> 00:50:18,602
And that they can trust me.

1045
00:50:18,603 --> 00:50:22,436
I will give them my honest assessment.

1046
00:50:23,932 --> 00:50:26,765
And, uh, if you're really serious about

1047
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:30,015
approaching the family,
do yourself a favor.

1048
00:50:30,016 --> 00:50:31,848
A peace offering would be nice.

1049
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:34,514
That Walmart Mussolini
who puts Nan Pierce

1050
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:36,849
off her Old Fashioned, Ravenhead, yes?

1051
00:50:45,182 --> 00:50:46,223
Well done, son.

1052
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,223
Good work.

1053
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:04,887
I fucking killed it, Tabs.

1054
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:07,637
I slaughtered them, and you know what?

1055
00:51:07,638 --> 00:51:10,887
They're jealous. And that's
just all there is to it.

1056
00:51:10,888 --> 00:51:14,970
They are jealous. Um,
anyway, how are you?

1057
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:20,387
I'm good. I'm, uh, yeah. I'm
about to get into the bath.

1058
00:51:20,388 --> 00:51:26,012
Oh, yeah? Um, yeah. Okay.
Do you want to, uh...

1059
00:51:26,013 --> 00:51:29,512
You wanna do this or what?
We got like six weeks of this.

1060
00:51:29,513 --> 00:51:33,095
Yeah, sure. Um, okay.

1061
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:38,388
So, I am making the bath really sudsy.

1062
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,512
Is that because you're a dirty one?

1063
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:46,304
I am. I'm a dirty, dirty girl.

1064
00:51:46,305 --> 00:51:47,512
Yeah, you are.

1065
00:51:47,513 --> 00:51:49,470
And I would love to fuck you.

1066
00:51:49,471 --> 00:51:50,762
Would you?

1067
00:51:50,763 --> 00:51:53,637
I'm so wet for you right now.

1068
00:51:53,638 --> 00:51:58,430
Um, that's not... Uh, you
don't have to be so specific.

1069
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,137
I'm being sexy.

1070
00:52:02,138 --> 00:52:05,702
Yeah, it's just... Could you not
do that thing with your voice?

1071
00:52:05,703 --> 00:52:07,762
It's, like, breathy and unnatural.

1072
00:52:07,763 --> 00:52:10,679
That's what I sound like
when I'm turned on, Roman.

1073
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,387
I know, it's just... I just
don't like it, you know.

1074
00:52:13,388 --> 00:52:15,928
It's just, like... Let's
just be normal. More like,

1075
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:17,970
"I wanna fuck you in the pussy."

1076
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:21,637
Hmm. Okay. Well, I was...
I was trying to get into it,

1077
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,970
but, you know.

1078
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:25,597
Okay. No, fine. You're
right. Sorry. Um...

1079
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:31,680
I'm fucking you. I'm...
I'm fucking you hard.

1080
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,053
Amazing.

1081
00:52:34,054 --> 00:52:36,304
What are you gonna do next?
You gonna, I don't know,

1082
00:52:36,305 --> 00:52:38,345
change your water filter cartridge?

1083
00:52:38,346 --> 00:52:41,137
Ah, Jesus fucking Christ...
Oh! Oh, I'm coming! I'm coming!

1084
00:52:41,138 --> 00:52:44,637
Ah, I came. Yay. Thank
you. Hooray. Bye. Thanks!

1085
00:52:44,638 --> 00:52:46,470
A feeling of hopelessness

1086
00:52:46,471 --> 00:52:48,846
has set in for those watching from afar,

1087
00:52:48,847 --> 00:52:50,470
leading many to wonder,

1088
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:53,554
what is the best way to explain
this tragedy to children?

1089
00:52:53,555 --> 00:52:56,053
Pierce News contributor
David Stanton joins us.

1090
00:52:56,054 --> 00:52:58,513
David, first off, are we...

1091
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,304
Roman, what is it now?

1092
00:53:04,305 --> 00:53:05,928
You know, I'm still pissed
off they didn't give me

1093
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:07,804
- any good footage.
- Seriously?

1094
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:09,637
They're treating me
like I'm a piece of shit.

1095
00:53:09,638 --> 00:53:11,680
- You are a piece of shit.
- Fuck you.

1096
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,345
I found a rough diamond out here

1097
00:53:14,346 --> 00:53:16,846
and I wanna bring him back
with me. Fast track him.

1098
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:19,095
Also, we should build my ride, bitch.

1099
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:20,679
I'll email you. It's genius.

1100
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,095
No, no. We are not building
a ride that you came up with

1101
00:53:24,096 --> 00:53:26,345
on your first day of
management training, Roman.

1102
00:53:26,346 --> 00:53:29,178
Well, you should. I
am an ideas fountain.

1103
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:31,762
You're acting like an
over-excited little boy.

1104
00:53:31,763 --> 00:53:34,387
You know, technically,
I'm your fuckin' boss.

1105
00:53:34,388 --> 00:53:36,345
Go to bed, Roman. Go to bed,

1106
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,387
and masturbate all your ideas out,

1107
00:53:38,388 --> 00:53:40,555
and let's see how
excited you feel tomorrow.

1108
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:45,512
Well, maybe. Maybe I will.

1109
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,429
Maybe I'll just leave you on the pillow

1110
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,928
so you can hear my brilliance cascading.

1111
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:51,637
Fine. I've heard plenty worse

1112
00:53:51,638 --> 00:53:54,012
than a spoiled brat
ejaculating on himself.

1113
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:56,262
Oh, yeah? You sure about that?

1114
00:53:56,263 --> 00:53:58,970
I could be doing it
now for all you know.

1115
00:53:58,971 --> 00:54:00,722
Well, get going. Chop chop.

1116
00:54:07,722 --> 00:54:09,680
You disgusting little pig.

1117
00:54:11,221 --> 00:54:12,263
You're pathetic.

1118
00:54:15,805 --> 00:54:18,596
You are a revolting
little worm, aren't you?

1119
00:54:18,597 --> 00:54:21,638
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1120
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:27,928
You little slime puppy.

1121
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:31,679
Yes. Yeah, what else am I?

1122
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,053
You're revolting, Roman.

1123
00:54:33,054 --> 00:54:34,805
Yes. Yeah.

1124
00:54:44,722 --> 00:54:47,054
Only you can be trusted
with the meds, huh?

1125
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:51,762
Yeah. Till we have a system going on.

1126
00:54:51,763 --> 00:54:54,095
Mm-hmm. So here's a question.

1127
00:54:54,096 --> 00:54:57,429
What the fuck is going
on between you and Dad?

1128
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,095
What do you mean?

1129
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:03,137
Do you have something on
him? Are you blackmailing Dad?

1130
00:55:03,138 --> 00:55:07,721
No. I'm... I'm... I don't know...
We're... We're just in, uh...

1131
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:10,304
We're just in a good...
good place these days.

1132
00:55:10,305 --> 00:55:12,304
Uh-huh?

1133
00:55:12,305 --> 00:55:14,721
All right. Do you have a deal with him?

1134
00:55:14,722 --> 00:55:17,679
Did he make you an
offer in the Hamptons?

1135
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:23,971
Um, no. No, Shiv.
There's... There's no deal.

1136
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:27,679
I promise you.

1137
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,262
Then what? Why's he protecting you?

1138
00:55:31,263 --> 00:55:33,762
Protecting me?

1139
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:36,679
Yeah, the drugs, the shoplifting,

1140
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,762
the... the fucking... the takeover bid.

1141
00:55:39,763 --> 00:55:42,345
Yeah, I'm not sure what you mean.

1142
00:55:42,346 --> 00:55:43,804
Uh-huh.

1143
00:55:43,805 --> 00:55:46,346
Anyway, why do you care so much?

1144
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:50,762
You know, what... what is
this? What's going on here?

1145
00:55:50,763 --> 00:55:54,679
- You comin' in?
- Can we just talk?

1146
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,888
I'm not a fucking dummy.
There is an atmosphere.

1147
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:06,013
Uh...

1148
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:12,387
Yeah, I don't know. He's... He's just...

1149
00:56:12,388 --> 00:56:17,762
Maybe, uh, he's concerned
about me, for whatever reason.

1150
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:20,178
Yeah? For whatever reason?

1151
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:21,721
You'd need to ask him.

1152
00:56:21,722 --> 00:56:24,388
You can't tell me? You can't
tell me what's going on?

1153
00:56:26,013 --> 00:56:27,054
No.

1154
00:56:27,929 --> 00:56:29,054
Fucking look at me.

1155
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,555
Shiv. It's not gonna be me.

1156
00:56:38,847 --> 00:56:41,430
Right. You wanna tell me why?

1157
00:56:43,888 --> 00:56:45,721
Come here. Give me a hug.

1158
00:56:45,722 --> 00:56:47,388
- Come here.
- Give you a hug?

1159
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:55,054
Hey.

1160
00:56:58,305 --> 00:56:59,555
You okay?

1161
00:57:06,805 --> 00:57:11,888
I would just ask that
you take care of me,

1162
00:57:13,922 --> 00:57:18,839
because, uh, if Dad
didn't need me right now

1163
00:57:21,847 --> 00:57:23,597
I don't exactly know...

1164
00:57:27,054 --> 00:57:28,929
what I would be for.

1165
00:57:34,597 --> 00:57:36,263
You wanna talk some more?

1166
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:41,096
I r... I really can't.

1167
00:57:43,638 --> 00:57:44,680
But, uh...

1168
00:57:47,555 --> 00:57:48,847
thank you.

1169
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:53,763
Yeah, it ain't gonna be me.

1170
00:59:58,096 --> 01:00:00,928
Backing Pierce is the
key to our proxy defense.

1171
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:02,970
They're inquiring about
your moral character,

1172
01:00:02,971 --> 01:00:03,971
hence this weekend.

1173
01:00:04,346 --> 01:00:07,220
My worry is that Kendall
may come across as too cool

1174
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:08,221
and likable.

1175
01:00:08,929 --> 01:00:11,597
Welcome to Turnhaven,
our city on the hill.

1176
01:00:11,929 --> 01:00:14,513
Wow, I like this staff. Why
couldn't this staff be Dad?

1177
01:00:15,555 --> 01:00:19,096
Any thought given to whom
you might handover the keys?

1178
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,179
Just whisper it in my ear.

1179
01:00:21,847 --> 01:00:27,054
Watching you people melt down
is the most satisfying activity.

1180
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:28,555
We aim to please.
