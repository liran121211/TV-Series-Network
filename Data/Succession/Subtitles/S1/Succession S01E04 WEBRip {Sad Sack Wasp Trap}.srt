1
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,217
Kendall, if the stock drops below 130,

2
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,927
you're in breach
and we want our money back.

3
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,679
Can we start to negotiate?

4
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,267
I know that you said
he wasn't great,

5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,477
but I was passing by,
so I thought I'd pop up.

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,562
I'm afraid that
is out of the question.

7
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,690
No one apart from Marcia
has seen him

8
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,108
for the better part of a week.
Relax.

9
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,442
We don't want to rush the recovery.

10
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,528
Oh, right, 'cause you like playing boss?

11
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,696
You know my brother and I.

12
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,283
CEO and COO, and welcome Tom Wambsgans

13
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,577
who is now sitting up
with the grown-ups.

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,953
Stock's gone below 130.

15
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,040
I've had an idea. You give me
four billion dollars.

16
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:25,919
I stay boss, you invest for once
in a blue chip corporation.

17
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,629
I'm going to need voting stock.

18
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,298
I'm also going to need a board seat.

19
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,550
Yeah, I wouldn't say that I'm the man,
Mm--hmm.

20
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,970
but if there were a man,
he might look a lot like me.

21
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,472
After you went down, the stock tanked.

22
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,890
You took a gamble on that loan.

23
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,226
But I found us a private equity solution.

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,188
You are a fucking idiot.

25
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,744
OK, that's right,

26
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,121
along the edge.

27
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,498
Good. That's good.

28
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,083
Don't patronize me.

29
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,169
Walking's not good.
It's fuckin' normal.

30
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,588
I'm not. That is good,
Mr. Roy.

31
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,673
I need to sit down.

32
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,258
Chair.
Logan,

33
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,594
if you're not well enough
for the charity dinner,

34
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,722
I maybe go with this 
handsome young man.

35
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,390
OK. Now,

36
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,933
this is a little trickier.

37
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,811
This is the proprioception.

38
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,606
That's side to side.

39
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,737
Turn it off.
It's like being inside
a fuckin' commercial.

40
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,204
There you go.

41
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,790
You turn it off yourself.

42
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,083
Come on.

43
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,298
Where the fuck's she goin'?

44
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,110
Thank you.

45
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,329
Rava, hey, did you decide yet

46
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,915
about tomorrow night?
It's kind of a big night for me.

47
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,542
I'm making Dad's RECNY ball speech.

48
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,254
I just kind of assumed
your "hopefully" was a "yes."

49
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,302
Are you serious?

50
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,347
...GDP numbers that showed
the US economy

51
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,474
maintained a brisk pace of growth

52
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,184
at a 2.8% annual rate.

53
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,269
How was L. A.?
Great.

54
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,396
They're all fuckin' nuts, but great.

55
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,774
Can you get onto Lance
about my speech?

56
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,818
And can we get one of
the late night guys to,

57
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,320
you know, cook me up a bit?
A bit?

58
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,532
Yeah, a bit.
You know, a selection 
of jokes and riffs?

59
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,159
You're gonna do a joke?

60
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,621
What does that mean?
I was fuckin' king of the Lampoon.

61
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,207
Kicked their distribution 
into shape.

62
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,125
I cleared your morning because...
Who's that in my dad's...?

63
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,961
because your dad wants to see you.

64
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,921
Guessing you didn't know that.

65
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,592
No, I didn't know.
But, uh...

66
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,761
it's great news. Right?

67
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,223
Did you know?
No, but it's great.

68
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,267
Sure. Oh, sure.

69
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,270
Shouldn't he have told you?

70
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,818
OK, uh, listen, I'll just, um...

71
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,361
get myself straight

72
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,739
and go and see 
the old... fuckin' goat.

73
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,577
OK.

74
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,714
You look good.

75
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,049
Uh, well, yeah.
Well, thank you.

76
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,926
Mm--hmm.

77
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,762
Whoops.
Uh, Grace, um--

78
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,682
OK, see, this is why
your staying here doesn't work.

79
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,101
There are five bathrooms
in this place,and you're here.

80
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,438
Why are you here?
Like, right now
I have to fart, and I'm not.

81
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,357
I'm physically not farting
because you're here.
OK.

82
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,818
I'm just feeling a little
oppressed is all, OK?

83
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,153
Thank you.

84
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,699
Do you want me to speak
to Connor and confirm
table arrangements?

85
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,993
Uh--huh.
We're hosting basically
the same as last year,

86
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,746
plus Joyce and Daniel.
Is that OK?

87
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,415
I didn't go last year, Shiv.

88
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes, you did.

89
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,253
Remember we had that racist
Belgian GS guy?

90
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,088
And his wife who wanted
to kill herself?

91
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,675
Siobhan, I think
I would remember

92
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,595
our first Roy Endowment
Creative New York ball together.

93
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,390
I was trapped in Honk Kong,
scoping out theme parks.

94
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,059
Really?
Yeah. Honey,

95
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,811
growing up I used to look
at the pictures of the RECNY

96
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,813
in Mom's "Vanity Fairs."

97
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,941
And now, a little boy
from St. Paul's going,

98
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,527
with the most beautiful gal
in the world.

99
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,658
Oh, what the fuck?
What?

100
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,870
It's quite a haunting image,

101
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,915
isn't it? The eye almost seems
to follow you around the room.

102
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,583
What is this?

103
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,379
You know, your client,
the future senator? Apparently,

104
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,547
this is her husband's asshole.

105
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,716
What? Fuck off.
Can you prove that?

106
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,304
He posted it himself with the caption:
"Check out my asshole."

107
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,431
It was on a site called Filthy Rich.

108
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,267
Has everybody got it?
Just us, I believe, right now.

109
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,813
Leaked to ATN. My buddy
thought I'd be intrigued.

110
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,980
All right, well, bring it on.

111
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,232
Ooh, feisty.

112
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,358
What, they're not gonna run it?

113
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,818
It's dirty, it's weird,

114
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,196
and it's evidence of precisely the kind

115
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,449
of disgusting liberal metro butt-love

116
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,869
that makes our viewership angry
enough to buy pharmaceuticals.

117
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,789
Oh, OK, fuck you very much.
OK, well,

118
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,958
hate to be the bearer of bad news.

119
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,669
What do we call it,
"an intimate part of his body"?

120
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,004
No! That sounds like his dick.

121
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,882
Or just his "anus"?

122
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,386
"Anus"? At breakfast?

123
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,430
That's a fucking juice-dropper.

124
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,391
"A very private part of his body."

125
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,102
It's boring. And she needs
to get more sleep.

126
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,646
Karen.
Yeah?

127
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,149
You sleepin' OK?
I thought so.

128
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,985
Yeah? Are you sleeping on your face?

129
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,696
Boom! Ouch.
I'm just kidding.

130
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,322
You look great.
How about me, darling?

131
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,782
How do I look?

132
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,909
FIE, Mark.
Fuckable in an emergency.

133
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,163
Now, if we don't call out
this frigid little phony,

134
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,165
who will?

135
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,626
Yeah. Good.

136
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,878
Hey, Dad.

137
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,797
I didn't know you were coming in.

138
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,883
Did--Did Gerri?

139
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,843
Do I need permission?

140
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,636
Hey, come on. Screw you.

141
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,388
Just making sure you're not selling

142
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,348
any more of the company from under me.

143
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,184
Oh, you want to get into that?

144
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,811
You know, you put a hole in us

145
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,938
by taking on a shitload of debt.

146
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,733
But look, this is, uh...

147
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,443
it's great to see you.

148
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,197
Are you sure you're OK?

149
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,701
Maybe you should get a briefing
and get some rest, yeah?

150
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,286
Yeah, OK.

151
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,540
Joseph!

152
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,959
Bring the wheelchair!
I need to take a leak!

153
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,232
Hey. So, uh, Dad's back.

154
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,484
Back where?
Back in the chair?

155
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,819
Seems kind of fast, right?

156
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,737
But, you know, it's good, obviously.

157
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,448
You'd love it if his brain
fell out the back of his head.

158
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,243
Jesus. I'm just scared in case--

159
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,245
You're scared in case
he tries to push you out

160
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:24,582
and your plans for, you know,
Uber for news and Facebook for cats

161
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,668
and open plan office.

162
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,088
You want a dance platform
jerkin' off idea gloop into...

163
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,756
think boxes.

164
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,466
I gotta go.

165
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,510
Roman. Good morning.
Frank.

166
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,596
No, correction, it is not 
a good morning from my POV

167
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,557
because you're here
and I fuckin' hate you.

168
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,100
Oh, come on, kid.

169
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,601
What the fuck is goin' on?

170
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,812
Your dad asked me to come back.

171
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:50,108
Oh, the fuckin'-- the weasel prevails.

172
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,277
That'd be a good name
for your autobiography,

173
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,445
if they did books by jerks.

174
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,114
God, you're pathetic.

175
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,950
He apologized.
Sure, man. Yeah.

176
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,286
He didn't apologize when he hit
our au pair with his car.

177
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,704
He wants me to show you the ropes.

178
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,205
"It was her fault for being too short,"
he said.

179
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,665
OK.

180
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,333
Nothing else?
What do you mean?

181
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,587
I mean, in terms of what went up there.

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,298
Because first it's a finger,
then it's a fist.

183
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,508
then it's a dildo
shaped like Richard Nixon.

184
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,928
Ohh. Fuck this!

185
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,139
A man wouldn't be getting this.

186
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,640
Mm--hmm.

187
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,767
Let's say that.

188
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,520
Yeah, agreed.
Hundred percent.

189
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,148
But for us, now,

190
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,983
this isn't gonna go away,

191
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,985
so we need to be clear,
we need to know the details.

192
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,820
I think you need to talk
to your husband again.

193
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,990
It's not going away because
ATN won't let it go away.

194
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,783
So I think you should
talk to your father.

195
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,009
I just hope the seating plan holds.

196
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,053
If it does...

197
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,096
look out, Middle East,

198
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,807
'cause I can fix anything.

199
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,019
I just want you to know

200
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,022
you're the best damn bunch of people

201
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,815
I ever had the honor to work for.

202
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,275
Thank you very much.

203
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,527
Here he comes.

204
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:20,365
Bill. The best boss that ever lived.

205
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,701
It's like Mandela fucked Santa
and gave birth to Bill.

206
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,203
Thank you, everybody.

207
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,996
Did you hear about Logan?

208
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,581
They say he came in.

209
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,794
Uh, uh--huh.
Yeah, I knew.

210
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,045
But I couldn't say.

211
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,380
Thank you.

212
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,632
Thank you so much.

213
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,677
Come on, you genial old fucker.

214
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,388
Get in here already,
before it's time for me to retire.

215
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,266
Hey, Bill!
Sorry about all that.

216
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,059
No problem, Bill!
I just hope one day

217
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,938
I can eventually inspire
similar affection.

218
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:52,939
Uh, this is,

219
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,565
this is Greg,

220
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,484
new kid I took under my wing
when I started.

221
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,153
Oh.
I'm actually a part of the fam--

222
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,739
Doesn't need to hear
your life story, Greg.

223
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,242
So, uh, thanks for everything.
No.

224
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,078
But listen, before I do
the final photo,

225
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:11,082
there's a... thing I need to mention.

226
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,667
Cool.
You know, just us?

227
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,297
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?

228
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,674
Great to meet you.
Yeah. Thanks for understanding.

229
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,468
Thank you, Bill.
You're welcome.

230
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,806
OK. So, uh...

231
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,060
I've turned off the Wi-Fi, and...

232
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,188
this is, uh... this is air-gapped,

233
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:39,027
so I'm gonna create
a Word document for you,

234
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,820
and then I'm gonna print it,
because I don't want

235
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,239
anything with my handwriting on it.

236
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,741
I think someone has been watching

237
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,369
a few too many spy movies
since they retired, eh, Bill?

238
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,373
Yeah, maybe.

239
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,375
Ah. Here.

240
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,086
This, uh, this is the number

241
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,964
of a set of storage files
in the depository,

242
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,050
and the subject is, well,

243
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,635
something that-- it's not a big deal,

244
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,763
but it needs to be handled,

245
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,973
and, uh... you're in the family.

246
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:13,186
So... this is the name
of the legal office

247
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,520
that is the intermediary,

248
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,483
and this is the person
outside the firm

249
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,235
that we've been using as a firewall

250
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,988
to deal with the blowback 
from the NDAs.

251
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,573
Uh... uh--huh.

252
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,367
It's not a big deal, Tom.

253
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,328
Right, but what is it, Bill?

254
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,913
Well--

255
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,874
You--you have two viable options.

256
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,544
I can tell you everything,
and that's fine.

257
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:42,340
Or I can not tell you,
and... you wouldn't know,

258
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,927
and then you can steer clear
of the whole death pit.

259
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,470
And that would be fine, too.

260
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,555
Uh--huh.
So, I mean,

261
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,392
the nice news is, either way,
both ways, everything is fine.

262
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,229
Just keep the nuclear rods cool,
nothing's gonna blow.

263
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,731
OK, so... there's the death pit,

264
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,859
and at the bottom of the death pit
there's nuclear rods?

265
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,069
Well...

266
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,113
You want to give me
the good news now, Bill?

267
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,783
Um--

268
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,992
Excuse me.

269
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,536
Photographer's ready.
Terrific!

270
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,620
Thanks, Kelly.

271
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,540
And...

272
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,834
print.

273
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,962
OK, you need to tell Dad
to back the fuck off.

274
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,631
Hey, shouldn't you be at
1 OAK or something by now?

275
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,800
You know he rehired Frank
to babysit me?

276
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,386
I don't need a babysitter. OK?
Especially one I don't get to fuck.

277
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,887
Seriously?
Yes.

278
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,681
Frank is back?
Yeah. I mean, you're CEO.

279
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,890
Can he even do that?

280
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,059
I don't--

281
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,310
It's--It's a question.

282
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,395
OK, well, have a talk with him,

283
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,604
tell him to butt out,

284
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,064
because we are running the show now.

285
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,649
Tell him he needs to go back to bed

286
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,276
and eat some soup, get some rest.

287
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,861
Look, relax, OK?

288
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,696
The, uh, you know,

289
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,158
the dinosaur is having
one last roar at the meteor

290
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,201
before it wipes him out.
But look,

291
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,829
hey... you're doing a great job.

292
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,914
Thank you.
Thanks, man.

293
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,545
It's actually good to hear.
It's a big job.

294
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,755
I know it, bro.
Tell me about it.

295
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,757
Do you want some help?
I can help you,

296
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,510
we can tag-team it on Dad's speech
at Sad Sack Wasp Trap.

297
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,180
Um, I guess, yeah,

298
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,432
I mean, it is a CEO thing,

299
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,311
so, I mean, like I have
a whole thing prepared

300
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,980
with jokes, and so-
You're doing jokes?

301
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,107
Why does everyone keep saying that?
I'm funny.

302
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,568
Yup.
I'm sure you're gonna kill it.

303
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,446
Who you taking?
Uh, no one. Rava's busy.

304
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,240
Doesn't want to? Got it.
So maybe I'll roll solo.

305
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,410
How's that gonna look?
CEO can't even get an ugly
sister to go to the ball?

306
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,580
You know who I'd like to take?
Hmm?

307
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,957
Anna Newman.
That blonde chick from ATN?

308
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,543
The bl--Oh, shit, yeah!
I'd fuck that in a minute.

309
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,296
Take her.
It's not cool. I'm her boss.

310
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,883
Oh, come on, what a pathetic beta-cuck.

311
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,177
"Uh, excuse me, uh, would it be cool,

312
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,471
'cause I have something
very secret in my pants.

313
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,890
Would it be OK to show, please?
Or is that a trigger warning?"

314
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,142
Jesus, Roman, you're
a walking fuckin' lawsuit.

315
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,311
Uh, no, I'm honest, I'm just like,

316
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,147
"Hey, I like your face.
I wanna fuck your face.

317
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,482
Can I cum on your face?"

318
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,984
Which is why my face is drowning in pussy

319
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,903
and you're not even fucking your wife.

320
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:14,283
Too far. Eeh!
Sorry, it just--

321
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,910
Ooh, them's the facts.

322
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,962
No, thank you!

323
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,297
Please leave me alone, please!
Thank you!

324
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,512
I--I got it.

325
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,721
Morning.

326
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,974
Morning.

327
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,895
OK. Give me a hand. Yeah.

328
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,148
Uh, personal first,

329
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,734
then the corporal.

330
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,361
Corporate.

331
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,030
Um, OK.

332
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,783
Well, personal, nothing much.

333
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,368
Pre-ball piece,

334
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,537
profiles of endowment recipients,

335
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,163
that's all great,

336
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,207
and just a little piece on your health,

337
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,668
but I don't think you need to hear that.

338
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,836
Say it.

339
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,468
Um, "Kendall Roy will give
the traditional address

340
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,679
at the RECNY charity ball tonight,

341
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,265
in a sign that even after
recovery from his stroke,

342
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:23,769
Logan Roy is intending to wind down
from public duties."

343
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,941
Where did he get that?
Who gave him that?

344
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,236
I--I don't know.
Well, here's an idea:
find out.

345
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,490
Or find some other prick
to pay ya a million a fuckin' year.

346
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,286
OK.

347
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,670
I just gotta tell you, handling the ball,

348
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,047
it's just not a big deal for me,

349
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,632
which is the thing that's so nice.

350
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,259
It is not a big deal.
"Winding down."

351
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,887
Winding fucking down.
I'm winding up.

352
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,598
It's just funny, being in charge.

353
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,642
I remember years ago

354
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,518
I'd be at the table between you and Mom

355
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,813
and we'd look down, 
and there'd be the mayor,

356
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,566
and all the names of old New York,

357
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,902
and you'd whisper in my ear, you'd say,

358
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,614
"That Astor used to be that,
and he ran this

359
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,616
till he SNAFUed that,

360
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,662
and he's porking her, and she's a slut."

361
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:27,625
And it was just... a very lovely time.

362
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,126
Yeah.

363
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,587
Your mom loved all that.

364
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,298
Fuckin' Wasp Trap.

365
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,886
What would you think about me taking
over a little on the foundation?

366
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,472
Could we pivot it away
from sick kids and contemporary dance

367
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,391
and toward tax reform?

368
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,559
Huh?
To be frank, everyone's dancing anyway,

369
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,228
and there are a lot of charities

370
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,647
that cater to sad sacks--
God knows I love 'em,

371
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,692
but hey, what about lending a hand
to stimulate free enterprise?

372
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:56,278
Yeah, well, let's--
let's see how tonight goes, huh?

373
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,949
Yeah.

374
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,076
I don't have time for this shit.

375
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,165
Hey.
Hi.

376
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,752
Uh, so... look,

377
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,463
I want you to call off your dogs.

378
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,674
Mm--hmm.

379
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,801
Because this obsession with Joyce,

380
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,344
it's--it's out of line.

381
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,639
It's sitting very high on your half hour.

382
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,558
Uh--huh.

383
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,228
And it's vindictive.

384
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,605
And actually, it's bad for democracy.

385
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,779
Are you going to respond?

386
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,323
Well, I think it's important to remember

387
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,493
that I'm not the one taking pictures
of my asshole here.

388
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,873
Yeah.

389
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,667
Are you running this because you think
my dad likes this shit?

390
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,129
Oh, he wouldn't put that kind of 
pressure on his people.

391
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,215
OK.

392
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,177
Look, if I could get some nasty little 
tidbits on some other folk,

393
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,636
could you ramp this down?

394
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,722
We're not the only ones running it, Shiv.

395
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,474
It's a hugely popular story.

396
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,726
Yeah, but you're leading it, Eva.

397
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,562
You had a ten-minute "sexpert" segment

398
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,230
on "How to keep your man happy in bed,"

399
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,523
on a news channel.

400
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,901
OK, you've said your piece, so...

401
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,444
and I've listened.

402
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,488
Great.
Great.

403
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,282
Actually, no.
You know what?

404
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,327
I'm saying as her strategist,
this level of attack

405
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,662
begins to reflect on
your professional judgement.

406
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,749
And you need to think about
the future, because this--

407
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,334
this is the old world,

408
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,753
and someday, in this world,
things will change.

409
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,506
You know I wouldn't let any other 
strategist in the building,

410
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,924
let alone this floor.

411
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,842
Well, I am very grateful.

412
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,594
So when we're talking 
professional judgement,

413
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,971
good to bear in mind
that you're only here

414
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,517
because your name matches the one
carved on the building.

415
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,940
OK, last thing.

416
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,441
For the press and comms,

417
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,401
it's clear, right, that I'm CEO.

418
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,570
We hope one day my dad
will be back, we don't know when.

419
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,656
Great. Thank you.
Thanks, guys.

420
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,786
Hey, Kendall.
Stewy's here.

421
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,120
I just put him in the South Tank

422
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,039
in case you want to keep it on the DL.

423
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,793
Hey, Kendall.
Can I grab five?

424
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,044
Uh--huh.

425
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,130
Um, there's something, uh,

426
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,258
something that you don't know about,

427
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,219
and maybe it's probably something that
you don't want to know about.

428
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,098
And, uh...

429
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,308
You know what my dad always said?

430
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,769
He'd say he loved all his employees,

431
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,690
but he particularly loved the guys who ate
the shit for him and he never even knew it.

432
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,650
Got it.

433
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,486
Got it. Excuse me while I get myself
a knife and a fork

434
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,196
and some Hollandaise.

435
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,163
Hey!
Hey, bro.

436
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,207
How's it goin'?

437
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,459
Good. What's up?
So your dad's in?

438
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,752
Yup, he made it in.

439
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,921
Which we were all, uh, delighted about.

440
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,882
You were delighted about?
Sure.

441
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,134
Sure.
What's the story?

442
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,427
No, he's great, you know,

443
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,137
he likes to remind us he's still alive.

444
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,182
It's great to get his take,
but he needs a lot of rest.

445
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,728
Dad. Hey.
Just talkin' about you.
Sir Roy. Logan.

446
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,355
It's just great to see you.
How have you been?

447
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:22,651
So, you're the little schmuck
who owns such a big chunk of me.

448
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:26,363
Dad, it's Stewy.
You guys have met like a million times.

449
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,240
Excuse me barging in,

450
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,035
it's just Gerri told me I have
a meeting with Opalite later...

451
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,747
just to say, "I like it. Buy it."

452
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,957
OK, Ken?
OK, good thought.

453
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,377
Uh, I'll come find you and we can discuss.

454
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,547
Sure, but if I don't see you, I want it.

455
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,925
OK, uh...

456
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,261
Well, it's not necessarily
the best option in the sector,

457
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,932
so, uh, so, yeah, but we can, uh...

458
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,477
I want us into data mining.
Buy it.

459
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,395
It's a really flooded sector, OK?

460
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,481
Lotta hustlers, lots of bullshit.

461
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,899
You know, it's a gold rush.

462
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,442
Oh, yeah.

463
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,236
And who wants gold?

464
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,948
Make them an offer they get excited about.

465
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,743
Make them an offer they want to tell
their wives about at night.

466
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,620
Nice outdated sexism, Dad,

467
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,247
but I'm sure you're all over the data mining.

468
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,624
Hmm.

469
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,464
I'm sorry?

470
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,967
You OK? Dad?

471
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,428
Hey, should I get... someone?

472
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,014
Maybe you should go home. Yeah?

473
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,685
I just, uh... need to piss.

474
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,940
OK.

475
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,902
Great. Well, thanks for sharing,
uh, old guy.

476
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,321
Glad he's gonna go piss.
Uh, sorry. You know.

477
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,823
He's still recovering.
Mm--hmm.

478
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,700
Listen, just technically,

479
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:56,662
and I don't want to sound reductive, Ken,

480
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,124
but... who's in charge right now?

481
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,876
Me. I am.

482
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,379
Legally and effectively.

483
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,583
OK, Rick, thanks for that.

484
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,917
Thank you.

485
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,377
Very useful. Thanks.

486
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,719
Fuck off.

487
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,229
Hey.

488
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:20,162
So, Greg, uh... listen.

489
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,373
I just had a meeting 
with my private attorney,

490
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,752
and, uh...

491
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,296
it seems I have been exposed to a virus.

492
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,382
Oh. Right.

493
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,593
Yeah.

494
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,011
Sit down.

495
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,225
It's a deadly virus.

496
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,935
And, uh...

497
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:47,815
and now... now I'm fucked!

498
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,152
Forever.

499
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,739
It sounds bad.It is bad.

500
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,909
It is. And, uh, 
I kind of need to share it.

501
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,329
But anyone I talk to, uh...

502
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,668
anyone I talk to, I effectively kill.

503
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,212
Here.

504
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,800
That's the death pit, Greg.

505
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,968
Take a look.

506
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,557
I--I mean, I feel like I might not 
like it in the death pit.

507
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,893
Go ahead.

508
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,565
You're family.

509
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,525
Thank you.

510
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:41,034
It's complicated.
Kind of, yeah.
But not really.

511
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,579
For a number of years there was an
unofficial company policy

512
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,540
on the cruise lines that if there was
a serious criminal incident

513
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,042
we would, if possible, sail, not home,

514
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,670
but to a Caribbean or South American port

515
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,881
where there were so-called "friendly"
authorities,

516
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,174
and we could minimize the incident
to avoid negative PR.

517
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,011
Incidents like--
Theft. Sexual assault.

518
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,888
Rape. Murder.

519
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,890
OK. The bad ones.

520
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,808
Yeah.
There's hundreds in there.

521
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,686
You know, the head of cruises
himself, Lester,

522
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,314
would go on these entertainment tours,

523
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,482
meeting the dancers,

524
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:16,570
and extending the contracts
of the ones that would suck him off.

525
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,656
Everyone we could,
we paid off, we hushed up.

526
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,452
But there are emails, 
there's correspondence-- it's ready to blow.

527
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,370
It's a fucking time bomb.

528
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,247
So, what are you-- what are you gonna do?

529
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,957
I don't know!
I don't know!

530
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,168
Because anyone I ask for advice,
I make complicit.

531
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,338
If you know about this stuff, 
you should tell.

532
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,132
But you can't, because you're gonna
spread the virus.

533
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,760
So...

534
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,512
I have the virus, don't I?

535
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,015
OK, Ken, uh...

536
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,976
why don't you grab the Opalite material?

537
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,813
Uh, well, as I explained, Dad,

538
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,692
I think they're kind of
snake oil salesmen, you know?

539
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,570
Like they're the people
who you buy a refrigerator

540
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,697
and their algorithm is sending you, like,

541
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,659
30 ads for more fridges.
Great algo.

542
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,286
Well, you're the business genius
who sold me out

543
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,955
to this fucker,

544
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,748
so I'd like to hear Stewart's thoughts.

545
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,458
OK, I'll get Jess to--

546
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,336
It's a 30--fuckin' second walkaway, son.

547
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,343
Sure.

548
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,263
So, Stewart...

549
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,400
Jess.

550
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,442
Hey, Jess?

551
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,527
Yeah?

552
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,195
Has anyone been--

553
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,989
Uh, your dad came in 
for like two minutes.

554
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,478
What the--

555
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,189
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

556
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,163
Just like gone in--

557
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,582
Hey.

558
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,835
So, I think we're buyin'.

559
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,795
Good with you, Stewart?

560
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,672
You're the boss.

561
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,718
All good?

562
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,892
Stewart, are you goin' to
the Sad Sack Wasp Trap tonight?

563
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,853
The...
He means the RECNY ball.

564
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,898
Oh. Yes. I am. I'm sorry to hear that
you're not gonna make it.

565
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,816
Oh, no, no,
I'll be there.

566
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,152
Well, I'm payin' for the fuckin' thing,

567
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,945
so I might as well go.

568
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,572
Yeah.

569
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,784
You sure it was him?

570
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,078
You think a lot of people
come in here and take a piss?

571
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,954
Maybe someone spilled something.

572
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,665
Yeah, maybe the massive 
fucking ice sculpture

573
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,751
I forgot about melted.
It's urine.

574
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,836
This isn't a false flag, is it?

575
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,172
Did you piss on your own floor?

576
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,675
Why are you looking like that?
What--What if people knew?

577
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,970
Gerri, you gotta talk to him.
What do you want me to say?

578
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,932
Well, first tell him
where to go pee-pee and poo-poo.

579
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,809
He came in, he was talking to Stewy.

580
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,769
What's he gonna do next,
start jizzing in my coffee?

581
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,521
Take a dump on my iPad?

582
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,897
He's still in recovery mode.

583
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,398
If he thinks he's OK to come back,

584
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,983
he should talk to you, Gerri,

585
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,361
and the nominating committee,
and set a date. Right?

586
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,280
Well, technically, but it's 
kind of a gray area because--

587
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,866
He says he's coming tonight.
You're kidding.

588
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,910
OK, well, that's a concern,
because obviously

589
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,079
with major investors and press on hand..

590
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,040
Yeah, I know.
What if he freaks out?

591
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,042
What if he falls asleep in his soup?

592
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,128
What if he starts 
shouting racist comments?

593
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,088
Just another Saturday night, baby.

594
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,466
We have a fiduciary dutynot to let
the company look, uh, nuts.

595
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,802
What did you do, Kendall,
when you realized he'd done this?

596
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,889
What did I do?
Yeah. How did you respond?

597
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,642
I--I don't know, I didn't want
to humiliate him.

598
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,811
Hmm.
What?

599
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,778
This would be the third injection
I've given you in a month.

600
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,864
He feels he needs to be there.

601
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,116
You're only meant 
to have three in a year.

602
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,742
No wonder you're not sleeping.

603
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,579
You're risking long-term nerve damage.

604
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,124
Jab.
Not jabber.

605
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,459
Shut up and shoot up.

606
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,674
Sweetie? Really do with some advice.

607
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,260
Yeah?
So, look, I don't--

608
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,180
I don't wanna get you into this, but, um,

609
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:56,224
well, Bill told me,
as part of the handover,

610
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,852
where some of the bodies were buried.
Mm--hmm?

611
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,688
And, uh, they're not 
very well-buried bodies,

612
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,274
and they're not really 
even bodies, they're...

613
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,401
kind of zombies?


614
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,280
They're ready to rise up
from the dead at any moment

615
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,240
and kill me.
Uh--huh?

616
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,202
I'm worried that if-- if it does come out,

617
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,787
and it's sort of-- it's kind of bound
to come out,

618
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,956
and it's while I'm in charge, I'm dead,

619
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,042
because I know, and I'm not doing anything.

620
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,878
But if I do do something, I've gotta, 
you know, do something.

621
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,881
Right.
And I'd like to,

622
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,133
you know, not-- obviously not carry the can,

623
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,135
but maybe do the right thing.

624
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,595
OK.

625
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,430
And what is the right thing?

626
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,057
Well, what I'm thinking...

627
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,850
is a press conference.

628
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,061
Oh? OK.
Yeah. And tell--

629
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,314
Get everybody in, tell all the 
top execs and the law guys,

630
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,066
and we go public.

631
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:49,152
Open investigation, 
disinfectant of sunlight,

632
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,821
and, you know, we pin the rap

633
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,491
on a tight group of naughty,
rotten apples.

634
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,326
Oh. OK.

635
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,203
Uh--huh?
Well, that sounds brave.

636
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,164
Yes. Right.
Is that good?


637
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,999
Uh... I'm sorry, can we circle back?

638
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,626
I just--I gotta take this from Joyce.

639
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,171
Yeah?

640
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,839
Look, I did what I can.

641
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,341
It's dropping down the running order.

642
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,760
But long-term, you gotta ask yourself,

643
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,679
will your husband's dirty pink asshole

644
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,307
go nicely with that lovely white house
on Pennsylvania Avenue?

645
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,610
Wave, Roman!

646
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,851
Wait for me.

647
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,520
Thank you.

648
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,400
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm OK.

649
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,111
All right. OK.


650
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,822
You're OK?

651
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,578
I don't think I can do this.

652
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,495
Yes, you can.

653
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,581
Vas--y and fuck them.

654
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,375
OK. Let's go.

655
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,769
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

656
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,312
Excuse me!

657
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,980
OK, what the hell is this?

658
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,398
Uh, fork?

659
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,109
Forks are to be placed thusly.

660
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,321
This is how they do it
at a Dakota dude ranch.

661
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,114
This is how we do it at the RECNY ball.

662
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,533
Now, please go check every other fork.

663
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,120
It's unbelievable.

664
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:07,624
Now, why is everyone standing
on this side of the room?

665
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,168
The room is growing lopsided.

666
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,796
Let's lead them.
What?

667
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,131
Like sheep, Willa, 
let's lead them like sheep.

668
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,926
Go around this way and corral them.
Corral them this way, OK?

669
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,969
I'm gonna go this way.
OK. OK.

670
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,721
Hello! Everyone!

671
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,932
Everyone! Hi!
Come on, everybody,

672
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,309
I'm sorry to interrupt, 
you all look fabulous,

673
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,853
I just want to say if you're having
trouble getting a drink over there,

674
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,563
identical bar over here...

675
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,440
If you could just go to this side.

676
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,526
Enjoy the space, there's acres of it.
So have a good time.

677
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,820
The signature cocktail?
Too avant-garde.

678
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,571
The servers are creating bottlenecks.

679
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,657
They put pesto in the gin-- 
it's a disaster.

680
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,200
There's no flow, Stephanie.

681
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,035
The evening is congealing--
there is no flow. OK?

682
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:47,997
...Mark Morris, 
yeah, so my dad's first wife

683
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,333
thought she was gonna,
you know, empty the ghettos

684
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,670
and get everyone into ballet
when they started this thing.

685
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,714
Yeah.
So patronizing.

686
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,507
What are you drinking?

687
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,009
Uh, a white wine.

688
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,386
Can we get a white wine?

689
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,680
A couple of the kids who got
into New York City Ballet

690
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,974
still send us cards at Christmas,

691
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,017
because that's nice or whatever.

692
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,145
No, it's nice.

693
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,938
Yeah. It's, uh...

694
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,691
it's dumb, but it's cool.

695
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,317
Can I have a bitters and soda?

696
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,197
I'm actually kind of nervous 
about the speech.

697
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,991
Are you?
Yeah.

698
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,869
Maybe you can, uh, give me some pointers.

699
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:29,748
You're the ATN pro, actually.


700
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,917
Good, good.

701
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,961
Is that too wry?

702
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,964
About our good works?
Is that, like, snitty?

703
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,508
Uh, well, there's all this,

704
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,552
like, three pages of, you know,

705
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,430
about you and the family, and the 
good works, and the big hearts,

706
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,557
and on and on and on.

707
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,395
Excusing you, but I didn't ask
for editorial comment.

708
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,689
Now it's into Kendall, OK,

709
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,399
and he's all blah blah blah.

710
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,567
Hold on, pal.
What is this?

711
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,611
Roll that back.
What is that?

712
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,488
What?

713
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,240
"Surprise Logan retirement announcement."
Uh, yeah.

714
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,493
That came through late.
He said he'd just wing it.

715
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,289
OK.

716
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,584
Mr. Bond.

717
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,586
I've been expecting you.
How are ya?

718
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,087
Where are you sitting, man?

719
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,506
Um...
In the basement?

720
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,174
Out by the dumpsters?

721
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,092
Maybe you-- do you want to trade?

722
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,552
Maybe you'll meet a wealthy widow

723
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,638
and you can seduce her with your sad eyes.

724
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,182
She can keep you as a pet in Westchester.

725
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,434
Hi, guys.
Hey.

726
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,270
You look nice this evening.
As do you.

727
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,439
Thank you. So, Tom,

728
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,690
I hear you're thinking about

729
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,692
holding a little press conference?

730
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,863
You know about that?
I don't know anything.

731
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,494
Right. I just think it's the best
thing to do-- Tom, you need to shut up.

732
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,788
This isn't the time to get your 
conscience out and shout,

733
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,748
"Hey, look at me!
I cannot tell a lie!

734
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,792
I'm a good little boy,
look at my ding-dong."

735
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,920
OK, I don't think that's a fair 
characterization of what I'm--

736
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,797
Have you ever heard of the Sin Cake Eater?

737
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,675
No.
He would come to the funeral

738
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,470
and he would eat all the little cakes
they laid out on the corpse--

739
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,556
he ate up all the sins.

740
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,267
And you know what?
The Sin Cake Eater was very well paid.

741
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,812
And so long as there was another one 
who came along after he died,

742
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,605
it all worked out.

743
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,233
So, this may not be the best situation,

744
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,695
but there are harder jobs,
and you get a fuckload of cake.

745
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,906
Can I ask you where 
you heard about this, please?

746
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,827
Tom, it's tough to have to tell you
like this,

747
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,496
but I'm in a sexual relationship
with your mother.

748
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,707
She talks in her sleep.

749
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,301
Excuse me.

750
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,678
Hey. Hey, Pa, how ya doin'?

751
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,848
Just wanted to check in on something.

752
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:55,101
Just wanted to check that you're aware of
Kendall announcing

753
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,103
your retirement this evening?

754
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,479
I mean, I'm sure you were,

755
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,939
but I just wanted to triple-check.

756
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,568
What?
Yeah. Is that right?

757
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,194
No.
No?

758
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,196
Is it a mistake?
Because Kendall's gonna say it.

759
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,615
It's on the teleprompter.

760
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,952
There's been a change of plan.

761
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,165
Kendall's not speaking.

762
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,541
I am.

763
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,459
OK, good.

764
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,719
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

765
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,638
I'm your host, Mark Ravenhead,

766
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,640
and welcome to the RECNY ball.

767
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,810
Hey. Hey!

768
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,687
The butter's too cold!

769
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,606
The butter is too cold!

770
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,234
The butter's all fucked!
You're fuckwads and you fucked it!

771
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,154
There's dinner rolls ripping
out there as we speak!
Connor!

772
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,948
Connor.
I am a laughingstock!

773
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,575
There are always issues
when you serve this many people,

774
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,577
but I think, on the whole,

775
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,955
it's going very well.

776
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,706
Complacent! You're fired!

777
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,834
You're all fired! Idiots!

778
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:06,089
Can't fuckin' believe it.
Surrounded by imbeciles!

779
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,550
Hey. Come with me.
Come with me.

780
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,052
Come on.

781
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,268
You lump of fucking turducken.
Hi, T--Tom.

782
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,770
Did you squeal?
What?

783
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,730
Did you bitch me out, pig man?

784
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,650
As in--
You bleated about 
the fuckin' press conference.

785
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,693
No!
Yes, you did.

786
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,486
No, I did not!
Yes, you did,

787
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,862
you filthy piece of shit.

788
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,906
I ought to drag you into the kitchens

789
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,366
and have them boil you until you're s--

790
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,994
My God, you just touch me, Greg?

791
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,913
Tom, I'm sor--Your spittle
was actually, like--

792
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,957
This is extraordinary.
What are we gonna do about this?

793
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,792
Are these assaults going to be ongoing?

794
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,378
No!
You tell me you didn't do it?

795
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,879
I promise, I swear to God!

796
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,965
Then who the fuck did, then, Greg?

797
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,009
Because I only told you.

798
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,218
Believe me, man...

799
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,889
Fuck off.

800
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,433
...revolutionizing Internet radio

801
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,226
to his work with local children.

802
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,812
Ladies and gentlemen,

803
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,897
please welcome Juno Hernandez!

804
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,871
Hey, Dad.
Mm.

805
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,916
Um, so I don't want 
to shit-talk Kendall, uh--

806
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,918
he ain't up to the job--

807
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,755
but, uh, I think I speak
for everyone here

808
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,381
when I say it's great to see you back.

809
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,675
Ah, thank you, son.
Yeah.

810
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,219
But one thing, um,

811
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,097
and I don't mind, it's fine,

812
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:41,851
but I do want to say that
Frank is what to me, now?

813
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,062
He's vice-chairman,

814
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,355
and you're general advisor.

815
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,941
And why is that?

816
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,279
What's the situation with the park numbers?

817
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,739
Park numbers?
Mm--hmm.

818
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,699
Attendances are good,

819
00:42:56,783 --> 00:43:00,036
but the occupied room nights
are down on last year.

820
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,955
I'm just waiting for Tom 
to get his feet, like,

821
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,540
fully under the table.

822
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:08,086
The guy is a flake,
is actually the truth of it,

823
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,712
but I'm on it. I'm on it.

824
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,881
When are you
coming back in again?

825
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,716
You need to soak up
Frank's experience.

826
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,384
OK, but what does that mean?

827
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,930
It means do what
he fuckin' tells ya.

828
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,848
So sorry about the butter, guys.

829
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,105
There was a problem with the butter?

830
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,524
Frozen.
Oh.

831
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,193
So remember, texting is encouraged tonight.

832
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,319
Please, no sexting,

833
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,072
uh, but texting is fine...

834
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,698
Governor. Watching you.

835
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,325
Let's get those numbers in.

836
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,369
I want to see everybody's name
up on that screen,

837
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,287
and on behalf of everyone here at RECNY,

838
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,997
thank you for your donation.

839
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,630
Hi.

840
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,675
Oh, uh, no. Hold on.

841
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,012
Ahh.

842
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,100
Thaaaank you.

843
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,394
Ah--ah--ah--ah.
You stick around.

844
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,069
Oh, I'm sorry, am I interrupting
something?

845
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,572
If you like her so much, why don't you 
just ask for her fuckin' number?

846
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,283
Rome--
No. I mean,

847
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,952
you clearly want to, right?

848
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,872
Grace, would you like
to give this man your number?

849
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:28,249
Yeah. I'd like to give him my number.

850
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,211
Why don't you ask for her number, then?

851
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,634
Can I get your number?

852
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,471
Can I have a pen, please?

853
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,558
Oh, OK. Here we go.
Yeah. It's happenin'.

854
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,601
That's handy.

855
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,271
That's actually her number.

856
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,107
Hmm. Wait, wait, wait.

857
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,692
Bup--bup--bup--bup--

858
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,407
And fetch another bottle,please. 
Thank you.

859
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,913
Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Fritz.
Good to see you.

860
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,498
Nice work, bro.
What do you mean?

861
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,709
You know, fuckin' the talent.

862
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,045
Hey. Come on.
No! It's cool It's cool.

863
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,214
You're fuckin' ATN, ATN's fuckin' me--

864
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,467
it's a little fucking clusterfuck, yeah?

865
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:25,932
Hey.

866
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,767
Hi.
Everything good?

867
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,519
Yes, I'm having a lovely time.

868
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,812
Thanks.

869
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,192
So sorry about the butter.

870
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,777
And just so you know,

871
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,320
apparently, Dad's going
to be doing the speech now,

872
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,697
so late change of plans,
I hope that's cool.

873
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,575
What--
Well, yeah, he just said.

874
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,994
I guess that put a spoke
in quite a few wheels, huh?

875
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,913
Con. Con.
He's in no fit state.

876
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,623
Gotta go backstage.

877
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,003
Uh, Gerri. Gerri.
Can we talk?

878
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,088
Sure.

879
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:01,717
Over here.

880
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,302
Uh--

881
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,307
Uh, Dad wants to do the speech.

882
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,601
OK. I did not know that.

883
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:14,397
Yeah. When he opens his mouth,
anything could come out.

884
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,357
Drool, anti-Semitism,

885
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,568
fucking string of silk handkerchiefs
tied together.

886
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,404
I mean, if--

887
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,614
if he fucks up publicly,

888
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,366
we have a major problem.

889
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,702
Right.
You need to talk to him.

890
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,332
OK. Got it.
OK? OK.

891
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,925
Lasagna? 
Did you know they had some lasagna?

892
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,678
Would you like some?
Oh, yeah.

893
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,097
Hey.
Hmm.

894
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,808
You good?
I'm good.

895
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,018
Great.

896
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,233
Good luck tonight.

897
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,152
Gonna knock it out of the park.

898
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,361
Thank you.

899
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,663
Good luck.

900
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,417
Bon chance.

901
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,918
Best foot forward.

902
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,003
You can do it.

903
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,214
Good luck.
Thanks.

904
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,633
Nervous?
Not too bad.

905
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:27,887
I had a thing with the butter,
but... seems to be OK.

906
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,474
Where you from?
Bushwick.

907
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,309
Indeed. Yes, indeed.

908
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:36,395
Well, wonderful.
Great effort.

909
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,647
Connor Roy.

910
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,942
People have a lot of preconceptions
about me, too.

911
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,153
It's difficult.

912
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,198
I mean, not... like
I'm sure everything is for you,

913
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,450
but, you know.
Right.

914
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,243
See, I actually have this idea

915
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,995
that social equality could be effected

916
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,289
by a complete eradication of federal support.

917
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,084
Just people like you and I, 
doin' it together,

918
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,503
fighting it out without
all the bullshit--OK, this is me.

919
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,171
Great! Break a leg, my friend.

920
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,125
That was great.

921
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,429
Hey, you.

922
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,972
Good job, Con.

923
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,223
Best event of the fall.

924
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,725
Thanks, man.
Really.

925
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,518
Hey, terrific evening, huh?

926
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:43,772
You really showed it to those
cystic fibrosis fuckheads, huh?

927
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:46,942
Well, it's all about the charity. 
It's not about me, buddy.

928
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,235
You're right.
OK, thanks.

929
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,239
Hey! Hey, you guys!

930
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,325
You won't believe what people
are saying out there.

931
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,993
It's amazing!
We tore it up.

932
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,579
We nailed it, man!
Score, team RECNY!

933
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,789
You're awesome, dude.
You're awesome, awesome, awesome.

934
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,792
I love you so much.
Everyone, you're amazing
and I love you so much.

935
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,045
Stephanie, my rock!

936
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,380
Come on, bring it.
Come on, come on, come on.

937
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,636
Business mogul, philanthropist,

938
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,640
and guy whose name is on all of my checks...

939
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,434
ladies and gentlemen,

940
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,811
it is my profound pleasure

941
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,981
to introduce to you, on this 
most  auspicious of occasions...

942
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:31,362
...in a change to advertised attractions,

943
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,156
the man, the legend--

944
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,950
Logan Roy!

945
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:40,204
Ooh. Elvis. I thought
we were getting a supporting act.

946
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:53,384
Keep going.

947
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,469
Just get to Dan

948
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,596
and pretend you're talking.

949
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,852
There's a $40 billion market cap

950
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:06,063
waiting to see if he makes it.

951
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,525
If he falls, I'm gonna lose
one of my several houses,

952
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,318
and you're gonna pay for the next one.

953
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,824
My God, he's really milking the walk.

954
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,118
Nearly there.
Come on.

955
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,510
Thank you. Um...

956
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,887
uh... evening.

957
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,682
First, I'd, uh,

958
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:45,603
I'd like to thank my wife, 
Marcia, for, uh...

959
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:46,854
everything.

960
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,983
Thank you.

961
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,069
Uh, thanks,

962
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,988
thanks to you all for coming,

963
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,241
and thanks to those who have supported me

964
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,827
during my recent

965
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,080
health nonsense.

966
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,750
Head cold.

967
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,961
Yeah, uh, yeah, that's, uh, yeah.

968
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,631
So...

969
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,466
personal n--news.

970
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:22,264
Someone took advantage

971
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:26,894
of me being in the hospital,

972
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,980
to...

973
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:33,859
propose...

974
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,444
to my daughter.

975
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,447
So I'd like to take this opportunity

976
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:43,702
to welcome her fiance,
Tom Wamsgans, to the family.

977
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,537
Welcome to the family, Tom.

978
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:51,251
It's so, so important

979
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:56,382
that children are supported and encouraged.

980
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,385
And, uh...

981
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,430
everything I've done,

982
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,974
I've done for my children.

983
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:09,144
And I'm proud of the way

984
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:12,314
that they've pulled together

985
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,650
during my issue.

986
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:18,237
And, in particular,

987
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,115
my son... Kendall.

988
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,370
Well done, Ken.

989
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,625
And now

990
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:35,254
for one last announcement of the night.

991
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,590
I'm officially announcing...

992
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,012
...I'm back.

993
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,308
You better believe, I'm back.

994
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,228
Fulltime...

995
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,939
better than ever.

996
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,649
Thank you.

997
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:56,984
All right!

998
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,485
Thank you!

999
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,286
Get me out of here.
Logan Roy, everybody!

1000
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,760
Yeah, nice one.
Way to go, Dad.

1001
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,887
Why would you do that? Huh?

1002
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,930
I see you.

1003
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,975
I spied you fuckin' out, son.
Don't ever do that to me again.

1004
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,811
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1005
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,397
Retire me, shoot me like a dog 
in the street.

1006
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,441
I heard about your little speech.

1007
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,944
My speech? I was gonna do one fuckin'
joke about how you'd never retire.

1008
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,405
Bullshit!

1009
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:46,033
Why didn't you just talk to me?

1010
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,326
Fuck off.

1011
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:54,166
OK, OK. Pa.
You're all right.

1012
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,959
OK. Thanks, Mark.

1013
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,045
Here. Easy, easy. Yeah.

1014
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,840
You OK?

1015
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,301
Yeah. Oh!
Hey, Connor.

1016
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,220
You did well tonight.

1017
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,097
I'm really, really proud of you.

1018
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,766
I can no longer obey, Dad.

1019
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,852
"I have tasted command, 
and I cannot give it up."

1020
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:17,940
A certain artillery cadet
by the name of N. Bonaparte.

1021
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,235
Are you OK?

1022
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,779
Let's go.
OK, let's go.

1023
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,114
Yeah. OK.

1024
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,159
Good night. Good job.

1025
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:30,577
Thank you.

1026
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,834
Hey.

1027
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,425
You know, look, Anna...

1028
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,803
can I just ask...

1029
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:51,181
is there something... going on here?

1030
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,642
As in?
I don't know,

1031
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:57,020
is there an atmosphere?
Did I say something to offend you?

1032
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,523
This has been a lovely evening.

1033
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,316
I was so happy to come.

1034
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,486
So, am I crazy?

1035
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,822
I feel like I'm on a date with an app.

1036
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,450
Like there's this invisible bubble wrap.

1037
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,079
Look, um...

1038
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,708
off the record,

1039
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,167
off off,

1040
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,670
you seem like a nice... guy.

1041
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:22,963
Thank you.

1042
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,882
Eva told me to come.

1043
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,801
Asked. I mean,

1044
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,345
I asked her to just, 
you know, ask your people.

1045
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,222
It's fine.

1046
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,349
I'm just seeing someone,

1047
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,893
but y--you--you're the boss.

1048
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,396
No. No, no, no.
I'm--I'm not that guy.

1049
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,190
Yeah, sure. No. I'm--

1050
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:45,235
But actually, you are the guy.
Right now.

1051
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,573
What did she say? Eva?

1052
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,866
Nothing.

1053
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,534
Come on. Please, just--

1054
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:57,623
To make sure that you had
a really good time.

1055
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,458
Was she joking?

1056
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,209
Sure.

1057
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:05,172
OK, uh, and I'd prefer it

1058
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,965
if you didn't say anything.

1059
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,595
Well, uh, I think I should.

1060
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,096
Please don't.

1061
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,640
OK. Sure.

1062
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:21,021
Hey, come on, man.
This is our charity.

1063
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,066
How much a plate?
You gotta get at least a blow job.

1064
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,484
That's the law.

1065
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,112
That's not the law.

1066
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,114
Well, it's the ethical code, then,

1067
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,532
and I hate to say this,

1068
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,493
but she's behaved rather unethically here.

1069
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,310
Hey.

1070
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,521
Had a really good time.

1071
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,487
Good kid.
Smart move.

1072
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,240
Keep talking.

1073
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,325
I aim to please, ma'am.

1074
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,162
Did you tell him to call?

1075
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,378
Don't wake him up.

1076
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:09,755
Please close the door.

1077
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,006
Keep driving.

1078
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,758
I want him to sleep.

1079
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,655
Hey, hey, hey.

1080
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,973
Happy Thanksgiving, Grandpa.

1081
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,560
Not for the Indians.
Nope. That is... still true.

1082
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,270
They only way he'll respect you

1083
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,063
is if you try to destroy him,
because in your position,

1084
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,189
that is exactly

1085
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,899
what he would try to do.

1086
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,818
Are you thinking of moving
against your dad?

1087
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,695
If he's not careful 
he's gonna destroy the company.

1088
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,363
Ever hear of loyalty?

1089
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,574
Sure, wasn't he one of the seven dwarves?

1090
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,617
Everything isn't about money.

1091
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,244
It could get you a fuckin' lot.

1092
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,288
We're eating family style.

1093
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,873
What?
Almost like we're a family.

1094
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,257
I just hope the seating plan holds.

1095
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,719
If it does, look out, Middle East,

1096
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,430
'cause I can fix anything.

1097
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:29,936
Connor's the... not full sibling
of the other three kids.

1098
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,022
He's from Logan's first marriage,

1099
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,024
and he's always been slightly dismissed.

1100
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,901
What would you think about me taking over

1101
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:36,985
the London foundation?

1102
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,237
Let's see how tonight goes, huh?

1103
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:40,363
Yeah.

1104
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:44,409
When he does get offered
a little bit of capital

1105
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:48,079
in the family by being invited
to run this charity ball,

1106
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,248
he grabs that with both hands and dives in.

1107
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,334
Forks are to be placed thusly.

1108
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,337
This is how they do it 
at a Dakota dude ranch.

1109
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,505
This is how we do it at the RECNY Ball.

1110
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:59,257
Now, please go check every other fork.

1111
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:03,637
What happened in episode 104 is
that's the kind of thing

1112
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,806
that would have fallen 
to Marcia, and she's so busy

1113
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,350
with helping Dad rehabilitate.

1114
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,268
I think they just called up and they said,

1115
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,770
"Look, would you take care of this?"

1116
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,104
'Cause the other kids 
aren't going to do it.

1117
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:16,524
Now why is everyone standing
on this side of the room?

1118
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:17,734
Willa, let's lead them like sheep.

1119
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,194
Go around this way and corral them,

1120
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,445
corral them this way.

1121
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,239
Connor excels in a situation

1122
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:24,741
that he never thought he'd excel in.

1123
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,242
I just wanna say, if you're having trouble

1124
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:29,162
getting a drink over there,
identical bar over here.

1125
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,581
And it kind of liberates Connor in a way,

1126
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,917
because he's never gone into that world,

1127
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,462
so he found a way in
from being the party organizer.

1128
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,590
The butter's too cold!
The butter is too cold!

1129
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:43,009
There's dinner rolls 
ripping out there as we speak!
Connor!

1130
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,221
Hero Kendall, he thinks this is his moment,

1131
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,431
'cause he thinks the father 
is gonna retire.

1132
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,266
Who's in charge right now?
Me.

1133
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,560
And at the RECNY Ball, I've been asked

1134
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:55,730
to make the speech, 
which is kind of a huge honor,

1135
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,190
and a bit of a right of passage.

1136
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,733
You're aware of Kendall announcing

1137
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,360
your retirement this evening?

1138
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:02,988
Dad has a fear of not being in control

1139
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:05,657
when there's a lot of power
and a lot of money involved.

1140
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,242
There's been a change of plan.

1141
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,078
Kendall is not speaking. I am.

1142
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,580
My father blindsides me,

1143
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,666
makes the speech without telling me,

1144
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,585
and then announces that
he's actually not retiring.

1145
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:20,672
I'm officially announcing
I'm back.

1146
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:22,465
Better than ever!

1147
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:26,136
Once again, he cuts 
my legs out from under me.

1148
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,847
There's only so much of that
I think a person can take.
