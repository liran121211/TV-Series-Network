1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:01,485
Who's this guy, Alon?

2
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,519
A very highly regarded corporate therapist.

3
00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:04,769
It'll be a very compelling package.

4
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:06,917
A family reunited in the desert.

5
00:00:07,793 --> 00:00:09,852
Sandy Furness is here.
He can't do that.

6
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,710
Pepsi doesn't just drop in to see Coke.

7
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:13,686
How about you give me four billion dollars?

8
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,084
I stay boss, you invest,
happy ending for all.

9
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,102
What I think we should really
have a conversation about

10
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:21,519
is the fact that Kendall's not here,

11
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:24,477
and there are reports of him
running around taking drugs.

12
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,561
I had nothing to do with those stories.

13
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:27,602
Do you believe your father?

14
00:00:27,626 --> 00:00:29,710
No, I think this whole thing is fake.

15
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:31,519
I genuinely believe he's going to be

16
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:32,893
the next president of the United States,

17
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:34,727
and Gil could really use someone like you.

18
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,686
The question is, do you want this enough

19
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,293
to go to war with your family?

20
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:40,435
It's rebellion. Sabotage.

21
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:43,727
You run towards politics to
prove that you're your own man.

22
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,852
You're a fucking coward.
Wow.

23
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:48,626
What up, motherfuckers?
What are we arguing about?

24
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,727
You're so fucking jealous

25
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,227
of what you've given your own kids.

26
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,686
Calling your daughter
a coward 'til she cries?

27
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,751
Big man.
Logan!

28
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,501
You are a fucking nobody.

29
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,668
It's a pretty great view, huh?

30
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,959
I mean, out there. Not me.

31
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:57,209
Where are we at, Bob?

32
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:03,876
Excuse me, I I'm actually not even here.

33
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:09,352
You're at 5.3?
Correct.

34
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:10,644
And I think

35
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,852
we can live with that.

36
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:13,935
Yeah?

37
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:15,852
Yeah.

38
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:18,893
Uhhuh.
It's a fair price.

39
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:20,310
Well, I don't know about that.

40
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,060
You'll have 70 local TV stations.

41
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:25,561
Buy in Sandy, you're King Kong of local.

42
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:29,001
The kid knows. The kid's smart.

43
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,209
Are we good?

44
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:37,852
Give us five minutes.

45
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:40,376
We'll set you up with a room.

46
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:00,269
Good, right? Is it whiskey time?

47
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:02,310
Shut the fuck up.

48
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:05,185
Uh, it's a good price.
What the fuck's going on?

49
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,686
He's selling me things
I want at a fair price?

50
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,102
So what's next? Fellatio?

51
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,602
I think he just wants out, fast.

52
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:15,602
If he does, we fuck him.

53
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:17,751
I think we did just fuck him.

54
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:20,769
He's smiling.

55
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,185
It's no good if he's smiling.

56
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:24,269
Well, objectively,

57
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:25,561
I mean, if we get what we want

58
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:27,435
and he gets what he wants.

59
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,519
You screw them out.

60
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,852
You chisel them out.

61
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:31,477
You fuckin' hurt them.

62
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,977
And then you watch them squeal.

63
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,686
I like hurting human beings
as much as the next guy,

64
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,935
but, Dad, this is really fucking good.

65
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,143
Walk him to the elevator and tell him 4.9.

66
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:45,477
Oh, Dad, no, that's it's insulting.

67
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:48,185
Walk him to the elevator and tell him 4.9.

68
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,477
Gerri, you do it.

69
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:50,852
You, fuck off.

70
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:52,977
If you can't do it, fuck off!

71
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,227
All right.

72
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:57,167
Just text on your phone, ya bendy fuck.

73
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,269
Really just warms the walls.

74
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:02,686
Greg.
Hey.

75
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,686
Ow! Dude.
Yo. Whoa whoa.

76
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,561
Yeah, yeah.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

77
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:08,935
Are you OK?

78
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,018
What? Oh, that? That was nothing.

79
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:12,769
Sometimes you gotta play possum, ya know?

80
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,435
Let him punch it out till he gets tired,

81
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:15,977
and then you go in for the kill.

82
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,727
Right, nice. Listen, hold on.

83
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,352
Yeah.
How's Kendall doin'?

84
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,018
He's blowing you off too?

85
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:23,561
Last time I saw him he was
smoking crank with some mole men,

86
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,227
but that was like a month ago.

87
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:27,893
He's hustlin'. Yeah, right. VCing?

88
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:30,018
I may be seeing him
this weekend. If he shows.

89
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,102
Oh, yeah?
Aw, fuck.

90
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:35,352
Dude, I don't suppose you know
a coke dealer in Prague, do you?

91
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,435
Ah, probably. Yeah. Why?

92
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,310
Tom Wams' bachelor party.

93
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:42,102
"And if he doesn't show"
I don't have time for this.

94
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:46,602
Hey, let me tell you
something, dude. Fuck Prague.

95
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:49,310
My girlfriend and her fuckin' freak dogs

96
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:52,143
run these. You ever heard
of these parties, Rhomboid?

97
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,561
Bullshit.

98
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:54,727
I'm tellin' ya. I'm fuckin' cool.

99
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:56,018
You don't understand.

100
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,394
Why, because you have a nipple ring

101
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,185
and simply will not stop going on about it?

102
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,811
It's better than telling
everyone you're down with Dre

103
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,769
because he sends you
cereal bars at Christmas.

104
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:04,227
Fuck you. I have a reputation.

105
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,977
I can't take my crew
to watch some art pricks

106
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,977
dance around in bowler hats
and twizzle their mustaches

107
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,602
out of time to the beats.

108
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:11,561
Are you done? You know
who else will be there?

109
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:13,018
Sandy Furness.

110
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,769
Fuck off.

111
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:15,977
I'm tellin' you.

112
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,727
Bleahh. He goes to that kind of thing?

113
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,310
I know, right? But he is sitting

114
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:23,394
on the other half of your dad's dream deal.

115
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,935
Packet of 50 more local stations.

116
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,310
Come to the party, get him to sell,

117
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:31,644
and trust me when I say this,

118
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:34,893
you will become the number one son.

119
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:36,644
Sandy... goes? Jesus.

120
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:38,935
Yeah. Get me those names
and I'll get you on that list.

121
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,394
Bring Kendall, OK?

122
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:44,310

Nice and loose, yeah, Frank?
Yeah.

145
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:33,143
Try not to drag yourself in there

146
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,959
like the world's oldest man.

147
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,477
I'll try.

148
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,602
Frank. Kendall.

149
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,811
This is Dust.
Hey, man.

150
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:44,769
Hey. Great to connect.

151
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:48,310
Love the name, by the way. Very... funky.

152
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,352
Sorry, please excuse
Captain fuckin' BeBop here.

153
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:52,602
Hey, how's it goin'?

154
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:54,602
Cool earrings. Very Bauhaus.

155
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:56,394
Big fan of what you guys do.

156
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:58,561
Fuckin' sweet chili sauce.

157
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:02,376
Thanks. Uh, likewise.

158
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,811
Angela, you want to spin
us through the pitch deck?

159
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:08,852
Sure. So
That's OK.

160
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:10,561
I don't need to hear the pitch.

161
00:08:10,585 --> 00:08:13,227
I've been through the deck, and I get it.

162
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:17,352
Basically, you buy a painting from
some art student in a basement,

163
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:20,686
jack up the price, sell it to
some Morgan Stanley sex pest,

164
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,376
and you, me, and the
student all get rich. Right?

165
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:28,686
We're interested in increasing
the reach of young artists.

166
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,811
And the democratization of art.

167
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:32,893
No, absolutely.
I get it.

168
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:36,352
You're providing a platform
to marginalized talent,

169
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:38,394
the next generation of artists.

170
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:42,102
I'm just telling you how it works
from the outside, to the sharks.

171
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:44,269
Maybe we can talk about funding cycles.

172
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:46,935
Sure.
We've worked out a plan

173
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,060
for the first year after the launch

174
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:51,644
I'm sorry. Can I just say something?

175
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,561
Uh...

176
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:55,060
so, I I I

177
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:58,018
I got these sneakers...

178
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:00,644
on the way down here because, uh,

179
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:02,769
I thought I don't know what I thought,

180
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,935
I thought you'd all be
dressed like fuckin' Bjork,

181
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,561
and I wanted to, uh, make an impression.

182
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:14,310
Um, so, I'm a jackass, um,

183
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:17,477
the truth is, I don't
know anything about art.

184
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:21,602
What I do know is how
to monetize your concept

185
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:24,602
and achieve the scale it deserves.

186
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:27,477
Don't sell your soul to some monolith.

187
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,644
We're boutique, we're light on our feet,

188
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:33,602
we're not the Gang of Four,
we're the fuckin' Rebel Alliance.

189
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:36,561
I'm a good guy, who knows the bad guys,

190
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:40,102
I've got reach, and I will
fight for you every fuckin' day.

191
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,977
I'm the asshole who can be your Warhol.

192
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:45,852
And, uh... yeah, I just thought of that,

193
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,293
so apparently I do
know a little bit about art.

194
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,935
So... what?

195
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,602
Talk to me. What do I need to do?

196
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:57,352
Do I need to take off my dopey sneakers?

197
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:59,269
No.
I will. Seriously,

198
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:01,018
I'll throw them out the
fuckin' window right now.

199
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:04,352
They're not bad.
I'm taking 'em off.

200
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:06,644
Here. Ilhan, have 'em.
I'll trade you.

201
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:08,644
Whoo!
OK?

202
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:10,435
Can we talk now?

203
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,418
Oh, shit.

204
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:16,084
Sh.

205
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,477
Sor Um, so,

206
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:22,893
what do you think Miss?

207
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,727
Uh, betw You know.

208
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,435
Sorry, I I'm

209
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,769
I'm somewhat between the
devil and the deep blue sea here,

210
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:33,519
because my boss downstairs is waiting,

211
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:36,477
and my boss upstairs is him, you know,

212
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,394
so I've been here three and a half hours.

213
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,227
What do you think? What do you.

214
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:42,668
Do you want.

215
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:48,227
Yes, sir.

216
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:50,394
I'll send him in.

217
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:52,293
Thank you.

218
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:54,977
At long last.

219
00:10:55,001 --> 00:11:00,835
It's the wheel, it's... doin' its thing.

220
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,519
Oh, yeah. It's buffering.

221
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:06,519
You could try knocking it
down to low low quality?

222
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:07,876
Hmm. Go ahead.

223
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:11,644
Yeah, just...

224
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:16,352
It's a... heckuva good
head of hair on ya there.

225
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:20,352
I think it's the maternal
side that it's carried on, so...

226
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:22,477
So I hear you and the boys

227
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,686
are heading out for Tom's bachelor party.

228
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,811
Yes. That's correct.

229
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:30,185
Roman's arranging,
Prague has been mentioned.

230
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:32,561
I will tell you this much.

231
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:36,561
I believe Logan Roy is
a pernicious influence

232
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:37,727
on our culture.

233
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:39,561
He is, to be frank,

234
00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:42,852
Man, what a jack jackhole.
A cancer to American values.

235
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,727
I don't take these words lightly...

236
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:46,418
Yeah, well, he just lost my vote.

237
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,852
Uh, listen to me.

238
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:55,394
Um... do me a favor.

239
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:59,727
Can you make sure that Kendall
doesn't come back in a box?

240
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:01,727
OK.
Yeah, I...

241
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:03,727
I don't want him showing up dead

242
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:05,727
at the bottom of some French fag's pool.

243
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:08,644
Oh, no, absolutely. None of us do.

244
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:10,893
Keep an eye on him for me.

245
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,769
Is this something you can do for me?

246
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:16,310
Mmhmm.
I hear he's been, uh,

247
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,376
wetting his beak.

248
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:20,935
Yes, sir.

249
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,977
Um, in which case,

250
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:24,769
would now be a convenient time

251
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:28,686
to talk with you about,
like, a lateral shift

252
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,852
in terms of my position at the company?

253
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,769
Because I'd like to move on from Parks

254
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:37,185
and into, for example, Digital?

255
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:41,310
I don't want to mention
any names, because I.

256
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:45,352
But the culture there, it borders
on the personally abusive at times.

257
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:47,269
Tom?

258
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:48,561
Oh, Tom.

259
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:50,727
I didn't know he had it in him.

260
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:52,852
He can be pretty able in that department.

261
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:55,644
But what I'm doing,
sir, is I'm flagging to you

262
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:57,769
that I'm thirsty for the next chapter.

263
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:02,269
Well, you take care of this
for me, and perhaps we'll talk.

264
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,769
OK? Done? Are we done?

265
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:07,143
Muchly appreciated.

266
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,310
"Muchly"?

267
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:10,977
Time's up.

268
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:15,644
Time's up for the big media
operations that poison...

269
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:18,418
Have you seen this?
ATN spot.

270
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,459
I guess we do, right?

271
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,644
You're gonna stand there?

272
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:26,167
In my air space?

273
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,644
I'm rereading it.

274
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:33,102
For context.
You're CCed.

275
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:34,727
The power that one man wields.

276
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:38,352
We can't let these monopolistic
practices go unchecked

277
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:40,394
simply because we're too afraid

278
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:44,352
of the power that one man wields.

279
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:49,227
Waystar Royco is a cancer
at the heart of America.

280
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:51,018
I can't believe I'm getting
paid to call my dad names.

281
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,269
It's so cathartic.

282
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:54,811
Logan Roy is out of control...

283
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,227
You really think he should do ATN?

284
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:00,185
Yeah. Sure. Into the lion's den.

285
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:01,935
He'll attack them,

286
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,561
righteous, Old Testament,
anticapitalist Gil,

287
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:08,185
and they'll attack us,
"There's a Red in the bed,"

288
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,352
they get the viewers and
we get the base fired up.

289
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,310
No one's mind's getting changed,
then once we're through the primaries,

290
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,394
we pivot to center.
Except Gil won't pivot.

291
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:16,602
I say no!
I'll get him to pivot.

292
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:18,959
I say no more!

293
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:25,394
Hello?
Hey, Shiv, it's me!

294
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:28,060
Tom, sweetheart.
So listen,

295
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:29,977
something's afoot,

296
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:32,352
because we've arrived at the dropoff point

297
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:33,811
for my bachelor party.

298
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:36,227
Seems there's been a change of plan,

299
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,227
and I'm pretty sure I'm being pranked.

300
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:39,435
What's happening, Roman?

301
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:40,561
Hold your tingling wiener.

302
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:42,185
All will be clear soon.

303
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:44,727
I don't think you understand
how disruptive it is

304
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,310
to be changing the
itinerary at this late stage.

305
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,769
I don't know what's gonna happen,

306
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:53,561
but I've got a feeling it's
liable to get a little disgusting.

307
00:14:53,585 --> 00:14:55,769
I don't think you're
supposed to be telling me this.

308
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:56,935
I know, I just

309
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,435
wanted to flag it, and, you know,

310
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:00,977
calm the qualms, because
I, for one, would never

311
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,727
Tom, it's one night,

312
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:03,893
we're both adults,

313
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,352
just enjoy yourself, OK?

314
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:08,477
Aw, Shiv, honey badger.

315
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,935
God, I want to dock myself inside you

316
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,435
so much right now.

317
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:14,793
Yeah. OK. I love you too, Tom.

318
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,561
OK.

319
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,376
Now he deigns to join us.

320
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:27,935
You're late.
Yeah, sorry.

321
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,686
I've been a little busy
revolutionizing tech financing.

322
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,001
On coke.

323
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:37,269
Hey, hope not. What up?

324
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:40,418
So, who wants to fuck a hobo?

325
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:45,018
No? All right,

326
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,501
then let's party. Down there.

327
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:49,644
What No.

328
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:51,852
We're going to a party in the tunnel?

329
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:54,102
OK. No, relax, we're not going

330
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:55,561
to a party in a tunnel.

331
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:56,977
This is just a ruse.

332
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,185
What is this, some popup shit?

333
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,477
Am I gonna need my central Europe coat?

334
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,143
Romey, I'm wearing flight
socks and my TSA slippers.

335
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,018
I know what you're doing right now, OK?

336
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:07,352
I'm being lured into a tunnel

337
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:10,102
and then next thing, I'm
gonna wake up in Belgium

338
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:12,269
with no frickin' eyebrows!

339
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:15,977
Um, you probably want to
dump your luggage in the car.

340
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:17,227
Oh, shit. Um...

341
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:18,977
fellas.

342
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:21,477
Sorry, it's actually a
really tight guest list.

343
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:23,435
Oh Roman.

344
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,018
Yeah.
It's Matt and Jonas.

345
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:27,686
If the Fly Guys aren't on the They flew in!

346
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,310
Roman.
Relax, OK?

347
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:31,018
We're gonna figure it out.
We're gonna firstwave it,

348
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,060
we'll call you once
we're inside, all right?

349
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:36,143
You know what? Go get some coffees on me.

350
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:39,519
Thanks, we're good. I can buy coffee.

351
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:41,143
All right, let's go!

352
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,293
Oh, God!

353
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:46,185
I

354
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,185
I can't just leave the Fly Guys.

355
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:50,227
That's the Fly Guy code.

356
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:53,102
Uh, OK, just leave your phones on,

357
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:56,418
and I'll call ya.
All right.

358
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,751
Five minutes!
It's on.

359
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:05,893
Ohhoho, man!

360
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:09,352
Roman. What the fuck have
you got planned for me, man?

361
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:12,185
No, seriously,

362
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:13,561
what have you got planned?

363
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:16,102
Tom, Prague fell through,

364
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:18,561
and I was fuckin' busy,

365
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:20,686
and I didn't have time to plan

366
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,060
the hot air balloon to Monaco.

367
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,811
OK. Hot air balloon?

368
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,893
Yeah.
That would have been nice.

369
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,561
Whoa, dude! Oh, my God, that's a dead rat.

370
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:32,060
You guys, this is a disaster
on the footwear front.

371
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,352
Can I change?

372
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:35,310
It's a dead rat. Who gives a shit?

373
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,352
Yeah, fine, thank you, just keep goin'.

374
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:40,102
We'll be here.
All right, see you over there.

375
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,394
Are you gonna be OK around all the booze

376
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,269
and the coke and shit?

377
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:45,644
'Cause I can just make sure
no one does it around you.

378
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:47,018
I'll be fine.
Yeah?

379
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,727
Thanks, bro.
Yeah. Of course.

380
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,310
Wait up!

381
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:53,477
Jesus fuckin' Christ,
it's a dead rat. Relax.

382
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:55,269
I hear you're doin' apps.

383
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:56,811
Yeah. Uhhuh.

384
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:58,269
I'm incubating.

385
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:01,602
I'm rebalancing away from crypto into eco.

386
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:03,477
Sounds...
futuristico.

387
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:05,060
Yeah, it's good.

388
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,018
It's better than being carried
around in Dad's pockets

389
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,310
like fuckin' Stuart Little.

390
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:10,227
They're nice pockets.

391
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,018
Spacious.

392
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,185
How is he?

393
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,626
He's I mean, you know.

394
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:20,893
Actually, he's... he's got me overseeing

395
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,394
the satellite launch out of Tanegashima.

396
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:24,852
Spaceship?

397
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:28,143
Yeah. Plus I'm heading up the local deal.

398
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:29,935
Bob Galpin is selling

399
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:32,143
and, uh, I knocked it out of the park,

400
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,477
which is nice.

401
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:34,935
Good for you, bro.

402
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:39,143
Yeah. Guess I finally
broke out of the cage.

403
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:41,959
Can't keep a good dog down, right, Ken?

404
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:46,167
Abandon all hope ye who enter.

405
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:59,352
Ooh, is this real?
Is this a real corridor?

406
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:00,977
Are we goin' to an airfield?

407
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:02,310
Hey, Greg, did I tell you that Willa

408
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:03,561
moved out to Austerlitz?
Oh?

409
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,310
Yeah, she loves how quiet it is.

410
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:07,143
She didn't think she would, but she does.

411
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:10,185
So I for one won't be
engaging in any debauchery.

412
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:11,852
Roman Roy and guests?

413
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:13,143
That is correct.

414
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,644
Welcome to Rhomboid.
Thank you.

415
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:18,811
Oh, yeah. Boys, we're pouching our phones.

416
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:20,935
Hey, wait! Is this it?

417
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,102
Is this actually where I'm
going to have my bachelor party?

418
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:26,686
Why is it so wet? I think
there's a big leak somewhere.

419
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,727
I've been living on central European time

420
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,185
for 48 hours to ease the transition.

421
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:32,018
I'm gonna be ready for breakfast soon.

422
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:34,811
I don't know if this is the
kind of party with a lot of food.

423
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,602
Roman, I'm sorry, is this where
I'm having my bachelor party?

424
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:39,060
Roman, how are you, man?

425
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:41,251
Ken. Long time.

426
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,001
Are we good?

427
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:47,727
You're my thirdoldest friend.

428
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,852
You fucked me like a tied goat.

429
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:51,935
We're great.
No, yeah,

430
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,042
you're goin' the right
way. Keep goin' straight.

431
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:58,269
Kendall, I was gonna say.
Yeah?

432
00:19:58,293 --> 00:19:59,519
If you need anything tonight,

433
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,060
bottle of water, soft drink,

434
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:03,394
whatever, I'm gonna be your mule.

435
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:06,227
Actually, you know what? I
need something a little offmenu.

436
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:07,811
See if you can find me some ketamine.

437
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:09,561
I don't know what that is.

438
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,811
Is Sandy here? When do we sit?

439
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,018
Yeah, yeah, all things in time.

440
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:15,668
Right here.

441
00:20:17,418 --> 00:20:18,626
Sorry.

442
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:25,310
Oh, well. Now I'm sure it's
gonna be great. Thanks, Roman.

443
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,769
What did you expect?
Why'd you even ask me, Tom?

444
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,018
Thought you'd rise to the occasion.

445
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:32,459
Well, clearly I haven't
risen to the occasion.

446
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:41,001
Gents, have a great fuckin' night.

447
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:44,561
Dmitri, how are you?

448
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:47,167
Hey, Kendall. I'll find you, all right?

449
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:52,102
OK. This is it.

450
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,935
Yeah? Cool, right?

451
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:57,394
Is it cool, or is it, like,
total fucking bullshit?

452
00:20:57,418 --> 00:20:59,060
Well, what is it? What is it?

453
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,102
It's a physical fun palace.

454
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,519
It's basically, if you're
into it, and she's into it,

455
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:04,727
it's all good.

456
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,435
Look at this fucking guy with the bird mask

457
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:07,519
like Eyes Wide Shut.

458
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:09,102
Oh, wow. Eyes w.

459
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:11,811
Wait, is this is this gonna be an orgy?

460
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:14,310
No.
This is not gonna be an orgy?

461
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:17,352
Greg, it's not 1997.
It's not this, it's not that.

462
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,352
Don't be so binary, Mr. Betamax.

463
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:21,644
Is it gonna be like
a little bit of an orgy?

464
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:23,686
It's basically a collective of hot people

465
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,227
and Connor at a party.

466
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:27,102
And a monkey dressed
as an astronaut, apparently.

467
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:29,310
It's whatever you want it to be.

468
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:31,977
It's a fucking sand pit
for emergent behavior.

469
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,269
OK, OK, holy shit. So OK. OK.

470
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,227
So, does that mean
we're able to... fuck here?

471
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:40,018
Yeah. Hey, Ken, what do you
think of the pussycat? On it?

472
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,935
No, not me. Business is my fucking.

473
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,977
Great. I'll find you a Bloomberg
terminal to stick your dick in.

474
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:48,769
Well, I'm out. In a
relationship. Girlfriend!

475
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:51,185
I gotta say, Roman,
this is looking promising.

476
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,519
This is looking really promising!

477
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:54,561
See? Have a little faith.

478
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:56,185
There's areas, though, right?

479
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:58,561
Neutral areas in terms
of not being, you know,

480
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:00,686
compulsory to do sex stuff?

481
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,602
No, Greg. If you refuse,
they cut your dick off.

482
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:06,042
What did I just say? It's very consensual.

483
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:12,394
Angela.

484
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:14,501
Angela?

485
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,561
Angela. Angela.

486
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:18,852
Yo. Dust.

487
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:20,561
Oh. Fuck.
Hey. What's up?

488
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:22,435
Yeah, hey, what's happening?

489
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:25,310
Here we are in a fuckin' warehouse

490
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:28,269
in Sunset Park or whatever.
Yeah.

491
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:30,018
I feel like this is synchronicity.

492
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:33,310
Yeah? Like the universe
is telling us something.

493
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:36,644
Yeah. We really appreciated
you coming to see us.

494
00:22:36,668 --> 00:22:38,394
Yeah, yeah, totally,

495
00:22:38,418 --> 00:22:40,435
I'm superexcited.

496
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,602
Yeah. Totally. Me too.

497
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:46,477
OK, well, fuck, yeah. Excellent. All right.

498
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:49,310
All right. Good to see you.

499
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,543
Yeah.

500
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,435
You know, I was thinking,

501
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,935
maybe one wine, one water,

502
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:01,519
as like an informal rule for the group?

503
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:04,060
Also, uh, they have risotto balls.

504
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,435
Like, they're soakers. Supersoakers.

505
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:08,394
Ketamine.
Greg! Greg!

506
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:11,561
Got you one. Come on,
man, it's goin' off tonight!

507
00:23:11,585 --> 00:23:13,394
We should talk to some girls.

508
00:23:13,418 --> 00:23:15,893
Ask 'em where they were on 9/11.

509
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:19,310
If they don't know, they could be under 21.

510
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:20,893
Well, Shiv gave me a hall pass.

511
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,893
'Cause we're adults. Apparently.

512
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:26,769
I'm gonna blow my load like multiple times.

513
00:23:26,793 --> 00:23:30,893
Wow. So And Shiv has that same arrangement?

514
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:33,435
She's an adult too, so...

515
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,352
What? No, no.

516
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:36,935
Well, yeah, sure.

517
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,143
I mean, I don't know,
Greg. It's not a competition.

518
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,644
No, no, no.
That's cool.

519
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:42,269
I'm sure you guys have it all figured out.

520
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:45,102
Romey, what is this? Molly. Happy pills.

521
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:47,227
Oh, cool.
But I wouldn't.

522
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:48,852
No, no, no, no. Prague time.

523
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:51,435
It's two in the morning for
me. I need a little pickmeup.

524
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,519
Don't.
Dude. I know my way around.

525
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:55,935
1986, me, a Fleetwood Mac LP,

526
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,811
and a bag of weed touched the face of God.

527
00:23:57,835 --> 00:24:00,477
Huh? The first of the
evening, the first of many.

528
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:03,394
Do not do any more of these.
Got it. I'm one and done.

529
00:24:03,418 --> 00:24:05,102
Got a lot of shit cookin',

530
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:08,727
like, artificial sun solar cells thing...

531
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,811
Yeah. Listen, man, about the vote,

532
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:13,811
and your dad and us,

533
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:16,435
I love you, man, but you
know I had to follow the money.

534
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:18,352
You know that, right?

535
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:19,935
I get it.

536
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,727
All right. Hey, why don't we
talk in private for a second?

537
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:25,435
Can we do that?
We can talk right here.

538
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:26,811
All right.

539
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:30,561
So listen, I have a question for you.

540
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:33,102
How would you like to be all the way out?

541
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:35,917
Half a bill for your share of Waystar.

542
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:40,977
Is this for real?
Yeah, man.

543
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:43,102
I'm feelin' fuckin' generous, that's all.

544
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:45,519
And I've plumped the pillows
and added a little premium.

545
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:47,519
Consisting of what?
Straight liquid.

546
00:24:47,543 --> 00:24:48,977
Bullshit.
Don't you worry about it.

547
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,102
I can raise it.

548
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:51,686
Why would you want to be even more in?

549
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,018
"The place is a fucki" antique shop.

550
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:56,917
Ken, just take the money
and get out. Please.

551
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:02,852
I mean...

552
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,893
it's not uninteresting.

553
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,060
Fantastic. Great. So listen,

554
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:08,519
there's a part two to this.

555
00:25:08,543 --> 00:25:11,310
Why don't we talk this over with Sandy?

556
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:13,686
Sandy... Furness?

557
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,394
Come with me.

558
00:25:15,418 --> 00:25:16,811
Come.

559
00:25:16,835 --> 00:25:18,686
Bottom's up.

560
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,209
One, two, three!
Ketamine.

561
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:26,418
You good?
Line 'em up, please.

562
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:29,394
These bathrobes are nice.

563
00:25:29,418 --> 00:25:32,227
See these?
Uhhuh.

564
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:34,060
What's your table linen philosophy?

565
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:37,519
Uh, my philosophy is I
literally don't give a fuck.

566
00:25:37,543 --> 00:25:40,310
So what's that, Nietzsche?

567
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:41,935
These are what's

568
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,644
on our registry.

569
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:44,727
Hmm.

570
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,893
You should go for these.

571
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,769
Right, you want us to
have matching cutlery?

572
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:51,352
Why not?

573
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:55,209
It'll be sort of horrible, and cute.

574
00:25:56,835 --> 00:26:01,060
So when we both get
divorced and split all our stuff,

575
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:03,769
we can hook up and have the same set.

576
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:06,435
The full set.
Mmhmm.

577
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,769
Yeah.

578
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:10,418
Nahhahhah.

579
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:13,143
You know this is just fun, right?

580
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:17,310
I know, it's just It's nothing.

581
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,561
I mean, it's not anything. There's no God,

582
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:21,561
there's no... anything,

583
00:26:21,585 --> 00:26:23,977
there's just people in rooms

584
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,269
trying to be happy.

585
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,585
Right?
Right.

586
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,727
Oh, and I suggested to Gil

587
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:38,310
that he cool off on the
antiWaystar agenda on ATN tonight.

588
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:39,977
Excuse me?
Yeah.

589
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,727
I talked to him at the thing.

590
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:43,143
Oh. OK.

591
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:45,143
Well, I did spend quite some time

592
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,352
on how it'd be very vivid to attack Waystar

593
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:49,977
on a Waystar network, but...
Very vivid?

594
00:26:50,001 --> 00:26:53,769
It's played out. Makes it
look like we have an agenda.

595
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:55,644
Uh, we do. Stopping

596
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:57,060
overly mighty media owners

597
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:59,310
setting the agenda for our democracy.

598
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:01,935
DOJ, FCC, Batman,

599
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:04,602
to stop your dad eating the news.

600
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,519
OK, but even if we're going for that,

601
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,602
isn't that in some big
speech that no one reads?

602
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:13,060
Can't he just connect to America
tonight and forget the base?

603
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:16,686
Shiv, I appreciate you might
have split loyalties on this.

604
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,185
Fuck you. I'm just trying to make him win.

605
00:27:18,209 --> 00:27:20,143
I don't think he can do both at once.

606
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:23,394
I don't think Gil can do
the base and the rest.

607
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:25,852
Well, if he can't ride two horses at once,

608
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:27,876
he shouldn't be working at the circus.

609
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:34,269
Sandy comes to these?
Oh, yeah. He loves sex.

610
00:27:34,293 --> 00:27:37,852
Dude, the thing that he pees through,

611
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:39,435
he puts into other people.

612
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,310
It's fucking vile. And a lot.

613
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:42,477
Hey, Sandy.

614
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:45,126
Oh. Gents, excuse me.

615
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,185
Kendall. You look well.
Thank you.

616
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:52,769
You look, uh, out of place.

617
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:55,060
I do like to see the youngsters frolic.

618
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:57,352
So, you wanna talk?

619
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:00,251
Uh, did Stewy fill you in?

620
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:04,310
Why do I feel like I'm about to find out

621
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:07,352
you're not my real
mommy and daddy after all?

622
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:08,935
Look, the truth is,

623
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,227
he wants your piece of pie,

624
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:14,793
but and please don't
fucking blow a fuse here, OK?

625
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:19,561
The reality is, he's already in on Waystar.

626
00:28:19,585 --> 00:28:23,060
As in?
As in Sandy's me,

627
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:24,352
and I'm Sandy.

628
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,394
We're like a single entity.

629
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,561
Like a creature from mythology.

630
00:28:28,585 --> 00:28:31,977
You know, head of a horse, dick of a swan.

631
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,269
Stewy... seriously?

632
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:39,727
I have a shell company
attached to his private equity fund.

633
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,668
I'm a parasite on a parasite.

634
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,602
You should have disclosed
that to me when I brought you in.

635
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:53,102
You are one hundred percent correct
about that. I should have done that.

636
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:54,602
You were in a tough position

637
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:58,727
without having to consider whether your dad

638
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:00,852
would want me involved.

639
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:04,352
He very much would not.

640
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:07,561
So apparently, my girlfriend's
having a panic attack.

641
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:11,585
I'm gonna let you two
just catch up now. Cool?

642
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:16,561
Stewy tells me you're getting into tech.

643
00:29:16,585 --> 00:29:17,769
Yeah, I have a fund.

644
00:29:17,793 --> 00:29:20,185
We're niche, but we're engaged.

645
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:22,310
Just closed a deal tonight, actually.

646
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:24,602
And I found these four Stanford grads

647
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:26,769
who are doing this thing, it's pretty cool,

648
00:29:26,793 --> 00:29:29,102
they have this cluster of hydrogen lamps...

649
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:30,686
Wait. What's going on?

650
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,977
Dude, are you pitching? You just pitch?

651
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:33,644
Where'd you spring from, Heidi?

652
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:35,935
Don't stop. I want to hear
the pitch. I might invest.

653
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:38,602
We were just talking.

654
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:40,477
To him? The enemy?

655
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,727
The adults are talking. How
about you go play in the other room?

656
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:45,561
Hey, Sandy, could I maybe
get a moment with you in private?

657
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:48,602
I'd like to talk to you about
how attached you're feeling

658
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:51,143
to your 50 failing local TV stations.

659
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,227
Sure. I'm sure we could find a time.

660
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,893
Roman, could you maybe
back off for, like, 20 minutes?

661
00:29:57,917 --> 00:29:59,143
No.
Yeah. Get us a drink?

662
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:01,185
I would love another oldfashioned.

663
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:03,352
He would love another
oldfashioned, cliché that he is.

664
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:04,893
No, that's not gonna happen.

665
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:06,561
I know that you and my dad

666
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:10,018
have been deeply and
madly in hate with each other,

667
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,602
and you have been for many years,

668
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:13,602
but I want you to know
that I'm my own thing,

669
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:15,602
and I am fully authorized

670
00:30:15,626 --> 00:30:17,852
I am fully authorized

671
00:30:17,876 --> 00:30:19,769
to negotiate on behalf of Logan.

672
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:22,102
Yeah, he's doing satellites like it's 1985.

673
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:24,852
Dad's got him holding the
plastic steering wheel in the back

674
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:26,185
and telling him he's driving.

675
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:28,102
You have to excuse my brother.

676
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,227
He's adjusting to his medication right now.

677
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,227
How about you fuck off
back to your little gangbang?

678
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:34,686
See how he talks to me?
You're embarrassing yourself.

679
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,394
You're family.
He used to lock me in a cage.

680
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,852
What the fuck?
No, that's a true story.

681
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:42,352
What, you're pretending that you
don't remember the dog pound?

682
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:44,561
Are you tripping?
Yeah, it was a "game."

683
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:47,394
I had to go climb in this
big dog cage in the kitchen

684
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:49,060
and wait for someone to come collect me.

685
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:50,561
Oh, yeah? Well, II don't know.

686
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:52,977
Might be three minutes,
might be the whole afternoon.

687
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,811
Four years old. I was eating
dog food out of a cold tin bowl.

688
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:59,477
I know, right? They should make
a fuckin' movie of this shit, right?

689
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:01,893
Excuse me.

690
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,835
I'll be back.

691
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:09,269
What the fuck are you doing?
What?

692
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:12,686
What was that bullshit?
I can say what I want.

693
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,893
Yeah, but you That was
insane. You're acting insane.

694
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,060
So you just want me to pretend
that none of that happened?

695
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,644
What happened?

696
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:21,227
None of it happened.
Dog pound didn't happen.

697
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:22,852
I never made you eat dog food.

698
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:24,727
There was a bowl that was filled with chow,

699
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:27,310
and I couldn't leave the
cage until I finished it.

700
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:28,852
It was a game, you enjoyed it.

701
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:31,060
AAsk Connor. Ask Shiv.

702
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:32,935
I enjoyed being in a cage
with a leash around my neck?

703
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:35,519
So now there's a
leash? You're full of shit.

704
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:37,686
Me? I'm full of shit?

705
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,310
Have fun.
Get the fuck outta here.

706
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:42,084
Asshole! Nwahh!

707
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,769
So I got this gelding, right?
Chestnut brown.

708
00:31:53,793 --> 00:31:57,060
You wouldn't believe the
size of this guy's cranium.

709
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:58,435
Big ol' noggin!

710
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,227
Hey! Con, can I ask you something?

711
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,811
Do you remember anything about a
dog pound when we were growing up?

712
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:04,394
Sure, I remember that
game you used to play.

713
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:06,686
So he used to lock me in a fucking cage.

714
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,185
Sure, the big cage, yeah,
in your mother's place.

715
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:10,477
The laundry room in Cheltenham.

716
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:12,060
Thank you! He's trying to gaslight me.

717
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:13,602
No, you liked it!

718
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:15,269
You asked to be put in that cage.

719
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:16,769
What?
Yeah.

720
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:18,893
It was really weird, but
I think you enjoyed it.

721
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:21,310
OK, so I asked to eat dog food?

722
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:23,852
It was chocolate cake. I think.

723
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,310
Bullshit.
I don't know.

724
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:27,435
No. Kendall locked me
in a cage, I went weird,

725
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:28,852
I started wetting the bed,

726
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:30,644
and that's why Dad sent
me away to St. Andrews.

727
00:32:30,668 --> 00:32:32,477
No, Rome, Dad sent you to military school

728
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:34,602
because you asked to go.

729
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:37,459
Oh, you're full of shit!
That's how I remember it!

730
00:32:38,585 --> 00:32:40,060
So listen, my ranch

731
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,893
is completely safe from
biological or chemical attack.

732
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,477
These are your friends, right?
Yeah.

733
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:46,959
You'd all be welcome,
anytime, pre or postapocalypse.

734
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:55,977
Tom!

735
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,018
Tom.
Hey.

736
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,519
Have you seen Kendall?

737
00:32:58,543 --> 00:32:59,626
No.

738
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:04,251
I feel like we should maybe
keep an eye out for him.

739
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:08,876
Aw, damn it.

740
00:33:18,793 --> 00:33:20,686
Tom, sweetheart, I'm at ATN with Gil.

741
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,811
What's the least amount of
syllables you can say this in?

742
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,310
Well, I just want to be clear

743
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:25,519
in terms of you and me.

744
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:27,977
Is this a quid pro quo arrangement?

745
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:30,269
I don't know what you're talking about.

746
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:32,269
It's just, you know, if I

747
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:33,769
if I, for instance,

748
00:33:33,793 --> 00:33:35,185
if I touch a boob,

749
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:36,893
do you grab a dick?

750
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:38,935
I don't know if that's a.

751
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:40,435
Just to get a rough chart of comparison

752
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:41,935
from Fahrenheit to Celsius,

753
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,727
or, you know, an eye for an eye?

754
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:45,602
Or an orifice for an orifice?

755
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:48,727
I'm just trying to get a
sense of the parameters here.

756
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:51,394
Uh, Tom, I can't negotiate right now.

757
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:53,811
But we know, right? We just know.

758
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:55,227
Sure.

759
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:56,852
We know.

760
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:59,227
S Oop.

761
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:01,185
So you want to run the tree
on how personal stuff plays?

762
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:03,060
Issues, issues, issues.

763
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,852
I can handle the soft soap, Shiv.

764
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,852
Hey, Kendall. Just spoke to Shiv.

765
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:10,102
Official permission for having of the fun.

766
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:11,668
Amazing. So happy for you.

767
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,626
Hey, man, can I get this, uh.

768
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:22,561
Hey, Ken.
Hey, Frank. Listen.

769
00:34:22,585 --> 00:34:24,018
I've had an approach.

770
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:26,060
It's kind of a very interesting approach,

771
00:34:26,084 --> 00:34:27,935
and I wanted to get your brain on it.

772
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:30,394
I heard from the girls. The
Dust thing. With the art?

773
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:33,185
Yeah, I know. I saw them. It's locked down.

774
00:34:33,209 --> 00:34:36,143
They wanted you to know
they loved you in the room. But

775
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:38,394
I just spoke to the girl. We're good.

776
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:41,435
Ken, they're already
setting this up elsewhere.

777
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:42,477
But like I said,

778
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:43,519
they loved you in the room.

779
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:45,394
What are you talking about?

780
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,977
I think there's other money
and they liked it better.

781
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:49,352
Then we match it.

782
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:52,352
I tried that already, but.

783
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:54,602
Seriously, they loved you in the room.

784
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,352
Will you stop telling me they
loved me in the fucking room?!

785
00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:59,710
Frank! I heard you the first time.

786
00:35:01,876 --> 00:35:04,310
OK. OK, let me talk to her.

787
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:06,227
I can fix this.

788
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:07,501
Yeah?

789
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:36,893
Hey. Hey. Can we talk for a second?

790
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,102
Can we do this another time?

791
00:35:38,126 --> 00:35:40,143
I just got off the phone
to Frank.

792
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:42,435
What happened? He told me.

793
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:44,519
I'm sorry, it's nothing personal.

794
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:47,310
I shouldn't be telling you this, but I'm
about to land a chunk of seed capital

795
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:49,519
the size of fuckin' Idaho,

796
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:52,352
so, I mean, whatever it is you need,

797
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:54,935
I can make it happen. OK?

798
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,852
Yeah, OK.
OK?

799
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:59,519
So are we good?

800
00:35:59,543 --> 00:36:01,602
You know, it's just not about that.

801
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,561
Then, like, help me out here,

802
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:06,769
'cause there's something I'm not seeing.

803
00:36:06,793 --> 00:36:10,435
It's the name.
Which? You mean "Dust"?

804
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,935
Roy. Kendall Roy.

805
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:14,852
It'd be like I was marrying Hitler,

806
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:17,102
and then I'd get to be, what, Mrs. Hitler?

807
00:36:17,126 --> 00:36:20,143
OK, uh, that's not really fair,

808
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,018
I mean...

809
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:24,227
Look, that's that's not me.

810
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:26,686
I'm not a Roy.

811
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,811
OK? Not really.

812
00:36:28,835 --> 00:36:31,727
I'm sorry. It's cool, we just
don't want to be Hitler Incorp.

813
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:34,060
Can you stop saying Hitler?
Please? You don't know what I am.

814
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:36,686
Consensus is you're a cokedup
prick who can't shit straight.

815
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,561
You think you're different?

816
00:36:40,585 --> 00:36:42,143
OK, Angela. You know what,

817
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,561
I'm gonna be frank with you.

818
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:45,394
Look, I didn't want to do this here.

819
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:48,185
And I may be being more
forthright 'cause of the coke.

820
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:49,852
I tend to get more forthright on coke.

821
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:51,060
All right? I'm sorry.

822
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,561
OK, look, hey, listen.

823
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,209
Hey, fuck off!

824
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:06,543
Hey, man, can I get in on this?

825
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:20,935
I'm joined in the studio by
Senator Gil Eavis. Firstly, Senator,

826
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,893
welcome. We really appreciate it.

827
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,602
Happy to be here, Sharon.

828
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:27,727
I want to just jump straight in, if we may.

829
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:31,811
Your wife very tragically took
her own life 18 months ago.

830
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,644
The warmest of ATN welcomes.

831
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,602
I think everybody knows

832
00:37:35,626 --> 00:37:39,394
about that, and it's
something I live with every day.

833
00:37:39,418 --> 00:37:42,185
But it's not relevant to the issues.

834
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:44,352
I want to explore
The impression you've given

835
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:46,561
is that it did inform your decision to run.

836
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:49,310
A lot of things inform
a big decision like this.

837
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,102
But what I want to talk about tonight.

838
00:37:51,126 --> 00:37:52,477
But it hasn't been long,

839
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:55,060
and I guess that what
some people may ask is,

840
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:57,102
what could possibly have
caused such a tragedy?

841
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:59,060
And are you ready so suddenly

842
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:02,435
to turn around and run
for the highest office?

843
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:03,561
Doesn't he have a line for this?

844
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:05,477
It's usually normally OK.

845
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:08,310
I'm focused on what I think
this country needs to do

846
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:10,644
to move to
So you have thought about it,

847
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,310
your mental and emotional state?

848
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:14,935
I think about my feelings,
like most humans...

849
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,811
Oh, no, no. No sarcasm.

850
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:19,060
It must be incredibly difficult for you

851
00:38:19,084 --> 00:38:20,893
as a person who has had to deal with rumors

852
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:22,811
swirling about the state
of his mental health.

853
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:25,477
Why don't we stop playing
this game of pretend sympathy

854
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:27,977
where you're just trying
to get your viewers to ask,

855
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:29,935
"What sort of guy has
a wife who kills herself?"

856
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:32,227
That is
You wanna make this personal?

857
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:34,394
Let's talk about Logan Roy, shall we?

858
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:39,185
The paymaster who set you up
in this hack job against me today.

859
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:40,561
Oh, Senator, come on.

860
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,102
If you want to know about a person,

861
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:44,269
look at his relationships with his family.

862
00:38:44,293 --> 00:38:45,769
His only daughter

863
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:48,143
has come to work for me.
Oh, fuck off.

864
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:51,084
Shiv.
I'm not the fucking angle.

865
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:54,519
So you don't want to
take any more questions?

866
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:57,310
Certainly not from you. Thank you.

867
00:38:57,334 --> 00:39:00,694
Unfortunately, that seems to be all the
time we're going to have with Senator Eavis.

868
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:14,459
Hey! Kenny!

869
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:22,519
Whoa. That's a chunk of
chang you got there, buddy.

870
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:24,293
It sure is, Greg.

871
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:29,310
Maybe... just ease ease into that, right?

872
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:30,585
I mean, not all at once?

873
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:35,394
Can I help you with something, man?

874
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:37,893
What the fuck's going on?
You've been up my ass all night.

875
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,893
No, I just I'm just
keepin' an eye out for you.

876
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:42,935
I mean, drugs You don't know where.

877
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:46,102
Is this Rava? Did she put you up to this?

878
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:47,519
No.

879
00:39:47,543 --> 00:39:49,561
Then what's your fuckin' deal, man?

880
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:53,352
Your dad is, I think, a little
worried about you is all.

881
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:56,185
My dad asked you to fuckin' spy on me?

882
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:58,519
No, not spy, watch.

883
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:00,602
Familystyle watching you.

884
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:02,269
Wow.
You know?

885
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:06,435
I'm about to do these
four lines of cocaine,

886
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:09,102
to top up the four I just did,

887
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:11,686
and then my heart's gonna explode.

888
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,102
So if you want to stop me,

889
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:16,935
be my guest.

890
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,435
I don't do white drugs.

891
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,935
My dad's gonna be superdisappointed

892
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,561
if his son ODs.

893
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:24,835
I know.
So...?

894
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:35,852
What the fuck?

895
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:37,459
He's counting on you to look after me.

896
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:42,394
OK, OK, OK! Stop. Stop.

897
00:40:42,418 --> 00:40:44,084
OK. Give it to me.

898
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:49,561
Go on.
I'm goin'.

899
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:51,352
Ooh, Greg!

900
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:53,227
Go for it, Greg!

901
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:55,501
Suck on those big white
dicks, you fuckin' pervert.

902
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,793
Oh!

903
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:10,543
Greg, you greedy piece of shit.

904
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:14,102
Oh, my God!

905
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:17,001
Greg, you total coke whore.

906
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:22,727
Should I puke?

907
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:25,668
Not unless you can puke
up your entire bloodstream.

908
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,811
Oh, my God, man.
That is strong drugs.

909
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:32,310
I know. I hope you don't die.
Oh, my God!

910
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:34,811
If you do, your heart is
gonna be pumping so hard

911
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:38,435
it'll probably bring you back to life.

912
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:41,251
Where did he go?
Buckle up, fucklehead!

913
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:04,626
Hi.

914
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:08,477
Hello, Pinky.
Hello.

915
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:11,917
I'm glad you kept the date.
Well, family.

916
00:42:13,793 --> 00:42:16,811
How was the play?
Oh, you know,

917
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,917
people pretending to be people.

918
00:42:20,126 --> 00:42:22,602
How are the wedding arrangements?

919
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,561
Very exciting.

920
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:27,310
Yeah, well, I'm excited. My daughter.

921
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:29,352
So you saw the interview.

922
00:42:29,376 --> 00:42:30,727
They told me.

923
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:32,626
You came after the man's wife.

924
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:35,811
They said.

925
00:42:35,835 --> 00:42:37,852
You're OK with that?

926
00:42:37,876 --> 00:42:40,727
Tell him not to speak about my family,

927
00:42:40,751 --> 00:42:42,727
not on my network...

928
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:45,727
not on any network, ever again.

929
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:47,352
Or I'll end him.

930
00:42:47,376 --> 00:42:50,727
Yeah, silence the man who
says you're stifling dissent.

931
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,477
I'm a bad father? How dare he.

932
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:56,644
He's a bad fuckin'
husband. He killed his wife.

933
00:42:56,668 --> 00:42:58,727
Oh, come on. Dad.

934
00:42:58,751 --> 00:43:00,852
What if the acquisitions you're making

935
00:43:00,876 --> 00:43:02,852
are actually bad for the country?

936
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:05,269
He's using you. Can't you see it?

937
00:43:05,293 --> 00:43:08,977
Don't let any of the bullshit
overshadow your wedding.

938
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:10,602
The wedding?

939
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:12,102
The fucking wedding? I don't give a shit.

940
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:15,143
Oh, Siobhan, come on. Stop screwing around.

941
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:17,602
I want to talk about you properly.

942
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:21,769
Come in. I'm tired of this.

943
00:43:21,793 --> 00:43:23,769
You have potential.

944
00:43:23,793 --> 00:43:26,811
I've always thought you were the smartest.

945
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:29,376
So that's why you tried
Kendall and Roman first?

946
00:43:31,126 --> 00:43:34,143
Do you know what? I am the smartest.

947
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:36,018
Which is why I can see through you

948
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:38,602
and this transparent
little offer to buy me off.

949
00:43:38,626 --> 00:43:42,310
I've always tried to do
right by you, Siobhan.

950
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:44,561
And maybe...

951
00:43:44,585 --> 00:43:46,811
maybe I shouldn't have.

952
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:49,477
Maybe I should just let them come for you.

953
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,143
Like who?

954
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,710
Like... I don't know.

955
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:56,876
But I hear things.

956
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:02,519
Are you threatening me?

957
00:44:02,543 --> 00:44:04,977
Absolutely not.

958
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:07,352
If this is the way things are
gonna go, then fuck off, Dad.

959
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:10,585
Then... I'm truly sorry.

960
00:44:20,126 --> 00:44:21,769
So, in terms of Shiv,

961
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:23,852
where I've landed is, uh,

962
00:44:23,876 --> 00:44:25,561
I'm maybe just gonna ask for a handy.

963
00:44:25,585 --> 00:44:27,852
Think that's OK?
Don't prerationalize.

964
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:30,710
You get off, you eat the shame for dessert.

965
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:38,143
Wait. Her? That one?
Yeah. We were talking

966
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:40,352
for, like, 20 minutes
about financial derivatives,

967
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:41,727
and she just asked me.

968
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:43,352
My God! Holy shit!

969
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:45,852
Dad would go fuckin' nuts
for her. You should do it.

970
00:44:45,876 --> 00:44:47,310
Yeah?
Yeah! Fuck yeah!

971
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:48,561
I'd be all over that.

972
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:52,477
I'd, like... I'd fuckin'...

973
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:55,143
Arrgh! Fuck.

974
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,917
OK, well...

975
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:00,769
I need something. Do you have a Smint?

976
00:45:00,793 --> 00:45:02,102
What?
Do you have a Smint?

977
00:45:02,126 --> 00:45:04,835
No! Just grab your baloneypipe and jizz.

978
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:10,751
OK. OK.
Yeah. OK.

979
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:16,376
Champagne?

980
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:20,459
Bye.
Bye.

981
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:32,269
You gotta get into P.R.

982
00:45:32,293 --> 00:45:34,310
That's where the real fuckin' money.

983
00:45:34,334 --> 00:45:36,435
Do you think now would be a good
time to sit down with the old fart?

984
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:40,018
Dude, did you see that guy
jerking off near the hors d'oeuvres?

985
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:42,018
Dude, that's a fuckin' health hazard.

986
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:44,143
Uh, no. When do you
think I can talk to him?

987
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:46,102
I'd really love to hear
something to take home.

988
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:48,686
Uhhuh. RoRo, can you
just be fucking cool, man?

989
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,435
Maybe get a slider.

990
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:53,227
Ask if can stick your finger up
someone's ass, all right, buddy?

991
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,435
Jeez.
Hey! Fuck you!

992
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:59,018
I'm not your little pet that
you get to kick around.

993
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:01,185
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me, space suit.

994
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:02,769
Bro.

995
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,352
You think that I can't
make your life difficult,

996
00:46:04,376 --> 00:46:05,811
but word in the right ear,

997
00:46:05,835 --> 00:46:07,519
and I could be your migraine, motherfucker.

998
00:46:07,543 --> 00:46:10,686
I came here to talk to
the old man on your word,

999
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,686
so make it happen.

1000
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,018
OK.
Yeah?

1001
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:16,293
All right.
Cool.

1002
00:46:19,668 --> 00:46:20,917
Ahh!

1003
00:46:23,418 --> 00:46:26,352
I tried to hide... but it finds you.

1004
00:46:26,376 --> 00:46:28,751
Wherever you hide, the party finds you.

1005
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:32,935
Sir, this is your final warning.

1006
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,227
Absolutely.

1007
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:35,435
Got it.

1008
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,477
Wait. What's happening?

1009
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:37,893
Your friend here

1010
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:39,769
keeps telling people
he's in love with them,

1011
00:46:39,793 --> 00:46:41,269
and it's making people uncomfortable.

1012
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:42,935
My bad. Mixed messages.

1013
00:46:42,959 --> 00:46:47,352
It's just we share such strong
feelings about gut bacteria

1014
00:46:47,376 --> 00:46:49,686
I think I got the wrong end of the stick.

1015
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,917
Watch him.

1016
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:55,519
Maybe I should go apologize.

1017
00:46:55,543 --> 00:46:57,084
Give her a hug.

1018
00:46:58,167 --> 00:46:59,977
Oh, my God, dude!

1019
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:02,018
That was insane!

1020
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:03,727
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Me and this girl,

1021
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:06,727
we go into this side room
and we start making out,

1022
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,227
and then I'm touching her

1023
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:09,811
and then she goes down on me,

1024
00:47:09,835 --> 00:47:13,018
and then I splooge in her mouth, and

1025
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:14,143
I know! I know!

1026
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:16,060
She kisses me

1027
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:19,143
and puts it back in my
mouth, and I swallow.

1028
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:21,185
Which, the cum?

1029
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:23,310
I know. So hot!

1030
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:25,185
You swallowed your own load?

1031
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,018
Yeah. I heard of it, but I don't

1032
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:29,060
I didn't know it actually happened.

1033
00:47:29,084 --> 00:47:30,686
I haven't heard about it before.

1034
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,852
I have. It's a thing.
There's a word for it.

1035
00:47:32,876 --> 00:47:36,227
I can't remember what it is right now.

1036
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:38,376
Hmm.
So fuckin' hot.

1037
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:44,394
When are we allowed to go home?

1038
00:47:44,418 --> 00:47:46,001
We have cars at 5:00.

1039
00:47:48,543 --> 00:47:51,185
Greg, I'm having the time of my life.

1040
00:47:51,209 --> 00:47:52,626
This is nightmarish.

1041
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:05,893
You ready for your bachelorette party?

1042
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:07,686
They were out of marine uniforms,

1043
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,418
so I've come dressed
as a political consultant.

1044
00:48:12,668 --> 00:48:14,001
Sss...

1045
00:48:19,334 --> 00:48:20,811
Relax.

1046
00:48:20,835 --> 00:48:22,418
This isn't real.

1047
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:28,543
It's becoming real, which
might be a problem for us.

1048
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,459
Uh... can I stay?

1049
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:38,977
But with you, as a human dog

1050
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:40,959
just at the foot of the bed?

1051
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:44,167
I love you, Kenny.

1052
00:48:46,251 --> 00:48:48,769
I love you too, man.
I'm tryin' to find this girl,

1053
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:50,519
but I think she's trying to hide from me.

1054
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:52,852
Listen, is there another room for humping?

1055
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:54,477
'Cause I also lost Roman.

1056
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:56,852
Fuck Roman.
Well, you know,

1057
00:48:56,876 --> 00:48:58,977
he was askin' about the dog pound,

1058
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:00,561
and he got kind of riled up.

1059
00:49:00,585 --> 00:49:01,893
Is he still talking about that?

1060
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:03,018
Yeah.

1061
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:05,060
It's pathetic.
Yeah.

1062
00:49:05,084 --> 00:49:06,227
He enjoyed it, right?

1063
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:07,561
Oh, yeah!

1064
00:49:07,585 --> 00:49:08,811
I mean, you did too.

1065
00:49:08,835 --> 00:49:10,686
You know, just messin' around.

1066
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,227
Yeah, just messin' around.

1067
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:14,394
Dad's theory was you got two fighting dogs,

1068
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,935
you send the weak one away,

1069
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:17,018
you punish the weak one.

1070
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:18,811
Then everyone knows the hierarchy,

1071
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:20,018
then everyone's happy.

1072
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,310
So away he went.

1073
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,977
I gotta keep lookin'. OK.

1074
00:49:24,001 --> 00:49:26,519
Hi! Hey, may I ask you,

1075
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:28,143
where were you on 9/11?

1076
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:31,042
You know what, I Never mind.

1077
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:39,227
Listen, Sandy.

1078
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:42,167
I appreciate your
offer. I'm not getting out.

1079
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:50,102
OK. Well, if you think you have to
tell your father and get back in with him,

1080
00:49:50,126 --> 00:49:52,459
then I Keep your money.

1081
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:56,018
Keep your money, bring me in.

1082
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:57,811
We do this properly.

1083
00:49:57,835 --> 00:50:00,602
We'll go fuck my dad together.

1084
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:03,352
Uhhuh.
Takeover.

1085
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,435
Leveraged buyout. Hostile.

1086
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:07,102
That's a dual stock situation.

1087
00:50:07,126 --> 00:50:08,852
That's not gonna be straightforward.

1088
00:50:08,876 --> 00:50:12,227
Price in the toilet,
shareholders are pissed

1089
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:16,018
you and me could force him to the table.

1090
00:50:16,042 --> 00:50:18,143
What about the rest of your family?

1091
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:20,018
Fuck the rest of my family.

1092
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:22,811
Easy to say.
No one has a clue but me.

1093
00:50:22,835 --> 00:50:25,727
I know what to do. I see it all.

1094
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:27,227
We take it apart.

1095
00:50:27,251 --> 00:50:31,435
Fuck local TV, newspapers, parks

1096
00:50:31,459 --> 00:50:34,018
we bulldoze the whole fuckin' shantytown.

1097
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:36,477
We just keep the juiciest morsels,

1098
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:38,269
turn the thing from a pod of rotting whales

1099
00:50:38,293 --> 00:50:40,143
into one bastard great white.

1100
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:41,769
What's your end?

1101
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:45,727
CEO. I'm the only one
who knows the architecture.

1102
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,893
OK? The emotional corporate architecture.

1103
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:51,893
Well, I could like it.
Stewy might not like it.

1104
00:50:51,917 --> 00:50:53,394
Fuck Stewy.

1105
00:50:53,418 --> 00:50:56,227
Stewy will follow the money
like a dog in a cartoon.

1106
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:58,852
And you sure you got the stomach?

1107
00:50:58,876 --> 00:51:00,293
Yeah.

1108
00:51:02,251 --> 00:51:04,334
I'm good.

1109
00:51:32,084 --> 00:51:33,811
Tom.

1110
00:51:33,835 --> 00:51:35,644
Um...
Oh.

1111
00:51:35,668 --> 00:51:36,935
Sorry to wake you.

1112
00:51:36,959 --> 00:51:39,394
Hey. Is everything OK?

1113
00:51:39,418 --> 00:51:40,435
No.

1114
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:42,935
He couldn't catch his breath.

1115
00:51:42,959 --> 00:51:47,352
Listen, we've been advised,
and we are really sorry,

1116
00:51:47,376 --> 00:51:51,585
but I don't think it's a good idea
for him to come to the wedding.

1117
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:55,893
Oh, yeah. That sounds sensible.

1118
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:56,917
Shiv.

1119
00:51:59,293 --> 00:52:01,102
He really is sorry.

1120
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:04,769
Yeah, me too.

1121
00:52:04,793 --> 00:52:07,459
OK, bye.

1122
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:16,227
You OK?

1123
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:19,060
Yeah. I'm great. That's
two less wedding dinners

1124
00:52:19,084 --> 00:52:22,084
for the caterers to have to organize.

1125
00:52:32,209 --> 00:52:33,959
I don't know, Nate.

1126
00:52:37,209 --> 00:52:39,001
I don't fuckin' know.

1127
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:50,686
And I would be your point man on this,

1128
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,143
so you would not have
to deal direct with my dad.

1129
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:56,710
So if we can find a price...

1130
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:02,686
But there's potential? It could happen.

1131
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,852
Well, fuck, I'm excited.

1132
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:06,519
This is great. This is pure upside.

1133
00:53:06,543 --> 00:53:08,209
Thank you.
Awesome, dude.

1134
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:11,477
Let's jerk him around for a bit,

1135
00:53:11,501 --> 00:53:13,293
then throw him back.

1136
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:16,459
This fuckin' family.

1137
00:53:17,835 --> 00:53:19,477
Ooh, hey! Come on.

1138
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:20,751
How's it goin'?

1139
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:29,501
What?

1140
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,126
What, are you psyching me out?

1141
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:46,959
I'm fuckin' terrified.

1142
00:53:49,084 --> 00:53:50,418
Asshole!

1143
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:56,227
Shit.

1144
00:53:56,251 --> 00:53:57,602
If the car doesn't come soon,

1145
00:53:57,626 --> 00:53:59,435
I'm just gonna swim home, I think.

1146
00:53:59,459 --> 00:54:02,977
Greg tells me you swallowed your own load.

1147
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:06,935
Yeah, It was Yeah. It was pretty wild.

1148
00:54:06,959 --> 00:54:09,435
It's cool, though, 'cause
it's like I didn't cheat

1149
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:11,769
'cause all the sperm stayed in my own body.

1150
00:54:11,793 --> 00:54:14,084
Like a closed loop system. So...

1151
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,935
It'd be really nice to see Shiv.

1152
00:54:16,959 --> 00:54:20,352
Willa! Hi, I just want to say I love you.

1153
00:54:20,376 --> 00:54:21,727
I love you so much.

1154
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:23,519
What's happening? Where's the car?

1155
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:25,185
Arriving in five.

1156
00:54:25,209 --> 00:54:26,561
Congratulations, Tom.

1157
00:54:26,585 --> 00:54:30,102
I hear you swallowed your own load.

1158
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:31,435
Yeah, I did.

1159
00:54:31,459 --> 00:54:33,477
It's been a really wonderful night.

1160
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:36,435
I would love a chicken pot pie.

1161
00:54:36,459 --> 00:54:37,644
Thank you.

1162
00:54:37,668 --> 00:54:39,459
OK, honey, bye.

1163
00:54:52,418 --> 00:54:54,477
Hey, Shiv!

1164
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:55,769
I'm home!

1165
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,602
Still got both my eyebrows!

1166
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:59,185
Oh, hi!
Hey.

1167
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:01,977
Hey, you're back... already.

1168
00:55:02,001 --> 00:55:05,352
God, I missed you,
honey. God, I missed you.

1169
00:55:05,376 --> 00:55:07,811
I missed you.
How was it?

1170
00:55:07,835 --> 00:55:10,310
Which Oh, the party? Yeah.

1171
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:11,310
It was a blast.

1172
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:13,018
Yeah?
Yeah.

1173
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:17,060
So... what happened?

1174
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:19,769
You know, just...

1175
00:55:19,793 --> 00:55:22,060
like, this and that.

1176
00:55:22,084 --> 00:55:23,519
Usual. Normal stuff.

1177
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:25,876
Specifically what, Tom?

1178
00:55:28,835 --> 00:55:31,227
Wait, what? No. Shiv, you

1179
00:55:31,251 --> 00:55:33,561
I thought you said.

1180
00:55:33,585 --> 00:55:35,686
Oh, honey, I'm shitting you.

1181
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:36,959
Oh, my God, OK.

1182
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,917
Oh, it's good to have you back.

1183
00:55:51,501 --> 00:55:53,310
Yeah, Frank.

1184
00:55:53,334 --> 00:55:55,352
Those girls from the art thing,

1185
00:55:55,376 --> 00:55:58,227
I want you to put the
word around they're junkies,

1186
00:55:58,251 --> 00:56:00,769
they're sluts, they're
shooting seed capital

1187
00:56:00,793 --> 00:56:03,269
straight into their arms.

1188
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,751
Let's sink them.

1189
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:33,917
Gentlemen. Shall we?

1190
00:56:36,418 --> 00:56:37,585
My man.
