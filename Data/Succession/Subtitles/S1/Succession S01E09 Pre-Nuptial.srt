1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,897
He's got me overseeing
the satellite launch

2
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:03,171
out of Tanegashima.

3
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:05,481
- Good for you, bro.
- Can't keep a good dog down.

4
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,452
Bill told me
as part of the handover

5
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,000
where some of the bodies were buried.

6
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:12,565
If it does come out while
I'm in charge, I'm dead.

7
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,737
I'm tired of this. Come in.

8
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,541
I can see through you and this
transparent little offer to buy me off.

9
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,581
Maybe, I should just let them
come for you.

10
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,918
If this is the way things
are gonna go then fuck off, Dad.

11
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:24,662
Shiv gave me a hall pass.

12
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:26,284
And what?
Shiv has that same arrangement?

13
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:28,432
I don't know, Greg.
It's not a competition.

14
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:30,873
I don't think
it's a good idea for him

15
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:31,897
to come to the wedding.

16
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:35,456
How would you like half a bill
for your share of Waystar?

17
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,605
Why don't we talk this over with Sandy?

18
00:00:37,856 --> 00:00:39,248
Sandy Furness?

19
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,957
He's already in on Waystar.

20
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:43,206
I have the shell company attached

21
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,814
to his private equity fund.

22
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:48,581
Keep your money. Bring me in.

23
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:49,981
We go fuck my dad together.

24
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:52,123
Leverage buyout. Hostile.

25
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:53,832
- What's your end?
- CEO.

26
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:55,647
And you're sure you got the stomach?

27
00:00:57,313 --> 00:00:58,522
Yeah. I'm good.

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,355
Here they are!

29
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:51,289
What's he do... What's he doing?

30
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:52,414
Come on, it'll be fine.

31
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:53,748
It'll fit!

32
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:56,082
I'm afraid he's not gonna drive through.

33
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:58,373
- He says it won't fit.
- Well, clearly it'll fit.

34
00:01:58,397 --> 00:02:00,022
What is he, vehicle dysmorphic?

35
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:03,040
The bridge has a three-and-a-half
ton weight limit,

36
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:04,540
and he's worried about his mirrors.

37
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:05,998
Well, which is it, Charlotte?

38
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:07,373
The story keeps changing.

39
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:09,082
Hey, hey! Come on down!

40
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:11,748
This is not my intended welcome.

41
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:13,248
We will... We will sort it, Tom.

42
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:14,581
Hey!

43
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:17,998
- Morning!
- Hey, good to see ya.

44
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,676
We can just get buggies and...

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,414
Buggies? How the fuck long
will that take?

46
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:23,373
We just need to round up
the buggies and...

47
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:26,206
I work in hospitality, Charlotte,
so I can smell bullshit.

48
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,790
- Mom!
- Honey!

49
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:30,373
Hey! Hey, Daddy!

50
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:31,714
Hey, Tommy, it's great to see ya.

51
00:02:31,738 --> 00:02:32,777
Couple of hours?!

52
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:34,957
It was wonderful
just sitting there.

53
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,384
We liked watching the planes.

54
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:38,959
Your father thought he might
have seen the man from U2.

55
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:41,167
- OK.
- And Arthur Laffer,

56
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:43,584
of the Laffer Curve? Are they coming?

57
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:46,918
Well, uh, could be. It's mostly
rock gods and economists.

58
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:49,348
Hey, hey, it's the Fly Guys!

59
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,709
- Good to see you!
- You made it, man!

60
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,626
Tommy, your mother's a little thirsty.

61
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,084
- Mommy, you thirsty?
- A little thirsty.

62
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:01,459
I don't want to be a trouble, Tom.
It was my fault.

63
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,793
Grab a bag, and then we'll go...

64
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,233
I'll follow you up.

65
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:07,959
I hope you're happy now, Charlotte,

66
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:09,417
'cause my mother is dying of thirst.

67
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:11,042
And I've just picked up a bag.

68
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,682
I'm carrying a case on my wedding eve.

69
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,501
All right. I gotta go.

70
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,417
But I'll see you there, OK?

71
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:54,876
I managed to change
the time for the embassy,

72
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,233
and...

73
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:02,167
- Sorry. Are we OK?
- Oh, yeah.

74
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:04,125
Gil, you don't
have to come to the wedding

75
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:05,417
if you're too busy. That's...

76
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:06,542
We've just been doing

77
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:08,209
the media monitoring.

78
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:11,000
Motherfuckers. I'll fucking kill him.

79
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,876
I'll take them to pieces!

80
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,542
He's not sleeping.

81
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:17,292
It's what's-his-name.
Got under his skin.

82
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:19,125
Screwdriver-face.

83
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:20,793
Oh, the bit...

84
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:23,000
The bit where he implied
he murdered his wife.

85
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:26,292
Yeah, for some reason
that's somewhat irked him.

86
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:30,084
Gil, you don't need to focus on this.
We can hit it.

87
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:31,542
I know. I'm focused.

88
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:34,668
I'm X-raying this briefing
for salient facts.

89
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,125
I mean, I don't want to make
a big thing out of this,

90
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:38,709
but is it possible your father

91
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:42,000
is the worst human being who ever lived?

92
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:43,668
Uh, I... I don't think that's...

93
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:45,417
Is it true he's not
coming to the wedding,

94
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:47,775
out of... what, spite?

95
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,125
Well, it's complicated.

96
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,751
I want to take him out.

97
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:53,876
I want to destroy ATN.

98
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,417
I'm not sure that's wise.

99
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,292
And if I said it was wise,

100
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,775
would you have a problem with that?

101
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:03,918
No.

102
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:05,876
In the end, Gil,
I'll do whatever you want.

103
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,501
Siobhan, look. If there's something,

104
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,858
anything, you can get me,

105
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,918
I'm in a fuckin' knife fight here,

106
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:16,149
I'm holding a dildo
made out of American cheese.

107
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:37,209
So this is really
gonna happen, yeah?

108
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:41,542
You know I don't want ICBC as
part of the syndicate, right?

109
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:45,250
Uh, 75 to 150 basis points,

110
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,376
and point two percent commitment fee.

111
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,584
Then, uh, then, yeah. Fuck yeah.

112
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:51,793
- I feel good.
- Holy shit.

113
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:54,668
Without them we're good to go.
Let me call you back.

114
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:58,668
Um, has your sister
ever heard of Lake Como?

115
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:02,376
Has she ever heard of Venice,
St. Barts, the Maldives?

116
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,793
Has she heard of these locations?
She must be aware of them.

117
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:06,834
I got the call. You get the call?

118
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:08,483
I got the fuckin' call.

119
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:13,334
Shall we go inside? Come on.

120
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,084
What? In here?

121
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:19,209
Brother, we are putting
together a hostile takeover

122
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,668
of one of the largest media corporations

123
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:22,959
in the world.

124
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:26,024
I think we can brave
some non-vintage champagne.

125
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:32,376
Wow. Um, can we get some champagne?

126
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,459
A bottle, please? Thank you.

127
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:36,876
What are we talkin'? Like ten days?

128
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,292
Then we go in for the kill?

129
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:40,000
- Yeah.
- Can't keep it on lockdown

130
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:41,709
for more than about ten days, right?

131
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:44,042
- Yeah, that's about it.
- John?

132
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:47,542
- John? John!
- So, like...

133
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:48,876
Have you got any that champagne?

134
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,417
The 19th for the bear hug?

135
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:52,918
- Yeah. Good. One little thing.
- Good.

136
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:57,459
The Canadians, there seems to be
a little static on some details.

137
00:07:57,483 --> 00:08:01,209
- Like what?
- Like... you as CEO.

138
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,876
What do you mean?

139
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,542
Relax. OK?

140
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,209
This doesn't happen without you.

141
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,542
It's normal co-investor bullshit.

142
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:12,501
- Frank knows those guys. You want me to...
- I'll handle it, dude.

143
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,876
No leaks. Please.
Not to Frank, not to anyone.

144
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,751
Why are you so jumpy about this, Ken?

145
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,584
Why am I jumpy?

146
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:22,959
About fucking Rome,
fuckin' Shiv and Connor,

147
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:26,959
probably blowing what's left
of my dad's fuckin' brain?

148
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:30,751
About taking the company
out of family control, forever?

149
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:34,167
I don't know, Stewy.
Why would that make me jumpy?

150
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:35,876
Look, I don't give a fuck.

151
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,376
But, I mean, do you want me to ask?

152
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,542
I'm just curious to see
if she's gonna come begging.

153
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:42,584
- Because I can ask.
- I don't want to ask.

154
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,959
If she wants to ask, she can ask.

155
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,250
'Cause I can physically see her.

156
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,084
Gerri, I don't want to ask.

157
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:52,417
OK.

158
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:53,959
She comes crawling,

159
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:55,751
then I'll think it over.

160
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,793
- Fine. OK, I get it.
- Who's there?

161
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,959
- Um...
- Have you seen Caroline?

162
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:04,125
Is she still with
that chinless hippie prick?

163
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,584
I thought we might miss the rehearsal.

164
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:09,084
We don't need to rehearse.
We're gonna kill it.

165
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,831
Did you think again about your dad

166
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:12,250
and whether we want to reconsider...

167
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:14,125
- Fuck him.
- Right, right.

168
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:17,000
And did you think again about
whether we want to go Wambsgans

169
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,459
or Roy-Wambsgans or, as I said,

170
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,626
I'd be willing to just drop traditional

171
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,834
and go Tom Roy,
in fact, for myself, if...

172
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,417
Um, hey, I wanted to ask you something.

173
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:30,834
Uh-huh?

174
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:35,626
I could do with knowing
about the bad thing in Cruises.

175
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,292
You know, the thing that meant
you couldn't sleep?

176
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:39,542
Uh-huh.

177
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:42,876
- No?
- Uh... I...

178
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,250
No, I don't...

179
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:45,918
No, I just think, yeah,

180
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:48,417
I just think, you know,
church and state and...

181
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,626
and AC/DC and...

182
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,751
ebony and ivory
and never the twain shall meet.

183
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, right, but you always
wanted to make it public.

184
00:09:57,024 --> 00:09:59,167
- Didn't you?
- Yes. Yeah.

185
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:02,167
- In my bones, I did.
- Exactly.

186
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:06,139
But I did then destroy
all the evidence, so...

187
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,668
I guess... you know, if it's bad,

188
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,459
the longer you leave it,

189
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,501
the worse it'll be when it comes out.

190
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:19,084
Yes, unless
it never comes out. You know?

191
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,209
I bet it's not even that bad.

192
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,459
Uh, it is quite bad.

193
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:25,566
It's quite bad.

194
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,417
- Oh, fuck, here we go.
- Look, honey.

195
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:33,709
This is where it's happening.

196
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,858
Ooh.

197
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:38,250
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

198
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:41,000
- It's exciting!
- Hey.

199
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:44,709
You spoken to the Wicked
Bitch of the West yet?

200
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,042
I just got here, Shiv.

201
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:48,900
Is this gonna take long?

202
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,608
Shall we?

203
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:56,751
- Saddle up, soldier.
- Oh, come on.

204
00:10:56,775 --> 00:10:58,376
She can't be that bad.

205
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,542
Yeah, just don't look at her directly.

206
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:03,542
Hello! Hello, hello!

207
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:06,334
- Hi.
- Here you are.

208
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:07,584
I knew you'd arrive eventually.

209
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:09,250
Tom. Remember Tabs?

210
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:11,751
- My mom.
- Hello!

211
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:12,942
- Tom.
- Hi.

212
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,417
Gosh, look at you.

213
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,209
You're very plausible.

214
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,250
Oh. Thank you.

215
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:22,098
Exactly.

216
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:26,292
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Kendall.

217
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:28,125
Tabitha, have you guys met?

218
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,542
- Have you all...
- Bro.

219
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:30,959
Ruff ruff! Ruff!

220
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,584
So, shall we go and play happy families?

221
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:36,042
Yes. Great.

222
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,501
Mm-hmm.

223
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:39,918
Well done on Tom.

224
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:42,417
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

225
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:44,626
Tell me again why you're marrying him.

226
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,167
- Mom. Come on.
- Joking. I like...

227
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,459
- I like him!
- OK.

228
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:52,959
And I want to say
I hope this can be nice.

229
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:55,292
I really appreciate
your coming over here.

230
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,417
OK. It's no worries.

231
00:11:57,441 --> 00:12:00,584
My travel agent
specializes in guilt trips.

232
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:02,167
Hey! Hey!

233
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:05,167
Apologies. Did I miss anything?

234
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,167
- No.
- Happy day.

235
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:11,793
Caroline Collingwood.
Pleased to meet you.

236
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:14,334
Likewise, your excellency.

237
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,334
Gregory Hirsch.

238
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:17,834
Greg!

239
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:20,918
- You're Greg Egg.
- Excuse me?

240
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:22,668
You're Greg the Egg!

241
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:25,250
When you were born you looked
like a little misshapen egg.

242
00:12:25,274 --> 00:12:28,834
I... did... Yeah, I did hear tell of...

243
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:34,348
Oh, God. And your dad used to try and
sleep with all the men in Sausalito.

244
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:39,459
How's your mother?

245
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,000
Uh, good. OK, yeah.

246
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:43,959
Solvent, currently. Debt free.

247
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:46,376
Great. Come on in.

248
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,348
Come and see our little church.

249
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:54,000
These are all my disreputable
slave-owning ancestors.

250
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,692
Very nice.

251
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:01,959
- Oh, my God. Tom, did you see?
- What, Greg?

252
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:04,918
- Did I see what?
- That's the girl from Brooklyn.

253
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:06,417
From your bachelor party.

254
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:08,793
Who sucked your dick and
made you swallow your load.

255
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:10,626
Greg, that's not very wedding-y.

256
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,292
- But that's her.
- I know.

257
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:15,376
Greg, her name is Tabitha,
and she and Roman are dating.

258
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,108
Which is cool. So please, do not
act like an unsophisticated rube.

259
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,167
- OK. Wow.
- Yeah.

260
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:23,709
He really liked her, and it's fine.

261
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,417
It's just one of
those weird urban things,

262
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:27,250
like when you go to see standup

263
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,125
and the comedian is your dentist.

264
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,250
- OK? Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah... Oh!

265
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:33,084
- Hey!
- Hey.

266
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:34,668
- Hey!
- So,

267
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:37,233
- we should, uh, get going.
- Yeah, let's do it.

268
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:42,733
I'm Willa, by the way.
I'm Connor's partner.

269
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,834
Fantastic. And what do you do, Willa?

270
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,566
Oh, um, I'm a playwright.

271
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:52,167
- Wow. Fantastic.
- Yeah.

272
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:54,668
- Thank you.
- America.

273
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,918
And what do you do, Connor?

274
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:58,918
Well, um...

275
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:02,751
Connor doesn't really do anything.

276
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,274
Do you, Con?

277
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:09,292
I think they're all
gathered now, Patrick.

278
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,108
- Shall we?
- What?

279
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:14,942
What?

280
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:18,250
Shit.

281
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,000
Just to get things straight,

282
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:23,084
am I right that the father...
I understand the father...

283
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:24,390
Couldn't be bothered.

284
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,584
He's... He's not well. He's not well.

285
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:29,292
Yeah, that's the story.

286
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:31,108
Everyone remember the story.

287
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:37,292
So, uh, I will be performing
the father role.

288
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:39,274
Great.

289
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:51,417
Listen, I didn't mean you
don't do anything. Just...

290
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:54,376
Well, that's a shame,
because that's what you said.

291
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,292
No, you know, I mean, nothing
like my writing. Nothing...

292
00:14:57,316 --> 00:15:00,876
Safeguarding 30,000 acres of
wilderness, that's nothing?

293
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,334
Being on the verge of setting up
a podcast on Napoleonic history

294
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:07,292
with a considerable level of
investment interest, that's nothing?

295
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:09,276
- No, sure, it's...
- Crackin' the nut of happiness

296
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,209
like a modern day Thoreau,
well, that's nothing.

297
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:14,542
Con. You're great, OK?

298
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:16,751
You are. I...

299
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:19,149
It was a dumb thing to say.

300
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:22,668
Well, here we are.

301
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:25,125
The ancestral home
Caroline didn't inherit.

302
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,834
The thorn in her side,
the fishbone in her throat.

303
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:30,692
When we were kids, she wouldn't
even let us look at it.

304
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:33,668
What do you think?

305
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:36,793
I mean, it's massive!

306
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:38,334
I hate it.

307
00:15:38,358 --> 00:15:41,459
- Hey, so, listen.
- Mm-hmm?

308
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,834
You know the Canadians, right?

309
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:45,292
Yves, et cetera?

310
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:47,279
The pension fund guys?

311
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:48,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

312
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:51,334
What do they think of me?

313
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:54,334
How do you mean? What's the context?

314
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:56,459
I can't give you context.

315
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:59,274
OK. That's very interesting context.

316
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:04,098
- Look, as a pal...
- Uh-huh?

317
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:09,709
Say there was a situation
where private equity

318
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:12,417
was trying to buy out
a major media company

319
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:14,292
and install a new CEO.

320
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:16,125
- How would they view me?
- Are you serious?

321
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:19,125
Fuck. So what, they're co-investors?

322
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:20,542
Come on, you know those guys.

323
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,542
Behind closed doors,
are they of the opinion

324
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,751
I'm the real deal,

325
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,751
or in training?

326
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:30,834
And would there be room
to wet the beak of an old pal

327
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:33,793
- in such a situation?
- Frank, too soon. Too soon.

328
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:35,167
Get your hard-on out of my soup.

329
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:36,207
OK.

330
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,709
- So?
- Well...

331
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,334
I think they have a lot of time for you,

332
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:43,584
but there may be certain questions.

333
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:46,084
- Oh, shit.
- Well, you know,

334
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:47,751
they think they're hot shots.

335
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:49,775
They make hard jokes.

336
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,501
As in?

337
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:57,334
Well, sometimes when you were absent

338
00:16:57,358 --> 00:17:00,775
they used to refer to you
as "the calamari cock ring."

339
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:04,250
I don't even know what that means.

340
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,876
I think it means they think
of me as a cock ring

341
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,000
made from calamari, Frank,

342
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:10,793
it's pretty self-explanatory.

343
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,834
- So what do we say?
- Well, I thought

344
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:14,668
we were gonna say "illness."

345
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:16,125
No, I don't like illness. Plays weak.

346
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:17,858
OK, we can say "busy."

347
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:21,125
What prick's too busy to attend
his own daughter's wedding?

348
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:23,042
OK, "family rift."

349
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:26,959
But we background brief that
Gil's campaign is like a cult.

350
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:31,626
"What is this grieving senator's
mysterious hold on Shiv Roy?"

351
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,125
We sprinkle some of that.

352
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:35,834
It makes her look weak.
And it makes me look like I'm...

353
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:38,417
None of my kids have gone round
the bend, or offed themselves.

354
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,626
We've always pushed
that you're a good dad.

355
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,793
- Because?
- Because you are a good dad.

356
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:44,959
Huh.

357
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:48,042
So, if you don't want to say, I mean,

358
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,709
work or illness or...

359
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,000
rift, do we just...

360
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:55,542
Fuck it. There's no way out.

361
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:57,459
I mean, if you want to go...

362
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,125
I don't want to go.

363
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:03,264
But there's no other fucking way out.

364
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:10,709
We can do whatever you want us to do,

365
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:13,334
and I'm so sorry if you think
we've done the wrong thing,

366
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,834
but they literally just called
and told us he was coming.

367
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:19,042
- Who's coming?
- Dad. And Marcia.

368
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:22,525
- Wait... Dad's coming... here?
- Yeah.

369
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:26,125
I thought you didn't want him to.

370
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:27,167
I don't.

371
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,876
I mean, it's your wedding, so...

372
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,084
Yeah. I don't want him here.

373
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,584
He's never apologized.

374
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:33,668
But Marcia called Tom, and...

375
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,751
And obviously I had to ask Shiv.

376
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:38,250
Meanwhile, she's already
called Charlotte,

377
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:40,626
- and they're on their way.
- Dad's coming?

378
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,042
Is it about the launch? Is he concerned?

379
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:45,209
Yeah, I'm sure he's
thinking about that 24/7.

380
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:47,876
So, I mean, what are you gonna do?

381
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,542
- You could just say no.
- Yeah. I could.

382
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:54,376
But what, just get security
to fucking stop him?

383
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,292
- Hold on.
- I could do that.

384
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:58,876
Yeah you could, but it might
cause a funny atmosphere,

385
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,042
because he did pay for all this.

386
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:04,209
If he's got the stones to walk
in here, what are we gonna do?

387
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:07,000
Put the dogs on him? Tell him
there's no seat, he's gotta stand?

388
00:19:07,024 --> 00:19:08,692
He's given us no choice.

389
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,376
So now I hear he is coming.

390
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,209
- Yeah.
- Well, that's wonderful.

391
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,084
- Oh, come on, Mom.
- No, no. It's fine.

392
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:20,626
I just hope you won't forget about me

393
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,042
when your father arrives

394
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:25,250
with the head of his
Middle Eastern operations.

395
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:27,918
- Marcia?
- Yeah, Marcia.

396
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:31,608
Do you still find her
a bit...? You know.

397
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:37,793
Actually, we became quite
close during Dad's illness.

398
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:39,167
Oh, well.

399
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:41,709
What a sweet little scene
that must have been.

400
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,584
Very touching, I'm sure.

401
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:47,084
- Actually, it's quite good.
- Why?

402
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:50,900
Just your being the second-most
important person at your wedding.

403
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,056
Take the pressure off.

404
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:08,292
Mm. Oh, this is delicious.

405
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:10,167
Well, I'm very glad you like it.

406
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:11,918
Because it cost a pretty penny.

407
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:15,024
Well, it's delicious. It tastes like it.

408
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,959
- Um, sorry. Just a second?
- Oh, no. Of course.

409
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:21,250
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hi there.

410
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:24,376
Got any protein for us to use?

411
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,417
Protein? I'm not a fuckin' hen
to lay you eggs.

412
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:31,751
- I'm a strategist.
- I know. It's just... Gil.

413
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,417
- What?
- He'd like a word.

414
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,464
OK.

415
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:53,000
- Hey. Hey!
- Hey. How ya doin'?

416
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:55,959
I gotta say, you knocked it
out of the park with the wine.

417
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:57,542
It's delicious.

418
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,584
Gil.

419
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:02,084
Listen, I don't mean
to be overly dramatic,

420
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:04,209
but I was assured when I accepted

421
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,918
that your father wouldn't be here.

422
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:08,626
I know. Plans changed, I was ambushed.

423
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,167
This is not OK from my POV, Siobhan.

424
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:12,668
This compromises me.

425
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:15,000
And you were very eager
that Gil would come along.

426
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,209
I mean, it's...

427
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,834
Well, yeah, when I invited you

428
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,709
I didn't realize
it was gonna be a chore.

429
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:21,209
He's just weighty, Shiv.

430
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,334
He carries his gravity.

431
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:25,501
He's not a man, he's a fucking planet.

432
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:27,542
Look, there's no press,
and there's no pictures.

433
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:30,584
We got jammers and a fucking
hawk to take out drones.

434
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:31,900
It'll be like it never happened.

435
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,417
I hear you might have
something explosive

436
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,709
I can use.

437
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,834
Yeah, maybe. I'm working on it.

438
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:40,191
But just not yet.

439
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,751
Let's destroy ATN, Shiv.

440
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:46,209
Wouldn't that be a nice wedding gift

441
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:47,417
to the American people?

442
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:48,834
Oh, yeah, sure,

443
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:50,709
I'm just concerned
about collateral damage.

444
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:53,292
- Tom.
- Tom?

445
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:55,292
- He'll be fine.
- Says the man

446
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:57,604
who has literally no idea
what he's even talking about.

447
00:21:57,628 --> 00:21:58,959
Shiv, come on.

448
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:02,584
I have all the arguments
on monopolies, and news,

449
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:04,709
and the coarsening of the public sphere,

450
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:07,084
but I kind of start falling asleep

451
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:08,668
when I hear myself talk.

452
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:11,376
Give me something salty, Shiv.
Get me a stick of dynamite

453
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,542
I can shove up his fuckin' ass!

454
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,084
OK, I get that.

455
00:22:15,108 --> 00:22:17,584
Come here. You know Gil.

456
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:19,084
Yeah, sure.

457
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:20,709
Pleased to meet you, Senator Eavis.

458
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:22,501
Likewise.

459
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:25,084
How are you finding it
outside the evil empire?

460
00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:27,417
Oh, fine. I'm fine, thank you.

461
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:29,584
And how do you like it
here in the lion's den?

462
00:22:29,608 --> 00:22:31,167
Oh, I've been to zoos before.

463
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:33,918
You like drinking our champagne?

464
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:36,542
I'm a "champagne for all" guy,

465
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:38,751
not a "gruel for all" guy.

466
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,834
Hey, you know Senator Eavis.

467
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:42,751
Sword of the dispossessed

468
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:44,793
and lover of vintage champagne.

469
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:47,209
I guess technically,
I should take a swing at you.

470
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,501
Technically, I should
call you libelous scum.

471
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:51,417
Are you gonna calm the shit-talk down,

472
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:53,459
or are we gonna have to ramp things up?

473
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:56,959
Is your dad gonna stop poisoning the
discourse of our great republic?

474
00:22:56,983 --> 00:22:58,584
Have you got a laptop?

475
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:01,292
Do you see the shit out there?
We're the fucking good guys now.

476
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:03,793
Join in, by the way. Feel free.

477
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,459
No?

478
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:08,626
Shiv? I mean, your guy here
is shit-talkin' our company.

479
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,959
Oh, yeah, we don't talk about that.

480
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:13,292
That would be a conflict of interest.

481
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:14,918
Oh, lies!

482
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:17,250
Oh, 'cause you... Yeah, the lies.

483
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:20,209
Can't wait for the big one
tomorrow. Right?

484
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:23,209
Well, these hands
aren't gonna fuck themselves.

485
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:26,024
Nice to meet you, Senator Beavis.

486
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:37,417
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

487
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:40,376
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Tom Wambsgans.

488
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,209
Obviously. Nate.

489
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:43,876
Uh-huh. Right.

490
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,209
Right.

491
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,918
I just wanted to say
thanks for having me.

492
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:49,793
I'm Tabitha.

493
00:23:49,817 --> 00:23:52,334
Hi. Well, I've heard
very little about you.

494
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:54,376
What can I say?

495
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,417
Best man won.

496
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:57,918
Ha ha. As in?

497
00:23:57,942 --> 00:23:59,668
You won the Shiv-off, pal.

498
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:00,793
Good luck.

499
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:03,692
Right. And who... who are you again?

500
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:07,125
Nate? Sofrelli?

501
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:10,167
Did she never... This is embarrassing.

502
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:14,042
- Are you a pal of Kendall's?
- Yes.

503
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:16,042
- OK. Ah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

504
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:18,668
And Shiv and I, uh,
back in ancient history we...

505
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:20,250
Oh, right. Oh! Oh, I see.

506
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:21,834
Oh, OK, maybe she did.

507
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:23,292
- Right.
- Maybe she did.

508
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:25,751
Ah. The best man won.

509
00:24:25,775 --> 00:24:27,733
Maybe.

510
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:34,834
There was an uncle who ended up
living in Gibraltar with a monkey,

511
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:38,876
and he swindled my mom's grandpa.

512
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,125
We used to come here as kids.
She lives nearby.

513
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,566
Oh, very good. Keep the
wound fresh and all that.

514
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:48,376
You know what, I'm gonna split.

515
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,668
I can see my husband-to-be
talking to my ex,

516
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:52,542
and it's making me feel
like I want to hurl.

517
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:54,608
- So, great to meet you.
- Yeah, fair. You too.

518
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,149
Have a good night.

519
00:25:00,274 --> 00:25:02,250
Just to say...

520
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:05,626
so kind of your parents to have
paid for all this delicious wine.

521
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,167
Oh, not at all, not at all.

522
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:09,250
They wanted to make
a contribution, so...

523
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:13,376
So clever the way they're letting
every single person know.

524
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,108
Oh. Oh, good...

525
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:21,125
You OK?

526
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:23,250
Yeah, I think I just
got stabbed by your mom,

527
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:24,959
but I'm not completely sure.

528
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,250
Oh, yeah, that's how it works.

529
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,292
You'll bleed out in about an hour.

530
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:31,417
Can I... Can I talk to you
for... two seconds?

531
00:25:31,441 --> 00:25:33,108
Uh, yeah.

532
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:38,751
So I just wanted to get you up here

533
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:40,959
to talk about the table plans.

534
00:25:40,983 --> 00:25:43,542
Oh. And have you thought
any more about... Ow!

535
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:46,417
Whether you want to tell me
about the secret thing?

536
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:48,793
And I just wanted to, uh, say...

537
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:52,650
that I, uh, I did meet Nate.

538
00:25:55,316 --> 00:25:56,501
Oh, you...

539
00:25:56,525 --> 00:25:58,441
You've met Nate before. I think.

540
00:25:59,983 --> 00:26:02,125
No? Oh.

541
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:04,334
Uh... Oh, well, he's a...

542
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:06,167
you know, he's a good colleague,

543
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:08,751
and, uh, he's a friend of Kendall's.

544
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,918
They ran around in Shanghai together.

545
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:12,292
And he's a dick.

546
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:13,626
Well, he's OK, but he has

547
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,584
a certain dickish quality about him.

548
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:19,250
- Uh-huh.
- I think I've mentioned him...

549
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:20,900
to you before.

550
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,358
Look, Shiv, uh...

551
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:33,167
Is this real?

552
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,501
What do you... What do you mean?

553
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:38,959
Am I... Am I a total jerk?

554
00:26:38,983 --> 00:26:41,626
- Uh...
- Do you really want to do this?

555
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,626
'Cause we don't have to.

556
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,334
Do this?

557
00:26:45,358 --> 00:26:49,125
- All the people are here.
- Yeah.

558
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,668
And... besides, I want to.

559
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:53,566
I do... I do want to.

560
00:26:54,692 --> 00:26:56,692
I mean, is this...

561
00:26:57,942 --> 00:26:59,834
W-What level are we on?

562
00:26:59,858 --> 00:27:01,334
Are you fucking around on me?

563
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:03,668
- Tom.
- Honestly?

564
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:05,959
This Nate...

565
00:27:05,983 --> 00:27:08,066
you know, I can...

566
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,376
I can... There are vibes.

567
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,709
Oh, Tom. What, as soon
as two colleagues are close...

568
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:17,876
D.C. loves gossip.

569
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,000
No, sure.

570
00:27:19,024 --> 00:27:20,542
Sometimes there are rumors,

571
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:24,250
and people, you know,
they're not fucking.

572
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:26,066
But sometimes they totally are.

573
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:30,733
Honestly?

574
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:37,900
This is real.

575
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:42,566
I'm not fucking around on you.

576
00:27:52,024 --> 00:27:54,417
Well, I trust you.

577
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:56,066
Good.

578
00:27:57,608 --> 00:27:59,918
Thank you.

579
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:02,584
And that put... puts my mind at rest.

580
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:04,817
So...

581
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:11,918
You know, when...

582
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:15,274
when we met, I was in such a mess.

583
00:28:17,858 --> 00:28:20,566
I need you. Hmm?

584
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:23,483
I do.

585
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:29,441
I...

586
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,000
If you want to know
about the secret stuff,

587
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:36,692
the cruise line stuff, I'll tell you.

588
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:41,000
Because we have to be able to trust.

589
00:28:41,024 --> 00:28:42,125
Right?

590
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:44,334
Yeah?

591
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:46,149
Yeah, that'd be great.

592
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,125
- Hey. Hey. How ya doin'?
- Hi.

593
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:03,542
- Where are the kids?
- They're upstairs.

594
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:04,834
- Cool.
- They're sleeping.

595
00:29:04,858 --> 00:29:06,668
- Yeah. Right.
- I saw Shiv.

596
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,793
How are the happy couple? OK?

597
00:29:08,817 --> 00:29:11,751
Good, you know, maintaining the veneer.

598
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:14,000
Mm-hmm. You OK?

599
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:17,084
I'm fantastic. I did, like,

600
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:20,668
120 push-ups this morning,
so, yeah, I think I'm OK.

601
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,000
Wow. Wow. You did 120 push-ups.

602
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:24,754
Rava, I just have
a lot goin' on right now.

603
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:31,668
It's not...

604
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:34,525
not one of your
more relaxing interludes?

605
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,167
Yeah. It's not.

606
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:41,709
I'm, uh, I'm a big fuckin' stress knot.
What can I tell you?

607
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:45,149
I probably have a tumor
eating me inside-out.

608
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,358
You want another drink?

609
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,459
Your lawyers have gotten
a little quiet on me,

610
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:53,793
so I'm just wondering if that's...

611
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:55,167
Oh, yeah, I don't know about that.

612
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:57,376
Can you maybe give them a little nudge?

613
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Sure.

614
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,042
I'll give them a nudge.

615
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,584
Ken. Ken.

616
00:30:04,608 --> 00:30:05,709
Hmm?

617
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:09,751
- I know you...
- Oh, yeah, you do?

618
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:10,959
- Yeah, I know you.
- Really.

619
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:13,626
And if you want to talk, I am here.

620
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,793
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

621
00:30:14,817 --> 00:30:17,191
Well, I'm good.

622
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,191
Hmm.

623
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,918
Yeah, you know what,

624
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:27,709
the truth is my lawyers are stonewalling

625
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:30,417
because your lawyers
are trying to fuck me over.

626
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:33,417
So shall we just leave it to them,

627
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:36,292
and then you and me can just flirt

628
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:39,709
and you can do your whole
la-dee-fuckin'-da smile

629
00:30:39,733 --> 00:30:43,042
and we can just be all chummy and
everything because I love all that shit?

630
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:45,376
Have a fuckin' line
if you need one that badly.

631
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,417
Yeah, I will, OK?

632
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:47,793
- Fuck you.
- Thanks.

633
00:30:47,817 --> 00:30:49,834
Everything isn't what you think.
You know?

634
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:52,811
You can't see inside me just 'cause
I've told you the occasional...

635
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,483
Sorry.

636
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,548
Well, well, well. What the
fuck's going on here?

637
00:31:25,572 --> 00:31:28,042
This looks mighty fucking cozy.

638
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,709
Um... hi. Hi, Kendall.

639
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:32,876
- Hi.
- We were just...

640
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,834
well, we were just saying that I think
that the first time I came here

641
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:38,125
was back when you guys
were kids, like...

642
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:39,793
maybe 1986, I think?

643
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:41,793
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.
- Remember that?

644
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:45,167
Right. Great.

645
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:48,959
Sorry. I'm sorry. I should, uh...

646
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:50,626
circulate.

647
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,250
- OK.
- All rightie.

648
00:31:52,274 --> 00:31:54,316
- We'll see ya later.
- Yep.

649
00:31:57,066 --> 00:32:01,459
Well, I'm happy to tell, but
do we have to do it tonight?

650
00:32:01,483 --> 00:32:04,793
You know, 'cause it's about the
corporate cover-up of crimes

651
00:32:04,817 --> 00:32:07,125
and institutionalized sexual abuse.

652
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:08,584
Oh, fuck.

653
00:32:08,608 --> 00:32:12,501
Well... bad for Dad. Great for Gil.

654
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:14,876
It's not very "wedding-y."

655
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,858
Yeah, still...

656
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:21,848
OK. So...

657
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,334
there were payoffs,

658
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:27,250
there was...

659
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:30,209
legal and semi-illegal intimidation...

660
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:33,167
And do you personally
have plausible deniability?

661
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:35,000
Yes, I think so. Yeah.

662
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:36,542
Digital deep-clean,

663
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:38,584
and I shredded the paper material.

664
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:40,125
- Great.
- An outside team.

665
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:42,459
And inside, signed
the paper out... Greg.

666
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:43,793
- Greg.
- Yeah.

667
00:32:43,817 --> 00:32:45,501
Just thought family would be safest,

668
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,042
and Greg's expendable. You know.

669
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,834
What, you'd... kill Greg?

670
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:51,959
No. But you know, he's family, right?

671
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:54,358
- So we shut him up.
- Yeah, OK, right.

672
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,751
What are you gonna do with this?

673
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:01,042
'Cause if I give you the details,

674
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:03,942
it could really hurt me, Shiv.

675
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:09,191
You're not gonna let me get hurt?

676
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:12,274
No.

677
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,692
I'll need specifics.

678
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:19,918
OK.

679
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:21,400
So...

680
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:23,566
So.

681
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:05,608
Keep him away from me.

682
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:14,441
Your father's making a
subtle entrance... as I see.

683
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:20,167
Hey.

684
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,084
Come on. Forbidden fruit.

685
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:24,292
Nate.

686
00:34:24,316 --> 00:34:26,918
Has the chicken laid the egg?

687
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,358
Uh, no. Not yet. No joy.

688
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:36,316
Look at you.

689
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:43,459
I'm desperate to make you concentrate

690
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:46,417
on nothing but me for just 15 minutes.

691
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:48,858
You think I used to concentrate on you?

692
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:52,358
Nate.

693
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,334
So, Greg Egg.

694
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:14,584
- Ah.
- How long do you give it?

695
00:35:14,608 --> 00:35:16,084
I'm sorry?

696
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:18,793
The marriage. How long do you give it?

697
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,542
Oh...

698
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:23,417
Is there doubt afoot?

699
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:27,042
I mean, I for one think
they look solid as a rock.

700
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:29,900
But there you go,
I'm just an old romantic.

701
00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:37,191
Yeah, yeah!

702
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:43,108
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

703
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:06,900
- Hello.
- Hey.

704
00:36:08,692 --> 00:36:11,751
I'm feeling... much better.

705
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:13,918
He's much improved.

706
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:15,084
Great.

707
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:17,167
Though you weren't actually invited.

708
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:19,751
Maybe I can get them to make you
an omelet and find you a chair.

709
00:36:19,775 --> 00:36:23,793
I think usually the ones who
are paying get a chair, no?

710
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:26,959
Oh. I didn't realize
you'd contributed, Marcia.

711
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,942
So rude of me. Thank you.

712
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,751
Let's get to the fuckin' room, shall we?

713
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,167
How is the big man? Well, well, well.

714
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:38,417
It's good to see you. You good?

715
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:41,084
All good. Everything is
good, acquisition-wise.

716
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:44,250
All we have to do is shut down the voice
of the fuckin' people over there.

717
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:46,483
Oh, there he is.

718
00:36:54,775 --> 00:36:57,149
- Will you excuse me?
- Absolutely.

719
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:10,817
Kendall.

720
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:13,775
Hey, Dad.

721
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,334
So, what about it, son?

722
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,334
You want to jump out of the
trenches and play a game of soccer?

723
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:24,209
Can I bring you some corn
to get you through the winter?

724
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:26,650
How ya doin'? What's the news?

725
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:29,400
Oh, keepin' busy.

726
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:36,626
You need a reference for your résumé?

727
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,417
Relatively punctual.

728
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:40,900
Prone to bouts of insubordination.

729
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:44,358
Yeah, well, you know.

730
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:49,084
So...

731
00:37:49,108 --> 00:37:52,709
how long are you gonna
fuck about on the outside?

732
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,167
Uh-huh. You recruiting?

733
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:59,400
What, new Head of Being
Continually Thwarted?

734
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,125
How would a TV network suit you? Huh?

735
00:38:08,149 --> 00:38:11,626
One of the big guys when I land it.

736
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,250
Could that work?

737
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:16,292
You feelin' the heat on your own?

738
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:17,584
Yeah? A little?

739
00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:20,042
You want me back? Like to...

740
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:22,066
Like to put that in a press release?

741
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,358
I'm just a lovely guy.

742
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:42,959
Can you top me up, please?

743
00:38:42,983 --> 00:38:46,459
So? What was all that about, cocksucker?

744
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:50,400
Oh, he was just telling me what
a sensational job you're doing.

745
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,775
Fuck you.

746
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:56,584
Did he mention the launch?

747
00:38:56,608 --> 00:38:59,056
Does he know that I've accelerated?

748
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:02,834
Say something fuckin' funny?

749
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:05,000
- Hello.
- Oh.

750
00:39:05,024 --> 00:39:06,751
Caroline Collingwood.
Mother of the bride.

751
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:08,167
Oh. Hi, I'm Stewy.

752
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:10,292
So, how long do you give it?

753
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:12,751
Uh, I'd say forever.

754
00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:16,542
Or until Shiv goes away for the
week, whichever comes first.

755
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:17,709
Excuse me.

756
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,959
You... beast.

757
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,167
Hi. Mom. I hear you're asking

758
00:39:22,191 --> 00:39:23,417
"how long you give it."

759
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:25,209
Just a cheeky icebreaker.

760
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,084
OK, well, it's pretty fuckin' horrible.

761
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:28,417
It's not all about you, Shiv.

762
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:30,417
Other people need something to say.

763
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:34,501
OK, well, can you ask them about
the price of fucking fish instead?

764
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:36,542
I like your girlfriend, Ro.

765
00:39:36,566 --> 00:39:39,250
Oh, thank you. I met her at a sex party

766
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,139
where she was giving the groom
a blowjob.

767
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:45,751
- You should marry that one.
- Excuse me?

768
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:47,959
And Shiv, stop taking
everything so seriously.

769
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:49,793
I'm trying to sparkle.

770
00:39:49,817 --> 00:39:52,959
When people ask me how long
I give it, I say forever.

771
00:39:52,983 --> 00:39:55,084
- OK, well...
- It will be forever.

772
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:57,316
- Well, thank you.
- Or it'll feel like forever.

773
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,042
She says she's being impish.

774
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,682
She's being a stone cold bitch.

775
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,250
Hey, you want to meet up
later tonight? All together?

776
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:09,983
- At the place?
- Yeah.

777
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:13,775
So, uh...

778
00:40:16,274 --> 00:40:17,709
you talked to the white whale?

779
00:40:17,733 --> 00:40:19,125
What'd he have to say?

780
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:20,668
Nothing. I mean,

781
00:40:20,692 --> 00:40:22,417
he's just shoring up his position.

782
00:40:22,441 --> 00:40:24,501
It's not real. He's under pressure.

783
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:27,167
Are you good? No wobbles, right? You OK?

784
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:31,501
I'm not gonna get coldcocked here, am I?

785
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:33,125
'Cause I heard from Frank

786
00:40:33,149 --> 00:40:35,392
the Canadians might
not be too keen on me.

787
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:37,167
You talked to
the fucking grandfather clock?

788
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:38,292
Has he signed anything?

789
00:40:38,316 --> 00:40:41,167
No, that would just be rude.

790
00:40:41,191 --> 00:40:43,250
I mean, he... he... he...

791
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,834
he used to give me flying lessons

792
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:46,209
in his fuckin' Cessna.

793
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:47,501
Come on, man.

794
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,417
You're not a little prince anymore.

795
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:52,167
Don't rely on Sir Talky
of Fuckchester, please.

796
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:53,598
He's good, Stewy.

797
00:40:57,566 --> 00:41:00,376
Are we working upstate, or...

798
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,834
Ah. Mr. Fuckhead, I presume.

799
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:07,834
Logan Roy, Logan Roy, Logan Roy.

800
00:41:07,858 --> 00:41:09,668
Are we allowed to talk?

801
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:13,709
I've nothing but admiration
for you personally, Mr. Roy.

802
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:15,125
Oh, really?

803
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:16,876
It's the sort of thing
you say, isn't it?

804
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,376
Ooh. Classy.

805
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,751
So, what is it you've got against me?

806
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,501
You're the one making it personal.

807
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,376
I'm just trying to do my job,

808
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,209
think of everyone, not just myself.

809
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:31,542
The interest of each is the good of all.

810
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:32,842
That is the whole of the law.

811
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,709
You don't need to remind me
of my Adam Smith.

812
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:37,459
- I taught economics.
- Where? Kindergarten?

813
00:41:37,483 --> 00:41:40,376
What about "From each
according to his ability",

814
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,876
to each according to his need"?

815
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,125
What about, and this isn't me talking,

816
00:41:44,149 --> 00:41:46,668
but what about me, Mr. Fucking Ability,

817
00:41:46,692 --> 00:41:48,084
busting my chops

818
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,334
in my auto shop

819
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,751
so that some needy fuck
from the projects

820
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:54,542
can jack off on my time?

821
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:56,084
That's the issue, I'm afraid.

822
00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:58,793
Well, I find that a very
reductive view of human nature.

823
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,417
I didn't make human nature,

824
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:02,751
but I do know what they read
and what they watch.

825
00:42:02,775 --> 00:42:06,584
I make my nut off
what people really want.

826
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,376
Don't tell me about people.

827
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,400
I'd go flat broke in a week if I didn't.

828
00:42:15,191 --> 00:42:17,108
Nice to meet you, Senator.

829
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,983
Yeah.

830
00:42:24,149 --> 00:42:26,334
Sleep well, Dad.

831
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:28,292
- Night.
- Thank you.

832
00:42:28,316 --> 00:42:31,459
Might be your last good one
for a decade or so.

833
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:32,793
Hmm?

834
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:35,793
The cruise situation.

835
00:42:35,817 --> 00:42:37,918
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

836
00:42:37,942 --> 00:42:39,125
Yeah, sure.

837
00:42:39,149 --> 00:42:40,959
Well, you might soon.

838
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:42,274
Unless...

839
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,834
You could afford to be
un peu plus agréable, Siobhan.

840
00:42:52,858 --> 00:42:54,709
You don't understand, Marcia.

841
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:59,459
Well, I know when I see a spoiled slut.

842
00:42:59,483 --> 00:43:00,709
Excuse me?

843
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:02,191
Tu m'entends.

844
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:05,459
What the fuck? Who are you?

845
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:07,834
Apart from a machine
for gathering power?

846
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:11,167
You don't know how vulnerable
a human being can be.

847
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:12,326
Oh, for fuck's sake.

848
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,042
Have you ever had a fucking
grapefruit without an agenda?

849
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:16,709
He made you a playground,

850
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:18,668
and you think it's a whole world.

851
00:43:18,692 --> 00:43:20,918
Well, va te faire foutre.

852
00:43:20,942 --> 00:43:23,501
Go out and see how you like it.

853
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:24,525
Fuck off.

854
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:34,501
Well, you two seem to be
the best of friends.

855
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:35,834
Don't.

856
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:38,834
Aw, come on. It's OK.

857
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:40,692
Hey. Pinky.

858
00:43:42,441 --> 00:43:44,233
Someone will be in touch.

859
00:43:47,066 --> 00:43:48,566
Great.

860
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,751
Mmwahh.

861
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:53,376
Hmm.

862
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,417
You know, you're fuckin' great.

863
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:58,250
Thank you!

864
00:43:58,274 --> 00:43:59,793
You're not a head fuck.

865
00:43:59,817 --> 00:44:02,035
Or a bitch or a leech.

866
00:44:03,066 --> 00:44:05,042
You say such pretty things.

867
00:44:05,066 --> 00:44:08,167
You never once asked to stay over...

868
00:44:08,191 --> 00:44:11,376
or how it works with my dad,
or the trust,

869
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,042
or what my stake is, you know?

870
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:18,108
I'm just pathologically incurious.

871
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:24,024
What if I was prepared to marry you?

872
00:44:25,942 --> 00:44:27,501
Hello?

873
00:44:27,525 --> 00:44:30,084
Hiya.

874
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:31,584
- Right.
- What?

875
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:33,626
Shiv's getting married,

876
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,376
Kendall got married...

877
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,167
I see. So, how about you
come down off of Mt. Olympus

878
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:40,042
and propose to a mere mortal?

879
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:41,584
Yeah, what if?

880
00:44:41,608 --> 00:44:43,918
- No.
- No?

881
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:46,250
- Crazy.
- Why is this crazy?

882
00:44:46,274 --> 00:44:50,042
Because this isn't
a normal relationship.

883
00:44:50,066 --> 00:44:51,250
Why?

884
00:44:51,274 --> 00:44:54,751
Well, um, for one thing,

885
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,751
we never fuck.

886
00:44:56,775 --> 00:44:58,501
Oh, yeah, we do.

887
00:44:58,525 --> 00:45:00,250
- No, we don't.
- Yeah, come on,

888
00:45:00,274 --> 00:45:02,292
yeah, we do,
we've been busy, that's all.

889
00:45:02,316 --> 00:45:06,584
No, you, like, kind of
jerked off near me, once.

890
00:45:06,608 --> 00:45:08,250
There's no need to be disgusting.

891
00:45:08,274 --> 00:45:10,959
To be honest, Roman,
I've had more sexual contact

892
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:12,876
with the groom than I have with you.

893
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,501
I asked you not to talk about that.

894
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:16,196
I've slept with a lot of guys,
Roman Roy,

895
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,209
and if that is gonna be a
problem, you better say.

896
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:20,376
It's not gonna be a problem, it's Tom's.

897
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,441
You want to get married or not?

898
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:28,084
Babe.

899
00:45:28,108 --> 00:45:31,817
Do you think this is the way
to get someone to stay?

900
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:40,751
Hey-hey, Gerri.

901
00:45:40,775 --> 00:45:43,209
Thank you for meeting me here.

902
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:44,376
Uh-huh. What is this?

903
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,292
Uh, just a chat.

904
00:45:46,316 --> 00:45:48,167
Right. It's your wedding;

905
00:45:48,191 --> 00:45:50,209
Why do I feel like
I'm about to get fucked?

906
00:45:50,233 --> 00:45:53,376
OK, it's late. Here's the situation.

907
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,834
I know all about the cruise
division horror show.

908
00:45:55,858 --> 00:45:57,834
And the cover-up.

909
00:45:57,858 --> 00:45:59,334
And Gil wants to go to town on you,

910
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:00,793
but maybe I can get him to hold off

911
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:03,042
if ATN stops the personal stuff.

912
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:04,084
Gil's wife.

913
00:46:04,108 --> 00:46:06,459
You want us to stop attacking him?

914
00:46:06,483 --> 00:46:08,584
Poor liddle fwagile
pwesidential candidate.

915
00:46:08,608 --> 00:46:11,668
No, keep attacking him
all through the primaries,

916
00:46:11,692 --> 00:46:13,668
fire up our base, and then just back off

917
00:46:13,692 --> 00:46:14,853
for the general.

918
00:46:14,877 --> 00:46:17,209
They're journalists, Shiv,
not remote-controlled little...

919
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,668
Yeah, sure they are. I just
feel confident that, you know,

920
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:23,167
a little public comment or two
from my dad, an email,

921
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:25,306
and the minions realign pretty quick.

922
00:46:27,024 --> 00:46:29,858
So you are, um...

923
00:46:29,983 --> 00:46:31,209
just to be clear...

924
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:32,668
Oh, yeah. No, I'm bullying you.

925
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:34,209
Yes. I'm blackmailing you.

926
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:35,923
I'm threatening to destroy my father,

927
00:46:35,947 --> 00:46:38,295
- however you want to put it.
- And you're happy with that?

928
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,876
Oh, come on, it is what it is.

929
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,000
You used to be such a nice girl.

930
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:46,125
- And Tom needs to be clean.
- Oh.

931
00:46:46,149 --> 00:46:49,459
Move him on, move him
up... maybe abroad.

932
00:46:49,483 --> 00:46:51,125
Clean hands.

933
00:46:51,149 --> 00:46:52,709
You're very pushy, missy.

934
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:55,024
Thank you, fairy godmother.

935
00:46:56,692 --> 00:46:59,125
And if I was authorized to accept,

936
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,918
can you get Mr. Smith
to fuck off back to Washington

937
00:47:01,942 --> 00:47:04,334
and not pull down his pants
to show off his amazing morals?

938
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:07,042
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can
persuade him that a dirty LBJ

939
00:47:07,066 --> 00:47:10,223
gets more done than a clean McGovern.

940
00:47:12,817 --> 00:47:14,918
OK, well, good night.

941
00:47:14,942 --> 00:47:16,918
Hey.

942
00:47:16,942 --> 00:47:21,084
No marriage advice
from my dear old godmother?

943
00:47:21,108 --> 00:47:25,000
I don't know. I was never
very good at all that.

944
00:47:25,024 --> 00:47:26,876
My husband died.

945
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,942
Don't let him die?

946
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:35,959
OK, what is this? I was in the
middle of a conversation.

947
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:38,834
Dude, I am super-sorry. Jess,
could you give us a second?

948
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:40,209
No. Stew? Seriously.

949
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,753
Ken, I got... I got Sandy on the line.

950
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:45,566
Sandy?

951
00:47:47,566 --> 00:47:49,043
- Fuck.
- What is it?

952
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:50,240
He can tell you.

953
00:47:50,264 --> 00:47:52,350
You can say, Stew.
What's with the theatrics?

954
00:47:52,374 --> 00:47:54,209
Can you hold for Mr. Furness?

955
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:55,876
He was just there. Where'd he go?

956
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,125
You're not gonna say? Seriously?

957
00:47:58,149 --> 00:48:00,084
Is this the coldcock?

958
00:48:00,108 --> 00:48:02,000
I think it's just best that he tell you.
That's all.

959
00:48:02,024 --> 00:48:03,834
You're such a pussy.

960
00:48:03,858 --> 00:48:07,125
Is... Is it... Is this,
uh, Canadian shit?

961
00:48:07,149 --> 00:48:10,626
Um... it's about that bear hug letter.

962
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:13,376
- Starting the takeover?
- OK.

963
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,793
An acceleration.

964
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:19,417
No, no, no. No, no, no. Fuck off.

965
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:21,292
This weekend.

966
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,459
- Hello, Sandy?
- At my sister's wedding?

967
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,626
Are you insane?
What do you want this to be,

968
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,501
One Wedding and Four Fuckin' Funerals?

969
00:48:28,525 --> 00:48:30,084
Hello?

970
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:32,084
Hi. Yeah, he told me already.

971
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:35,042
No, absolutely not,
no way, no. No! Fuck this!

972
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:39,042
Listen, but you
told Frank Vernon.

973
00:48:39,066 --> 00:48:41,250
I t... I...

974
00:48:41,274 --> 00:48:43,042
That has... I... I hinted.

975
00:48:43,066 --> 00:48:45,250
We've been contacted by a reporter,

976
00:48:45,274 --> 00:48:47,376
and they know something's cooking.

977
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,626
We have to go tomorrow or risk a leak,

978
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,525
which kills us.

979
00:48:53,692 --> 00:48:56,292
No. N... We're all together, OK?

980
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:58,584
This is... This is not a good time.

981
00:48:58,608 --> 00:49:00,793
Well, it really is a good time.

982
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:03,042
Your dad's out of the loop in the UK,

983
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:04,483
we catch him off-guard.

984
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:08,334
No.

985
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:13,834
I... I need to, uh, you know, pr...

986
00:49:13,858 --> 00:49:15,417
p-p-p-prepare.

987
00:49:15,441 --> 00:49:17,042
Uh, I... I...

988
00:49:17,066 --> 00:49:19,042
Sandy, I need...

989
00:49:19,066 --> 00:49:20,250
prep time.

990
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:22,042
OK? F-For the approach.

991
00:49:22,066 --> 00:49:25,709
You can't make an omelet
without breaking some dicks.

992
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:27,876
Look, I'm sorry. OK?

993
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,876
We'll be in touch with the letter,

994
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,125
and let's close-coordinate
on the minute it's presented.

995
00:49:33,149 --> 00:49:36,292
OK? Thanks, kid.

996
00:49:36,316 --> 00:49:39,441
Motherfucker.

997
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,584
- Hey. How ya doin'?
- Hey.

998
00:49:54,608 --> 00:49:57,542
Where's Con?

999
00:49:57,566 --> 00:49:59,042
- Uh...
- Did...?

1000
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:02,250
- Con? Was he invited?
- Did you tell him?

1001
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:05,000
- Oh... Come on. What?
- Oh.

1002
00:50:05,024 --> 00:50:06,959
You want me to get him? I told Willa.

1003
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:09,084
Uh... my...

1004
00:50:09,108 --> 00:50:10,793
Fucking hell!

1005
00:50:10,817 --> 00:50:12,608
Why did you get in the boat?

1006
00:50:15,608 --> 00:50:17,376
No, I'm good. I got shit to do.

1007
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,417
What?! Why are we here?

1008
00:50:19,441 --> 00:50:21,876
I thought this was for old times.

1009
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,959
- Uh...
- No?

1010
00:50:23,983 --> 00:50:26,334
What about you, you wanna smoke my jay?

1011
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:29,501
No, I got shit to do too.
A lot cookin'.

1012
00:50:29,525 --> 00:50:31,084
What the fuck! Really?

1013
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:33,000
All right, one hit.

1014
00:50:33,024 --> 00:50:34,973
There we go, motherfucker.

1015
00:50:37,108 --> 00:50:38,250
Diss.

1016
00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:40,608
- Intercepted.
- Old times.

1017
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,250
So listen, guys, um...

1018
00:50:46,274 --> 00:50:48,876
I do have something I need to tell you.

1019
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,042
Um... I was at Mom's earlier,

1020
00:50:52,066 --> 00:50:54,626
she had me going through
her papers and stuff,

1021
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,167
sortin' through some shit,

1022
00:50:56,191 --> 00:50:59,918
and it turns out, uh, Shiv...

1023
00:50:59,942 --> 00:51:02,250
you're adopted.

1024
00:51:02,274 --> 00:51:05,668
And Ken? You're adopted.

1025
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:07,709
And Connor is obviously adopted.

1026
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:10,292
And so all that shit's comin' to me,

1027
00:51:10,316 --> 00:51:11,751
so you can fuck off.

1028
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:14,501
I'm sorry, I don't know why
I asked you down here.

1029
00:51:14,525 --> 00:51:15,834
No, it's good.

1030
00:51:15,858 --> 00:51:18,149
Congratulations.

1031
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:20,983
I'm happy for you.

1032
00:51:22,566 --> 00:51:24,501
I'm happy for you.

1033
00:51:24,525 --> 00:51:25,733
Thanks.

1034
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:32,167
It's gotta not be so easy for you

1035
00:51:32,191 --> 00:51:35,191
to be on the outside,
seeing me do big shit.

1036
00:51:38,483 --> 00:51:39,584
Yeah.

1037
00:51:39,608 --> 00:51:41,692
Big of you. Thank you.

1038
00:51:43,274 --> 00:51:46,209
Yeah, well...

1039
00:51:46,233 --> 00:51:49,692
uh... can I suggest a hug?

1040
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,876
- You serious?
- What is it... What?

1041
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,125
- Yeah. I'm serious.
- Why?

1042
00:51:54,149 --> 00:51:56,042
Just... come on. Bring it in.

1043
00:51:56,066 --> 00:51:58,751
- You know you want to.
- I'm goin' butt-first.

1044
00:51:58,775 --> 00:52:01,459
Here I come.

1045
00:52:01,483 --> 00:52:03,723
- Here we all are!
- Ahh!

1046
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,723
Ow! I think I cut the nipple right off!

1047
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,709
I don't know, I mean, like,

1048
00:52:13,733 --> 00:52:15,167
I think I owe it to him,

1049
00:52:15,191 --> 00:52:17,501
but I don't want to be
the one to tell him.

1050
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:19,542
You know?

1051
00:52:19,566 --> 00:52:22,900
I mean, like, what if he
finds out that I knew?

1052
00:52:28,692 --> 00:52:31,376
Like... I either...

1053
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,042
I either owe it to tell him...
owe it to him to tell him,

1054
00:52:35,066 --> 00:52:39,584
or I don't owe it to him
to totally t... not tell him.

1055
00:52:39,608 --> 00:52:40,900
I think tell him.

1056
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:43,900
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1057
00:52:46,441 --> 00:52:48,167
Maybe don't?

1058
00:52:48,191 --> 00:52:49,900
I don't fuckin' know.

1059
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,084
Right.

1060
00:53:10,108 --> 00:53:12,709
Well, no we can't do that
because that'll trigger

1061
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:14,431
the disclosure...

1062
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,959
Oh, shit. That's him.
Wait. Stop. Stop.

1063
00:53:59,983 --> 00:54:01,793
Great night. Th-Thanks for the ride.

1064
00:54:01,817 --> 00:54:06,459
- Hey, Tom!
- Hey, hey!

1065
00:54:06,483 --> 00:54:10,024
- Hey, wait up!
- Morning, Greg!

1066
00:54:12,566 --> 00:54:14,501
Look, Tom, uh,

1067
00:54:14,525 --> 00:54:18,125
I... I, uh, didn't know...

1068
00:54:18,149 --> 00:54:20,334
like, exactly how to tell you this,

1069
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:24,668
and I've been up all night trying
to think exactly how to...

1070
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:26,149
broach...

1071
00:54:27,608 --> 00:54:29,834
So I want to just say that... that...

1072
00:54:29,858 --> 00:54:32,334
I think that Shiv is, like...

1073
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:33,584
No. N...

1074
00:54:33,608 --> 00:54:35,292
I think she's having an affair.

1075
00:54:35,316 --> 00:54:37,709
No. You're wrong.

1076
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,668
No... No, I'm... I mean, not...

1077
00:54:39,692 --> 00:54:41,417
Shut up, Greg. Shut up.

1078
00:54:41,441 --> 00:54:43,334
Well, no, because I s... I...

1079
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:45,834
- You are. You're wrong.
- Maybe I'm wrong.

1080
00:54:45,858 --> 00:54:47,793
You are wrong, so we're all good.

1081
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,876
- OK. G-Good.
- OK? So, good.

1082
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,250
Thank you for your time.

1083
00:54:51,274 --> 00:54:53,292
Yeah. And you don't want to hear...

1084
00:54:53,316 --> 00:54:55,542
I don't want to hear anything, Greg,
because it was a misunderstanding, OK?

1085
00:54:55,566 --> 00:54:57,011
- I saw what I saw...
- Shut up.

1086
00:54:57,035 --> 00:54:58,584
I just said shut up. Shut the fuck up.

1087
00:54:58,608 --> 00:54:59,876
All right,
but I think you should know...

1088
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,042
No. Shut... Shut the fuck up, Greg.

1089
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:04,292
- I'm trying to help you.
- Shut up, will ya?

1090
00:55:04,316 --> 00:55:06,125
- Fuckin' shut up.
- Dude! What the hell?!

1091
00:55:06,149 --> 00:55:08,584
I told you to fuckin' shut up!

1092
00:55:08,608 --> 00:55:10,918
Get off of me!

1093
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:12,834
- Just shut up!
- What the fuck, man?!

1094
00:55:12,858 --> 00:55:14,900
- Yeah, I...
- Shut up!

1095
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,209
You know,

1096
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:31,334
I was quite outraged
when she suggested this.

1097
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:34,709
I don't like being outside the U.S.
for too long.

1098
00:55:34,733 --> 00:55:36,084
Doesn't sit well.

1099
00:55:36,108 --> 00:55:39,292
And there's a mercilessness I miss.

1100
00:55:39,316 --> 00:55:41,334
I'm not used to
these squalid little deals.

1101
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:43,584
Yeah, living with the safety catch off,

1102
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:45,209
fuckin' without a rubber.

1103
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:47,417
Everywhere else feels so soft.

1104
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:49,942
I mean, look at this fuckin' place.

1105
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,292
Yeah, well, it...
it's all quite refined.

1106
00:55:54,316 --> 00:55:56,584
Refined? Ahh.

1107
00:55:56,608 --> 00:55:59,125
Slaves. Cotton and sugar.

1108
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:02,709
This country's nothing
but an off-shore laundry

1109
00:56:02,733 --> 00:56:06,223
for turning evil into hard currency.

1110
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,501
Is this where you tell me you're
working for the communists?

1111
00:56:10,525 --> 00:56:12,167
And now it just lies here,

1112
00:56:12,191 --> 00:56:14,417
living off its capital,
sucking in immigrants

1113
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:17,125
to turn it and stop it
getting bed sores.

1114
00:56:17,149 --> 00:56:19,459
I was looking forward
to taking you down.

1115
00:56:19,483 --> 00:56:21,483
You've got a very persuasive daughter.

1116
00:56:22,817 --> 00:56:26,626
But doesn't a deal feel so much better?

1117
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,274
Handshake?

1118
00:56:29,942 --> 00:56:32,983
I don't think either of us
want to get dirty, do we?

1119
00:56:53,483 --> 00:56:54,483
Yeah.

1120
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,834
You want to game it?

1121
00:57:11,858 --> 00:57:13,834
Sure.

1122
00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:15,584
Deliver the letter,

1123
00:57:15,608 --> 00:57:18,793
he calls emergency board...

1124
00:57:18,817 --> 00:57:22,066
we go public, world blows up.

1125
00:57:34,858 --> 00:57:37,209
The arbs dive in,

1126
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:39,876
he tells the world some fairy tales,

1127
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,793
talks poison pill, other defenses,

1128
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:45,723
board says, "Hang on,
we don't want to get sued."

1129
00:57:48,233 --> 00:57:49,942
Thank you.

1130
00:57:58,233 --> 00:58:00,334
Dad says, "Fuck the shareholders,"

1131
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:02,876
he calls analysts, calls hedge funds,

1132
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,501
tries to find a white knight,

1133
00:58:04,525 --> 00:58:06,250
calls us, tells us to fuck off.

1134
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,459
He's a good man, Pinky.

1135
00:58:09,483 --> 00:58:10,942
He's a good man.

1136
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,817
Price rockets, because everyone
knows we're gonna win.

1137
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:34,566
You think there's a
chance he'll just do a deal?

1138
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:38,608
Have you met my dad?

1139
00:58:40,775 --> 00:58:44,084
Nope. He'll never retreat.

1140
00:58:44,108 --> 00:58:47,650
It'll be hostile, hostile, hostile.
