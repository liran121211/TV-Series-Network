1
00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:02,794
There's a potential opportunity
for some acquisitions.

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:03,685
Local TV?

3
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:05,168
No one watches TV, Dad.

4
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:07,227
Why shouldn't we do all the news?

5
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:08,751
Well, Kim Jong-Pop,

6
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:10,958
because that's not how
things work in this country.

7
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:13,102
It's really happening!
We're getting married.

8
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:15,166
That is a very romantic
way of looking at a prenup.

9
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:17,478
He's actually acting kind of strange.

10
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:19,436
Like inviting me to Thanksgiving?

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,519
Dad?

12
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:21,894
He kept pouring, and
it just went everywhere.

13
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:23,644
It was like he didn't even see.
Dad! Hey! Whoa!

14
00:00:23,668 --> 00:00:25,603
All you have to do is do
a little bit of shredding.

15
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:27,935
Don't make it a big
deal. It's okay. It's a job.

16
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,769
Shooting bolts into cows'
heads is a job, but I... I...

17
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:32,585
It's not how I wanna spend my Thanksgiving.

18
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,377
You just invited me into the chicken coop.

19
00:00:35,918 --> 00:00:38,251
I'm gonna eat you all. One by fucking one.

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,144
I wondered if you could do me a favor.

21
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:41,935
Well, that might cause some ethical issues,

22
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:44,436
'cause there's a world
where my guy and your gal

23
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,793
ends up wrestling for the
Democratic nomination.

24
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,876
You lost, Grandpa.

25
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:51,019
Are you all right?

26
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:52,627
Take your hands off him, okay?

27
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:54,335
I've seen all I need to see.

28
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:57,668
So, are we doing this?
Don't ask me. He's your father.

29
00:00:58,168 --> 00:00:59,502
I'd be doing it for him.

30
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,436
This is fucking impressive.
You hooked this shit up, friend.

31
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,769
Hey, brother, I just wanna
say you killed that shit.

32
00:01:12,793 --> 00:01:15,102
My man. Absolutely killed that. For sure.

33
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:17,227
What's up, bro? Good to see you.

34
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,935
You're fuckin' imperial right now, OK?

35
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,353
I think American Diablo is your best album.

36
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:24,603
Thanks, guys. Much obliged.

37
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,769
All right, man. All right...

38
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:29,603
Are we supposed to follow him?

39
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:31,668
What's gonna happen?
Just be cool.

40
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,377
So, this guy's your boy, right?

41
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:38,894
Yeah. Hey, listen,

42
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:40,019
can I talk to you about something?

43
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:41,269
Mm-mm, sure.
Um...

44
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:43,019
Oh, here she comes. What's up?

45
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:45,102
So he's just decompressing, apparently,

46
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:46,935
but he's really down to connect.

47
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,561
Oh, he's decompressing?
What from his voyage

48
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:51,644
to the bottom of the fuckin' rap ocean?

49
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:53,685
His show was a shitty show.

50
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:56,186
But the label got a room for you guys.

51
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,852
Right here.
I'm sorry, what's your name?

52
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,144
Jess.
Jess. Sorry.

53
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:01,603
Can you just remind him

54
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:03,144
he's the guy that owns the company

55
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,810
that owns the company that owns the label

56
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,519
that pays his fucking ass?
Absolutely.

57
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,519
Yeah, just don't say those words.

58
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,168
Oh, my gosh, look at this.

59
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,852
Shrimp. Huh?

60
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:14,186
Look at this.

61
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,394
Warmed in this airless box for like,

62
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,102
what, let's say six hours?

63
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:21,186
And this goo? Is this
delicious fucking goo?

64
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,644
Look at that. Mmm!

65
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:25,102
So, listen, I need to say something,

66
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:26,810
but once I've said it I'll have said it,

67
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,894
and while it's not a
big deal, it's delicate.

68
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:31,227
What is it? You fucked the company?

69
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,353
I haven't fucked the company.

70
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:33,418
Uh-huh.

71
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:36,061
Scientology? What is it?

72
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:37,227
Look, we're friends,

73
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:38,977
we go back, I can trust you.

74
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,269
Right?

75
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,603
No.

76
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:45,061
Sure, but on money stuff, I can trust you?

77
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:46,644
No.

78
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:51,085
Because we're calling a vote
of no confidence on my dad.

79
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,894
What the fuck, man.

80
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:55,478
It's the best way forward right now.

81
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:57,436
This is fucking terrible.

82
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,810
Bro, you're gonna fuck the company.

83
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,436
You're fucking with my money, Ken.

84
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,644
Look, I'm telling you, it's just cleanest.

85
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:03,810
He's lost it.

86
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,894
He's going to D.C. tomorrow

87
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:07,644
to piss away our political capital

88
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:09,685
and position us
permanently in a dying sector.

89
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:11,436
Do you think you can win?
Of course.

90
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,311
It's finished. I'm informing
you, not courting you.

91
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:16,519
Because I have to work with whoever's left.

92
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:18,001
Right. With me.

93
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:22,353
So are we good?

94
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:24,269
Can I count on your vote for Team Future?

95
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:26,852
I can promise you that I am spiritually

96
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:29,102
and emotionally and ethically

97
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,001
and morally behind whoever wins.

98
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,311
What's the matter?

99
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:08,436
I'm pissed because I
have to come down to him

100
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,769
like a fuckin' FedEx guy.
Why can't he come to us?

101
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:13,519
Well, I guess he's the president.

102
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:16,561
Fuckin' Californian shrunken little raisin.

103
00:05:16,585 --> 00:05:18,227
I've seen ten of 'em.

104
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,436
He's basically a fuckin' intern.

105
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,186
Are you OK, Karl, on all this?

106
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,769
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

107
00:05:24,793 --> 00:05:26,061
On the law?
Yeah.

108
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:28,644
Gerri walked me through it too, so...

109
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:30,502
I wish she was here and not you.

110
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:34,561
Well, thank you.

111
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,644
She has to stay in the city
for board meeting prep, so...

112
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:39,793
It was a joke, Karl.

113
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:49,311
And I'm guessing if I
say cortado with almond,

114
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:51,415
you're gonna look like
I'm some kind of jerk, right?

115
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,918
I will have a black coffee,
please and thank you.

116
00:05:57,627 --> 00:05:59,102
Is this safe?

117
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,685
I don't think we're gonna
bump into anyone here.

118
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,436
So how'd it go with Stewy?

119
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,269
It went great. He's in.

120
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:07,793
OK. Well, that's great.

121
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,293
Yeah. So I think we're all good.

122
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:15,685
Uh-huh.

123
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,603
Shall I just... run it one more time

124
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,478
before we open our kimonos in public?

125
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:23,685
Logan.

126
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,102
Once the vote is proposed,

127
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:27,019
he's recused... out of the game.

128
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:31,144
So we have Kendall, Roman,
Frank. Three votes in favor.

129
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:32,685
And Asha. Your pet. That's good?

130
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,894
Rock solid. Already floated and noted.

131
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:35,852
Right.

132
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:38,561
Paul, Dewi, Datu...

133
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:41,269
They're old guard, they'll go Logan.

134
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:45,394
Yeah, well, sure. I mean... but sure.

135
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:47,603
OK, Uncle Ewan, uh,

136
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,977
he's still a possible, right?

137
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,769
Um, you could maybe
stoke the old resentments?

138
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:55,061
Lady Macbeth, gettin' your
little fuckin' screwdriver in.

139
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:57,561
It's not a fucking teddy
bear's picnic, Roman,

140
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,311
it's a massacre.
Lawrence?

141
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,478
Dad would sell Vaulter for parts.

142
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:03,436
Lawrence would be
crazy not to vote with me.

143
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,311
Except Lawrence hates you.

144
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:08,436
We have three for Logan,
five against, three unknowns.

145
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,727
Come on, this is bullshit.
Look, we push, Lawrence is ours,

146
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:13,810
Ewan could be ours, Ilona could be ours.

147
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,769
Gerri can't vote, but she can
talk for senior management.

148
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:20,061
This is done. There's being cautious,
and there's being fucking time-wasters.

149
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:22,685
If you want me to do this,
you gotta look worst case.

150
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,353
Lawrence, Ewan, Ilona, all in play.

151
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:27,186
One more makes us sure winners.

152
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,269
Yeah. We, uh... we hit Lawrence.

153
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:35,144
I got the call. The nuclear
reactor is sealed off.

154
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:38,561
The infected have been shot.
Oh, that's great.

155
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:41,269
That's great. Thank you.

156
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,353
Yeah.
Thank you so much.

157
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:45,394
We're good.
OK. OK.

158
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:46,644
Goodbye.
Bye.

159
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:49,227
Yeah. Goodbye forever.
Hope so.

160
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:50,727
Three men

161
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,769
to own half the wealth of America.

162
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:55,769
I have just been given the all-clear.

163
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:58,894
Ohh! I feel I can breathe again.

164
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,603
Honestly, honey, it's
like this 900-pound gorilla

165
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:04,935
has finally stopped fucking me.

166
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,935
Now, is this the thing I
don't want to know about?

167
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,769
Yeah. And it's gone.

168
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:12,144
Poof.

169
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:14,894
I think I'm good. I think I'm good.

170
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:16,603
Greg. Me. The circle's tight.

171
00:08:16,627 --> 00:08:19,977
He's good.
He's my little R2 unit.

172
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,852
I don't know.

173
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,519
Arrgh! I don't... This...
I don't fucking know!

174
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,727
Should I stick with her?

175
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:29,769
Is that a president?

176
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:31,793
Maybe. I don't know.

177
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,769
Now, not to be Groomzilla,

178
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:36,019
but can we talk about menus?

179
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:37,519
'Cause I really, really love Lake Como,

180
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:38,727
but I'm worried about the fog.

181
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,186
One thing is, people don't change.

182
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,769
You know, a candidate can't change.

183
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:45,061
You can primp and plump and repackage,

184
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:47,353
but if you want to change
someone fundamentally,

185
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:48,894
forget it.
So, should we go...

186
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:51,685
very old New York classy?

187
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:54,186
Oh. Yeah. Uh, I...

188
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,353
Sorry, I had a pretty shitty phone
call with my mom the other day,

189
00:08:58,377 --> 00:09:00,644
and just to smooth things
over I said that we might

190
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:03,769
have the wedding back in England.

191
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,102
You what?
Yeah.

192
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:09,019
Is that a biggie for you?
Excuse me, Shiv. Fuck.

193
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:11,436
Tom, it's just a wedding.
The planners will figure it out.

194
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,852
"Just a wedding"? Shiv.
Yeah.

195
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,810
It's our wedding!
Oh, Tom...

196
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:18,144
It only happens once.
I can't do this right now.

197
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:19,644
Tom.
OK. No...

198
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:20,977
I'm trying to think about work.

199
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,852
And I'm looking forward to it,

200
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:27,001
but I just can't get
into it all, all the details.

201
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:31,186
I mean, the wedding might
be in England, but it might not.

202
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,834
OK, OK, sorry, sorry.

203
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:36,311
So, I'll take Lawrence,

204
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,353
and you firm up the others,
yeah?

205
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,852
That's OK. I got him.

206
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:42,269
No, I know the guy.

207
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:44,144
I see him at every fucking fakers party,

208
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,102
phony soft opening that I go to.

209
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:49,727
We're like two peas in
a metrosexual think pod.

210
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:51,144
Look, are we doing this?

211
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:53,394
Are we running a fucking
company together, or what?

212
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:57,644
Just 'cause I like a joke
doesn't mean I'm a fucking clown.

213
00:09:57,668 --> 00:10:00,353
Look, Rome, I'm just trying to...

214
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:02,061
I got it.
I know you're not a clown.

215
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,394
I'm not.
It's delicate.

216
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:05,061
Oh, it's delicate? I didn't realize

217
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:06,852
it was delicate, the little nuances.

218
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:09,311
Lawrence fuckin' hates you, man, he does.

219
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:10,977
And he likes you?
Yeah.

220
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:12,353
He likes me. People like me.

221
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:15,019
I look like a matador and
everyone wants to fuck me.

222
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:17,227
I see him around. I know the guy.

223
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,727
Trust me.
OK.

224
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,186
Gerri says there are multiple indicators

225
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,519
he wants to be sympathetic
to our expansion.

226
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:25,561
You think so?

227
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:27,019
If he waves this through,

228
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,436
he gets hundreds of local TV stations

229
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,561
most amenable to talking about
what a great fuckin' guy he is.

230
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:35,436
He just needs to be prepared
to take a little political heat is all.

231
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,085
Four more years, we're
Proctor & Gamble of the news.

232
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:50,227
Hey. Tom. Uh, I'm heading to Washington.

233
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:53,727
Do you mind if I miss dinner? I
need to figure out about Joyce.

234
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,478
No, sweetheart, that's fine.

235
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:57,144
If you need to think about
your commitment to Joyce,

236
00:10:57,168 --> 00:10:59,227
then go, do it. Go to Washington.

237
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:01,436
Yeah, I just wondered if
I picked the right horse.

238
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,227
No, I get it, I do. Yeah.

239
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:05,478
Slide her under the X-ray machine, baby.

240
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:07,102
OK. Love you. Bye.
You, too. Bye.

241
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:08,727
Hey hey, guy.

242
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,311
Hey hey.

243
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,019
Hey. Everything OK, Greg?

244
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:13,793
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
Sure?

245
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:16,685
Good.

246
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,603
Good good.

247
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,311
You know, you can, uh,

248
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:23,293
you can talk to me about
anything. You know?

249
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,894
Oh, yeah. Well, I... Thanks.

250
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:32,335
Fantastic... resource.

251
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:36,751
OK, OK.

252
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:40,603
So, Shiv is going to Washington,

253
00:11:40,627 --> 00:11:45,668
so why don't, tonight,
why don't I take you out?

254
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,085
No?

255
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,685
What, for real?

256
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,603
I thought you were gonna say

257
00:11:56,627 --> 00:12:00,186
"take you out and
beat the shit out of you,"

258
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,478
or "take you out and put a bullet
through your dumb fuckin' brain,"

259
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:05,311
or something else, you
know, funny like that.

260
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:07,293
No, Greg, I'm not some beast.

261
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:13,144
Well, actually, I finally got paid...

262
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:15,394
Attaboy. OK.

263
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:17,311
It's like they're not
paying the light bill here,

264
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:19,727
but, um, but I actually got paid,

265
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:23,019
and I was thinking about
maybe going to, um,

266
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:26,019
have you ever visited
California Pizza Kitchen?

267
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:29,061
No. Dear Lord, no.

268
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:30,727
It's pretty delicious, Tom.

269
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,769
No. No, it isn't, Greg.

270
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,603
I mean, you might think
it tastes delicious, but...

271
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:37,727
They make a Cajun chicken
linguini just how I like it.

272
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,769
But that's not how
you're supposed to like it.

273
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:43,852
OK, you probably have
quite an undereducated palate.

274
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:47,478
So, let's go out, and I'll teach you.

275
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:50,876
And I'll show you how
to be rich. OK? It'll be fun.

276
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,935
He'll be just along the
hallway here, Mr. Roy.

277
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,977
I have been here before,

278
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:00,852
and I do know how hallways work.

279
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,502
Someone will be with you shortly.

280
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:12,102
What a fuckin' song and dance, eh?

281
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,353
Ah.
Mr. Roy. I am so sorry,

282
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,685
but the president passes
on his sincere apologies.

283
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:19,311
He's currently dealing with a
matter of homeland security.

284
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:21,685
He's sure you'll understand,
but he's going to need to offer

285
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:24,061
an alternative face for this discussion.

286
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:27,478
"Alternative face," what
the fuck does that mean?

287
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:30,519
If I drop my pants, I can
show you an alternative face.

288
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,561
How does that sound?

289
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:34,227
Have I been snubbed?

290
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:36,061
Find out if I've been snubbed.

291
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:38,019
I don't think you've been snubbed.

292
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:41,311
Is this a snubbing?! Just fucking find out!

293
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:43,935
Holy shit. Wamsgans!

294
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,019
A fuckin' black eye?

295
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,227
You should see the other guy.

296
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:50,851
The guy who jammed his dick in your eye?

297
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:53,394
Let's just say, uh,

298
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:55,769
I was in bed, with Shiv, so...

299
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,394
What? She punched you?

300
00:13:57,418 --> 00:13:59,061
No.

301
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,685
Things just get a little hot and heavy.

302
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:03,269
A little freaky-deaky. So...

303
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:06,102
Fuckin' our sister? That's cool, man.

304
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:08,644
Yeah, it's kinda weird
when you talk about that.

305
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,603
No, I think it's really cool.

306
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:13,769
Like, what's it like,
like, to bang our sister?

307
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:15,353
So what's goin' on? Clue me in.

308
00:14:15,377 --> 00:14:17,394
Uh, we just finished, bud.

309
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:20,478
Yup. Yeah, I'm gonna go, uh,

310
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:23,019
eat a fucking elk or something.

311
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:24,269
See ya later.

312
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:26,460
Oh, hey, Tom.

313
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:29,935
Just to say I know

314
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,603
you've been eating a lot of shit for me

315
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:33,394
that I don't know about,

316
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:35,436
and I appreciate that.

317
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,727
I like you.

318
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,519
You're Team Kendall, man.

319
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:42,269
Lot of stuff goin' down,

320
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:44,144
but you're on the team.

321
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:46,502
Thanks, brother.

322
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:50,353
Here's to us.

323
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:51,627
To us.

324
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:56,727
Uh, so I do need to ask something,

325
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,311
but, um...

326
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:00,227
we're cool, yeah?

327
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:02,769
Like, we're fuckin' disruptors, Yeah?

328
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:03,834
Yeah.

329
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:08,311
But, um...

330
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:10,810
what would you say...

331
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:12,685
what would you say if I told you

332
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,311
that there was gonna be a
vote of no confidence tomorrow?

333
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:19,061
Kick out the old man,
in with the new guard.

334
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,644
Romey and the homey.

335
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:23,269
You and Kendall are
thinking of killing your dad?

336
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:25,311
Well...
That's a little Greek tragedy.

337
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:26,644
Yeah, Oedipus.

338
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:28,685
Did I say that I was going to fuck Marcia?

339
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:32,353
No. Although I definitely
would, 'cause she's hot.

340
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,377
But that's, you know,
that's like phase two.

341
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,668
Hey.
Hey.

342
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:49,186
I'm sorry I'm late.

343
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,186
Yeah, no. No worries.

344
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,810
This place has changed.

345
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:57,061
Uh... yeah.

346
00:15:57,085 --> 00:16:00,810
I mean, well, e-everything changes.

347
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,769
We've changed.

348
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:06,644
What's this? Shiv Roy goes soulful.

349
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:08,561
Does not suit you.

350
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:12,561
It's like you're wearing a
turtleneck and a stick-on mustache.

351
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:15,269
All right, yeah.

352
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:17,377
Well, I do have feelings.

353
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:23,727
So, uh, congratulations on Senator Miller.

354
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,186
Thank you.

355
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,227
Not exactly the fuckin' Southern Strategy,

356
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:29,603
gettin' a bunch of Jews, blacks,
and media studies professors

357
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:31,644
to vote in a Democrat in
New York state, but still...

358
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:33,478
Fuck you. You've seen the numbers.

359
00:16:33,502 --> 00:16:36,186
Yeah, there's a number of
ways of analyzing the numbers.

360
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,227
I did a fucking good job,
in the teeth of a scandal.

361
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:42,977
At this point in the cycle, I
knocked it out of the fucking park.

362
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,585
So here's to me.

363
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:50,769
How's everything in the
People's Republic of Gil Eavis?

364
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:51,793
Amazing.

365
00:16:53,502 --> 00:16:58,019
So, go on, Shiv, what is this?

366
00:16:58,043 --> 00:17:01,852
OK, uh, well...

367
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:04,810
I want you to think about joining us.

368
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,394
Me and Joyce.
Why?

369
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:10,269
Because I need a piece of shit on the team.

370
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:12,769
What do you think?

371
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:16,394
Is it a good idea? You and me?

372
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:19,144
Uh, yeah. Why?
Historically speaking,

373
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:23,126
we found it quite hard
not to fuck each other.

374
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:29,894
It's great to see you...
on such short notice.

375
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:31,019
Shush. Eat.

376
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:34,810
I finished most of 'em, Grandpa.

377
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:37,311
Your mother says you don't have any money.

378
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:40,311
Until recently, but actually, um,

379
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:41,852
my pay came through.

380
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:44,561
And now I'm incredibly rich.

381
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:46,810
Really?
Mm-hmm.

382
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:50,852
Well, uh, I'm sure you're
going to be very happy.

383
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:52,311
Thank you.

384
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:54,478
She also told me to feed you,

385
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,644
so eat up.

386
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:58,644
Whew. Honestly,

387
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:00,353
I think my stomach might have shrunk

388
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:04,644
during my... my period of poverty.

389
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:08,311
The waste in this city is obscene.

390
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:09,668
Finish it.

391
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,561
So, how come you're here... You're in town,

392
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:17,102
uh, if I may ask?

393
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:20,353
Well...

394
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:23,251
you're a grownup, allegedly.

395
00:18:24,543 --> 00:18:27,935
So here's what grownups do.

396
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:31,561
Kendall is gonna call for
a vote of no confidence

397
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:35,144
against his own father
at the next board meeting.

398
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:37,685
S-Sounds like a huge deal,

399
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,561
but it's just procedure or...

400
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:44,685
It's a wanton act of egregious selfishness.

401
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:47,353
In keeping with everything
else I've come to loathe

402
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:50,685
about this rat's nest of a family.

403
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,269
Right. Right.

404
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:54,644
So are you gonna tell Logan?

405
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,727
I'm gonna keep my snout of the trough,

406
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,144
thank you very much.

407
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:03,977
Paddle your own canoe.

408
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:06,126
Hmm?

409
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:19,102
Hello?

410
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:20,769
Kendall?

411
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,061
Marcia.

412
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:24,561
I was wondering, if you're not busy,

413
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:27,251
if you don't mind joining
your father for dinner?

414
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,144
Did he ask to have dinner with me?

415
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:33,227
Yeah.

416
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:34,894
He's home alone,

417
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:36,935
and I have something I cannot miss.

418
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:41,269
Um... just him and me?

419
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:44,394
Yeah. Is it a bad time?

420
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:46,603
Do you have something planned?

421
00:19:46,627 --> 00:19:48,935
Uh, no. Of course.

422
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,603
Um, no, I'm... I'm around.

423
00:19:51,627 --> 00:19:52,644
Thank you.

424
00:19:52,668 --> 00:19:54,603
I've left some steamed fish.

425
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,251
Merci beaucoup.

426
00:19:57,502 --> 00:19:58,627
OK, su...

427
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:04,603
Mmm.
Exactly.

428
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:08,186
When I had their monkfish, I thought I
was gonna shit, puke and cum all at once.

429
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,977
That sounds... delicious.

430
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,603
Although I don't actually
have much of an appetite.

431
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:16,769
Well, you better find one quick,

432
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:19,269
'cause this is one of the most
exclusive popups in the city,

433
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,894
and we're having the full tasting menu.

434
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:23,460
Uh-huh.

435
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:29,227
How come the... the wine
list doesn't have any prices?

436
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,102
Because they're obscene.

437
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:35,144
Look, here's the thing
about being rich, OK?

438
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,311
It's fucking great.

439
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:40,685
OK? It's like being a
superhero, only better.

440
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:43,436
You get to do what you want, the
authorities can't really touch you,

441
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,311
you get to wear a costume,
but it's designed by Armani,

442
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:49,311
and it doesn't make you look like a prick.

443
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:50,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

444
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,168
Thank you.
Thank you.

445
00:20:55,168 --> 00:21:00,543
If I was going to come in
with you, what's your vision?

446
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:01,852
Well, it's me and Kendall.

447
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:04,227
Fuck Kendall. OK?

448
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:06,543
You. What's your vision?

449
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:11,102
You know what?

450
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:14,353
I ended up in a book shop the other day,

451
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:15,935
and I just started laughing.

452
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,685
OK.

453
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,644
I was looking at all the books
cramming up all the walls,

454
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:23,436
and I just thought, you
know, about the olden days,

455
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,852
all the fucking monasteries and the Bibles

456
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:29,227
and the sermons and the "Did Jesus
say this? And "Do you mean that?"

457
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:30,644
and all the words and what have you.

458
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:31,561
All gone.

459
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:33,102
No one gives a fuck.

460
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,311
You're saying we're going post-literate.

461
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,603
People are gonna read,

462
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,977
but the old world, it's gone.

463
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,144
Papers, gone. News, gone.

464
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:43,727
"Tune in to ABS at nine
to be told what to think."

465
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,227
No. Over.

466
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:47,561
It's all about the morsels, man.

467
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:50,227
Feed me the fucking tasty morsels.

468
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:52,644
Keep me interested. That
is where we're headed.

469
00:21:52,668 --> 00:21:55,186
Tasty morsels from groovy hubs.

470
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,709
Tasty morsels... from groovy hubs.

471
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,519
Um, look, man,

472
00:22:02,543 --> 00:22:04,644
I'm dumb, but I'm smart.

473
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:08,061
I'm too dumb to know how to fix our whole
company. I don't have the attention span.

474
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:09,810
This is probably the most interesting thing

475
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,353
that's happened in my whole life,

476
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:13,144
and I'm thinking about six other things.

477
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:15,727
But I am smart enough to
know what needs changing,

478
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,561
and I'm smart enough to spot the people

479
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:20,585
who can help us, Lawrence.

480
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:23,585
So are you in?

481
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,834
Well...

482
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,810
I'm on the side of change.

483
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:34,543
Yeah, you are.

484
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,769
Sorry... Oh, fuck.

485
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:39,269
Mind if I take this?

486
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:40,478
Go ahead.

487
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:42,478
Sorry, fellas. Keep it sexy.

488
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:43,769
Yeah?

489
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:46,769
Marcia asked me to have dinner with Dad.

490
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:49,061
He knows. Does he know? I don't know.

491
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:51,269
Did he mention me?

492
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:53,102
What did Lawrence say?

493
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:54,810
Uh, he's in.

494
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,353
For real?

495
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:57,685
Yes, for real. Fuck you.

496
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,519
Nice. OK.

497
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:01,685
OK, great. Thanks.

498
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:03,311
Oh, Jesus.

499
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:04,769
What... What now?

500
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:07,019
Ortolan.
What's ortolan?

501
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:09,810
It is a deep-fried
songbird. You eat it whole.

502
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:12,311
Oh, my God...
This is a rare privilege.

503
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:14,102
And it's also kind of illegal.

504
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,311
Oh, I have a...
For the head.

505
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:17,186
The exact purpose is debated.

506
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,311
Some say it's to mask the shame;

507
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:21,460
Others, to heighten the pleasure.

508
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:34,061
Oh, my God.

509
00:23:34,085 --> 00:23:36,227
That is so good.

510
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:38,769
Did you eat it yet, Greg?

511
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,251
Not yet, no.
Eat it, Greg!

512
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:49,644
Um, it's a rather... unique flavor.

513
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:54,210
Yeah, it's the gamy, brainy hit, my friend.

514
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:56,335
Oh.

515
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:00,685
Can we have some more wine, please?

516
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,644
You trying to seduce me, Tom?

517
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:05,043
Yes, I am! Yes, I am, Greg.

518
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,478
All the things we've seen,

519
00:24:08,502 --> 00:24:09,852
all the things we've done...

520
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:11,186
We're in this together, man.

521
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,269
OK. Is that...

522
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:17,585
Is that what this is,
this is about the thing?

523
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:19,852
We have a bond.

524
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,102
You do?
Yeah, sure.

525
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:24,144
I was an outsider once.

526
00:24:24,168 --> 00:24:27,561
Young guy from St. Paul, alone
in the big city, and it was hard.

527
00:24:27,585 --> 00:24:30,394
And you create this
kind of protective shell,

528
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:34,751
but underneath, we're
all just little... nudie turtles.

529
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:37,894
OK.

530
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:39,603
I gotta level with you,

531
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:43,561
because if I eat any more
songbirds, I'm gonna hurl.

532
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:46,644
My grandpa already
bought me dinner tonight.

533
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:48,769
Your grandpa? What's he doing in New York?

534
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:54,186
He's come down for this vote of
no confidence in Logan tomorrow.

535
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,519
Did you know about that?

536
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:57,935
What? You serious?

537
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:01,186
Yeah, he's come down especially to vote.

538
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,102
It's a big deal, right?

539
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,751
Yeah. Hold on. Hold on.

540
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:10,561
You say you want me...
but really, you don't.

541
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:12,894
It's so exciting when you
know more about me than I do.

542
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:15,894
You want me for my edge,
'cause she's not edgy enough.

543
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:18,519
You should be workin'
for a winner like Gil.

544
00:25:18,543 --> 00:25:22,061
You know I'm a considerably more successful
political strategist than you are.

545
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,977
Shiv, you work with what you got,

546
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,935
and what you got is... bleachh.

547
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,436
I've been grooming Joyce for three years.

548
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,269
Appeals to everyone.
Exactly.

549
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:33,644
Which is a little like
appealing to no one. She's nice.

550
00:25:33,668 --> 00:25:35,769
That is a horrible thing
to say about anyone.

551
00:25:35,793 --> 00:25:40,769
Look, Kendall told me
how you're marrying this...

552
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:46,353
guy, this corn-fed basic from hockey town.

553
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,269
Yeah, Tom. He's a great guy.
Sure.

554
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:50,436
Great guy with the square head.

555
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,102
And you're workin' for the nice black lady.

556
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:55,102
What are you trying to prove?
You're such a fucking prick.

557
00:25:55,126 --> 00:25:57,311
You should be with an
exciting bastard like me.

558
00:25:57,335 --> 00:26:00,335
I tried playing with you, and you broke.

559
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:15,353
Sir. Your father's on a call in the den.

560
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:18,353
He asked if you'd wait a moment.

561
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,834
Oh, sure.

562
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:39,685
Tom? Uh, hey, can this wait till tomorrow?

563
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:41,852
You're gonna want to
hear this. Ewan is in town,

564
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:43,852
and he knows, and he's come to vote.

565
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:46,168
What? Hold... Hold on.

566
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:48,935
Who's your source?

567
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:52,353
Uh, I can't reveal my sources.

568
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,959
But it's Greg.

569
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:57,603
OK. Uh, Tom,

570
00:26:57,627 --> 00:27:00,102
you do not breathe a word of this, OK?

571
00:27:00,126 --> 00:27:01,436
My lips are sealed.

572
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,353
All right. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate it.

573
00:27:04,377 --> 00:27:06,335
It's not a big deal. Team Kendall.

574
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:13,144
My God. My God! It's actually happening.

575
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:14,561
It's happening.

576
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:17,394
The troops are taking Saddam's palace, man.

577
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,353
This time tomorrow, you and me...

578
00:27:19,377 --> 00:27:21,894
I could... I could be like the...

579
00:27:21,918 --> 00:27:25,977
I could be like the third most
important guy in the company.

580
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:28,918
I mean, it's the storming of the Bastille.

581
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:31,751
Let us eat cake. I mean...

582
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:36,418
I don't know what we're talking about.

583
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:57,751
Thanks, Richard.

584
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:10,585
Hey, Dad.

585
00:28:11,668 --> 00:28:12,834
Hey.

586
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,227
You shouldn't eat this shit.

587
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:23,168
You're not the boss of me.

588
00:28:39,293 --> 00:28:44,144
Did you want to talk? Marcia
said you... wanted to see me.

589
00:28:44,168 --> 00:28:45,168
Marcia.

590
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:49,460
Yeah, she's got her own game goin' on.

591
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:53,603
What does that mean?

592
00:28:53,627 --> 00:28:55,644
You know what it means.

593
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:58,001
You've got your game goin' on.

594
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:02,335
I've got my game.

595
00:29:04,668 --> 00:29:08,353
What... What's, uh, what's your game?

596
00:29:08,377 --> 00:29:11,168
Everybody's got a game.

597
00:29:16,043 --> 00:29:18,227
So what's goin' on?

598
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:20,519
What's the action? What's the story?

599
00:29:20,543 --> 00:29:22,685
What's goin' on?

600
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:25,269
You heard about my meet?

601
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:28,186
You heard it was a snub?

602
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,502
What? Uh... Oh.

603
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:36,918
Yeah, I heard, um...

604
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:41,519
Uh, I heard real security alert,

605
00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:44,085
but who knows, it's tough to read.

606
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,585
Oh, fuck.

607
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:55,043
I could do something about this.

608
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:58,876
OK?

609
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:04,935
Haven't had one of these in, uh...

610
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:07,269
I don't even know.

611
00:30:07,293 --> 00:30:08,685
You gonna eat it?

612
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:10,061
Yeah, I'm gonna eat it.

613
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:12,418
Hey, good.

614
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,793
Cheers.
Cheers.

615
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:19,585
Oh, fuck!

616
00:30:20,918 --> 00:30:22,834
Every fuckin' time!

617
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:34,353
Thanks, man. Thanks.

618
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:37,186
Should I get us some beers?

619
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,935
No, no. No need. Bottle
service. I ordered vodka.

620
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:40,894
Come on.

621
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:43,769
Whoa! Go ahead, man.

622
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:45,603
Hey! So this is what you do?

623
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:48,519
You, like, go to a club,
and then you come to, like,

624
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:50,519
this other part where
the club sort of isn't?

625
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:52,353
Yeah! Yeah, that's it!

626
00:30:52,377 --> 00:30:54,852
This is 2,000 bucks a pop.

627
00:30:54,876 --> 00:30:56,269
Why?

628
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:58,436
No reason! We're being totally ripped off!

629
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,102
Is this gold... Is this gold leaf?

630
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,478
Uh-huh. Drink the gold, my friend.

631
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:07,502
And then later you and I
can have a 24-karat piss.

632
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,935
Any news?

633
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,019
Um, we have Lawrence.

634
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:27,019
That'll make our sleep easier.

635
00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:28,935
If I can sleep. Which I won't.

636
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:30,852
I think I'm just gonna call Sarita

637
00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:32,810
and check Ilona's out of the action.

638
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:34,935
Oh, do we need?

639
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,935
You're not worried that could stir things?

640
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,353
Just to cover all the bases.

641
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:40,977
Hey, Frank?

642
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:44,210
Listen, is... is this...

643
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,644
Is this, like, objectively... horrible?

644
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:53,519
You know, w-we could hold off.

645
00:31:53,543 --> 00:31:55,353
We could put this together next quarter...

646
00:31:55,377 --> 00:31:58,353
Ken. You made this happen.

647
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:02,061
It's hard enough to get five
people together for a fuckin' dinner.

648
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,311
You might never get another shot.

649
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:07,810
And it's the right thing to do.

650
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,685
Strength.

651
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:11,709
You're a good son.

652
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:14,186
Night, Ken.

653
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,709
Goodnight.

654
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:25,727
Hello?
Sarita, hey.

655
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:28,478
Sorry to call so late. I...

656
00:32:28,502 --> 00:32:32,269
You know, I was just,
uh, thinking, and... and...

657
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:33,810
It's nice to hear your voice.

658
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:35,685
Yeah, it's nice to hear your voice.

659
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:37,727
I don't know, I felt bad,

660
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,603
and I wanted to check in... on your mom.

661
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:43,186
Uh, I assume she can't make it

662
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,001
to the board meeting tomorrow, sadly.

663
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:51,876
No. I have to go, Kendall.

664
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,603
So, tell me more about Mr. Potato Head.

665
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,227
Tom?

666
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:21,019
He's a... He's amazing.

667
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,561
Well, I'm pleased.

668
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,478
Uh, but... It is great.
Shiv.

669
00:33:26,502 --> 00:33:28,269
You're convincing me. You are.

670
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:31,935
It's the constant sort
of... weary repetition.

671
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:34,751
"Tom's great."
He is.

672
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:41,751
We're not gonna fuck tonight, right?

673
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:45,436
You know I'm getting married, too.

674
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,269
Oh, really.

675
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:49,769
Car model or failed actress?

676
00:33:49,793 --> 00:33:51,603
Ouch. There she is.

677
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:53,810
She's actually a French doctor.

678
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,769
That's nice.

679
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:59,852
I mean, it doesn't mean
we can't do other stuff.

680
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:02,102
Uh...
Theoretically.

681
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:04,727
I'm getting married in March.

682
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,269
I'm getting married in May.

683
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:09,019
It's not a competition.
Sure. Yeah.

684
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:11,935
But only one of us is getting
married in lilac season,

685
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,977
and it's not you.

686
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:16,935
Come on.
What?

687
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:20,227
I have to say I am feeling...

688
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:23,061
You're feeling what, Nate?

689
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:25,769
I mean, we could
masturbate in separate rooms.

690
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:27,311
Oh, God!
No. It's quite modern.

691
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:29,144
No. Come on!
Or... Or...

692
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:32,144
Just, for old times' sake, last one.

693
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:33,478
Absolute last one.

694
00:34:33,502 --> 00:34:36,852
I could just, you know,
the old traditional...

695
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:39,478
simply... stick it in.

696
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:42,977
Yeah. Like a gas station, right?

697
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:45,061
Just stick it in.

698
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:46,852
So a French doctor, huh?

699
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,603
She sounds far too nice
and interesting for you.

700
00:34:49,627 --> 00:34:51,810
She's not that nice.

701
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:56,502
Deep down she's... statusand
money-obsessed. Like you.

702
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:00,478
This is nice.

703
00:35:00,502 --> 00:35:02,977
This is like being friends.

704
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,460
You know.

705
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:13,977
It was Gil.

706
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:15,709
He's very interested.

707
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:18,918
I think you should do this.

708
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:25,186
You're hot, you're...

709
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,935
so hot right now.

710
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,210
Come on. Nate.

711
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:32,543
We should be good people.

712
00:35:33,876 --> 00:35:35,561
Uh, I know.

713
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:39,585
Wouldn't it be nice to just
wake up in the morning and...

714
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:45,418
not feel like a fucking piece of shit?

715
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:05,085
Hey, Shiv.
Morning.

716
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:11,269
You know you're amazing, right?

717
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:13,210
Uh, yeah. I guess.

718
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:19,519
Come meet Gil.

719
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:22,959
He's not a pipe dream.
He's gonna go all the way.

720
00:36:24,668 --> 00:36:25,935
OK.

721
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:28,561
So, we behaved ourselves.

722
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:31,269
They're gonna write songs
about how good we were.

723
00:36:31,293 --> 00:36:34,019
Shiv? You're a blonde beast.

724
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:37,436
You should do whatever you want.

725
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,834
Bye, Nate.

726
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:44,102
I think it's gonna be tight, but, uh...

727
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:45,810
you know, all the variables swing our way.

728
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:46,834
Huh.

729
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:51,126
Whup.

730
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,977
Hey, what's up, Jess?

731
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:58,668
I have Ms. Shinoya on the line.

732
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,502
OK.

733
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:05,561
Sarita?

734
00:37:05,585 --> 00:37:08,102
Hello?

735
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,144
Ilona. Ilona, hi. How are you?

736
00:37:11,168 --> 00:37:13,519
God, it's great to hear your voice.

737
00:37:13,543 --> 00:37:17,894
Y-You're up. Um, did...
did you get my gift?

738
00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:22,519
Yes. So, my daughter told
me you don't want me voting

739
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:24,311
in today's board meeting. Is that right?

740
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:26,603
No, no, no. That's... That's not it at all.

741
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:28,644
That's, um...

742
00:37:28,668 --> 00:37:31,353
C-Can I explain? That's...

743
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:32,644
Well, I'm letting you know

744
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,311
that I will be dialing in.

745
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:38,061
O-OK. Well, look, there's some issues.

746
00:37:38,085 --> 00:37:41,019
I know you haven't...

747
00:37:41,043 --> 00:37:43,519
Look, could I... Could I
come and talk it through?

748
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:46,519
Kendall, I will be dialing in.

749
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:47,852
I'll be there in an hour.

750
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:50,418
Great. OK, thanks, Ilona.

751
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:56,144
You're gonna go all the way
out to her? To Long Island?

752
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:58,519
Yeah, I can...
Is there time?

753
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,019
I can make it. I can make it.

754
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:01,685
I think...

755
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:03,251
I think I have to go.

756
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,769
Hey. You ready? Let's go.

757
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:33,727
Sorry, Mr. Roy, the skies are closed.

758
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:35,977
Temporary flight restriction.
There's a possible terror threat.

759
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:39,102
No, no, I need to go, pal. I'll pay
whatever fine they hit us with. Let's go.

760
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,751
We can't do that, sir.
FAA will pull my license.

761
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:48,061
Uh, OK, I'll handle the FAA.

762
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,436
Or... What is it? The AHS? I'll handle it.

763
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,810
Whatever you lose financially,
I'll make up in perpetuity. OK?

764
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:56,876
Sir, if we take off now, we
can be shot down by an F-16.

765
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:01,144
Yeah, but not really. Right?

766
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:02,769
Airspace is on lockdown.

767
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:04,709
There's nothing we can do.

768
00:40:09,627 --> 00:40:10,834
Whoa whoa!

769
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,043
Yo!

770
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:19,043
How long to get to the
city? Financial district?

771
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:25,478
Man, we should get a round
of fuckin' shots going, right?

772
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:27,061
Make it happen.

773
00:40:27,085 --> 00:40:29,186
Will do.

774
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,353
It's nice to see the war
criminal. Cleans up well.

775
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:34,102
Yeah, nice guy, lovely guy.

776
00:40:34,126 --> 00:40:35,894
Whoo.

777
00:40:35,918 --> 00:40:38,543
We good, then? Solid? Right?

778
00:40:41,043 --> 00:40:43,061
I heard Logan started on time even when

779
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:46,436
he was airlifted in from
Aspen with a shattered femur.

780
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,685
That is true.

781
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:50,019
Yep, no.

782
00:40:50,043 --> 00:40:51,543
That is correct.

783
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:55,894
Hey, is your phone working?

784
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:57,727
C-C-Can I get like a motorcycle courier?

785
00:40:57,751 --> 00:40:59,727
Anything? Can you call your office?

786
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,102
Sorry, no bars.

787
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,685
They're evacuating five blocks

788
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:05,227
each way from the Stock Exchange.

789
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:08,227
Lower Manhattan.
NYPD has shut down

790
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:10,977
the West Side Highway...
Gerri. Can you hear me?

791
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,186
Hey, where are you?

792
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,227
Hey, listen, I'm... I'm...

793
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:14,644
I'm almost there.

794
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:16,311
The traffic's stopped. I need you to stall.

795
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:17,394
What? What's that?

796
00:41:17,418 --> 00:41:18,519
It's a bad connection.

797
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:19,644
I can't really hear you.

798
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:21,436
Gerri?

799
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,311
I'm in a tunnel.

800
00:41:23,335 --> 00:41:24,561
OK? Stall.

801
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,478
Well, how far are y...

802
00:41:26,502 --> 00:41:28,061
Uh, I...

803
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,894
Shit.

804
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:31,894
What?

805
00:41:31,918 --> 00:41:33,227
He's in traffic.

806
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:34,727
Don't. Don't do this.

807
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,894
He's asking us how long can we stall.

808
00:41:36,918 --> 00:41:40,210
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Great.

809
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,852
Oh.

810
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:47,793
It'll be all right. He's
not gonna be too late.

811
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:56,810
Here he comes.
Morning, morning.

812
00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:58,144
Good morning.

813
00:41:58,168 --> 00:42:00,102
Oh! Quite a turnout.
Yeah.

814
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:02,394
Frank, will you whip us through?

815
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:08,311
Uh, I... I just got word. I think
Kendall will be a few minutes late.

816
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:10,269
Request for a late start?

817
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:11,769
No!
No?

818
00:42:11,793 --> 00:42:13,935
He can catch up. Fuck that! Where is he?

819
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:17,186
Stuck in traffic. That's all I know.

820
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,102
OK, come on, come on, let's go. Let's go.

821
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:20,478
Yup, yup.

822
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:23,685
It's twelve noon, and I'd like to call

823
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:27,269
the meeting of Waystar Royco to order.

824
00:42:27,293 --> 00:42:29,102
Roll call.
What...? Roll call?

825
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:30,727
Logan Roy. Yeah. You're here.

826
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:32,519
We've never done roll
call. What is roll call?

827
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:34,186
We're doing it today.
Why are we doing roll call?

828
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,977
Because that's how we do it. Right, Noah?

829
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:40,478
So Logan Roy is here...
Huh.

830
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:42,019
Frank Vernon, present.

831
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:44,727
Kendall Roy, absent.

832
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:46,561
Roman Roy.
Yo.

833
00:42:46,585 --> 00:42:49,519
Ewan Roy, absent.

834
00:42:49,543 --> 00:42:51,727
Ilona Shinoy, absent.

835
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:53,977
Datu Kassma.
Present.

836
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:55,478
Dewi Swann.
Here.

837
00:42:55,502 --> 00:42:58,478
Paul Chambers.
Happy to be here.

838
00:42:58,502 --> 00:43:00,852
Asha Kahn.
Here.

839
00:43:00,876 --> 00:43:02,977
Lawrence Yee.
Here.

840
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:04,269
Sir!

841
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:06,810
Stewy Hosseini.
I am here.

842
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,102
Mr. Chairman, we have a quorum.

843
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:12,852
Uh, we also welcome our
esteemed general counsel

844
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:15,186
Gerri Killman to the
meeting. Thanks, Gerri.

845
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,353
So everybody has a copy of the agenda

846
00:43:18,377 --> 00:43:20,019
and the minutes of the last meeting.

847
00:43:20,043 --> 00:43:21,603
Is that right?
Yes.

848
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:23,977
Do any of you have any questions

849
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,269
that have come to you
immediately after looking at them?

850
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:29,769
I know that I-I have a few thoughts...

851
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:31,377
we might have to take a look at.

852
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:34,019
What thoughts?

853
00:43:34,043 --> 00:43:35,563
Just wait a second and I'll get to it.

854
00:43:38,168 --> 00:43:40,709
OK. Who's this?

855
00:43:42,543 --> 00:43:45,061
Ewan? Well...

856
00:43:45,085 --> 00:43:46,894
you just can't keep away, huh?

857
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:50,186
Thought maybe I'd show up for once.

858
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,210
Watch the fun.

859
00:43:53,585 --> 00:43:54,852
Great to have you.

860
00:43:54,876 --> 00:43:56,644
They wouldn't let me in downstairs

861
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:57,852
without a passport.

862
00:43:57,876 --> 00:43:59,709
Has it started?

863
00:44:18,585 --> 00:44:20,519
Kendall. Hey, where are ya?

864
00:44:20,543 --> 00:44:21,727
We've already started, man.

865
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:23,227
We've started.

866
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:26,603
Hey. Tell Jess to put me
through the polycom. Yeah?

867
00:44:26,627 --> 00:44:28,394
So, let's move along

868
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:30,418
to item 3.1.

869
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:34,561
Frank.
Mm-hmm?

870
00:44:34,585 --> 00:44:37,561
What's "Performance
issues?" Sounds fucking vague.

871
00:44:37,585 --> 00:44:40,709
And why is it so high
on the fuckin' hit parade?

872
00:44:43,126 --> 00:44:45,436
I don't know if we're actually gonna hit
those today. Maybe we can bump those.

873
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,894
Sorry, I'm gonna have to get back to you.

874
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,810
Can we bump 'em?

875
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:51,293
OK, then. Let's bump it.

876
00:44:52,543 --> 00:44:54,561
Ohh. What the fuck's goin' on?

877
00:44:54,585 --> 00:44:57,394
I think Kendall wants to make a comment.

878
00:44:57,418 --> 00:45:01,061
He has a... a thing that
he's going to speak...

879
00:45:01,085 --> 00:45:03,102
I think Ilona is going to phone in, too.

880
00:45:03,126 --> 00:45:04,935
He's on the line.
I'm putting him through.

881
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:06,478
What is this? What the fuck is this?

882
00:45:06,502 --> 00:45:08,102
Hi, Kendall?

883
00:45:08,126 --> 00:45:11,144
Hey, guys. Can you hear me?

884
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:12,627
I apologize.

885
00:45:14,293 --> 00:45:15,436
I will be there shortly.

886
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,269
Where are we at?

887
00:45:17,293 --> 00:45:18,561
We are at your item.

888
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:20,043
Performance issues.

889
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:30,810
Uh... You want us to wait?

890
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:31,894
Where are you?

891
00:45:31,918 --> 00:45:33,935
Fuck that. We're movin' on.

892
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,394
Gerri, Noah,

893
00:45:35,418 --> 00:45:37,810
if we wanted to halt proceedings until...

894
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:39,685
We're not halting proceedings.

895
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:42,977
We're moving on.
No, no. It's OK. It's OK.

896
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:44,102
I can do this.

897
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:45,834
Dad, this is big.

898
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:49,269
Look...

899
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:51,478
I love my father.

900
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:52,977
OK? My father is a legend.

901
00:45:53,001 --> 00:45:55,353
I worship the ground he walks on.

902
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:58,436
Nothing will ever detract from
what he's built and what he's done.

903
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,727
But he is currently unfit
to run this company.

904
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:03,894
Speak up. I can't hear.

905
00:46:03,918 --> 00:46:05,977
Not only because of his
refusal to take the time

906
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:08,852
to recover from serious health issues,

907
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:11,353
but because every day he refuses to retire,

908
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:14,644
he is one day closer to
destroying his own legacy.

909
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:16,186
He took on levels of debt

910
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,394
that threatened the
very existence of our firm,

911
00:46:18,418 --> 00:46:20,519
he is lining up dead-weight acquisitions

912
00:46:20,543 --> 00:46:23,019
in a sector that he
has a historic regard for

913
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:24,769
but which is a non-growth area.

914
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:27,186
We face existential battles in scale,

915
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,227
and he is facing precisely
the wrong direction.

916
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:34,353
He is making decisions for a
future that he no longer understands,

917
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:36,685
and we don't have time for missteps.

918
00:46:36,709 --> 00:46:39,852
What used to take ten... Two, three years.

919
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:41,394
Our entire ice cap will melt.

920
00:46:41,418 --> 00:46:43,519
He is gambling our
last dollars at the track

921
00:46:43,543 --> 00:46:45,478
on a horse that's ready
for the glue factory,

922
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,769
and I am calling for a
vote of no confidence in him

923
00:46:47,793 --> 00:46:49,585
as CEO and chairman.

924
00:46:54,418 --> 00:46:55,894
Bullshit. No.

925
00:46:55,918 --> 00:46:58,603
I'm afraid since you are
the subject of the vote,

926
00:46:58,627 --> 00:47:01,144
you need to recuse yourself, Logan.

927
00:47:01,168 --> 00:47:04,478
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fuckin'
amateur hour at the fuckin' circus.

928
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:08,727
You don't get to vote, and you
don't get to comment, is the situation.

929
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:10,519
You really should leave the room.

930
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:12,186
OK, fine. Fine. Vote.

931
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,727
Would you mind?

932
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:15,311
Guys. Is he there?

933
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:16,935
Is he still in the room?

934
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,727
I'm sick. I can't move. Fuck that vote.

935
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:22,977
He can't be in the room. OK? Guys...

936
00:47:23,001 --> 00:47:24,894
Let the minutes reflect

937
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:28,102
that Logan Roy was asked to recuse himself.

938
00:47:28,126 --> 00:47:30,269
Let the minutes reflect that Logan Roy

939
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:32,311
shoved his boot up Frank's ass.

940
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:33,959
OK.

941
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:42,460
All in favor of the vote of
no confidence in Logan Roy?

942
00:47:57,126 --> 00:47:58,935
Me. My hand is raised.

943
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,227
More in sorrow than in anger.

944
00:48:01,251 --> 00:48:03,126
Oh, no shit, Judas.

945
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:06,561
Frank!

946
00:48:06,585 --> 00:48:08,810
Nice to see you back.

947
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:10,436
Asha?

948
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,019
I see you.

949
00:48:12,043 --> 00:48:13,810
And I see you, Logan.

950
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:17,644
Oh, Jesus, this is just
un-frickin'-believable.

951
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:20,061
Stewy? Stewy.

952
00:48:20,085 --> 00:48:21,810
Me. OK.

953
00:48:21,834 --> 00:48:25,269
Listen, as a major shareholder,

954
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:29,478
and in the absence
of any real clarity here,

955
00:48:29,502 --> 00:48:31,852
I think it's the view

956
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:37,019
that this is a family matter and abstain.

957
00:48:37,043 --> 00:48:40,043
Against.
Strongly against.

958
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:44,144
We have Ilona on the line.

959
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:45,935
Hello, Logan. Yes.

960
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:48,269
After consulting with my family,

961
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:51,353
I am voting in favor of the motion.

962
00:48:51,377 --> 00:48:53,519
Thanks for nothin', Ilona.

963
00:48:53,543 --> 00:48:54,543
Fuck off.

964
00:48:56,418 --> 00:48:58,085
Ewan?

965
00:49:00,876 --> 00:49:03,019
Go ahead.

966
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:04,418
What are we on, 4-2?

967
00:49:07,085 --> 00:49:08,685
Go on.

968
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:10,810
Yeah. Join the rats.

969
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:13,210
Let's finish this, huh?

970
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:17,543
I vote with Logan.

971
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:23,102
I think we should take the
time to consider this properly

972
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,810
when all parties are here.

973
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:26,977
Datu, we're voting now.

974
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:29,144
Logan, please, can you
stay out of the conversation?

975
00:49:29,168 --> 00:49:32,061
In which case, Logan.
I stick with Logan.

976
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:35,519
Kendall, you counted right there?

977
00:49:35,543 --> 00:49:37,478
You all right?

978
00:49:37,502 --> 00:49:42,019
Four against four, this is your best shot?

979
00:49:42,043 --> 00:49:44,019
Lawrence?

980
00:49:44,043 --> 00:49:47,353
I don't have a dog in this fight, Kendall.

981
00:49:47,377 --> 00:49:49,186
I abstain.

982
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,727
So, currently

983
00:49:51,751 --> 00:49:55,977
we've got four votes in
favor of Logan to remain,

984
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:58,394
four of stepping down, two abstentions.

985
00:49:58,418 --> 00:49:59,935
Uh, Gerri.

986
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:02,019
Do you want to say anything

987
00:50:02,043 --> 00:50:04,852
to speak to the senior
management teams' attitudes here?

988
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,894
Shut the...
Well, you know,

989
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:10,061
I'm an independent observer,

990
00:50:10,085 --> 00:50:12,269
non-voting, a general counsel,

991
00:50:12,293 --> 00:50:14,293
so I'm not sure that's appropriate?

992
00:50:16,377 --> 00:50:19,186
Right. Thanks.

993
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,852
Very...

994
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:23,293
professional.

995
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:27,102
Hey, Roman?

996
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:30,394
Roman.

997
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:33,102
Put your hand up, bro.

998
00:50:33,126 --> 00:50:34,269
Roman, can you hear me?

999
00:50:34,293 --> 00:50:36,436
Uh...
Is your hand up?

1000
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,186
Kendall, yeah. Hey. Are you there?

1001
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,102
Roman...

1002
00:50:41,126 --> 00:50:43,085
Uh, you're kind of cuttin' out.

1003
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,585
Roman...

1004
00:50:52,293 --> 00:50:54,769
He's off the line.

1005
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:56,377
Come on, son.

1006
00:51:02,168 --> 00:51:03,810
Roman.

1007
00:51:03,834 --> 00:51:06,335
Come on. Come on, come on.

1008
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:11,709
You better be smelling
your fuckin' armpit, Romulus.

1009
00:51:14,627 --> 00:51:16,293
Um...

1010
00:51:18,251 --> 00:51:20,644
I think it's a tough one, you know?

1011
00:51:20,668 --> 00:51:22,311
I think, uh...

1012
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:25,810
It's tough, but maybe...
Roman for me.

1013
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:27,810
I'm not sure we can count that for you.

1014
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,603
Roman?
Against.

1015
00:51:29,627 --> 00:51:32,810
He s-started to vote, I'm
not sure he can change that.

1016
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:35,061
He can fucking change.
You shouldn't be here,

1017
00:51:35,085 --> 00:51:37,102
you shouldn't be speaking here,
you should be out of this room.

1018
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:39,353
This is illegal.
Whatever.

1019
00:51:39,377 --> 00:51:41,727
If you count 'em out, deadlock.

1020
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:44,603
Continuity prevails. I'm chairman.

1021
00:51:44,627 --> 00:51:48,210
Casting vote. I win. It's fucking over!

1022
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:51,311
What's the vote?

1023
00:51:51,335 --> 00:51:53,353
My son.

1024
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:54,644
That was your best shot.

1025
00:51:54,668 --> 00:51:56,186
You lost.

1026
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,394
I think there's some doubt
as to whether he lost...

1027
00:51:58,418 --> 00:52:01,353
And Kendall, Frank, Asha, Ilona,

1028
00:52:01,377 --> 00:52:03,186
off the board, fired with immediate effect.

1029
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,519
I don't think you're able to do that.

1030
00:52:04,543 --> 00:52:05,810
Security!

1031
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,436
I am in the middle of
turning a fucking tanker.

1032
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,311
Frank, you're fired.
I have some doubt...

1033
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,834
I'm in the middle of
turning a fucking tanker!

1034
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:18,251
Do you hear?!

1035
00:52:21,293 --> 00:52:24,603
Frank! You're fired.

1036
00:52:24,627 --> 00:52:25,977
Without exit package.

1037
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:27,269
Asha, goodbye.

1038
00:52:27,293 --> 00:52:29,394
Somebody send a telegram to Ilona

1039
00:52:29,418 --> 00:52:31,644
telling her she's no longer required,

1040
00:52:31,668 --> 00:52:32,935
and my best to her cancer.

1041
00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:34,561
I think we all need to take a beat.

1042
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:37,269
Meh meh meh fuckin' meh.
Logan, stop.

1043
00:52:37,293 --> 00:52:40,019
Is it wise to fire the board

1044
00:52:40,043 --> 00:52:42,186
with the share price this weak,

1045
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,894
heading into a political fight?

1046
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:46,061
Take it like a fucking man. You're out.

1047
00:52:46,085 --> 00:52:48,727
You're fucked. You tried
to kill me, but you failed.

1048
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:51,085
And you're dead. Now fuck off!

1049
00:52:57,418 --> 00:53:00,102
Oh, go on, cry me a river.

1050
00:53:00,126 --> 00:53:01,478
Get the fuck out.

1051
00:53:01,502 --> 00:53:03,144
Straight out! Passes canceled.

1052
00:53:03,168 --> 00:53:05,269
We'll send along personal belongings.

1053
00:53:05,293 --> 00:53:07,102
Just need to get some things, OK?

1054
00:53:07,126 --> 00:53:08,894
No goodbyes! Thank you!

1055
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:10,377
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

1056
00:53:18,251 --> 00:53:21,293
And what the fuck am I gonna do with you?

1057
00:53:22,418 --> 00:53:23,918
I don't know, Dad.

1058
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:29,627
Jesus.

1059
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,061
Can I just get some stuff?
No. No.

1060
00:53:37,085 --> 00:53:38,751
Thank you.
OK.

1061
00:53:47,502 --> 00:53:48,709
He-e-ey!

1062
00:53:50,335 --> 00:53:52,144
God, that was the journey from hell.

1063
00:53:52,168 --> 00:53:54,709
Spent 30 minutes in a cab not moving.

1064
00:53:57,793 --> 00:53:58,834
Honey?

1065
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:04,293
Tom?

1066
00:54:05,793 --> 00:54:08,561
Hey. Hey.
Hey. You OK, sweetheart?

1067
00:54:08,585 --> 00:54:10,935
Yeah. I think somebody poisoned me.

1068
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,727
I'm working from home.

1069
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:14,810
Oh, someone poisoned you?

1070
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,478
Hmm.
Oh! With booze?

1071
00:54:17,502 --> 00:54:18,644
Hmm. Hmm.

1072
00:54:18,668 --> 00:54:20,061
Aw.

1073
00:54:20,085 --> 00:54:21,977
Hey. Hey.
Hey.

1074
00:54:22,001 --> 00:54:23,685
Mm.

1075
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:25,585
OK, I got you something.

1076
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:29,436
Oh, thank you.
I missed you.

1077
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,353
You only been away, like, 14 hours.

1078
00:54:32,377 --> 00:54:35,186
Yeah, well, sorry for missing you.

1079
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,644
Oh.

1080
00:54:37,668 --> 00:54:39,377
Yeah. What?

1081
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:43,519
What the fuck?

1082
00:54:43,543 --> 00:54:45,001
What? What's happened?

1083
00:54:48,001 --> 00:54:49,852
Well, more. T-Tell me more.

1084
00:54:49,876 --> 00:54:52,061
What's happened? Did it happen?

1085
00:54:52,085 --> 00:54:53,751
OK, call me right back.

1086
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,769
The world's blown up.

1087
00:54:57,793 --> 00:54:59,894
Oh, fuck!

1088
00:54:59,918 --> 00:55:01,644
What do you mean, "has it happened"?

1089
00:55:01,668 --> 00:55:03,769
Did you know?
What? No!

1090
00:55:03,793 --> 00:55:06,394
Fuckin' Kendall!
Has it happened?

1091
00:55:06,418 --> 00:55:08,685
Did... Has it happened?

1092
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:09,894
Wait!

1093
00:55:09,918 --> 00:55:12,269
Kendall? Call me back.

1094
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:13,685
You knew?
Yeah.

1095
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:15,935
I think too much "abolgoll" hurt my tummy.

1096
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:18,186
Connor. You heard?

1097
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,644
Yeah, Kendall called for a
vote of no confidence on Dad.

1098
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:24,935
Kendall? Who the fuck else knew about this?

1099
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:26,727
Roman did.
Roman knew?

1100
00:55:26,751 --> 00:55:30,311
I don't know why you'd
expect anything different.

1101
00:55:30,335 --> 00:55:33,055
Not a single one of them told me
about this. It's complete bullshit.

1102
00:55:34,377 --> 00:55:36,852
Oh, Shiv, you know I
don't like to take sides.

1103
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:38,478
But I'm on your side.

1104
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,876
Fuck you.

1105
00:55:41,585 --> 00:55:44,061
You knew?
Yeah, I tried to call you.

1106
00:55:44,085 --> 00:55:45,769
Not hard enough.
I did!

1107
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:48,186
He's fired half the board.
What about Kendall?

1108
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,019
Fired. Frank, Asha, fired.
What?

1109
00:55:51,043 --> 00:55:54,561
The rebels are getting
shot in the town square.

1110
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:56,418
I'll talk to you later, Tom.

1111
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:01,793
Are we the rebels?

1112
00:56:10,126 --> 00:56:12,603
Yes?
I have the White House.

1113
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:14,769
The president will join once you're on.

1114
00:56:14,793 --> 00:56:17,685
They're very apologetic.

1115
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:20,251
Tell him I'm on.
Yes, sir.

1116
00:56:23,751 --> 00:56:25,727
Yes, he's on.

1117
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:28,834
Hello, Mr. President. He'll
be with you momentarily.

1118
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:36,335
He'll be right there.

1119
00:56:44,335 --> 00:56:45,543
Thank you.

1120
00:56:55,335 --> 00:56:57,001
Mr. President.

1121
00:56:58,709 --> 00:57:01,502
Oh, much, much better.

1122
00:57:02,793 --> 00:57:04,502
No need for an apology.

1123
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:11,210
Well, you really had a terrorist problem.

1124
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:16,543
I've just taken down a terrorist myself.
