1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,796
I'm not letting you neanderthals
in to rape my company.

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:04,107
Daddy's boy.

3
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:06,915
How can we salvage this?
Do we need to sweeten the offer?

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:09,492
- Do you want to call your dad?
- Do you want to call your dad?

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,274
Everybody, this is cousin Craig.

6
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:14,482
- It's Greg.
- I'll... I'll answer to both.

7
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:15,649
I changed my mind.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,434
I'm staying on as head of the company.

9
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:19,491
You fucked me.

10
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,199
On the family trust,

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,732
I'm gonna add Marcy to myself
and you four.

12
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:26,231
I'm gonna have to talk to my lawyers.

13
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:28,441
What're you thinking, son?
She's very smart.

14
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:29,940
- Family first.
- Um, sure.

15
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,343
But I want to run the damn show.

16
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:33,395
And until it opens up,
chief operating officer.

17
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,566
We stick to the plan, I takeover.

18
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:37,469
- And you two, under me...
- Under you?

19
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,494
Can we think about it?

20
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,866
- Yeah, of course.
- I thought about it. Fuck you!

21
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:42,607
Sorry the other offer fell through.

22
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:43,981
But we fattened the goose nice...

23
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:45,992
I'm gonna eat you all.
One by fucking one.

24
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:47,671
What do you say, kids?

25
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:49,702
Our position is, this
doesn't quite work for us.

26
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:50,784
Dad?

27
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:52,711
Dad? Dad?!

28
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:56,242
Kendall. Dad is in the hospital.

29
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:11,232
Rava. Hey.

30
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:12,649
Uh, my dad's...

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,023
My dad's in the hospital.

32
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,107
Yeah, he had, I don't know,

33
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:19,190
I don't know what.

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,784
But, uh...

35
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:24,691
Yeah, I don't know if he's gonna be ok.

36
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:27,274
It's... yeah.

37
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:31,649
So... I don't know. I'm here with Jess.

38
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,982
We're just trying to get there...

39
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,299
What the...?

40
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,163
Can we just find a way
around the traffic, man?

41
00:01:36,174 --> 00:01:38,815
Just... just...
Just figure it out. Please!

42
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:49,987
Where's the icu?

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,982
Blood pressure...

44
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:09,200
Tests...

45
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:16,524
What's the situation? Can somebody...

46
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:17,585
Excuse me.

47
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,357
They're working on him.

48
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:20,857
What is this part of the hospital?

49
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,691
I mean, is this the best section?

50
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:24,274
Excuse me? Doctor,

51
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,649
is this the best part of the hospital?

52
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,982
Sorry. You know, we just...
We need to know.

53
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,940
The icu is the icu. This
is the best place for him.

54
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,607
Is this where you would
take your father?

55
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry. Can the team
have some space? Please?

56
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:38,215
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't
you worry about the medicine,

57
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,566
not the fucking feng shui?

58
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,332
Let's let the gentleman do his job.

59
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:42,357
Thank you.

60
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,357
- Let's do this for dad.
- Thank you.

61
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:45,576
Sorry.

62
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:15,757
- Synced and corrected by shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

63
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,399
Do they know who we are?

64
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:27,149
- I don't know.
- Are they sandbagging us?

65
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:28,982
- Do they know who he is?
- I don't know.

66
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:30,482
- Shall we call mom?
- What?

67
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:32,357
No. There's like
a million people to call.

68
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,691
She's probably just make it
about herself, anyway.

69
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,274
Come on. Your mom's a maniac,
she's not a monster.

70
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:39,274
Folks, we need you
to wait through there, please.

71
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:40,299
Hi. I'm sorry.

72
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,215
We're getting mixed messages here.
We have no clue what's going on.

73
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:44,399
We will be with you

74
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,732
as soon as we have an assessment.

75
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:47,732
Ok, well, that's not good enough.

76
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:49,857
We need to know what's happening. Now.

77
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,399
The socio-economic health
of multiple continents

78
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,815
is dependent on his well-being.

79
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:58,367
The socio-economic health
of multiple continents?

80
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:01,232
Kendall. Everyone.

81
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:02,482
We have an area we can go to.

82
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:04,023
They'll keep us posted.

83
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:12,441
So, look, take me
through what happened exactly.

84
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:14,691
Uh, I don't know, exactly.

85
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:17,315
It was weird. Um, it happened fast,

86
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,455
- we were just sitting there...
- We were just talking.

87
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,524
We were talking, shiv kind of started

88
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:24,112
- hard-balling dad a little bit.
- I wasn't hard-balling him.

89
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,607
A brain hemorrhage doesn't come
from some chit-chat, asshole.

90
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,691
So it's definitely a brain hemorrhage?
Is that what they said?

91
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:31,399
Somebody said that, right?

92
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:33,369
- Somebody said hemorrhage?
- Or stroke? I...

93
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,474
- The ambulance...
- A stroke is a hemorrhage.

94
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:36,524
- It is?
- Yes.

95
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:39,065
Did someone say "hemorrhage,"
or is it just us who said it?

96
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:40,149
It could be an aneurism.

97
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,815
Why aren't we chasing this?

98
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,357
I'll chase.

99
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:46,107
Hey, uh, is there any...

100
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:48,649
Did dad ever talk to any
of you guys about cryogenics?

101
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:52,898
You're insane. Look, I don't want

102
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:54,691
to be given the runaround

103
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,732
by doctor-fucking-suny purchase
medical school here.

104
00:05:57,742 --> 00:06:00,107
We need to know
who the top players are, ok?

105
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:01,566
Who's the top dog in this hospital?

106
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:03,149
Have you talked to dad's neurologist?

107
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:05,898
Kendall, stop acting like
the king of the hospital.

108
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:09,315
We're all trying to do our
best, so just fuck off.

109
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:10,607
I'm on it. Ok?

110
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:13,065
According to this,
it sounds like a stroke,

111
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:15,773
but it could be
an acute subdural hematoma.

112
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:18,274
Great. Get in there
and operate, doctor Google.

113
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:20,327
He once talked to me about cryogenics.

114
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,898
What? Wouldn't that just be typical?

115
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:24,362
All the other billionaires are
strolling around in new bodies,

116
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:27,104
but not dad, because we were too
embarrassed to actually discuss it.

117
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:28,968
He didn't talk to you about cryogenics.

118
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,482
You talked to him about cryogenics

119
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:32,281
because you're obsessed with cryogenics.

120
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,815
- I'm not really, Kendall.
- And what he didn't tell you,

121
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:36,232
and what I'm telling you now,

122
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:37,566
is that you are an idiot.

123
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:39,399
Sticks and stones, Kenny.

124
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,815
Yeah, I know.

125
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,982
And on his birthday, too?
It's so shitty.

126
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:44,441
So what's happening now?

127
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,482
Are you staying at the hospital?

128
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:47,732
I guess.

129
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,274
I mean, I think I've got a job,

130
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,441
but I don't know.

131
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,898
Logan said I did,

132
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:53,482
but marcia was the only one to hear it,

133
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:56,566
so... and then he tragically,

134
00:06:56,576 --> 00:06:58,607
you know, like, whatever.

135
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,815
Well, what sort of job?
Is it a good job?

136
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:02,149
I don't know. Like,

137
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:04,649
could be anything.

138
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,773
And I have, like, 20 bucks left.

139
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:08,482
The world is so fucked up.

140
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:11,649
I am not sending you
any more money, Greg.

141
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:12,691
Step up.

142
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,274
I'm not asking you to send me...

143
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:15,315
Look,

144
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:17,815
just make sure about the job.

145
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,815
- All right?
- Yeah, I know.

146
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:22,315
Hey, do you have cash?

147
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:26,325
Yeah. Uh...

148
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,583
No, just my last twenty.

149
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:29,709
That's fine. Thanks.

150
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,242
Um...

151
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,274
I just got mugged by shiv.

152
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:40,879
Born in humble
circumstances in dundee, Scotland,

153
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,856
shortly before the outbreak
of the second world war,

154
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,023
Logan Roy grew up in poverty,

155
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,857
but died one of the richest

156
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,399
and most powerful men in America.

157
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,232
His widowed mother took the decision...

158
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:53,857
It's an atn obituary.

159
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:57,107
They want us to ok it
in case they have to run it.

160
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:59,149
Is it nice?

161
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,441
I mean, it's made by
his own news division.

162
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,524
Doesn't say he was a prick.

163
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,773
You want to watch it?

164
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:10,200
No.

165
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:13,482
I would really love to see you.

166
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:16,773
Yes, it's appropriate. It could
hardly be more appropriate.

167
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:17,815
Ok?

168
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:20,482
Yeah, ok. Ok, good.

169
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:21,857
- Hey, Jess?
- Mm-hmm?

170
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:24,232
There's nothing in here about our mom.

171
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:26,399
Or Connor's. They need to be included.

172
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:28,399
Yeah.

173
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:32,566
Pj says Aziz kahn at Mayo
clinic is the best there is.

174
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:34,898
Sarah says Ann wieman at nyu.

175
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:37,566
Ann wieman? Is that...
That's not who I have.

176
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,315
Well, it's the name I have.

177
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:41,149
Can you tell Sarah to give her a call?

178
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,940
- Sure.
- Hey, Rome.

179
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,369
- Do you have regular?
- No, I've got...

180
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,482
Now I'm strapped.
Was there any change at all?

181
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:49,107
- Hey, you guys.
- What?

182
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:50,898
Could I have the change?

183
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:54,023
What is this? People are
sending shit already?

184
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,950
It's from Lawrence yee at vaulter.

185
00:08:57,786 --> 00:09:00,441
Call him and tell him that
is not fucking appreciated.

186
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:01,559
Mm-hmm.

187
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:05,149
- Kendall, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you, Gerri.

188
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,315
Can you give me five?

189
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:08,311
We need to talk.

190
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:10,364
Over here, ok?

191
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:20,482
Obviously the nominating
committee, the board,

192
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:24,274
has a plan in the event
of Logan's incapacitation.

193
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:26,149
Sorry, do I need to hear this right now?

194
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,195
You do.

195
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:29,023
In the event that we, uh,

196
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,691
continue on our trajectory

197
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:33,149
of his current consciousness,

198
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,315
we're gonna need to announce a plan

199
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,732
by around 6:30, before the markets open,

200
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:41,107
in order to avoid
a lot of funky chowder.

201
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:42,732
Did you say funky chowder?

202
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:44,023
We've set up down here.

203
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,732
What have you set up?

204
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:47,649
You're gonna want a place to just be,

205
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,315
and chill, you know?

206
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:51,524
We talked to some of the
trustees of the hospital,

207
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:53,315
so everybody knows who's who.

208
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:56,482
Yeah. It's not a war room yet,
but, um...

209
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:58,492
But if we need one, it's available.

210
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:07,815
Jesus.

211
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,399
Uh, so there's a bathroom
through there...

212
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,982
- Hi, karolina...
- Hi.

213
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:13,065
Thank you, guys.

214
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:14,773
So I have dewi and asha

215
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,107
from the nominating committee
on the line.

216
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,607
Kendall's here,
and you're on speaker, guys.

217
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,043
So sorry to hear about the news.

218
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,239
Likewise.

219
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,065
As you know, our standing plan
in the event of Logan's...

220
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:31,232
Absence, is to separate
his ceo and chairman roles.

221
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:33,107
You'll become acting ceo,

222
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:35,815
frank stays on as coo.

223
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:38,441
We'll need to act fast.
Stabilize the stock price.

224
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:39,524
Dewi? Dewi?

225
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:42,357
I'm sorry...

226
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,357
My dad is my focus right now, ok?

227
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,815
Of course, it's just that
there's a problem

228
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,232
in terms of the optics

229
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:51,409
if what happened earlier today
between you two gets out.

230
00:10:53,492 --> 00:10:56,232
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

231
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:58,274
Sure. Well...

232
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,691
And then there's the problem with frank.

233
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,399
- As in?
- Logan fired him

234
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,107
and promoted Roman.

235
00:11:05,117 --> 00:11:07,232
Roman?

236
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:08,576
Jesus.

237
00:11:12,576 --> 00:11:14,649
Look, I'm sorry, I...

238
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:17,566
I can't get into this right now, guys.

239
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,773
No, of course.

240
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:20,576
You are in no fit state.

241
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:32,242
But here's my take, ok?

242
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:37,284
My dad got sick today, right?

243
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:41,065
I don't know, I mean, nobody knows

244
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,357
when he started acting out of character,

245
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:47,566
but, like, he didn't seem great
from the morning on,

246
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:50,649
and there's no paper
on any of the moves made today.

247
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:52,649
- Right, Gerri?
- Uh...

248
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:53,732
Nothing meaningful.

249
00:11:53,742 --> 00:11:55,898
Yeah, it was words.
Words are just, what?

250
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:56,965
Nothing.

251
00:11:56,976 --> 00:11:58,482
Complicated air flow.

252
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:03,982
So, I mean, if I was saying
what actually happened today,

253
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:05,783
it would be nothing.

254
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,524
Well, that certainly

255
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:10,566
makes things simpler
from our point of view.

256
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,607
Do you think you can get
the family behind it?

257
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:14,566
Yes.

258
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:16,149
And frank?

259
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,200
Sure.

260
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:28,732
Dude, can't we just talk here?

261
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:30,815
You know Connor's invited Willa down?

262
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:32,441
Ugh. What?! Here?!

263
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,065
What's the deal with their deal?

264
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:38,023
Unlike me, he has
no sense of boundaries.

265
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,315
What the fuck?

266
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,940
It's stale, but it's empty, I think.

267
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,149
- Hello?
- You wanna do a play?

268
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:46,149
No, I, um, just wanted to...

269
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,982
I've been thinking
that maybe this might be

270
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:52,482
really tough on marcia.

271
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:54,065
Yeah, you're thinkin' that?

272
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:57,524
What, will she put all her
inheritance into gold or oil?

273
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:59,357
No, I just... no, I...

274
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,482
Look, I know that, like, the
trust only comes into play

275
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:04,190
if certain things happen...

276
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,649
Ahem. Yeah, he's dead, or brain dead.

277
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:09,065
Yeah, but I was thinkin', like...

278
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:11,773
Wouldn't it be nice for dad to wake up

279
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:13,732
and for all of us to have signed,

280
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:15,149
like he wanted?

281
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,732
You know, like a nice gesture?

282
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:17,982
And if he doesn't wake up,

283
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:20,441
we've basically signed over to marcia

284
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:23,649
the power to choose the new dad.

285
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:27,566
So... ok. So, for the record,

286
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:31,482
you are declining to sign
on the change of trust?

287
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,023
- For the record?
- Yeah.

288
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:34,649
What the fuck is this, mccarthyism?

289
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,607
I'm not declining, I'm just not...

290
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:38,815
I'm not "clining." What the f...

291
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:40,857
Ok. No. Ok, just, you know,

292
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:44,315
that just seems very shitty
under the circumstances.

293
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:45,421
What circumstances?

294
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:48,088
Well, you did make
her husband's brain explode.

295
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:49,566
- Fuck you, man!
- Ow!

296
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:51,232
- Ohh!
- Wait...

297
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:53,065
- Stop it!
- You shit!

298
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:55,107
What, are you fuckin' insane?

299
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:01,149
No! No!

300
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:06,315
He...

301
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:07,732
He doesn't deserve this.

302
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:10,857
It's just so unfair.

303
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,242
He's a great... man.

304
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:23,940
He, like, let me
come to his birthday lunch.

305
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,117
And he offered me a job.

306
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,065
Right?

307
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:31,607
He doesn't deserve this.

308
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:35,773
And... so, if there's
anything that I can do,

309
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:37,451
let me know.

310
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:43,107
Actually, there is something.

311
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:44,940
- Ok.
- Can you go to the apartment

312
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,065
and get his bed things and slippers?

313
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:50,065
The ones with the dark checks.

314
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:51,607
You don't mind?

315
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:54,773
No, no. I'd be...

316
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:58,315
Respectfully, uh, somberly willing.

317
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:59,742
Thank you.

318
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:03,524
- Now?
- Please.

319
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:05,357
Ok. All right.

320
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:10,149
Marcia, we get can get Colin or the
driver to go and get his things.

321
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,940
I don't need this
fly buzzing in my face.

322
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,732
Slippers, slippers, slippers,
slippers, slippers.

323
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,492
Yeah, don't fuck it up.

324
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:27,107
Fuckin' long legs. Greg! Hey,
I need a favor from you.

325
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:28,482
What's up?

326
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:30,732
Dad had some papers
he wanted us to sign,

327
00:15:30,742 --> 00:15:32,524
and they're in some envelopes,

328
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:34,691
just pick 'em up at the
house, and bring 'em.

329
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,149
- Yeah. Where are the papers?
- Yeah.

330
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,823
They're in the house somewhere.

331
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,562
In envelopes... they're
just in the house!

332
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,190
- You got it?
- Ok. I was imagining...

333
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,732
Oh, you're fucking tall. This
is hurting my goddamn neck.

334
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,524
I have to go. Ok? Just find the papers,

335
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,023
and bring 'em back.

336
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,399
Papers, and... and...
They're gonna be just...

337
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:49,857
I am so done with this conversation.

338
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:53,274
- Just handle it, ok?
- All right. Yeah.

339
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,149
Better not fuck this one up.
I don't want Logan Roy's newspapers

340
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,274
goin' through my trash cans.

341
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:21,524
- Oh, my god! We've killed...
- Logan.

342
00:16:21,534 --> 00:16:23,023
We're bastards!

343
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,315
Turn that off.

344
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:27,524
Roman, no. Turn it off.

345
00:16:27,534 --> 00:16:29,399
- We've killed...
- Logan.

346
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:30,732
We're...

347
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:32,232
What are they saying?

348
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,566
Just rumors, you know.

349
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,482
He was taken to the hospital,

350
00:16:36,492 --> 00:16:38,065
some of Twitter says he's dead,

351
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:40,232
and also a good deal of, um,

352
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:44,732
of rejoicing at our father's
potential demise.

353
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:47,149
Can we find out who these fuckers are

354
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,857
and, like... report them?

355
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,815
Or just, like, screen grab their shit.

356
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:54,940
- Ok.
- So we know? Yeah?

357
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,190
So, I don't know
where Kendall is, but...

358
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,441
Hi. Really sorry, you guys.

359
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,857
Thanks, Willa.

360
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:03,149
Why don't we sit over here.

361
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,242
Oh, there's Ken.

362
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,441
It's gross.

363
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:10,649
Hey.

364
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:12,441
News is out.

365
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:14,117
Ok, right. Well...

366
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:18,783
So, um, listen.

367
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:23,691
I don't even want to think about this,

368
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:26,232
but I just spoke
to the nominating committee,

369
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:28,940
and, uh...

370
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,441
The thing is that the plan

371
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,940
is to announce that I
take over from dad.

372
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,149
- Well, no.
- Excuse me?

373
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:37,482
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

374
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:39,441
we're waiting for
the results of the scan.

375
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:40,854
It's a pointless conversation.

376
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:43,065
Ok, well, let's talk about it.

377
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:44,940
I can't talk about it. I'm upset.

378
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,482
Hey! I'm upset too.

379
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:48,274
Oh, not too upset to go and fucking plot

380
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,857
- with the suits.
- Fuck you! Ok?

381
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:52,649
I could hardly hear them for
the blood rushing in my ears.

382
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:54,195
Isn't there a plan anyways? Like...

383
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,315
Yes, there's a plan.

384
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,149
That's what I'm fucking telling you.

385
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,524
The plan is that frank and I
will take over...

386
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:02,441
- Frank was fired. So..
- Yeah.

387
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,357
Ok. Well, I mean, let's d-discuss

388
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,023
and just see where we are, right?

389
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:10,857
I'm not doing this.

390
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:15,065
If dad dies, I don't want to be
talking about this shit when he dies.

391
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:16,492
He won't die.

392
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:24,367
Yeah, this is great. Thank you.

393
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:31,023
Hey, man.

394
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:33,065
Sorry, I'm... I'm really sorry,

395
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:34,691
but I don't have any money for the cab.

396
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,482
I'm sorry, sir, do I know you?

397
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:39,023
Yeah, I-I was here a little earlier.

398
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,399
I got assaulted a little in there.

399
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:42,857
So can you pay for the cab, please?

400
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,441
She was supposed to call,

401
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:46,982
but maybe she didn't
because there's an emergency,

402
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,232
uh, happening.

403
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:49,857
Sir, I'm sorry,

404
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,357
I don't know who you are.

405
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,701
Um...

406
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,898
Sss...

407
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:58,773
Ok, so he's not gonna lend me the money.

408
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:01,691
So, I don't know, um...

409
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:04,857
You know, he... pretty much,
he owes you your money.

410
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:06,441
He owes me the...?

411
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:08,701
You better give me the money, dude.

412
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,815
You guys need to work
this out for yourselves,

413
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:17,292
because basically one of you
guys hasn't got $14, ok?

414
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,857
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,200
Hello, Mrs. Roy?

416
00:19:57,992 --> 00:19:59,940
Knock knock.

417
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,409
Thank you.

418
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:24,117
I'm so sorry.

419
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:28,617
It's so weird.

420
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:32,441
I actually like hospitals.

421
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:36,023
Lots of people don't. But they're safe.

422
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:39,149
The weird thing for me

423
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,065
is that I was, well,

424
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,315
I'd been intending to talk to Logan,

425
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:48,982
you know, and make a... make a proposal,

426
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:51,950
a very decent proposal, to shiv.

427
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,982
Actually been meaning to ask
for his blessing for a while,

428
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:02,701
but, uh... now it's very difficult.

429
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:05,649
You need to find the right time

430
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,023
for these conversations.

431
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,200
Right.

432
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:12,065
The weird thing I'm thinkin' now is,

433
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:14,992
do you think Logan
would still like to be asked?

434
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,065
You know? I mean, I know he can't reply,

435
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:21,815
but would he appreciate the gesture

436
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:24,149
if he was told about it later?

437
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,524
Or even in the case...

438
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:30,357
In the case of the worst... case,

439
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:33,033
would it have been nice
to have asked his body?

440
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:38,315
Rumors continue to
circulate about the health of...

441
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:40,065
Hey, hey. They're ready.

442
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:42,149
They have the results.

443
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,742
Ok. Fuck.

444
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:46,149
You ok?

445
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,773
Yeah. Yeah. He'll be fine.

446
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:49,905
He's probably in there eating
a fucking chicken bucket

447
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,732
and yelling at someone.

448
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:53,357
He's had a hemorrhagic stroke,

449
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:55,190
a bleed in the deep right hemisphere

450
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,928
that put pressure on the
thalamus and the brain stem,

451
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:59,020
and that's what caused
a loss of consciousness.

452
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:01,190
So, what, do you operate?

453
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,898
We don't do that with deep bleeds,
especially in older patients.

454
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,856
- He's not an older patient.
- Dude, he just turned 80.

455
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:10,773
But physically, he's, like, still in
his 70s, and he's in great shape.

456
00:22:10,783 --> 00:22:12,399
The evidence is that operating

457
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:14,524
in situations like these
isn't worthwhile.

458
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,732
So, then, what do you do?

459
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:19,274
You can't do nothing.

460
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:21,232
We will carry out regular observations,

461
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:23,566
and hopefully we'll see
some improvement soon.

462
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:27,065
That's not good enough.
Right, Dr. Judith? That's...

463
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:28,399
It's an excellent department.

464
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:31,107
Well, thank you for your input,

465
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:33,262
but you'll understand
if we check out our options.

466
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:35,815
My assistant's been in touch
with Ann wieman at nyu,

467
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:37,649
and we might move dad there.

468
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:40,441
No. He stays here.

469
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:42,607
He gets better here.

470
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:45,274
Well, we can discuss.

471
00:22:45,284 --> 00:22:46,940
We'll discuss and get back to you.

472
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,149
No. No discussion.

473
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,940
I am his next of kin. I am his proxy.

474
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,325
I am in charge. Thank you.

475
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,078
Good. Well...

476
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,910
We'll move Logan
to a suite in Greenberg.

477
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:06,773
I'll show you the way.

478
00:23:06,783 --> 00:23:09,274
I'm sure you have some questions.

479
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:11,315
Feel free to ask me on the way up.

480
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:20,992
- I'm sorry, Ken.
- Thanks for coming over.

481
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:24,482
Ok, so look.

482
00:23:24,492 --> 00:23:26,441
We don't know what's going on.

483
00:23:26,451 --> 00:23:28,982
He could be fine; He could not.

484
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,482
Either way, he's not
gonna be back tomorrow,

485
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,149
so, long story short,

486
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:36,315
will you carry on as coo,
step up on the board...

487
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:38,065
- Become acting chairman.
- Yes.

488
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,524
- No.
- What?

489
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:42,315
He fired me, Ken.

490
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:44,065
He... I...

491
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:47,815
Look, I don't know if he even
knew what he was saying...

492
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:49,315
If his brain was working.

493
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:51,315
His brain was working fine.

494
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:53,524
Well, whatever else,
there's no proof, legally,

495
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:55,815
- that yesterday even happened.
- That's not the problem.

496
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:58,232
- So what's the problem?
- I don't want to be chairman.

497
00:23:58,242 --> 00:24:02,190
I am just an attendant lord,
here to swell a scene or two.

498
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,232
What the fuck does that mean?

499
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,524
Come on, don't do that.

500
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:07,893
We could do great things together.

501
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:10,607
So what do you need, frank?

502
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:14,566
A jazillion dollars in unmarked bitcoin.

503
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:16,357
I don't have a price, Ken.

504
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,357
- Frank, I don't understand.
- Ju... we'll talk.

505
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:21,274
There's a lot of mess
to be cleaned up, Kendall,

506
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:22,898
but you can do it, son.

507
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:24,857
You can.

508
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:27,107
And there's nothing I can say
to change your mind?

509
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:30,107
I'm sorry about your father.

510
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:33,190
And good luck, Kenny.

511
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Yeah?

512
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,482
I told Greg to bring
the change of trust.

513
00:25:04,492 --> 00:25:05,815
- What?
- And when he does,

514
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:07,315
I think we should sign it.

515
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:10,732
I... I'm not doing anything
without my lawyer present.

516
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,898
Ok. Well, I'm going to sign it,
I'm getting Connor to sign it.

517
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:16,908
It's gonna make you look pretty
fucking heartless when you don't.

518
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:20,982
Don't give me a fuckin' scary look.

519
00:25:20,992 --> 00:25:23,451
You hit me, I will fuck you up.

520
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:25,940
Ahh, fuck.

521
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,950
Yeah.

522
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:30,149
God, you're so annoying.

523
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,451
Shut up.

524
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,691
- Hello?
- Greg.

525
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:02,649
Hey. Did you find those
contracts Roman asked for?

526
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:06,232
Uh, I... yes, I got 'em.

527
00:26:06,242 --> 00:26:08,607
Oh, I think you have the wrong ones.

528
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:09,732
Uh, ok.

529
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,691
Um... right.

530
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:14,482
What, uh, what shall I do?

531
00:26:14,492 --> 00:26:17,315
Look, there's a lot of confusion.

532
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,232
'Cause if you have any doubt,
maybe you can't find them,

533
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:21,524
and that might be simplest.

534
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:22,732
But if I do,

535
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:23,940
'cause I...

536
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,815
I think I have the right ones here.

537
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,691
Don't bring them in.

538
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:29,149
Did he change his mind?

539
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,149
No. I'm just telling you:

540
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,732
Don't bring them in.

541
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:35,607
Ok. Ok. S...

542
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:37,815
All right, I get... I get it.

543
00:26:37,825 --> 00:26:40,232
So, who's the...

544
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:42,357
Like, what's the chain of command here?

545
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,107
Are you the more senior sibling?

546
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:45,149
Greg,

547
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:46,607
it's simple.

548
00:26:46,617 --> 00:26:49,065
This is a favor
I'd like you to do for me,

549
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,982
and I'd like you to be discreet.

550
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:53,607
You stay for a while,
you can't find them,

551
00:26:53,617 --> 00:26:55,524
you come back. Ok?

552
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:57,867
- Ok.
- Thank you.

553
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:22,539
This is better.

554
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:36,566
Um...

555
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,732
Look, so, I know you don't
want to talk about this,

556
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:43,107
I'm just informing you,
Roman as a board member

557
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:44,691
and shiv as a shareholder,

558
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:47,982
I'll be taking temporary charge
as ceo and chairman.

559
00:27:47,992 --> 00:27:50,357
Frank is not interested
in the position at present.

560
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,607
No. I'm sorry, but even
if we were talking about this,

561
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:56,232
which we are not,
it wouldn't necessarily be you.

562
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:58,607
I'm sorry, then
who the fuck would it be?

563
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:00,274
I don't know. Anyone.

564
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:01,898
It could be me.

565
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:04,940
Are you insane?

566
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,524
- Dad made me coo.
- I don't think so, dude.

567
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:09,691
Dad wasn't thinking straight.

568
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:11,607
I think he was.

569
00:28:11,617 --> 00:28:14,441
You? The chief operating officer?

570
00:28:14,451 --> 00:28:16,607
- Yup.
- I mean, if that wasn't a sign

571
00:28:16,617 --> 00:28:19,441
he was loco in the coco,
I don't know what is.

572
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:21,399
Well, I don't see it that way.

573
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:24,441
Come on. It was
a negotiating position, Rome.

574
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:26,023
He was fuckin' playing you

575
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:28,607
to get you to sign the change of trust.

576
00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:30,691
Do you even know
what it fucking involves?

577
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:32,773
I mean, he conked out mid-game.

578
00:28:32,783 --> 00:28:34,482
Are you calling me a dipshit?

579
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:36,898
No. I love you, man, but
you're not a serious person.

580
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:40,023
All right, fuck you. He's alive,
you're not the fuckin' boss.

581
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,940
All right! Come on. Let's
not throw shit around.

582
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,107
We're in the middle, so let's
just sit tight. No sudden moves.

583
00:28:46,117 --> 00:28:48,315
We need to move. The markets are gonna

584
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:49,815
want to know who's behind the wheel.

585
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:51,482
We need to control the narrative.

586
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:53,898
"Control the narrative." You
probably yell that when you cum.

587
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:56,315
"Oh! Control the narrative!
Oh! Control it...

588
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:58,482
Control the narrative! Uhh..."

589
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:00,315
Fuck you. We're in a hospital.

590
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:01,357
Everyone knows.

591
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:03,171
We have to say something.

592
00:29:03,182 --> 00:29:05,699
No. Actually, we don't. 'Cause
no one knows how serious it is.

593
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,149
So we don't have to say anything.

594
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,482
Actually, we do. The sec. There
are rules, there are laws...

595
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:14,482
Oh, no. The law?
Well, we can't break the law.

596
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,023
Hey, karolina?

597
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:18,857
Has a ceo ever been out of action

598
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:21,065
and people haven't been told?

599
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:25,149
Um, not that I can think of.
There was apple, but that...

600
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,482
Right, but if we...
Wanted to drag our feet on this,

601
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:31,190
until we figure the moves...

602
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,149
Well, once we do know,

603
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:35,815
there's a duty to shareholders
to let people...

604
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:38,190
Yeah, but I don't...
I don't know what we know.

605
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,315
I mean, this could be
an allergic reaction.

606
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:41,898
- It could be the flu.
- Oh, come on.

607
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:44,023
Look at the fuckin' orchids.
This is out there.

608
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:47,534
It's like we're being held
hostage in the Honolulu airport.

609
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:53,232
But if we wanted to say something,
you know, other than...

610
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:54,982
It's called a lie, shiv.

611
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:58,492
When you say the thing
that's not, that's a lie.

612
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:02,732
We'll need to make a holding statement.

613
00:30:02,742 --> 00:30:05,399
Of course, I'm open to your suggestions

614
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:07,357
on how to... finesse it.

615
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:10,982
Perfect. We'll make a decision
and get back to you shortly.

616
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,242
Ok.

617
00:30:29,742 --> 00:30:32,023
Logan Roy, ceo and chairman

618
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:34,311
- of waystar corporation...
- So, what do you think I do?

619
00:30:34,322 --> 00:30:36,691
Well, I don't know. What did she say?

620
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,982
Roman said bring in the papers,

621
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:41,149
shiv said don't bring in the papers.

622
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:44,065
Well, I guess you need to decide
which one of them is more important?

623
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:47,232
I guess Roman's... in the company,

624
00:30:47,242 --> 00:30:50,441
but shiv seems like,
I don't know, more bossy?

625
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:54,107
All right. Well, can you just
take some of the papers?

626
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:56,524
Plus, I don't know about these slippers.

627
00:30:56,534 --> 00:30:59,399
Like, they're all plaid.

628
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:01,149
Does "checked" mean plaid?

629
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,857
'Cause then there's gingham,
there's tartan...

630
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:07,107
It's like a crisscross
fuckin' minefield.

631
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:08,649
Oh, fuck the slippers, Greg.

632
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,190
You have to strategize.

633
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,607
I'm trying to strategize, mom, with you!

634
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:14,242
But you won't strategize.

635
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:31,732
Hey. What's up, Kendall?

636
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:33,566
You mix me up with your sponsor?

637
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:36,482
Listen, I'm just calling
to issue a reminder.

638
00:31:36,492 --> 00:31:40,065
Your pecker's in my pocket, ok,

639
00:31:40,075 --> 00:31:42,232
dickless dickleby?

640
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:43,898
You do what I say.

641
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:46,023
Let others say what they want,
but we stay dark.

642
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:49,232
You get me? No reporting
on what went down yesterday,

643
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:50,482
the turmoil.

644
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,149
Well, I can do whatever I want,

645
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,815
because vaulter and our satellite sites

646
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:55,940
have editorial independence...

647
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,149
As set out in
that piece of paper you signed.

648
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,982
You know what
that piece of paper is to me?

649
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:02,857
Nothing. Ok?

650
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:06,023
I'd jerk off on that paper and
send it to you as a greeting card.

651
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:08,566
"Mum's the word,"

652
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:10,159
motherfucker.

653
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:28,815
Hey. Sorry to bother you so late.

654
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:31,190
Hey, let's put something together

655
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,357
about the Roy family shitshow.

656
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:36,065
So, and I don't want to get into this,

657
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:38,315
but maybe we should just

658
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:40,399
cut off the whole Kendall ceo thing

659
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:43,190
so that it doesn't get painful.

660
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,982
Well, I mean, I'm not looking for it,

661
00:32:45,992 --> 00:32:48,107
but I guess I'm already coo,

662
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:49,732
so one more step...

663
00:32:49,742 --> 00:32:51,691
It's not gonna be you.

664
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:54,441
- Because?
- Come on.

665
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:57,023
- I don't know what that means.
- Yes, you do.

666
00:32:57,033 --> 00:32:59,232
Well, it doesn't matter who does it.

667
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:01,691
It's just temporary, so anyone will do.

668
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,857
Yeah, sure. Anyone.

669
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:05,357
- Tom.
- Tom?

670
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:07,950
Ok, fine.

671
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,607
Karl.

672
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:13,107
Bleahh.

673
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:16,232
Prick. Eva?

674
00:33:16,242 --> 00:33:17,607
- Cunt.
- Ok.

675
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:18,898
So, who?

676
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:21,107
Someone dad trusts.

677
00:33:21,117 --> 00:33:23,023
But dad doesn't trust anyone,
except frank,

678
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:25,409
and he fired frank
for shits and giggles.

679
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:28,732
- Gerri?
- Uhh...

680
00:33:28,742 --> 00:33:30,815
I don't love Gerri.

681
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:33,107
But I don't hate Gerri.

682
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:34,898
So, Gerri.

683
00:33:34,908 --> 00:33:36,576
I'll talk to her.

684
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,399
So, Gerri.

685
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:44,857
How ya doin'?

686
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:47,232
Oh, I'm fine.

687
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:50,107
This is where they brought
baird, so it's a little...

688
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:51,149
Baird?

689
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:53,815
Yeah, baird. My husband.

690
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,940
Shiv's godfather?

691
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,566
Oh, does he, um... with the tortoise?

692
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:00,649
Yeah.

693
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,441
Fuck yeah, of course.

694
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:05,274
- How is he?
- He's dead.

695
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:08,659
I know. I know. I remember... you...

696
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:14,566
So, uh, Gerri, uh,

697
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:19,940
just wanted to say thanks for
captaining us through this shitstorm.

698
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:23,649
Um, you do a good job,

699
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,441
Gerri, you, uh,

700
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:30,399
you're, um, you're a real good job-doer.

701
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,441
I suck at the whole
corporate flirt thing.

702
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:34,732
You know, I just...

703
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:37,649
I like to lube up and fuck, you know?

704
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,441
- Ok.
- Ok.

705
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:43,232
So, um... for me and shiv,

706
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:47,274
the whole Kendall thing doesn't work.

707
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:50,815
So we were thinkin'...
General counsel...

708
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:52,815
You know where the bodies are buried.

709
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:55,023
You probably buried 'em yourself.

710
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:56,898
So...

711
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:58,982
You would have the family's support

712
00:34:58,992 --> 00:35:00,825
to step in and take the reins.

713
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,149
That's a very generous offer,

714
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,023
but I'm going to have to decline.

715
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:08,649
Um...

716
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:11,524
Ok. Can, uh, can I ask why?

717
00:35:11,534 --> 00:35:15,357
Why I don't want the job
that makes your brain explode?

718
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:18,815
Ok, but, um, uh...

719
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,857
G-Gerri, excuse me,

720
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:22,732
but I... I've always thought of you...

721
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:25,190
And I mean this
in the best possible way...

722
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,441
As a stone-cold killer bitch.

723
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:31,534
Who says you don't know how to flirt?

724
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,200
Ok.

725
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:19,232
Hey. Can I get a moment alone
with you, do you think?

726
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:21,649
- I...
- Have you seen this?

727
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:23,566
I'm so sorry about your father.

728
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:25,898
Thank you. Would you give us a minute?

729
00:36:25,908 --> 00:36:27,982
Yeah.

730
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:29,908
- Thanks, Willa.
- Mm-hmm.

731
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:33,149
Tom, would you mind?

732
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,773
Oh, come on. I'm not the same as her.

733
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:39,357
Ken.

734
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:42,566
Vaulter's running a story about
how the company's in turmoil.

735
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:44,315
Don't we own him?

736
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:46,566
"Shit show at the fuck factory"?

737
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:47,940
Yeah. Uncertainty, discord.

738
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,732
That is not a good story.

739
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:52,524
"Family gets behind
other member of family,"

740
00:36:52,534 --> 00:36:53,691
that's a good story.

741
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:55,232
Oh, fuck them.

742
00:36:55,242 --> 00:36:57,857
I mean, when jobs was dying,
apple didn't say anything.

743
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:00,190
We're in a hospital, shiv.
Everyone knows.

744
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,607
We can't just prop him up
and wave his hand

745
00:37:02,617 --> 00:37:04,442
and say he's fine like they did

746
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:06,486
in the politburo or weekend
at fuckin' Bernie's.

747
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:08,815
I like the sound of that, though.

748
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:10,190
Look,

749
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,274
you can't put a value on a human life,

750
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:16,315
except in our case,
you rather precisely can

751
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:19,232
because when trading opens tomorrow,
we're gonna drop like a stone.

752
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:21,492
The only question is, what's the bottom?

753
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,117
I think I'm the best option.

754
00:37:28,701 --> 00:37:31,149
I just want to say that, uh,

755
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:34,566
if you need me to...
Go get sandwiches or coffee

756
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:38,815
or step up from regional parks
and run north America, I can,

757
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:41,190
and I will. And that's
just an offer on the table...

758
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,441
- Fuck off, Tom.
- Fuck you, Kendall.

759
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:46,149
- Don't talk to Tom like that.
- It's ok. It's fine.

760
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,399
I was about to be announced.

761
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:51,649
I mean, how can I not
be the logical choice?

762
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:54,441
Because you were about to be
announced, Ken, and then you weren't.

763
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:57,566
I mean, the only thing we know for
certain, like for absolute certain,

764
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,940
tonight, is that dad didn't
want you running the company.

765
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,649
So if there was a list of 7
billion people on this planet

766
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:05,566
that dad would choose to be boss,
we know you would be last.

767
00:38:05,576 --> 00:38:07,276
Dad fired you, man.

768
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,064
No, he did not fire me.

769
00:38:09,075 --> 00:38:11,023
He said it was just
gonna take a little longer.

770
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,023
But he said that to be nice.

771
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:15,190
What I think he meant to
say was that he wished

772
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:17,062
that mom gave birth to a can opener

773
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:19,940
because at least then
it would be useful.

774
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,190
You're a dick.

775
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,982
- That's...
- Too far?

776
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:25,149
Look, the board are offering this to me.

777
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:27,482
I don't actually need your backing.

778
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:29,566
You actually really, totally do.

779
00:38:29,576 --> 00:38:31,107
I think you do.

780
00:38:31,117 --> 00:38:33,857
Without it, after what dad did to you,

781
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:36,482
I mean, we could probably
take any appointment to court.

782
00:38:36,492 --> 00:38:38,482
Jesus, shiv, we're talking
about court now?

783
00:38:38,492 --> 00:38:40,190
Fuck you!

784
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,773
I didn't even want to talk
about this, remember?

785
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:45,524
What do you... what do
you have against me?

786
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:48,065
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

787
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,190
Oh, you want me to actually say?

788
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,732
- Yes, I do.
- You lack killer instinct,

789
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:55,399
you're wet, you're green,
you're intellectually insecure,

790
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:56,732
bullshit.

791
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:58,315
You're not emotionally strong enough,

792
00:38:58,325 --> 00:39:00,482
- you have addiction issues.
- That's enough!

793
00:39:00,499 --> 00:39:02,817
I don't think all that, I'm
just trying to be dad's voice.

794
00:39:02,828 --> 00:39:05,302
Bravo. It was an excellent impression.

795
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:07,486
I just want to say
I'm not getting involved.

796
00:39:07,497 --> 00:39:09,566
Good. But shiv's right.

797
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:11,649
I'm not saying I would make
a better ceo,

798
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:12,982
that's unsaid...

799
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:14,607
It's not unsaid when you say it.

800
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:16,649
No, I'm saying I'm not saying it,

801
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:18,190
so, in fact, it is unsaid.

802
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,898
Hey, pal, why don't you
go help Willa with her homework?

803
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:22,649
Ouch. Asshole.

804
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:25,107
Listen, why don't you decide everything.

805
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:26,940
I don't care. I just observe.

806
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,773
I'm a un white helmet. All right?

807
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,815
Guys...

808
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,315
Who else are you gonna get?

809
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,441
I think shiv would be great.

810
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:34,773
That's what I think.

811
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:36,441
Thanks, honey,

812
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:39,107
but... no way.

813
00:39:39,117 --> 00:39:41,566
I mean, she doesn't work in the company

814
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:43,073
and has no experience of the company

815
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:45,749
and the markets would freak, but
apart from that, I agree with you.

816
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,773
I mean, we have options.

817
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:49,691
Sure. You could all ask for morphine

818
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:53,649
so you can stay in your
painless fucking fantasy world

819
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:57,274
where the orchids dance
and the company is run

820
00:39:57,284 --> 00:39:59,783
by a magical fucking unicorn!

821
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:06,783
Fuck your options.

822
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:22,857
Hello, this is Greg on Greg's phone.

823
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:24,566
- Greg. How ya doin'?
- Yeah, I'm just, um,

824
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,864
not dawdling.

825
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,441
You're still at the fucking apartment?
You've been there forever.

826
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:29,898
Uh, just, um...

827
00:40:29,908 --> 00:40:32,232
I know you're picking up
pjs and all that shit,

828
00:40:32,242 --> 00:40:36,149
just grab a sweater,
maybe, also. My dad's, ok?

829
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,898
- Ok. Which sweater?
- It doesn't matter.

830
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:41,691
Not something washed.
Something that he's worn, maybe.

831
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:43,010
- If you find one.
- Ok, yeah.

832
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:44,731
If he's worn it, if his...

833
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,149
How am I gonna know if it's worn?

834
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,691
Just smell it. Ok?

835
00:40:47,701 --> 00:40:49,982
Jesus! I just want something
that smells like him, ok?

836
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:51,713
I just want that.
Is that enough for you?

837
00:40:51,724 --> 00:40:52,898
Dude, that's really nice.

838
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:56,190
I would want that
if this was my situation, too.

839
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,441
So I'll sniff some stuff for you...

840
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:00,773
Just... whatever. And if you
tell anyone about this,

841
00:41:00,783 --> 00:41:02,357
I will... cut your dick off.

842
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,524
And don't forget those papers
I told you to bring.

843
00:41:04,534 --> 00:41:05,691
And, uh, thank you.

844
00:41:05,701 --> 00:41:06,716
Fuck off.

845
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:09,701
Yeah.

846
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:33,200
I... apologize if my bell summoned you.

847
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:40,566
Hey.

848
00:41:40,576 --> 00:41:41,857
Hey.

849
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,732
It's, um...

850
00:41:43,742 --> 00:41:46,023
- It's like 4:00 A.M.
- yeah, I couldn't sleep.

851
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:49,607
Put the kids to bed and thought
I was missing all the fun, so...

852
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:50,940
How are they doing?

853
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,773
- The kids?
- Yeah.

854
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:55,898
Um...

855
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:57,576
They're ok.

856
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:04,898
Maybe you could bring them by tomorrow.

857
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:10,274
So they can say their...
You know, say their... hellos.

858
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:11,783
- Yeah.
- Ok.

859
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:16,524
How are you feeling?

860
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,617
Good. Yeah.

861
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:22,607
Yeah. How am I feeling?

862
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:24,982
Fuck. Ask me another?

863
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:29,149
- Jesus, what a day for you.
- Yeah.

864
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,940
The nominating committee
want me to be the big boss.

865
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,898
Really?

866
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:39,357
But shiv and Roman won't back me

867
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:41,107
because of what dad said at lunch.

868
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:43,773
Jesus.

869
00:42:43,783 --> 00:42:47,149
- Yeah.
- Ah, your family is so...

870
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:48,315
Fucked.

871
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,867
I'm sorry, but... wow.

872
00:43:00,242 --> 00:43:01,659
I'm sorry.

873
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:18,992
Um...

874
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:23,659
Ken, I...

875
00:43:25,242 --> 00:43:28,149
What can I say? It's... I don't know.

876
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:29,659
Adrenaline.

877
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,524
It's just my body.

878
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:35,107
Hey.

879
00:43:35,117 --> 00:43:36,815
I'm glad you're here.

880
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:39,367
Yeah. I can tell.

881
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:58,815
- Hey. Look. Stop. Stop.
- No. I'm not in the mood.

882
00:43:58,825 --> 00:44:00,649
There's something I have to say to you.

883
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:02,857
- What?
- Siobhan Roy...

884
00:44:02,867 --> 00:44:04,691
Oh, my god.

885
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:05,857
Will you marry me?

886
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:09,065
What... the fuck? Seriously?

887
00:44:09,075 --> 00:44:11,023
I love you.

888
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:13,566
And I wanted to do something
to make all this better.

889
00:44:13,576 --> 00:44:15,912
And I thought while your
dad's still with us,

890
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:17,357
wouldn't that be a nice thing?

891
00:44:17,576 --> 00:44:19,065
We can get a quick wedding.

892
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:22,190
What is it about my dad dying
in a sterile environment

893
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,075
that screams big
romantic gesture to you?

894
00:44:27,075 --> 00:44:29,232
Well, it's a horrible day, I thought...

895
00:44:29,242 --> 00:44:31,190
Thought it would be a nice... thing.

896
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,898
Tom, you can't balance it out like that.

897
00:44:32,908 --> 00:44:37,274
I'm not gonna... give you a
blow job when your dog dies.

898
00:44:37,284 --> 00:44:38,783
Right?

899
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:43,607
Yeah. Ok.

900
00:44:43,617 --> 00:44:46,482
It's fine. I misjudged it. I get it.

901
00:44:46,492 --> 00:44:49,649
No, I'm s-sorry. Honey, I'm sorry.

902
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:52,033
I'm... this is...

903
00:44:54,242 --> 00:44:56,524
Let's just not have this as the moment.

904
00:44:56,534 --> 00:44:59,107
Why don't you do this again
properly another time.

905
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:00,691
No! Exactly. This is not the moment.

906
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:03,232
This didn't happen. Abort. Abort, abort,

907
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,783
good. Ok.

908
00:45:09,783 --> 00:45:11,940
But so you know,

909
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:14,274
yeah, whatever.

910
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:15,898
- Yes? Yes?
- Yeah.

911
00:45:15,908 --> 00:45:17,274
When it happens, yes.

912
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:18,607
Yes? Yes!

913
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:26,825
- Really?
- Yeah. I...

914
00:45:29,117 --> 00:45:30,576
Yeah.

915
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,274
- It's such a shitshow.
- What is?

916
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:39,190
My family.

917
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,492
Our family.

918
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,284
- Our family.
- Yeah.

919
00:46:00,867 --> 00:46:02,659
Hey, hey, hey.

920
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,081
So I got the slippers.

921
00:46:06,092 --> 00:46:07,140
Thank you.

922
00:46:07,151 --> 00:46:08,607
Yeah, I finally found 'em.

923
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:10,492
Can you put them in there, please?

924
00:46:11,825 --> 00:46:13,117
Yeah.

925
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:32,566
So, you got the slippers.

926
00:46:33,908 --> 00:46:35,898
I guess that makes you prince charming.

927
00:46:35,908 --> 00:46:37,190
I guess so.

928
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,524
You saying you want to fuck marcia?

929
00:46:39,534 --> 00:46:44,190
What?! No. Wh-why would you say that?

930
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,649
That's what you just said.

931
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:46,857
No. It isn't.

932
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:48,315
You said you were prince charming.

933
00:46:48,325 --> 00:46:50,691
- No, you just said that.
- I'm kidding.

934
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:51,982
I'm kidding.

935
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:55,033
Ok.

936
00:46:56,992 --> 00:46:59,607
Do you know that, uh...

937
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:01,190
Do you know that he gave me a job?

938
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,441
What job?

939
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:04,649
- I don't know.
- Ok.

940
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:07,304
- Do you know when I start?
- No. Obviously I don't know.

941
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:08,687
- Why would I know?
- I don't know.

942
00:47:08,698 --> 00:47:11,296
I thought you might know 'cause
I thought everybody's talking

943
00:47:11,307 --> 00:47:13,065
and, like, might be talking about me?

944
00:47:13,075 --> 00:47:16,232
No, everybody was talking
about you this whole time.

945
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:19,242
Everyone was only talking
about you, cousin Greg.

946
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:23,023
I get it.

947
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,451
Hey. Hey.

948
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:30,107
When you, uh, figure all this out,

949
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:33,023
come in and see me. Ok?

950
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:35,441
And, uh, and I'll look after you.

951
00:47:35,451 --> 00:47:37,940
All right?

952
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:40,566
I'm serious. I will.

953
00:47:40,576 --> 00:47:43,315
- Sure.
- Thanks, man.

954
00:47:43,325 --> 00:47:44,325
That's ok.

955
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:48,982
All right, later.

956
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:49,992
Take it easy, Greg.

957
00:48:04,617 --> 00:48:06,576
Yo, come here for a second.

958
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:11,649
So, listen.

959
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:13,441
I've been thinking...

960
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:16,524
We got for it. Me and you.

961
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:19,274
Ceo and coo.

962
00:48:19,284 --> 00:48:21,566
- Oh.
- Me and my homey romey.

963
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:23,607
I thought I was a fuckhead.

964
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:26,107
Uh, dipshit, and you said that.

965
00:48:26,117 --> 00:48:28,399
You said I wasn't serious.

966
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:31,399
- Sorry. It's been a long day.
- Yeah.

967
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,274
But dude, seriously.

968
00:48:34,284 --> 00:48:35,982
Me and you, bro.

969
00:48:35,992 --> 00:48:37,815
Like, I could teach you.

970
00:48:37,825 --> 00:48:40,200
And you could, you know, teach me.

971
00:48:41,992 --> 00:48:43,524
And shiv?

972
00:48:43,534 --> 00:48:45,190
I mean, you know what shiv's like.

973
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,149
Ultimately she's a daddy's girl. Right?

974
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:50,190
I mean, she wants to play it safe.

975
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,617
We're the ones with the nuts
to fuckin' revolutionize.

976
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:58,566
Ok, I'm not uninterested.

977
00:48:58,576 --> 00:49:00,607
All right, then, let's fuckin' do it.

978
00:49:00,617 --> 00:49:04,190
Here's the thing. Gerri just
turned down the top job.

979
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,232
So does that mean something?

980
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:08,857
Are you fuckin' with me?

981
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:10,441
Nope.

982
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:12,190
Who asked Gerri?

983
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,857
It was broached.

984
00:49:14,867 --> 00:49:16,815
- It was broached?
- Yeah.

985
00:49:16,825 --> 00:49:19,023
By who? Did you broach?
You broached it, didn't you?

986
00:49:19,033 --> 00:49:23,033
Don't pin the broach on me,
ok? Everyone was broaching.

987
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:27,691
Just want to make sure
we trust each other.

988
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,867
Everything up front, ok?

989
00:49:31,075 --> 00:49:32,149
All right.

990
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,242
Ok.

991
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:36,149
Shake on it or something?

992
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:37,357
Official?

993
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:39,075
Oh. Ok.

994
00:49:51,742 --> 00:49:52,908
Hi.

995
00:50:03,576 --> 00:50:04,691
Oh, come on.

996
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,242
Hey. Hey, knock it off.

997
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:13,075
Thank you, Willa.

998
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:28,232
So, listen, I've asked Roman
to be acting coo...

999
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:30,982
- Actual coo.
- To my acting ceo.

1000
00:50:30,992 --> 00:50:33,399
- And you said?
- I said why not?

1001
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:35,399
- Snake.
- Sis, please,

1002
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:38,065
I'm trying to bring everyone
together here. I'm mediating.

1003
00:50:38,075 --> 00:50:40,065
- Well, I'm saying no.
- Me too.

1004
00:50:40,075 --> 00:50:42,107
I thought you were
a fucking white helmet.

1005
00:50:42,117 --> 00:50:45,940
Sometimes a peacekeeper has to go
shoot a maniac on the perimeter, ok?

1006
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,649
What the fuck? Why would you say
no to this and yes to Gerri?

1007
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:52,441
Gerri has been with the company
for 20 years. Dad trusts her.

1008
00:50:52,451 --> 00:50:54,399
She's older. She's wiser.
She's a mature person...

1009
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:55,732
Such as myself.

1010
00:50:55,742 --> 00:50:58,107
Uh-huh. Well, she doesn't want it.

1011
00:50:58,117 --> 00:51:00,441
Ok, so in my opinion,
we should find someone else.

1012
00:51:00,451 --> 00:51:02,357
- Temporary.
- Ok, like who?

1013
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:05,315
I don't know, someone neutral.

1014
00:51:05,325 --> 00:51:08,357
Eva or... American psycho, what...

1015
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:10,482
- Karl.
- Karl. Yeah.

1016
00:51:10,492 --> 00:51:11,982
And what if it isn't temporary,

1017
00:51:11,992 --> 00:51:14,098
what if he uses his position
to make it permanent?

1018
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:17,274
Because he wouldn't do that.
He's nice! He brought coffee.

1019
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:19,456
Oh, he brought coffee.

1020
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:21,960
Then we should definitely let him
take control of the company.

1021
00:51:21,971 --> 00:51:24,077
Dude, he's not gonna
take control of the company.

1022
00:51:24,088 --> 00:51:25,274
Look, it's a gamble.

1023
00:51:25,284 --> 00:51:28,190
It's either me and Roman
and us as a family,

1024
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,190
or it's Eva and Karl,

1025
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,107
or some fuckface suit from the
deep state of the company.

1026
00:51:34,117 --> 00:51:35,982
They could take the company
out of our hands,

1027
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:37,524
and we'd never get near it again.

1028
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:39,607
If dad wakes up, and he's frail,

1029
00:51:39,617 --> 00:51:41,107
and he's looking at the end game,

1030
00:51:41,117 --> 00:51:42,691
you want to be the one who tells him

1031
00:51:42,701 --> 00:51:45,357
his family business
isn't family-run anymore?

1032
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:47,649
I mean, maybe you
could get away with it...

1033
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:49,815
- You know, his favorite.
- Oh, fuck you.

1034
00:51:49,825 --> 00:51:51,482
But maybe you wouldn't stay his favorite

1035
00:51:51,492 --> 00:51:53,242
if you gave away the firm.

1036
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:57,867
Look, we need a statement by 6:30.

1037
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:02,232
So you just have to think...

1038
00:52:02,242 --> 00:52:04,857
Like, bullshit aside...

1039
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:09,367
Who do you think, really,
dad would prefer?

1040
00:52:48,325 --> 00:52:50,732
What's up, fam?

1041
00:52:50,742 --> 00:52:55,190
Oh. Yeah. Um... did you get the papers?

1042
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,607
- What?
- The pap...

1043
00:52:56,617 --> 00:52:59,065
The papers in the envelope?
I called you?

1044
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,982
Dude... oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

1045
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:03,482
So no, basically?

1046
00:53:03,492 --> 00:53:05,065
I was thinking about your dad,

1047
00:53:05,075 --> 00:53:07,232
- I was up there...
- Hey, don't worry about it.

1048
00:53:07,242 --> 00:53:08,908
My head was just messed up.

1049
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:24,992
Ok. We're gonna have to announce.
Where are we at?

1050
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,274
While dad is ill, the family proposes
that Kendall run the company

1051
00:53:33,284 --> 00:53:35,274
with Roman as coo.

1052
00:53:35,284 --> 00:53:38,107
I hereby concur.

1053
00:53:38,117 --> 00:53:39,732
Ok. Ok, uh..

1054
00:53:39,742 --> 00:53:41,815
I will let the committee know
the family's position,

1055
00:53:41,825 --> 00:53:45,315
and pending board approval,
we can announce.

1056
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:47,274
- Congratulations, Ken.
- Thanks, Gerri.

1057
00:53:47,284 --> 00:53:48,773
And Roman, congratulations.

1058
00:53:48,783 --> 00:53:50,107
This is all very exciting.

1059
00:53:50,117 --> 00:53:51,315
Difficult decision.

1060
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:52,940
For the record,

1061
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,492
I personally believe this
to be a total fucking disaster.

1062
00:53:56,825 --> 00:53:58,482
Ok, good.

1063
00:53:58,492 --> 00:54:01,023
Kendall, um, listen,

1064
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,315
we need to talk.

1065
00:54:02,325 --> 00:54:03,815
I'm sorry, I just need to...

1066
00:54:03,825 --> 00:54:05,940
I just need a conversation
with you in private.

1067
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,149
- What is this?
- Um...

1068
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,232
There's a few things you should know.

1069
00:54:11,242 --> 00:54:14,482
Um......

1070
00:54:14,492 --> 00:54:16,149
Ok, there's no way to put this nicely,

1071
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:18,982
so forgive me for stating it baldly,

1072
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:22,649
but, um, there's a huge debt problem.

1073
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,982
What are you... no.

1074
00:54:24,992 --> 00:54:27,232
- Yes. Three billion.
- No, there's not.

1075
00:54:27,242 --> 00:54:30,149
Fuck off. I'd know.

1076
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:31,607
No one knows.

1077
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:33,441
Well, me and frank.

1078
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:34,607
What about... dad?

1079
00:54:34,617 --> 00:54:36,023
Yeah, your dad.

1080
00:54:36,033 --> 00:54:37,524
Hence the debt.

1081
00:54:37,534 --> 00:54:39,649
Gerri, what the fuck is going on?

1082
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:40,732
Where did the money go?

1083
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:42,149
In 1985,

1084
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,732
Logan needed cash badly
for the expansion into parks,

1085
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:48,691
so he took out a loan through
the family holding company.

1086
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:50,691
He knew that besides frank,

1087
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:53,416
none of the other boards members
could see what was happening.

1088
00:54:53,427 --> 00:54:57,412
And then he added that loan to the
company's already considerable debt.

1089
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,524
Son of a bitch.

1090
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,413
Ok.

1091
00:55:03,576 --> 00:55:04,898
Ok.

1092
00:55:04,908 --> 00:55:06,773
We can deal.

1093
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:09,190
Yeah, but Kendall, the thing is,

1094
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,773
it's secured against waystar's stock...

1095
00:55:12,783 --> 00:55:15,023
And when the stock hits 130,

1096
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:17,731
they can pursue repayment in full.

1097
00:55:17,742 --> 00:55:20,065
Which, if they decided
to do that, would eviscerate us.

1098
00:55:20,075 --> 00:55:22,496
Yeah, but there's no precedent for that.
They'll never do that.

1099
00:55:22,507 --> 00:55:23,649
They'll renegotiate.

1100
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:26,399
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

1101
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:29,857
Well, you see, the banks know
that the man they invested in

1102
00:55:29,867 --> 00:55:32,566
can no longer function,
and as far as they're concerned,

1103
00:55:32,576 --> 00:55:35,409
you're just some kid with nice hair.

1104
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:40,075
You're making it quite fucking
difficult to savor this moment, Gerri.

1105
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:42,742
I'm sorry about that.

1106
00:55:44,451 --> 00:55:45,701
Don't jump.

1107
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:21,149
We had hoped to see a response by now,

1108
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:24,315
but what we do know is
that he's stable. So...

1109
00:56:24,325 --> 00:56:27,284
If you want to grab some sleep,
this is a good time.

1110
00:56:35,451 --> 00:56:37,441
Night, dad.

1111
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:39,075
See you soon.
