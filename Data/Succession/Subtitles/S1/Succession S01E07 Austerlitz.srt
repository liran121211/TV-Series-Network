1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:01,296
I can trust you, right?

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,329
No.

3
00:00:02,353 --> 00:00:03,353
Because, um,

4
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,687
we're calling a vote of
no confidence on my dad.

5
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:07,520
What the fuck...

6
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:10,413
You do this, you gotta look worst case.

7
00:00:10,437 --> 00:00:12,830
Lawrence, Ewan, Ilona, all in play.

8
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:14,329
One more makes us sure winners.

9
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:16,562
Three years ago you
were still in the nuthouse.

10
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:19,746
Dad, it's called rehab,
and I'm in recovery.

11
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,371
You should be working
for a winner like Gil,

12
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:24,329
with an exciting bastard like me.

13
00:00:24,353 --> 00:00:26,186
I tried playing with you, you broke.

14
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,580
I'd like us to be...

15
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:29,663
exclusive?

16
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:31,162
It's obviously the dream.

17
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:33,204
If you wanted, you could
live with me in New Mexico...

18
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:34,079
No.

19
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:35,186
Dad's not well.

20
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,395
- The only way he'll respect you is if you try to destroy him.
-

21
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:39,604
I love my father,

22
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,496
but he is currently
unfit to run this company

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,371
and I'm calling for a vote of no confidence

24
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:45,079
in him as CEO and chairman.

25
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:46,228
Bullshit. No.

26
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:47,936
All in favor?

27
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:50,413
You better be smelling
your fucking armpit, Romulus.

28
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:51,538
Against.

29
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:54,621
I'm chairman. Casting
vote. It's fucking over.

30
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:55,705
What's the vote?

31
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:58,562
My son, that was your best shot. You lost.

32
00:01:21,936 --> 00:01:23,729
Mr. Roy.

33
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:29,246
Hey, Logan Roy! Mind
if I get a quick photo?

34
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,580
I'm a big fan.
Step back.

35
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:32,580
Big, big fan.
I- I love your work.

36
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:35,580
I love everything you do. I
love all the racism, misogyny...

37
00:01:35,604 --> 00:01:36,912
Step off.

38
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,580
It's really cool stuff!
Security!

39
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:39,895
Logan, over here!

40
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:42,830
My fuckin' piss!

41
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:45,580
You're fuckin' monopolist scum!

42
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:48,746
Did it get in your eye?
I hope you die!

43
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,912
Can you open this up, please?

44
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:54,645
I want no one else in here.
All right, stay back.

45
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:01,246
Can we get another shirt down here?

46
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,520
We had an incident outside with Mr. Roy.

47
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,871
How many people do
you think pissed in that bag

48
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:23,954
to get all that piss?

49
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,705
I mean, it's just urine.

50
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,912
I'm good, I'm good.

51
00:02:26,936 --> 00:02:30,186
No fuss, no fuss, I'm good. OK?

52
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:34,830
Are you OK?
Fine.

53
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,996
Don't get all over me.

54
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,580
OK?
OK.

55
00:02:38,604 --> 00:02:41,162
These trust fund YouTube shits.

56
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:43,288
Ugh. God, we had a couple of these guys...

57
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:44,729
I'm here. OK?

58
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,037
Now, I understand

59
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:51,621
you want me to go through
my every thought with you.

60
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:54,162
I appreciate finally getting a chance

61
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:58,496
to talk through these very major
moves you're considering, yes.

62
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,996
We've become aware

63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,329
of some very desirable
assets that are available.

64
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:04,162
A block of local TV stations.

65
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:06,037
Highly undervalued.

66
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,912
Teevvvee...

67
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,788
Oh, I remember those.

68
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:11,788
We still have one of those in my gym.

69
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:15,580
Oh, it's so great to have
the wisdom of my son's

70
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:17,854
college drinking buddy in the room.

71
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:21,996
I just love the way he asks me for money.

72
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,413
No, I get it.

73
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,580
But there is a pressing issue, right?

74
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:29,912
Well, it's part of a larger strategy.

75
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:31,621
No, I- I get all that.

76
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,580
I'm just- All right.

77
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:37,204
I think the issue here, sir,

78
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:40,729
is that everyone fucking hates you.

79
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:44,788
It's cloudy, it's sunny.

80
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:47,288
You want to push through a massive

81
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:49,580
politically sensitive buy-up,

82
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,830
and I'm reading this over
my morning cappuccino.

83
00:03:52,854 --> 00:03:54,912
It says your family is a horror show

84
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:57,145
and it's destroying America.

85
00:03:58,562 --> 00:03:59,996
Hmm.

86
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,288
Maybe we should buy this.

87
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:04,788
Kendall launched a lawsuit against you.

88
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,912
You have fired half of your board.

89
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:09,746
Your COO is a fucking joke.
Whoa.

90
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,496
Bro, that's what people are
saying. Who cares if it's true?

91
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,329
People say that he's a coked-up dauphin

92
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:17,079
that doesn't know shit from Shinola,

93
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:18,912
and that the two of you aren't
even talking to each other,

94
00:04:18,936 --> 00:04:20,413
which I am getting a vibe of.

95
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:22,912
Now, I could care less,

96
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:25,871
but even the advance
whispers of this local TV deal

97
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:27,580
have people so mad at you

98
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:30,037
that they're throwing
piss at you on the street.

99
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,912
We don't know that it was actually piss.

100
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:33,204
It was piss.

101
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:34,663
You want to go on a shopping spree.

102
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,413
I trust you, but can we
please fix the visuals?

103
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:39,162
This is a family business.

104
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:41,454
But the family is fucked,

105
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:43,770
and it's hurting the stock.

106
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:22,454
Whenever war has tested this nation,

107
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:24,538
we have won out.

108
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:28,121
And that is what I
believe we face right now.

109
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:30,954
Nothing less than a war

110
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:33,121
against human inequality,

111
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:35,912
a war we must fight

112
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:40,371
to stop unimaginably vast power and riches

113
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:41,871
falling into the hands

114
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:44,121
of an impossibly small number of men.

115
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,580
I'm not afraid of this fight.

116
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,162
I know you're not either.

117
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:49,996
This fight starts here.

118
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,621
I'm Gil Eavis, and I approved this message.

119
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,580
I don't know, this class war shit,

120
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:58,454
don't you find it a little jejune?

121
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:00,954
Jejune?
Yeah. It means juvenile.

122
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:03,329
Yeah, I- I know what it means.

123
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:06,454
I just thought only assholes said it.

124
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,454
No, I do not find it jejune.
Is this you pulling my hair?

125
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,912
Because why did you bring
me in for this? I'm not a good fit.

126
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:16,663
I genuinely believe he's gonna be
the next president of the United States.

127
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,246
And you know me, I
don't believe in anything.

128
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,162
Are you finished with Joyce now?

129
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:24,079
Yeah. That's as far as she'll go.

130
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:26,770
OK. Gil could really use someone like you.

131
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,246
And this wouldn't be a problem?

132
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,871
What?

133
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:36,936
The atmosphere.

134
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:47,454
I think as long as we have clarity.

135
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:50,830
Yeah. Right. Clarity.
Right.

136
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:53,121
And to be clear,

137
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:56,496
at absolutely any place at any time,

138
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,788
with absolutely no consequences,

139
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,705
I would fuck you,

140
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,580
and will want desperately to fuck you.

141
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:06,562
And that is just a
permanent state of affairs.

142
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:10,830
I just want you to
know that is my position.

143
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:12,621
You have all the power.

144
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:14,812
You can do whatever you want with it.

145
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,996
When did we start having
to do this shit, Gerri?

146
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,830
The journalist is Leo Lorenzetti.

147
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:31,788
The piece will be, "After the
turmoil, the coming together."

148
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:32,996
At your son's ranch.

149
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,413
A family, a dynasty,

150
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:35,705
an American story.

151
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,621
It'll be a very compelling package.

152
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,413
And what's this shit? Who's this guy Alon?

153
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,496
Very highly regarded corporate therapist.

154
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,996
Harvard Business School.

155
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,204
Former CFO at a Fortune 500.

156
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:47,121
He just worked with the Sultan of Brunei,

157
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:48,580
and the Bolkiah family.

158
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:50,496
Do they all have to be there?

159
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,645
Does the traitor come too?

160
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:56,329
Well, obviously, that's your choice.

161
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,912
But the message, I think,

162
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:01,871
is a family reunited in the desert.

163
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:03,871
A time to reflect, regroup.

164
00:09:03,895 --> 00:09:06,204
Family unity is kind of
what you're going for.

165
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:08,246
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And frankly, Logan,

166
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,496
if you can get Kendall to drop the lawsuit,

167
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,830
everything becomes cleaner
for us, acquisition-wise.

168
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,204
OK. Well, I'm not groveling.

169
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:18,121
Get Romulus on the phone.

170
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:20,395
Let's do the email.

171
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:38,746
Hey, Shiv.

172
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,371
It's Con. Listen, did you
get this email from Dad

173
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,037
about therapy?

174
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:45,788
'Cause, I mean,

175
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:48,329
this is, like, wow!

176
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:50,705
So I just need to check that it's not

177
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:52,912
one of those spam things or something.

178
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:54,413
All right, so call me.

179
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:56,871
I like Gil - people like Gil, he's great...

180
00:09:56,895 --> 00:10:00,079
But I have a sneaking feeling
that if he won an election

181
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:03,246
he'd probably like to line me up
and everyone I know and shoot us.

182
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,246
Holy fuck. No way.
What?

183
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,978
Hang on.

184
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:12,812
Hmm.

185
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:15,912
Hey.
Have you seen this?

186
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:17,580
I can't believe it. Dad's doing therapy?

187
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:19,162
I thought you weren't talking to me because

188
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,121
I didn't tell you about the vote.

189
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:22,371
I'm not. But what the fuck.

190
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:23,621
Oh! Very much the fuck.

191
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:25,329
Very much the fuck indeed.

192
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:28,246
The big man is breakin'
down, and everyone's invited.

193
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,454
Well, not Kendall.

194
00:10:29,478 --> 00:10:31,121
Everybody.
This is bullshit.

195
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:32,663
What's he doing?

196
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,312
Gotta go. See ya.
Please, Mr. Roy...

197
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:37,788
I need to talk to Kendall.
He's not available.

198
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:39,288
What do you mean he's not available?

199
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:41,663
What is he doing, playing
with his fucking Legos?

200
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:43,079
He's nothing but available.

201
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:44,454
He isn't here right now.

202
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,496
Well, I know that's not true,

203
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,871
so just come on, OK?

204
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,496
He hasn't been here for weeks.

205
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,246
I'm sorry.
Bullshit. OK, look,

206
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,538
will you just give him a message?

207
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:53,162
No, thank you.
Tell him...

208
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,288
"No, thank you"...

209
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:55,663
Tell him to reply to the email,

210
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,121
that he has to come. OK?

211
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:58,246
Tell him that...

212
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,812
Hey. Dad wants...

213
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,830
Hey. Um, no.

214
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:14,912
No, I don't think he's gonna play ball.

215
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:17,663
He's not talking. No way
he's gonna drop the lawsuit.

216
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:18,854
OK, that's fine, Roman.

217
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:23,186
No?
No.

218
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:27,329
OK. Plan B.

219
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,687
Operation Black Sheep.

220
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:05,562
Hey.
Hey. You OK?

221
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:10,162
Yeah, I'm fine. What's up?

222
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:12,413
Oh, what time are we doing the pickup?

223
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:14,329
Do you ever look at Sophie's Instagram?

224
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,413
I was monitoring,

225
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:19,538
and one of the older kids linked
to that shitty article about you.

226
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:21,103
What article?

227
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:26,371
I haven't been looking at
anything. Deliberately, Rava.

228
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:29,162
"Kendall Roy ran the streets of New York,"

229
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:30,830
sweaty and incoherent,

230
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:33,037
ranting about a coup against his father,

231
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:36,037
but couldn't find his way to the
board room to start said coup.

232
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:37,454
Is he back on drugs?

233
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:38,954
We couldn't possibly say,

234
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:41,746
"but some people are saying that."

235
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,996
Rava, listen to me.

236
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,538
OK, that's- That's not true.

237
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:47,288
Yeah.
OK? That's not true.

238
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:49,954
Mm-hmm. It's just that's
what you used to say

239
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,079
when it was true.

240
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,246
Jesus, I'm not using, Rava.

241
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,079
I- I don't touch anything.

242
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:57,079
And you know that. Jesus Christ. Come on.

243
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:58,912
But look, unrelated,

244
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:01,621
this weekend Iverson's got his tests

245
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,580
and if we break his routine,
it's gonna affect things.

246
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:06,580
You know?
No. No.

247
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:08,288
Fuck, come on.

248
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:10,454
Please don't get angry.

249
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:12,663
I'm not- I'm not fucking angry.

250
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:14,246
OK? I want to see my kids.

251
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,204
I'm not on drugs, I'm not touching drugs,

252
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:19,246
I don't use drugs
anymore, I'm not on drugs,

253
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,954
I'm not on fucking drugs.

254
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:23,645
Yeah, it's the paranoid
rant that's so convincing.

255
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,871
Well, I actually think

256
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,746
it's really brave to go.

257
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,538
Oh, thank you. I'm a hero.

258
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:39,204
Hmm.
Ugh.

259
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:40,954
Can you imagine?

260
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:43,162
Connor, Dad, Roman, feelings?

261
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:45,954
It's gonna be like tossing a bag
of Uzis into the soft play area.

262
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:47,413
I know your dad doesn't believe

263
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:49,413
you didn't know what Kendall was up to,

264
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,788
and he spoke abominably to you.

265
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:54,454
And, um, just for context,

266
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:56,830
do you think it would be
appropriate this weekend,

267
00:13:56,854 --> 00:13:58,371
in a bridge-building way,

268
00:13:58,395 --> 00:13:59,954
for me to be speaking to Logan, or no?

269
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:02,996
Just do what you think is right.

270
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,288
Yeah, sure. I got it. I just, you know,

271
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,371
I want to have your back,

272
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:10,996
and, uh, there's also my back,

273
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,329
and, you know, we're
a beast with two backs.

274
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,663
I get it. You're your own guy.

275
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,830
I won't judge you.

276
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:20,020
Yeah, sure, I know that. I know that.

277
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:50,812
Hi!
Hey, Marcia!

278
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:54,705
Hi!
Hey, Dad!

279
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,037
Welcome to Austerlitz!

280
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,746
Thank you, thank you.

281
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,912
Ah. It exists!
Yeah.

282
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:04,871
Austerlitz? Was this the
name when you bought it?

283
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:07,121
Oh, it was racially insensitive,

284
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:08,496
so he picked a new one.

285
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,830
Do you want me to show you inside?

286
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:13,079
Hi, Connor.

287
00:15:13,103 --> 00:15:14,580
Hi, Karolina.

288
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:17,830
So, son, have you got
somewhere for them to set up?

289
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:19,621
So you're also working?

290
00:15:19,645 --> 00:15:23,079
Just a few folks doing
photographs and stuff.

291
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:25,936
Oh? Uh...
Chroniclers of everything.

292
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:28,788
OK.

293
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:30,746
OK. You bet.

294
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,288
Great place. Plenty of space.
Yeah.

295
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:36,121
This works.

296
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:37,270
Oh, good.

297
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:46,912
Hey! I see you!

298
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:48,454
Hey!
Hey!

299
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:49,538
Hi!

300
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:51,746
Hello to the metropolitan elite!

301
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,538
Welcome to the real America.

302
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:55,121
Oh, man of the people.

303
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:56,954
The people who work on his ranch.

304
00:15:56,978 --> 00:15:58,830
Hi!
Let me hug you.

305
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:01,621
What do you think?

306
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,079
Wow. Yeah.

307
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:04,788
It's brown.
Yeah, it is.

308
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:07,329
Is that a church?
Yeah, that's the chapel.

309
00:16:07,353 --> 00:16:09,204
We're gonna be in there tomorrow.

310
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:10,371
That chapel dates to 1878.

311
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:12,288
Cool!
It's a chapel.

312
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:14,538
Do you think Dad will be
able to cross the threshold?

313
00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:16,246
Or will be spontaneously combust?

314
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,413
Good question.

315
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:18,996
Why don't you guys get settled in,

316
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,454
and then join us for
cocktails this evening.

317
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:23,871
Randall owns the next ranch over.

318
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,454
I told him to pop in.
Just wanted to say hi.

319
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:28,079
He's very big in pesticides.

320
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:30,329
Uh-huh. I don't need any.

321
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:34,329
Ho! Yeah, that's what everybody says.

322
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:36,079
Nah, I'm always ribbing him.

323
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:39,079
Did you know that three out of
every hundred bunches of grapes

324
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:41,329
has over the legal limit of pesticides?

325
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:42,663
So you wash 'em.

326
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:45,496
You can't wash your colon, Mr. Poison.

327
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,329
Why, I oughta...

328
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:48,663
Smart guy, put 'em up!

329
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:51,121
He thinks she knew about the coup.

330
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:54,371
So Logan will talk to Shiv
as long as she says "sorry."

331
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:57,288
Well, I think that Shiv's position would be

332
00:16:57,312 --> 00:16:59,246
that she's got nothing to be sorry for.

333
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,329
I mean, obviously she's sad,

334
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:04,496
you know, there's sadness.

335
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,895
We could offer that.

336
00:17:23,312 --> 00:17:26,912
OK. The entertainment has arrived.

337
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:30,912
This is like a- like the
first stages of an orgy.

338
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:33,912
Kind of exciting, but also super-awkward.

339
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:36,246
There. I did it.
Did what?

340
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,079
I just iced your dad.

341
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:40,079
Hey, Tom.
Hey.

342
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:41,371
Can I...

343
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:44,204
Uh, yeah, I'm not in charge of you.

344
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:46,329
But go get me a drink.

345
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:48,520
I'm joking.

346
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:54,705
So where's the actual head doctor guy?

347
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:57,037
I wouldn't know. No one tells me anything.

348
00:17:57,061 --> 00:18:01,288
Well, hope he can cure your
serious case of being a bitch.

349
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:02,413
Ow. Fuck.

350
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:04,413
Fuck you.

351
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:05,978
Fuck you.

352
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,454
Bet Dad's gonna try and win at therapy.

353
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:12,162
Well, he hasn't done therapy
with me yet. I'm an expert.

354
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:14,246
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.

355
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,496
This is what it looks like when
you resolve all your issues.

356
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,954
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.

357
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:21,204
My guy says that if Dad had had therapy,

358
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:22,746
I wouldn't need so much.

359
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,454
My guy's surprised I got through at all.

360
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,121
I'm not sure you did
make it through at all.

361
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:29,621
I don't think... dee-dee,
dah-doo, bah-dee...

362
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:31,912
See, I will have you know
I am very well-adjusted.

363
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:34,580
You... you're just good at hiding it.

364
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:37,121
Mr. Parfit is here.
Thank you.

365
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:38,746
OK, Randall,

366
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,121
I hate to kick you out,

367
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:42,371
but I have word Elvis is in the building.

368
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:43,954
OK.
I'll see ya, buddy.

369
00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:46,121
I just want you to know

370
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:47,912
I think I'm going to reveal to him

371
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:49,746
that you sexually abused me as a child.

372
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,621
Excuse me?
Yeah. You just would not stop.

373
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:54,037
You are one sick puppy.

374
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:56,288
You're the one who kept trying to fuck me.

375
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:57,621
Why would you say that? Stop saying that.

376
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:58,830
You don't really think that, do you?

377
00:18:58,854 --> 00:19:00,538
No. I'm fuckin' with you.

378
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:02,621
The way you fucked me as a baby.

379
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,329
What is wrong with
you? You're exasperating.

380
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,371
This one is threatening to tell the family

381
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,663
that I diddled him
when he was a little kid.

382
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:12,121
Oh. Right. Did you?

383
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:13,770
No, of course not, Tom.

384
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,162
Connor.
Oh. Hi.

385
00:19:17,186 --> 00:19:18,288
Alon Parfit.

386
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:19,788
Hey. Hi.
Nice to see you.

387
00:19:19,812 --> 00:19:21,705
Happy you're here.
You must be Broman.

388
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:23,162
Yes, I am. Broman.

389
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:24,580
And Shiv.
Yeah.

390
00:19:24,604 --> 00:19:26,705
Hey. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you...?

391
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:28,496
This is Tom. Shiv's fiancé.

392
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,663
Not important. To the therapy.

393
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,830
Uh, Con?
Come meet Dad.

394
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:34,246
Yeah, please.

395
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,871
Hi.
Logan Roy.

396
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:38,996
This is Marcia.
Nice to meet you.

397
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,496
And this is my girlfriend Willa.

398
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,663
Nice to meet you. Hi, Willa, how are you?

399
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:46,621
Right. Family. Um...

400
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,204
we're all gathered here
in this beautiful home

401
00:19:49,228 --> 00:19:51,538
because there are things to address,

402
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:55,413
and I believe we should... address them.

403
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:58,371
I think I explained all around

404
00:19:58,395 --> 00:19:59,830
that we'll also have

405
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:02,830
a small celebration of our coming together,

406
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:04,663
with photographs, tomorrow.

407
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:07,121
Nothing fancy. Simple. Simple.

408
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:11,746
Anyway, without more
ado, let me introduce to you,

409
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,270
Alon Parfit.

410
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,037
Hi, everyone.

411
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:19,413
I look forward to us all
sitting down tomorrow,

412
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:22,871
but I just want to say it
takes a lot of courage,

413
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:25,538
and that is not lost on me.

414
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:27,246
Uh...

415
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,830
I'm very touched.

416
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,871
Yeah, me too.
Thanks.

417
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:34,162
This family's broken, and
that has consequences.

418
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:35,912
A missed phone call today,

419
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:39,204
a couple dozen kids
lose their jobs in China.

420
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:41,912
Butterfly wings, but bigger.

421
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:44,204
Huge wings. Like a pterodactyl.

422
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:45,371
Or the Smithsonian.

423
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:48,204
So... let's fix our wings.

424
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:50,621
Barely comprehensible.

425
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:51,830
Morning.

426
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:53,246
It is gassed up and ready to go.

427
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,954
Your key.
Thank you.

428
00:20:54,978 --> 00:20:56,454
Big plans while you're here?

429
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:57,580
Maybe.

430
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:00,746
Patricide? Fratricide?

431
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,371
OK. Sounds like fun.

432
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,936
Enjoy.
Oh, yeah.

433
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:25,162
Yeah?
Good morning.

434
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:26,871
We're here. You ready to do this?

435
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:28,121
What?

436
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:30,621
No, wait. Now?
No shit.

437
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:32,288
I'm in a hotel in Santa Fe.

438
00:21:32,312 --> 00:21:35,621
Well, I c-can't now.

439
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:38,538
I mean, the whole reason I came
down here is to do this family thing,

440
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:41,079
and that's today. So...

441
00:21:41,103 --> 00:21:43,121
So?

442
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:44,621
Can he reschedule?

443
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:46,496
He's pretty fuckin' busy.

444
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,580
Ahh. Oh, fuck.

445
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:51,121
Doesn't look good, turning him down.

446
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:52,705
Well, obviously I want to...

447
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,830
Come on, Shiv, this is huge.

448
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:57,621
But I can't. Right now.
Hey, honey,

449
00:21:57,645 --> 00:22:00,538
the pressure on the faucet's
moderately intense, so go easy.

450
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,788
I gotta go.
Shiv...

451
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:04,621
Fuck.

452
00:22:04,645 --> 00:22:06,830
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

453
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:09,413
Hey, it's gonna be OK.

454
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:11,204
It's going to be OK.

455
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:13,037
Want me to come in there with you?

456
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:15,912
Into the emotional swamp? Huh?

457
00:22:15,936 --> 00:22:18,895
Pretty soon I'm gonna be part
of this whole genetic carnival.

458
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:23,996
It's OK.
You sure?

459
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,020
Yeah.

460
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,162
Morning.

461
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:33,037
OK. Let's do this.

462
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,061
The therapy? This way for the therapy.

463
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:42,604
Whoo.

464
00:22:49,854 --> 00:22:51,746
Like waving your kids off to school.

465
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,912
They better not gang up on him.

466
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:56,395
He's still frail.

467
00:22:58,312 --> 00:23:00,413
Roll up, roll up,

468
00:23:00,437 --> 00:23:02,705
for the festival of grievances.

469
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:07,079
OK, son? Good.
Yeah.

470
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:09,037
OK. Great.

471
00:23:09,061 --> 00:23:10,954
So, welcome, welcome.

472
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:13,037
I like to begin these things

473
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:14,912
with a little prayer.

474
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:18,454
Uh, they fuck you up, your mom and dad.

475
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:22,788
They do not mean to, but they do.

476
00:23:22,812 --> 00:23:25,329
They fill you up with faults they had

477
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:27,830
and add some extra just for you.

478
00:23:27,854 --> 00:23:30,788
Now, I always think
that's an interesting way

479
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:32,496
to start these things,

480
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,788
but what I'd like to know is,

481
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:37,954
how you feel you would like to start this.

482
00:23:37,978 --> 00:23:41,162
So...

483
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,936
who's going to tell us
why we are here today?

484
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:57,562
Come on. Does no one want
to take a pop at the champ?

485
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:02,621
Can I just say... Sure.

486
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:04,580
I never touched Roman inappropriately.

487
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:06,538
If he says I did, I didn't.

488
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:08,413
Glad to clear that up.

489
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:11,329
He was gonna make a
horrible joke, so I'm preempting.

490
00:24:11,353 --> 00:24:12,454
OK. OK.

491
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:14,454
But I think the best way to start this...

492
00:24:14,478 --> 00:24:17,121
Uh. I'll start if you'd like.

493
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:19,288
Yeah, Please.

494
00:24:19,312 --> 00:24:22,538
Um... everything I've done in my life,

495
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,162
I've done for my children.

496
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:28,121
I know I've made mistakes,

497
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,621
but, um,

498
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:33,204
I've always tried to do the best by them...

499
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:37,478
because... they mean everything to me.

500
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:45,288
OK. That was great.

501
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,371
Thank you.

502
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:50,538
Well, that's nice.
It is nice.

503
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:52,788
Yeah, sure. Agreed.

504
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:55,454
So, what do we feel about
what we just heard here?

505
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:58,037
I mean, I hear it.

506
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,353
I hear it.

507
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:03,204
Uh-huh. Big words.

508
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:04,353
Good words.

509
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,162
Oh. I'm still... processing,

510
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:12,912
but yeah.

511
00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:16,580
Logan, do you realize how much
power you wield in this room?

512
00:25:16,604 --> 00:25:17,788
What do you mean?

513
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:19,145
He has a lot of power everywhere.

514
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,912
What I guess I'm asking is,

515
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,871
how do you feel about what you just said?

516
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:27,830
Look, everything I've done in my life

517
00:25:27,854 --> 00:25:29,663
I've done for my children.

518
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:31,162
I know I've made mistakes...
Uh, Dad,

519
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:32,621
you can't just use the one sentence.

520
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:34,496
But that's how I feel, Siobhan.

521
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,413
I can make this shit up if you like.

522
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:38,204
Sounds like you already are.

523
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:41,604
Shiv?
Look, I'm...

524
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,746
I guess where I'm coming from is

525
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,830
I'm having a hard time diving in because

526
00:25:46,854 --> 00:25:50,121
honestly, I'm wondering why he
brought us here in the first place.

527
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:51,454
I mean, was it for this photo opportunity?

528
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:53,329
No, no, of course not.

529
00:25:53,353 --> 00:25:56,413
I wouldn't have brought you
here for a photo and an interview...

530
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:58,538
Sorry. Excuse me? There's an interview now?

531
00:25:58,562 --> 00:26:01,204
Well, I told you, photo and...
No, you didn't.

532
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,663
What, so this is
essentially a publicity event?

533
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,246
It's optional. There won't be questions.

534
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,454
This is not OK.

535
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:09,705
I have a publicist for this stuff.

536
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:12,079
Fuck. Con, did you know about this?

537
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,746
I think the picture is OK.

538
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,912
I think it's nice.

539
00:26:14,936 --> 00:26:16,437
Rome?

540
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:18,687
I don't mind.

541
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:23,788
Logan, have you thought
about the possibility

542
00:26:23,812 --> 00:26:26,454
that your children are
actually scared of you?

543
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:28,329
Aw, fuck off.

544
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,437
After what they've done to me? Fuck off!

545
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:34,871
Tell me, do you think

546
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:36,996
you'll always do what you do?

547
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,246
What, the theater?

548
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,371
Yes, and what you do for money.

549
00:26:41,395 --> 00:26:42,871
Uh-huh.

550
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:45,413
Uh, well, you know, I like my life,

551
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,413
and kind of just go with the flow,

552
00:26:48,437 --> 00:26:52,663
so yeah, I think I'll just slide more over

553
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:55,871
into producing or writing or directing.

554
00:26:55,895 --> 00:26:59,538
I knew a woman in
Paris, she did what you do.

555
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:01,454
She was very intelligent.

556
00:27:01,478 --> 00:27:03,454
Oh, thank you.

557
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:05,912
And do you want children?

558
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:09,538
Um, I don't know. Maybe one day.

559
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,788
Don't wait. That's all I will say.

560
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:14,037
The old biological clock starts a-ticking.

561
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:15,413
You could always freeze.

562
00:27:15,437 --> 00:27:17,788
That's a way of putting off life.

563
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:20,621
I'd like Shiv to freeze. Embryos, not eggs.

564
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:22,037
A little bit of me in the bank.

565
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:23,830
Thought about that?

566
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:26,454
Ahh, so much advice! Wow!

567
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,788
You know, my friend from
Paris who was your way?

568
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:31,812
She actually was murdered.

569
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:36,912
It was nothing to do
with her being a prostitute,

570
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:39,478
it was to do with a
restaurant that went poof!

571
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:42,645
What?

572
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:13,705
Hey, do you have any non-alcoholic beer?

573
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:15,746
No. Sorry.

574
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,871
OK. How about sparkling water?

575
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:19,954
Mm-hmm.

576
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:21,954
You a tourist?

577
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:24,288
Uh, kind of.

578
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:25,687
Hmm.

579
00:28:28,895 --> 00:28:30,621
Oh. Fancy.

580
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:32,371
Kendall Roy?

581
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:34,437
You here visiting family?

582
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,079
Connor Roy?

583
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:39,621
What?

584
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:41,954
No, it's OK, I probably think the same.

585
00:28:41,978 --> 00:28:44,830
Yeah. There's just stories.
Like?

586
00:28:44,854 --> 00:28:46,871
Like, he came in here one night,

587
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:49,871
he had this dog with cancer
that he couldn't let the vet kill

588
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,413
but he couldn't watch it die either,

589
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:53,538
so he dragged that thing
around the whole bar

590
00:28:53,562 --> 00:28:55,954
asking somebody if they'd
take it and give it a good life.

591
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,562
He said, "I'll pay you.
I just can't watch."

592
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:03,496
Anyway, Skunkhead Tanner over there

593
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,037
took three grand, shot
her in the parking lot.

594
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:07,246
Jesus.

595
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,871
What?
None of your business.

596
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:10,246
I was talking about Skunkhead.

597
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,454
Don't talk shit
about me, Janelle.

598
00:29:12,478 --> 00:29:14,371
Oh, really?

599
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:17,936
Hey, also, can I get a
double Smirnoff rocks?

600
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,936
Lime?
No.

601
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:50,228
Keep it open.

602
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,413
Heard you killed my brother's dog.

603
00:29:54,437 --> 00:29:56,329
Look, can we go back to our agreement

604
00:29:56,353 --> 00:29:57,830
where we put aside our cell phones,

605
00:29:57,854 --> 00:30:00,329
just focus on what's going on this room?

606
00:30:00,353 --> 00:30:01,871
Can we do that?

607
00:30:01,895 --> 00:30:04,996
I'm trying to buy a number
of television stations.

608
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,312
OK, but could you do it later?

609
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,371
Fine. Tell me what more you
want and I'll dance the dance.

610
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:20,121
I guess what I want is for you to tell us

611
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:21,371
how you are feeling?

612
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:23,121
How I'm feeling?
Mm-hmm.

613
00:30:23,145 --> 00:30:25,996
I feel...

614
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,663
I need to check my emails.

615
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:29,413
That's not a feeling, Dad.

616
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:31,954
Maybe don't deny Dad's feelings, Shiv.

617
00:30:31,978 --> 00:30:34,830
I turned down something huge to
be here, and you're gonna tank it.

618
00:30:34,854 --> 00:30:36,996
I'm doing therapy.
I don't think you are.

619
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,162
I am.

620
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:39,788
Now you're denying their feelings, Dad.

621
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:42,996
Look, what I think we should
really have a conversation about

622
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,329
is the fact that Kendall's not here.

623
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:47,996
And that's because there are reports of him

624
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,830
running around taking drugs.

625
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:52,329
And I, for one, don't know
where those have come from.

626
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:53,496
You don't have to worry about that.

627
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,454
What does that mean?

628
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,830
I'm not getting into that
today. It's beyond the remit.

629
00:30:57,854 --> 00:30:59,996
I don't really think there is a remit, Dad.

630
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,288
I had nothin' to do with those stories.

631
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:05,353
Shiv, do you believe your father?

632
00:31:10,395 --> 00:31:12,830
Well...
Go on.

633
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:14,413
Honestly, no.

634
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:16,353
I think this whole thing is fake.

635
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:19,621
Roman?

636
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,270
I don't know.

637
00:31:23,312 --> 00:31:24,854
I don't know.

638
00:31:26,395 --> 00:31:28,538
No.
I mean,

639
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:31,413
he might not have meant to, but...

640
00:31:31,437 --> 00:31:34,288
no, I don't believe him.
I'm sorry!

641
00:31:34,312 --> 00:31:35,413
I'm sorry!

642
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:36,538
All right?!

643
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,037
I'm finished.

644
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:41,371
I'll apologize as much as you fuckin' like,

645
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:43,496
but I can't get into everything.

646
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,228
That's it.

647
00:31:50,186 --> 00:31:52,204
You know, Logan,

648
00:31:52,228 --> 00:31:56,413
if I'm asked if I thought that you
participated in this family therapy

649
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:58,871
in an earnest way,

650
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:01,538
I don't think that I could
answer in good conscience

651
00:32:01,562 --> 00:32:03,037
that you have.

652
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:06,121
Fine. I apologize.

653
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:07,705
Maybe I'm hungry.

654
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:09,061
I got nothin' to hide.

655
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:12,663
OK.

656
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:14,413
How about we take a break

657
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:17,079
and begin again, clean
slate, this afternoon?

658
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,103
Hmm?

659
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,496
So come on, come on, tell me.

660
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,663
What did everybody say in there? Huh?

661
00:32:25,687 --> 00:32:28,746
Was it nothing too horrible or upsetting?

662
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,413
Was it just disgusting?

663
00:32:30,437 --> 00:32:33,162
Hey, I'm gonna go down
to Santa Fe to meet Gil.

664
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:36,329
Oh. What? So everything
has been resolved in there?

665
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:39,121
Yeah. Totally.

666
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:41,329
We're all completely sane. All resolved.

667
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:42,353
Uh-huh. Come on.

668
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:46,621
Can I take a car?
What's up?

669
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:48,621
Wait. What are you doing?
The Tesla.

670
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:50,705
I'm going into town. I've got a meeting.

671
00:32:50,729 --> 00:32:52,580
I'm not gonna take this
seriously if no one else is.

672
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,288
But we're getting somewhere, Shiv.

673
00:32:54,312 --> 00:32:56,037
I can feel it. He's breaking down.

674
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:59,288
You're sweet and I love
you, but you're delusional.

675
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,705
Well, you can't do that. Is that allowed?

676
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:06,121
Well, I think Shiv is capable
of making an adult decision.

677
00:33:06,145 --> 00:33:08,413
But here's what I was thinkin'.

678
00:33:08,437 --> 00:33:10,496
Why don't we all take a break? Huh?

679
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,454
Just get out of our heads
and into our good bodies.

680
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:15,413
You know? Let's go for a swim.

681
00:33:15,437 --> 00:33:17,871
Everybody. You know?
Get your dad out there.

682
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,162
Dad can't swim. Yeah.

683
00:33:19,186 --> 00:33:21,204
He doesn't even trust water.

684
00:33:21,228 --> 00:33:22,621
It's too wishy-washy.

685
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:23,663
Can I have the keys?

686
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:25,954
Thank you.
Seriously?

687
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:26,996
Yeah.

688
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,705
Hey, Willa.
Yeah?

689
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:30,162
Hey, honey,

690
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:32,580
do you know about the
family photo for later?

691
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:34,121
Yeah, it'll be nice.

692
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,788
Yeah, well, um,

693
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:39,079
there was an idea that
maybe you should sit it out.

694
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:42,121
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry.

695
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,538
No, no, it's OK. I'll probably
end up getting murdered anyway.

696
00:33:45,562 --> 00:33:47,246
Nobody's murdering you.

697
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,496
You're adorable.

698
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,538
You're unmurderable.

699
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:56,520
Um... Look, you know...

700
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:03,538
You know I appreciate you.

701
00:34:03,562 --> 00:34:05,204
I appreciate you, too.

702
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:07,371
And I think you're better than all of them.

703
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:09,746
Th-Thank you.

704
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,621
Look, I know that we
talked about this before,

705
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:16,121
but I was just wondering

706
00:34:16,145 --> 00:34:19,204
if you could...

707
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:21,687
well, would you...

708
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:25,871
I don't know how to say this,

709
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:30,871
except to say that love is a
strange and peculiar affliction.

710
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:34,037
It's- It's like a virus.

711
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:38,413
So could you please
just stay here for a while...

712
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:41,246
and maybe you'll catch it.
Con.

713
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,871
What I mean is that you
would have an allowance

714
00:34:42,895 --> 00:34:44,580
and you would continue to write

715
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:46,580
and you continue to travel to New York,

716
00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:49,936
and I would help you
build a life in the theater.

717
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:53,246
Gosh, that's a lot.

718
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,037
Yeah, but we have so many great ideas.

719
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,621
Yeah. Sure. No, we do.

720
00:34:58,645 --> 00:35:01,912
So we could do family,
but we could do it different.

721
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:04,538
I mean...

722
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,079
we could try.

723
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,954
Exactly! Why not? Yeah?

724
00:35:07,978 --> 00:35:09,204
Yeah!

725
00:35:09,228 --> 00:35:11,329
Yeah?
Yeah.

726
00:35:11,353 --> 00:35:12,996
Hey, I love you.

727
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,912
And... I, um...

728
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:18,437
I love you.

729
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:26,145
See? That wasn't so hard, was it?

730
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:32,538
OK. Lot of wolf stuff.

731
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:35,079
Yeah, man, I love the wolves.

732
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:36,871
Uh-huh.

733
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:40,204
He really likes the wolves.
Yeah. Cool.

734
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:42,204
My mom says I was a wolf child.

735
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:44,371
That's 'cause she never bothered
to take care of you, Chang.

736
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:47,663
That's just fuckin'
salesmanship of her neglect.

737
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,996
Nice.

738
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,037
You get wolves here?
Nope.

739
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:55,312
No? OK.
Fuckin' wish.

740
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:00,954
I never did meth.

741
00:36:00,978 --> 00:36:03,121
And I'm technically sober,

742
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:05,437
so this is kind of an experiment.

743
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:14,687
There we go.

744
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:45,812
Wow.

745
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:56,395
There's a thing now that Type
A's actually can't get addicted.

746
00:36:57,895 --> 00:36:59,705
Ya know? 'Cause we are addicted.

747
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:02,162
You know, if it wasn't for
wolves, we couldn't speak.

748
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,871
It's from having to tell dogs what to do

749
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:07,121
that we actually had
a need to talk out loud,

750
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:08,454
you know, to command 'em?

751
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:11,162
You guys, come on. We got a real person.

752
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:13,538
Let's not attack his brain.

753
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:15,204
We should get some more.

754
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:16,871
Fuck, yeah.
Yeah?

755
00:37:16,895 --> 00:37:19,288
And, uh, maybe some weed.

756
00:37:19,312 --> 00:37:21,912
Right.
Some Oxys, some...

757
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:23,246
some goodies.

758
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,037
So, you like it?

759
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:28,204
Experiment successful.

760
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:29,912
I am interested in becoming a meth head.

761
00:37:29,936 --> 00:37:31,663
Yeah.

762
00:37:31,687 --> 00:37:35,079
Well, we're the fuckin' right people, dude!

763
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:37,705
Hey.
Hi. You comin' in?

764
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:39,663
Oh, yeah.
Good.

765
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:41,580
Don't be afraid of what's down there.

766
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:43,746
Pretend it's our
subconscious and just go for it.

767
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,830
I know how to dive.

768
00:37:44,854 --> 00:37:46,121
Yeah, you gotta jump.

769
00:37:46,145 --> 00:37:48,746
You want me to jump?
Jump! Jump! Jump!

770
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,871
Jump, ya fuckin' pussy!
Jump! Jump! Jump!

771
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,580
Excuse me, there's been
an accident in the pool.

772
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,413
What did he say?

773
00:37:56,437 --> 00:37:58,204
An accident in the pool.

774
00:37:58,228 --> 00:38:01,912
We don't know if he
got a head injury, or...

775
00:38:01,936 --> 00:38:03,538
He just dived in and he hit the bottom.

776
00:38:03,562 --> 00:38:05,580
Did you hit your head?

777
00:38:05,604 --> 00:38:07,830
He hit his teeth?
His teeth are in his head,

778
00:38:07,854 --> 00:38:09,621
Connor, it's kind of a central feature.

779
00:38:09,645 --> 00:38:10,912
It's clearly signed.
What were you thinking?

780
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:12,954
Shall I call an ambulance?

781
00:38:12,978 --> 00:38:14,746
I didn't think he'd jump
in headfirst. Hi, Karolina.

782
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,496
Hey, Roman. Don't let him go to sleep.

783
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,996
I don't want to go to fuckin' sleep!

784
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,788
Let's take a look. The bleeding always

785
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:21,705
makes it look worse than it actually...

786
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:22,788
Jesus Christ!

787
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:24,954
Let's take him to the hospital.

788
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:27,538
Really?
No, you're OK, man.

789
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:28,830
It's OK. You look OK.

790
00:38:28,854 --> 00:38:30,538
It'll be faster if I just take him myself.

791
00:38:30,562 --> 00:38:32,288
No, no, no, send your guys. Send Colin.

792
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:34,580
We should stay.
No, I want to help him ou...

793
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,288
I want to make sure he's not litigious.

794
00:38:36,312 --> 00:38:38,912
Fuckin' great! And I was about
to take advice from a clown

795
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:43,538
who dives headfirst into the shallow end of
the pool! And now everyone's fucking off!

796
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:44,663
It's OK. I got you.

797
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:45,954
Roman is here.

798
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:48,371
He's here for the photos, for everything.

799
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:51,687
Sure. I give good cheekbone.
OK.

800
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:01,854
Gil.

801
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,996
Siobhan Roy.

802
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,162
The acceptable face of
the worst family in America.

803
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:13,936
Yeah. Gil Eavis. Stalin in a plaid shirt.

804
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:18,562
OK. Well, happy meeting.

805
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:26,996
So... how are you?

806
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,663
Really?

807
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:31,329
Well, my family's fucked.

808
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:34,538
I'm not talking about to my dad,
and my brother's suing my dad.

809
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:38,204
Sorry. If family isn't
right, nothing feels right.

810
00:39:38,228 --> 00:39:40,204
Yeah. And how are you?

811
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:41,580
You gonna go for it?

812
00:39:41,604 --> 00:39:44,621
I'm feeling really good.

813
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:48,912
Suffered some depression
last year after everything,

814
00:39:48,936 --> 00:39:51,996
but, um... I'm good.

815
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,871
And so, what, you want me
to handle the message on that?

816
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:57,246
No. That's just the truth.

817
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,454
Look, Siobhan,

818
00:39:59,478 --> 00:40:01,663
I'm not gonna make you do a dance.

819
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:04,371
I'm finalizing. Nate and
me want you on the team.

820
00:40:04,395 --> 00:40:05,705
What do you think?

821
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:07,770
Well, I think you're too radical.

822
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:12,496
I'm not telling you
anything you don't know.

823
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,663
The good politician, he
figures out what people need

824
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:17,770
and then he sells it back
to them as what they want.

825
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:21,912
So... this is a job offer?

826
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:23,037
Well, yes.

827
00:40:23,061 --> 00:40:24,496
But there's an issue.

828
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,454
What, my name?

829
00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:29,996
One section of my base would be
outraged for me even meeting with you.

830
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,580
Yeah, well, that section has
nowhere else to go, so fuck 'em.

831
00:40:33,604 --> 00:40:35,103
Yeah.

832
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:40,329
Look, if I'm gonna win
big the way I want to,

833
00:40:40,353 --> 00:40:42,204
to remake this country for the better...

834
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:43,871
Ooh! La-dee-dah.

835
00:40:43,895 --> 00:40:46,079
I need to spike your father's guns.

836
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:49,228
The papers, the news channels.

837
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,037
I can't help with that.

838
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:53,788
No, no, no, of course. Of course.

839
00:40:53,812 --> 00:40:56,788
But I'm gonna go for his throat.

840
00:40:56,812 --> 00:40:58,496
Legally, legislatively,

841
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,288
hearings, referrals.

842
00:41:00,312 --> 00:41:02,871
I thought I should tell you.

843
00:41:02,895 --> 00:41:04,437
It'll be ugly.

844
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,954
And how do you know
that I won't betray you?

845
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:12,478
Well, I guess I trust you.

846
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:20,788
I can work with Nate,
but I can't work for Nate.

847
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,413
It's fine, it's just a- it's
a preposition thing.

848
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:24,830
We can figure all that out.

849
00:41:24,854 --> 00:41:27,121
The bigger question is,

850
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:29,645
do you want this enough to
go to war with your family?

851
00:41:35,854 --> 00:41:37,812
Can we do the walking and talking?

852
00:41:37,936 --> 00:41:39,788
What?
Walking and talking.

853
00:41:39,812 --> 00:41:41,580
He wants us to be talking.
Oh.

854
00:41:41,604 --> 00:41:42,996
That looks good.
Thank you.

855
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,037
We look great, apparently.
Uh-huh.

856
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:46,663
I want you to call Japan.

857
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:49,954
We got the office set up here.

858
00:41:49,978 --> 00:41:52,246
I'm tickling Sandy on local.

859
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,413
I want you to get into
the government issues

860
00:41:55,437 --> 00:41:58,186
of the launch detail.
Right. Sure.

861
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,788
Do you actually want me
to do that, or are you just

862
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,329
saying shit for the camera?
No.

863
00:42:05,353 --> 00:42:08,954
You're a COO, aren't you?

864
00:42:08,978 --> 00:42:10,538
Huh?
Yeah.

865
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,162
Well?
Sure. I got it.

866
00:42:13,186 --> 00:42:15,729
I mean, I was just checking.

867
00:42:16,854 --> 00:42:18,204
Thank you, gentlemen.

868
00:42:18,228 --> 00:42:19,830
That's really grand.

869
00:42:19,854 --> 00:42:21,496
Yeah?
This looks imperial here.

870
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,204
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

871
00:42:23,228 --> 00:42:24,663
Did he say "imperial"?
Imperial.

872
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:25,936
What the hell does that mean?

873
00:42:38,562 --> 00:42:40,246
Yeah, he's good.

874
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:43,162
Yes.
Yeah.

875
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:44,687
So?

876
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:49,663
I don't...

877
00:42:49,687 --> 00:42:51,996
I don't know.

878
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,228
I...

879
00:42:55,562 --> 00:42:56,687
OK.

880
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,954
OK?
OK.

881
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:05,121
Right?

882
00:43:05,145 --> 00:43:06,454
Fuck, yes.

883
00:43:06,478 --> 00:43:09,538
I mean, I told him that
he would have to fire you

884
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:11,228
if he was gonna hire me, but...

885
00:43:13,103 --> 00:43:14,830
It's fine.
OK.

886
00:43:14,854 --> 00:43:16,812
For the good of the country.
Right.

887
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:23,621
My Airbnb has a, um...

888
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:25,520
memory foam mattress.

889
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,037
How 'bout we...

890
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:32,121
give it some... memories?

891
00:43:32,145 --> 00:43:34,270
Ooh. Wow.

892
00:43:40,936 --> 00:43:42,312
Turn it off.

893
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:46,145
Turn it off.

894
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:07,037
Let's just...

895
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,912
sit here a minute and...

896
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:12,270
So I can think.

897
00:44:19,186 --> 00:44:21,413
He sees Oprah walkin' down the street,

898
00:44:21,437 --> 00:44:24,996
he's like, "Oprah, you
get a car. You get a car."

899
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,079
He's so rich he needs a
golf cart to pass the salt.

900
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:28,162
He's so rich

901
00:44:28,186 --> 00:44:29,871
his goldfish wear furs.

902
00:44:29,895 --> 00:44:31,454
Yeah, yeah, fish fur.

903
00:44:31,478 --> 00:44:34,746
He's so rich that his
sperm has little top hats

904
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,288
and monocles and shit.

905
00:44:36,312 --> 00:44:37,830
Yeah. "Good day, vagina."

906
00:44:37,854 --> 00:44:39,621
May I enter thou?"

907
00:44:39,645 --> 00:44:42,037
You know, I don't even
care that you're richer than us.

908
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:44,204
I mean, who's better off, ultimately?

909
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:48,621
I mean, clearly, you are,
but... fuck it, who cares?

910
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,496
I do.

911
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,037
Guys, I gotta make a quick call.

912
00:44:53,061 --> 00:44:54,478
Yeah, go for it.
Yeah.

913
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:07,037
Uh, hey.
Bro.

914
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:09,413
I've got a lot of important
information in play.

915
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:12,121
What? Where are you?
I'm in New Mexico.

916
00:45:12,145 --> 00:45:14,288
What?
I realize now.

917
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,454
Are you high?

918
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:17,413
No. I'm at some guy's house.

919
00:45:17,437 --> 00:45:19,538
I mean, yeah, we been taking drugs,

920
00:45:19,562 --> 00:45:21,121
but I'm very clear.

921
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:24,788
Uh, can you drop me a
pin so I know you're OK?

922
00:45:24,812 --> 00:45:27,621
We're OK. There- That's
nothing wrong with us.

923
00:45:27,645 --> 00:45:30,288
Just drop me a fucking pin.
I'm not gonna come get you.

924
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:31,663
Do it now. Are you doing it?

925
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,936
Yeah, OK. Hold on.

926
00:45:37,312 --> 00:45:38,996
Here ya go.

927
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,288
OK. I'm comin' to get you, man.

928
00:45:41,312 --> 00:45:42,538
Are you doing the call?

929
00:45:42,562 --> 00:45:44,705
Uh, yeah, uh, yes. I will.

930
00:45:44,729 --> 00:45:46,830
But, um, I'm going to get Kendall.

931
00:45:46,854 --> 00:45:49,395
He's here, and he's not great.

932
00:45:51,978 --> 00:45:53,413
OK, go. Go. Go.

933
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:56,103
Yeah, OK. But no, I
will. I'll make the call.

934
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,162
Who the fuck is that?
Oh.

935
00:46:14,186 --> 00:46:15,954
Kendall.

936
00:46:15,978 --> 00:46:18,871
Who the fuck is that?
It's cool, it's my brother.

937
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:21,478
It's cool. Let him in.

938
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,996
Jesus. Fuck.

939
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,705
Chang. Let him in, man.

940
00:46:29,729 --> 00:46:31,288
Thank you.

941
00:46:31,312 --> 00:46:34,645
Oh! Wow. Hi.

942
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:38,454
Gonna offer me a cup of tea?

943
00:46:38,478 --> 00:46:41,746
I like what you've done with the wolves.

944
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,954
Yo, Chang, show him- show
him your wolf tattoo.

945
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:46,604
Do the howl, Chang.

946
00:46:48,978 --> 00:46:51,454
Wow. Funny and cool.

947
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:54,121
Yo. This is Chang, Tanner,

948
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,621
that's Mac.

949
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:57,538
So great to meet you guys.

950
00:46:57,562 --> 00:46:59,162
Let's get outta here. Come on.

951
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:02,621
You know, I was thinking I
probably shouldn't talk to you

952
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:05,621
given the ongoing situation

953
00:47:05,645 --> 00:47:08,954
apropos of my legal action against you

954
00:47:08,978 --> 00:47:12,996
as a board member for your
failure to fulfill your fiduciary duty

955
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,996
and breaching my employment contract,

956
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,329
but then, I don't know, but then
I thought, "Who fucking cares?"

957
00:47:18,353 --> 00:47:20,830
What- Is this...

958
00:47:20,854 --> 00:47:22,204
What is this?

959
00:47:22,228 --> 00:47:24,371
What is this, fuckin' crank?

960
00:47:24,395 --> 00:47:27,604
We've been having a lot of fun, Mom.

961
00:47:30,353 --> 00:47:31,996
Yeah. That's good.

962
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,538
Yo, seriously. You should try this.

963
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:35,454
I would love to, some other time.

964
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,788
I hear that shit makes you
crash like an airbus full of eggs.

965
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:40,788
Not if you stay high.

966
00:47:40,812 --> 00:47:42,371
Tanner makes good points.

967
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:44,663
I think this lighter is fucked.

968
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:46,496
That is a really good point.

969
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,871
You know what? Let's
get the fuck out of here.

970
00:47:48,895 --> 00:47:50,204
Come on.

971
00:47:50,228 --> 00:47:53,413
That's enough. I can fix that. Here.

972
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,663
Oh, hey,

973
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:56,246
how's the family therapy?

974
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,121
Oh, the therapy? It was total bullshit.

975
00:47:58,145 --> 00:47:59,621
He didn't even do it.

976
00:47:59,645 --> 00:48:01,663
He didn't do it?
No. He didn't.

977
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:04,121
Come on.
I'm coming. Let's do it.

978
00:48:04,145 --> 00:48:07,037
Hey, man, your friend sucks.

979
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:10,037
That's my brother.
Your brother sucks.

980
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:12,246
He's actually- You know what?

981
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:14,246
He's OK.
Thanks.

982
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:16,663
Our people will reach out to your people.

983
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:18,954
Hey, Kendall! Tell Bill Gates

984
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:22,604
my computer's fucked up
from all the fuckin' updates, man!

985
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:28,729
You OK?

986
00:48:29,812 --> 00:48:31,729
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

987
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:36,496
Should I call a doctor? Rava?

988
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,954
You want me to hit a kid
so I can steal his kidneys?

989
00:48:39,978 --> 00:48:42,746
Fuck. I'm sorry.

990
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:46,621
I have to make a call. It's the...

991
00:48:46,645 --> 00:48:49,329
It's the launch in Japan thing.

992
00:48:49,353 --> 00:48:51,580
Um, is that cool?

993
00:48:51,604 --> 00:48:52,788
It's OK.

994
00:48:52,812 --> 00:48:53,912
Yeah?

995
00:48:53,936 --> 00:48:54,978
You do your call.

996
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:58,604

Hey.
Hi.

1012
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,246
Hi.
Hi.

1013
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,454
You're late.

1014
00:50:06,478 --> 00:50:10,162
So, what happened with the fake therapy?

1015
00:50:10,186 --> 00:50:13,371
Any pretend breakthroughs?
Any good performances?

1016
00:50:13,395 --> 00:50:15,788
Nothing. Our therapist died.

1017
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,329
What?
Metaphorically speaking.

1018
00:50:18,353 --> 00:50:21,037
He smashed his teeth out in the pool.

1019
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:22,329
Oh, my God.

1020
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,580
Freud would have had a field day.

1021
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,162
Where you been?

1022
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:28,329
I was meeting about a prospective job.

1023
00:50:28,353 --> 00:50:29,996
With your father's enemy?

1024
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,079
OK, I'm gonna go to bed.

1025
00:50:33,103 --> 00:50:34,996
I keep an eye on things, Siobhan.

1026
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,329
I keep an eye.

1027
00:50:36,353 --> 00:50:37,996
What is that supposed to mean?

1028
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,329
I mean, I had a meeting.

1029
00:50:39,353 --> 00:50:41,204
You do whatever the hell you like,

1030
00:50:41,228 --> 00:50:42,871
on everything, forever...

1031
00:50:42,895 --> 00:50:44,871
Why don't we chat this over in the morning?

1032
00:50:44,895 --> 00:50:47,871
And he has to hear it
from his so-called friends,

1033
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:50,746
on the phone, dripping poison in his ear.

1034
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,204
Fami-ly therapy!

1035
00:50:52,228 --> 00:50:54,079
Kenny.

1036
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:56,788
Fami-ly therapy!

1037
00:50:56,812 --> 00:50:59,871
Fami-ly therapy!

1038
00:50:59,895 --> 00:51:01,788
Hey, hey, hey!

1039
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:03,746
What up, motherfuckers!

1040
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,538
Sorry I'm late. What are we arguing about?

1041
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:09,288
What's wrong with him?
Oh, where do we start?

1042
00:51:09,312 --> 00:51:11,371
I'm off my nut, folks.

1043
00:51:11,395 --> 00:51:14,037
Off my fuckin' nut.
Oh, my God.

1044
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:16,121
Like all the papers said.

1045
00:51:16,145 --> 00:51:18,288
Your dreams have come
true. Congratulations.

1046
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:20,912
Just so you know, I think
things are good with the launch.

1047
00:51:20,936 --> 00:51:24,121
I talked to the guy...
He doesn't care.

1048
00:51:24,145 --> 00:51:26,371
He doesn't even fuckin' notice.

1049
00:51:26,395 --> 00:51:28,621
Dad, give him a high five.

1050
00:51:28,645 --> 00:51:30,371
Cone on. He's waiting. Dad?

1051
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:33,204
You'd do that to me? Eavis.

1052
00:51:33,228 --> 00:51:35,954
The one senate member
who wants to fuck me ragged.

1053
00:51:35,978 --> 00:51:38,079
On the same side as those animals

1054
00:51:38,103 --> 00:51:40,079
that hit me with a bag of piss.

1055
00:51:40,103 --> 00:51:42,746
It's my work, Dad. You of all
people ought to understand that.

1056
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,037
Work?! It's rebellion! Sabotage!

1057
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:47,413
Yeah, of course, 'cause it's all about you.

1058
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:51,371
Not that I might be in agreement
with his points about the purchases,

1059
00:51:51,395 --> 00:51:52,912
or just maybe his whole philosophy.

1060
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:54,413
Philosophy?

1061
00:51:54,437 --> 00:51:57,496
This is nothing but a
miserable deliberate attempt

1062
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,746
to undermine my whole business strategy.

1063
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:02,746
You don't have a business strategy, Dad.

1064
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:07,413
Your whole business model is
based on seducing presidents.

1065
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:09,705
You're a really high-class hooker.

1066
00:52:09,729 --> 00:52:11,246
No offense.
Hey.

1067
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:12,538
Fuck off.

1068
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:15,288
It's fine. My aunt's an addict.

1069
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:17,288
It's been a long day. It's been really nice

1070
00:52:17,312 --> 00:52:19,079
getting to know you all a bit better.

1071
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:21,079
Good night.
Good night.

1072
00:52:21,103 --> 00:52:24,454
I gotta say I feel a
little bit used today, Pa.

1073
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:27,162
Oh, for fuck's sake. Not you too.

1074
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:29,246
Where we are and all that's happened,

1075
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,246
and then even tonight you
have to go off and work?

1076
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:33,621
I made some calls. Jesus. Can't you wait?

1077
00:52:33,645 --> 00:52:35,538
Can I wait for you to finish a few calls?

1078
00:52:35,562 --> 00:52:39,454
Yeah, I think so, Pa.
I've had a bit of practice.

1079
00:52:39,478 --> 00:52:41,621
Connor.
Quite a bit.

1080
00:52:41,645 --> 00:52:44,246
Connor, your father has been busy

1081
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,037
dealing with these two traitors.

1082
00:52:46,061 --> 00:52:49,288
Disagreeing with Dad is not treason.

1083
00:52:49,312 --> 00:52:53,162
But trying to make one of his biggest
enemies president is kind of a "fuck you."

1084
00:52:53,186 --> 00:52:55,288
Oh, hey, Dad. Dad.

1085
00:52:55,312 --> 00:52:57,663
I like those stories you planted about me.

1086
00:52:57,687 --> 00:52:59,454
That was...

1087
00:52:59,478 --> 00:53:02,037
Yes. You forced my hand.
There it is.

1088
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:05,371
Yes! And he's fuckin' lucky that was all.

1089
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:08,454
What you kids do not understand,

1090
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:10,204
it's all part of the game.

1091
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,788
Oh, it's all part of the game.

1092
00:53:11,812 --> 00:53:13,705
Come on, everybody.

1093
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:16,830
It's a rootin'-tooti"
super fuckin' fun game

1094
00:53:16,854 --> 00:53:18,580
for all the family!

1095
00:53:18,604 --> 00:53:20,204
Step right up!

1096
00:53:20,228 --> 00:53:23,912
You run towards politics to
prove that you're your own man.

1097
00:53:23,936 --> 00:53:26,954
Fine. But that's not principle.

1098
00:53:26,978 --> 00:53:29,496
You're scared to compete.

1099
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,079
You're marrying a man fathoms beneath you

1100
00:53:32,103 --> 00:53:35,413
because you don't want
to risk being betrayed.

1101
00:53:35,437 --> 00:53:37,228
You're a fucking coward.

1102
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:40,871
Wow.

1103
00:53:40,895 --> 00:53:42,895
Wow, you are just beyond.

1104
00:53:48,936 --> 00:53:51,954
You know... I was born lucky.

1105
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,454
I'm a lucky person.

1106
00:53:54,478 --> 00:53:57,496
I realize that.

1107
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,788
And you're so fuckin' jealous, aren't you?

1108
00:54:00,812 --> 00:54:05,037
You're so fuckin' jealous of
what you've given your own kids.

1109
00:54:05,061 --> 00:54:07,371
You can't handle it.

1110
00:54:07,395 --> 00:54:09,538
You c- You can't work it out.

1111
00:54:09,562 --> 00:54:12,204
If I had spoken to my uncle like that...

1112
00:54:12,228 --> 00:54:14,705
What? Hmm? What would evil Uncle Noah do?

1113
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:17,580
Calling your daughter
a coward till she cries?

1114
00:54:17,604 --> 00:54:20,079
Big man.
Logan. Logan. Logan.

1115
00:54:20,103 --> 00:54:22,437
Logan. Logan!

1116
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,079
You are a fucking nobody.

1117
00:54:28,103 --> 00:54:29,936
Fuckin' nobody.

1118
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,538
As always.
Good to see you.

1119
00:55:42,562 --> 00:55:43,954
I'm sorry. You know.

1120
00:55:43,978 --> 00:55:45,663
No. It's fine.
Well...

1121
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:47,454
you know, it wasn't great.

1122
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:48,538
But you had some fun, right?

1123
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:49,788
Yeah.
You had some fun here?

1124
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:52,871
OK. You come back and see me?
Yeah.

1125
00:55:52,895 --> 00:55:54,371
It was really fun.
Buddy, I'm sorry.

1126
00:55:54,395 --> 00:55:55,621
No, don't.
It was just such a drag.

1127
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:57,121
No, no. It was good fun.

1128
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,996
You had some fun, right?
Yeah, absolutely.

1129
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,520
All right, bye.
OK. Bye.

1130
00:56:03,228 --> 00:56:05,061
Bye-bye.
Call me.

1131
00:56:12,854 --> 00:56:15,663
It's funny, I wanted 'em all here.

1132
00:56:15,687 --> 00:56:18,496
But I feel relieved they're starting to go.

1133
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,246
Hmm.

1134
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:22,895
It'll be nicer when it's just us.

1135
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:27,705
How far is it to a Starbucks?

1136
00:56:27,729 --> 00:56:30,729
I have pods.
OK. Great.

1137
00:57:05,312 --> 00:57:07,103
That's it. There you go.

1138
00:57:27,103 --> 00:57:28,145
All right.
