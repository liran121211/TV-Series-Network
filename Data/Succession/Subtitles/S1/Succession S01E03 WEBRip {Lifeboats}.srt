1
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,386
What if, after you die,

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,682
part of you goes to heaven,
part of you stays here?

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,728
Just to see how things turn out.

4
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,693
Wind Gap.
There was a murder there.

5
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,404
Another one's missing now.
Get me a story.

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,532
Hi, Momma.

7
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,451
Goodness, I didn't expect you.

8
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,453
The house is not
up to par for visitors.

9
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,539
I'm just in town
on business.

10
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,291
Camille, look at you.
I'm glad you're home.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,671
What kind of person does that?
Hurt a child?

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,090
Doesn't help anything,
riling folks up.

13
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,467
You got two
mutilated girls on your hands.

14
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,469
Someone else is
doing the riling.

15
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,599
When you're here,
you're my daughter.

16
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,936
Everything you do
comes back on me.

17
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,107
I didn't come back
to cause any problems.

18
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,945
I can tell.
You hate this place, like me.

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,407
Someone in this town's
hiding something.

20
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,286
Momma says
I need to be careful around you.

21
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,330
Is that true?

22
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,792
Are you dangerous?

23
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:41,977
My dad's in the hospital.

24
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,061
I don't know
if he's gonna be okay.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,523
What's the situation?

26
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,899
He's had a hemorrhagic stroke.

27
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:48,984
My assistant's been in touch

28
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,736
with NYU and we might
move Dad there.

29
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,488
No. He stays here.

30
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,450
I am his proxy.
I am in charge.

31
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,413
The board has a plan in the
event of Logan's incapacitation.

32
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,833
I'll be taking temporary charge
as CEO and chairman.

33
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,252
It wouldn't necessarily be you.
It could be me.

34
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,129
How can I not be
the logical choice?

35
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,505
Dad didn't want you running
the company.

36
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,134
We go for it. Me and you.
CEO and COO.

37
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,135
Okay.

38
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,723
Will you marry me?
Yeah, whatever.

39
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,224
Yes?

40
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,351
Do you know that he gave me
a job?

41
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,603
Come in and see me,
and I'll look after you.

42
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,522
There's a huge debt problem.
Three billion.

43
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,067
You're making it quite fucking
difficult to savor this moment,

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,401
Geri.
Don't jump.

45
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,488
There's a lot of mess
to be cleaned up, Kendall,

46
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,239
but you can do it, son.

47
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,831
Richard, can you get me
the price of the Waystar stock?

48
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,000
At close last night, please.
How is he?

49
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,253
Good. A little clearer.
He tried to put on a sock.

50
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,921
Hey.

51
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,090
Morning.

52
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,887
Hey, Mondale.
Wish me luck, buddy.

53
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,889
Wish me luck.

54
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,223
What's that? "Good luck, Tom!

55
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,392
Hope it goes well!" OK, so,

56
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,686
just wanted to say goodbye.

57
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,354
Have you seen the numbers?

58
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,065
Man, poor Ken. He's like
dysentery for the stock price.

59
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,526
You are walking
into a burning barn.

60
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,903
Still excited.

61
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,155
Still rarin' to go.
Mm...hmm.

62
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,866
Whoa.

63
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,910
I'm just paying homage.

64
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,203
What's that?

65
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,538
You miss me?
Well, I miss you too.

66
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,874
Maybe we should arrange a date
while she's not around.

67
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,127
You're weird.
No, you are weird! OK!

68
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,005
Goodbye.
Oh, Tom.

69
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,298
I'm gonna go see Dad.

70
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,342
If Marcia wants to be difficult,
so can I.

71
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,053
So...can you come with me?

72
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,138
Uh, I gotta stay in front
on this one, baby.

73
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,139
It's a hugie.

74
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,682
My first morning stepping up.

75
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,227
Just say you went
to see the big boss.

76
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,686
Don't make me choose, Shiv.

77
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,190
Please. Don't make me choose.

78
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,692
It's a man's right
not to choose.

79
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,570
Hey, Rava. Can you
give me 30 seconds?

80
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,989
Sorry, I'm just
getting the kids ready.

81
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,116
Oh, Luanne,
can you get...

82
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,743
Yeah? OK.

83
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,828
Hey.
Hi.

84
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,913
Uh, yeah, so...

85
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,459
this is... this is dumb,
but bank call this morning,

86
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,045
and I just wanted to ask...

87
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,089
Wait. What bank?
Our old joint account?

88
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,926
Um, no, no, Rava,
the bank.

89
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,763
ICBC, who have apparently
bankrolled the old man for years.

90
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,808
I'm sorry.
I'm... just in a rush. OK.

91
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,643
Just two minutes?

92
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,811
What's your read?

93
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,981
Do I go... do I go Hulk,
or Bruce Banner?

94
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,484
Well, K... Kendall,
talk to your people about...

95
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:04,239
I know, you're just...you're
always so good with this stuff, and just, uh...

96
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,825
The Hulk is the incredible one,
right? The Hulk.

97
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,368
We have to go. I'm sorry.

98
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,620
Why don't you ask Roman? OK?

99
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,998
Guys?
Roma... Rava. Come on.

100
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,374
Seriously?
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,500
Bye!

102
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,919
Bye, guys.
Bye...bye. I love you.

103
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,935
Out of ten?
Uh, seven.

104
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,728
OK.

105
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,438
You're in decent shape,

106
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,274
you're a little sloppy,
but I can get you tight as a drum.

107
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,820
Ah. Well, I trust Pax,
and Pax says you're the best.

108
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,238
I'm only gonna say
one thing, Roman, OK?

109
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,155
Go for it.

110
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,657
I take my shit serious,

111
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,200
that's why I have
the reputation that I do,

112
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,660
and I need you
to take it serious, too. OK?

113
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,120
Dude, I'm...I'm onboard,

114
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,497
so you can skip the whole
speech bullshit, OK?

115
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,582
I'm down.
All right. 5:30 every day.

116
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,168
Yeah, man, I'm serious.
I'm serious as cancer.

117
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,880
Fuckin' more serious.
Fuckin' money cancer.

118
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,466
You know, I'm COO now.

119
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,676
Mm...hmm.
Yeah.

120
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,137
That's Chief Operating Officer.

121
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,141
It's Waystar Royco,
so if it operates, I chief it.

122
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,184
Flip over on your belly.

123
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,521
Yeah.
Ahh.

124
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,482
But yeah, no,
5:30, that's perfect.

125
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,818
A. M. right?
Yup.

126
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,821
Well, good, because the other 5:30
I'll be at work, ya know?

127
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,699
Being an agent of change
and fuckin' firing people.

128
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,039
Thank you.

129
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,582
Ask her to wait there.

130
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,083
Oh! She's here.

131
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,169
It's the morphine.

132
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,880
It's not that unusual.
I know. I'm fine.

133
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,882
Is everything all right?
Hi, Shiv.

134
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,550
Hi!
Hi, Tom.

135
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,260
Hey. I'm afraid I can't stay.

136
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,262
Excuse me one second.
First day.

137
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,683
Hi.
What's the...

138
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,684
What's going on?

139
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,144
Nothing.
No?

140
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,688
Staff.

141
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,691
Good to see you.

142
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,693
Yeah. I know you said
that he wasn't great,

143
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,944
but I was passing by,

144
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,196
so I thought I'd just
drop in.

145
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,697
That is so sweet.

146
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,742
But you know, he's not
seeing people right now.

147
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,119
Yeah, but I thought
I could just pop up.

148
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,246
Even if, you know, he's grumpy.

149
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,873
I think it's best you don't.

150
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,542
Marcia, I've seen my dad
do the Master Cleanse.

151
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,711
I can take him
a little bit grouchy.

152
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,963
I'm afraid that
is out of the question.

153
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,801
Um, do you...
Might it be an idea

154
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,720
to check and see whether
he's changed his mind?

155
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,222
Yeah.
Perked up a little bit?

156
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,182
Of course.

157
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,190
What the fuck?

158
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,025
I know. I have to go.

159
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,193
Yeah, I know.

160
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,736
Oh, hey. Hello. Hi!

161
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,071
I'm Shiv.

162
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,448
Logan's daughter.

163
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,992
I just...I wanted
to say thank you for...

164
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,244
for all your work.

165
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,246
You're quite welcome.

166
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,832
Yeah. It's much appreciated.
Thank you.

167
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,917
And how does he seem today?

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,960
Good?

169
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,170
Oh... you know.

170
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,713
Actually, we don't.

171
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,966
We heard al about the sock.

172
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,343
Yeah.

173
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,112
It'll stabilize.

174
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,990
Mm...hmm. I know.
I know it will.

175
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,535
So... I've been thinking.

176
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,912
I've got a new game plan
for the call.

177
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,289
Uh...huh.

178
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,749
Hey. Can you try and not
look so fuckin' nervous?

179
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,001
I know what I'm doing.

180
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,460
I'm relaxed.

181
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,629
I just think it's a little late,
considering the gravity

182
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,173
and the need to get
the relationship right.

183
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,467
Sure. The...The new strategy
is really just a refinement

184
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,219
of all this great work.

185
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,305
It goes, uh...

186
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:24,058
Well, the working title
is "Go Fuck Yourself."

187
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,894
Uh...huh.

188
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,771
Hi, I have Mr. Polk.

189
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,648
Uh...huh. What do you think?

190
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,026
I think I need a little bit
more of an explanation.

191
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,987
My dad's a bastard,
they need to know I'm a bastard, too.

192
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,363
Right?
Right...

193
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,531
Great.

194
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,159
Hey, Mr. Polk.

195
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,037
Hi, Kendall, good to connect.

196
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,165
Likewise. Yeah, great.

197
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,420
So, you...you wanna go?

198
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,838
Well, why don't you go?

199
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,926
OK. Well, uh, sure.

200
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,512
We just wanted to make contact,
given where we are.

201
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,432
Mm...hmm. We are concerned.
Absolutely.

202
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,227
Now, obviously, look,
the main thing is,

203
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,854
we just handle this very calmly,

204
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,689
because the last thing
either of us want

205
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,192
is for this rather private
arrangement my father made

206
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,153
to, uh, you know, make waves.

207
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,697
Absolutely.
But I guess the issue is

208
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,866
we owe you 3.2 billion...

209
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,493
3.25.

210
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,036
Hey, I was rounding down.

211
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,204
We round up.

212
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,040
3.25 billion,

213
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,042
secured against
Waystar stock,

214
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,545
which is, you know, undergoing
some temporary turbulence

215
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,714
due to sector...wide factors.

216
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,966
Mm...hmm.

217
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,843
So, I guess, you know,

218
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,512
what I'd like to know is,

219
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,222
what your position will be

220
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,391
if we have a sustained breach
of the stock price

221
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,560
and we fall out of compliance
with our debt covenant?

222
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,063
OK, well, if the stock drops,

223
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,940
we're entitled to ask
for a payment in full.

224
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,942
Uh...huh, exactly.

225
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,904
Technically, uh, yeah.

226
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:04,826
So... what will we do here
in reality?

227
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,787
If it breaches 130,
you've broken the covenant

228
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,580
and we will want repayment.

229
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,291
Right.

230
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,917
I know.

231
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,504
But, um, like, really?

232
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,339
Seriously.

233
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,469
OK, I-I get it.

234
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,430
That's your initial position,

235
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,807
but we will want to restructure,

236
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,017
and, uh--

237
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,893
Look, here's where I'm at.

238
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,396
We're not crazy
about the media sector,

239
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,607
we're not crazy about
how your father has treated our relationship,

240
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,776
and our position
is to seek recoupment.

241
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,320
Oh, come on, man.
Fuck off.

242
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,976
Uh, hello?
I'm here.

243
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,062
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

244
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,856
Real world, can we start
to negotiate?

245
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,525
Listen, son,
that's our position.

246
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,611
If the stock drops below 130,

247
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,030
you're in breach
and we want our money back.

248
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,657
OK, fine. Let's keep talking.

249
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,493
Look, if you need
to talk to me,

250
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,661
maybe it's better if we
go through an intermediary.

251
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,498
I'm not a particular fan
of foul language,

252
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,000
and I don't like
to be insulted.

253
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,376
Thank you, good morning.

254
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,132
Oh, boy.

255
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,515
Fuck, that was brutal.
You were listening in?

256
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,768
Of course I was in.
I'm COO. Oof!

257
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,021
Are-Are they for real?
Would they squeeze us?

258
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,482
Well, obviously they could.
Yeah, but why would they?

259
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,317
Relax, man,
it'll be fine.

260
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,070
Uh, no, it fuckin'
necessarily won't. OK?

261
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,030
If this became public,

262
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,533
we could nosedive,
we could death spiral here.

263
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,660
Dude, I was only trying
to be nice.

264
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,830
That was a fucking shitshow,
and you handled it like a moron, is the truth.

265
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,706
Fuck off.

266
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,626
Gents.

267
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,798
Hello.
Uh, Greg Hirsch.

268
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,551
I believe I'm working here
as of today.

269
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,179
OK, what is your job
or job title?

270
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:34,225
Um, job, not entirely sure,
per se.

271
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,103
Uh... I'll find out.

272
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,898
OK, um, I don't
have anything.

273
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:45,194
I was actually personally
appointed by Mr. Logan Roy.

274
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,155
OK. Um...

275
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,909
Um...
Is there anyone else, maybe?

276
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,035
Tom?

277
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,245
Tom.
Last name?

278
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,746
Last name, uh...

279
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,416
Weird, I don't think
I ever got his last--

280
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,627
Uh, T-boss Tom...

281
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,882
Tom? Tom?

282
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,967
Hey! Hey!
Hey.

283
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,510
Can you help me?

284
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,845
Can you help--

285
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,729
OK, Greg. Greg Roy?

286
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,397
That's the--
I'm actually a Hirsch.

287
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,608
I'm not a--
My mom's a Roy, but, uh,

288
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,527
I'm basically a Roy
in all-all but my name.

289
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,575
Wait--
I'll be two minutes.

290
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,410
What? No. No. Shiv--

291
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,954
It has gotten weird.
OK? It has gotten very weird.

292
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,170
How is he?
I don't know.

293
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,797
He might have put on a sock.
Well, that's good, right?

294
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,217
Or he could be lying there dead.
I have no fuckin' idea.

295
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,259
OK, this is--

296
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,719
It's not a good time.

297
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,304
She thinks that
Marcia's poisoning him.

298
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,389
I do not. Apparently,
he doesn't want to see us.

299
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,641
Not including me?

300
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,934
Why would he say that?

301
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,352
Still pissed at you

302
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,354
for not signing up
to his corporate restructure

303
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,813
to make Marcia
queen of the castle?

304
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,149
OK, yeah.
Maybe she's pissed.

305
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,943
Look, did you see him
over the weekend?

306
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,320
No. I heard he wasn't
up to seeing people.

307
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,739
Yeah, no one has seen him
since we took him home from the hospital,

308
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,782
like, Thursday.

309
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,284
I think-Rome? You saw him,
right?

310
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,745
Uh, sure, yeah,
for, like, five minutes.

311
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,873
But he was, um...
he was pretty--

312
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,502
He wasn't really him him,
there were tubes and...

313
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,837
OK, but after that?
Nope.

314
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,381
No one apart from Marcia
has seen him

315
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,966
for the better part of a week.

316
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,510
Four days is not a week.
OK, the majority of the week,

317
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,345
and we're just accepting--
the whole world

318
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,972
is just accepting
this woman's word

319
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,223
that he put on a fucking sock.

320
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,183
Look, relax, OK?

321
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,518
I-It's a process,

322
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,061
we don't want
to rush the recovery...

323
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,105
Oh, right, because
you like playing boss?

324
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,940
That's not...

325
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,360
Please. Can you
go over there?

326
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,695
Shiv, this is--

327
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,155
I literally have something
unmissable.

328
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,662
Later. OK?
I'll try later.

329
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,622
OK?
OK.

330
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,542
Is everything OK?

331
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,503
No. We are on the brink
of total corporate collapse.

332
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,380
Oh, yeah.
Well, that figures.

333
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,465
Well, call me
if you go Lehman, will you?

334
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,175
Might want
some of these chairs.

335
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,909
Morning.

336
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,494
Morning.

337
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,205
Here to help fix the Death Star.

338
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,207
"Grill on the exhaust vent,
guys,

339
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,834
grill on the exhaust vent."

340
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,922
So, my only concern would be,
to brief this meeting,

341
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,008
is it a little too aggressive

342
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,426
for a temporary CEO?

343
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,927
That is a good point.

344
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,804
Yeah, well, we've got
a very aggressive drop

345
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,057
in our share price, so I think
that's appropriate, good?

346
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,100
So brief this wide
and brief it fast, OK?

347
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,019
OK.
Uh, yeah. Great.

348
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,902
All right, all right!

349
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,321
Morning, morning, morning.

350
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,114
Hey, hey, hey.

351
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,116
My people.

352
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,785
It's great to see you all.

353
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,288
You know my brother and I,
CEO and COO...

354
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,333
COO.
Gerri, Karl, Karolina.

355
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,292
Um...

356
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,627
I'm actually gonna stand up,

357
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,920
if that's all right.

358
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,799
My back is fucked.
I have a new trainer, so...

359
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,969
So, I just wanted to
get the gang together early in my tenure

360
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,306
to say, uh... "Yo."

361
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,393
You're probably all wondering
about my dad.

362
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,061
He's doing OK.

363
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,813
Motherfucker.

364
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,648
We're hoping for
a full recovery.

365
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,733
He's, like,
a thousand percent better, though.

366
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,735
He's like a bull
in rhino hide.

367
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,862
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Slow and steady.

368
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,782
This morning
he put on a sock, so...

369
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,036
That's right. Uh, this morning
he tried to put on a sock.

370
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,125
And welcome to Tom Wamsgans,

371
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,627
who was managing Resorts
South and Central

372
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,587
and is now sitting up
with the grownups.

373
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,506
Hey. I just want--
So, what I want to announce

374
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,675
to you all this morning
is a new strategic vision.

375
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,553
We have a great firm here.

376
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,221
Multifaceted.

377
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,848
Parks, cruises,

378
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,852
telecom, live entertainment,
sports--

379
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,687
but at the heart, media.

380
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,523
TV, movies, books, newspapers.

381
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:37,570
And what we're fighting for
is eyeballs, eyeballs which we
convert to our customer base,

382
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,531
eyeballs which we crate up
and sell to advertisers.

383
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:44,201
Right? And bottom line,
we're losing...

384
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,037
to monopolistic disruptors.

385
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,290
Alphabet, Facebook...

386
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,375
Internet.
Fucking game-changer, man.

387
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,295
That's right, the internet.
Internet.

388
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,716
But, uh, we are still just--
just-in a position

389
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,552
to leverage our brands into
something in the new landscape.

390
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,013
But if we don't,
we're gonna be like

391
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,725
the biggest fuckin' horse trader
in Detroit, 1909. OK?

392
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,561
We need
a more dynamic strategy.

393
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,230
Now, let's call it,
for the sake of clarity,

394
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,733
the Strategy
of a Thousand Lifeboats.

395
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,819
Vaulter is a lifeboat,

396
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,906
ATN Citizens is a lifeboat.

397
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,241
There are no bad lifeboats.

398
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,076
VR could be a lifeboat.

399
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,912
VR's a bubble,

400
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,498
but yeah. No bad ideas.

401
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,916
Porn could be a lifeboat.

402
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,085
Except that.
That's a bad lifeboat.

403
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,255
Hey, thanks, Rome.

404
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,840
Look, this isn't a brainstorm,

405
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,384
all I'm saying,
everyone's invited. OK?

406
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,261
I want each and every one of you

407
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,639
to be innovating, challenging,

408
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,766
being bold, being disruptive,

409
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,186
bringing me new, original,
multiplatform content.

410
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,105
Bring me more
in the interactive and digital space.

411
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,774
Bring me franchiseable IP.

412
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,360
Bring me a thousand lifeboats.

413
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,612
Bring me a fucking armada
of eyeballs.

414
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,657
Because steady as she goes
hits the iceberg.

415
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,536
All right.
Thanks, everyone.

416
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,121
Lifeboats! Whoo!

417
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,630
Just had to say,
that was great. Kudos.

418
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,258
Always here if you need
a friendly ear,

419
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,926
Lord Vader.

420
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,469
Just get shit moving
at Parks.

421
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,804
Yes.
Yeah, Tom?

422
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,138
It's stagnant,

423
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,391
so shake that fuckin' tree,
C3PO.

424
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,810
Shakin' the tree.
Shakin' the tree.

425
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,937
Shakin' it big time.

426
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,108
Uh, Fiona.
Walk with me.

427
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,318
Can you send flowers to Rava?

428
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,821
Nice, but, you know,
not ridiculous.

429
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,699
They should smell like flowers,
not desperation.

430
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,367
Oh, and Fi, talk to Jess,

431
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,036
I might want to throw
a couple of items up on the internal.

432
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,997
Not a big deal,
couple of TED talks.

433
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,667
Maybe a documentary
on the Epic of Gilgamesh, I'm thinking?

434
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,503
You know,
it's the first story, archetypal quest shit.

435
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,214
Because what are we
if not storytellers?

436
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,092
Hey. Talk to me.

437
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,427
Down three points,

438
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,012
and there's an AP headline

439
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,598
"CEO tells staff
Waystar headed for iceberg."

440
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,351
Not iceberg, lifeboats.
I said lifeboats, not iceberg!

441
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,770
Jesus! Karolina.
That's what we're pushing.

442
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,272
Push harder.
Will do.

443
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,482
I want to talk options
to you, OK?

444
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,943
I've got some thoughts
I've been working on for a long time--

445
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,779
OK, I don't want the sloppy seconds, Gerri.
I'm taking five to think big.

446
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,781
Ken, these are modeled
and thought through--

447
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,408
And rejected.

448
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,868
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm talking a walk,

449
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,202
I need to get
some altitude on this.

450
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,579
I'll be back.

451
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:44,131
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.

452
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,550
The thing about capitalism is,
yeah, sure,

453
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,051
it's got its issues,
but fuck me--

454
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,345
this is a piece of shit chain
on a stretch of nothing,

455
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,808
but this-this is the most delicious thing 
anyone's ever fucking tasted.

456
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,935
Oh, my God. Thank you.

457
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,354
Thank you.
So dude, listen.

458
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,523
Mm-hmm?
I could do with a read

459
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,067
from someone without
a dog in the fight.

460
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,445
Actually, I gotta
talk to you about something, too.

461
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,696
This is tight.

462
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,698
This is absolutely
just us, OK?

463
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,116
Because a leak kills me.

464
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,410
Right.
This is about Rava.

465
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,328
For a pal.
Rava?

466
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,621
Yeah, it's a mutual friend,

467
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,165
and they want to know
is it cool,

468
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,959
or you still hankerin'
for a wankerin'?

469
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,670
I don't have time for this.

470
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,630
I mean, who-who's asking?

471
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,924
What?
I can't say.

472
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,135
But they just want
to know if it's an issue.

473
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,054
Like who, fuckin' Paul?

474
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:58,599
Well, if you're asking,
I'm assuming it's a fucking issue.

475
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,352
No, I mean, look,
we're separated, you know?

476
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,688
Whatever.
Free agents.

477
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,607
Yeah. No, I get it.

478
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,775
I'm gonna have another.

479
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,735
You know, if you
eat it fast enough

480
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,361
it actually burns off
the calories.

481
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,362
It's like a loophole.

482
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,656
Can I have another, please?

483
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,201
So, listen,
when I took over...

484
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:21,080
found out Dad
took out a huge loan

485
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,957
a decade ago. Secret.
Through the holding company.

486
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,292
Are you serious?

487
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,376
Secured against
the family's stake

488
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,669
in the public firm.

489
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,046
Fuck. Dude.

490
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,173
Yeah. Now the stock
is getting ready to breach,

491
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,175
and the bank are...
Yeah, I know, I saw the price.

492
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,261
It's brutal.
Who's the bank?

493
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,555
Mm-hmm. I'm just
gonna do this.

494
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,682
Dude...

495
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,726
we're not at Buckley
anymore. Jesus.

496
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,061
It's fine.

497
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,647
So, these guys
have your dick in a vise.

498
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,900
Yes. Thank you, Stewy.

499
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,653
Mm-hmm.
Can I have your take?

500
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,405
Well, number one,
you boost the price.

501
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,407
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
OK.

502
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,451
I'm trying.
OK.

503
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,496
How's it gonna play
for us to refinance?

504
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,164
Honestly? Not great.

505
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:08,335
Why won't your original bank
step up? Not good.

506
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,380
People don't love the sector,
and they don't love the fucking firm.

507
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,090
It's ramshackle, is the view.

508
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:17,094
And bro,
they don't love... you.

509
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,637
It's tough.

510
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,361
Ah, fuck it.

511
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,784
OK! I am open for business.

512
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,619
You know, one thing occurs.

513
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,289
Just blue sky,
wouldn't happen in a million years,

514
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,332
but what if

515
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,418
we came in,

516
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,379
took the whole thing
off your family's hands?

517
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,676
Uh, well, obviously no,

518
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,971
fuck off, how dare you,
I'm so insulted, et cetera.

519
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,141
Of course. But you
and Roman and Shiv,

520
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,603
you're gonna do that thing
forever? No.

521
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,814
You all have the chance
to be fucking...

522
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,443
fucking, like,
ugly petro-ruble rich.

523
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,861
You can do anything.

524
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,070
You can go into tech,

525
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,906
Shiv can do her politics
or whatever,

526
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,867
and Roman can, you know,
snort his body weight.

527
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,328
And you all live
unhappily ever after.

528
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,787
Uh-huh. Thanks, Stewy.

529
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,205
Just think about it.

530
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,176
Can I get the senior team
together tomorrow

531
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,844
for a reorientation?

532
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,263
Shakin' the tree, folks,
shakin' the tree.

533
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,683
Excuse me.

534
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,102
Greg? Are you kidding?

535
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,396
Hey, Tom.

536
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,814
Forgive me, but, uh...

537
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,775
we talkin' to each other
on the poop deck

538
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,319
of a majestic schooner?

539
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:01,031
Is the salty brine
stinging my weather-beaten face?

540
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,699
No?

541
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,451
Then why the fuck
are you wearing

542
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,577
a pair of deck shoes, man?

543
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,913
Oh-Yeah-No, well,

544
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,541
my credit card got maxed out,
I'm staying in a youth hostel

545
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,795
on, like, $80 a day--
Jesus. How squalid.

546
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,463
Dude, are you
carrying dog shit?

547
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,176
No-No, it's, uh...

548
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,220
it's free, right?

549
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,388
Is that cool? I mean,

550
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,682
I don't wanna be melodramatic,

551
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,477
but my body is growing weak
due to a lack of sustenance.

552
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,396
But in a dog poop baggie?

553
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,939
Yeah, I have
a bunch of 'em

554
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,941
from back home--
Greg, that's disgusting.

555
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,609
Not really.

556
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,237
It's not like
they pre-poop them
or something,

557
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,531
like, it's not like--
they're just bags, really.

558
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,241
It's just a mental barrier.

559
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,327
A pair of cap-toe Oxfords,
Crockett &amp; Jones, ASAP.

560
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,746
Lucinda, can we figure out
where we might put

561
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,665
the talented Mr. Greg?

562
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,066
Hey.
Hey.

563
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,819
Nathaniel.
Siobhan.

564
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,904
How have you been?

565
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,282
Uh, yeah, good.
Busy.

566
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,075
Right.

567
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,620
So, is this...?

568
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,122
Work.

569
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,375
OK. Of course.
Yeah.

570
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,502
Wha-What?
Work.

571
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:41,381
A little work meeting
on the bed of a four-star hotel.

572
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,841
Get your mind
out of the gutter.

573
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,801
OK.

574
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:48,597
How's it goin'
workin' with... Joyce?

575
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,184
That tall glass of tepid water
from Albany.

576
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,685
It's great. Yeah.

577
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,980
How's the, uh,
poor man's Fidel Castro?

578
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,733
Senior senator from
the state of 1975.

579
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,651
How's that
workin' out for ya?

580
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,403
Better. Zing!

581
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,284
I wondered if you
could do me a favor.

582
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,702
Do I owe you a favor?

583
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:11,995
Yeah, 'cause I deigned
to date you.

584
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,790
You deigned.
That's nice.

585
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,541
And I thought
we were gonna be friends.

586
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,294
Sure. I wanna be friends.

587
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,712
Good.

588
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,881
I need a background check
on somebody.

589
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,717
Well, that might cause
some ethical issues.

590
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:29,012
'Cause there's a world
where my guy and your gal

591
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,932
end up in the mud wrestling
for the Democratic nomination.

592
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,850
No, it's not political.

593
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:38,105
I need background on someone
off the record.

594
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,941
Uh, Marcia.
Marcia.

595
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,943
The wicked stepmother.
Yeah.

596
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,112
It occurred to me
a few years too late

597
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,780
that I don't really
know anything about her.

598
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,198
So... just due diligence.

599
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,575
OK?
Well, um,

600
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,162
I know a really horrible guy

601
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,665
who's incredibly expensive.

602
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,209
OK. Yeah,
that sounds great. OK.

603
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,212
All goes through you?
Yes, milady.

604
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,216
OK.

605
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,887
"Deigned."
Yeah.

606
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,722
Did you see the women
I dated after you?

607
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,766
Yeah. They only dated you
because you dated me.

608
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,019
They were like,
"Oh, I guess he must have something."

609
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,734
Waystar diversity
and harassment policy.

610
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,070
Waystar Royco has worked hard
to develop a tolerant

611
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,572
and respectful workplace.

612
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,073
The company
is strongly committed

613
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,116
to making employment decisions

614
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,909
based on valid requirements

615
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:36,413
and without regards to race,
religion, national origin,

616
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,081
ancestry, gender,
gender identity,

617
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,749
gender expression,
sex preference,

618
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:43,044
sexual orientation,
physical or mental disability,

619
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,088
military status,
marital status,

620
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,215
or any other status as is
protected by applicable law.

621
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,426
Where the law requires
affirmative action programs,

622
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,596
the company will strive
to comply with the provisions of those laws.

623
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,181
Thank you for your attention.

624
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:58,059
Welcome to your new future
at Waystar Royco.

625
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,437
Feel it!

626
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,440
Hey. Where we at?
Hey.

627
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,817
We're down two more points.
Fuck.

628
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,486
Listen, Sandy Furness is here.

629
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,865
What do you mean?
I mean, he's here,

630
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,491
in the building.
He can't do that.

631
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,703
Fucking Pepsi doesn't just
drop in to see Coke.

632
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,246
Put him where
no one can see him.

633
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,207
South tank. I'm right here.

634
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,961
Sharks are circling.

635
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:27,464
Your father
would shoot him on sight.

636
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,382
You know, I don't need
to hear what my father would do right now.

637
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,468
OK? He's not here.
Right.

638
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,886
I'm gonna handle it.
He's not here.

639
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,181
Mr. Furness, what a surprise.

640
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,642
So kind of you to drop by.
Oh, not at all.

641
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,645
I just came to say
how sorry I was to hear about your dad.

642
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,939
Well, it's so kind of you
to do it in person

643
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,315
when you could have just called.

644
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,816
Thank you.

645
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,611
Well, I hope I didn't send
the birds a-tweeting,

646
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,656
what with all
the uncertainty and whatnot.

647
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,699
We'll make sure people know
it's just friendly.

648
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,993
And you'll give your dad
my best, tell him I stopped by?

649
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,495
Of course. Sure.

650
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:02,457
Maybe when that news is, uh...
less likely to kill him.

651
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,794
OK, well,

652
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,255
thank you. I do--
I appreciate this.

653
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,756
Oh, and just to say,

654
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,926
if, um, I can give you
any advice,

655
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,844
I'm just watching
the wheels nowadays,

656
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,680
so if you want to
run anything by me

657
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,515
as an honest broker,
use me.

658
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,517
A mentor.

659
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,019
That is a very kind offer.

660
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:26,523
Well, there's probably
a million options with our two firms.

661
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:30,402
Swaps, acquisitions,
cooperative interactions.

662
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,861
You know, smart stuff

663
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:34,531
only a young man like you
can conceive of.

664
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,701
Well, Sandy,

665
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,703
you've been pretty smart.

666
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,788
Smarter than the regulators,
anyway.

667
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,874
Tell you what's smart:
Vaulter.

668
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,002
I don't care
what the wise apples say.

669
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,801
Well, uh, I've got a thing.

670
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,431
Hey, Jess, will you
take Mr. Furness down?

671
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,727
Look at you. Right in the eye
of the raging storm and...

672
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,937
and cool as a cucumber.

673
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,275
Stay strong.
Stay in touch.

674
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,112
Um...

675
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,997
Yeah.
What happened?

676
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,666
He said I was
dead in the water without him

677
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,209
and tried
to finger-bang me.

678
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,670
What'd you say?

679
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,048
Said I'd rather
eat my own shit.

680
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,178
Have you heard?
What?

681
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,681
Stock's gone below 130.

682
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,286
You know sometimes
you leave the party

683
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,747
and you wonder what everyone's
saying about you?

684
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,125
With me it's usually
"Who's that young Han Solo

685
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,960
and how do I get his dick
in my ass?"

686
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,922
Like, I know
what they say about me.

687
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,840
What?

688
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,550
That. See that?

689
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,095
That's how much
people don't like me.

690
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,222
Hey, that's me too.
Don't leave me out.

691
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,474
The truth is,

692
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,060
we call their bluff,
which may not be a bluff,

693
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,938
and the debt becomes public,
and we lose control.

694
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,524
Or we get the stock up,
which we can't,

695
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,484
because we can't "magic" that,

696
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,194
or we pay the bank back,

697
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,697
which, I mean,
to realize that much cash...

698
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,740
stock sell-down,
which is horrible.

699
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,033
There is no good option.

700
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,494
Can I suggest something?
Yeah?

701
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,496
Can I suggest we all
take our shirts off?

702
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,872
OK. Kendall?

703
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,500
They can write
a fucking algorithm

704
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,585
to run this place,
but that's not the answer.

705
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,379
That's not us.

706
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,173
So... break shit up.

707
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,300
Like, just disrupt.

708
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,554
What are you doing?

709
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,639
Takin' my shirt off.
That's all.

710
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,101
Ken, make him
put his shirt on.

711
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,312
I don't-uh, I don't--

712
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:15,191
I don't fuckin' know. I--
Shirt off.

713
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,192
Shirt off.

714
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,694
Shirts off.

715
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,487
Shirts off.

716
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,780
How about your jacket off?

717
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,866
Come on, man.

718
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,201
Yeah, all right. All right.

719
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,327
Good.

720
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,413
That's all. Let's go.

721
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,750
OK.
So...

722
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:35,962
worst position, we sell down
the stock, we survive.

723
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,131
Maybe we cut a title or two
from physical production,

724
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,466
newspaper-wise.
Online only.

725
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,217
I like that.

726
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,845
That is a $20 million solution
to a billion dollar problem.

727
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,056
Yeah, but it's the right 
direction of travel.
That feels right to me.

728
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,685
If you want stuff that works
for the price: layoffs.

729
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,438
Yum-yum. Blood! Yes!

730
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,648
See? Shirts-off shit.

731
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,359
I guess it could be a package.
Layoffs, sell-offs.

732
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,986
Structured retreat?

733
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,530
Well, yeah,
but with a philosophy.

734
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,199
OK.
Yeah.

735
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,118
OK? I mean,
OK.

736
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:10,789
I guess we just have
to ask or, you know, tell Dad.

737
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,088
Hey, guys.

738
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,090
Finally.
Hi.

739
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,426
Hey, sweetie. Hi.

740
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,636
What's up, slugger?

741
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,429
Hey.
Hey.

742
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,889
Thanks for joining us.

743
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,349
Actually,
I can't stay long.

744
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,642
Apparently goes for us, too.

745
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,352
Aunt Marcia
won't let us see Grandpa.

746
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,437
Right, kids?
Huh.

747
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,860
Hey, Marcia.
Kendall.

748
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,696
How are you?

749
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,073
Good.
Good.

750
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,284
How's he doing?
Is he OK?

751
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,453
He's improving.
He's really improving.

752
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,830
Great.
Yeah.

753
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,374
'Cause I should probably
let him know something.

754
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,917
He's resting.

755
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,669
I'm sorry,
it's not a good time.

756
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,170
OK.

757
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,716
Well, it's just
when my assistant called--

758
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,468
She spoke with Joan, not me.

759
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,220
Got it.
Yeah.

760
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:11,641
Well, uh, let him know,
will you, that I stopped by,

761
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,561
wanted to talk to him,
keep him abreast of moves?

762
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:18,314
If you like, you can tell me,
I'll pass it on.

763
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,316
Um...

764
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,195
will you just tell him
that we're...

765
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:28,867
um, we're retreating,
tactically.

766
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,996
Well, that doesn't
sound right.

767
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,083
Not retreating, quite, but...

768
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,586
It's hard to explain.

769
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,088
I'm sure you're doing
the right thing.

770
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:47,093
OK, thanks. See you soon.
See you.

771
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,401
So, Stewy?
Mm-hmm?

772
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,779
You know how, like,
everyone hates you?

773
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,532
Well, no, that's not
something I'm aware of.

774
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:10,783
Oh, sure. They do.

775
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,202
Private equity,
getting your meat hooks in,

776
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:17,373
chiseling your profit
like a vampire locust fuck.

777
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,584
What is this?
Is this a roast?

778
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,210
Because I have shit to do.

779
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,795
I've had an idea.
OK.

780
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,465
How about instead of taking us over,
you give me $4 billion?

781
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:29,093
I stay boss,

782
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,679
you stop raiding
shitty companies for scraps,

783
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:35,224
you invest, for once,
in a blue-chip corporation,

784
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,894
one that is currently,
you know, undervalued

785
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,896
because of some
unfounded concerns

786
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,565
about its leadership, i. e.,
Little Lord Fuckleroy here,

787
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,276
the story twists...
happy ending for all.

788
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,111
Oh ho ho!

789
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,741
OK. Full disclosure?
Yeah.

790
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,744
I have a hangover.
And it's bigger than normal.

791
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,996
Why don't we do what we did
back in the day,

792
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,499
let's go to the bathroom,
have a little sumthin'-sumthin',

793
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,043
just knock out a few ideas,
just bash 'em out.

794
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,128
No. Not for me.
Of course.

795
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,005
Yeah, yeah, of course.

796
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,675
Do you mind if I have, like,
just like a taste of it?

797
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,928
Really, dude?

798
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,973
Ooh.

799
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,849
Yeah. Mm-kay.

800
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,726
Are you done?
Uh, no.

801
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,271
Obviously, I don't generally
take a minority stake in a public company.

802
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:25,775
Yeah, obviously,
because you're a parasite.

803
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,151
Mm-hmm.

804
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,195
How about for once
you make things bigger?

805
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,072
You know,
with your old pal?

806
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,077
Are you done?
Yeah.

807
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,956
Well, I can't even begin
to think about this.

808
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,792
But if I could...

809
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,961
to sell it,
I'm gonna need voting stock.

810
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,131
As long as the family
maintain control?

811
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:51,300
Well, effective control.
I'm also gonna need a board seat.

812
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,387
Oh, I'd force it on you,
dude. For the optics.

813
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,433
Shit hot new CEO
has some hot shit new money for investment.

814
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,892
New generation.

815
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,853
I keep the debt
out of the news.

816
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,231
Fuckin' sisters doin' it
for theyselves.

817
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:10,111
I'm not necessarily
totally opposed to this notion.

818
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,280
That's right, and luckily
I speak Stewy,

819
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,366
and that's Stewy for
"I have a fuckin' raging hard-on for this."

820
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,785
Greg. Come on, buddy.

821
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,329
First meeting of
the senior management cadre.

822
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,664
Uh-huh.
Yeah, come on.

823
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,458
Uh, great. Great stuff.
Great.

824
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,003
You know, I was lookin' through
employee emails,

825
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,337
which, by the way,
is totally legal,

826
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,382
and, uh, does my breath smell?

827
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,468
Honestly?

828
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,179
No, no. No, I mean,
it smells of breath,

829
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,472
but--

830
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,348
You know, there's
too much drift in Parks.

831
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,892
I'm gonna shake that tree.

832
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,352
I might punch-bag you
a little, is that cool?

833
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,021
Sure. As in,

834
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,856
like, punch-Yeah.

835
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:47,899
Morning, people.

836
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,693
Kick-off. Ahem.

837
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,236
Here's a question.

838
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,741
Here we are, out in
the Theme Park Division,

839
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,535
but tell me this:

840
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,331
if you could really do anything,
professionally,

841
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,459
and work anywhere,
where would that be?

842
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,174
Excuse me.

843
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,180
Uh-huh. Oh, no. Shiv.

844
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,974
I'm in the middle
of the first m-meeting.

845
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,937
Well, it's hard--

846
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,440
Connor's flying in?

847
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,401
OK. OK.

848
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:33,528
All right, bye. Right.

849
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,240
Fuck!

850
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,118
You background checked her?
Yeah, no need to tell Ken.

851
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,536
Is that legal?

852
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,704
You don't need to know.

853
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,040
Um, hey...

854
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,835
can anybody do that on anybody?

855
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:52,004
OK, so, first husband,
Lebanese businessman.

856
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:53,756
Yeah, I remember.
Right.

857
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,592
They had the high life in Paris,
lot of parties, with pols,

858
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:59,720
and writers, and also
a lot of shitbags and slimeballs

859
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,640
and arms dealers, oil guys.
Wow.

860
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,935
And further back?
Well, further back...

861
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,478
further back is complicated.

862
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:08,813
There's no leads.

863
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,940
What?
Yeah.

864
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,609
Is that...
Weird? Yes.

865
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,777
Ominous, yes.
Yeah.

866
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,028
It's apparently
a little weird.

867
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,613
And there are
two possibilities.

868
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,407
Either she came
from kind of nowhere,

869
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,741
Tripoli, Lebanon,

870
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,452
turns up in Paris,
age 31,

871
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:24,787
a publishing assistant,

872
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,414
and then just marries this guy.

873
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,707
Fine.
Or.

874
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,043
Or... cleanup job.

875
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,462
Oh! Hey, Marcia.

876
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,006
Great impression of a cuckoo.

877
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,465
Door opens, and there you are.

878
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,801
Hello, everybody.
Hi.

879
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:42,138
Yeah, hi. This is Connor,
Logan's firstborn son, you remember him?

880
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,973
And this is Tom, my partner,
and together

881
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,726
they're over 12 feet
of We Would Like To See Him, Please.

882
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,978
Are you trying to force entry,
is that it?

883
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,813
Oh, boy. I thought
we were just stopping by.

884
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:53,482
I usually try to avoid confrontation.
Let's all breathe.

885
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,860
He simply isn't
up to visitors.

886
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,486
Is this about me signing
some pieces of paper? Or...

887
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,863
Oh, please, Shiv.

888
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,449
It's very difficult as it is.

889
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,159
Oh, the fuckin' waterworks?

890
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,119
Is that it?
You're gonna cry now? Please.

891
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,666
Siobhan.

892
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,502
I can't believe
you would try and stop me seeing my father.

893
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,422
And I can't believe
you will try against his wishes.

894
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,721
Hi. Dad.

895
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,683
Hey.

896
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:28,935
Can you?

897
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,190
Hey.

898
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,983
How are you feeling?

899
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,653
Uh, uhh-uhh--

900
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,529
Yeah?

901
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,032
You're looking good.
You're-You look better.

902
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:48,537
So, hey, Tom and I
are gonna move here, we think.

903
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:51,457
More permanently.
Less time in D. C.

904
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,168
Oh, and we're engaged.

905
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,171
Um, he wanted to ask you.

906
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,176
I love you.

907
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,431
I love you too.

908
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,153
Ohhh.

909
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,995
I'm gonna...
go get Joan. OK?

910
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,122
It's-It's fine.

911
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,500
I-I'll be back.

912
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,754
How is Mr. Roy?
Yeah. He--

913
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,548
Ohh.

914
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,142
Everything OK?

915
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,477
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

916
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,229
He's looking better.

917
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,690
Morning isn't usually
a good time.

918
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,109
You know, the morphine,
he gets confused.

919
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,945
He doesn't like you all to
see him when he's not himself.

920
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:05,448
Uh-huh. Yeah,
he wasn't himself.

921
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,615
Right.
So...

922
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:10,202
Shiv, I'm a private person.

923
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,121
Not all of us
are born into good ease.

924
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,456
OK.

925
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,124
So if you want to know
anything about me,

926
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,418
just ask me,
and I will tell you.

927
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,297
Uh-huh.

928
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,673
Hey, Siobhan,
how's Pop?

929
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,343
Yeah. Yeah, no, he's good.

930
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,553
OK, bye.
He's tired.

931
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,561
Good afternoon.

932
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,272
Thanks for making time for us,
Mr. Polk.

933
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,940
Not at all.

934
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,151
We've been looking
at the terms we can offer,

935
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,111
I think you've seen
what we've put together.

936
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,155
I have. I have.

937
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,240
It's a very brutal structure.

938
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:49,992
Well, these are the terms

939
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,203
we think we can offer
right now.

940
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,288
I mean, I don't know,

941
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,498
the margin you're making,

942
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,416
you might even say you were...

943
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,544
well, I mean,
"extortion" is an ugly word,

944
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:04,465
but, you know, so is
"buzz saw castration."

945
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,510
Look, I think we should
keep things professional, don't you?

946
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,011
Uh-huh. Sure. Sure.

947
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:13,349
And professionally,
we're going to repay.

948
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,518
As in...?
We're good.

949
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,520
Everything's golden.
We don't need you.

950
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,605
This can all stay private,
and I'll be looking elsewhere

951
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,399
for a banking partner
as we go supersonic.

952
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,525
Good-bye.

953
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,318
Mr. Roy--
And fuck you.

954
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,620
Have you been here?
No.

955
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,331
It's super-good.
I'm thinking...

956
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,834
tout le lapin...

957
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,460
"all of the rabbit."

958
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:44,004
All of it.
Well, that's my question,

959
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,965
is when they say
"all of the rabbit,"

960
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,676
do they mean, like,
all of the rabbit?

961
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,262
I mean, it can't be,
like, all of it.

962
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,183
So, is this the Stewy money
we're celebrating?

963
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,768
Because I saw the news.

964
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,396
Well, I wouldn't say
that I'm the man,

965
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:04,316
but if there were a man,
hypothetically,

966
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,069
he might look a lot like me.

967
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,739
Yeah, I solved the debt issue
with private equity money.

968
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:14,160
I'm very happy for you.
Yeah. Well...

969
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,581
...the thing is, all of that,

970
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,958
it's made me
think about everything,

971
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,670
and, um...well, you know,

972
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,047
like, here's where I'm at.

973
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,177
I love you.

974
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,096
OK.

975
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,974
Well, thank you. Noted.

976
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,936
That's it? Come on.
That's--

977
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,563
"And... I..."
Uh, Ken.

978
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:47,026
OK. Uh, I'm not sure
that I love you.

979
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,822
Yeah, you do.

980
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,782
Fuck you.

981
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,869
Look, you want us
to live separately, right?

982
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,747
We don't know why right now,
you say you do.

983
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,832
Now, that makes me unhappy.

984
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,626
On the other hand, you claim,

985
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,461
and of course
I don't believe you,

986
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,963
that us being together
will make you unhappy.

987
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:11,634
So one of us
is going to be unhappy.

988
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,011
I just don't see
why it has to be me.

989
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:18,015
Wow. I-I cannot argue
with that logic.

990
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,476
No, it's, like,
impenetrable logic.

991
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,977
It's the argument
of a psychopath.

992
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,146
A psychopath who might,

993
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,775
hypothetically, be the man.

994
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,485
Who loves you.
Mm-hmm.

995
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,237
Fuck you.

996
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,853
We are not breaking up.

997
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:07,147
Yes. We are. I--

998
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:13,362
We are not breaking up.
Yes, we are.

999
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,614
Sorry.

1000
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,703
We are not. Not.
Yes, we are.

1001
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,831
No!
Yes! Yes!

1002
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,628
We are not breaking up.
We fucking are.

1003
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,005
Good mornin'.

1004
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,923
So, did you want
to work out down here?

1005
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,634
Want me to take
my car to the park,
we can parkour it?

1006
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,886
Well, here's the thing, Brex.

1007
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,638
I can't do shit, really,

1008
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:42,266
because my back
has been fucked
since Monday.

1009
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,851
Fucked how?

1010
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,603
Well, I assume
you're insured?

1011
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:49,023
I mean, I do big,
big shit here,
every day,

1012
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:53,652
so losing even
a quarter of a percent
of my operating capacity,

1013
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,821
that has million dollar
implications.

1014
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,700
So I'm thinkin'
maybe a test case,

1015
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,621
I throw three or four dozen
white-shoe lawyers at you

1016
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:07,666
and see what it would be like
to actually physically
destroy someone.

1017
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,753
Dude, I don't know
what happened,

1018
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,588
but I'm sure I can fix it.

1019
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,006
Mm-hmm.

1020
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,927
Fuck you.

1021
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,554
Oh, fuck you, dude!

1022
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,181
Jeez, look at you.
Look at your face!

1023
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,223
You're a piece of shit.

1024
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,684
Yeah.

1025
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:28,812
But, uh, no,
I'm just sayin'

1026
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,649
you need to take this
more seriously.

1027
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,359
OK.

1028
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:43,911
OK.

1029
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:46,914
I have to go.

1030
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,626
What about Malaya,
can't she--?

1031
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,503
No. Iverson will freak out.

1032
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,971
Hey, Rava.
What?

1033
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:05,182
Why don't we just do it all?

1034
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,936
You know? Back together?

1035
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,398
Uh... let's talk later?

1036
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,902
What does that mean?

1037
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,488
Hey.

1038
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,993
That was nice, right?

1039
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,748
Nevertheless.
What?

1040
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,253
Look, I, um...

1041
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:39,174
I-I don't know.
I don't know.

1042
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,884
Maybe it's, um, um-

1043
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,514
Shit. It's like-
It's like you're moving on,

1044
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,392
and maybe that makes me feel OK
about moving on too.

1045
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,687
No. I'm not moving on. Rava.

1046
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,147
That's bullshit.

1047
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,567
I got a lawyer.

1048
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,736
He's nice.

1049
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:01,697
Let's just keep this all
really, really nice, OK?

1050
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,632
Marcia?
Everything all right?

1051
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:23,218
Kendall, you father
would like to see you.

1052
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:46,325
...a dozen troops swarmed
the drugs farm from the air,

1053
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,577
descending from helicopters,
while another unit

1054
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,120
entered on foot.

1055
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,997
It's claimed
the drug trafficking ring

1056
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,208
had been in existence
for over three years...

1057
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,294
Hey. Look at you.

1058
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,965
Sitting up.

1059
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,176
Fuckin' watchin' the news.

1060
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:17,523
It's good to see you, Dad.

1061
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,238
Well...

1062
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,114
you understand
after you went down,

1063
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:28,283
the stock tanked.

1064
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,661
I mean, you should be flattered,
I guess.

1065
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,707
We had some
pretty shitty options.

1066
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,712
I mean, you took a gamble
on that loan.

1067
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,425
But I found us
a private equity solution.

1068
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:46,885
So...

1069
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,348
I tried consulting you,
but-

1070
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:54,935
People like the shape of this.

1071
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:58,188
Karolina says there's
positive analyst noise.

1072
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,817
We are at 36%,

1073
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,570
with effective control,

1074
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,698
plus a war chest
to make some moves.

1075
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,783
We're-
We're in good shape, Dad.

1076
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,202
You just keep
getting better.

1077
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,204
I got this.

1078
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:15,831
Fuginidiot.

1079
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,624
Dad?

1080
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,963
Hey, can I get you something?

1081
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,134
You...

1082
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,178
are...

1083
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,597
fuh...

1084
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,604
...fucking idiot.

1085
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,098
Hi.

1086
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,016
I think, uh...
