1
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,355
CHIME

2
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,716
(Man) Ladies and gentlemen,
the seatbelt light has been switched off.

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,870
You are now free
to move around the cabin.

4
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,475
We've reached cruising altitude
and are flying over the French Alps.

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,636
Sorry, man.

6
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,948
It's nothing to do with you!
It's the vibrations, innit?

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,519
Mm, yeah.

8
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,269
Fuck off, homo.

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,512
- You gonna be this horny the whole trip?
- Just wait till we get there. Oh, man.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,310
Those Russian peasant babes will do anything
for some Levi's and a Big Mac!

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,356
OK, everyone. Listen up.

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,992
Right, I want you all to remember
that this is <i>not</i> a holiday, OK?

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,437
This is your chance to nail
your module one history coursework -

14
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,080
post-Soviet industrial Russia.

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,479
It's a chance of a lifetime, gang.

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,437
Whoopee (!)

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,435
Now, this isn't just education, yeah?
It's <i>total</i> education.

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,353
Total piss up.

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,273
Uh, no, no, no, no.
There'll be no "piss up", OK?

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,557
We're gonna work hard,
understanding the culture and history

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,030
of Mokshovkov in the Mordovian Republic
of the Russian Federation.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,510
OK? We're gonna see
the <i>real</i> Russia, yeah?

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,276
The wild and desolate land that
Napoleon and Hitler failed to tame.

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,990
This is adventure, yeah?
This is living, breathing history.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,672
Who's with me?

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,317
Thank you, sir. I was addressing
history students only.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,393
- This trip will blow their minds, and yours.
- Great.

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,552
Oi, An, An.
Where'd you hide the drugs, then?

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,349
- I thought you were bringing them.
- No. You were gonna put 'em in your turban.

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,159
I don't wear a turban, Chris.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,071
I thought you were gonna
get one especially!

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,232
Don't panic, boys.
We've got a back-up plan.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,033
Urgh, not up his arse?

34
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,835
(Jal) Christ.

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,909
(Michelle) Jeez.

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,558
MAGNETIC HUMMING

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,559
HUMMING

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,469
Thanks.

39
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,635
ALARM

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,755
SOLDIER SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,552
What's happening?

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,629
SHOUTING

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,438
They think he's a fucking terrorist?

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,114
- Where they gonna take me?
- (Angie) Do something.

45
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,475
- Right, OK. Leave it to me.
- Tom, maybe I should...

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,198
No, no, no. <i>I'm</i> trip leader.

47
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,192
If anyone's gonna be anally searched,
it should be me.

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,396
Trip leader. Let me through.

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,119
KNOCKS ON DOOR

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,119
(Woman) Nyet!

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,508
(Anwar) Get the fuck off me!

52
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,275
No, sorry, sorry. Listen, listen!
That boy is in my charge

53
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,557
and I can give you
my personal guarantee that...

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,595
Ah.

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,240
Oh, I see. OK.

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,550
No, no, no.
I've given you everything.

57
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,551
< Ahh! There's nothing fucking up there!

58
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,631
No... OK, OK, OK.

59
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,719
That's totally stereotyping.
You gonna let them get away with it?

60
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,715
Now what?

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,392
Just walk on.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,711
I'm trying - they just look
so disappointed I'm not a terrorist.

63
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,270
Well, you're a very dull Muslim,
Anwar. Very dull indeed.

64
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,191
ROAR OF AIRPLANE ENGINES

65
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,158
Excuse me.

66
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,589
Uh, hello, excuse me.

67
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,956
Hello, hi.
Uh, we're looking for our bus.

68
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,478
Um, we had an arrangement,
uh, for a bus to, uh, Mokshokov.

69
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,677
- Mokshokov?
- Um... How can I put this? Um...

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,639
- We <i>ordered a bus.</i>
- Ahh!

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,950
SPEAKS RUSSIAN

72
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,190
REPLIES IN RUSSIAN

73
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,074
Ugh. Bet you never thought
you'd be doing this last week, eh?

74
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,235
No.

75
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,870
Fucking hell.
This place better be good.

76
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,033
My hair is destroyed.
I need a shower and a decent hairdryer.

77
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,396
Oh, great, Tom.
We're staying in a fucking prison.

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,072
Don't judge a book by its cover.

79
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,278
This trip is all about understanding
other people's culture.

80
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,509
Hello!

81
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,079
(Speaks Russian) Dobry den.

82
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,832
- Ya, Tom Barkley. And you are...
- Irene Kovskaya. Translator.

83
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,514
Come! I lock you in!

84
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,079
WOLF HOWLS

85
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,036
OK, it's two to a room.

86
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,156
So pair up, people!

87
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,233
Raas! Russia's big, bruv!
Me's gonna be hyped up.

88
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,836
No, it's same sex only, I'm afraid.
So rearrange yourselves, yep.

89
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,558
DISAPPOINTED GROANS

90
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,198
Spoilsport.

91
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,191
Come, come.

92
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,913
- And we are going to be roomies, I'm afraid.
- What?

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,118
Yeah. Budget couldn't stretch
to single lodgings so...

94
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,475
We'll make ourselves comfy, yeah?

95
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,754
Yeah?

96
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,596
I pushed and pushed but still nothing.

97
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,798
What the fuck are we gonna do here
without any drugs? Look it it.

98
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,872
Don't blame me if I've got guts of steel.

99
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,080
Dunno why you came anyway.
You don't even do history.

100
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,355
I thought it would be uplifting.

101
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,153
Let me have a go.

102
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,794
Cheers, man.

103
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,553
Magic fingers.

104
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,112
What the fuck?

105
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,430
What?

106
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,878
"Bad mood - comfy jim jams"?

107
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,350
What? You try arguing with
a 45-year-old Pakistani woman, then.

108
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,991
Did she pack you these as well?

109
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,958
No, but she packed me this.

110
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,756
Seriously impressive, man.

111
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,197
- Must have taken ages.
- You can have it, if you want.

112
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,438
Cheers.

113
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,229
Dinner.

114
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,159
Wank or tell group?

115
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,116
Wank or tell group?

116
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,873
Ah, tell group!

117
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,553
Guys, guys!

118
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,473
I've seen boobs! A girl with boobs!

119
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,028
God, that's pathetic, Anwar.

120
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,157
No. You wanna see this, though!
She's got a big chopper as well.

121
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,195
Oh, my God!

122
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,713
I wanna see that.

123
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,997
(Tom) Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, guys, what about your dinner?

124
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,719
You don't wanna look at
the girl with the boobs?

125
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,711
Nah. I prefer Welsh women.

126
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,110
She was there a second ago.
She <i>was</i> there.

127
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,078
She'll come back.
She was just there, I promise!

128
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,755
Tell us when the Spice Girls
turn up, too, yeah?

129
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,671
Piss off.

130
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,514
She was there. She had boobs.

131
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,192
Yeah, whatever, man.

132
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,952
What you doing?

133
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,350
Looking for your "Sexy Saturday Night
Leopard Skin Thong."

134
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,919
We're going out on the pull.

135
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,116
- Make sure you don't bring anyone back.
- Huh?

136
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,792
We are sharing a room Max, yeah.

137
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,996
I don't wanna have to pretend to be asleep

138
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,197
while you're doing whatever you do
with some big Cossack guy.

139
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,714
Maybe you can tempt your
big-boobed peasant girl in here.

140
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,313
Have a bit of party, you know?

141
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,713
Seriously, I don't wanna have to be
stuck around watching you do a guy.

142
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,391
Can I bring a girl back?

143
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,953
I could, couldn't I? You're shit, Anwar!

144
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,190
Have you ever tried being with a girl?

145
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,840
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Well, have you?

146
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,989
Well, have you ever
tried being with a man?

147
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,832
No! Don't be sick.

148
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,797
You calling me sick?

149
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,075
No!

150
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,515
I dunno what I think, yeah.

151
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,794
I'm just a Muslim.

152
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,394
Gay's... just wrong.

153
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,710
Then you don't want anything to do with me.

154
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,877
- All right, Max?
- No.

155
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,188
Why?

156
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,238
Well, Anwar's decided
to become a Muslim.

157
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,074
What, like, more Muslim
than he was already?

158
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,230
A bit more Muslim, yeah.

159
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,435
Oh.

160
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,159
So I need to sleep in here, OK?

161
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,357
Fine. Sid'll swap.
You don't mind, do you, mate?

162
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,795
No, it's cool.

163
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,996
Maybe take your bag, too?

164
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,395
Thanks.

165
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,199
What happened?

166
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,431
He's just, like, switched
about me being... You know.

167
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,635
Blond?

168
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,119
- No!
- Short?

169
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,633
Gay!

170
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,109
Shall I give you head?

171
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,236
- What?
- It'll cheer you up.

172
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,639
For fuck's sake.

173
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,950
You're supposed to be a friend,
and I've come here with a problem.

174
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,316
- You fuck!
- We're in Russia. I wanna try something new!

Maybe sometimes.
He always wants me the most.

You were right, Max.

Poor girl's totally out of it.
She's completely wasted.

Tony, you've got to stop fucking around.

Tony.

572
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,034
We've finally found something
you're not good at.

00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,158
Good night, Tony.

575
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,312
I'll find somewhere else to sleep.

576
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,471
What?

577
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,798
Oh, God.

Tom, just shut up.

- Yes, Nips?

585

Have you got something to tell me?

Er... I dunno.

587
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,830
I like your hair.

No. Your top's nice.

589

Great.
Just in time for Heathrow security.
