00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,240
Whoa... Chris.

2
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,399
It's not true, is it?

3
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,435
What?

4
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,229
They're all the same
size at action stations.

5
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,359
No...

6
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,873
Poor Chris.

7
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,037
Wow.

8
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,278
That's better...

9
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,396
Cool.

00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,112

Anwar?

19
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,875
Yup.

20
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,075
What date is it?

21
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,196
13th. What's up?

22
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,874
Allahu Akbar.

23
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,791
I think Michelle's
parents are back today.

24
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,757
Bummer.

25
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,035
Do you think I should remind her?

26
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,429
I'm trying to pray
to my god here, Cass.

27
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,512
Oh... wow...

28
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,433
Is he listening?

29
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,875
I hope not.

30
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,520
Otherwise he knows about all
those pills I necked last night.

31
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,670
Sing quietly.

32
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,716
Yup...

33
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,155
Allahu Akbar.

34
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,077
Cute.

35
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,993
Allahu Akbar.

36
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,515
Chelle...

37
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,077
Fuck off, Tone.

38
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,513
It's me, Cass.

39
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,114
Crazy bitch.

40
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,155
Yes.

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,037
Never fucking eats.

42
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,554
Right, but... Michelle...

43
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,473
Your mum gets back today... yeah?

44
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,391
Tomorrow.

45
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,597
Today's the 13th. Isn't it?

46
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,557
Mmm. Tomorrow.

47
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,152
Oh, hello, Cassandra...

48
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,357
Hi, Anna!
Hello, um...

49
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,030
It's Malcolm.

50
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,031
Malcolm, yeah, wow.

51
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,678
How was the honeymoon?

52
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,992
It was just wonderful, wasn't it babe?

53
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,868
Just us and 47 Namibian nomads
out there in the desert... Heaven.

54
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,029
Cool.

55
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,712
We do love a nomad, don't we, babe!

56
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,995
So have you been
helping Michelle clear up?

57
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,150
Oh, wow, totally.

58
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,754
I expect she told you about my
important meeting today?

59
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,752
Clients coming to look at
my curtain designs.

60
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,515
Right, can we get in?
I want some fucking Coco Pops.

61
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,511
Well, lovely to see you again Cassandra.

62
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,797
You're looking much better than
the last time I saw you. Well done.

63
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,395
Oh... You too.
Nice to meet you again, Martin.

64
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,118
It's Malcolm...

65
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,633
It's Malcolm.

66
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,472
For fuck's sake!

67
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,471
What's she on, hunger
strike or something?

68
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,993
Sshh!

69
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,197
Michelle, darling, here we are,
safe and sound.

70
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,870
Ahhhhh! What the fuck!

71
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,313
Mum! You didn't tell me!

72
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,109
Go go go... Come on, Jal...

73
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,349
Help...

74
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,714
Go!

75
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,711
I forgot my T-shirt.

76

77
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,436
Ah! Oh, oh...

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,310
I want to eat you, fuck bunny.

79
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,119
Oh... Oh... Oh!

80
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,111
Whoaa!

81
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,872
Cassie...

82
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,032
How you doing, kiddums?

83
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,599
You had some breakfast?

84
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,593
Oh, yeah. Michelle's does crazy
bacon, egg and sausage sandwiches.

85
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,999
They're mad.

86
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,798
There! Great!

87
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,873
I'm going... for a shower.

88
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,709
Little wittle!!

89
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,518
Do you want me to... feed Reuben?

90
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,910
Oh, would you, sweetie?
I've got so much I've got to do...

91
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,558
< Hey!

92

Thanks, poppet...

95
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,599
It's my final clinic day.

96
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,671
They'll sign me off if
I've gained a half kilo.

97
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,079
Oh, yeah? Have you done it?

98
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,878
Totally... For sure.

99
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,076
Hey... Hurray!

100
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,153

OK. Yes.
All changed and clean, yes.

Thanks. I feel great, Dad.

118

Course you do... What do you think?

119

Oh, wow!

Cool.

122
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,913
Did Reubens do his poo?

123
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,673
Oh, Yes.
He's like all changed and asleep.

124
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,469
Ah, thanks, that's super!

125
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,630
The taxi's here.

126
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,835
Taxi?

127
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,797
They send it from the clinic
to make sure I go.

128
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,711
Yes, of course.

129
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,597
They're signing her off, darling!

130
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,796
Fantastic!

131
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,519
We knew you'd make it through.

132
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,275
Wonderful!
And don't forget to say thank you.

133
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,715
Oh... I will... totally.

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,389
Ah yes... Yes.

137
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,072
OK, my beautiful.

the money...

140
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,755
You got enough room
back there, Cassie?

141
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,592
You wouldn't tell on me,
would you, Alan?

142
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,989
You know me, kid. See no.

143
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,913
Hear no. Speak no.

144
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,272
They'll sign me out
if I'm half a kilo up.

145
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,271
Do you know what you're doing?

146
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,635
Oh, totally... I'm so fine...

147
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,317
I'll miss you, Tiny...

148
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,958
Oh, wow...

149
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,473
Yeah...

150
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,993
You too, Alan.

151
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,190
You gonna eat this time, Cassie?

152
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,271
Totally.

153
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,675
Hey.

154
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,275
Don't give me the smile.
Not that smile, OK?

155
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,828
OK, Alan.

156
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,036
Love you.

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,678

159
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,631
Sure.

160
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,395

Sorted.

185
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,319
I need to be quick.

186
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,919
Christ, I wanna wizz.

187
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,072
Busy... Wait, please.

188
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,913
Oh, fuck!

189
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,199
Get out off the fucking toilet!

190
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,794
Weight is correct.

191
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,440
"Demeanour...
Satisfactory.

192
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,071
"Attendance, Interaction,
Compliance... Yes, yes, yes.

193
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,071
"Mood... yes..."
How's your mood?

194
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,276
Oh... Fantastic. Really.

195
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,191
Excellent!

196
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,998
PHONE RINGS

197
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,990
Yes?

198
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,152
No... No...

199
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,231
I don't care who's going, Abigail.

200
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,914
You failed to comply with my wishes
regarding parties

201
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,753
and carpets were damaged.
Stop crying!

202
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,991
I am not an "expletive" bitch.

203
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,631
I am your mother!
Have you taken your medication?

204
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,472
Well, take it now...
Now!

205
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,034
So...

206
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,634
before you leave us
to start your new life,

207
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,316
it's important that you understand, um...

208
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,358
- Cassie.
- Cassie!

209
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,149
That if you are troubled again,
then you treat us

210
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,028
as a place of safety and refuge.

211
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,236
We like to think of Restoration

212
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,633
as a big family you can re-visit
any time it's necessary.

213
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,235
Here's my card with
the emergency number...

214
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,915
Calls <i>after</i> six are double.

215
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,230
We're all on your side.

216
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,869
Providing you have arrangements
in place for the fees.

217
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,154
How does that sound?

218
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,879
Lovely. I'm so grateful, really.

219
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,109
Good.

220
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,077
Thank you, Carrie.

221
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,310
You may go to Group Congratulations.

222
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,431
Dr Stock.

223
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,953
Thank you so much.

224
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,238
APPLAUSE

225
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,911
Well done, Cassie.

226
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,037
We'll miss you. Won't we?

227
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,917
Wow. Thanks everyone.

228
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,356
Right... Who's next?

229
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,873
Madison.

230
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,590
Can we congratulate you?

231
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,438
No, I'm not happy.

232
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,074
You!

233
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,388
You're staring at me.

234
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,914
No-one's staring at you, Madison.
Are we?

235
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,549
(Group) No... No...

236
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,870
Now. What's been troubling you?

237
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,595
I keep telling myself that maybe
I'm a bit over-sensitive, you know,

238
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,229
and it's... It's starting to work.

239
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,833
There's no more...

240
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,388
no more voices going,
"Ba ba ba ba ba,"

241
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,190
no more voices whispering,
you know, "Ba-ba..."

242
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,589
And then... And then...

243
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,513
Spit it out Madison.
We're here for you, aren't we?

244
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,397
(Group) We are...

245
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,310
Perfectly straightforward
business deal, right?

246
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,710
This kid asks me for credit terms
and I'm like...

247
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,075
"trust"...

248
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,832
Yeah?

249
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,629
Well done, Madison.

250
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,110
The only thing that I ask...

251
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,350
is repayment...

252
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,910
in a clearly defined schedule.

253
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,355
So I give him what he wants.

254
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,793
What did he want?

255
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,757
Goods and services...

256
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,269
This fat fuck.

257
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,992
This deceiving, scheming
little pluke!

258
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,230
He thinks...

259
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,757
that he can get away
with cheating me out of my money...

260
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,753
Maybe he wasn't trying
to cheat you, Madison.

261
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,034
Oh, yeah?

262
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,190
It's a misunderstanding.

263
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,632
Really?

264
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
We need you to work on this,
Madison.

265
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,478
Well, I'm working on it!

266
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,913
I'm working on it.

267
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,399
Er, chips, please.

268
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,719
Few more.

269
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,673
Just a few more.

270
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,269
Cheers!

271
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,874
Hi, Marnie.
What are we?

272
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,712
Pilchard.

273
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,631
Cute. What we saying?

274
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,029
We're saying we're an oily fish,

275
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,954
tasty and rich in healthy
life-giving Omega fats.

276
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,473
Sodding Jamie Oliver.

277
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,515
Bummer.

278
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,477
Go on, then.

279
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,515
You sure?

280
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,388
Yes, why not, I'm into long life.
Cheers, Marnie.

281
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,469
See you later.

282
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,272
Smart-arsed blonde fucker.

283
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,395
All right.

284
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,359
- All right, Sidie boy.
- Kiss me, you fool!

285
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,398
Yeah, white boy!! Wha gwan. Rrraas!

286
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,630

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,234
White boy got bear shit

288
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,476
What's the frequency, Kenneth?

289
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,913
Sorry.

290
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,230
Got a bit carried away there.

291
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,753
I think you did, man.

292
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,875
Oh, do stop it, OK?

293
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,635
It's not funny.

294
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,231
Can I sit here?

295
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,153
Yeah, sure, go for it.

296
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,549
Oh, cool. So nice of you.

297
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,989
You been home, Sid?

298
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,911
No, came straight from Michelle's.

299
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,195
You <i>left</i> before her mum
called the police?

300
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,349
Yeah.

301
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,396
Went a bit wrong.

302
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,598
Then Tony had to go and Jujitsu
Mr Michelle's cos...

303
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,319
Well, because he's a total
fucking wanker really.

304
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,992
You love Tony.

305
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,314
Pardon?

306
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,073
I said, you love Tony.
You always talk about him.

307
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,275
Do I?

308
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,478
I mean, it's cool you've
got someone to look up to.

309
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,994
Oh, it was fun.

310
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,230
Throwing all that food around.

311
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,949
Just like, throwing it everywhere.

312
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,555
Wow. Wow!

313
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,678
Whoa.

314
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,239
You must be hungry.

315
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,232
Yeah. Bit of a hangover and... Yeah.

316
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,632
There.

317
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,153
Go on then.

318
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,115
You gonna eat that?

319
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,952
Oh, totally.

320
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,838
I'm better now. I'm totally better.

321
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,239
How do you do it?

322
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,356
What?

323
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,954
Come on, Cass.
I mean you never eat anything.

324
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,315
Your parents must notice
or something.

325
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,516
I dunno.

326
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,874
I like you, Sid.

327
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,953
OK.

328
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,598
So I'm going to show you.

329
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,113
You have to do a lot of talking.
I'm good at talking.

330
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,115
You do that while you're cutting
things up a lot. Then, questions.

331
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,394
Where's your Student Card?

332
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,230
Sorry?

333
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,550
Your ID, have you got it?

334
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,551
No I, er, lost it
somewhere last week.

335
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,596
Change the subject.
This is great.

336
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,513
I love these sausages.
You should try one. Go on.

337
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,353
Delicious. Mmmm.

338
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,317
Hang on you didn't...

339
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,358
You're not quite sure what I'm on
about but I keep distracting you.

340
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,759
Then I up the ante.

341
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,637
Yum. I love this stuff.

342
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,676
Really delicious.

343
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,638
You're reassured I want some more
and I'll keep waving it at you

344
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,109
until you stop looking at me.

345
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,191
Where did you lose it?

346
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,951
Sorry?

347
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,271
Your ID. I mean, they won't let
you use the library, will they?

348
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,794
God, I've gotta go.

349
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,596
Oh.

350
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,194
I'm so full.

351
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,918
Gotta dash.

352
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,671
There you go. Job done.

353
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,512
That's impressive.

354
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,555
Cheers.

355
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,712
But aren't you kind of, you know,
lying to everyone?

356
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,598
I'm so better.
I got discharged from the clinic.

357
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,716
Seems a bit fucked up.

358
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,358
What?

359
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,557
I said just seems a bit
fucked up, that's all.

360
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,593
Oh, wow.

361
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,834
But you see...

362
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,276
It's like nobody's fucking business.

363
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,909
And it's not exactly
like anybody cares, so...

364
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,309
I care.

365
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,829
Look. Pilchards. Cool.

366
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,434
And I got it from a fish lady.

367
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,750
Yeah, I wasn't so keen on them.

368
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,310
What you fucking talking about?
Omega fats and fishy oils,

369
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,913
they're cool.

370
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,117
I was just chatting to Cass, Tony.

371
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,350
Hey, Cass.

372
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,271
How's dippy world?

373
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,548
She's better. She just got
discharged from the clinic.

374
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,438
Yeah, whatever. Jesus!

375
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,589
What?

376
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,715
Don't you ever wash?

377
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,553
That's like lipstick.

378
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,676
Yeah, man, the essence of woman.

379
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,273
Well, one at least.

380
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,679
So who's the lucky lady?

381
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,432
That's like someone kissed me.

382
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,956
I can't believe you haven't
washed man. You stink!

383
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,075
Somebody kissed me.

384
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,195
Well, yeah, mate,

385
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,794
that's a total fucking operator
error cos you stink.

386
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,598
I didn't have time.

387
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,832
Time? I've been home, showered,
done my Chi, had a wank,

388
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,392
subtly undermined my dad,
put new clothes on and here I am

389
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,550
with my English coursework.

390
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,474
English coursework. Oh, fuck!

391
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,711
Sometimes I wonder why you even
bother to get up in the morning.

392
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,590
You're such a complete fucking
waste of time and... Ahh, shit!

393
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,958
Wow, Tony. Bummer. It looks
like you pissed yourself.

394
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,315
That's not supposed
to fucking happen.

395
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,073
Look at Tony, man. Ah, shit man!

396
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,789
Raas blood white boy gone
piss himself up you get me!

397
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,711
Mandem's sick stains. Hey, Cuz!

398
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,153
Yo got serious stains!

399
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,037
Him cream up his pussy good style.

400
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,391
I'm a bad person.

401
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,868
Come on!

402
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,279
< That hurt, actually!

403
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,759
Gotta go. Sure you have.

404
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,673
Finish off the rest of my
food if you want.

405
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,795
OK.

406
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,272
This guy from my group
therapy's got your ID card.

407
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,830
And he's a crazy fuck and he
hates you because you cheated him.

408
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,433
What's his name?

409
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,112
He likes to be called Mad.

410
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,155
Twatter.

411
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,151
Yeah. Totally. What did you do?

412
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,557
I bought some dope on the tick,

413
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,359
and then we lost it
in the harbour and...

414
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,238
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

415
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,638
Tony!

416
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,035
This is a room for female staff.

417
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,238
Yeah. The drier's broken in ours.

418
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,880
Ah, there you are.
Jesus, we're in trouble!

419
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,077
That crazy fucking dealer
found us, Tony. Hi, Angie.

420
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,233
We gotta do something. I mean, you
could talk to him and... Oh, fuck.

421
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,595
Oh, you wankers.
That was well funny, man.

422
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,879
But someone's gonna have to apologise
cos Kenneth's crying now so...

423
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,555
Oh, Jesus Christ,
Holy Mary, Mother of God!

424
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,073
That's Angie! Don't look! Get out!

425
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,832
For fuck's sake! Fuck off!

426
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,115
< Sorry, Angie.

427
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,393
You still got it.

428
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,994
Get out of there
and don't look at her, all right?

429
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,677
You like me. You like me.

430
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,557
Look up if you like me.

431
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,393
Look up if you like me.

432
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,273
Look up if you like me.

433
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,670
Oh, bugger.

434
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,195
Shit!

435
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,478
Oh! Sid.

436
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,120
Hi. Sorry, Angie.

437
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,714
You shouldn't go into
the staff showers, Sid.

438
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,792
I know, I know.
It was a crisis.

439
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,839
Well, it's just a bit
embarrassing that's all.

440
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,593
Actually, I'm pretty
confident about my body...

441
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,990
No, I'm having a crisis.

442
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,513
Oh.

443
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,039
Well, sometimes adult bodies can be
a little overwhelming.

444
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,237
Oh, for Christ's sake, Angie,
I don't care about your tits!

445
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,999
Oh.

446
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,119
I'm in deep, deep, deep shit.

447
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,036
Right.

448
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,156
OK.

449
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,958
You need advice?

450
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,555
I need advice and 300 quid.

451
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,030
Otherwise someone's going to
be re-possessing my bollocks.

452
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,915
OK, well look, when it comes to debt,

453
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,231
the best thing to do is to face up
to it before it gets out of hand.

454
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,309
Yeah?

455
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,756
Yeah. All you have to do is go
to the person you owe money to

456
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,116
and calmly ask them to
reschedule the payments.

457
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,998
Reschedule payments?
So that's one ball now

458
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,116
and then the balance next week.

459
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,034
Believe me, Sid,
I'm a responsible adult.

460
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,350
I know. OK?

461
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,874
Now what was it,
a phone or something?

462
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,988
Actually, Angie, it was three
ounces of prime hydroponic skunk.

463
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,672
Shit!

464
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,671
Yeah, shit.

465
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,872
Go to the police.

466
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,190
They'll arrest me.

467
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,349
Give it back.

468
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,953
I lost it in the harbour.

469
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,712
Keep your head down.

470
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,633
He's got my student ID card.

471
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,314
Right.

472
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,198
Right. OK.

473
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,953
Basically, I'm fucked, aren't I?

474
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,792
Yep.

475
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,679
Well, thanks, Angie,

476
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,115
I feel a lot better now, yeah.

477
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,749
Look, give me a moment. I'm sure
I can come up with something...

478
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,876
No, sorry.

479
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,433
Chris.

480
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,999
Mm-hm.

481
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,878
You've come to apologise, right?

482
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,154
Huh?

483
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,355
To say sorry.

484
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,955
Oh, yes. Erm, yes, I'm sorry.

485
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,474
Sorry I saw your boobs.

486
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,437
Sorry I saw your bum.

487
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,511
Erm, sorry I saw your...

488
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,794
Apology accepted, Chris.

489
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,632
Right.

490
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,712
Well, I've got work to do.
So if you're done...

491
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,233
Yeah.

492
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,631
Chris.

493
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,872
You shouldn't look at me like that.

494
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,749
Sorry.

495
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,478
It isn't appropriate.

496
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,551
I'm your teacher and...

497
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,676
Have you always had that mole?

498
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,354
Um... Yes.

499
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,757
It's lovely.

500
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,232
Oh, God.

501
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,598
PHONE BUZZES

502
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,798

OK, right, everybody, listen up.

504
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,596
I'm gonna be taking in
your assignments today.

505
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,829
Why are you so relaxed about this?

506
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,434
So he's got your ID Card.
So what?

507
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,078
Um... everybody?

508
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,958
So what? He's gonna cut
my fucking bollocks off!

509
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,075
Chill out, Sid. I'm chilled, right?

510
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,559
Why are you so chilled?

511
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,632
I'm confident and relaxed
with my ability to improvise.

512
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,996
I'm going on a course
for the rest of the week,

513
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,752
and I'm not going to be here.

514
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,718
Also, I didn't buy the drugs.
You did.

515
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,711
Nice one, thanks, Tone...

516
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,920
Guys, look... We've got a supply
teacher coming in for next week

517
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,959
and in fact, he's on his way up
from the office now to say hello.

518
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,598
Everybody...

519
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,275
Look. There's 3,000 students at
this college. He won't find you.

520
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,831
So if you give me your assignments,
I promise that I'll have them

521
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,797

522

Hi, can I help?

523
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,873
Supply teacher!

524
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,350
Oh, Hi. Hi. Hi. We really
appreciate the short notice.

525
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,910

Nice to meet you, Tom.

530
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,909
- You got a problem?
- No, no...

531
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,235
Because, er it's been a while
since I... taught...

532
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,839
I just... I just wanna say that it's
a beautiful, beautiful thing to do.

Right. Um...
Right, so you'll start next week?

534
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,512
No. No, I've already started.

535
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,559
I don't know,
checking lists and things.

536
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,870
Checking lists?

537
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,350
Yeah. Who's who and
what's what and blah blah.

538
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,274
I'm really looking forward to,
er, to meeting you.

539
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,714
Oh, I'm beside
myself with excitement.

Sid. Look at me, man.

543
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,592
Oh, God.

544
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,237
What's happening for Christ sakes?

545
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,390
His fucking dealer's
a supply teacher.

546
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,037
Oh, God.

547
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,235
So?

548
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,311
So he's gonna cut
Sid's bollocks off.

549
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,913
(Anwar) Sid.

550
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,752
Oh, God. Oh, God.

551
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,150
Sid. Sid. I'm going to tap you, OK?

552
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,954
Oh, God.

553
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,554
Maybe a bit harder.

554
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,915
For Christ sakes!

555
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,839
Right. It's a problem but Sid's our friend and
we're going to solve it, OK?

556
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,434
Got that, Sid? We're gonna
put our heads together

557
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,397
and come up with a solution.

558
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,235
Sid. We're here for you. We're
thinking of the answer right now.

559
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,071
Anyway, I've got sociology so em...

560
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,513
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

561
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,635
Don't we have to go
over your French, yes?

562
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,119
Yeah, we should go.

563
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,714
Hang on.

564
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,470
We're going to give this some
serious thought, yeah, guys and... OK?

565
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,518
We can't just leave him like this.

566
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,190
We'll get back to him.

567
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,350
Yes, that's it. OK?
See you later, man.

568
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,110
We're gonna
get back to you on this, Sid. OK?

569
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,074
Mum?

570
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,913
This is Sid - your son.

571
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,117
Listen, I've got a problem.
Could you ring me back please?

572
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,992
BEEPING

573
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,392
Sid. Are you OK?

574
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,630
Bit fucked up as it goes.

575
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,598
Yeah, I'm sorry.

576
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,313
Yeah.

577
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,393
It's like totally kind what you're doing, but it
won't make any difference.

578
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,959
Huh?

579
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,519
The texts you're sending.

580
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,319
The messages...

581
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,958
What are you on about, Cass?

582
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,430
I've got a few problems
here of my own, you know?

583
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,956
I know, but...
Thanks anyway, for trying.

584
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,519
Cassie, I haven't been
sending you any messages.

585
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,079
I just saw you.

586
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,797
There aren't any messages on here.

587
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,950
What?

588
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,190
There aren't any
messages on your phone, Cass.

589
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,677
I thought...
I thought you liked me.

590
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,796
What?

591
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,836
Nothing.

592
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,797
BABY CRIES

593
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,031
Hello.

594
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,678
Yes, it's Cassie.

595
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,471
I think I need to see you again.

596
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,032
Hi.

597
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,076
Hello, kid. What's up?

598
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,674
I'm having a few probs.

599
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,432
Oh, Cassie. I'm listening.

600
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,910
There's somebody I like.

601
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,671
I thought he was
sending me a message -

602
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,671
texts and things, but he wasn't.

603
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,999
What was the message?

604
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,354
"Eat."

605
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,032
Right.

606
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,958
It wasn't you, was it, Alan?

607
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,998
I don't tell you what to do,
Cassie. I'm just a taxi driver.

608
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,231
So, like,

609
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,117
who's telling me to eat?

610
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,838
Who wants you to eat?

611
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,076
You got permission.

612
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,599
I haven't got a knife and fork.

613
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,874
You don't need them.

614
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,188
No.

615
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,108
What kind of day did you have?

616
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,952
Fine.

617
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,558
Have you got any more good tunes?

618
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,874
I love you, Cass.

619
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,473
I love you, too, Alan.

620
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,595
So eat.
