1
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,997
Sid!

2
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,595
Yeah, sorry. It's just there was a...

3
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,918
Now, this is exactly what
I'm talking about, Sid.

4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,676
Ok? Lack of concentration,
inability to focus, nada commitment.

5
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,514
Now, this piece of coursework
I have marked "ungraded".

6
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,113
Ungraded? What?

7
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,509
I can't pass him with this mark.

8
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,875
Fucking hell!

9
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,077
- Mark...
- Mark, please. With this mark...

10
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,515
Not you, Mark, this mark.

11
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,717
You have failed the entire year.

12
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,199
He's what?

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,679
He's failed the entire year.

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,115
Sod, you... sidding... idiot!

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,990
Ah, hold on, there's no need to panic.
Because I fought for you, Sid, I really did,

16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,119
and got you an extension.

17
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,069
It was hard, but I worked
at it, and I got it.

18
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,230
- Right?
- Got what right?

19
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,869
No, I got it. Right?

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,713
Thanks... Tom.

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,236
So... 2,000 words on Lech Walesa,
Solidarity and the collapse of Soviet power.

22
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,595
Jesus Christ!

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,240
You've got two days. Get your head down.

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,392
You better fucking believe
he's getting his head down.

25
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,031
You can say goodbye to sunshine,
Sunshine. You are grounded.

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,830
Put it this way. Let's
change and develop. Ok?

27
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,759
Thanks, Tom. We're all very grateful
for this second chance. Aren't we, Mark?

28
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,512
Yes. Thank you very much.

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,070
Oh, yes, my boy! We're
going to do this my way now!

30
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,833
You hear me? The gravy
train has terminated!

31
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,512
Terminated! You lazy little fucker.

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,556
- Mark!
- Did Tony fail this?

33
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,595
No.

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,114
No, of course not! And
why? Why didn't he fail it?

35
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,428
He doesn't do history.

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,431
Right!

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,318
You are going to get
something... something right,

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,278
if it's the last thing I ever
do. What's your next class?

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,477
- Drama...
- Right. Drama. Home. Coursework.

40
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,233
Fucking perfection! Or else.

41
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,072
Why are you talking in
very short sentences?

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,357
Emphasis! Drama! Fuck off!

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,435
Honestly, Sid, you
know this upsets people.

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,750
Sorry.

45
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,195
Just... give it a try, ok?

46
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,113
Ok.

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,158
Ok, everyone. Everyone reach.

48
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,919
Oh, Christ...

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,037
Reach up. Stretch out your leaves.

50
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,351
That looks so crap, doesn't it?

51
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,032
Go on.

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,473
Fuck that.

53
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,599
Why don't you go to the
green and get stoned instead?

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,432
No. No, you mustn't.

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,988
That would be bad. Bad, do you hear?

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,200
And you're a good boy really.
Good. Drama. Fuck it... be bad!

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,111
Be good. Drama!

58
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,315
- Fuck it!
- Drama...

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,197
Shut up... will you?

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,717
- Pretty nice gear, huh?
- Yeah, very funny.

61
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,917
- Where you going?
- I gotta go to this lesson.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,831
Fuck it, man.

63
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,798
- Fuck it?
- Fuck it.

64
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,108
Yeah, let's go.

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,668
Right, Donny, you fart
once more and you're out.

66
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,715
Sid?

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,791
Hi. Wow, Maxxie, you look all horny.

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,869
You can tell?

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,750
Sid... I just wanted to
remind you of our date tonight.

70
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,558
Oh... Shit.

71
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,997
Thing is, Cass, my
dad kinda grounded me.

72
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,274
I gotta do coursework.

73
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,079
Oh, wow.

74
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,718
I was really...

75
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,880
I didn't eat for three
days so I could be lovely.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,318
Er, sorry.

77
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,755
Maybe I'll come over and say hello.

78
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,831
I dunno. Maybe.

79
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,955
Safe.

80
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,473
Wow.

81
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,952
Go on, give her one.

82
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,917
That would be so bad!

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,231
I bet she bangs like a ferret on acid!

84
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,678
- Hey.
- Hey.

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,957
I didn't know which one to
get. They were both so pretty.

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,632
Anyway, I got them both.

87
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,269
What do you think? Which skirt?
This goes with my slutty green top.

88
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,555
This one is more virgin.

89
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,437
Yeah?

90
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,919
Tony? Which skirt?

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,115
Hmm?

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,952
Oh, yeah, it's nice.

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,669
Are you listening? I'm asking what
to wear to Tribe Of Frog tomorrow?

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,160
Did you ask Chris about pills?

95
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,151
We can have Mitsubishis.

96
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,912
Is that OK, Tone?

97
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,231
Tone?

98
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,440
Wear that one to Tribe Of Frog,
and that one to my choir concert.

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,193
- Choir concert? When?
- Tonight.

100
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,555
You and Sid are coming to hear me sing.

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,200
Are we? How come?

102
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,794
It just occurred to me
how much fun it could be.

103
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,198
Russia... was... a... superpower...

104
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,476
and...

105
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,757
Er... Lech Walesa...

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,831
was a...

107
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,198
Polish... Er...

108
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,399
man... who...

109
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,591
What the fuck did he do? Erm...

110
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,233
Bollocks.

111
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,269
Fuck it.

112
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,511
Right, you have been warned!

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,273
Oh, yes, I warned you!
This is what happens.

114
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,873
No telly.

115
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,838
No stereo.

116
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,549
No... Asian Fanny Fun.

117
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,915
That should be enough to
help you concentrate. Is it?!

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,798
- Yes, Dad.
- Yes. Thank you.

119
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,871
You'll thank me for this one day.

120
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,998
Oh! Oh, fuck!

121
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,913
What's happened?

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,037
I've fallen down the fucking
stairs, you silly cow!

123
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,633
Bugger.

124
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,036
Ah, for fuck's sake.

125
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,757
Ah, yeah. That's better.

126
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,228
Oh, yeah. Ah, yeah.

127
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,877
I'm just gonna go out and
come back in again. Ok?

128
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,678
Would you?

129
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,230
- Hello.
- It's Tony!

130
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,550
Yeah, er, come in!

131
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,712
All right, Sid? Thought
you might need a hand.

132
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,473
With your coursework. Shall
we let some air in here?

133
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,471
Yeah.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,514
That's better. Is that a
picture of my girlfriend?

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,309
Wondered where that went.

136
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,470
Right then.

137
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,472
Russia... Lech Walesa...

138
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,754
Jesus, Sid.

139
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,558
The USSR model could be
described as a relationship

140
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,111
of control and manipulation,
but events in the G...

141
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,155
Gdansk.

142
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,074
shipyard in the autumn of
1980 was the beginning of a...

143
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,355
That's some really good bullshit.

144
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,000
Not a problem. Ok, let's go.

145
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,274
Where to?

146
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,873
My choir concert.

147
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,598
Don't tell me you forgot.

148
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,079
I can't. I'm grounded.

149
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,197
Don't be such a fucking vagina.
This is gonna be special.

150
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,316
Anyway, I need someone
to keep Michelle company.

151
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,470
Michelle's coming?

152
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,471
Oh, yes. Nips'll be there.

153
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,028
And you'll wanna see this. Trust me.

154
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,793
Sorry about that. You
won't tell her, will you?

155
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,395
She thinks the world
of you, Sid. Really.

156
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,109
And things run their
course. You get bored.

157
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,430
Are you gonna tell me
what you're talking about?

158
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,593
You'd better be doing some fucking
work. Hi, Tony. How's things?

159
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,912
Not bad, Mark. Is that landfill survey
finished? I'd really love to see it sometime.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,036
Yeah, no problem. Yeah.

161
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,192
Actually, it's quite an interesting
analysis of decomposition rates.

162
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,395
But look, actually, er, Sid's
got some work to do now, so...

163
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,233
Ok. Hope to see you very soon, Sid.

164
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,276
Nice to see you, Mark.

165
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,153
- Bye, Liz!
- Bye, Tony!

166
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,832
What?

167
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,717
Why could you not be like...

168
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,271
Why did I?

169
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,635
Ow!

170
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,475
* I got a date with the night

171
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,074
* Pullin' out my finger

172
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,354
* Gonna catch the kids dry

173
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,635
* Gonna walk on water

174
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,352
* Buying out the fight

175
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,796
* We're sweatin' in the winter

176
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,989
* Both thighs squeeze tight

177
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,833
* Both thighs squeeze tight

178
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,559
Ohl

179
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,635
'Mega Dog to the rescue!
Attack, attack! Woof-woof! '

180
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,073
I'm not being aggressive...

181
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,354
Yes, you are.

182
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,078
You're the aggressive one.

183
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,755
Look at you, the Virgin Mary with
your fucking little looks and sneers.

184
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,308
But that's you. Never saying anything.

185
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,358
Leaving it to me to deal with
Captain fucking Calamity up there.

186
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,158
Never backing me up.

187
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,355
That's not true.

188
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,715
The boy's useless,
completely fucking useless.

189
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,028
I sometimes wonder if he's even mine.

190
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,473
Oh, he's yours all right, Mark.

191
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,757
'Mega Dog's trying to tell us something!

192
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,558
'Woof, woof, woof! Woof, woof! '

193
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,835
Hi, Sid. We're just talking.

194
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,070
Right. Talking, yeah.

195
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,357
Get on with your coursework. We
need to do some more... talking.

196
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,431
You see what you've done now?

197
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,717
- What I've done?
- Yes, what you've done.

198
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,155
You stupid, stupid man.

199
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,629
What do you mean, stupid?
Don't call me stupid.

200
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,030
I am not a stupid man. If you would
listen for a second to what's...

201
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,359
What are you doing here, anyway?

202
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,273
Well, I heard "choirgirls" so I came.

203
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,794
Shall we?

204
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,829
I said if they can't fucking educate
her, then I'll take my business elsewhere.

205
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,232
Four fucking grand a term
and the girl gets three GCSEs?

206
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,276
That's the return on my investment?

207
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,316
Where's my margin? What
do they think we are?

208
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,789
Fucking stupid or something...

209
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,477
God Only Knows

210
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,555
Na-na-na-na
na-na...

211
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,198
Where's Tony?

212
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,396
I don't know. Fuck! We'd
better be at the right concert.

213
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,278
No, it's definitely here.

214
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,717
You never need to doubt it

215
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,112
I'll make you so sure about it

216
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,954
God only knows what
I'd be without you...

217
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,511
Beach Boys, man. Fucking top!

218
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,477
I don't understand this. Where is he?

219
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,515
Hold on.

220
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,477
Ah, ah, ah, ah

221
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,394


224
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,038
No, no, no, look, there he is.

225
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,156
'Mega Dog to the rescuel

226
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,198

* I may not always love you

228
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,197

are stars above you

Play, David, play

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,876
David, play on your
harp Hallelu, Hallelujah

249
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,518
David, play on your harp

250
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,989
Hallelu...

251
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,476
Hi. I just wanted to...

252
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,030
God! I'm sorry, ok! I'm sorry.

253
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,196
And I need you now tonight

254
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,111
And I need you more than ever...

255
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,838
What the fuck?

256
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,512
Um. Excuse me?

257
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,989
Hi. Just checking Abi's
diaphragm contractions.

258
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,957
What the hell is going on?

259
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,634
The simple act of performance,
sweetie. What did you think?

260
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,349
Bullshit, Tony. You fucking sick...

261
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,000
God, you're such a wanker.

262
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,308
Here...

263
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,118
Fuck you.

264
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,350
Fluffy teddy-bear?

265
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,911
That's my lucky teddy!

266
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,319
And you can fuck off, too!

267
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,836
Well... Michelle. I'm just wondering
why you're overreacting like this.

268
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,876
Overreacting?!

269
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,757
Right in my face, you whore!

270
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,195
You know, typically,
episodes of paranoia

271
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,999
might be symptomatic of a wide
range of emotional and mental issues.

272
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,310
Maybe, you know, you need
some help with the outbursts.

273
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,356
My mother's a psychologist, she could...

274
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,954
Oh!

275
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,715
Ow! I'll kill you, you fucking
flat-chested cocksucking

276
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,268
spastic horse-fucker!

277
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,956
Woah, good swearing.

278
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,110
Bye, Tony.

279
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,077
Later, Nips.

280
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,039
Abi, wonder if you could
give me and Sid a minute.

281
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,509
Yes... I need my medication.

282
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,836
See, told you it'd be worth coming for.

283
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,717
Looks like me and
'Chelle are on a break.

284
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,109
You did that on purpose?

285
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,713
- Go after her.
- What?

286
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,791
Life throws up so few opportunities...

287
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,677
But she's your girlfriend.

288
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,832
- Who you love.
- What?

289
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,399
Change. It's a wonderful thing.

290
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,513
Look, you know how subatomic
particles don't obey physical laws?

291
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,309
They act according to
chance, chaos, coincidence...

292
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,188
They run into each other in the middle
of the universe, and, bang! Energy.

293
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,431
We're the same as that.

294
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,149
That's the great thing about
the universe. Unpredictable.

295
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,719
That's why it's so much fun.

296
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,472
I'm... just gonna go see
if she's ok, all right?

297
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,312
Sid. Bang!

298
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,269
Michelle would never...
never fuck a horse.

299
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,832
Ok, so this line here means you're
gonna live till you're at least 80,

300
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,638
and this line here,

301
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,555
that means you should be careful around
electricity pylons and crocodiles...

302
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,870
- Cwocodiles?!
- That's right.

303
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,556
All right, daarlin'! 'Ad a bad night?

304
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,669
Piss off.

305
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,751
What's your problem?
You giving us cheek?

306
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,876
- No.
- She so is.

307
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,635
Hey, Ems, this girl is being
rude to Char and Shall...

308
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,199
- She's giving us cheek.
- Yeah?

309
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,158
Fuck off out of my way.

310
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,878
You givin' them cheek?

311
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,679
- Cheek...
- She so is.

312
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,591
No.

313
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,636
- D'ya wanna fight?
- No.

314
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,789
Are you givin' me cheek?

315
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,075
What does that even mean?

316
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,391
Hi, Michelle, um, hello, ladies.
Shall we... just let it go, yeah?

317
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,118
Whatever.

318
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,679
Fat bitch.

319
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,159
You fucking what?

320
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,838
Get off her!

321
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,399
Leave her alone.

322
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,311
- Get off.
- Have some of that.

323
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,197
Get off her.

324
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,952
Just get off!

325
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,156
Come on, get off her!

326
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,989
- Are you ok?
- Yes. I'm fucking fantastic

327
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,115
Can I? Shall I?

328
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,476
- You knew... You fucking knew about her!
- No, I didn't!

329
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,790
How could you fucking
not know, you arsehole?

330
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,235
You and your fucking bum chum!

331
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,710
- No, I really didn't!
- Fuck off!

332
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,870
You gave me cheek.

333
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,592
Sorry...

334
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,150
Sorry don't work. You gave her cheek.

335
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,434
Did I?

336
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,954
I'm pretty sure I didn't.

337
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,679
My mate... she gave you cheek.

338
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,478
You give us cheek, too.

339
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,676
You so did.

340
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,831
Is there any possible way
I could avoid a kicking?

341
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,673
You could try talking
your way out of it.

342
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,069
Um, er... ok. Er...

343
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,478
'Mega Dog to the rescue! '

344
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,198
Em! Come on. Happy hour down 'Firkin!

345
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,198
Mate? Do you mind?

346
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,833
- Where the fuck have you been!!?
- Dad, I just nipped to the shops.

347
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,148
For three hours?

348
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,468
I got lost.

349
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,951
- My God, Sid, what happened? You're all...
- No, I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

350
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,712
What's that smell?

351
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,109
Er... Piss.

352
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,269
Yours?

353
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,715
Someone else's.

354
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,835
Right.

355
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,275
You were grounded. You
snooked... snook out.

356
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,315
Snuck out.

357
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,472
You snuck out. You even did
a half-arsed job of that.

358
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,472
It might be better to
do this in the morning.

359
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,357
Did you think we wouldn't know?

360
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,795
Did you actually think
that we wouldn't know?!

361
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,199
Dad, you're such a...

362
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,999
Such a what? Such a... Such a what?

363
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,718
Such a fucking what?
Such a fucking what?!

364
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,438
Dildo.

365
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,711
Oh, fuck the pair of you.

366
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,474
Bed.

367
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,997
Cassie...

368
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,469
What's that smell?

369
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,391
Just piss. What are
you doing here, Cass?

370
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,358
- You invited me round.
- Did I?

371
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,715
I've been waiting. Where were you?

372
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,395
- I was out.
- Who with?

373
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,909
Michelle.

374
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,839
Michelle?

375
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,752
Wow.

376
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,230
- Listen, Cass, I've had a bit of a bad night.
- Michelle's so lovely.

377
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,517
Michelle, my girl

378
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,795
I love her, I love her, I love herl

379
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,434
So hey, wow! Fuck you, Sid!

380
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,318
- Cassie, shh! My parents...
- Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

381
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,559
I'm going home.

382
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,394
- No, Cassie...
- Let go... Let go of me!

383
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,149
It's your choice, Sid.

384
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,152
Everything is your choice.

385
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,715
Wake up, Sid.

386
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,117
Bollocks.

387
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,435
Oh.

388
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,837
Hi, Mum.

389
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,478
How's the face?

390
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,393
- Sore.
- Ahh...

391
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,550
Get in. I'll take you.

392
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,073
Cheers.

393
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,115
'Ok!

394
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,715
'Now we're gonna ring up
Lee and we're gonna tell 'im

395
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,588
'that the Government is comin'
round to take 'is babbies away!

396
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,875
'Hello, Lee! '

397
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,879
Mum. Last night...

398
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,349
We were just worried, that's all.

399
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,433
Do you ever feel you know someone,

400
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,195
think you've seen everything they're
gonna do, and then they trump it?

401
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,793
Dad's having a hard time...

402
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,634
- I'm not talking about Dad.
- Oh?

403
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,190
- It's Tony.
- Oh. Tony's lovely.

404
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,035
Thanks, Mum.

405
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,236
Sid, hang on. Close the door.

406
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,553
You know we both really
love you. Don't you, Sid?

407
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,232
I suppose.

408
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,313
I want you to make more of an
effort with your dad in general.

409
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,233
- He's a good guy.
- He doesn't act like one.

410
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,311
Not recently, no.

411
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,188
- But things change, Sid.
- What do you mean?

412
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,679
You...

413
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,036
You need to work out a
way of getting on with him.

414
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,156
It's hard, I know.

415
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,434
Ok?

416
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,080
- I'll try.
- Good.

417
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,433
I'm...

418
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,793
Mum?

419
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,035
Yes.

420
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,511
Anyway, have these... For your eye.

421
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,909
Oh, have this, too.

422
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,515
- You eat too much crap.
- Yeah. I know.

423
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,636
Thanks, Mum.

424
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,709
See you later.

425
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,518
Yeah.

426
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,239
See you.

427
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,915
Sid?

428
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,831
Yeah?

429
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,679
Nothing.

430
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,518
Oh, man, what a goddamn mess

431
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,990
Nobody said this was fancy dress

432
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,638
You're lookin' good

433
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,233
Your hair

434
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,073
Where I'm from you'd be as good as dead

435
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,115
Come on

436
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,272
Get up, get up

437
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,035
Get on, get off all night...

438
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,348
Sid?

439
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,839
Sid!

440
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,118
Sunglasses off, please.

441
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,236
Ok, everybody, well done.

442
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,311
You've all passed!

443
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,119
Everyone except you, Sid.

444
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,474
Cor, mate! What happened.

445
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,834
Nothing. I'm fine, ok?

446
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,992
You've been fighting, Sid.

447
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,755
That's not "Changing
And Developing". Is it?

448
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,513
24 hours left, ok?

449
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,433
You've either got it or you don't...

450
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,114
You haven't got it. Ok?

451
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,111
All right, Tom. Sorry I'm late.

452
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,399
Yo! Last night, man. Cool. Total blast.

453
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,994
Everything you could
want from an evening.

454
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,108
Songs, choirgirls, colourful
costumes, fellatio... Rabbits...

455
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,159
- Rabbits?
- Look, don't ask, man. Yeah, so, Sid...

456
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,276
Woah! Was that Michelle?

457
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,430
No, er, there were these girls...

458
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,351
What kind of girls, Sid?

459
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,998
Big ones.

460
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,513
I thought you was
hanging out with Cassie.

461
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,160
Er... Bit of a mix up.

462
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,673
Yeah? Like what?

463
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,797
She was really looking forward to that.

464
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,359
Ok, everyone!

465
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,671
Because you've all given it
everything, you can go early.

466
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,193
But use the time wisely, ok?

467
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,999
Woah, woah, woah, sailor!

468
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,753
Not so fast. A little
you-me time, yeah?

469
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,038
Sooo...

470
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,633
Coursework?

471
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,598
- Ready for tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'm, like, halfway through.

472
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,558
Sid, there are people
here you can talk to.

473
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,200
I am here for you.

474
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,396
We can sort this out.

475
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,152
I'm all ears. Come on.

476
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,271
What? We can sort out the fact that

477
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,079
my best mate wants me to make a
move on his girlfriend, who I love,

478
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,072
even though she still loves
him and now actually hates me?

479
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,948
My Dad thinks I'm a complete fuck-up,
and can't stop acting like a fuck-up

480
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,953
and no matter what I try, I
can't stop pissing everyone off?

481
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,270
We can sort that out, can we?

482
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,156
Ok. Ok, yeah.

483
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,993
Give me a moment to, um...

484
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,150
Life, Sid.

485
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,313
There are lots of ups and downs, ok?

486
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,719
It is like a...

487
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,351
It's like a... bird, flying.

488
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,749
Find your wings, Sid.

489
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,035
Right.

490
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,680
And do your fucking coursework.
Otherwise you're fucked.

491
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,557
Yeah. Thanks, Tom. That sorts it.

492
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,279
Pas de probleme, Sidney.
So see you tomorrow.

493
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,397
Don't leave me hanging, G.

494
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,159
Safe!

495
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,440
- Hey. All go according to plan?
- No.

496
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,193
- Ho! That girl can really swing.
- No.

497
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,953
Your mistake, my friend, was
making your move too quickly.

498
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,995
What?

499
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,277
Yes, grasshopper. Sensei say
that boy must wait 12 hours

500
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,475
before he approach girl on rebound.

501
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,630
This is fucked up, Tone!

502
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,870
Isn't it?

503
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,679
- Don't you want her?
- I told you. It's a gift.

504
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,990
You fucking freak me out sometimes.

505
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,433
But it's never dull. Is it?

506
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,995
No.

507
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,709
Ring her. Take her for a
drink, and see what happens.

508
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,032
What's the worst that can happen?
It's your choice, dude. Your choice.

509
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,994
Ah, fuck.

510
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,555
'Hello? '

511
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,596
Hi, Michelle. It's Sid.

512
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,955
- 'Fuck off. I don't want to speak to you.'
- 'Chelle...

513
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,519
'You heard me! '

514
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,192
- I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.
- 'Wankers! '

515
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,748
Yeah, I know, and I
wanna see you so I can...

516
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,159
'What? '

517
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,992
Please. I wanna make it up to you.

518
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,035
- 'Fuck off.'
- Can I talk to you?

519
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,678
'Talk about what? I don't want to.'

520
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,432
Yes, I know, and I want...

521
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,671
'I can't take your shit, you
and Tony. You wanna talk? '

522
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,352
Yeah, yeah. Please, Michelle.

523
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,352
'I don't want to talk. I'm
tired. You both fucked me over.'

524
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,351
Meet me at Ronny's Bar, I'll explain.

525
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,634
'Explain, yeah... '

526
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,439
Please, 'Chelle, I wanna see you.

527
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,033
Hi.

528
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,633
Hi.

529
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,837
- Thanks for coming.
- That's ok.

530
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,151
Why weren't you at, um, college today?

531
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,591
Snap!

532
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,358
- Some right hook, that girl.
- Yeah.

533
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:33,029
Believe me, 'Chelle. I didn't know
he was pulling a stunt. I promise.

534
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,111
I promise.

535
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,439
What was that for?

536
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,318
For forgetting that you and
Tony are different people.

537
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,273
Is that easy to do?

538
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,316
Well, you come as a package,

539
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,039
but you're...

540
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,348
sweeter.

541
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,317
Nice.

542
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,719
Ah, shit.

543
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,791
I'm one of the nice boys.

544
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,108
Fantastic

545
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,394
I like this one.

546
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,109
I love you.

547
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,553
Huh?

548
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,278
Nothing.

549
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,315
Let's dance.

550
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,389
What?

551
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,959
Dance with me. Come on.

552
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,834
Come on.

553
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,558
Michelle, I've been a
bit silly, haven't I?

554
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,995
'Hello! '

555
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,479
Cassie? Hello, I've got your...

556
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,710
- 'Hello? '
- Who is that?

557
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,916
- 'What's that noise? Hello? '
- Hello? Hello?!

558
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,353
Is Cassie there?

559
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,271
Sid?

560
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,078
Oh, God!

561
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,513
Oh, Christ, she's done something!

562
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,555
'What? '

563
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,437
Why?

564
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,433
You've really got no
idea? For fuck's sake, Sid!

565
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,512
'Jal, wait? Where are you going? '

566
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,431
Where do you think I'm going?

567
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,509
Shit!

568
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,550
- Is she all right?
- She will be.

569
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,756
What have they done to her?

570
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,956
- Pumped her stomach.
- What?!

571
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,759
Why have you chose to
start caring about her now?

572
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,389
It's a bit fucking late. You're
the last person she needs right now.

573
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,710
Why? Why is this my fault?

574
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,872
All you had to do was go on
that fucking date. That's it.

575
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,110
But...

576
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,111
You need to be
relatives. Are you family?

577
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,634
- No.
- Yes, I'm her sister.

578
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,029
- Right. Is he your brother?
- No. He's not.

579
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,115
Hi, Sid.

580
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,832
Dad, what's going on?

581
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,271
Dad?

582
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,272
Er, your mum's... gone.

583
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,636
Gone? What do you mean, "gone"?

584
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,995
She packed a bag and
went to Auntie Rosie's.

585
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,150
Something she "has to do".

586
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,798
She can't live here any more.

587
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,711
She can't talk to me any more...

588
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,438
Hang on. Have you split up?

589
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,192
Oh, God, no, no.

590
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,158
So she's just not living here
or talking to you any more?

591
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,959
Yeah.

592
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,157
Right.

593
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,555
She said to tell you "sorry".

594
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,474
Why is she sorry?
Isn't her fault, is it?

595
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,035
Relationships are complicated...
and sometimes, you know...

596
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,633
You shouldn't blame yourself.

597
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,188
I don't blame myself. I blame you.

598
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,272
I know, and, you know, you have...

599
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,113
Shut up! Why did you let her go?!

600
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,838
Sid... I can't...

601
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,673
Because you're fucking
useless, you sodding idiot!

602
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,878
You stupid bastard. You
fucking stupid bastard!

603
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,157
That's my fucking mum!
And she's fucking gone!

604
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,992
- Sid, I'm so sorry...
- It's a bit late for that.

605
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,511
You've got to ring her.

606
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,876
- It won't do any good.
- Ring her! Or... Or...

607
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,191
You're fucking grounded
until you get her back!

608
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,840
- Huh?
- You fucking heard me!

609
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,876
Say goodbye to sunshine, Sunshine!

610
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,077
- Sid...
- I've got things to do!

611
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,589
* Put it behind you

612
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,312
* The hurt is gone

613
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,189
* Forget everything...

614
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,874
Can I come in?

615
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,837
* That you've done

616
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,315
* Time's movin' on

617
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,951
* Time's movin' on...

618
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,036
It'll be ok.

619
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,470
'Hey, Sid. Where'd you get to?

620
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,709
'Sid, hello?

621
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,716
'I know you're fucking there, mate.

622
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,552
'Come on, it was just a laugh.

623
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,311
'Don't be a fucking pussy.

624
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,789
'Sid, come on. Sid! '
