ROCK MUSIC PLAYS

2
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,997
(Man shouts) Sid!

3
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,595
Yeah, sorry. It's just there was a...

4
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,918
Now, this is exactly
what I'm talking about, Sid.

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,676
OK? Lack of concentration,
inability to focus, nada commitment.

6
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,514
Now, this piece of coursework
I have marked "ungraded".

7
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,113
Ungraded? What?

8
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,509
I can't pass him with this mark.

9
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,875
Fucking hell!

10
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,077
- Mark...
- Mark, please. With this mark...

11
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,515
Not you, Mark, this mark.

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,717
...you have failed the entire year.

13
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,199
He's what?

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,679
He's failed the entire year.

15
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,115
Sod, you... sidding... idiot!

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,990
Ah, hold on, there's no need to panic.
Because I fought for you, Sid, I really did,

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,119
and got you an extension.

18
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,069
It was hard, but I worked at it, and I got it.

19
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,230
- Right?
- Got what right?

20
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,869
No, I got it. Right?

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,713
Thanks... Tom.

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,236
So... 2,000 words on Lech Walesa,
Solidarity and the collapse of Soviet power.

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,595
Jesus Christ!

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,240
You've got two days. Get your head down.

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,392
You better fucking believe
he's getting his head down.

26
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,031
You can say goodbye to sunshine,
Sunshine. You are grounded.

27
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,830
Put it this way.
Let's change and develop. OK?

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,759
Thanks, Tom. We're all very grateful
for this second chance. Aren't we, Mark?

29
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,512
Yes. Thank you very much.

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,070
Oh, yes, my boy!
We're going to do this my way now!

31
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,833
You hear me?
The gravy train has terminated!

32
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,512
Terminated! You lazy little fucker.

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,556
- Mark!
- Did Tony fail this?

34
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,595
No.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,114
No, of course not! And why?
Why didn't he fail it?

36
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,428
He doesn't do history.

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,431
Right!

38
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,318
You are going to get something...
something right,

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,278
if it's the last thing I ever do.
What's your next class?

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,477
- Drama...
- Right. Drama. Home. Coursework.

41
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,233
Fucking perfection! Or else.

42
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,072
Why are you talking
in very short sentences?

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,357
Emphasis! Drama! Fuck off!

44
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,435
Honestly, Sid,
you know this upsets people.

45
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,750
Sorry.

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,195
Just... give it a try, OK?

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,113
OK.

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,158
(Woman) OK, everyone.
Everyone reach.

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,919
(Sid) Oh, Christ...

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,037
(Woman) Reach up.
Stretch out your leaves.

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,351
(Maxxie) That looks so crap, doesn't it?

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,032
Go on.

53
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,473
Fuck that.

54
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,599
Why don't you go to the green
and get stoned instead?

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,432
No. No, you mustn't.

56
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,988
That would be bad. Bad, do you hear?

57
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,200
- And you're a good boy really. Good. Drama.
Fuck it... be bad!

58
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,111
Be good. Drama!

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,315
- Fuck it!
- Drama...

60
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,197
Shut up... will you?

61
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,717
- Pretty nice gear, huh?
- Yeah, very funny.

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,917
- Where you going?
- I gotta go to this lesson.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,831
Fuck it, man.

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,798
- Fuck it?
- Fuck it.

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,108
Yeah, let's go.

66
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,668
(Woman) Right, Donny,
you fart once more and you're out.

67
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,715
Sid?

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,791
Hi. Wow, Maxxie, you look all horny.

69
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,869
You can tell?

70
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,750
Sid... I just wanted to remind you
of our date tonight.

71
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,558
Oh... Shit.

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,997
Thing is, Cass,
my dad kinda grounded me.

73
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,274
I gotta do coursework.

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,079
Oh, wow.

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,718
I was really...

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,880
I didn't eat for three days
so I could be lovely.

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,318
Er, sorry.

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,755
Maybe I'll come over and say hello.

79
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,831
I dunno. Maybe.

80
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,955
Safe.

81
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,473
Wow.

82
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,952
(Maxxie) Go on, give her one.

83
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,917
That would be so bad!

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,231
(Anwar) I bet she bangs
like a ferret on acid!

85
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,356
CHURCH BELLS CHIME

86
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,678
- Hey.
- Hey.

87
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,957
I didn't know which one to get.
They were both so pretty.

88
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,632
Anyway, I got them both.

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,269
What do you think? Which skirt?
This goes with my slutty green top.

90
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,555
This one is more virgin.

91
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,437
Yeah?

92
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,919
Tony? Which skirt?

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,115
Hmm?

94
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,952
Oh, yeah, it's nice.

95
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,669
Are you listening? I'm asking what
to wear to Tribe Of Frog tomorrow?

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,160
Did you ask Chris about pills?

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,151
We can have Mitsubishis.

98
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,912
Is that OK, Tone?

99
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,231
Tone?

100
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,440
Wear that one to Tribe Of Frog,
and that one to my choir concert.

101
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,193
- Choir concert? When?
- Tonight.

102
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,555
You and Sid are coming to hear me sing.

103
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,200
Are we? How come?

104
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,794
It just occurred to me
how much fun it could be.

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,198
Russia... was... a... Superpower...

106
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,476
...and...

107
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,757
Er... Lech Walesa...

108
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,831
was a...

109
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,198
...Polish... Er...

110
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,399
...man... who...

111
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,591
What the fuck did he do? Erm...

112
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,233
Bollocks.

113
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,436
SQUEAKING

114
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,870
CAR APPROACHES

115
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,269
Fuck it.

CLATTERING

117
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,511
Right, you have been warned!

118
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,273
Oh, yes, I warned you!
This is what happens.

119
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,873
No telly.

120
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,838
No stereo.

121
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,549
No... Asian Fanny Fun.

122
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,915
That should be enough
to help you concentrate. Is it?!

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,798
- Yes, Dad.
- Yes. Thank you.

124
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,871
You'll thank me for this one day.

125
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,998
< Oh! Oh, fuck!

126
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,718
CLATTERING

127
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,472
< Ow!

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,913
(Woman) What's happened?

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,037
< I've fallen down
the fucking stairs, you silly cow!

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,633
Bugger.

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,556
HE SIGHS

132
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,036
Ah, for fuck's sake.

133
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,757
Ah, yeah. That's better.

134
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,228
Oh, yeah. Ah, yeah.

135
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,877
I'm just gonna go out
and come back in again. OK?

136
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,678
Would you?

137
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,273
(Oh, fuck!)

138
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,995
KNOCK AT DOOR

139
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,230
- Hello.
- It's Tony!

140
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,550
Yeah, er, come in!

141
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,712
All right, Sid?
Thought you might need a hand.

142
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,473
With your coursework.
Shall we let some air in here?

143
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,471
Yeah.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,514
That's better.
Is that a picture of my girlfriend?

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,309
Wondered where that went.

146
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,470
Right then.

147
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,472
Russia... Lech Walesa...

148
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,754
Jesus, Sid.

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,558
The USSR model could be described
as a relationship

150
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,111
of control and manipulation,
but events in the G...

151
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,155
Gdansk.

152
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,074
...shipyard in the autumn of <i>1980</i>
was the beginning of a...

153
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,355
That's some really good bullshit.

154
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,000
Not a problem. OK, let's go.

155
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,274
Where to?

156
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,873
My choir concert.

157
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,598
Don't tell me you forgot.

158
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,079
I can't. I'm grounded.

159
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,197
Don't be such a fucking vagina.
This is gonna be special.

160
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,316
Anyway, I need someone
to keep Michelle company.

161
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,470
Michelle's coming?

162
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,471
Oh, yes. Nips'll be there.

163
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,028
And you'll wanna see this. Trust me.

164
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,793
Sorry about that.
You won't tell her, will you?

165
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,395
She thinks the world of you, Sid. Really.

166
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,109
And things run their course.
You get bored.

167
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,430
Are you gonna tell me
what you're talking about?

168
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,593
You'd better be doing some fucking work.
Hi, Tony. How's things?

169
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,912
Not bad, Mark. Is that landfill survey finished?
I'd really love to see it sometime.

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,036
Yeah, no problem. Yeah.

171
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,192
Actually, it's quite an interesting
analysis of decomposition rates.

172
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,395
But look, actually, er,
Sid's got some work to do now, so...

173
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,233
OK. Hope to see you very soon, Sid.

174
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,276
Nice to see you, Mark.

175
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,153
- Bye, Liz!
- Bye, Tony!

176
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,832
What?

177
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,717
Why could you not be like...

178
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,271
Why did I?

179
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,635

You know, typically,
episodes of paranoia

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,831
Is there any possible way
I could avoid a kicking?

355
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,673
You could try talking your way out of it.

356
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,069
Um, er... OK. Er...

357
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,478
'Mega Dog to the rescue!'

358
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,198
Em! Come on.
Happy hour down 'Firkin!

359
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,198
Mate? Do you mind?

360
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,748
SIREN BLARES

361
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,833
- Where the fuck have you been!!?
- Dad, I just nipped to the shops.

362
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,148
For three hours?

363
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,468
I got lost.

364
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,951
- My God, Sid, what happened? You're all...
- No, I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

365
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,712
What's that smell?

366
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,109
Er... Piss.

367
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,269
Yours?

368
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,715
Someone else's.

369
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,835
Right.

370
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,275
You were grounded.
You snooked... snook out.

371
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,315
Snuck out.

372
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,472
You snuck out.
You even did a half-arsed job of that.

373
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,472
It might be better to do this
in the morning.

374
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,357
Did you think we wouldn't know?

375
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,795
Did you actually think
that we wouldn't know?!

376
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,199
Dad, you're such a...

377
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,999
Such a what?
Such a... Such a what?

378
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,718
Such a fucking what?
Such a fucking what?!

379
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,438
Dildo.

380
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,711
Oh, fuck the pair of you.

381
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,117
CRASHING

382
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,474
Bed.

383
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,997
Cassie...

384
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,469
What's that smell?

385
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,391
Just piss. What are you doing here, Cass?

386
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,358
- You invited me round.
- Did I?

387
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,715
I've been waiting. Where were you?

388
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,395
- I was out.
- Who with?

389
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,909
Michelle.

390
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,839
Michelle?

391
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,752
Wow.

392
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,230
- Listen, Cass, I've had a bit of a bad night.
- Michelle's so lovely.

393
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,517
<i>Michelle, my girl</i>

394
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,795
<i>I love her, I love her, I love herl</i>

395
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,434
So hey, wow! Fuck you, Sid!

396
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,318
- Cassie, shh! My parents...
- Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

397
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,559
I'm going home.

398
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,394
- No, Cassie...
- Let go... Let go of me!

399
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,149
It's your choice, Sid.

400
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,152
Everything is your choice.

401
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,715
Wake up, Sid.

402
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,914
DOOR SLAMS

403
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,117
Bollocks.

404
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,435
Oh.

405
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,837
Hi, Mum.

406
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,478
How's the face?

407
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,393
- Sore.
- Ahh...

408
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,550
Get in. I'll take you.

409
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,073
Cheers.

410
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,115
'OK!

411
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,715
'Now we're gonna ring up Lee
and we're gonna tell 'im

412
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,588
'that the Government is comin' round
to take 'is babbies away!

413
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,875
'Hello, Lee!'

414
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,879
Mum. Last night...

415
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,349
We were just worried, that's all.

416
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,433
Do you ever feel you know someone,

417
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,195
think you've seen everything
they're gonna do, and then they trump it?

418
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,793
Dad's having a hard time...

419
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,634
- I'm not talking about Dad.
- Oh?

420
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,190
- It's Tony.
- Oh. Tony's lovely.

421
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,035
Thanks, Mum.

422
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,236
Sid, hang on. Close the door.

423
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,553
You know we both really love you.
Don't you, Sid?

424
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,232
I suppose.

425
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,313
I want you to make more of an effort
with your dad in general.

426
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,233
- He's a good guy.
- He doesn't act like one.

427
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,311
Not recently, no.

428
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,188
- But things change, Sid.
- What do you mean?

429
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,679
You...

430
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,036
You need to work out a way
of getting on with him.

431
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,156
It's hard, I know.

432
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,434
OK?

433
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,080
- I'll try.
- Good.

434
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,433
I'm...

435
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,793
Mum?

436
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,035
Yes.

437
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,511
Anyway, have these... For your eye.

438
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,909
Oh, have this, too.

439
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,515
- You eat too much crap.
- Yeah. I know.

440
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,636
Thanks, Mum.

441
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,709
See you later.

442
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,518
Yeah.

443
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,239
See you.

444
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,915
Sid?

445
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,831
Yeah?

446
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,679
Nothing.

447
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,518
<i>Oh, man, what a goddamn mess</i>

448
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,990
<i>Nobody said this was fancy dress</i>

449
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,638
<i>You're lookin' good</i>

450
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,233
<i>Your hair</i>

451
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,073
<i>Where I'm from</i>
<i>you'd be as good as dead</i>

452
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,115
<i>Come on</i>

453
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,272
<i>Get up, get up</i>

454
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,035
<i>Get on, get off all night...</i>

455
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,348
(Tom) Sid?

456
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,839
Sid!

457
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,118
Sunglasses off, please.

458
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,236
OK, everybody, well done.

459
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,311
You've all passed!

460
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,119
Everyone except you, Sid.

461
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,474
Cor, mate! What happened.

462
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,834
Nothing. I'm fine, OK?

463
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,992
You've been fighting, Sid.

464
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,755
That's not
"Changing And Developing". Is it?

465
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,513
24 hours <i>left,</i> OK?

466
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,433
You've either got it or you don't...

467
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,114
You haven't got it. OK?

468
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,111
All right, Tom. Sorry I'm late.

469
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,399
Yo! Last night, man. Cool. Total blast.

470
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,994
Everything you could want
from an evening.

471
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,108
Songs, choirgirls, colourful
costumes, fellatio... Rabbits...

472
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,159
- Rabbits?
- Look, don't ask, man. Yeah, so, Sid...

473
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,276
Woah! Was that Michelle?

474
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,430
No, er, there were these girls...

475
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,351
What kind of girls, Sid?

476
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,998
Big ones.

477
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,513
I thought you was hanging out with Cassie.

478
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,160
Er... Bit of a mix up.

479
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,673
Yeah? Like what?

480
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,797
She was really looking forward to that.

481
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,359
OK, everyone!

482
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,671
Because you've all given it everything,
you can go early.

483
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,193
But use the time wisely, OK?

484
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,999
Woah, woah, woah, sailor!

485
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,753
Not so fast. A little you-me time, yeah?

486
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,038
Sooo...

487
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,633
Coursework?

488
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,598
- Ready for tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'm, like, halfway through.

489
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,558
Sid, there are people here you can talk to.

490
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,200
I am here for you.

491
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,396
We can sort this out.

492
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,152
I'm all ears. Come on.

493
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,271
What? We can sort out the fact that

494
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,079
my best mate wants me to make a move
on his girlfriend, who I love,

495
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,072
even though she still loves him
and now actually hates me?

496
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,948
My Dad thinks I'm a complete fuck-up,
and can't stop acting like a fuck-up

497
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,953
and no matter what I try,
I can't stop pissing everyone off?

498
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,270
We can sort that out, can we?

499
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,156
OK. OK, yeah.

500
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,993
Give me a moment to, um...

501
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,150
Life, Sid.

502
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,313
There are lots of ups and downs, OK?

503
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,719
It is like a...

504
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,351
It's like a... bird, flying.

505
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,749
Find your wings, Sid.

506
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,035
Right.

507
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,680
And do your fucking coursework.
Otherwise you're fucked.

508
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,557
Yeah. Thanks, Tom. That sorts it.

509
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,279
Pas de probleme, Sidney.
So see you tomorrow.

510
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,397
Don't leave me hanging, G.

511
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,159
Safe!

512
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,440
- Hey. All go according to plan?
- No.

513
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,193
- Ho! That girl can really swing.
- No.

514
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,953
Your mistake, my friend,
was making your move too quickly.

515
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,995
What?

516
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,277
Yes, grasshopper. Sensei say
that boy must wait 12 hours

517
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,475
before he approach girl on rebound.

518
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,630
This is fucked up, Tone!

519
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,870
Isn't it?

520
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,679
- Don't you want her?
- I told you. It's a <i>gift.</i>

521
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,990
You fucking freak me out sometimes.

522
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,433
But it's never dull. Is it?

523
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,995
No.

524
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,709
Ring her. Take her for a drink,
and see what happens.

525
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,032
What's the worst that can happen?
It's your choice, dude. Your choice.

526
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,994
Ah, fuck.

527
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,555
'Hello?'

528
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,596
Hi, Michelle. It's Sid.

529
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,955
- 'Fuck off. I don't want to speak to you.'
- 'Chelle...

530
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,519
'You heard me!'

Please. I wanna make it up to you.

535
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,035
- 'Fuck off.'
- Can I talk to you?

536
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,678
'Talk about what? I don't want to.'

537

Gone? What do you mean, "gone"?

604
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,995
She packed a bag
and went to Auntie Rosie's.

605
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,150
Something she "has to do".

606

Oh, God, no, no.

610
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,158
So she's just not living here
or talking to you any more?

00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,959
Yeah.

612
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,157
Right.

613
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,555
She said to tell you "sorry".

Isn't her fault, is it?

619
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,113
