Let's try the concerto now.
It's such a lovely competition piece.

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,629
Do you think you can handle it?

18
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,119
Dunno.

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,272

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,239
Oh, hi, Doug.

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,072
Can I have a word?

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,275
Sure. What's up?

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,512
Um... We've had a couple
of complaints about the orchestra.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,835
Well, the brass section is a little rough

26
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,433
but then Gershwin's deceptively difficult.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,273
No, no, no.
It's more of a... a language problem

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,952
with, well, with the swearing.

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,635
Swearing?

30
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,269
Yes. I was listening outside and
there was quite a bit of swearing.

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,113
Oh, well,
I'll have a word with them. OK?

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,798
It's just...

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,835
Yes.

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,912
- No problem.
- Fine. Thanks.

No, I... Well done.

37
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,439
And you'll sort out the swearing?

38
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,238
I'll get to the bottom of it, Doug.

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,550
Yes. Thank you.

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,236

HE LAUGHS UNEASILY
What?

126
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,834
Oh, is it that obvious?

127
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,629
She's your best friend's girlfriend,
Sid, and it's a little bit weird.

128
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,438
How's this gonna happen?

129
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,795
Um... Well, OK, right,

130
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,075
we're out, yeah, and she is drunk,

131
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,392
you know, totally mentalled
and mistakes me for Tony in the dark,

132
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,392
and her hands are everywhere.

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,712
Everywhere - all over my body

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,395

my tongue's double jointed.

135
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,677
But by then it's too late
and we go at it like animals until...

136
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,311

- Well, don't ask if you don't want to know.

I'll put you in your place
with my blatant sexism

181
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,877
Take my hench piece
out of my larder

182
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,599
Cos to me "No" means "Yes"
and "Yes" means...

183
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,669
(All) Harder!

184
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,751

Tupac and Biggie RIP

187
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,314
Tupac and Biggie
got more money than me

188
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,595
(All) Even though they're dead...

191
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,990
Hi, Jayvon. Where's the boss?

192
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,998
Nice dress.

193
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,428
- No, I like it. It's... It's brown.
- Oh, thanks, Jayvon. And it's green.

194
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,078
Is it? Are you sure?

195
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,392
Oh, fuck it, I dunno.

196
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,869
(Man) Check this out.
I put on the music,

197
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,190
- playing some Marvin Gaye...
- Dad?

198
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,748
- Dad.
- I said, "You don't know Marvin?"

199
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,353
Jal. What's happening?

200
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,635
Hey, it's the blessed child.

201
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,395
I can't practise because my fucking brothers
are banging out dumb hip-hop.

202
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,993
Boys need practice too.

203
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,674
Yeah, them boys need plenty of practice,
you know what I'm saying?

204
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,230
For sure, cos those pussies are bad.
And I mean <i>fucking</i> bad.

205
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,151
They're doing their ting.

206
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,276
We didn't sound so cool way back when.

207
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,113
Yes, but we had tune. And you had talent.

208
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,998
Maybe you lost it.

209
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,833
Ooh. You hear that?
"Maybe you lost it."

210
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,190
Ronny, um,
I don't think you introduced me.

211
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,556
No? Um, yeah, Jal, this is Alicia.

212
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,198
Hi.

213
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,751
I'm so excited. Your dad's
going to remix one of my tracks for me.

214
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,590
Yeah? Has he shown you
his special slider yet?

215
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,113
Ooh!

216
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,111
No, not yet.

LAUGHTER

218
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,479
I've got my competition on Saturday.
Not that you care.

219
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,479
Rooty tooty music.
Maybe you like dancing for whitey.

220
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,796
If you say so, Dad. Nice to meet you.

221
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,995
LAUGHTER

222
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,073
Oh, shite!
She get you, man. She get you good!

223
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,674
What? What's wrong?

224
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,716
She's got some serious attitude.

225
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,870
And she's looking more like
her mother every day.

226
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,474
- Ain't that the truth.
- Two time.

227
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,357
So what? So this girl got a sister? >

228
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,476

Yeah. No, I bought one.

232
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,912
'What colour is it?'

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
- Green.
- 'Is it nice?'

234
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,312
Fucking horrible, of course.

235
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,118
'Sorry!'

236
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,918
You don't sound very sorry.

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,989
'Oh, stop it!'

238
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,230
What's that noise. Is he?

239
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,992
'You know, he's just h-hanging out.'

240
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,709
Yeah. Ring me back when you aren't
actually being penetrated, OK?

241
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,711
Jesus!

242
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,276

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,314
She ain't even that buff.

262
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,550
Cool.

263
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,110
Um, Jal. I thought maybe I could use
your flute on one of my tracks.

264
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,513
Where you going, sister?
I ain't no choong.

Watch your lip. You, too.

They're just messing with you, sweetness.

Jal here. Straightaway, please.

284

Right there. Off you go.

Jal... Jalander?

291
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,355
Jal is fine.

292
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,192
OK.

293
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,911
Doug.

294
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,228
You all right?

295
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,629
Little bit hot in here.

296
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,193
Is it?

297
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,794
Anyway, um, Jal.

298
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,749
We're just delighted that
we've produced such a talented pupil.

299
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,070
Right. It was Claire, really.

300
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,833
So, we'd like you to do
a couple of interviews.

301
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,314
We want to celebrate
this amazing achievement

302
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,992
for a girl of your background.

303
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,433
Pardon?

304
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,988
And, uh, I've prepared a checklist

305
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,471
of ways in which we've helped you
to overcome your handicaps.

306
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,233
A sort of aide-memoire, so to speak.

307
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,675
Sorry, handicaps?

308
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,638
And when you talk to the television,

309
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,837
I'd like you to mention
the college's upcoming bid

310
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,673
for Working Towards Sustaining Excellence

311
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,638
under the Everything's Getting Better initiative.

312
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,597
It's all terribly important.

313
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,030
It's for people like you. OK, Jal?

314
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,430
(Doug) So, you've got
the Evening Post at three.

315
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,149
Then This Morning with
bubbly Fern Britton at half past,

316
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,835
followed by Blue Peter.
Then Channel 4.

317
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,478
They're ironic, OK?

318
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,754
Um...

319
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,037
Finally, we don't like people
to get disappointed...

320
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,348
In what?

321
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,396
The competition.

322
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,675
We don't like disappointment, do we, Doug?

323
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,595
So I've prepared a checklist of things
to think when you lose.

324
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,720
As long as you've done your best.

325
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,438
That's the main thing.

326
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,473
Thanks for the advice.

327
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,914
Right. Let's go for it.

328
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,549
Go, Jal. Kick it. Let's rock!

329
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,269
Inspirational. That's what we're all about.

330
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,918
(Man) 'So if you win,
will we see you in the charts?

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,035
'No.

332
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,078
(Man) 'Right. And your family,
they must be very proud of you.

333
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,115
'No.

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,599
(Man) 'Uh... are they musical too?

335
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,874
'No.

336
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,952
(Man) 'Um... Right. Um...

337
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,917
'Have you decided what you are
going to wear on the big night?

338
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,433
'No.

339
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,317
(Man) 'OK, and, uh, who's the best...'

340
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,960
You don't exactly put out, do you, girl?

341
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,995
What?

342
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,877
'Wayne Osmond...'

343
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,793
Do you have to be
so fucking sulky all the time?

344
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,154
I'm not.

345
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,791
(Man) 'So tell me about the clarinet.
It's a kind of flute, isn't it?

346
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,952
'No. It's a single reed
woodwind instrument...'

347
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,110
If I was on telly, I'd make an effort.

348
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,394
Look at you.

349
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,357
(Man) 'Will you take a lucky mascot
on stage with you?

350
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,714
'No.

351
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,835
(Man) 'Well, lots of luck with that...'

352
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,911
And this.

353
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,190
I mean, fucking hell.

354
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,350
Why?

355
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,271
- I dunno. It fitted.
- How much?

356
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,112
14 quid.

357
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,910
- For fuck's sake. It's brown.
- It's not. It's green.

358
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,877
I suit green.

359
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,713
- I paid good money for that.
- You did not.

360
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,712
Jesus, 'Chelle. I can't wear that stuff.

361
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,678
Shut up. You, girl, need to learn a few tricks.

362
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,954
Like what?

363
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,635
- Like looking good. It's what I do.
- It isn't all you do.

364
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,473
Yeah, it is. You play clarinet
and I look shaggable.

365
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,829
It's talent, girl. Pure talent.

366
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,110
Now, come on. Off.

367
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,157
Sorry, mate. Record company showcase.
Over 21s tonight.

368
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,397
Well, I'm 21.
We're all 21. Aren't we, lads?

369
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,357
- Definitely.
- Yup. He's an old one, he is.

370
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,078
ID?

371
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,957
There you go. Check it out.

372
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,278
I know, takes years off me.

373
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,873
But I had to cut it off.

374
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,793
It kept getting caught in
the girlfriend's piercing.

375
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,029
Anyway, shall we go in?

376
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,758
Yup, might as well.

377
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,594
Fuck off before I stick this
so far up your arse,

378
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,877
your teeth come out of
your eyeballs. All right?

379
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,393
OK.

380
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,075
Look I just don't want to disappoint
my colleague, Dr Makabi.

381
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,878
He's visiting from Senegal.

382
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,235
Katinga.

383
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,788
Gotta warn you, he's got some
serious voodoo shit going on.

384
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,438
You mean like this?

385
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,756
Yeah. Like that.

386
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,478
Bit more subtle.

387
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,232
Fuck off.

388
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,993
We're out. Let's get outta here, man.

389
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,593
It's all right, Danny.

390
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,432
They can come in with me.

391
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,115
Woah.

392
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,350
Jal? Is that you in there?

393
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,635
My dad'll put them
on the guest list. OK?

394
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,031
Cheers, bruv.

395
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,315
Your shit really good!

396
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,635
For Christ's sake. Stop looking at them.

397
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,952
Sorry Jal.

398
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,315
They're a bit...
Well, they're out, aren't they?

399
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,550
You're gay, for Christ sakes.

400
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,870
Yeah...

401
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,234
I mean, yeah, of course.

402
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,632
And you're supposed to respect
women's bodies, Muslim boy.

403
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,632
I'm respecting.

404
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,473
Believe me, I'm respecting.

405
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,394
Are those? I mean,
what's keeping it all up? Is that...

406
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,436
Don't touch.

407
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,399
But I wanna touch.
Honestly, I'll die if I don't touch.

408
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,838
So who's buying us a drink?

409
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,831
- I will.
- It's on me.

410
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,718
- I'll get a pitcher.
- I'll buy you both a drink.

411
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,916
I'm going for a wee.

412
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,838
Nice work.

413
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,911
And I look...

414
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,639
Yeah, yeah. Cool.

415
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,153
I'll catch you later, yeah?

416
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,272
I don't know where she's been
hiding it. Yeah, honestly.

417
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,951
- Nice. Miss Obu?
- Huh?

418
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,589
The dress. It's Miss Obu.
I love that cut.

419
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,240
Oh. Thanks.

420
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,753
Can I get you a drink?

421
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,990
Um. I think my friends...

422
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,071
Oh, no problem. Maybe in a while.

423
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,354
You look lovely.

424
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,874
Oh. Cool.

425
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,069
What is he doing with the posh bitch?

426
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,469
Talking.

427
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,232
What? Like we're talking?

428
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,038
I dunno, Michelle.

429
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,475
Yeah, talking.

430
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,471
Just talking.

431
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,433
I know you fancy me.

432
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,954
I...

433
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,758
Oh, Christ.

434
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,479
I love you, Sid.

435
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,709
But more like a...

436
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,360
- Please.
- Brother and sister thing.

437
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,635
Oh, fuck.

438
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,390
- One for luck.
- Yeah, yeah.

439
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,514
We could be like
a Welsh brother and sister.

440
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,591
You know, locked up in the farmhouse

441
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,913
with nothing but the sheep
and our abusive father. Yeah, yeah.

442
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,911
Funny, Sid.

443
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,679
Hi.

444
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,194
Oh, hi.

445
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,475
Um, wow, hi.

446
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,471
I got you a pint.

447
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,993
Great.

448
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,156
Cheers. I need to be drunk.

449
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,552
HE BELCHES

450
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,189
Oh, fine. Wow, it's nothing.

451
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,314
I said, let me hear some noise!

452
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,119

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,837

Want some cash.

Yo, yo, yo, yo.
You know he's not gonna come.

JUNGLE MUSIC PLAYS

478
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,308
Seen Michelle?

479
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,597
Went home with Tony.
What are you doing?

480
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,356
- Comforting you.
- What about?

481
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,750
Come on. Forget her, Sid.

482
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,799
Is there anybody in this club that
doesn't know I've got a thing for Michelle?

483
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,029
No.

484
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,312
How comforting are you feeling?

485
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,918
- You know I love you, Sid, but...
- Oh, don't you fucking start. Jesus.

486
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,157
Hey. You said I could buy you a drink.

487
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,832
Bar's closed.

488
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,434
Yeah, but my mate's
just opened a club up the road.

489
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,115
- It's a nice place. You wanna join me?
- I don't think so.

490
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,349
Come on.

491
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,237
It's such a pretty dress.

492
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,197
Shame to waste it.

493
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,114
Tell you what, bring your friend for a drink
then I'll get you a cab. Promise.

494
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,475
Sid?

495
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,994
OK. Sure. Why not?

496
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,753
Yeah. Let's get out of this place.

497
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,953
- So what's your name?
- Jal. Jalander.

498
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,918
Cool name.

499
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,719
- And what do you do, Jalander?
- I play the clarinet.

500
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,396
- Oh, yeah. You any good?
- I'm fucking good.

501
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,152
Let's get a taxi, yeah?

502
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,473
Jal?

503
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,632
- What the fuck?!
- Hello, Sidney.

504
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,597
Oh, God.

505
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,636
(Jal) What the fuck?! Let go!

506
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,278
Shut up.

507
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,908
My associate, William, here,
he's been following you.

508
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,357
I mean, let's face it.
You owe me a lorra, lorra money.

509
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,313
It's the principle, isn't it?

510
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,960
Isn't it?

511
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,158
I give you spliff on easy credit
and you don't pay.

512
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,674
In fact, you actively don't pay me!

513
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,912
So now, now we're down
to consequences.

514
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,357
- Leave him alone!
- Shut up. Shut up!

515
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,112
I take credit cards.

516
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,433
I'll take them now.

517
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,793
Thank you.

518
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,155
Yours, an all.

519
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,389
I don't have one.

520
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,072
Oh.

521
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,354
Well, what do you have?

522
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,914
Ah, yeah. Goods of value.

523
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,991
Listen, have everything
in my account, yeah?

524
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,632
Smart arse,
give me your PIN number, now.

525
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,030

526
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,277
Well, thank you very much.

527
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,430
Oh, yeah look at that.

528
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,953
Now that...

529
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,597
...is a mighty fine body.

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,120
HE PLAYS EXPERTLY

531
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,192

- Please, I need that.
- I know, I know, I know,

533
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,075
but, er, if there's no funds
in young Sidney's coffers

534
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,232
or if Sidney has made
the schoolboy error of giving me...

535
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,952
...the wrong number...

536
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,990
then you need to understand how
dreadfully upset that is gonna make me.

537
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,956
Hey, that's the kind of guy that I am.

538
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,519
You fucking bastards! I'll get you!

539
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,874
You bastards! You bastards!

540
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,075
You tolling on our sis!!

541
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,879
Waste him!

542
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,599
(Jal) No!

543
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,310
It's not him.
He's helping me, you twats!

544
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,676
- God, they smashed my clarinet.
- What?

545
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,193
Them!

546
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,634
We go and get them good, sis!

547
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,280
Oh, God, they smashed my clarinet.

548
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,596
- Donald's not your brother, right?
- No.

549
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,113
Just checking.

550
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,478
(Woman) 'Really, are you all right?'

551
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,438
I'm sorry, Claire. I should never
have been carrying it.

552
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,034
'Don't even think about that,
as long as you are all right.'

553
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,270
- Yeah.
- 'Just stop beating yourself up, OK?'

554
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,590
- Yeah.
- 'I'll sort it in the morning.'

555
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,194
- So you'll ring them?
- 'Yes, I'll ring them tomorrow.'

556
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,599
OK.

557
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,355
- 'Right. Get some rest.'
- Thanks.

558
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,998
Look don't worry about it, Jal.

559
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,389
I'll phone you later.
We'll work something out, OK?

560
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,392
- 'AII right. Thanks, Claire.'
- All right, bye.

561
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,313
Poor girl.

562
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,038
It wasn't insured.

563
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,157
Can't you get her another?

564
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,357
We'll try, but it's not just any clarinet.
It cost thousands.

565
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,714
Oh, dear.

566
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,279
But later, yeah?

567
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,794
Yeah. Later.

568
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,429
Yeah. I'll make some phone calls.
Maybe we can borrow one and...

569
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,636
Ah, holy shit!

570
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,076
Take me you fucking
Welsh stud monkey!

571
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,192
< We caught those blood claat scum
easy, man. Easy.

572
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,153
We going to jack them.
Real chief 'em up. >

573
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,877
And that's when they go all
Hong Kong Phooey.

574
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,791
They waste us.

575
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,393
Waste us, man.

576
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,879
With sticks!

577
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,035
Make us look like
chi chi men and ting.

578
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,351
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean you to do that.

579
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,476
< Ah, it's nothing, sis.

580
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,152
Nothing at all.

581
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,356
Got couple of licks on them still.

582
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,033
Thank you.

583
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,117
Is there anything I can do?

584
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,229
I'd like a lips from Michelle.

585
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,431
- Huh?
- He wants a kiss.

586
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,351
Me, too.

587
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,113
Me, too.

588
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,875
Please. Please.

589
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,350
PHONE RINGS

590
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,279
Hey, boy.

591
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,794
How you feeling?

592
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,592
Yeah.

593
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,989
I know you took a beating.

594
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,832
Your sister's grateful.

595
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,592
I know it.

596
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,319
You did good.

597
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,073
Yeah. I'll come down again in an hour.

598
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,478
I love you, too. I love you all.

599
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,516
Even that 'tupid white boy.

600
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,800
I'm inspired, I'm offline

601
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,236
A renegade, disturbing the peace
while I'm spitting the serenade

602
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,550
All this tension, miscomprehension

603
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,949
I'm informed and on the level
that I might mention

604
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,712
That when I scream it's just passion

605
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,155
I ain't angry at culture
I ain't angry at fashion

606
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,676
And I might sound spiteful
if I feel shit's epidemic

607
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,354
I admit that some is soul
but some is academic

608
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,715
I been doing this forever
So why you choosing now?

609
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,030
Turning your face away
is a punch in the gut, pow

610
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,314
So, swing a rhyme of time

611
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,834
Like the dove, sing of love
and keep your peace

612
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,639
Cos I got kin
I got skin to think of.

613
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,956
Why you listening to me, girl?

614
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,514
Don't you talk to me through glass!

615
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,033
Nobody's supposed to come in here.
This is my...

616
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,395
Why don't you ask me how I am, Dad?

617
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,674
I got beat on.

618
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,950
It's not my fault.

619
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,270
It's not my fault I look like her.

620
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,394
She's gone. Deal with it. We have.

621
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,948
- Ah, girl...
- You're wasting it.

622
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,871
Wasting what you've got.

623
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,552
Don't blame me.

624
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,433
Don't be coming in my places, girl.

625
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,795
Your room is a tip. Tidy it!

626
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,474
- What?
- Tidy it.

627
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,673
OK?

628
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,557
Slow through the adagio. Slow.

629
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,868
Or I'll paddle your...

630
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,154
BUZZER
...fucking ass.

631
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,754
(Man) 'Standby.
They're ready for you on stage.'

632
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,152
APPLAUSE

633
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,758
ORCHESTRA STARTS UP

634
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,595
Woah!

635
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,911
- Watch what you're fucking doing, pal.
- Get in, man.

636
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,433
- What?
- Get in.

637
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,558
Get your fucking hands off!

638
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,595
Oi!

639
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,591
Watch my fucking gear! Get off!

640
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,557
ORCHESTRA CONTINUES TO PLAY
