1
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,835
(Man) Blessed are those who can give

2
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,630
without remembering,
and take without forgetting.

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,153
Amen.

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,593
(Mum) Amen.

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,072
Thanks, Effy, but you know this is
the best birthday present I could have.

6
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,072
A nice family meal.

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,515
A chance to have a bit of quality time.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,909
Ah, isn't that lovely?

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,234
Ha, you know, this reminds me of when
I was a boy and my Auntie Mabel,

10
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,673
when she was carving the chicken,

11
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,719
she always used to wear
these loose-fitting tops...

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,756
Yes, I think we've all heard this one,
haven't we?

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,149
It's a joke, Anthea, an anecdote.

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,836
And my dad,
your grandfather, God rest his soul,

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,639
"What would you like, David?"
She used to say,

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,676
and he'd look right down her front and say,

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,719
"I'd like breast, please,
and then maybe a bit of leg and stuffing."

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,315
LAUGHS AWKWARDLY

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,952
I mean, he'd basically growl at her.
You see, that's a difficult dad.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,716
- No-one thinks you're difficult, Jim.
- Ha! And then Mabel would get to me.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,472
Ah, what could I ask for?

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,588
I scoured my brain and came up with,
"Thigh, please, Mabel."

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,673
I basically asked for the only thing
I could think of that was non-sexual.

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,672
- Thigh!
- Thighs can be sexy.

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,038
That's not true.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,759
You'd be surprised,
you can do a lot with thighs, Dad.

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,274
No, you can't.

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,272
CARVING KNIFE WHIRS

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,553
Look, I'm sorry.
What is so sexy about thighs?

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,949
I mean, what on earth
can you do with a thigh?

31
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,474
Please not... Not in front of Effy, Jim.

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,713
All right. What would everyone like?

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,233
A bit of thigh, please, Dad.

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,519
No! Not yet! Did I say do it yet?

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,034
No, look, Jim! Effy's rolled a five.

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,591
Oh, yes, well, er, right, well, jolly good.

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,716
All right, we'll treat that as your go, Effy.

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,069
Er, so you got a five... Oh, God,
I can't understand these rules.

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,833
They've translated them from Korean.

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,672
SIGHS HEAVILY

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,797
Jim, maybe we shouldn't play a game.

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,314
Fine. Fucking fine.

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,078
Fucking, fucking fine.

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,639
So what shall we do, then?

45
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,199
Just sit, shall we?

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,115
Yes, we can just sit, yeah,
and I'll see if I can find some nice...

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,633
biscuits, OK?

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,229
Oh, I hate it when your mother's like this.

49
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,917
(On TV) - Help me!
- What's wrong?

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,752
Any luck with it?

51
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,193
Never mind.

52
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,759
Good night, love.

53
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,831
Night, sweetheart.

54
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,948
(On TV) There's nothing there.
What's wrong?

55
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,393
RINGING TONE

56
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,436
(Chris) 'Tony.
You all right, man? How's it going?'

57
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,238
What's everyone doing tonight?

58
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,914
'Um, well, there's a few people
coming round to mine.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,754
'But it's a homework thing, really.'

60
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,273
Is Michelle coming?

61
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,830
'Yeah. Yeah, but it's for a class
that you're not in...

62
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,353
'Um...

63
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,192
'Er... biology...

64
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,998
'You're not in it.'

65
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,833
It's fine, Chris.
I'm not invited, right?

66
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,639
'I just... I don't think you'd enjoy it, really.
You know?'

67
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,358
Yeah. I know.

68
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,279
(Sid) 'I'm asleep or just too bored
to speak to you, so leave a message.'

69
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,477
Is this now officially silent treatment
you're giving me?

70
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,632
Michelle broke up with me, remember?

71
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,554
Still, if you think this is gonna piss me off,
then you're wrong.

72
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,870
I actually quite like it.

73
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,919
I'm just gonna keep on filling up
your voicemail with all sorts of shit...

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,752
(Jim) I'm never neurotic.

75
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,276
Dads always check up on their baby girls,
that's what we do.

76
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,148
Look, she's asleep.
Come on, let's go to bed.

77
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,196
Bed? But it's early.

78
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,713
Panorama.

79
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,828
I don't think that I've given you
<i>my</i> birthday present yet.

80
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,388
- Auntie Mabel?
- Mmm.

81
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,869
Actually, she was a neighbour,
not a real blood relative.

82
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,633
I know exactly what she was.

83
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,191
I'll fetch the turkey baster
and you... wash your bits.

84
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,830
(Maxxie) 'I dunno. I'm probably not even going.

85
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,353
'You're breaking up, Tony.'

86
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,829
FAKES INTERFERENCE

87
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,838
(Jal) 'She doesn't want to see you, Tony.
Leave us alone.'

88
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,316
(Girl) I wasn't sure what to wear.

89
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,749
Can you believe I borrowed
this top from my mum?

90
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,753
Though Davey, when I wore
my mum's fishnets to the school disco thing,

91
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,229
said that was well rough
cos women used to wear fishnets

92
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,754
without knickers at orgies or whatever,

93
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,354
so, like, my mum would have got stuff on it.

94
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,035
Davey calls it lady juice.
Can you believe he called it lady juice?

95
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,317
And he says by wearing the tights,
her stuff would have rubbed off on me.

96
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,594
Though I wore knickers,

97
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,389
and I don't think my mum
went to many orgies.

98
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,914
I mean, she grew up in Luton.

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,958
I don't think many orgies happen in Luton.

100
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,870
Don't! He's gross!

101
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,636
I'm a bit scared. Are you scared, Effy?

102
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,154
I keep tasting sick in my mouth.

103
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,234
I think it's cos I'm excited and nervous.
Do you ever get that?

104
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,630
Tasting sick in your mouth,
like you've got hiccups but you haven't.

105
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,676
Do you ever get that, Effy?

106
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,478
Do you?

107
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,711
Did I tell you about Davey
trying to finger me?

108
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,118
Effy! You came!

109
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,159
I mean, cool, I mean...
I wasn't sure you would.

110
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,955
Hi.

111
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,476
It's my last day
and they're fucking wankers to work for.

112
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,269
So you know, break, take, steal...

113
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,955
Anarchy and all that. Mad.

114
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,670
So this is it? Really?

115
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,912
Oh, this is Spencer. A mate of mine.

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,278
Hi, I'm Julie and this is Effy.
Do people call you Spence?

117
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,952
No. They don't.

118
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,190
I've heard a lot about you, Effy.
Not all of it good.

119
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,510
You heard anything about me?

120
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,830
Wanna ride?

121
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,678
Shall I get on too?

122
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,716
We're here together!

123
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,873
- Big Issue!
- Bit late for you, isn't it, Kenny?

124
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,757
Last week's edition.

125
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,308
Drunks are usually
too generous to notice.

126
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,674
Who you out with?

127
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,274
On my own tonight. Listen,
you don't fancy a beer?

128
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,079
Sorry, beer's not really my drink.

129
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,948
Now, once you've tasted a Pinot Grigio,
hops just lose their allure.

130
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,156
Right, OK.

131
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,752
Do you want a hand... selling?

132
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,229
Where's all your mates, then, Tone?

133
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,197
Fallen on hard times, have you?

134
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,794
Something like that.

135
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,519
Well, no offence,
but the sooner I get these sold,

136
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,875
the sooner I can get home
to the missus for cocoa and cuddles.

137
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,829
And I'm not going to get much sold
standing next to a posh lad, am I?

138
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,593
Right. OK. No worries.

139
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,874
See you later.

140
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,188
Ta-ta.

141
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,273
Big Issue, fella?

142
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,589
SIREN WAILS

143
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,036
(Spencer) It's the fucking cops!

144
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,675
Do you think they'll give us a joint cell?

145
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,591
MOBILE RINGS

146
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,635
Hello.

147
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,358
'This is Police Sergeant Bill Hughes.

148
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,032
'Am I speaking to Tony Stonem?'

149
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,519
What?

150
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,637
<i>Clifton</i> Branch police station.
Marjorie Watts. How may I help you?

151
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,917
- Um...
- Sorry, I rushed it. I'll go again.

152
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,433
<i>Clifton</i> Branch police station.

153
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,476
Marjorie Watts. How can I help you?

154
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,914
Hi, Marjorie. I'm here to pick up
Elizabeth Stonem. She's been arrested.

155
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,991
Okey-dokey. I'll check that for you.

156
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,356
Just missed her.
Her brother's picked her up already.

157
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,032
- I'm her brother.
- Her other brother.

158
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,075
I'm her only brother.

159
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,199
OK, her boyfriend pretending to be
her brother's picked her up already.

160
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,113
She just <i>left</i> with a fat lad.

161
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,510
Ladies, your carriage awaits.
Come on, chop-chop.

162
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,034
Effy! Eff...

163
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,796
ENGINE STARTS

164
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,755
That was fun.

165
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,637
Unexpected, but fun.

166
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,917
- So fucking hard to keep a straight face.
- You did well for a fat fuck.

167
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,434
You're so lucky, Effy.
I can't believe it.

168
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,035
Remember when I tried to get arrested
for kissing that police officer?

169
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,759
Normally I would have been with her.

170
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,752
We're always getting into trouble
together at school. Tell them...

171
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,558
Does she ever stop?

172
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,834
Anyone want some?

173
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,955
What is it?

174
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,794
(Julie) We're known as the cheeky girls.

175
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,077
Not that we're Romanian or,
you know, show off our pants!

176
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,394
(Spencer) 'Hi, this is Effy's phone.
She's currently cruising

177
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,756
'at 35,000 feet and there's
definitely turbulence ahead.'

178
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,718
What? It's, uh... Tony.

179
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,553
Effy? What's going on?

180
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,876
SIRENS WAIL

181
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,115
Look, oi! Can we get
some concentration here, please?

182
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,556
I know it seems hard, right,
but think about it.

183
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,031
This - this could lead to,
you know, celebrity.

184
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,476
A place in the Guinness Book Of Records
is hardly celebrity.

185
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,994
But it is!
Right, I fucking love that book!

186
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,638
Will you stop eating the tools?

187
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,316
It's not my fault you decided
to go for sugar cube pyramids.

188
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,436
Oh, hi.

189
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,270
What's this -
some kind of retro LSD thing?

190
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,397
Oh, no. It's kinda that homework thing
I was telling you about...

191
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,677
The, er... biology.

192
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,838
Hi, Michelle.

193
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,953
Hello, Tony.

194
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,635
Look, don't worry, I'm not gonna stay.
I just needed Sid for a minute.

195
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,395
- I'm busy.
- Yeah, I can see that, Sid.

196
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,351
Go on.

197
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,795
Let's have a go, then.

198
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,077
Ah...

199
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,479
Ah...

200
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,153
Fucking hell, guys, you know
how to have a good time, don't you?

201
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,549
I don't want this to be difficult.

202
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,914
If you want to stay, you can stay.

203
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,790
No, it's fine. You made the divorce terms clear
and I intend to stick to them.

204
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,359
Please don't be a bastard.

205
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,351
Look, don't get so upset about it, OK?

206
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,309
I'm sorry I spoilt your beautiful evening.
I'll go. Sid?

207
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,315
Well, go on, then.

208
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,231
Go see what he wants.

209
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,231
Don't feel you have to, Sid.

210
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,755
I'm gonna go.

211
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,752
But only to tell him to leave, right?

212
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,113
You should leave, Tony.
No-one wants you here.

213
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,189
Shit!

214
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,919
You OK?

215
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,037
I tried ringing, but you haven't
answered your phone all week.

216
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,998
- Did you get beaten up?
- Effy's missing. We need to look for her.

217
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,038
Effy? Is this another one of your games?

218
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,918
Yeah, Sid, it's a game.

219
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,196
'Hi, this is Effy's phone.
She's currently cruising

220
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,794
'at 35,000 feet and there's
definitely turbulence ahead.'

221
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,438
This sounds a bit weird, Tony.

222
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,273
It's fine. We'll nick your dad's car,
drive around a bit,

223
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,351
spot her, take her home,
we can go for a pint.

224
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,629
Shit!

225
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,789
What?

226
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,915
It's Cassie.

227
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,039
- She was there.
- So where's she gone?

228
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,159
Flown off on her broomstick?
She's still in the loony bin.

229
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,958
No, she was there.

230
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,998
Maybe she's haunting you,
cos she tried to kill herself because of you.

231
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,273
Hang on.
You want to nick my dad's car?

232
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,790
Why can't we nick your dad's instead?

233
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,919
Because, Sid, my dad has central locking,
a sophisticated alarm system

234
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,468
and probably thinks a spell
in prison would do me good.

235
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,950
Whereas your dad has a 20-year-old car,
Neighbourhood Watch

236
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,519
and won't prosecute.

237
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,159
LAUGHTER

238
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,358
I bet you ten quid I know
who you're thinking about.

239
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,557
There's times I think me and Tony
are gonna get back together.

240
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,108
And just like that, I'm ten quid richer.

241
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,633
There's a sort of thing, though,
isn't there? First loves?

242
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,472
You think Tony loves you?

243
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,309
No, I don't.

244
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,358
Sorry, that sounded
far less harsh in my head.

245
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,078
Don't worry about it.

246
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,354
Michelle.

247
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,310
Wait up. Listen, I'm off to a late-nighter
at the sports club. Fancy coming? A quick drink?

248
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,277
- Can you not take a hint?
- Come on.

249
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,238
You must have worked out by now
that I didn't do it.

250
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,995
You had porno pictures
of your sister on your phone.

251
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,559
How fucked up are you?

252
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,076
- Someone set me up!
- Yeah, right, Josh.

253
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,355
Look, the party'll be a laugh.

254
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,672
Michelle! Please!

255
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,913
Fuck it. Go.

256
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,353
Good decision.

257
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,556
Fucked-up is an understatement.

258
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,952
He's got nice wheels, though...
for a nutter.

259
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,995
Shut up!

260
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,472
- (Spencer) Home!
- (Kevin) This place is fucking brilliant.

261
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,028
(Julie) It's like Wonkaland.

262
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,395
(Spencer) This is where
the rich kids come to die.

263
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,271
Welcome to my world.

264
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,116
I feel a bit rough!

265
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,670
Kevin, I think you should take
Julie to the bathroom.

266
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,432
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

267
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,358
Finally, we're alone.

268
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,714
Not quite.

269
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,068
Jesus Christ.

270
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,072
Fuck! I wondered
when you were going to turn up.

271
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,596
Hello, Effy. I'm Jesus Christ.

272
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,989
Anything?

273
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,149
Nothing.

274
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,117
Bollocks!

275
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,558
You know, she may be having a bit of fun,
a joke at your expense.

276
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,154
That's not her style.

277
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,151
No, I know Effy.

278
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,276
She's cleverer than this.

279
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,476
In fact, she's the cleverest
fucking person I know.

280
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,074
I don't know anyone like her.

281
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,037
(Sid) Cass?

282
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,755
Look, I'm worried about her.

283
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,991
I just... Even if we're looking
in the same places twice...

284
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,752
- Cassie, she was...
- Please, Sid?

285
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,673
OK.

286
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,513
MOBILE RINGS

287
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,192
- Effy?
- (Josh) 'Hey, Tone.

288
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,669
'You've gotta come to this party
down at Cumberland Basin.

289
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,591
'We're flying the virgin highway.'

290
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,990
- Who is this?
- 'Effy says hi.'

291
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,196
What? Put Effy on the phone!

292
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,077
Hello?

293
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,957
Fuck! Come on, Sid.

294
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,749
Looks a bit... spooky.

295
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,637
You're not still afraid of the dark?

296
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,472
You still sleep with that
night light on, don't you?

297
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,599
It's not a night light.
It's a glow-in-the-dark Batman. It's retro.

298
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,877
Effy!

299
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,713
Effy! Effy! Effy!

300
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,155
Effy! Eff... y!

301
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,950
No, I don't think she's here.

302
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,793
- Doesn't look like much of a party, does it?
- No.

303
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,037
Effy! Effy!

304
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,479
Only if you want some.

305
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,868
Course she fucking wants it.

306
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,234
There we go.

307
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,357
Dr Stock's marvellous medicine.

308
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,157
Sometimes I think I was born backwards,
you know?

309
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,276
Come out of my mum the wrong way.

310
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,353
I hear words go past me backwards.

311
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,079
The people I should love I hate.

312
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,390
And the people I hate...

313
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,759
Ow! Fuck!

314
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,277
All the help I've ever given you,
and you've been fucking useless tonight.

315
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,554
I've been good.

316
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,710
You've been useless.
You're always fucking useless.

317
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,997
Take Michelle.
I worked fucking hard to create

318
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,674
a shagging opportunity for you.
Then you went pussy.

319
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,715
No...

320
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,438
Instead, she ends up with this Josh,

321
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,479
a complete fucking knob,
who I have to sort, so that's your fault, too.

322
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,199
Sort? What did you do?

323
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,317
Put naked pictures
of Abigail on his phone.

324
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,756
Made sure Michelle could see them.
Made sure everyone could see them.

325
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,512
It was quite funny.

326
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,194
Funny? That's sick.

327
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,633
His sister. Why did you do that?

328
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,355
You know what, Tony?

329
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,318
Sometimes I don't know
why we're friends any more.

330
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,992
It's weird, isn't it?

331
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,957
I'm from Mars, you're from Venus.

332
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,349
I do things, you worry about them.

333
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,750
I sleep with girls,
you persuade them to attempt suicide.

334
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,398
Don't.

335
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,636
Are you bunching your fists at me, Sid?

336
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,996
If you wanna hit me, go right ahead.

337
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,033
Ow!

338
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,757
I said a punch, not a bitch slap!

339
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,399
I can't believe you slapped me!
That's hilarious!

340
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,474
Sid, you'd better not be crying.

341
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,391
I'm not crying cos you punched me.

342
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,994
You're crying for the kids in Africa?

343
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,469
You know I used to so
look up to you, don't you?

344
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,675
Of course I did!

345
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,433
You were at home every night
wanking your brains out.

346
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,192
"Someday I'll be like Tony.

347
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,077
"Someday I'll be like Tony."

348
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,391
And now I can think of nothing worse
than being you!

349
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,559
You've always been selfish,
I always understood that.

350
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,758
You did things because you wanted
something - fine. Makes sense.

351
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,512
But now,

352
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,273
now you do things because you can!

353
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,749
You fuck with people...

354
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,674
...and I don't get why.

355
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,154
You've got no friends, no girlfriend,
only your parents <i>left.</i>

356
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,994
Not even Effy is answering your calls.

357
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,593
You're right,

358
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,238
she is clever.

359
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,636
Every time you talk, Sid,

360
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,235
little flecks of spit
are coming out of your mouth

361
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,151
and they're going on my face.

362
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,152
Sid? Sid! Don't be a little girl.

363
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,434
What? Ef?

Sid. Sid! How the hell
am I going to get out of here?

367
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,631

I'm grateful that you did.

380
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,918
- 'OK.'
- OK.

381
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,080
'So how come you called me?'

382
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,276
I dunno.

383
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,757
I'll tell you why you rang.

384
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,876
It's because you miss me.

385
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,793
It's because I'm the only person
you can really talk to.

386
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,396
Yeah, Michelle.
That's right, this is all about you.

387
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,277
'Well, isn't it?'

388
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,635
Not tonight. No.

389
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,636
Are you OK, Tony?

390
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,435
No.

391
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,919
What's the matter?

392
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,197
'Effy's missing. Sid's meant to help me
find her but he's fucked off.

'and I don't know what to do.'

395
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,520
This is the weirdest
fucking night of my life.

396
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,591
What do you want me to do, Tony?

397
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,478
'Nothing.

398
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,993
'I gotta go.'

You know it's, like,
two in the morning, don't you?

400
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,995
You're the one that's been
following me round all night.

401
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,474
You've got a black eye growing,
did you know that?

402
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,758
- Tony punched me.
- Wow! Really? That's excellent.

403
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,193
Is it?

404
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,352
We did a course on it at the centre -
separation anxiety.

405
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,714
He's worried he's losing you.

406
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,313
Well, I just did leave him.

407
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,834
I mean, literally. And then I...

408
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,873
I wanted to see you.

409
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,239
Do you want to kiss me, Sid?

410
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,998
OK. So this is where you lean in.

411
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,517
Cool.

412
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,192
Yeah.

413
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,556
I'm sorry, I'm usually better than that. It's...

414
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,789
No, it was lovely.

415
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,395
No, my rhythm was out and my teeth,
they kept getting in the way.

416
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,550
Could I... try again?

417
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,191

Um, kind of weirdly, Michelle.

421
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,670
Answer it.

422
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,473
Sid? I'm worried about Tony.

'Tony? Don't worry about him.'

424
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,590
I just spoke to him.
He sounded strange, in a real mess.

425
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,830
Michelle, can I ring you back?

426
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,469
He's at some Ston Eaton sports place.

00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,994
- Where?
- 'Ston Eaton. Something weird's going on.'

OK. I'm leaving now.

00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,073
It's Tony. He's in trouble.

Tony.

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,596
- Oh.
- I'm really sorry. I've got to go.

Wahey!

- Raise or fold, man.

- Don't waste my time.
- I'll see you.

Effy, Effy. What happened?!

453
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,590
Effy, Effy. What happened?

454
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,150
Someone call an ambulance. Effy.
Oh, fuck!

no, not a joke. More a funny fact.

Don't worry, it's not her first time.

00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,356
You won't be taking her virginity.
Right, Spence?

She's my sister, you sick fuck!

I want you to fuck her.

No, you can't mean that!

481
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,473
- Do you want me to play with it a bit?
- I can't.

482
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,118
- Help you out?
- I really can't.

483
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,474
Then you're a shit brother.

484
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,790
- She's dying over there, Tony!
- I promise...

485
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,518
You'd better get hard!

486
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,989
Please... Please...

487
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,354
Beg me.

488
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,911
I beg you.
I beg you, I beg you...

Please...

490
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,191
(Josh) Well, you only needed to ask.
Here endeth the lesson.

491

(Sid) Tony? What's happened?

492
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,796
What the fuck's happened to her?

493
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,313
It's all my fault.

494
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,713

00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,155
Oh. It's all looking fine.
It's good, yes. I'd go as far as great.

518
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,755
These kids are remarkably
resilient creatures, you know?

519
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,913
It's all gone, and whatever hasn't
will be out in a few days.

520
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,673
One way or the other.

521
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,276
She took some very clean,
pure pharmaceuticals.

522
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,598
Right, OK. I'll leave you be.

523
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,951
So I suppose we should congratulate you
for getting her clean drugs.

524
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,793
You think this was me?

525
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,757
She was with you!

526
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,831
I wasn't, I was...

527
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,148
Don't deny it!

528
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,073
Tony, she's your little sister!

529
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,832
I know.

530
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,148
I know.

531
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,117
But, listen... for a second...

532
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,398
No. I've had enough of listening to you.
We all have!

533
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,508
You and your horrid little ways,
always at other people's expense.

534
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,036
Hang on. That's enough.

535
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,792
What?

536
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,348
He loves Effy.

537
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,032
Don't you think this is hard enough?

538
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,917
And who the fuck are you?

539
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,150
I'm his best friend!

540
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,071
And I'm his fucking father!

541
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,878
I know what you are.

542
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,670
Come on, Tony. We're going.

543
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,273
I wanna stay with Effy.

544
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,793
Come on, mate.

545
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,672
Ah! Fuck!

546
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,352
Thank you, Sid.

547
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,557
It's OK. They're free.

548
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,996
No, I mean really, thank you.

549
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,638
Yeah, I know what you mean, Tony.

550
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,909
- She's gonna be OK.
- Yeah.

551
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,115
I'm sorry.

552
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,633
OK.

553
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,113
Thing is...

554
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,395
I know I can be a wanker sometimes...

555
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,678
but everyone likes that, don't they?

556
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,958
Ball-busting,
turning heads wherever I go.

557
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,358
People like that.

558
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,911
- And I like people liking that.
- We don't have to do this now.

559
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,833
But then...

560
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,754
I start to feel... distorted because...

561
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,398
...because I'm more than that.

562
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,232
I don't wanna be a wanker.

563
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,993
I don't, Sid.

564
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,674
Effy knows that.

565
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,671
She loves me for who I really am.

566
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,992
God, I sound like fucking Lionel Richie.

567
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,639
I quite like Lionel Richie.

568
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,151
All I know is,

569
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,549
when I was scared tonight,

570
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,189
and I was a bit... a lot...

571
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,713
I wanted you there.

572
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,990
Effy's different. I sort of own her
cos she's my sister, but with you...

573
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,791
I just really wanted you there.

574
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,431
And then you were in the car.

575
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,036
The thing is, Tony,

576
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,758
you sort of own me, too.

577
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,958
Mostly in a good way.

578
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,233
Come on,
I'm taking you for breakfast.

579
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,513
You do know it's 4 a.m., don't you?

580
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,750
Yeah, I know.

581
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,991
Do you reckon we'll find us
anywhere that'll do us a curry?

582
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,036
I've got a real craving for curry.
