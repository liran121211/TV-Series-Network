1
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,029
- Yes, Cocker, that's mine. My turn.
- Chelle, hi. You ok?

2
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,633
You dirty fucker! I never want to
see your tiny, twatty cock ever again.

3
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,039
What's up, Nips?

4
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,871
Hey, hey, come on, Chelle.

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,312
I was waiting for you tell
me. Time's up, you wanker!

6
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,630
Jesus, what have you done this time?

7
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,711
- Sid?
- I dunno.

8
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,391
Oh, Christ's sake!

9
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,950
I must say, she is a fiery one.

10
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,997
Tone, shouldn't you,
you know, go after her?

11
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,311
She'll come back.

12
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,198
Michelle! Chelle, what happened?

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,349
Never mind!

14
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,112
"Never mind"?

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,191
Did he screw someone again?

16
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,473
Again?

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,917
I tried to tell you, Chelle.

18
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,794
About who?

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,919
- But you never wanna hear it.
- About who, for Christ's sakes?!

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,878
Jenny, Maggs, Kelly, White
Justine, Black Justine,

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,635
buck teeth from the geography
trip, posh kid from the choir...

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,472
Abigail?

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,596
Abigail Stock?

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,513
He promised he hadn't.
Why didn't you tell me?

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,477
You're supposed to be my friend.

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,269
Chelle, I tried. I didn't wanna...

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,998
It's just Tony, right?

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,839
Did you do him?

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,876
What? Don't be so stupid, Michelle.

30
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,713
I bet you wanted to fuck him.

31
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,119
Cheers, Jal. That's what
friends are for, yeah

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,633
Whatever, Chelle.

33
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,879
Chelle?

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,593
Go away.

35
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,154
Please don't tell anyone.
Everyone will think...

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,992
Think what, Max?

37
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,596
That you're a dirty little slut who fucks
around with other people's boyfriends?

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,878
I'm sorry. I don't know what
happened. He just... It was nothing.

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,997
Can't we just pretend
it didn't happen? Yeah?

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,877
Go away.

41
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,119
Hi.

42
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,350
You mustn't call me, ok?

43
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,990
Yes, that was lovely,

44
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,638
but we just can't.

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,673
You want to what?

46
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,119
Oh...

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,838
Oh, God.

48
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,879
You're not even going to see
that again, never mind lick it!

49
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,315
Now listen to me, ok? It's over.

50
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,674
Over and...

51
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,553
Oh, Christ!

52
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,195
Drink?

53
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,759
No! God, Michelle.

54
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,796
Who were you talking to?

55
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,871
Nobody.

56
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,639
I'm gonna be sick.

57
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,676
Oh, um...

58
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,434
- I feel better.
- Good.

59
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,271
You going to tell me what's happened?

60
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,793
Possibly Tony?

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,752
Listen, I'm sure you can work it out.

62
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,477
Oh, God, I love him so much!

63
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,356
And I made him go away.

64
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,278
Look... he's so lovely.

65
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,231
Speak to him. Always best to talk.

66
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,151
Yeah?

67
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,153
Yeah. Communication, that's the key.

68
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,311
Fuck off, you wanker!

69
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,550
No, you listen to me, tosser!

70
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,200
Leave me alone. Leave me alone!

71
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,352
For the last time,
fucking leave me alone!

72
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,836
Shall I, er... drive you home?

73
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,559
Thanks.

74
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,193
I know who that was.

75
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,428
Who?

76
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,953
On the phone.

77
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,792
It was Chris, wasn't it?

78
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,359
Of course not.

79
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,192
Why on Earth would Chris ring me?

80
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,236
Angie. Angie!

81
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,835
Look, I know you're here.
Your car's in the car park.

82
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,797
You want me, Angie!

83
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,151
Oh, fuck!

84
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,590
I don't see why you
couldn't catch the bus home.

85
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,912
Cash outage. It's not my fault the
student residences are five miles away.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,992
- Anyway, I wanted to see you and...
- Shut up, Chris, ok?!

87
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,596
Michelle doesn't mind. She's got
her own problems, ain't you, Chelle?

88
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,477
Shut up, Chris. Ok?

89
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,993
OK.

90
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,913
Cheers, Angie. I'm really grateful...
for the hockey kit and everything.

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,479
So am I.

92
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,993
Shut it!

93
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,953
Yours?

94
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,478
It's all right, you know.

95
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,357
It's not all right.

96
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,795
- I know you want me.
- I don't want you.

97
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,393
It makes perfect sense.

98
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,709
None of this makes sense. I'm your
fucking psychology teacher, ok?

99
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,268
It was a mistake and
I'm not doing it again!

100
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,672
Chelle. Chelle!

101
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,988
Hey, Nips!

102
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,113
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!

103
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,760
Arise, fair sun, and
kill the envious moon,

104
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,229
Who is already sick and pale with grief.

105
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,437
Why don't you just leave
her alone for a bit?

106
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,794
Sidney?

107
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,474
- She thinks you're a tit.
- She doesn't think I'm a tit.

108
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,391
Why do you pull all this shit, Tone?

109
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,311
Look around, Sidney.

110
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,995
Fuck all ever happens in this shitty
little town. You gotta improvise.

111
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,436
- No matter who you hurt?
- So I messed around with Maxxie a bit.

112
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,750
So what? He was bored, I was bored,

113
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,876
Michelle was bored, and now we're not.

114
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,474
And she's gonna feel so
good when she gets me back.

115
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,915
- You sure?
- Don't be such a dildo, Sid.

116
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,558
Course she will.

117
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,234
It is my lady! O, it is my love!

118
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,518
O, that she knew she were! She
speaks, yet she says nothing.

119
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,752
What of that? Her eye
discourses, I will answer it.

120
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,874
Sid?

121
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,636
You see, Sidney? Now you're getting it!

122
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,233
Now you're getting it!

123
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,634
SLURPS

124
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,275
What?

125
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,796
Babe, she's doing it again.

126
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,156
Michelle, don't look at Malcolm
in a funny way when he's eating.

127
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,630
- Does he have to make that noise?
- I'm only eating, for Christ's sakes!

128
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,472
He's only eating.

129
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,075
Babe, I got that delivery coming
today. You said you'd lend me the dosh.

130
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,559
Oh, yeah.

131
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,269
- Er, why are you giving him money?
- Sweetheart, we're married.

132
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,352
We all want Malcolm's new
venture to be a success, don't we?

133
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,829
Cheers, babe.

134
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,271
Why are you being so horrible?

135
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,271
- Why do you care?
- I do care,

136
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,750
but in an "I'm already late for work"
kind of way. So come on, make it snappy.

137
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,274
- I dumped Tony.
- Oh, right. What for?

138
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,670
He went down on a boy in my
history class while I was watching.

139
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,714
Right. Well, you know, say you're
sorry or something. I don't know.

140
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,554
And try and be nice to Malcolm.
Anyway, what are you doing today?

141
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,598
I thought I'd lounge around
the house in my underwear.

142
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,272
Great, ok.

143
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,238
Look, please be nice to Malcolm.

144
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,390
I love him. He's my husband.

145
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,596
Try and be happy for me.

146
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,717
Jesus!

147
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,791
A psychology teacher can do that?

148
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,997
Yes, she can. But look, we
gotta keep it under wraps, yeah?

149
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,718
Hmm. Yeah.

150
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,074
She got you good, Tone.

151
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,230
That wasn't Michelle. This was.

152
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,636
Hey, Nips.

153
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,998
People have got issues.

154
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,595
If anyone else wants to take a
pop, then, please, go for it now.

155
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,359
Better out than in.

156
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,000
Sidney, are you gonna
tell me what's going on?

157
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,752
It's like a fucking episode of The OC.

158
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,831
Nothing. Just leave it, ok?

159
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,990
Right, everyone. Um...

160
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,150
You ok, Angie?

161
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,435
Yeah.

162
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,475
Um...

163
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,313
Why are you wearing that scarf thing?

164
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,152
It's a bit draughty today.

165
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,872
It doesn't suit you, Ange.

166
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,076
Anyway, who's presenting?

167
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,718
It's me.

168
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,711
Ok, well, get on with it.

169
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,476
- "The role of sex in power relationships."
- I asked you to write that?

170
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,554
Yeah.

171
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,314
"Power is the single most
important force in the universe.

172
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,996
"Money and looks mean nothing
except for the power they give us.

173
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,598
"The second most important is
sex. So sex plus power equals fun."

174
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,590
Whatever you did that Michelle's
too upset to talk about,

175
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,875
I hope you're ashamed of yourself.

176
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,638
It was all my fault.

177
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,788
I got off with Tony on the Russia trip.

178
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,072
I only did it because I fell out
with Anwar when he said he hated gays,

179
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,790
so I got upset, and Tony said he'd
give me head, to cheer me up, you know,

180
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,633
and I didn't mean
anything, but I lost my head

181
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,429
and then he gave me head, and
then we got deported from Russia.

182
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,717
And I'm really, really
sorry for being a slut, ok?

183
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,395
Right, well...

184
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,278
Anyone else wanna get
something off their chest?

185
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,229
- I'm in love with...
- Sit down!

186
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,314
Hi, Abi.

187
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,318
Michelle. How, uh, safe to see you.

188
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,958
Isn't it?

189
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,270
- Can I ask you something?
- Yah?

190
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,875
Ok. I was just wondering how many
times you fucked my boyfriend.

191
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,030
Oh, Abi, you didn't!

192
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,839
Very, very rude of you,
yah? It's just horrid!

193
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,592
Don't worry, he fucks everyone...

194
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,910
including boys, so
you've got that in common.

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,992
- Oh, you absolute bitch!
- Hey, hey, hey! Easy, Abi, easy.

196
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,117
God, I didn't! I mean, I just wouldn't.

197
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,394
That's terrible.

198
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,995
I wouldn't go there, mate.
Don't know what she's picked up.

199
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,594
- Know what I mean?
- It's the absolute limit!

200
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,515
Let go of me! I want to shit
her, the fucking bitch-cow-whore!

201
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,434
Perhaps you should go. I'm Josh,
by the way, Abigail's brother.

202
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,078
Sweet.

203
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,230
Ok, well, bye, girls.

204
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,118
Bye, Abi. Three little
maids from school are we...

205
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,794
Let me go! I want to tear her tits off!

206
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,509
- Let go of me!
- Wow!

207
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,716
Come here, you curly-haired tart!

208
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,233
I'm gonna fuck you up!

209
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,920
Come back! Come back!

210
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,198
* So say good night

211
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,149
* To the fallen truth

212
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:18,157
* Say good night to the
anger that swells inside you

213
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,152
* Say good night to the stars

214
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,119
* That are following you

215
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,670
* And say good night to the moon.

216
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,834
How long are you gonna keep this up for?

217
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,110
You know what? I never realised how
fucking knackering it is to know you, Tone.

218
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,714
- It's fun, though.
- You think?

219
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,278
Anyway, what do you want?

220
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,510
You know what? Tell me you love me.

221
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,631
You know I love you, Nips.

222
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,439
No! Tell me like you'd die for me,

223
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,638
like nothing else matters, like your
world stops turning because of me.

224
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,110
Like you mean it, you
little shit. Go on.

225
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,997
I mean, come on.

226
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,233
Wrong answer, Tony.

227
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,833
Fuck off. I'm busy.

228
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,839
* In my head it was cloudy all over

229
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,595
* In my eye I could picture this guy

230
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,753
* With a tear tattoo under one eye...

231
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,992
'Hi, this is Cass. Don't bother leaving
a message because I'm not listening.'

232
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,229
BEEP

233
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,959
* With a bag that I'm
sure that he never put down

234
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,399
* He would sit...

235
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,879
Hi.

236
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,679
Hi.

237
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,193
You love me, right?

238
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,077
You really love me.

239
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,912
Yeah...

240
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,797
How much?

241
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,674
A lot.

242
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,752
- That'll do.
- Wait. What are we?

243
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,512
It's now, Sid.

244
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,033
It's now, ok?

245
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,955
- You go.
- No, you.

246
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,074
- You.
- Why not you?

247
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,033
Michelle...

248
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,394
Michelle... ly glasses.

249
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,232
Um...

250
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,754
are we gonna practise safe sex?

251
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,877
All in good time.

252
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,111
Stand by for lift
- off.

253
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,915
Sid?

254
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,515
I think I can honestly say that
that has never happened before.

255
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,953
Bugger.

256
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,035
Come on, grab my tits.

257
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,599
Grab them!

258
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,553
Yeah?

259
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,595
I dunno, Chelle.

260
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,318
- I'll take it off.
- Michelle...

261
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,992
It's got a funny clip.

262
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,991
Chelle!

263
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,392
I've dreamt of this twice a night for
the past eight years, to be exact...

264
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,874
and three times on birthdays.

265
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,678
Wow!

266
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,079
Was I good?

267
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,993
Oh, yeah, yeah. But this
feels funny, you know?

268
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,638
My tits feel funny?

269
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,712
No! No. You've got a lovely handful.

270
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,316
But the thing is, you're Michelle.

271
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,517
My friend Michelle.

272
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,794
Do you fancy someone else?

273
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,273
I think I do.

274
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,558
But we're ok, yeah?

275
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,996
Because this isn't right when
you're missing someone too.

276
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,272
Sid, have you got a
razor I could borrow?

277
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,112
It's ok, Dad. Michelle's
just a bit upset.

278
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,270
Liz? ...Yeah.

279
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,954
Hey, listen. It's
conclusive! He's not gay!

280
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,839
Should have rung, but she
doesn't answer. Let's go.

281
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,434
Just because you made
someone try to kill herself

282
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,033
doesn't mean she won't
be glad to see you.

283
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,553
You reckon?

284
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,919
- That's it, we're going.
- For Christ's sake! Come on.

285
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,993
Wow!

286
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,835
Jesus. What are they all doing?

287
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,435
They're trying to be
happy, Sid. It isn't easy.

288
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,795
No.

289
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,596
Can you see her?

290
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,113
Let's mingle.

291
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,111
Just be inconspicuous.

292
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,673
Whoa!

293
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,555
Cass...

294
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,515
Oh, wow. Hi. What a lovely surprise.

295
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,591
Hey, Cass.

296
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,079
How are you doing?

297
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,709
I'm so cool. But we're not supposed
to have visitors during happy time.

298
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,633
We won't be long. Sid
wants to say something.

299
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,278
Lovely.

300
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,793
I'll leave you to it, ok?

301
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,512
You want to stroke my pussy?

302
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,318
Um...

303
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,278
Isn't he lovely?

304
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,273
There were four, but they won't
let Gerard look after them any more.

305
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,279
Um, Cass...

306
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,511
I'm sorry you tried to
kill yourself because of me.

307
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,512
Oh, that's ok, Sid.

308
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,797
I realised something.
I've been an idiot.

309
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,996
Yes.

310
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,073
And I was hoping maybe
you'd give me another chance?

311
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,676
Oh, wow, Sid!

312
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,718
Cool. You're so lovely. Wow!

313
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,074
Great.

314
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,596
- If I wasn't seeing Simon, that'd be amazing.
- Simon?

315
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,795
That's me.

316
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,873
- We've got so much in common.
- Depression, self-Ioathing.

317
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,713
He knows we can't have a physical
thing, I don't do that now.

318
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,792
- I'm still hoping you'll change your mind.
- I won't. So you see, it's all so exciting.

319
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,598
- Right.
- He wants me.

320
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,193
- I do.
- And he can never have me.

321
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,352
- I'm hopeful.
- It's just perfect. Isn't it?

322
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,152
I could get to like this.

323
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,472
I find it rather cool for
Kenya this time of year.

324
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,676
Ok.

325
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,354
Ok, Marjorie, ready?

326
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,750
Quite. Now, did you have a
word with the Prince of Wales?

327
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,308
He simply must stop
coming in to my room.

328
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,269
He's a frightful cad and, well, I
mean, I'm old enough to be his mother.

329
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,759
Ha.

330
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,158
Hi.

331
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,798
Um, what are you doing here?

332
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,190
Er, visiting. What are you doing?

333
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,635
Working for my mum. She
kind of owns the place.

334
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,188
I think you might be breaking the rules.

335
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,919
Oh, leave the girl alone.
She's tremendous thighs

336
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,070
and deserves a little respect.

337
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,794
You're right, Marjorie. Take your time.

338
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,711
Thank you.

339
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,439
Listen...

340
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,830
Do you fancy a coffee maybe? Tomorrow?

341
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,036
Yeah. Nice.

342
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,157
Mud Dock, then. Tomorrow, about midday?

343
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,673
Ok.

344
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,354
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

345
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,796
Would you have a word
with the quartermaster?

346
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,714
I like my antelope
preferably fairly well cooked.

347
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,950
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

348
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,195
Hello?

349
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,832
What the fuck?

350
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,315
They've sent me too many
fucking Bongo Dongo Dogs.

351
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,709
You know Mum meets
clients here on a Tuesday?

352
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,519
So? And I've only got
two Gerry Giraffes.

353
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,875
Why are you such a wanker, Malcolm?

354
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,029
Eh?

355
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,078
I know you're using her. Spending
her money on your fuck-ups.

356
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,549
I can only assume
you've got a huge cock,

357
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,870
because there's no other reason she'd
waste her time on a tit like you.

358
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,115
Hi, I'm back...

359
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,952
What the fuck?

360
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,513
Um, what the fuck are these?

361
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,036
That's Bongo Dongo Dog,
and this is Gerry Giraffe.

362
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,554
Hey, babe.

363
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,108
I have got clients coming
round in eight minutes

364
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,318
to buy into my unique vision of
modern furnishings and fabrics.

365
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,312
I thought that we could
put a few of them about

366
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,436
and maybe your clients could buy 'em.

367
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,433
You think my clients would
decorate their homes with these?

368
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,433
Sure they would, babe. Look at
the little expression on his face.

369
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,078
Ah, love it. Ain't they lovely?

370
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,516
- Get these fucking fucking fuckers...
- They're 17.99 each...

371
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,114
out of my fucking house!

372
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,148
You bitch. You keep
your hands off my stuff.

373
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,595
Tosser. Keep your crap out of my house!

374
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,309
There's nowhere else to put it. And
keep your stupid daughter out of my face.

375
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,960
- They were so right about you.
- Oh, yeah? About what?

376
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,918
- You're a useless, lazy tosser.
- Fat old slapper.

377
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,955
Fuck you!

378
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,749
Fuck you right back, right
up your big, fat, lardy arse!

379
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,637
Goodbye, Malcolm.

380
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,748
Malcolm says you were rude to him.
You'll go and say you're sorry.

381
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,789
- No!
- Go and say you're sorry to my husband!

382
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,510
Right. Go on, then.

383
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,794
I'm sorry.

384
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,633
I should never have
said you have a big cock.

385
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,154
I now realise I was mistaken.

386
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,518
That's not how it sounds, babe.

387
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,431
I know. Because you do, don't you?

388
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,192
What?

389
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,316
Have an unfeasibly large cock.

390
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,396
Yep.

391
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,950
Well, get it out, Bongo Dongo
Boy, cos I'm ready to make up.

392
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,189
She does my head in. He's my
third stepdad in seven years.

393
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,748
Twenty-fucking-seven
years old.

394
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,310
Jesus, I mean, that's disgusting,
right? That's, that's...

395
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,516
I dunno. It's better she's
got someone, isn't it?

396
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,589
You think?

397
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,069
God, yeah. Mother hasn't
been laid in ten years.

398
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,991
Probably why she's off her trolley.

399
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,069
She's what?

400
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,276
She's completely nuts.

401
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,839
Psychotic basket case.

402
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,436
- And she's a...
- Child psychiatrist.

403
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,635
- It's nice.
- What?

404
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,199
Having someone to talk to.

405
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,559
- My last boyfriend never really spoke to me.
- How's that?

406
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,437
It's hard to explain.

407
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,911
Everything Tony says, you can't work out
whether it's a joke or an insult or...

408
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,275
I dunno.

409
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,635
Sounds like he wore you out.

410
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,149
Yeah.

411
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,629
You really know how to
get me talking, don't you?

412
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,712
Son of a psychiatrist.
Get it every sodding day.

413
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,119
Your mother analyses you?

414
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,633
And the rest.

415
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,716
I'm unstable with neurotic
obsessive tendencies. I take them.

416
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,997
It keeps her happy, and
keeps me happy too, actually.

417
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,069
God. You're very upfront.

418
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,832
What other way is there to be?

419
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,229
Josh... do you wanna get out of here?

420
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,554
Where to?

421
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,200
A few drinks... I dunno.

422
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,275
Let's go.

423
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,118
Fuck the drinks. Let's go to my place.

424
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,274
* One is a gun with a
dart for my sweetheart

425
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,798
* Two, only you

426
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,314
* Can remove such an ache, so

427
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,435
* Three

428
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,514
* Let me see what you've got * What
you're made of, what you're not...

429
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,672
Hi, Tony. You're looking so, so fit.

430
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,637
Fit as fuck, yah? Yah?

431
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,438
Hi, Abi.

432
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,513
I heard you dumped that chav
girl. That's so safe. Slut.

433
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,151
We just weren't on the
same level intellectually.

434
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,639
Not like you and me, eh, Abi?

435
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,994
I am rather brainy.

436
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,274
Yes.

437
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,557
Which was why I was thinking you
might be just the right person

438
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,631
to help with my photographic project.

439
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,199
It's a study of the human form.

440
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,032
In-depth, focus study.

441
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,839
Well, that sounds
jolly interesting, Tony.

442
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,717
When were you thinking of starting?

443
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,836
Because I'm completely free right now.

444
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,359
Cool. My place?

445
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,839
Safe.

446
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,838
You're lovely.

447
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,319
Am I?

448
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,197
Yeah.

449
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,032
You're clever,

450
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,270
funny, and...

451
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,793
very, very pretty.

452
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,113
Do you think one of my tits
is bigger than the other?

453
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,872
What?

454
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,393
Is one...

455
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,834
Never mind.

456
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,793
Never mind.

457
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,116
You really have to take those things?

458
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,031
Yeah, afraid so. Done it for so long.

459
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,395
Mother used to serve
them up with breakfast.

460
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,152
I get a bit wobbly otherwise.

461
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,071
I can't believe that.

462
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,151
You should try without.

463
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,639
No.

464
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,280
Um, you wouldn't like me so much.

465
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,839
I think I would.

466
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,874
Who's that?

467
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,439
I thought everybody was out.

468
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,831
Cheers, mate.

469
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,672
I'll get the rest.

470
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,475
Malcolm?

471
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,355
I thought you was at college today.

472
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,718
You know, of all my mum's marriages,
I think this has been the shortest.

473
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,635
I don't have to explain this to you.

474
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,597
No, you don't.

475
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,432
Tell her I'm sorry.

476
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,632
I just couldn't hack it, you know?

477
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,472
Yeah, I know.

478
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,473
Something to remember me by.

479
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,150
Careless.

480
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,593
Goodbye, Malcolm.

481
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,793
Bye.

482
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,872
Six little stitches
thread through my heart

483
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:00,437
Seven shiny reasons tearing us apart

484
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,313
Eight, loose your hate

485
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,075
* It's a game * Come on,
love me, it's your fate

486
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,671
* Nah nah-nah-nah
nah nah nah * Dart

487
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,035
* Nah nah-nah-nah
nah nah nah * For

488
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,634
* Nah nah-nah-nah
nah nah nah * My

489
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,076
* Nah nah-nah-nah nah
nah nah * Sweetheart

490
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,593
* Nah nah-nah-nah nah
nah nah, sweetheart

491
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,595
* Dart for my sweetheart...

492
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,951
- Sorry, mate.
- That's all right.

493
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,990
- Quite a nice phone, mate.
- Cheers, Jonno.

494
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,274
Yeah. Later, Tone.

495
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,038
You're such a gentleman.

496
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,675
I'll ring you.

497
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,194
Maybe just whistle.

498
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,429
What?

499
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,796
You know how to
whistle, don't you, Josh?

500
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,552
You put your lips together and...

501
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,037
I'll whistle.

502
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,673
Here's a tenner. Get
her home safe, yeah?

503
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,275
Stay not, be gone.

504
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,875
Live, and hereafter say,

505
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,633
"A madman's mercy bade thee run away."

506
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,030
What? Who?

507
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,477
'Josh. He sent me pictures of Abigail.

508
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,950
'She's... she's got
her tits out for him!

509
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,678
'Why did he do that? '

510
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,714
Who's? Who's Josh?

511
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,392
Chelle!

512
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,392
'Oh, God! He warned me.

513
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,675
'He's fucking crazy.

514
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,354
'I feel so weird! '

515
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,715
Ah, babes.

516
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,030
You'll be ok.

517
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,512
I'm fine. I'm fine...

518
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,556
I fucked it all up again!

519
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,079
I'm too loud. Too impatient. Too clever.

520
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,789
You know, what I always forget
is, because I'm happy, you know,

521
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,793
because I'm just being me, I can't
help it if I'm a funny old cow

522
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,838
with a loud mouth and a big bum!

523
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,831
Your bum's not that big.

524
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,069
You know, I never felt tired around him.

525
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,996
I felt good, really good, and
now he's gone, the fucking twat!

526
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,959
And I know he loves me,
he's just a scaredy cat.

527
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,833
I'm sorry, Mum.

528
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,233
You know, I really, really
loved having sex with him!

529
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,755
Hi.

530
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,035
Hi.

531
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,309
I'm so sorry, Chelle.

532
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,634
Come on. Let me see.

533
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,433
Jesus, I didn't know you could
get your legs into that position!

534
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,638
He warned me. He told me
his family were screwy.

535
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,472
Told me he was, too.

536
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,111
Well, that's pretty screwy! Taking
beaver shots of your own sister?!

537
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,440
Delete them.

538
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,476
Has he tried to ring you?

539
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,516
About a thousand times.

540
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,828
Don't.

541
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,354
Don't worry.

542
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,873
Drink?

543
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,115
Yeah.

544
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,713
Malcolm.

545
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,114
How are you doing?

546
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,111
Not so clever, as it goes.

547
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,111
Why's that, then, wanker?

548
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,230
I just...

549
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,880
miss the big mouth and the big bum.

550
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,635
She's my mum, Malcolm. Watch your lip!

551
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,872
I always blow it, all right?

552
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,038
I get jumpy.

553
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,148
I just... I wish I could,
like, fucking just...

554
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,593
I'm a wanker.

555
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,115
I'm a wanker.

556
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,918
Does she miss me?

557
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,113
No.

558
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,830
All right. She fucking misses you.

559
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,310
But you let her down, Malcolm,
that can't happen again.

560
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,914
So decide.

561
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,434
Stay here or get your coat.

562
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,875
Don't you fucking dare go back on it!

563
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,916
Let's go.

564
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,592
I'm staying out here.

565
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,113
Spruce up, man!

566
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,199
Ok?

567
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,033
- Ok.
- Ok.

568
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,113
You're a proper girl, yeah?

569
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,952
Yeah.

570
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,513
Hello, Nips.

571
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,678
I heard about Pervy Boy.

572
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,230
He really needs to learn how
to use a phone. "Send To AIl".

573
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,514
You gotta be careful with that.

574
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,715
Yeah. You're probably right, Tone.

575
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,232
- So...
- So?

576
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,554
Can we stop this now?

577
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,393
- And?
- Get back to normal.

578
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,870
Stuff happens. You get over it.

579
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,234
- Yeah, but...
- Yeah, but.

580
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,072
Yeah, but.

581
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,879
- Chelle, you got nasty.
- Yeah.

582
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,350
What are you doing here?

583
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,434
I came because it turns
out that, as it goes...

584
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,432
I think I might love you.

585
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,912
That's an awfully long sentence, Tony.

586
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,433
Well, yeah, but...

587
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,278
Yeah.

588
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,111
Chelle!

589
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,913
I said it, ok?

590
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,669
I'm sorry.

591
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,109
I'm sorry.

592
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,994
Beg.

593
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,671
Sorry?

594
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,478
You heard me, Tone.

595
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,992
Ok.

596
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,310
Look, please can we get back?

597
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,915
I won't do any of it again.
The cheating and lying...

598
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,390
Undermining. Sneering.
Taunting. Manipulating.

599
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,513
Ok. Yeah. All of those things.

600
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,838
I promise.

601
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,477
So?

602
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,673
So I'll see you around.
