1
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,716
Ladies and gentlemen, the seatbelt
light has been switched off.

2
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,870
You are now free to
move around the cabin.

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,475
We've reached cruising altitude
and are flying over the French Alps.

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,636
Sorry, man.

5
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,948
It's nothing to do with you!
It's the vibrations, innit?

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,519
Mm, yeah.

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,269
Fuck off, homo.

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,512
- You gonna be this horny the whole trip?
- Just wait till we get there. Oh, man.

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,310
Those Russian peasant babes will do
anything for some Levi's and a Big Mac!

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,356
Ok, everyone. Listen up.

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,992
Right, I want you all to remember
that this is not a holiday, ok?

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,437
This is your chance to nail your
module one history coursework...

13
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,080
post-Soviet industrial Russia.

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,479
It's a chance of a lifetime, gang.

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,437
Whoopee

16
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,435
Now, this isn't just education,
yeah? It's total education.

17
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,353
Total piss up.

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,273
Uh, no, no, no, no.
There'll be no "piss up", ok?

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,557
We're gonna work hard,
understanding the culture and history

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,030
of Mokshovkov in the Mordovian
Republic of the Russian Federation.

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,510
Ok? We're gonna see
the real Russia, yeah?

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,276
The wild and desolate land that
Napoleon and Hitler failed to tame.

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,990
This is adventure, yeah? This
is living, breathing history.

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,672
Who's with me?

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,317
Thank you, sir. I was
addressing history students only.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,393
- This trip will blow their minds, and yours.
- Great.

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,552
Oi, An, An. Where'd you
hide the drugs, then?

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,349
- I thought you were bringing them.
- No. You were gonna put 'em in your turban.

29
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,159
I don't wear a turban, Chris.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,071
I thought you were
gonna get one especially!

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,232
Don't panic, boys.
We've got a back-up plan.

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,033
Urgh, not up his arse?

33
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,835
Christ.

34
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,909
Jeez.

35
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,469
Thanks.

36
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,552
What's happening?

37
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,438
They think he's a fucking terrorist?

38
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,114
- Where they gonna take me?
- Do something.

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,475
- Right, ok. Leave it to me.
- Tom, maybe I should...

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,198
No, no, no. I'm trip leader.

41
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,192
If anyone's gonna be anally
searched, it should be me.

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,396
Trip leader. Let me through.

43
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,119
Nyet!

44
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,508
Get the fuck off me!

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,275
No, sorry, sorry. Listen,
listen! That boy is in my charge

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,557
and I can give you my
personal guarantee that...

47
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,595
Ah.

48
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,240
Oh, I see. Ok.

49
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,550
No, no, no. I've given you everything.

50
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,551
Ahh! There's nothing fucking up there!

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,631
No... ok, ok, ok.

52
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,719
That's totally stereotyping. You
gonna let them get away with it?

53
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,715
Now what?

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,392
Just walk on.

55
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,711
I'm trying
- they just look so disappointed I'm not a terrorist.

56
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,270
Well, you're a very dull
Muslim, Anwar. Very dull indeed.

57
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,191
ROAR OF AIRPLANE ENGINES

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,158
Excuse me.

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,589
Uh, hello, excuse me.

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,956
Hello, hi. Uh, we're
looking for our bus.

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,478
Um, we had an arrangement, uh,
for a bus to, uh, Mokshokov.

62
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,677
- Mokshokov?
- Um... How can I put this? Um...

63
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,639
- We ordered a bus.
- Ahh!

64
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,074
Ugh. Bet you never thought you'd
be doing this last week, eh?

65
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,235
No.

66
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,870
Fucking hell. This place better be good.

67
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,033
My hair is destroyed. I need a
shower and a decent hairdryer.

68
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,396
Oh, great, Tom. We're
staying in a fucking prison.

69
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,072
Don't judge a book by its cover.

70
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,278
This trip is all about
understanding other people's culture.

71
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,509
Hello!

72
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,079
Dobry den.

73
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,832
- Ya, Tom Barkley. And you are...
- Irene Kovskaya. Translator.

74
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,514
Come! I lock you in!

75
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,036
Ok, it's two to a room.

76
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,156
So pair up, people!

77
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,233
Raas! Russia's big, bruv!
Me's gonna be hyped up.

78
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,836
No, it's same sex only, I'm afraid.
So rearrange yourselves, yep.

79
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,198
Spoilsport.

80
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,191
Come, come.

81
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,913
- And we are going to be roomies, I'm afraid.
- What?

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,118
Yeah. Budget couldn't stretch
to single lodgings so...

83
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,475
We'll make ourselves comfy, yeah?

84
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,754
Yeah?

85
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,596
I pushed and pushed but still nothing.

86
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,798
What the fuck are we gonna do
here without any drugs? Look it it.

87
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,872
Don't blame me if
I've got guts of steel.

88
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,080
Dunno why you came anyway.
You don't even do history.

89
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,355
I thought it would be uplifting.

90
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,153
Let me have a go.

91
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,794
Cheers, man.

92
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,553
Magic fingers.

93
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,112
What the fuck?

94
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,430
What?

95
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,878
"Bad mood-comfy jim jams"?

96
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,350
What? You try arguing with a
45-year-old Pakistani woman, then.

97
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,991
Did she pack you these as well?

98
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,958
No, but she packed me this.

99
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,756
Seriously impressive, man.

100
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,197
- Must have taken ages.
- You can have it, if you want.

101
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,438
Cheers.

102
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,229
Dinner.

103
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,159
Wank or tell group?

104
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,116
Wank or tell group?

105
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,873
Ah, tell group!

106
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,553
Guys, guys!

107
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,473
I've seen boobs! A girl with boobs!

108
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,028
God, that's pathetic, Anwar.

109
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,157
No. You wanna see this, though!
She's got a big chopper as well.

110
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,195
Oh, my God!

111
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,713
I wanna see that.

112
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,997
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys,
guys, what about your dinner?

113
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,719
You don't wanna look at
the girl with the boobs?

114
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,711
Nah. I prefer Welsh women.

115
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,110
She was there a second
ago. She was there.

116
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,078
She'll come back. She
was just there, I promise!

117
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,755
Tell us when the Spice
Girls turn up, too, yeah?

118
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,671
Piss off.

119
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,514
She was there. She had boobs.

120
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,192
Yeah, whatever, man.

121
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,952
What you doing?

122
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,350
Looking for your "Sexy Saturday
Night Leopard Skin Thong."

123
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,919
We're going out on the pull.

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,116
- Make sure you don't bring anyone back.
- Huh?

125
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,792
We are sharing a room Max, yeah.

126
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,996
I don't wanna have to
pretend to be asleep

127
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,197
while you're doing whatever you
do with some big Cossack guy.

128
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,714
Maybe you can tempt your
big-boobed peasant girl in here.

129
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,313
Have a bit of party, you know?

130
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,713
Seriously, I don't wanna have to be
stuck around watching you do a guy.

131
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,391
Can I bring a girl back?

132
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,953
I could, couldn't I? You're shit, Anwar!

133
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,190
Have you ever tried being with a girl?

134
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,840
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Well, have you?

135
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,989
Well, have you ever
tried being with a man?

136
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,832
No! Don't be sick.

137
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,797
You calling me sick?

138
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,075
No!

139
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,515
I dunno what I think, yeah.

140
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,794
I'm just a Muslim.

141
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,394
Gay's... just wrong.

142
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,710
Then you don't want
anything to do with me.

143
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,877
- All right, Max?
- No.

144
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,188
Why?

145
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,238
Well, Anwar's decided
to become a Muslim.

146
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,074
What, like, more Muslim
than he was already?

147
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,230
A bit more Muslim, yeah.

148
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,435
Oh.

149
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,159
So I need to sleep in here, ok?

150
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,357
Fine. Sid'll swap. You
don't mind, do you, mate?

151
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,795
No, it's cool.

152
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,996
Maybe take your bag, too?

153
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,395
Thanks.

154
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,199
What happened?

155
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,431
He's just, like, switched
about me being... You know.

156
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,635
Blond?

157
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,119
- No!
- Short?

158
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,633
Gay!

159
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,109
Shall I give you head?

160
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,236
- What?
- It'll cheer you up.

161
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,639
For fuck's sake.

162
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,950
You're supposed to be a friend,
and I've come here with a problem.

163
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,316
- You fuck!
- We're in Russia. I wanna try something new!

164
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,473
I'm not a hobby, Tony. You're
not taking up canoeing here!

165
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,913
I've been canoeing.

166
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,468
- Well, what about Michelle?
- Loves canoeing.

167
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,074
- Tony!
- Fine.

168
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,514
What you doing?

169
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,795
I'm gonna get an early
night. Coming to bed?

170
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,992
Hey, Max. Can you give me and
Tony some time alone, please?

171
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,230
No. Yeah, Sure. Sorry.

172
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,716
Don't come in, Tom.

173
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,835
It's Chris.

174
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,309
Chris.

175
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,551
I'm changing. You ok?

176
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,959
Can't sleep.

177
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,191
Well, have you got a book?

178
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,032
Why would I have a book?

179
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,111
You're a student.

180
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,112
But we don't need books for
your sort of thing, do ya?

181
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,795
Psychology. It's all
in your head, innit!

182
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,997
Let me in and I'll show
you my reverse-psychology.

183
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,479
No.

184
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,595
Fine. I'll go away then.

185
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,635
All right.

186
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,512
Very clever.

187
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,793
So what do you want?

188
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,756
Just wanted to see you.

189
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,873
Ok.

190
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,155
And, er, maybe a goodnight kiss.

191
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,869
Hope you're decent!

192
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,188
Wait a minute!

193
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,279
Ok. Come on in.

194
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,198
Tom. You're staring.

195
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,273
Was I?

196
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,998
- Tom!
- Sorry.

197
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,516
Well, I'll be over there.

198
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,795
If you need me.

199
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,155
You ok?

200
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,468
Yes, um...

201
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,714
I'm sweet as a nut.

202
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,314
I bet you are.

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,513
Tom, what are you doing?

204
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,397
Squat thrusts.

205
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,313
97,96

206
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,155
95, 94, 93, 92,

207
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,073
91, 90...

208
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,437
Oh, my God.

209
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,036
Sid! Quick!

210
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,313
Still nothing...

211
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,597
She's back! In a bra and pants!

212
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,636
What? Pretend Spice?

213
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,911
You know sometimes, people
wanna see something so badly

214
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,834
they actually start to imagine
they have seen something?

215
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,349
Wakey-wakey!

216
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,954
Hour for cleansing.

217
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,396
Girls first clean, then boys clean!

218
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,630
There is no fucking way I am doing that!

219
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,595
All right, Max? Man, Sid's
farting last night was rough.

220
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,675
Just take it back.

221
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,712
Take back what you said.

222
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,952
See you.

223
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,395
Shit!

224
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,672
It's an experience. Come on.

225
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,638
Come on.

226
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,439
Where's your shampoo?
Where's your shampoo?

227
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,230
Much water for your dirty face.

228
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,231
It doesn't bloody wash off!

229
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,312
Okey-dokey, karaoke. Folks, listen up.

230
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,311
Listen up!

231
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,833
This way, please.

232
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,149
Now, there's been a few problems.

233
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,869
But are we gonna let it get us down?

234
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,395
No. So.

235
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,233
Let the education begin.

236
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,316
Horse come in.

237
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,551
We break legs.

238
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,119
Then crush.

239
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,315
Add water.

240
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,155
Boil, then glue.

241
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,197
Raas! My Little Pony get whacked
up big-time. Na wha' I'm sayin!?

242
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,995
Tom.

243
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,675
Yeah, all right. All right. Like I said.

244
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,435
This is the real world,
yeah? Real things happen.

245
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,796
Deal with it. Come on.

246
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,630
That's absolute crap, Tom.

247
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,950
I thought on this
trip, we could explore.

248
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,917
You know...

249
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,513
Explore each other?

250
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,914
Tom...

251
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,075
Fuck off!

252
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,915
Come on. Why do you think
I brought you on this trip?

253
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,390
You're totally, totally out of order.

254
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,711
Oh, yeah, and maybe you are frigid.

255
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,074
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

256
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,513
Well, fuck you, Tom!

257
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,953
Yeah.

258
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,034
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

259
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,872
He can't talk to you like that.

260
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,997
- I'm gonna get the fucking twat.
- It's fine. It's fine!

261
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,991
What am I doing?

262
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,915
Come on... why not?

263
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,319
It won't take long.

264
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,358
- I'll be good, I promise.
- No.

265
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,716
Why? You've done everyone
else. Georgie, Chris, Sid.

266
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,630
How do you know?

267
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,757
I've seen. I heard about the
one with Kenneth and his mum.

268
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,795
Now, draw me.

269
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,598
Just stop it.

270
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,275
Stop it!

271
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,669
Come on, man, I'm inspirational.

272
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,318
Just stop it, yeah?

273
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,278
You're a fucking idiot. Look...

274
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,999
You've got a best friend who
thinks you're a perv, yeah,

275
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,196
and you drew him, but you won't do me?

276
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,510
I'll give you head... that's friendship.

277
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,995
The packet says that these tablets will
totally flush you out within 24 hours,

278
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,629
cos believe me, Sid,
we need those drugs.

279
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,870
- There's no drugs, Muslim boy!
- Cheers, Max.

280
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,555
You fucking prick. I can't believe
you're putting that Muslim bullshit on me!

281
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,517
- What?
- I'm against God?

282
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,079
You're the fucking worst Muslim!

283
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,071
- I pray five times a day.
- For what?

284
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,230
More pork chops? Fuck
it. Let's get a drink.

285
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,754
Of course Allah wants you
doing Class As from Sid's arse!

286
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,751
You're talking about my religion!

287
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,400
How was I ever friends
with a fucking hypocrite?

288
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,199
Happy fucking Ramadan.

289
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,953
It's not Ramadan!

290
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,028
Hey!

291
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,636
Whoa, easy man!

292
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,590
What fucking else?

293
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,354
My house! No break, no break!

294
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,796
I'm sorry... Sorry.

295
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,638
Ok.

296
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,233
- Neil Diamond?
- Yeah.

297
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,153
Neil Diamond!

298
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,755
Come.

299
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,672
So why are you with Tony?

300
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,435
He's exciting. And he must love me,
cos he could have anyone he wants.

301
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,910
Do you think he ever wants anyone else?

302
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,629
Maybe sometimes. He
always wants me the most.

303
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,518
I'm his girlfriend and
that's special, isn't it?

304
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,237
Yeah. I suppose. Listen, I
need to talk to you about him.

305
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,630
Look, I know I annoy you, Jal.

306
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,278
I don't mean to.

307
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,831
Can we get out of here,
please? Just you and me?

308
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,319
Sure.

309
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,759
Shit.

310
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,632
Sid. Sid!

311
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,871
Her dad's turned up and he's shouting.

312
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,518
It's like abuse, man.

313
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,239
Oh, so there's a dad now, is there?

314
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,469
Fuck.

315
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,469
- Fuck me. She's real.
- He's gonna hurt her. We've gotta help!

316
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,398
What are we gonna do?

317
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,270
- An, he's going. Her dad's going.
- Come on!

318
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,230
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. Where are you going?

319
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,912
Nowhere.

320
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,995
- You sure you're not going anywhere?
- Yep.

321
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,949
Guys?

322
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,108
- You going somewhere?
- No!

323
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,315
Bye, then.

324
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,555
Neil Diamond.

325
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,436
Sit down, sit down!

326
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,510
What is problem?

327
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,390
You won't understand. I mean,
you can't even speak English.

328
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,634
No problem!

329
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,799
Vodka!

330
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,028
Now, you tell me problem.

331
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,829
We drink and problem kaput, da?

332
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,990
Ok.

333
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,957
Na zdoroviye!

334
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,793
Na zdoroviye!

335
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,318
I'm careering

336
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,313
Down that slippery slope

337
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,473
Cos the thought of you won't go away...

338
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,191
Chris, this... was a one-off.

339
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,791
I don't have sex with
my 17-year-old students.

340
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,279
How old are they normally?

341
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,791
What are we gonna do about Maxxie?

342
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,509
- You should hear what he gets up to.
- I'm serious, Chris!

343
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,477
Ok, I'll have a word.

344
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,189
And you do know that this can never,

345
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,751
ever happen again, don't you?

346
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,478
Yeah.

347
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,151
Ok. So the plan is?

348
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,870
We get in, rescue her, get out.

349
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,999
Sid's a big hero. Anwar
gets his marbles gargled.

350
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,230
Simple.

351
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,115
Hello!

352
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,838
Helloski!

353
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,829
Hey!

354
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,512
Hello!

355
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,635
Anka!

356
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,835
Sshhhh!

357
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,592
We're gonna get you out of here.

358
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,556
Sid.

359
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,755
Shhh!

360
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,358
Tie this to the bed. Hurry up,
he's gonna come back. Come on.

361
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,112
Come on, come on, slowly.

362
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,194
Go.

363
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,077
No, no.

364
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,435
Trust me, yeah. Go.

365
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,033
He's gonna get you, go.

366
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,678
Come on, come on.

367
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,155
Trust me.

368
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,199
Sid, keep watch!

369
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,519
Agh!

370
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,999
Agh!

371
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,469
Anka.

372
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,833
Every time. Every fucking time.

373
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,799
"Buy two ounces of weed,
Sidney." "Oh, yes, sir!"

374
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,158
"Shove a bag of pills up your
arse, Sidney." "Oh, right away!"

375
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,118
"Come help me save some
random bint." "Oh, could I?"

376
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,910
What have we learnt, Sidney?
Your friends are shitheads.

377
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,354
Ahhhhhhh!

378
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,435
Great.

379
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,157
Ummm...

380
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,878
me...

381
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,234
name...

382
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,276
Anwar.

383
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,672
Me... name... Anka.

384
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,914
If only you knew the things
I'd love to do to you.

385
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,879
Rub my fingers through your hair.

386
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,190
Kiss your lips.

387
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,077
Kiss your neck.

388
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,469
Come on your tits.

389
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,595
Sounds like fun.

390
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,673
- You speak English?!
- Ya hah!

391
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,315
I learnt from, like, so
the best American show ever.

392
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,789
How you doin'?

393
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,678
I'm like... horny.

394
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,394
Come on, this'll do.

395
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,310
This is awful. Let's go.

396
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,949
J, I've never left a bar without
being chatted up in my life.

397
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,792
Not about to break that record now.

398
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,795
- There's nobody in here!
- If you flaunt it, they'll come.

399
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,549
Unbelievable.

400
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,949
Flaunt it, J.

401
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,349
Can you be any harder?!

402
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,834
Nope.

403
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,512
Friends?

404
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,477
Friends!

405
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,830
Anwar's a fucking liar. Lies
to his mum all the fucking time.

406
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,117
No, no, no, fuck that.
He makes me lie for him.

407
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,189
Who's Anwar?

408
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,599
Friend.

409
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,079
Who's homo?

410
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,879
Me! Anwar hates me
cos I'm a fucking homo.

411
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,439
Anwar hate homo?

412
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,999
Yeah.

413
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,559
Anwar is friend?

414
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,358
Yeah.

415
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,958
So, Anwar has problem. No,
Maxxie. Valentina help Maxxie?

416
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,190
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

417
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,958
Maxxie help Valentina?

418
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,712
Of course.

419
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,551
You want me to draw you?

420
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,073
Ok.

421
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,272
Urgh.

422
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,114
Kalinka, malinka, kalinka maya

423
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,954
Kalinka, malinka, malinka maya

424
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,589
Kalinka, malinka, malinka mayal

425
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,832
Three condomski down, 19 to go.

426
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,709
- Did you draw this?
- No.

427
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,994
He did.

428
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,790
He must be a good friend.

429
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,031
He'll be there for you when
the rain starts to fall.

430
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,510
Maybe not. He's pretty angry with me.

431
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,318
Why?

432
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,119
Cos I told the truth.
And that's important.

433
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,157
But what about you? You've
got bigger problems than me.

434
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,470
Anka, you can't go home back to him.

435
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,870
You should come home with
me. I'll look after you.

436
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,952
Anwar, don't lie to
me, it's not possible.

437
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,917
It is! Just, look...

438
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,118
We can live together in my
house. I'll look after you.

439
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,192
There may be one or two little
hiccups with the parents,

440
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,158
but I'm sure it'll be fine.

441
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,034
Guys! Guys! Sporty Spice
has finally arrived.

442
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,395
Anwar's in there with
a bloody Russian girl!

443
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,629
Tony, man, shhh!

444
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,712
What? Don't act like you
don't want everyone to see.

445
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,994
She's fit, though, ain't she?

446
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,514
Yo, yo, homies, what's happenin'?

447
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,954
- Yeah, she is fit. You must have paid for her.
- Yeah, Anwar, you pimp.

448
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,474
- Aye, what's poppin', baby love?
- Oi!

449
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,630
Perhaps she wants a
taste of the Kenneth.

450
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,870
Right, not to be boring
old teacher, yeah.

451
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,951
I mean, it's all gravy
with me, you know, but...

452
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,712
Sid!

453
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,197
You'd not believe what
I've just been through.

454
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,629
I jumped out of a window,

455
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,712
got chased into a bush,
waded through a river,

456
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,032
all the while being chased
by your nutter of a dad.

457
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,588
But it's ok, though,
cos I reckon I lost him.

458
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,112
Eurgh. Why's she kissing her dad?

459
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,270
- Anka?
- He's my husband.

460
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,554
Your husband?

461
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,676
We were on a break.

462
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,951
I'm sorry! I didn't know!

463
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,951
Leave him alone. Leave him alone.

464
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,075
Oh, my giddy aunt! Can
we be sensible about this?

465
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,308
Stop it, now! That's
enough, Maxxie. Now.

466
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,915
Can we talk? Can we talk?

467
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,433
Nyet!!

468
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,513
- Honestly, we leave you alone two hours.
- And look what happens.

469
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,713
Um...

470
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,272
He totally, like, wants to
know who is the leader here.

471
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,558
Yes, yes, officer, yes. Um, officer...

472
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,473
I wanted to thank you, er...
because before you arrived

473
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,232
I was about to step
in and kick some arse.

474
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,708
There is a charge for armed response.

475
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,758
Wh... what?

476
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,354
It's, like, you so totally
will have to pay them.

477
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,633
You English big hooligan problem.

478
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,188
Tomorrow you leave Russia.

479
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,229
Hey. You ok?

480
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,676
Man... you tried to save me.

481
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,593
Yeah. Well, I am fucking drunk.

482
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,596
You were right, Max.

483
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,111
I am a hypocrite.

484
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,075
- Go on.
- No. I can't.

485
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,957
It's not right.

486
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,753
It's religion, Anwar. It's just stuff.

487
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,112
You don't have to believe in it.

488
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,509
Then where does that leave me, Max?

489
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,556
I'm a Muslim boy.

490
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,279
I don't get to choose.

491
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,193
But where does that leave us?

492
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,752
Fucking hell.

493
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,229
I lost my virginity tonight.

494
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,072
Yeah?

495
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,752
Let's get us an old fat lady.

496
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,593
Last drop?

497
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,116
Ok.

498
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,236
I'll see you, mate.

499
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,429
- Hey, it's
He-Man. - Shut up.

500
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,637
Poor girl's totally out of
it. She's completely wasted.

501
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,553
Tony, you've got to stop fucking around.

502
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,796
I dare you.

503
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,431
Tony.

504
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,034
We've finally found
something you're not good at.

505
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,314
What?

506
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,158
Good night, Tony.

507
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,312
I'll find somewhere else to sleep.

508
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,471
What?

509
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,798
Oh, God.

510
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,313
Problem?

511
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,675
Tom, just shut up.

512
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,999
Hey, Cassie. That's good.

513
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,308
Ta.

514
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,119
She really looks...

515
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,193
- You made her look beautiful.
- She is beautiful.

516
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,830
- Tony.
- Yes, Nips?

517
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,354
Have you got something to tell me?

518
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,590
Er... I dunno.

519
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,830
I like your hair.

520
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,229
No. Your top's nice.

521
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,754
I love you? Any of those?

522
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,114
No.

523
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,917
Ahh. Oh, hang on.

524
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,512
I think it's...

525
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,795
I think I'm about to deliver!

526
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,440
Great. Just in time
for Heathrow security.

527
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,910
- Huh?
- Yeah. I hear they're very strict.

528
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,676
- Better keep it up there.
- Oh, God.

529
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,752
Oh, God.
