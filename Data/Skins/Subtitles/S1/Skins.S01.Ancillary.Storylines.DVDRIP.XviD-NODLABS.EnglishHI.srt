00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,713
- Boo!
- (Gasps)

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,075
Cassie, I said <i>four</i> o'clock.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,469
Did you? Look at your hair.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,755
It's so long.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,114
Wow.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,713
I must have been away for ages.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,075
Yeah.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,513
Oh...

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,548
A welcome home present.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,756
I got Chris to roll it especially.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,308
Perfectly cylindrical.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,955
A little shuttle out to space.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,908
But...

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,958
- I don't smoke any more.
- The clinic actually worked this time?

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,272
I still do pills and everything,
just not things that make me hungry.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,919
I've got a favour to ask you.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,116
- Basically, I really need you to...
- OK.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,156
I haven't told you what it is yet.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,959
It doesn't matter. I'm sure it's something nice.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,996
Well, sort of.

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,072
Tony's got this party tonight
that he wants us to go to,

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,233
- and you know his mate, Sid?
- Do I? Maybe.

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,348
Well, basically, he's totally in love with me, and
I really need you to shag him at this thing.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,715
- You'll do that, won't you, Cassie?
- Sure.

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,552
Thanks. I knew you would.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,840
Oh, my God! We <i>have</i> to go in.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,751
Oh, totally. It's essential.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,679
When I get married, I'm going to
wear a dress just like this.

30
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,398
I'll be Tony, you be Michelle.

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,793
You can't.

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,279
She's watching.

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,349
Excuse me.

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,512
I don't think this is quite the place for you.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,433
Excuse me. My best friend is pregnant.

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,638
They were using condoms and everything,
but did you know, they're only <i>9</i>8%% % effective?

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,633
The man's doing the right thing, though,
isn't he, Michelle? She's very upset.

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,756
- She isn't showing.
- I know. Thank God!

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,752
And spunk is basically pure fat,
so she's really lucky.

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,149
Amazing figure. She'll be such a beautiful bride.

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,117
(Faint.)

42
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,679
(- What?
- Faint.)

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,109
- Oh, my God, I...
- She's always doing this!

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,237
And everything got a bit ectopic
a few weeks ago. Very difficult.

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,278
I need a glass of water,
and smelling salts, if you have them.

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,952
Water, quick!

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,594
Now, to the church.

WEDDING MARCH PLAYS

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,434
You just turned us into
the most visible fugitives ever.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,638
Oh. Well, yeah, but she was a nasty person
and nasty people don't count.

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,951
That's one of my new <i>me</i> resolutions -
nasty people don't count.

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,600
- New me?
- Yeah, you know,

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,272
new me.

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,316
Like old me, only better.

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,589
I missed you, Cassie.

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,274
- I missed you too.
- No, I mean it.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,396
I really missed you.

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,993
I love you, you know?

59
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,112
Yeah, I mostly do.

Hello, careers needer.

I am your careers tweaker.

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,035

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,870
Hi, Chris. Sorry, have a seat.

71
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,633
Sorry, I made you a name sticker.

72
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,869
Oh. Cheers.

73
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,033
Um, hello, careers needer.
I am a careers seeker.

74
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,678
That's not right.

75
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,079
Um... I'm Josie.

76
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,913
- Hi. Um, welcome.
- You're welcome.

77
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,152
I mean, thank you.

78
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,958
Oh. OK. Um...

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,828
So let's start by going through
your careers finder questionnaire.

80
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,751
Sorry, I've forgotten your name.

81
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,199
- Chris.
- Chris. Thanks. OK.

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,273
Where it says, "Describe your ideal career",

83
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,759
um,

84
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,115
you've just drawn a picture of a snail.

85
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,269
Yeah.

86
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,472
Um, so have you thought about a career?
What would you like to do?

87
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,630
Right, I was thinking about this.

88
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,915
And there was this guy, yeah, called Brunel,

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,150
he just built bridges and ships and that.

90
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,516
- And he was just...
- So, you want to be an engineer?

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,238
Not an engineer, no.

92
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,754
I'm a lover, not a builder. Right?

93
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,276
But I dunno, I guess maybe
it's, like, his attitude that I admire.

94
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,078
OK.

95
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,392
That's not really a specific career in itself.

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,358
Have you got any other ideas?

97
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,230
There's this other guy -
invented the steam train, Stephenson.

98
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,639
Fucking mad, man.

99
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,518
He basically said,
"I want these trains to go fast,

100
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,192
"so I'm going to use a kettle."

101
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,032
I mean, a fucking kettle!

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,317
- Again, so is that the attitude?
- Attitude, yeah.

103
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,234
OK, so, have you got any ideas for...

104
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,231
<i>actual</i> careers?

105
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,311
Do you think the title Renaissance Man
sounds a bit wanky?

106
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,440
It's just... I don't know how I'd
categorise that. I don't know what section...

107
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,555
Renaissance Man.

108
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,518
OK, to give a thing, right,

109
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,794
my mate Anwar, yeah?

110
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,950
His mum's always making these curries.

111
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,554
Literally, the best curry
you'll ever eat in your life.

112
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,519
She's always got a surplus, cos she's
trying to fatten him up. But I was thinking,

113
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,038
maybe I could, like, deliver that
surplus to, you know, just to people.

114
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,997
Check this out.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,036
Huh?

116
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,997
Curry Me Up, Chris.

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,196
Ha! I totally had an idea like that.

118
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,192
But what I was gonna do was
I was gonna make a big vat of soup,

119
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,350
and then sell that at festivals.

120
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,399
Going round all different festivals,
talking to people and giving them the soup.

121
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,472
Exactly. Because, why should all
the homeless people get all the soup?

122
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,109
Give us the fucking soup!
You could go to festivals and find

123
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,512
loads of people on, like,
massive pill come-downs, right?

124
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,752
Give a bit of chunky soup, and they'd,
like, fucking explode with happiness.

125
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,833
It's... No, it's not charity, it's... it's beauty.

126
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,515
- That's exactly what I'm talking about.
- Well, that's catering.

127
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,672
- I can get you loads of leaflets. There's...
- Also...

128
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,397
Is there a way that I could invent cocktails?

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,194
Um...

130
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,516
Yeah, I suppose... Definitely. Definitely.

131
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,272
Right, OK.

132
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,272
I reckon I'd make an excellent mixologist.

133
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,595
Um... Is there toothpaste in this?

134
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,680
Hi. I'm going to become
a professional clarinettist.

135
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,916
I'll start by auditioning for
the Royal College of Music, but failing that,

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,116
get onto a good university course for music

137
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,839
and then go back to the Royal College
for a Masters.

138
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,955
Musician.

139
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,589
That's brilliant.

140
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,799
SHE SIGHS DEEPLY

141
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,958
Oh, I could totally get you
a leaflet, if you want...

142
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,953
It's OK, I've already sent off
for all the prospectuses I'm interested in.

143
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,871
Well, that's brilliant.

144
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,834
Can I go?

145
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,117
Sorry, it's supposed to last 15 minutes, so...

146
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,077
SIGHS

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,069
(Sorry.)

148
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,391
A musician!

149
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,349
PLAYS A NOTE

150
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,829
Got that... Sorry.

151
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,476
So let's look at your options
and make positive connections

152
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,599
to the world of the workplace
for you, name of test recipient.

153
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,709
Did you just read that off that sheet?

154
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,316
Yeah. Sorry, I just think
it's a really beautiful sentence.

155
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,558
Um...

156
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,838
So, let's find the key to unlock
your ideal career.

157
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,114
OK?

158
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,670
Um, so your computer test results...

159
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:47,075
It says here that your best two options are
landfill waste consultant,

160
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,151
and, oh...

161
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,356
It just says landfill waste consultant.

162
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,557
So, which of those two options

163
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,789
takes your fancy?

164
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,235
Landfill waste consultant?

165
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,517
Cos it'd be really good for me
if you could choose that.

166
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,870
What have you thought
about doing in the future?

167
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,715
Well, I'd like to do something
that doesn't involve too much work.

168
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,028
OK.

169
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,479
Landfill waste consultant?

170
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,835
Brilliant. I'll get you a leaflet.

171
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,992
Why do you think
just that one's come up in the results?

172
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,755
Well, let's go through your responses. OK?

173
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,469
Where it says, "What are your job skills?",

174
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,314
you've put, "What's the point?
I'm a waste of space."

175
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,630
So, I guess, "waste".

176
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,188
"Would you prefer to work inside or outside?"

177
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,352
And you've written, "I wish a hole in the ground
would swallow me up."

178
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,956
So, I guess, "landfill". And then it says,
"What are your hobbies?"

179
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,952
- And you've put "Michelle"...
- (He mouths)

180
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,952
...and then, written six question marks.

181
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,873
So I guess it got consultant from there.

182
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,599
It's quite clever, really. Landfill, waste...

183
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,831
I don't want to be a landfill waste consultant.

184
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,151
- Is there no way I can change it?
- Not really.

185
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,199
I didn't want to be a careers adviser either.
I did a computer test and it said I should do it.

186
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,115
I wanted to be a carer, but I spelt it wrong,
and they will not let you go back. Can't.

187
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,395
Why don't you just switch jobs?

188
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,948
I wouldn't know how to do that.

189
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,794
Well, just use one of these or something.

190
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,996
Make A Change, Your Ideal Career.

191
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,437
Don't Delay, Move For
A Meaningful Career Today.

192
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,229
Or, Switching Careers, It's For You.

193
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,115
Oh, but... These are for the students.

194
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,998
Well, I can help you
go through them, if you want.

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,198
Have you thought about being
a careers adviser? You'd be perfect.

196
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,272
(Both) Shit!

197
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,590
This is gonna be showa.

198
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,558
A'right, a'right, a'right. Here's the drilling.

199
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,599
Cool, innit, beco you know they must be used
to be getting this on a regular.

200
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,514
I say we go up on a chirps inflection,
you get me? Our shit's got to be on point.

201
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,639
Cos you don' know we're gonna see
that showa Stuart Elmore.

202
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,517
Stu! Stu! Stu! Stu! Stu!

203
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,593
And he's linked, man.
He's got more links than the chains

204
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,352
that used to keep the black man bound.

205
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,670
He's gonna be <i>on</i> the mix tape.

206
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,988
It's all up in here.

207
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,629
But homeboy, you know it ain't
the same without Milky, man.

208
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,473
Aiight.

209
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,758
(Sniffs) Minute's silence
for the semi-skinned one.

210
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,712
I ain't no one-minute man.

211
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,553
We gotta go up there.
We gotta be speaking <i>English</i>.

212
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,517
Standard. Standardly, blood.

213
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,033
Standardly! Yeah?

214
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,793
Like the reigning Queen Victoria, you get me?

215
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,269
I don't know, G.

216
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,078
Why go on if they mirk off our boats?

217
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,832
It is what it is.

218
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,629
There ain't no milk in the coffee,
the coffee's got to learn to speak milk.

219
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,631
- Get me?
- But...

220
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,234
Don't be on no negi hype, blood.

221
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
'Member the motto.

222
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,032
(Both) Shoot 'em up, bang, bang,
props to the hood. You get me?

223
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,439
Get me! Come.

224
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,159
Salutations!

225
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,438
It would be spiffing to grab
a mo with Mr Stu Elmore, Esquire,

226
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,873
the jockey of discs.

227
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,072
Abracadabra, Lynton.

228
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,948
Would you be so kind as to show her
what we have inside our humble carrier.

229
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,072
Wagwan?

230
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,795
What's up, rudeboy?

231
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,195
It's a fruit, I tink.

232
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,918
Where's the mixtape, homeboy?

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,638
I don't know. In Jal's juicer?

234
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,711
I must've got the goods wrong, innit?

235
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,917
I don't think we can still showa this, blad.

236
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,877
Don't be a pussy.

237
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,915

I'm going to try and get you on.

252
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,956
Hiya, Stuart. Listen,

254
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,032
I mean, I really think you should
get them on the radio now.

255
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,951
Yeah, I'll send them up.

We're going to have lots of sunshine.

264
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,311
A bit chilly with highs of about ten degrees.
It's going to stay dry for the rest of the week.

Wow.

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,271
- Hi, Cass.
- I really like your top.

291
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,952
- It's cool.
- Cheers.

292

293
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,114
- What?
- Oh, it's not for me.

294
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,272
It's just a friend of mine is naked.
Yeah, so...

295
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,635
A fiver says she won't get anything.

296
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,199
I'll take that.

297
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,158
Oh, come on! That's easy.

Cass, Cass. Get his jeans too.

299
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,270
I think that's going to be a bit tricky.

300
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,952
Yeah.

301
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,638
Hey, George.

302
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,676
Do you wanna bet?

303
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,718
- Tenner says you can't.
- Watch and learn, suckers.

304
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,236
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hey. You all right?

305
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,232
Got a quick question.
Can I possibly borrow your jeans?

306
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,358
Fuck, she's good.

307
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,158
Tenner says she can't.

308
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,712
All right!

309
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,588
- I don't really wanna walk around naked.
- No...

310
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,193
I'm sorry, I can't.

311
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,429
I'm sorry.

312
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,714
Fuck!

313
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,838
She blew it!

314
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,478
Double or quits?

315
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,913
What?

316
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,072
- Double or quits, I can get George's jeans.
- I'll take it.

317
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,513
Hey, Georgie.

318
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,070
What happened there?
I just can't understand it.

319
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,599
Fuck!

320
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,469
But how did he...?

321
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,959
George!

322
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,190
Bollocks! The whole fucking world's gay.

Hey, Chris. Trousers.

324
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,233
Everyone's talking about some
naked guy who's in school.

325
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,518
They were trying to work out whether you're
making some kind of political statement.

326
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,272
- T-shirt any good?
- I think you'll like it.

327
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,874
I didn't think anyone'd notice.

328
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,791
Yeah. Maybe a few did.

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,515

Sid.

339
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,877
I can't do the job that I've got,

340
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,155
and I can't even apply to get another one.

341
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,152
Erm... I was just ringing,
just for your help, really.

342
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,835
Cos you just seem really together,
and I thought maybe...

343
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,194
BEEP

344
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,316
'The inbox for this number is full.'

345
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,039
The way of the ninja...

346
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,678
is stealth.

347
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,919
I'm here because I've been told
that you are the one

348
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,877
that can show me the path.

349
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,514
Erm, I don't know what you're talking about,
I'm the careers officer.

350
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,879
That's what I'm talking about - stealth,
one-inch punches, ripping people's hearts out.

351
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,996
I can retract my testicles

352
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,674
with the power... of my mind.

353
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,434
What do you think?

354
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,994
What?

355
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,594
A brown man can't be a ninja, huh?

356
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,511
Is that it?

357
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,953
I'll show you.

358
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,393
Aargh!

359
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,110
Taooooooow-aargh!

360
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,116
Aaaaaaaaargh!

361
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,109
Teh!

362
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,275
Wow.

363
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,032
That's nang, innit?

364
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,509
So, who can you hook me up with?

365
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,989
The Chinese Triads.

366
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,548
Ooh, the Italian Mafia. Mm.

367
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,871
I just wanna be a trained kille-e-e-e-er!

368
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,878
Oh, and help the poor and shit,

369
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,518
on the side.

370
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,798
I can't help you.

371
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,796
You're just like my mum.

372
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,108
No, Anwar.

373
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,713
Be a doctor.

374
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,189
No assassination for you.

375
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,909
What's the point?

376
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,714
MOANING

377
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,879
Look, can we get this over with, please?

378
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,518
Mm.

379
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,831
Your questionnaire says that you can be...

380
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,720
pretty much whatever you want.

381
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,400
What did you want to be when you grew up?

382
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,232
Elvis.

383
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,352
You wanted to be like Elvis?

384
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,516
No. I literally wanna be Elvis.

385
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,397
You know...

386
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,995
Sing rock'n'roll, become the King,
die on the toilet.

387
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,638
I think it's romantic.

388
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,878
Mm.

389
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,349
This is wrong.

390
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,352
I just wanted to make a difference.

391
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,670
What? More a Beatles fan?

392
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,794
This is a waste of my time.

393
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,879
Hippy.

394
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,991
SHE MOANS

395
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,034
DOOR CLOSES

396
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,033
Erm...

397
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,997
Are you all right?

398
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,152
Yeah. I'm quite comfortable, actually.

399
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,549
It's cosy in here, it's a bit like a shell.

400
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,878
- This is pointless.
- I know.

401
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,315
I don't understand why I thought
you'd be any different.

402
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,914
- No-one takes me seriously.
- What?

403
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,037
I'm just like the brainless pretty girl, right?

404
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,272
Actually, your questionnaire shows
you've got a good head for languages.

405
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,033
Have you thought about going to university?

406
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,678
They wouldn't have me.

407
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,995
Would they?

408
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,672
Would you like to go?

409
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,228
I know it sounds stupid, but...

410
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,629
Cette une bonne idee!

411
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,199
Vraiment.

412
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,598
Merci beaucoup.

413
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,155
Oh, la, la.

414
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,913
C'est rien. Absolument rien.

415
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,672
Un petit accident.

416
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,034
OK.

417
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,388
I... Listen. Erm...

418
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,598
I know it sounds silly and I don't even think
I know the French for it but...

419
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,319
would you like to look through
some prospectuses with me?

420
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,551
Are you sure? I don't want to waste your time.

421
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,677
Oh, no. I've got time.

422
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,039
There's courses all over the country.

423
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,237
You can pretty much take your pick
wherever you'd want to study.

424
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,834
Far, far away!

425
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,595
Well, what about the University of Strathclyde?

426
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,114
Wow! Strathclyde?!

427
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,919
I'm not even sure where that is,
but as you can see...

428
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,549
- Does it have a good reputation?
- Not really.

429
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,950
It was the first town that I could think of
that was a long way away...

430
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,395
Go on, then. What did everyone make?

431
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,915
- 2.45.
- £4.21.

432
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,274
Effy's sponsored silence.

433
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,078
£13.57 from my career fund.

434
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,230
And Chris better be worth it
because...

435
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,231
HE FARTS

436
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,719
Oh, shit.

437
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,756
Which way is the toilet?

438
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,311
That was one magic day.

439
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,914
You made loads, did you? Wicked.

440
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,470
I didn't want people's money, man.
I wanted their respect.

441
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,994
I gave the complete fish experience.

442
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,153
- Jokes, impressions...
- So you didn't make anything?

443
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,559
Why this obsession with money, man?

444
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,677
I don't know. Maybe because without it,
you <i>won't</i> be going to Russia.

445
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,990
Course I'm going to Russia. We all are.

446
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,479
Chris, you've got no money.

447
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,437
I need £700 by tomorrow or you're not going.

448
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,476
Tomorrow?

449
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,518
That's like... not long.

450
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,189
Well, how much have you all made, then?

451
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,157
All together?

452
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,195
Not even 30 quid.

453
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,668
But... But I've got to go to Russia.

454
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,557
Everyone's gonna be there,

455
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,119
like Angie.

456
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,349
I've gotta go.

457
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,034
I can't just... I can't...

458
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,114
(Breathless) Cathy... fucking Barry...
In the bar...

459
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,111
Here.

460
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,553
Now.

461
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,835
The UK's biggest porn star, man.

462
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,998
I would have stopped to talk to her
but I thought, "How do I compose myself?"

463
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,793
Compose yourself.

464
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,315
Plus, when you've just taken one of those
curry shits and the smell kinda lingers...

465
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,709
Yeah, right, Anwar. There's no chance

466
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,429
that Cathy Barry would choose to spend
her afternoon in a shitty little pub.

467
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,475
Tony...

468
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,150
RAUNCHY MUSIC PLAYS

469
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,909
(Breathlessly) Those lips.

470
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,314
Those curves.

471
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,029
34 double fucking J's.

472
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,671
I've seen all of her films.

473
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,796
I've <i>got</i> all of her films.

474
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,996
Deep Desires.

475
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,195
Titfuck Frenzy.

476
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,510
(Oh, yeah. Titfuck Frenzy.)

477
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,511
Secret Garden Sex.

478
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,953

Dirty English Bitches.

480
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,437
Oh, yeah!

481
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,195
And, of course, Saturday Night Beavers.

482
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,793
Oh, that film was a treasure.

483
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,716
ANWAR PANTS

484
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,038
How do I look, boys?

485
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,554
How do I look?

486
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,629
Leave this to the master, yeah?

487
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,870
Oh, no.
You ain't getting first dibs on everyone, Tony.

488
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,111
- D'you think she likes glasses?
- No, she likes tall Asians, man.

489
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,873
And if she doesn't, she should.

490
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,313
Dudes.

491
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,630
We're supposed to be talking about
Chris's crisis.

492
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,753
- I said first.
- Actually, Tony, I said first.

493
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,114
I actually <i>did</i> say first.

494
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,872
<i>I'm</i> going.

495
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,509
But you're gay.

496
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,798
I'm gonna go over and ask if she likes
the look of any of you, which she won't.

497
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,556
But... It's my lines that make me the man I am.

498
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,709
Just leave this to me.

499
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,878
I can't believe it.

500
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,678
Russia.

501
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,875
Gone.

502
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,439
(Sid) Cathy Barry.

503
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,355
My chance of eternal happiness, gone.

504
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,351
Cathy Barry!

505
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,919
Cathy Barry.

506
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,188
Well...

507
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,068
Amazingly, she actually is interested
in one of you.

508
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,999
- The master strikes again.
- Tony, sit down.

509
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,475
BOING!

510
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,429
BOING!

511
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,514
BOING!

512
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,752
BOING!

513
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,910
Will you stop doing that?
They have got some feeling, you know.

514
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,356
No, you're not dreaming, if you're thinking that.

515
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,355
Last night, well, you were very enthusiastic.

516
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,908
I don't...

517
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,515
I'm in love.

518
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,919
Ooh, I'm flattered.

519
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,195
No, with Angie. I'm in love with Angie.

520
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,479
I mean, OK, we're not <i>together</i> together
but, you know, unfaithful is still unfaithful,

521
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,551
even if the romance is only in the mind.

522
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,119
Calm down, babe.

523
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,196
Has anybody told you shagging a porn star
doesn't even count?

524
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,716
Cos if they were in the same situation,
they'd do exactly the same as you.

525
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,590
I'm big, I'm bouncy,
I'm shaggable and I don't count.

526
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,150
Just ask Charlie Sheen
if you don't believe me. It's the rules.

527
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,519
It doesn't matter, anyway.

528
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,160
Nothing's ever gonna happen
between me and Ange.

529
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,318
I thought, yeah, we'd go to Russia,

530
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,709
OK, sparks fly...

531
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,473
Fire burning, yeah?

532
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,156
But now I can't even got cos I can't afford
the £700 it's gonna cost for the trip.

533
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,678
Oh, is it first love, is it?

534
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,637
Mm.

535
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,353
I was in love once,

536
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,479
but he wanted me to stop it at double D

537
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,951
so now I throw myself into meaningless sex,
wherever the opportunity arises.

538
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,517
Yeah.

539
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,239
I think I might start doing that.

540
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,709
£700.

541
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,756
Will you take a cheque?

542
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,991
You what? Really?

543
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,435
On one condition.

544
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,873
Name it.

545
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,396
I don't remember your name.

546
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,155
Darling, where we're going,
names doesn't even matter.

547
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,531
Oh, fucking men!

548
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,737
Tony, Josh, Malcolm and
his Noah's Ark second fucking coming.

549
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,538
- I think they're quite cute.
- No, they're not.

550
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,939
They're fucking awful.

551
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,575
Whoops.

552
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,208
Come on, 'Chelle. Forget about them.

553
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,211
Let's try and have fun. Yeah?

554
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,333
It's supposed to be happy hour.

555
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,694
Check them out!

556
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,573
And they wanna buy us a drink.

557
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,093
We've got drinks.

558
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,259
Why am I the duck?!

559
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,855
It's not fair! You get to be the sexy
cat on the prowl

560
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,613
whilst I flirt around in a puddle
getting stale bread thrown at me.

561
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,498
Yeah, but you're loved
by old ladies and children.

562
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,777
- OK, well at least I'm not the dog.
- That's true.

563
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,259
Googly-eyed,

564
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,535
an erect tail,

565
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,848

566
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,009
(Both) Anwar!

567
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,056
And Sid is so the frog.

568
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,459
Agreed.

569
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,056
So as Sid the frog plans to sow his seed
in the domesticated cat, Michelle...

570
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,419
...an entirely different species, which the
rules of nature prove is absolutely impossible.

571
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,331
BOTH LAUGH

572
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,934
And then, there's Tony.

573
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,215
Who's Tony?

574
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,775
Ice.

575
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,453
Cold and transparent.

576
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,292
Makes sense.

577
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,211
OK, ice it is.

578
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,849
But ice has completely different plans.

579
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,054
Abigail and the Ya Ya's.

580
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,895
(Posh accent) Ya, I'm totally in love with
your boyfriend. Why can't you understand?

581
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,893
(Posh accent) You cock-sucking,
shit-spouting, horse-fuckerer!

582
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,129
Erm, Jal...

583
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,734
- Are we weird?
- Yes.

584
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,775
Tempted?

585
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,935
Very.

586
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,136
Go on. Go get them for us.

587
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,337
I can't go and get them looking like this!

588
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,258
So it's very simple.

589
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:08,256
Either you, erm, stroke the pussy,

590
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,615
or you fuck the duck.

591
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,648
Ooh!

592
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,129
I still don't see why I have to be the duck.

593
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,896
Ducky, are you having some problems
accepting who you are?

594
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,972
Ah, you don't believe in yourself.

595
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,096
You can't take who you are.

596
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,091
Ah, isn't that right, ducky duck?

597
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,853
- Quack, quack, quack...
- Quack, quack, quack...

598
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,170
Quack, quack...

600
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,256
Where did they go?

601
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,568
Oh.

602
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,577
Maybe... Were we not lady-like enough?

603
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,209
Maybe they weren't feeling our animal instinct.

604
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,972
They weren't feeling anything at all.

605
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,779
Look, tell me the truth.

606
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,579
Does my beak look big in this?

There was...

610
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,936
There was a girl who could only live on
lemonade.

611
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,410
Or her parents were really old and rubbish
and just kept giving it to her

612
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,492
to the point where
she couldn't have anything else.

613
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,413
Or they were really nice and only gave it to her
cos they really liked her.

I can't decide that bit, but...

616
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,778
She could only live on lemonade.

00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,851
If she didn't have lemonade, she'd die.

618
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,615
And her parents were gonna die soon, too -
they had something wrong with them like...

619
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,055
their blood was blue or something like that.

620
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,051
And she had a brother, but...

621
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,416
he was really stupid,
so no-one really cared about him.

622
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,695
They just wanted their little girl to live.

623
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,055
The only trouble is...

624
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,252
...no-one thought about her brother.

625
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,898
She was in a bottle,

626
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,936
he was on his own.

627
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,499
No-one thought about him.

628
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,650
They just left him.

629
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,175
So he sat by her, her brother.

630
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,490
He sat by her in the bottle.

631
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,650
And cos lemonade helped her eyesight,

632
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,935
she could see him really clearly
through the sides

633
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,773
even though the glass
was as thick as a skull.

635
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,733
And cos it was the countryside,

636
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,890
there was nothing for him to eat

637
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,652
or nothing for him to buy.

639
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,052

640
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,573
And she could see that.

641
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,812
And there was no-one looking after him
and cos he was a bit stupid,

642
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,572
he couldn't look after himself.

643
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,094
And it kept on raining,
so he was getting a bit rusty.

644
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,738
SHE SNIFFS

645
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,335
She was having an amazing time
in the lemonade, but...

646
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,775
she knew she had to help him

647
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:13,298
so she swum to the surface,
but she couldn't get out, it was too far away.

648
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,450
This bottle was too big.

649
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,132
SHE SNIFFS

650
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,373
She knew she had to do something.

651
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,213
He was getting worse and worse and worse.

652
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,372
And he was really hungry and thirsty.

653
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,009
And he started eating grass
and puking up all the time.

654
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,614
So she tried to think of some plan for it.

655
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,531
But she couldn't.

656
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,134
All she knew was that he needed her with him.

657
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,570
All she could do was watch him
puke his guts up on the other side of the glass.

658
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,414
Ha! But then bingo, she knew.

659
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,252
She started to drink.

660
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,570
And she drank and she drank and she drank.

661
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,935
And this was a <i>lot</i> of lemonade.

662
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:58,218
Enough to last her until she died,
cos her parents wanted her to live for ages.

663
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,053
But she drank every last drop,

664
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,290
until she was in an empty bottle.

665
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,018
But that was no good.

666
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,579
She still couldn't get out.

667
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,175
But that was OK, cos she just waited

668
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,378
until she had a big one stored up
cos she drunk all the pop.

669
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,416
She drunk all the lemonade

670
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,730
and then she started her fart. Ha! Ha!

671
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,698
It was slow at first, but then
it was really loud and hard.

672
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:27,490
She blew her way out of the bottle,
straight through the top, like a rocket.

673
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,492
Then she stopped her brother eating grass.

674
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,378
And they went to find a nice little house
to live in together.

675
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,530
Her and her brother.

676
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,771
And it turned out that drinking all that lemonade
had cured her, cos...

677
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,498
she never wanted it again.

678
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,617
She had orange for the rest of her life.

679
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,253
I love this town.

680
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,855
When I look at it,
it's like it's always the first time.

681
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,535
Or the last.

682
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,930

00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,855

- Plus 7<i>9</i> for the bun.

738
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,494
A leaving present and if I shared it,
it wouldn't be a present any more.
