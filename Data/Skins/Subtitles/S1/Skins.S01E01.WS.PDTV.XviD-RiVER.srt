00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,036
We go to the party and we get a girI
catastrophicaIIy spIiffed up.

174
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,796
In her confused state, she comes to
beIieve, however momentariIy,

175
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,074
that you're attractive enough to shag.

176
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,073
- Who's the Iucky girI, then?
- I think you're gonna Iike this.

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,231
Oh, yes. You are a very,
very Iucky IittIe boy.

342
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,719
You got a probIem?

343
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,076
No, no, no.

344
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,675
Um, so you're a doctor, then?

345
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,235
Who said?

346
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,949
WeII, the Ph...D thing.

347
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,716
Yeah, yeah, you couId say that.
You couId say, um, pretty...huge...

348
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,755
..dick.

349
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,478
LAUGHS MANICALLY

350
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,675
Yeah!

351
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,990
CONTINUES TO LAUGH

352
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,479
Which?

353
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,198
Which?

354
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,759
Doctor, Pretty Huge Dick. Which?

355
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,234
Both?

356
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,355
I Iike you. What's up, kid?

357
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,635
I mean, do you wanna...

358
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,549
Do you wanna get Iaid?

359
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,073
Huh? How did you...?

360
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,479
I mean.

361
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,998
No, no. I was, er, Iooking
to maybe get some spIiff.

364
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,114
AbsoIuteIy not.

365
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,235
Show me some money.

366
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,550
Right, weII. That's the thing.

367
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,510
Cos someone said that maybe
I couId get the stuff, and pay, Iike...

368
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,832
..Iater?

369
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,070
- Woah.
- Oh, fuck!

370
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,948
Credit terms. That's just a whoIe
fucking shark attack there, right?

371
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,157
I quite understand.
Let's just forget...

372
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,153
No, fuck it. It's your game,
if you want to pIay it.

373
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,390
Do you wanna pIay?

374
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,154
Yeah, yeah... Yeah.

375
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,479
Um, how about an ounce of spIiff?

376
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,834
Three ounces it is.

377
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,948
<i>No, no, an ounce...of...spIiff.</i>

378
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,315
Three ounces.

379
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,313
That's three hundred pounds

380
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,356
of easy credit,

381
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,594
so you've got 48 hours to pay me.

382
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,275
SOFA CREAKS, BAGS RUSTLE

383
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,359
Have you got baIIs?

384
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,873
Yeah.

385
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,070
I'm just checking, because

386
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,071
your baIIs are your coIIateraI.

387
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,352
You got me?

388
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,556
Yeah.

389
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,232
After time, deniaI,

390
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,993
anger and bargaining wiII
give way to a depression.

391
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,232
In this phase the sense of emotionaI Ioss
is ampIified and may seem unbearabIe.

392
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,390
WEEPING

393
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,439
In this phase, the feeIings of Iow seIf-esteem
and hopeIessness are common.

394
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,718
But these wiII finaIIy give way, eventuaIIy,
to the finaI phase of acceptance...

395
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,552
WEEPING CONTINUES

396
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,791
..an understanding that what
has been Iost can never return,

397
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,189
and that Iife can continue
aIthough it may be very different.

Yup. It's AbigaiI's party. And we've
got to seII an ounce of dope.

453
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,589
Where is everyone?

Hang on. ''My deaIer''?

456
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,669
Anyway, I brought Cassie.
Cassie, you remember Sid, right?

457
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,880
Yeah, wow, IoveIy... No.
But I Iike that you're funny-Iooking.

- How's the treatment going, Cassie?
- Oh, it's cooI.

460
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,273

That's so nice.

00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,754
And I bet you won't even
make me eat anything.

473
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,070
No. No.

474
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,196
Thank you.

475
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,350
Right, great! Let's go in

476
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,716
It's three ounces.

00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,074
I got three ounces.

478
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,759
Hi, Abi.

479
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,832
Tony! LoveIy.

480
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,558

481
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,595
Sorry?

482
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,353
Yeah, this is MicheIIe,
Cassie and Sid.

483
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,589
Super.

484
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,477
Wow, you're IoveIy.

485
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,629
Super.

486
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,439
Where's the kitchen?
I want to see the kitchen.

487
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,239
It's through there. Come in.

488
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,753
Cheers.

Oh...shoes.

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,357
It's just that Mummy had this carpet
imported from Iran.

491
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,351
We have to be so,
so carefuI with the piIe.

492
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,715
Right, yep, sure.

Sorry.

494
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,473

00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,197
Can I get you some rum punch?

496
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,477
I'm afraid we're getting rather

497
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,757
Mmm, we Iove rum punch,

502
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,668
Sid? Is that PoIish or something?

503
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,910
No, I don't think so.

504
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,831
Danuta's PoIish. Danuta.

505
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,111
She doesn't speak EngIish.

506
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,192
But you can just speak to her
in ItaIian or in French.

507
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,999
She Iikes you.

508
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,957

695
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,515
The dope's gone.

696
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,160
At Ieast we've got our heaIth.

<i>Chicken feet scratch out a beat</i>

<i>While head rolls on the ground</i>

<i>Lookin' for a piece of meat</i>

701
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,715
<i>And sleep in eiderdown</i>

702
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:51,190
<i>I walked a million miles</i>

703
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,478
<i>I crawled a million more...</i>

704
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,994
For God's sakes,

706
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,390
Why do you have to get up so earIy?

Just getting ready.

708
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,552
Anybody wouId think you wanted
the neighbours to see you.

709
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,153
Do you hear me, woman?
