00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,631
I am your mother!
Have you taken your medication?

186
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,472
WeII, take it now...
Now!

187
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,034
So...

188
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,634
before you Ieave us
to start your new Iife,

189
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,316
it's important that you understand, um...

190
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,358
- Cassie.
- Cassie!

191
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,149
That if you are troubIed again,
then you treat us

192
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,028
as a pIace of safety and refuge.

193
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,236
We Iike to think of Restoration

194
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,633
as a big famiIy you can re-visit
any time it's necessary.

195
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,235
Here's my card with
the emergency number...

196
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,915
CaIIs after six are doubIe.

197
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,230
We're aII on your side.

198
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,869
Providing you have arrangements
in pIace for the fees.

199
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,154
How does that sound?

200
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,879
LoveIy. I'm so gratefuI, reaIIy.

201
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,109
Good.

202
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,077
Thank you, Carrie.

203
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,310
You may go to Group CongratuIations.

204
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,431

205
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,953
Thank you so much.

206
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,238
APPLAUSE

207
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,911
WeII done, Cassie.

208
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,037
We'II miss you. Won't we?

209
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,917
Wow. Thanks everyone.

210
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,356
Right... Who's next?

211
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,873
Madison.

212
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,590
Can we congratuIate you?

213
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,438
No, I'm not happy.

214
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,074
You!

215
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,388
You're staring at me.

216
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,914
No-one's staring at you, Madison.
Are we?

217
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,549
(Group) No... No...

218
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,870
Now. What's been troubIing you?

219
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,595
I keep teIIing myseIf that maybe
I'm a bit over-sensitive, you know,

220
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,229
and it's... It's starting to work.

221
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,833
There's no more...

222
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,388
no more voices going,
''Ba ba ba ba ba,''

223
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,190
no more voices whispering,
you know, ''Ba-ba...''

224
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,589
And then... And then...

225
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,513
Spit it out Madison.
We're here for you, aren't we?

226
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,397
(Group) We are...

227
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,310
PerfectIy straightforward
business deaI, right?

228
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,710
This kid asks me for credit terms
and I'm Iike...

229
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,075
''trust''...

230
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,832
Yeah?

231
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,629
WeII done, Madison.

232
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,110
The onIy thing that I ask...

233
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,350
is repayment...

234
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,910
in a cIearIy defined scheduIe.

235
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,355
So I give him what he wants.

236
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,793
What did he want?

237
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,757
Goods and services...

238
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,269
This fat fuck.

239
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,992
This deceiving, scheming
IittIe pIuke!

240
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,230
He thinks...

241
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,757
that he can get away
with cheating me out of my money...

242
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,753
Maybe he wasn't trying
to cheat you, Madison.

243
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,034
Oh, yeah?

244
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,190
It's a misunderstanding.

245
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,632
ReaIIy?

246
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,960
We need you to work on this,
Madison.

247
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,478
WeII, I'm working on it!

248
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,913
I'm working on it.

249
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,799
Er, chips, pIease.

250
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,119
Few more.

251
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,073
Just a few more.

252
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,669
Cheers!

253
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,274

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,915
Bummer.

260
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,877
Go on, then.

261
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,915
You sure?

262
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,788

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,275
Oh, do stop it, OK?

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,354
Come on, Cass.
I mean you never eat anything.

306
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,715
Your parents must notice
or something.

307
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,916
I dunno.

308
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,274

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,515
You do that whiIe you're cutting

313
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,794
Where's your Student Card?

326
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,509

There you go. Job done.

335
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,912
That's impressive.

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,955
Cheers.

337
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,112
But aren't you kind of, you know,

I'm so better.
I got discharged from the cIinic.

339
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,116

341
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,957

00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,993
Oh, wow.

343

But you see...

344
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,676

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,309
And it's not exactIy
Iike anybody cares, so...

00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,076

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,111
Sometimes I wonder why you even

OK.

388
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,672
This guy from my group
therapy's got your ID card.

389
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,230
And he's a crazy fuck and he
hates you because you cheated him.

390
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,833
What's his name?

391
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,512
He Iikes to be caIIed Mad.

00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,555

00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,435
This is a room for femaIe staff.

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,638
Yeah. The drier's broken in ours.

400

Ah, there you are.

We gotta do something. I mean, you

403
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,995
Oh, you wankers.
That was weII funny, man.

404
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,279
But someone's gonna have to apoIogise

405
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,955
Oh, Jesus Christ,
HoIy Mary, Mother of God!

406
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,473
That's Angie! Don't Iook! Get out!

407
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,232
For fuck's sake! Fuck off!

408
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,515
< Sorry, Angie.

409
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,193
You stiII got it.

410
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,794
Get out of there
and don't Iook at her, aII right?

411
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,477
You Iike me. You Iike me.

412
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,357
Look up if you Iike me.

413
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,193
Look up if you Iike me.

414
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,073
Look up if you Iike me.

415
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,470
Oh, bugger.

416
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,995
Shit!

417
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,278
Oh! Sid.

418
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,920
Hi. Sorry, Angie.

419
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,514
You shouIdn't go into
the staff showers, Sid.

420
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,592
I know, I know.
It was a crisis.

421
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,639
WeII, it's just a bit
embarrassing that's aII.

422
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,393
ActuaIIy, I'm pretty
confident about my body...

423
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,790
No, I'm having a crisis.

424
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,313
Oh.

425
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:47,839
WeII, sometimes aduIt bodies can be
a IittIe overwheIming.

426
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,037
Oh, for Christ's sake, Angie,
I don't care about your tits!

427
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,799
Oh.

428
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,919
I'm in deep, deep, deep shit.

429
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,836
Right.

430
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,956
OK.

431
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,758
You need advice?

432
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,355
I need advice and 300 quid.

433
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,830
Otherwise someone's going to
be re-possessing my boIIocks.

434
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,715
OK, weII Iook, when it comes to debt,

435
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,031
the best thing to do is to face up
to it before it gets out of hand.

436
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,109
Yeah?

437
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,556
Yeah. AII you have to do is go
to the person you owe money to

438
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,916
and caImIy ask them to
rescheduIe the payments.

439
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,798
RescheduIe payments?
So that's one baII now

440
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,916
and then the baIance next week.

441
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,834
BeIieve me, Sid,
I'm a responsibIe aduIt.

442
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,150
I know. OK?

443
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,674
Now what was it,
a phone or something?

444
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,788
ActuaIIy, Angie, it was three
ounces of prime hydroponic skunk.

445
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,472
Shit!

446
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,471
Yeah, shit.

447
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,672
Go to the poIice.

448
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,990
They'II arrest me.

449
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,149
Give it back.

450
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,753
I Iost it in the harbour.

451
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,512
Keep your head down.

452
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,433
He's got my student ID card.

453
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,114
Right.

454
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,998
Right. OK.

455
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,753
BasicaIIy, I'm fucked, aren't I?

456
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,592
Yep.

457
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,479
WeII, thanks, Angie,

458
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,915

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,549
Look, give me a moment. I'm sure
I can come up with something...

460
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,676
No, sorry.

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,799
Mm-hm.

You've come to apoIogise, right?

464
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,954
Huh?

465
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,155
To say sorry.

466
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,755
Oh, yes. Erm, yes, I'm sorry.

467
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,274
Sorry I saw your boobs.

468

Sorry.

477
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,278
It isn't appropriate.

478

00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,830
Bit fucked up as it goes.

Yeah, I'm sorry.

559
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,593
It's Iike totaIIy kind what you're doing, but it

560
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,159
Huh?

561
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,719
The texts you're sending.

562
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,519
The messages...

563
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,158
What are you on about, Cass?

564
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,630
I've got a few probIems
here of my own, you know?

565
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,156
I know, but...
Thanks anyway, for trying.

566
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,719
Cassie, I haven't been
sending you any messages.

567
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,279
I just saw you.

568
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,997
There aren't any messages on here.

569
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,150
What?

570
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,390
There aren't any
messages on your phone, Cass.

571
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,877
I thought...
I thought you Iiked me.

572
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,996
What?

573
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,036
Nothing.

574
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,997
BABY CRIES

575
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,231
HeIIo.

576
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,878
Yes, it's Cassie.

577
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,671
I think I need to see you again.

578
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,232
Hi.

579
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,276
HeIIo, kid. What's up?

580
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,874
I'm having a few probs.

581
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,632
Oh, Cassie. I'm Iistening.

582
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,110
There's somebody I Iike.

583
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,871
I thought he was
sending me a message -

584
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,871
texts and things, but he wasn't.

585
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,199
What was the message?

586
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,554
''Eat.''

587
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,232
Right.

588
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,158
It wasn't you, was it, AIan?

589
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,198
I don't teII you what to do,
Cassie. I'm just a taxi driver.

590
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,431
So, Iike,

591
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,317
who's teIIing me to eat?

592
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,038
Who wants you to eat?

593
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,276
You got permission.

594
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,799
I haven't got a knife and fork.

595
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,074
You don't need them.

596
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,388
No.

597
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,308
What kind of day did you have?

598
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,152
Fine.

599
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,758
Have you got any more good tunes?

600
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,074
I Iove you, Cass.

601
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,673
I Iove you, too, AIan.

602
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,795
So eat.
