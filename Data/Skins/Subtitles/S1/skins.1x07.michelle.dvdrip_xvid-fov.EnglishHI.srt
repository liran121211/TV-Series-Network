You dirty fucker! I never want to
see your tiny, twatty cock ever again.

Hey, hey, come on, Chelle.

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,312
I was waiting for you tell me.
Time's up, you wanker!

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,630
Jesus, what have you done this time?

7
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,711
- Sid?
- I dunno.

Oh, Christ's sake!

"Never mind"?

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,191
Did he screw someone again?

16
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,473
Again?

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,917
I tried to tell you, Chelle.

About who?

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,919

- About who, for Christ's sakes?!

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,878

Abigail Stock?

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,513
He promised he hadn't.
Why didn't you tell me?

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,477
You're supposed to be my friend.

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,269
Chelle, I tried. I didn't wanna...

27

It's just Tony, right?

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,839
Did <i>you</i> do him?

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,876
What? Don't be so stupid, Michelle.

30
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,713
I bet you wanted to fuck him.

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,119

That's what friends are for, yeah (?)

I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.
He just... It was nothing.

Why are you being so horrible?

144
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,271
- Why do you care?
- I do care,

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,750

So come on, make it snappy.

- I dumped Tony.
- Oh, right. What for?

147
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,670
He went down on a boy in my history class
while I was watching.

148
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,714
Right. Well, you know,
say you're sorry or something. I don't know.

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,238

A psychology teacher can do that?

157
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,997
Yes, she can. But look,
we gotta keep it under wraps, yeah?

158
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,718
Hmm. Yeah.

159
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,074

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,752
It's like a fucking episode of The OC.

00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,831

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,718

- I asked you to write that?

179
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,554
Yeah.

180
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,314
"Power is the single most important force
in the universe.

181
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,996
"Money and looks mean nothing
except for the power they give us.

182
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,598
"The second most important is sex.
So sex plus power equals fun."

183
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,590
Whatever you did
that Michelle's too upset to talk about,

184
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,875
I hope you're ashamed of yourself.

185
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,638
It was all my fault.

186
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,788
I got off with Tony on the Russia trip.

187
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,996
ALL GASP

188
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,072
I only did it because I fell out with Anwar
when he said he hated gays,

189
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,790
so I got upset, and Tony said he'd give me head,
to cheer me up, you know,

190
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,633
and I didn't mean anything, but I lost my head

191
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,429
and then he gave me head,
and then we got deported from Russia.

192
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,717
And I'm really, really sorry
for being a slut, OK?

193
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,395
Right, well...

194
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,278
Anyone else wanna get something
off their chest?

195
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,229
- I'm in love with...
- Sit down!

196
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,314
Hi, Abi.

197
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,318
Michelle. How, uh, safe to see you.

198
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,958
Isn't it?

199
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,270
- Can I ask you something?
- Yah?

200
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,875
OK. I was just wondering
how many times you fucked my boyfriend.

201
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,030
Oh, Abi, you didn't!

202
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,839
Very, very rude of you, yah? It's just horrid!

203
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,592
Don't worry, he fucks everyone...

204
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,910
including boys, so you've got that in common.

205
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,992
- Oh, you absolute bitch!
- Hey, hey, hey! Easy, Abi, easy.

206
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,117
God, I didn't! I mean, I just wouldn't.

207
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,394
That's terrible.

208
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,995
I wouldn't go there, mate.
Don't know what she's picked up.

209
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,594
- Know what I mean?
- It's the absolute limit!

210
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,515
Let go of me! I want to shit her,
the fucking bitch-cow-whore!

211
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,434
Perhaps you should go.
I'm Josh, by the way, Abigail's brother.

212
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,078
Sweet.

213
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,230
OK, well, bye, girls.

214
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,118
Bye, Abi.
<i>Three little maids from school are</i> we...

215
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,794
Let me go! I want to tear her tits off!

216
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,509
- Let go of me!
- Wow!

217
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,716
Come here, you curly-haired tart!

218
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,233
I'm gonna fuck you up!

219
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,920
Come back! Come back!

220
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,198
<i>So say good night</i>

221
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,149
<i>To the fallen truth</i>

222
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:18,157
<i>Say good night to the anger</i>

223
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,152
<i>Say good night to the stars</i>

224
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,119
<i>That are following you</i>

225
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,670
<i>And say good night to the moon.</i>

226
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,834
How long are you gonna keep this up for?

227
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,110
You know what? I never realised
how fucking knackering it is to know you, Tone.

228
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,714
- It's fun, though.
- You think?

229
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,278
Anyway, what do you want?

230
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,510
You know what? Tell me you love me.

231
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,631
You know I love you, Nips.

232
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,439
No! Tell me like you'd die for me,

233
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,638
like nothing else matters,
like your world stops turning because of me.

234
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,110
Like you mean it, you little shit. Go on.

235
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,997
I mean, come on.

236
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,233
Wrong answer, Tony.

237
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,833
Fuck off. I'm busy.

238
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,839
<i>In my head it was cloudy all over</i>

239
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,595
<i>In my eye I could picture this guy</i>

240
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,753
<i>With a tear tattoo under one eye...</i>

241
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,992
'Hi, this is Cass. Don't bother leaving
a message because I'm not listening.'

242
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,229
BEEP

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,399

DOORBELL RINGS

246
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,233
DOORBELL AGAIN

247
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,879
Hi.

248
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,679
Hi.

249
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,193
You love me, right?

250
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,077
You really love me.

251
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,912
Yeah...

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,797
How much?

253
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,674
A lot.

254
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,752
- That'll do.
- Wait. What are we?

255
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,512
It's now, Sid.

256
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,033
It's now, OK?

257
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,955
- You go.
- No, you.

258
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,074
- You.
- Why not you?

259
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,033
Michelle...

260
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,394
Michelle... My glasses.

261
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,232
Um...

262
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,754
are we gonna practise safe sex?

263
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,877
All in good time.

264
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,111
Stand by for <i>lift-</i> off.

265
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,633
ZIP SLIDES

266
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,915
Sid?

267
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,515
I think I can honestly say that
that has never happened before.

268
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,953
Bugger.

269
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,035
Come on, grab my tits.

270
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,599
Grab them!

271
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,553
Yeah?

272
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,595
I dunno, Chelle.

273
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,318
- I'll take it off.
- Michelle...

274
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,992
It's got a funny clip.

275
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,991
Chelle!

276
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,392
I've dreamt of this twice a night
for the past eight years, to be exact...

277
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,874
...and three times on birthdays.

278
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,678
Wow!

279
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,079
Was I good?

280
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,993
Oh, yeah, yeah.
But this feels funny, you know?

281
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,638
My tits feel funny?

282
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,712
No! No. You've got a lovely handful.

283
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,316
But the thing is, you're Michelle.

284
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,517
My friend Michelle.

285
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,794
Do you fancy someone else?

286
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,273
I think I do.

287
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,558
But we're OK, yeah?

288
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,996
Because this isn't right
when you're missing someone too.

289
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,272
Sid, have you got a razor I could borrow?

290
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,112
It's OK, Dad. Michelle's just a bit upset.

291
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,918
SHE SOBS

292
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,873
(Finally!)

293
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,270
Liz? ...Yeah.

294
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,954
Hey, listen. It's conclusive! He's not gay!

295
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,839
Should have rung,
but she doesn't answer. Let's go.

296
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,434
Just because you made someone
try to kill herself

297
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,033
doesn't mean she won't be glad to see you.

298
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,553
You reckon?

299
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,919
- That's it, we're going.
- For Christ's sake! Come on.

300
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,993
(Both) Wow!

301
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,835
(Sid) Jesus. What are they all doing?

302
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,435
They're trying to be happy, Sid.
It isn't easy.

303
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,795
(Sid) No.

304
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,596
Can you see her?

305
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,113
Let's mingle.

306
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,111
(Michelle) Just be inconspicuous.

307
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,155
BANG!

308
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,673
(Both) Whoa!

309
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,555
Cass...

310
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,515
Oh, wow. Hi. What a lovely surprise.

311
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,591
Hey, Cass.

312
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,079
How are you doing?

313
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,709
I'm so cool. But we're not supposed
to have visitors during happy time.

314
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,633
We won't be long.
Sid wants to say something.

315
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,278
Lovely.

316
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,793
I'll leave you to it, OK?

317
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,512
You want to stroke my pussy?

318
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,318
Um...

319
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,278
Isn't he lovely?

320
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,273
There were four, but they won't let
Gerard look <i>after</i> them any more.

321
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,279
Um, Cass...

322
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,511
I'm sorry you tried to kill yourself
because of me.

323
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,512
Oh, that's OK, Sid.

324
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,797
I realised something. I've been an idiot.

325
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,996
Yes.

326
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,073
And I was hoping maybe
you'd give me another chance?

327
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,676
Oh, wow, Sid!

328
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,718
Cool. You're so lovely. Wow!

329
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,074
Great.

330
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,596
- If I wasn't seeing Simon, that'd be amazing.
- Simon?

331
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,795
That's me.

332
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,873
- We've got so much in common.
- Depression, self-loathing.

333
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,713
He knows we can't have a physical thing,
I don't do that now.

334
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,792
- I'm still hoping you'll change your mind.
- I won't. So you see, it's all so exciting.

335
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,598
- Right.
- He wants me.

336
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,193
- I do.
- And he can never have me.

337
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,352
- I'm hopeful.
- It's just perfect. Isn't it?

338
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,152
I could get to like this.

339
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,472
I find it rather cool
for Kenya this time of year.

340
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,676
OK.

341
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,354
OK, Marjorie, ready?

342
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,750
Quite. Now, did you have a word
with the Prince of Wales?

343
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,308
He simply must stop coming in to my room.

344
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,269
He's a frightful cad and, well, I mean,
I'm old enough to be his mother.

345
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,759
Ha.

346
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,158
Hi.

347
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,798
Um, what are you doing here?

348
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,190
Er, visiting. What are you doing?

349
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,635
Working for my mum.
She kind of owns the place.

350
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,188
I think you might be breaking the rules.

351
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,919
Oh, leave the girl alone.
She's tremendous thighs

352
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,070
and deserves a little respect.

353
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,794
You're right, Marjorie. Take your time.

354
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,711
Thank you.

355
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,439
Listen...

356
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,830
Do you fancy a coffee maybe? Tomorrow?

357
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,036
Yeah. Nice.

358
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,157
Mud Dock, then. Tomorrow, about midday?

359
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,673
OK.

360
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,354
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

361
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,796
Would you have a word
with the quartermaster?

362
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,714
I like my antelope preferably
fairly well cooked.

363
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,950
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

364
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,195
Hello?

365
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,832
What the fuck?

366
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,315
They've sent me too many
fucking Bongo Dongo Dogs.

367
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,709
You know Mum meets clients
here on a Tuesday?

368
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,519
So? And I've only got two Gerry Giraffes.

369
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,875
Why are you such a wanker, Malcolm?

370
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,029
Eh?

371
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,078
I know you're using her.
Spending her money on your fuck-ups.

372
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,549
I can only assume
you've got a huge cock,

373
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,870
because there's no other reason
she'd waste her time on a tit like you.

374
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,995
DOOR OPENS

375
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,115
< Hi, I'm back...

376
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,952
< What the fuck?

377
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,513
Um, what the fuck are these?

378
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,036
That's Bongo Dongo Dog,
and this is Gerry Giraffe.

379
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,554
Hey, babe.

380
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,108
I have got clients coming round
in eight minutes

381
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,318
to buy into my unique vision
of modern furnishings and fabrics.

382
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,312
I thought that we could put
a few of them about

383
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,436
and maybe your clients could buy 'em.

384
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,433
You think my clients would decorate
their homes with these?

385
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,433
Sure they would, babe.
Look at the little expression on his face.

386
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,078
Ah, love it. Ain't they lovely?

387
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,516
- Get these fucking fucking fuckers...
- They're 17.99 each...

388
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,114
...out of my fucking house!

389
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,590
ORNAMENT SMASHES

390
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,148
(Malcolm) You bitch.
You keep your hands off my stuff.

391
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,595
(Mum) Tosser. Keep your crap
out of my house!

392
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,309
(Malcolm) There's nowhere else to put it.
And keep your stupid daughter out of my face.

393
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,960
- (Mum) They were so right about you.
- (Malcolm) Oh, yeah? About what?

394
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,918
- (Mum) You're a useless, lazy tosser.
- (Malcolm) Fat old slapper.

395
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,955
(Mum) Fuck you!

396
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,749
(Malcolm) Fuck you right back,
right up your big, fat, lardy arse!

397
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,637
Goodbye, Malcolm.

398
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,188
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

399
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,748
Malcolm says you were rude to him.
You'll go and say you're sorry.

400
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,789
- No!
- Go and say you're sorry to my husband!

401
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,510
Right. Go on, then.

402
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,794
I'm sorry.

403
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,633
I should never have said you have a big cock.

404
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,154
I now realise I was mistaken.

405
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,518
That's not how it sounds, babe.

406
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,431
I know. Because you do, don't you?

407
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,192
What?

408
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,316
Have an unfeasibly large cock.

409
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,396
Yep.

410
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,950
Well, get it out, Bongo Dongo Boy,
cos I'm ready to make up.

411
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,189
(Michelle) She does my head in.
He's my third stepdad in seven years.

412
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,748
Twenty-fucking-seven years old.

413
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,310
Jesus, I mean, that's disgusting,
right? That's, that's...

414
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,516
I dunno. It's better
she's got someone, isn't it?

415
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,589
You think?

416
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,069
God, yeah.
Mother hasn't been laid in ten years.

417
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,991
Probably why she's off her trolley.

418
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,069
She's what?

419
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,276
She's completely nuts.

420
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,839
Psychotic basket case.

421
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,436
- And she's a...
- Child psychiatrist.

422
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,635
- It's nice.
- What?

423
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,199
Having someone to talk to.

424
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,559
- My last boyfriend never really spoke to me.
- How's that?

425
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,437
It's hard to explain.

426
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,911
Everything Tony says, you can't work out
whether it's a joke or an insult or...

427
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,275
I dunno.

428
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,635
Sounds like he wore you out.

429
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,149
Yeah.

430
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,629
You really know how
to get me talking, don't you?

431
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,712
Son of a psychiatrist.
Get it every sodding day.

432
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,119
Your mother analyses you?

433
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,633
And the rest.

434
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,716
I'm unstable with neurotic
obsessive tendencies. I take them.

435
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,997
It keeps her happy,
and keeps me happy too, actually.

436
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,069
God. You're very upfront.

437
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,832
What other way is there to be?

438
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,229
Josh... do you wanna get out of here?

439
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,554
Where to?

440
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,200
A few drinks... I dunno.

441
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,275
Let's go.

442
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,118
Fuck the drinks. Let's go to my place.

443
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,274
<i>One is a gun</i>
<i>with a dart for my sweetheart</i>

444
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,798
<i>Two, only you</i>

445
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,314
<i>Can remove such an ache, so</i>

446
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,435
<i>Three</i>

447
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,514
<i>Let me see what you've got</i>
<i>What you're made of, what you're not...</i>

448
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,672
Hi, Tony. You're looking so, so fit.

449
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,637
Fit as fuck, yah? Yah?

450
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,438
Hi, Abi.

451
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,513
I heard you dumped that chav girl.
That's so safe. Slut.

452
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,151
We just weren't on
the same level intellectually.

453
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,639
Not like you and me, eh, Abi?

454
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,994
I am rather brainy.

455
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,274
Yes.

456
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,557
Which was why I was thinking
you might be just the right person

457
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,631
to help with my photographic project.

458
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,199
It's a study of the human form.

459
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,032
In-depth, focus study.

460
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,839
Well, that sounds jolly interesting, Tony.

461
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,717
When were you thinking of starting?

462
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,836
Because I'm completely free right now.

463
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,359
Cool. My place?

464
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,839
Safe.

465
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,838
You're lovely.

466
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,319
Am I?

467
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,197
Yeah.

468
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,032
You're clever,

469
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,270
funny, and...

470
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,793
very, very pretty.

471
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,113
Do you think one of my tits
is bigger than the other?

472
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,872
What?

473
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,393
Is one...

474
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,834
Never mind.

475
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,793
Never mind.

476
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,116
You really have to take those things?

477
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,031
Yeah, afraid so. Done it for so long.

478
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,395
Mother used to serve them up with breakfast.

479
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,152
I get a bit wobbly otherwise.

480
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,071
I can't believe that.

481
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,151
You should try without.

482
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,639
No.

483
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,280
Um, you wouldn't like me so much.

484
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,839
I think I would.

485
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,512

486
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,874
Who's that?

487
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,439
I thought everybody was out.

488
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,831
(Malcolm) Cheers, mate.

489
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,672
I'll get the rest.

490
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,475
Malcolm?

491
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,355
I thought you was at college today.

492
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,718
You know, of all my mum's marriages,
I think this has been the shortest.

493
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,635
I don't have to explain this to you.

494
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,597
No, you don't.

495
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,432
Tell her I'm sorry.

496
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,632
I just couldn't hack it, you know?

497
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,472
Yeah, I know.

498
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,473
Something to remember me by.

499
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,150
Careless.

500
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,593
Goodbye, Malcolm.

501
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,793

00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,633
"A madman's mercy
bade thee run away."

529
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,117
SOBS

530
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,872
CRYING ON PHONE

531
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,030
What? Who?

532
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,477
(Michelle) 'Josh.
He sent me pictures of Abigail.

533
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,950
'She's... She's got her tits out for him!

534
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,678
'Why did he do that?'

535
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,714
Who's? Who's Josh?

536
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,392
Chelle!

537
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,392
'Oh, God! He warned me.

538
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,675
'He's fucking crazy.

539
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,354
'I feel so weird!'

540
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,715
Ah, babes.

541
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,030
You'll be OK.

542
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,320
WOMAN CRYING

543
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,512
I'm fine. I'm fine...

544
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,556
I fucked it all up again!

545
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,079
I'm too loud. Too impatient. Too clever.

546
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,789
You know, what I always forget is,
because I'm happy, you know,

547
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,793
because I'm just being me,
I can't help it if I'm a funny old cow

548
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,838
with a loud mouth and a big bum!

549
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,831
Your bum's not that big.

550
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,069
You know, I never felt tired around him.

551
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,996
I felt good, really good,
and now he's gone, the fucking twat!

552
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,959
And I know he loves me,
he's just a scaredy cat.

553
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,833
I'm sorry, Mum.

554
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,233
You know, I really,
really loved having sex with him!

555
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,957
INAUDIBLE

556
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,755
Hi.

557
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,035
Hi.

558
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,309
I'm so sorry, Chelle.

559
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,634
Come on. Let me see.

560
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,433
Jesus, I didn't know you could get
your legs into that position!

561
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,638
He warned me.
He told me his family were screwy.

562
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,472
Told me he was, too.

563
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,111
Well, that's pretty screwy!
Taking beaver shots of your own sister?!

564
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,440
Delete them.

565
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,476
Has he tried to ring you?

566
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,516
About a thousand times.

567
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,828
Don't.

568
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,354
Don't worry.

569
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,873
Drink?

570
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,115
Yeah.

571
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,713
Malcolm.

572
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,114
How are you doing?

573
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,111
Not so clever, as it goes.

574
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,111
Why's that, then, wanker?

575
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,230
I just...

576
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,880
miss the big mouth and the big bum.

577
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,635
She's my mum, Malcolm.
Watch your lip!

578
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,872
I always blow it, all right?

579
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,038
I get jumpy.

580
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,148
I just... I wish I could, like, fucking just...

581
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,593
I'm a wanker.

582
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,115
I'm a wanker.

583
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,918
Does she miss me?

584
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,113
No.

585
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,830
All right. She fucking misses you.

586
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,310
But you let her down, Malcolm,
that can't happen again.

587
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,914
So decide.

588
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,434
Stay here or get your coat.

589
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,875
Don't you fucking dare go back on it!

590
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,916
Let's go.

591
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,592
I'm staying out here.

592
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,113
Spruce up, man!

593
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,199
OK?

594
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,033
- OK.
- OK.

595
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,113
You're a proper girl, yeah?

596
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,952
Yeah.

597
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,513
Hello, Nips.

598
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,678
I heard about Pervy Boy.

599
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,230
He really needs to learn
how to use a phone. "Send To All".

600
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,514
You gotta be careful with that.

601
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,715
Yeah. You're probably right, Tone.

602
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,232
- So...
- So?

603
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,554
Can we stop this now?

604
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,393
- And?
- Get back to normal.

605
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,870
Stuff happens. You get over it.

606
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,234
- Yeah, but...
- Yeah, but.

607
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,072
Yeah, but.

608
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,879
- Chelle, you got nasty.
- Yeah.

609
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,350
What are you doing here?

610
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,434
I came because
it turns out that, as it goes...

611
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,432
...I think I might love you.

612
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,912
That's an awfully long sentence, Tony.

613
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,433
Well, yeah, but...

614
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,278
Yeah.

615
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,111
Chelle!

616
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,913
I said it, OK?

617
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,669
I'm sorry.

618
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,109
I'm sorry.

619
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,994
Beg.

620
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,671
Sorry?

621
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,478
You heard me, Tone.

622
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,992
OK.

623
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,310
Look, please can we get back?

624
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,915
I won't do any of it again.
The cheating and lying...

625
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,390
Undermining. Sneering.
Taunting. Manipulating.

626
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,513
OK. Yeah. All of those things.

627
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,838
I promise.

628
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,477
So?

629
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,673
So I'll see you around.
