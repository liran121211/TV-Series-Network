1
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,835
Blessed are those who can give

2
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,630
without remembering, and
take without forgetting.

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,153
Amen.

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,593
Amen.

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,072
Thanks, Effy, but you know this is
the best birthday present I could have.

6
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,072
A nice family meal.

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,515
A chance to have a bit of quality time.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,909
Ah, isn't that lovely?

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,234
Ha, you know, this reminds me of
when I was a boy and my Auntie Mabel,

10
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,673
when she was carving the chicken,

11
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,719
she always used to wear
these loose-fitting tops...

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,756
Yes, I think we've all
heard this one, haven't we?

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,149
It's a joke, Anthea, an anecdote.

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,836
And my dad, your grandfather,
God rest his soul,

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,639
"What would you like,
David?" She used to say,

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,676
and he'd look right
down her front and say,

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,719
"I'd like breast, please, and then
maybe a bit of leg and stuffing."

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,952
I mean, he'd basically growl at
her. You see, that's a difficult dad.

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,716
- No-one thinks you're difficult, Jim.
- Ha! And then Mabel would get to me.

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,472
Ah, what could I ask for?

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,588
I scoured my brain and came up
with, "Thigh, please, Mabel."

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,673
I basically asked for the only thing
I could think of that was non-sexual.

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,672
- Thigh!
- Thighs can be sexy.

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,038
That's not true.

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,759
You'd be surprised, you can
do a lot with thighs, Dad.

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,274
No, you can't.

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,553
Look, I'm sorry. What
is so sexy about thighs?

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,949
I mean, what on earth
can you do with a thigh?

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,474
Please not... Not in front of Effy, Jim.

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,713
All right. What would everyone like?

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,233
A bit of thigh, please, Dad.

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,519
No! Not yet! Did I say do it yet?

33
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,034
No, look, Jim! Effy's rolled a five.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,591
Oh, yes, well, er,
right, well, jolly good.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,716
All right, we'll treat
that as your go, Effy.

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,069
Er, so you got a five... Oh, God,
I can't understand these rules.

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,833
They've translated them from Korean.

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,797
Jim, maybe we shouldn't play a game.

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,314
Fine. Fucking fine.

40
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,078
Fucking, fucking fine.

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,639
So what shall we do, then?

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,199
Just sit, shall we?

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,115
Yes, we can just sit, yeah, and
I'll see if I can find some nice...

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,633
biscuits, ok?

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,229
Oh, I hate it when
your mother's like this.

46
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,917
- Help me!
- What's wrong?

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,752
Any luck with it?

48
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,193
Never mind.

49
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,759
Good night, love.

50
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,831
Night, sweetheart.

51
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,948
There's nothing there. What's wrong?

52
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,436
'Tony. You all right,
man? How's it going? '

53
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,238
What's everyone doing tonight?

54
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,914
'Um, well, there's a few
people coming round to mine.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,754
'But it's a homework thing, really.'

56
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,273
Is Michelle coming?

57
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,830
'Yeah. Yeah, but it's for
a class that you're not in...

58
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,353
'Um...

59
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,192
'Er... biology...

60
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,998
'You're not in it.'

61
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,833
It's fine, Chris. I'm
not invited, right?

62
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,639
'I just... I don't think you'd
enjoy it, really. You know? '

63
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,358
Yeah. I know.

64
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,279
'I'm asleep or just too bored to
speak to you, so leave a message.'

65
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,477
Is this now officially silent
treatment you're giving me?

66
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,632
Michelle broke up with me, remember?

67
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,554
Still, if you think this is gonna
piss me off, then you're wrong.

68
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,870
I actually quite like it.

69
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,919
I'm just gonna keep on filling up your
voicemail with all sorts of shit...

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,752
I'm never neurotic.

71
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,276
Dads always check up on their
baby girls, that's what we do.

72
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,148
Look, she's asleep.
Come on, let's go to bed.

73
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,196
Bed? But it's early.

74
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,713
Panorama.

75
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,828
I don't think that I've given
you my birthday present yet.

76
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,388
- Auntie Mabel?
- Mmm.

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,869
Actually, she was a neighbour,
not a real blood relative.

78
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,633
I know exactly what she was.

79
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,191
I'll fetch the turkey baster
and you... wash your bits.

80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,830
'I dunno. I'm probably not even going.

81
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,353
'You're breaking up, Tony.'

82
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,838
'She doesn't want to see
you, Tony. Leave us alone.'

83
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,316
I wasn't sure what to wear.

84
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,749
Can you believe I borrowed
this top from my mum?

85
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,753
Though Davey, when I wore my mum's
fishnets to the school disco thing,

86
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,229
said that was well rough cos
women used to wear fishnets

87
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,754
without knickers at orgies or whatever,

88
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,354
so, like, my mum would
have got stuff on it.

89
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,035
Davey calls it lady juice. Can you
believe he called it lady juice?

90
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,317
And he says by wearing the tights,
her stuff would have rubbed off on me.

91
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,594
Though I wore knickers,

92
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,389
and I don't think my
mum went to many orgies.

93
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,914
I mean, she grew up in Luton.

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,958
I don't think many
orgies happen in Luton.

95
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,870
Don't! He's gross!

96
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,636
I'm a bit scared. Are you scared, Effy?

97
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,154
I keep tasting sick in my mouth.

98
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,234
I think it's cos I'm excited and
nervous. Do you ever get that?

99
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,630
Tasting sick in your mouth, like
you've got hiccups but you haven't.

100
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,676
Do you ever get that, Effy?

101
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,478
Do you?

102
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,711
Did I tell you about
Davey trying to finger me?

103
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,118
Effy! You came!

104
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,159
I mean, cool, I mean...
I wasn't sure you would.

105
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,955
Hi.

106
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,476
It's my last day and they're
fucking wankers to work for.

107
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,269
So you know, break, take, steal...

108
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,955
Anarchy and all that. Mad.

109
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,670
So this is it? Really?

110
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,912
Oh, this is Spencer. A mate of mine.

111
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,278
Hi, I'm Julie and this is
Effy. Do people call you Spence?

112
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,952
No. They don't.

113
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,190
I've heard a lot about you,
Effy. Not all of it good.

114
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,510
You heard anything about me?

115
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,830
Wanna ride?

116
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,678
Shall I get on too?

117
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,716
We're here together!

118
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,873
- Big Issue!
- Bit late for you, isn't it, Kenny?

119
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,757
Last week's edition.

120
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,308
Drunks are usually
too generous to notice.

121
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,674
Who you out with?

122
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,274
On my own tonight. Listen,
you don't fancy a beer?

123
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,079
Sorry, beer's not really my drink.

124
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,948
Now, once you've tasted a Pinot
Grigio, hops just lose their allure.

125
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,156
Right, ok.

126
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,752
Do you want a hand... selling?

127
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,229
Where's all your mates, then, Tone?

128
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,197
Fallen on hard times, have you?

129
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,794
Something like that.

130
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,519
Well, no offence, but the
sooner I get these sold,

131
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,875
the sooner I can get home to
the missus for cocoa and cuddles.

132
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,829
And I'm not going to get much sold
standing next to a posh lad, am I?

133
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,593
Right. Ok. No worries.

134
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,874
See you later.

135
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,188
Ta-ta.

136
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,273
Big Issue, fella?

137
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,036
It's the fucking cops!

138
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,675
Do you think they'll
give us a joint cell?

139
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,635
Hello.

140
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,358
'This is Police Sergeant Bill Hughes.

141
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,032
'Am I speaking to Tony Stonem? '

142
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,519
What?

143
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,637
Clifton Branch police station.
Marjorie Watts. How may I help you?

144
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,917
- Um...
- Sorry, I rushed it. I'll go again.

145
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,433
Clifton Branch police station.

146
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,476
Marjorie Watts. How can I help you?

147
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,914
Hi, Marjorie. I'm here to pick up
Elizabeth Stonem. She's been arrested.

148
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,991
Okey-dokey. I'll check that for you.

149
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,356
Just missed her. Her brother's
picked her up already.

150
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,032
- I'm her brother.
- Her other brother.

151
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,075
I'm her only brother.

152
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,199
Ok, her boyfriend pretending to be
her brother's picked her up already.

153
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,113
She just left with a fat lad.

154
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,510
Ladies, your carriage
awaits. Come on, chop-chop.

155
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,034
Effy! Eff...

156
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,755
That was fun.

157
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,637
Unexpected, but fun.

158
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,917
- So fucking hard to keep a straight face.
- You did well for a fat fuck.

159
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,434
You're so lucky, Effy.
I can't believe it.

160
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,035
Remember when I tried to get arrested
for kissing that police officer?

161
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,759
Normally I would have been with her.

162
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,752
We're always getting into trouble
together at school. Tell them...

163
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,558
Does she ever stop?

164
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,834
Anyone want some?

165
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,955
What is it?

166
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,794
We're known as the cheeky girls.

167
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,077
Not that we're Romanian or,
you know, show off our pants!

168
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,394
'Hi, this is Effy's phone.
She's currently cruising

169
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,756
'at 35,000 feet and there's
definitely turbulence ahead.'

170
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,718
What? It's, uh... Tony.

171
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,553
Effy? What's going on?

172
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,115
Look, oi! Can we get some
concentration here, please?

173
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,556
I know it seems hard,
right, but think about it.

174
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,031
This
- this could lead to, you know, celebrity.

175
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,476
A place in the Guinness Book
Of Records is hardly celebrity.

176
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,994
But it is! Right, I
fucking love that book!

177
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,638
Will you stop eating the tools?

178
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,316
It's not my fault you decided
to go for sugar cube pyramids.

179
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,436
Oh, hi.

180
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,270
What's this... some
kind of retro LSD thing?

181
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,397
Oh, no. It's kinda that homework
thing I was telling you about...

182
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,677
The, er... biology.

183
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,838
Hi, Michelle.

184
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,953
Hello, Tony.

185
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,635
Look, don't worry, I'm not gonna
stay. I just needed Sid for a minute.

186
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,395
- I'm busy.
- Yeah, I can see that, Sid.

187
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,351
Go on.

188
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,795
Let's have a go, then.

189
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,077
Ah...

190
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,479
Ah...

191
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,153
Fucking hell, guys, you know how
to have a good time, don't you?

192
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,549
I don't want this to be difficult.

193
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,914
If you want to stay, you can stay.

194
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,790
No, it's fine. You made the divorce
terms clear and I intend to stick to them.

195
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,359
Please don't be a bastard.

196
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,351
Look, don't get so upset about it, ok?

197
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,309
I'm sorry I spoilt your
beautiful evening. I'll go. Sid?

198
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,315
Well, go on, then.

199
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,231
Go see what he wants.

200
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,231
Don't feel you have to, Sid.

201
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,755
I'm gonna go.

202
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,752
But only to tell him to leave, right?

203
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,113
You should leave, Tony.
No-one wants you here.

204
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,189
Shit!

205
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,919
You ok?

206
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,037
I tried ringing, but you haven't
answered your phone all week.

207
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,998
- Did you get beaten up?
- Effy's missing. We need to look for her.

208
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,038
Effy? Is this another one of your games?

209
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,918
Yeah, Sid, it's a game.

210
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,196
'Hi, this is Effy's phone.
She's currently cruising

211
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,794
'at 35,000 feet and there's
definitely turbulence ahead.'

212
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,438
This sounds a bit weird, Tony.

213
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,273
It's fine. We'll nick your
dad's car, drive around a bit,

214
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,351
spot her, take her home,
we can go for a pint.

215
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,629
Shit!

216
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,789
What?

217
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,915
It's Cassie.

218
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,039
- She was there.
- So where's she gone?

219
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,159
Flown off on her broomstick?
She's still in the loony bin.

220
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,958
No, she was there.

221
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,998
Maybe she's haunting you, cos she
tried to kill herself because of you.

222
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,273
Hang on. You want to nick my dad's car?

223
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,790
Why can't we nick your dad's instead?

224
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,919
Because, Sid, my dad has central
locking, a sophisticated alarm system

225
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,468
and probably thinks a spell
in prison would do me good.

226
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,950
Whereas your dad has a 20-year-old
car, Neighbourhood Watch

227
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,519
and won't prosecute.

228
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,358
I bet you ten quid I know
who you're thinking about.

229
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,557
There's times I think me and
Tony are gonna get back together.

230
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,108
And just like that, I'm ten quid richer.

231
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,633
There's a sort of thing,
though, isn't there? First loves?

232
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,472
You think Tony loves you?

233
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,309
No, I don't.

234
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,358
Sorry, that sounded far
less harsh in my head.

235
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,078
Don't worry about it.

236
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,354
Michelle.

237
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,310
Wait up. Listen, I'm off to a late-nighter at
the sports club. Fancy coming? A quick drink?

238
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,277
- Can you not take a hint?
- Come on.

239
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,238
You must have worked out
by now that I didn't do it.

240
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,995
You had porno pictures of
your sister on your phone.

241
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,559
How fucked up are you?

242
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,076
- Someone set me up!
- Yeah, right, Josh.

243
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,355
Look, the party'll be a laugh.

244
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,672
Michelle! Please!

245
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,913
Fuck it. Go.

246
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,353
Good decision.

247
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,556
Fucked-up is an understatement.

248
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,952
He's got nice wheels,
though... for a nutter.

249
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,995
Shut up!

250
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,472
- Home!
- This place is fucking brilliant.

251
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,028
It's like Wonkaland.

252
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,395
This is where the rich kids come to die.

253
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,271
Welcome to my world.

254
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,116
I feel a bit rough!

255
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,670
Kevin, I think you should
take Julie to the bathroom.

256
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,432
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

257
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,358
Finally, we're alone.

258
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,714
Not quite.

259
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,068
Jesus Christ.

260
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,072
Fuck! I wondered when
you were going to turn up.

261
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,596
Hello, Effy. I'm Jesus Christ.

262
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,989
Anything?

263
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,149
Nothing.

264
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,117
Bollocks!

265
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,558
You know, she may be having a bit
of fun, a joke at your expense.

266
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,154
That's not her style.

267
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,151
No, I know Effy.

268
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,276
She's cleverer than this.

269
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,476
In fact, she's the cleverest
fucking person I know.

270
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,074
I don't know anyone like her.

271
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,037
Cass?

272
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,755
Look, I'm worried about her.

273
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,991
I just... Even if we're looking
in the same places twice...

274
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,752
- Cassie, she was...
- Please, Sid?

275
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,673
Ok.

276
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,192
- Effy?
- 'Hey, Tone.

277
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,669
'You've gotta come to this
party down at Cumberland Basin.

278
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,591
'We're flying the virgin highway.'

279
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,990
- Who is this?
- 'Effy says hi.'

280
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,196
What? Put Effy on the phone!

281
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,077
Hello?

282
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,957
Fuck! Come on, Sid.

283
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,749
Looks a bit... spooky.

284
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,637
You're not still afraid of the dark?

285
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,472
You still sleep with that
night light on, don't you?

286
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,599
It's not a night light. It's a
glow-in-the-dark Batman. It's retro.

287
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,877
Effy!

288
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,713
Effy! Effy! Effy!

289
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,155
Effy! Eff... y!

290
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,950
No, I don't think she's here.

291
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,793
- Doesn't look like much of a party, does it?
- No.

292
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,037
Effy! Effy!

293
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,479
Only if you want some.

294
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,868
Course she fucking wants it.

295
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,234
There we go.

296
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,357
Dr. Stock's marvellous medicine.

297
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,157
Sometimes I think I was
born backwards, you know?

298
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,276
Come out of my mum the wrong way.

299
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,353
I hear words go past me backwards.

300
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,079
The people I should love I hate.

301
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,390
And the people I hate...

302
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,759
Ow! Fuck!

303
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,277
All the help I've ever given you, and
you've been fucking useless tonight.

304
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,554
I've been good.

305
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,710
You've been useless. You're
always fucking useless.

306
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,997
Take Michelle. I worked
fucking hard to create

307
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,674
a shagging opportunity for
you. Then you went pussy.

308
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,715
No...

309
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,438
Instead, she ends up with this Josh,

310
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,479
a complete fucking knob, who I have
to sort, so that's your fault, too.

311
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,199
Sort? What did you do?

312
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,317
Put naked pictures of
Abigail on his phone.

313
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,756
Made sure Michelle could see them.
Made sure everyone could see them.

314
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,512
It was quite funny.

315
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,194
Funny? That's sick.

316
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,633
His sister. Why did you do that?

317
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,355
You know what, Tony?

318
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,318
Sometimes I don't know
why we're friends any more.

319
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,992
It's weird, isn't it?

320
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,957
I'm from Mars, you're from Venus.

321
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,349
I do things, you worry about them.

322
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,750
I sleep with girls, you
persuade them to attempt suicide.

323
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,398
Don't.

324
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,636
Are you bunching your fists at me, Sid?

325
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,996
If you wanna hit me, go right ahead.

326
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,033
Ow!

327
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,757
I said a punch, not a bitch slap!

328
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,399
I can't believe you slapped
me! That's hilarious!

329
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,474
Sid, you'd better not be crying.

330
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,391
I'm not crying cos you punched me.

331
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,994
You're crying for the kids in Africa?

332
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,469
You know I used to so
look up to you, don't you?

333
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,675
Of course I did!

334
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,433
You were at home every night
wanking your brains out.

335
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,192
"Someday I'll be like Tony.

336
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,077
"Someday I'll be like Tony."

337
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,391
And now I can think of
nothing worse than being you!

338
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,559
You've always been selfish,
I always understood that.

339
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,758
You did things because you wanted
something... fine. Makes sense.

340
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,512
But now,

341
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,273
now you do things because you can!

342
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,749
You fuck with people...

343
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,674
and I don't get why.

344
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,154
You've got no friends, no
girlfriend, only your parents left.

345
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,994
Not even Effy is answering your calls.

346
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,593
You're right,

347
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,238
she is clever.

348
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,636
Every time you talk, Sid,

349
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,235
little flecks of spit are
coming out of your mouth

350
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,151
and they're going on my face.

351
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,152
Sid? Sid! Don't be a little girl.

352
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,434
What? Ef?

353
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,392
Who the fuck is doing this?!

354
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,837
Sid. Sid! How the hell am
I going to get out of here?

355
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,631
You're one of them, aren't you?

356
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,193
'Hi, this is Cass.

357
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,590
'Don't bother leaving a message
because I'm not listening.'

358
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,636
I know you're there, Cassie.

359
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,429
I mean, I think I know you're there.

360
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,556
I mean, I want you to be there.

361
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,270
I'm at Rocatillo's.

362
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,828
I want to speak to you,

363
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,751
and I think you want to speak to me.

364
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,350
I didn't have to answer, Tony.

365
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,871
I'm grateful that you did.

366
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,918
- 'Ok.'
- Ok.

367
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,080
'So how come you called me? '

368
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,276
I dunno.

369
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,757
I'll tell you why you rang.

370
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,876
It's because you miss me.

371
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,793
It's because I'm the only
person you can really talk to.

372
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,396
Yeah, Michelle. That's
right, this is all about you.

373
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,277
'Well, isn't it? '

374
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,635
Not tonight. No.

375
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,636
Are you ok, Tony?

376
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,435
No.

377
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,919
What's the matter?

378
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,197
'Effy's missing. Sid's meant to
help me find her but he's fucked off.

379
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,352
'Now I'm at some posh wanker
night at the Ston Eaton sports club

380
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,873
'and I don't know what to do.'

381
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,520
This is the weirdest
fucking night of my life.

382
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,591
What do you want me to do, Tony?

383
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,478
'Nothing.

384
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,993
'I gotta go.'

385
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,557
You know it's, like, two
in the morning, don't you?

386
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,995
You're the one that's been
following me round all night.

387
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,474
You've got a black eye
growing, did you know that?

388
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,758
- Tony punched me.
- Wow! Really? That's excellent.

389
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,193
Is it?

390
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,352
We did a course on it at the
centre... separation anxiety.

391
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,714
He's worried he's losing you.

392
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,313
Well, I just did leave him.

393
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,834
I mean, literally. And then I...

394
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,873
I wanted to see you.

395
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,239
Do you want to kiss me, Sid?

396
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,998
Ok. So this is where you lean in.

397
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,517
Cool.

398
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,192
Yeah.

399
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,556
I'm sorry, I'm usually
better than that. It's...

400
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,789
No, it was lovely.

401
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,395
No, my rhythm was out and my
teeth, they kept getting in the way.

402
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,550
Could I... try again?

403
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,191
Only if you don't ask.

404
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,638
Who is it?

405
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,518
Um, kind of weirdly, Michelle.

406
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,670
Answer it.

407
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,473
Sid? I'm worried about Tony.

408
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,198
'Tony? Don't worry about him.'

409
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,590
I just spoke to him. He
sounded strange, in a real mess.

410
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,830
Michelle, can I ring you back?

411
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,469
He's at some Ston Eaton sports place.

412
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,994
- Where?
- 'Ston Eaton. Something weird's going on.'

413
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,672
I'm in the middle of something.

414
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,751
'You know the sports club? '

415
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,354
The place Josh and his mates hang out.

416
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,635
Please, Sid. Just check he's ok?

417
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,199
Josh?

418
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,271
'Yeah.'

419
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,079
Ok. I'm leaving now.

420
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,073
It's Tony. He's in trouble.

421
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,151
Tony.

422
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,596
- Oh.
- I'm really sorry. I've got to go.

423
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,830
Do you?

424
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,393
Kiss me again.

425
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,637
No, Sid. I won't.

426
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,155
Effy?

427
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,673
Effy?

428
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,915
Wahey!

429
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,190
- Ok, I'll see your 50 and I'll raise you...
- Raise or fold, man.

430
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,396
- Don't waste my time.
- I'll see you.

431
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,789
Tony. Hi.

432
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,235
Fancy some poker? Five-card stud.

433
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,229
I'm looking for my sister.

434
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,833
Oh. She's over there.

435
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,428
Effy.

436
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,317
Shit. Effy! Hello...

437
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,277
Effy, Effy. What happened?!

438
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,590
Effy, Effy. What happened?

439
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,150
Someone call an
ambulance. Effy. Oh, fuck!

440
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,675
Hello? Yeah?

441
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,557
My sis... Ambulance.

442
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,279
- 'How can I help? '
- My sister's overdosed, I think.

443
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,918
'Can you tell me where you are? '

444
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,877
Where are we? Where the
fuck? Oi, where are we?

445
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,349
I'll give them directions.

446
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,396
What the fuck are you doing?

447
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,789
Ok, let's make a deal.

448
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,394
We'll call an ambulance as
soon as you fuck your sister.

449
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,993
Three from the top, please, mate.

450
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,479
You're joking!

451
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:12,148
Well, factually it's true. So, um...
no, not a joke. More a funny fact.

452
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,913
Get out of my fucking way!

453
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,231
Don't worry, it's not her first time.

454
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,356
You won't be taking her
virginity. Right, Spence?

455
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,829
She's my sister, you sick fuck!

456
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,559
You put porno pictures
of my sister on my phone

457
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,790
and I make you fuck your sister!

458
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,113
Is this about Michelle? You really
think Michelle is worth this?

459
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,990
I'm so sorry I can't get one
up, I can't... I keep going soft!

460
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,435
Please. Whatever I did,
I'm sorry. I promise,

461
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,354
I'll get you back with Michelle.
I'll do anything, I promise!

462
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,633
Effy.

463
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,350
Josh, mate. Josh.

464
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,795
Shut the fuck up, Spence.
I want you to fuck her.

465
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,029
No, you can't mean that!

466
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,473
- Do you want me to play with it a bit?
- I can't.

467
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,118
- Help you out?
- I really can't.

468
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,474
Then you're a shit brother.

469
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,790
- She's dying over there, Tony!
- I promise...

470
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,518
You'd better get hard!

471
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,989
Please... Please...

472
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,354
Beg me.

473
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,911
I beg you. I beg you, I beg you...

474
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,560
Please...

475
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,191
Well, you only needed to
ask. Here endeth the lesson.

476
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,748
Tony? What's happened?

477
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,796
What the fuck's happened to her?

478
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,313
It's all my fault.

479
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,713
Ok. It's ok. Let's just
get her to a hospital, ok?

480
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,918
* I don't know why I
couldn't feel before

481
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,830
* Faith in a world I
can't believe in any more

482
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,718
* I'm tired of being here

483
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,236
* I'm tired of being wrong

484
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,709
* The universe keeps turning

485
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,758
* Where do I belong?

486
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,474
* You don't remember me

487
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,676
* But I remember you

488
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,232
* I lie awake, trying
not to think of you

489
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,749
* The way I let you down

490
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,070
* The way I did you wrong

491
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,270
* The universe keeps turning

492
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,920
* Where do I belong?

493
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,349
Do you think she can hear us?

494
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,159
I don't know, darling.

495
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,800
Effy, love?

496
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,438
Her hands are cold.

497
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,351
Well, maybe best let her sleep.

498
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,839
She can hear you, Dad.

499
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,911
That's enough from you.

500
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,715
Doctor...

501
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,153
Sorry, is she?

502
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,155
Oh. It's all looking fine. It's
good, yes. I'd go as far as great.

503
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,755
These kids are remarkably
resilient creatures, you know?

504
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,913
It's all gone, and whatever
hasn't will be out in a few days.

505
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,673
One way or the other.

506
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,276
She took some very clean,
pure pharmaceuticals.

507
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,598
Right, ok. I'll leave you be.

508
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,951
So I suppose we should congratulate
you for getting her clean drugs.

509
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,793
You think this was me?

510
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,757
She was with you!

511
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,831
I wasn't, I was...

512
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,148
Don't deny it!

513
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,073
Tony, she's your little sister!

514
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,832
I know.

515
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,148
I know.

516
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,117
But, listen... for a second...

517
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,398
No. I've had enough of
listening to you. We all have!

518
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,508
You and your horrid little ways,
always at other people's expense.

519
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,036
Hang on. That's enough.

520
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,792
What?

521
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,348
He loves Effy.

522
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,032
Don't you think this is hard enough?

523
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,917
And who the fuck are you?

524
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,150
I'm his best friend!

525
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,071
And I'm his fucking father!

526
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,878
I know what you are.

527
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,670
Come on, Tony. We're going.

528
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,273
I wanna stay with Effy.

529
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,793
Come on, mate.

530
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,672
Ah! Fuck!

531
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,352
Thank you, Sid.

532
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,557
It's ok. They're free.

533
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,996
No, I mean really, thank you.

534
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,638
Yeah, I know what you mean, Tony.

535
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,909
- She's gonna be ok.
- Yeah.

536
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,115
I'm sorry.

537
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,633
Ok.

538
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,113
Thing is...

539
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,395
I know I can be a wanker sometimes...

540
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,678
but everyone likes that, don't they?

541
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,958
Ball-busting, turning
heads wherever I go.

542
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,358
People like that.

543
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,911
- And I like people liking that.
- We don't have to do this now.

544
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,833
But then...

545
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,754
I start to feel... distorted because...

546
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,398
because I'm more than that.

547
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,232
I don't wanna be a wanker.

548
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,993
I don't, Sid.

549
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,674
Effy knows that.

550
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,671
She loves me for who I really am.

551
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,992
God, I sound like fucking Lionel Richie.

552
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,639
I quite like Lionel Richie.

553
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,151
All I know is,

554
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,549
when I was scared tonight,

555
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,189
and I was a bit... a lot...

556
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,713
I wanted you there.

557
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,990
Effy's different. I sort of own her
cos she's my sister, but with you...

558
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,791
I just really wanted you there.

559
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,431
And then you were in the car.

560
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,036
The thing is, Tony,

561
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,758
you sort of own me, too.

562
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,958
Mostly in a good way.

563
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,233
Come on, I'm taking you for breakfast.

564
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,513
You do know it's 4am, don't you?

565
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,750
Yeah, I know.

566
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,991
Do you reckon we'll find us
anywhere that'll do us a curry?

567
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,036
I've got a real craving for curry.
