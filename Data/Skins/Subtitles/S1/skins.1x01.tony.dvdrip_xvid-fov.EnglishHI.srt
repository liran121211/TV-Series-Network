it's not that much to ask, Nips.

Sid's almost 17. He's gotta get laid

he can't be my friend, obviously.

- Sorry, Jal. Wrong call. Can you hold?

- No.

In her confused state, she comes to
believe, however momentarily,

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,073
- Who's the lucky girl, then?
- I think you're gonna like this.

177
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,231
Oh, yes. You are a very,
very lucky little boy.

178
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,119
Michelle?

179
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,668
I'm gonna do it with Michelle?

180
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,752
- Hang on, Sid.
- I'm gonna dock the ferry with Michelle.

181
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,355
Cheers, Tony. You don't know what...

182
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,477
Hi.

183
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,120
...what this means.

184
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,237
Are we getting me laid or shall I just start
filming and take it back for private time?

185
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,436
All right. Who's stupid enough
to fuck Sid?

186
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,475
Cassie.

187
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,039
She's still in hospital.

188
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,476
They let her out. She's just
not allowed to handle knives.

189
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,999
All right. She'll do.

190
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,877
We're gonna need a lot of drugs.

191
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,076
Get an ounce.
We can sell it at the party.

192
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,310
I've got to get an ounce of spliff?

193
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,518
There's this guy who'll sell on tick.
Tell him we'll pay tomorrow.

194
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,953
But why don't you go?

195
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,077
Got tai chi, then my choir audition,
then psychology.

196
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,196
Cassie's great in the sack.

197
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,111
As long as she's not hungry.

198
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,235

199
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,912
(Both) Everyone.

200
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,835
OK, fuck it. What's this guy's name?

201
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,589
It's all on there.

202
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,355
That's this guy's name?
Mad Twatter?

203
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,591
Is that waking up your chi,
Karate Kid?

You shouldn't have got it out, Chris.

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,429
No. Do you think he'll be long?

332
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,670
Not once I burst in all
flummoxed up, he won't.

333
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,070
No, I meant the guy I came to see.

334
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,115
Mad?

335
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,636
Mad. Is that... Is that his real name?

336
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,914
Oh, yeah.

I'll come back later.

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,200
It's fine. Just don't stare.
He doesn't like people staring.

340
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,269
Right.

341
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,874
He's sensitive, you know.

342
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,599
Just don't stare at it.

343
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,238

344
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,117

don't buy the dope. Nobody's coming.

No, not at all.

Um, so you're a doctor, then?

364
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,235

00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,949
Well, the Ph... D thing.

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,716

You could say, um, pretty... huge...

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,635

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,549

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,073
Huh? How did you?

379
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,479
I mean.

380
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,998

Show me some money.

385
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,550
Right, well. That's the thing.

386
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,510
Cos someone said that maybe
I could get the stuff, and pay, like...

387
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,832
...later?

388
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,070
- Woah.
- Oh, fuck!

389
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,948

fucking shark attack there, right?

390
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,157
I quite understand.
Let's just forget...

391
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,153
No, fuck it. It's your game,

392
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,390
Do you wanna play?

393
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,154
Yeah, yeah... Yeah.

394
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,479
Um, how about an ounce of spliff?

395
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,834
Three ounces it is.

396
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,948
No, no, an <i>ounce...</i> of... spliff.

397
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,315
Three ounces.

398
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,313
That's three hundred pounds

399
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,356

400
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,594

Yeah.

404
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,070
I'm just checking, because

405
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,071
your balls are your collateral.

406
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,352

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,556

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,439
In this phase, the feelings of low self-esteem
and hopelessness are common.

413
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,718
But these will finally give way, eventually,
to the final phase of acceptance...

414
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,552
WEEPING CONTINUES

415
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,791
...an understanding that what
has been lost can never return,

416
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,189
and that life can continue
although it may be very different.

466
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,593
Yup. It's Abigail's party. And we've
got to sell an ounce of dope.

467
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,477
I was meaning to talk to you...

468
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,758
So we tell them it's like,
Mongolian Hallucinogenic or something.

they might just buy it.

- Tony!

- Hey.

472
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,589
Where is everyone?

473
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,719
Not coming. And Sid has to sell
or he's in shit with his dealer.

474
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,028
Hang on. "My dealer"?

475
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,669
Anyway, I brought Cassie.
Cassie, you remember Sid, right?

476
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,880
Yeah, wow, lovely... No.
But I like that you're funny-looking.

477
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,077
That's cute - like, wow, man.

478
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,118
- How's the treatment going, Cassie?
- Oh, it's cool.

479
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,273
I wear a white dress
and now I can eat yoghurt,

480
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,954

481
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,918

484
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,754
Well, that's encouraging.

485
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,991
Oh, thank you. You're so nice.

486
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,991
Cass, Cass, Cass! Sid's going
to be looking <i>after</i> you tonight.

487
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,117
Oh, would you? Wow!

488
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,997
And Sid's got a whole bag of drugs.

489
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,559
Wow!

490
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,234
That's so nice.

491
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,754
And I bet you won't even
make me eat anything.

492
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,070
No. No.

493
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,196
Thank you.

494
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,350
Right, great! Let's go in
and <i>shift</i> this ounce, then, yeah?

495
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,716
It's three ounces.

496
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,074
I got three ounces.

497
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,759
Hi, Abi.

498
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,832
Tony! Lovely.

499
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,558
And these must be your frands.

500
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,595
Sorry?

501
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,353
Yeah, this is Michelle,
Cassie and Sid.

502
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,589
Super.

503
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,477
Wow, you're lovely.

504
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,629
Super.

505
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,439
Where's the kitchen?
I want to see the kitchen.

506
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,239
It's through there. Come in.

507
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,753
Cheers.

508
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,231
Oh... shoes.

509
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,357
It's just that Mummy had this carpet
imported from Iran.

510
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,351
We have to be so,
so careful with the pile.

511
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,715
Right, yep, sure.

512
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,949
Sorry.

513
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,473
(Tony) No problem.

514
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,197
Can I get you some rum punch?

515
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,477
I'm afraid we're getting rather
giggly on it - isn't that safe!

516
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,757
Mmm, we love rum punch,
don't we, Chelle?

517
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,077
Super.

518
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,310

- What was your name again?
- Sid.

521
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,668
Sid? Is that Polish or something?

522
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,910
No, I don't think so.

523
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,831
Danuta's Polish. Danuta.

524
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,111
She doesn't speak English.

525
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,192
But you can just speak to her
in Italian or in French.

526
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,999
She likes you.

527
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,957
Oh. Cheers.

00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,831
Abi, I wonder if you and your friends
would like a little something?

00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,319
Something?

Oh, ya, that would

- The "hice"?

534
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,557
Yes, because the silk wallpaper's just
arrived from Rome, and Mummy's particular

mustn't, or she'll go wild.

Oh, no. You mustn't eat it.

properly at all.

Cool.

Pardon?

562
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,510
You know. Like Michelle said.

563
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,795
She said that?

564
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,199
Oh, yes.

565
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,875
Look, I've got all this fucking weed.

No.

00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,998
I can't.

569
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,991
It makes you hungry.

570
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,152
- Well, I don't mind.
- I do.

571
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,359
Sorry.

I'm sorry, guys. I just wanted
to show you my world, you know.

I'm definitely not turning gay.

- Well, just have to imagine that.
- Hey, where you going?

588
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,839
To find that party.

589
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,674

She told you?

Oh, fuck.

631
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,994
She said that Tony
doesn't love her properly, but you do,

she totally loves him even though

639
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,792
if everything's so fucked up, and you...

00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,156

651
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,195

652
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,474
What kind of pills?

653
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,028
Oh, you know.

654
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,510

- Who's got skins?
- Er, me. Hang on.

00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,991
Don't say you haven't got them.

704
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,197
Stop worrying. We've had
all our bad luck for today.

705
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,838
You put them in your back pocket.

706
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,672
- When?
- Come here.

707
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,958
Hang on.
There. Yeah, I got them.

708
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,474
(Michelle) Tony! Tony, do something!

709
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,515
Tony!

710
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,034
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

711
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,595
Oh, my God!

712
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,312
Tony!

713
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,110
I think that could have gone
a lot worse, don't you?

714
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,515
The dope's gone.

715
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,160
At least we've got our health.

716
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,878
That's the important thing.

717
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,513
<i>Chicken feet scratch out a beat</i>

718
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,229
<i>While head rolls on the ground</i>

719
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,039
<i>Lookin' for a piece of meat</i>

720
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,715
<i>And sleep in eiderdown</i>

721
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,190
<i>I walked a million miles</i>

722
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,478
<i>I crawled a million more...</i>

723
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,994
For God's sakes,

724
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,230
what are you doing, Miriam?

725
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,390
Why do you have to get up so early?

726
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,152
Just getting ready.

727
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,552
Anybody would think you wanted
the neighbours to see you.

728
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,153
Do you hear me, woman?

729
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,429
Yes, darling.

730
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,632
Tony.

731
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,914
Yes, Sid.

732
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,037
Chris and that Polish girl.

733
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,918
They got out of the car
at the hospital, right?

734
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,390
I mean, they got out
before the harbour, yeah?

735
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,595
Yeah.

736
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,997
Yeah.

737
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,752
Yeah.

738
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,317
You still a virgin, then?

739
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,473
Yup.
