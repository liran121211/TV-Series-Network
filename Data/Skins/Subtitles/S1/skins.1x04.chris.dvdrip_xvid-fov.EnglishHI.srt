How much is there?

20
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,476
One thousand smackers.

21
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,835
I'd put it in premium bonds.

22
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,471
See, it's low risk, with
a steady return. And it's tax free.

23
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,312
You sure you didn't just forget?

24
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,799
Forget what?

25
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,314
She said she's going on holiday,
you said "Yeah",

26
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,356
dropped a few pills
and forgot about it?

27
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,590
I dunno. It says
she's gone for a few days.

28
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,159
Is it true?!

29
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,108

CHEERING AND WHISTLING

45
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,397
He's had an erection for 15 hours?

46
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,835
Doesn't even know
how many Viagras he popped.

47
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,070
He's holding it down with Sellotape.

48
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,229
Sellotape?

49
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,475
Yeah. I don't know how.

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,233
But he's Sellotaped it to his belly,
or his balls...

51
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,550
I don't know,
Sellotaped it to something.

52
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,718
All right?

53
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,273
- So it hasn't held then.
- Must be the sweat.

54
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,989
See, I reckon life's about
living in the moment,

55
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,437
you know... finding,
you know, happiness, pleasure.

56
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,033
You know?

57
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,557
Whoa. Steady.

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,755
I'm not going to lie to you,

59
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,916
I'm in love with someone else.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,877
But why should I love you?

61
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,030
We don't know each other at all...

62
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,593
And I've got this physical need thing,

63
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,274
and I was hoping...

64
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,874
maybe you have too.

65
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,313
SHE RETCHES

66
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,032
You look for the gummy bits,
yeah, through the paper.

67
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,078
Lick it.

68
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,798
And then...

69
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,314
Bruv, what papers are you using?

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,153
Cos I heard TCI Whites...

71
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,152
No. No, man.
They're satisfying, yeah,

72
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,879
but the density's off,
and there's too much cellulose.

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,758
I thought - maybe I'm wrong -

74
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,400
we should get to know each other first.

75
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,079
I'll...

76
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,354
...call you tomorrow.

77
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,510
What's your...

78
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,273
What's your number?

79
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,509
Sid.

THUD

81
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,916
Chris, this feels like
speed dating for druggies.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,513
I don't know no-one here, man.

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,435
Yeah, man, I know. I'd say I know
maybe about 20% of the people here,

84
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,317
that's why it's so good.

85
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,709
Actually, man, maybe more like 10%.

86
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,315
I see you invited your psychology
teacher to aid this interaction?

87
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,038
Angie's here?

88
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,270
Yeah.

89
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,838
I could <i>shift</i> a few ounces
of this stuff.

90
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,997
If you've got a decent supplier.

91
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,233
Chris... I'm sorry. Chris?

SONG STOPS

93
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,633
You all right? Do you want to dance?

94
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,110
No, I, um...
Are there any other teachers here?

95
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,756
I dunno. Yeah, maybe.

96
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,356
It depends if they knew about it,
and if they wanted to come.

97
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,555
Or if...

98
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,271
No, I only invited you.

99
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,955
This was a bad idea.
I didn't think it through.

100
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,350
- I just wanted you to come.
- Chris...

101
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,638
I think, right, that dancing is,
like, the best thing in the world.

102
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,792
Yeah? Because it makes you healthy,
in your body,

103
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,270
but it also,
it makes your head better too, so...

104
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,038
I just... Will you stay and...

105
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,878
...dance or just...

106
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,633
Please.

107
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,675
OK.

108
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,193
Yeah?

109
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,554
Yeah.

110
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,358
<i>This was the place where you</i>
<i>let me love you first</i>

111
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,078
<i>We danced to Van Morrison</i>

112
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,720
<i>And shut out the world</i>

113
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,869
<i>I know that</i> it...

114
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,598
Ahh.

115
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,716
I... I can't do this.

116
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,472
What? Why?

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,956
No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

118
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,476
Angie, Angie, look, look,
it's not like that, all right?

119
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,710
I dropped a couple
of them Viagra by mistake

120
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,518
and it's been like that all day.

121
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,989
It's been like a second leg,
fucking third leg.

122
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,196
It's... It's just Viagra!

123
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,790
(Man) You see? That's Viagra for you.

124
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,715
- More trouble than it's worth.
- Speak for yourself, Casa-never.

125
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,431
<i>...Now that you're gone</i>

126
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,509
<i>It's just the...</i>

127
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,716
<i>And me.</i>

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,149
MUFFLED MUSIC AND SHOUTING

129
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,312
I think she's a fucking nut
leaving a grand on her sideboard.

130
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,428
I liked her. She smiled too much
and everything but she was all right.

131
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,556
I swear Chris gives
these bastards speed.

132
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,234
They move faster
than normal fish do.

133
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,078
Besides, I don't know what it would
be like having a son like Chris.

134
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,434
Ugh.

135
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,353
He's all right.
He can be well sweet sometimes.

136
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,873
Mmm.

137
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,433
Tony?

138
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,272
Yeah, yeah, just a minute.

139
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,839
HE TAPS

140
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,836
You know what I like
about your body?

141
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,596
No.

142
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,989
One boob's bigger than the other.

143
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,708
Oh. Fuck.

144
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,074
Hi, Sid.

145
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,676
Sorry. I was just, uh,
looking for a T-shirt.

146
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,196
It's just Chris
said I could borrow a... Fuck.

147
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:06,435
Sorry, it's just someone puked on me,
I just need a T-shirt.

148
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,431
I'll choose you one.

149
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,751
I'll wait outside. Sorry.
Fuck, sorry.

150
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,239
Sid.

151
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,433
What do you think of my tits?

152
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,078
Huh?

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,991
Um...

154
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,358
- Is one bigger than the other?
- What? I don't...

155
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,793
What would you prefer?

156
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,590
I don't... I think there's
something wrong with my eyes.

157
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,238
Blurring, or...

158
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,550
I could have an infection or something.

159
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,237
You'll look good in this.

160
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,390
Thanks. Sorry.

161
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,029
They're, um, nice, Michelle.

162
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,313
Sorry.

163
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,155
That was brilliant.

164
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,435
Fuck off!

165
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,988
You know what, Tony? Your eyes
are supposed to fucking blur too.

166
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,316
Sid's face, though.

167
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,150
ENGINE WHINES

168
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,710
- You OK, Chris?
- Um. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,633
- All the others asleep?
- Yeah.

170
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,951
I don't really sleep well
in other people's houses.

171
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,272
- Do you want me to walk you home?
- It's miles. But thanks.

172
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,679
Right.

173
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,676
Yeah. How did that, um, music
competition thing go, by the way?

174
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,070
- Did you win?
- No.

175
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,391
Still, finalist, though -
that's got to be all right, ain't it?

176
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,715
What did the winner get?

177
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,433
Oh, he signed an international
recording contract.

178
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,116
- Cool. What did you get?
- I got £25 to cover my travel.

179
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,673
Wankers.

180
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,596
- Chris, where's your mum?
- Dunno, mate.

181
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,317
SNORING

182
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,399
I mean,

183
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,835
what was I supposed to say?

184
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,434
"Yeah, I like your tits.

185
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,035
"They seem very nice, symmetrical."

186
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,111
- What's the right word, even?
- Nice is OK.

187
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,310
Do you think she'll be upset?

188
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,834
Do you think she'll be angry with me?

189
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,195
I just,

190
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,475
you know, just...

191
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,237
- Your stiffy's digging into my back.
- Oh. Sorry.

192
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,235
- Sid.
- Yeah.

193
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,074
You know there are other girls,
don't you?

194
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,593
Where?

195
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,428
So you don't think
she'll be angry with me?

196
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,873
Safe.

197
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,630
110, 115, 120.

198
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,871
Um, it's all right, mate,
I've got change.

199
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,678
COINS JANGLE

200
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,394
121, 22.

201
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,278
<i>23,</i> 23.50.

202
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,749
24.

203
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,114
Six, eight.

204
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,998
Seven, eight, nine, ten. 24.20.

205
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,274
How much do I still owe you, mate?

206
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,749
14 quid.

207
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,151
OK, um, my mum keeps money upstairs.

208
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,435
I'll just go get it.
Wait there, one minute.

209
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,115
(Tony) What have you been doing, man?

210
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,997
(Sid) Nothing.

211
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,513
(Tony) You stink of sick.

212
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,556
(Sid) Yeah, but not, like, badly.

213
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,632
(Tony) If Chris's house
didn't out-stink you, yeah,

214
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,551
people would actually
be walking away from you.

215
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,108
Well, I'll just borrow some deodorant.

216
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,032
Hey up.

217
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,151
You all right, Chris?

218
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,195
Yeah.

219
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,313
What were you doing in the wardrobe?

220
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,995
I was just, um, checking what stuff
my mum took with her.

221
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,752
What did she take?

222
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,796
Oh, yeah. Everything.

223
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,794
Do you think she's gone, mate?

224
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,030
Hey, my knob's gone down, though.

225
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,554
- That's good.
- It isn't blue or anything?

226
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,156
Um, no, it's a bit red, like,
but, no, it's not bad. Not bad.

227
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,992
It looks bigger to me.
Probably did it some good.

228
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,878
Yeah. Yeah.
You might be right, actually. Yeah.

229
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,314
Hey, seven years bad luck,
that there, mate, the mirror.

230
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,913
(TV) 'And breathe in deep. Deep.

231
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,116
'And stretch and bend

232
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,953
'and stretch and reach.

'And reach to the right.

<i>'Left,</i> and bend.'

235
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,677
I think she's quite sexy.

236
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,955
I've always wanted
to fuck an older woman.

237
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,678
It's the hips...

238
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,271
...just above the knickers.

239
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,914
It's the way the skin bunches, you know.

240
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,077
I mean, look at her,

241
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,991
very nice hips.

242
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,675
Where's Chris?

243
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,478
Right here.

244
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,199
This man won't let us start
the pizzas till you pay him.

245
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,078
OK. Anyone got any cash?

246
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,354
You've got a grand!

247
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,309
Nah, man. I've got a nice hi-fi,
about 4,000 beer cans,

248
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,234
and then a few of these empty wraps.
What?

249
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,076
Listen, yeah, right, OK...
£1,000 ain't even that much money

250
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,197
these days, really, you know,
when you think about it. So...

251
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,117
Look, man, all right,
I bought it yesterday, yeah,

252
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,799
and I remember you, because you've
got a very good face for memorising.

253
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,758
I bought it from you,
and you were chuffed to sell it.

254
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,511
There's a Pop Tart in the CD drawer.

255
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,678
Clean it. I'll pay for that bit.

256
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,910
- So, you know, sell it on.
- We can't sell it on.

257
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,752
- Yeah, so if you clean it?
- We're not going to clean it.

258
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,311
- I will and bring it back tomorrow.
- It's soiled, it's unsellable.

259
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,630
Whatever you do to it now,
we can't take it back.

260
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,554
I'll clean it, bring it back tomorrow
and give it to one of the other people.

261
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,393
No, you won't. I will have
told them not to take it back,

262
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,913
because you've wrecked it.

263
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,999
I kept the receipt.

264
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,514
Receipts don't cover Pop Tarts.

265
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,633
I'll tell you how to
get rid of your zits.

266
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,948
Oh...

267
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,837
How?

268
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,070
Right.

269
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,994
Piss on toilet paper and wipe your face.
Works better than Clearasil.

270
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,513
Tried it.

271
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,994
Thank you for calling at Smithson Electrics.

272
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,957
Anything else I can help you with?

273
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,311
Er, no, er, just...

274
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,231
Chris...

275
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,710
Chris, wait up, mate, please.

276
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,870
Stop being a fucking pussy.

277
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,075
No.

278
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,354
What?

279
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,271
No.

280
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,669
You know, it says "we buy anything"

281
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,911
just there,
so maybe you could buy this.

282
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,151
Get out of my shop!
Get out of my shop!

283
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,675
- All right, Chris?
- Hey up.

284
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,239
Che! Che!

285
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,517
Loves watching me shit.

286
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,835
What can I do you for?

287
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,754
How did you get on
with that Lithuanian E?

288
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,549
I got some square pills
from Albania in.

289
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,279
Retro Eastern Blocs,
they're calling them.

290
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,669
Nah, um, I'm selling, actually.

291
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,830
Fancy a hi-fi?

292
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,751
Nah. Can't <i>shift</i> it, mate.

293
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,839
How about a wheelbarrow?

294
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,789
Oh, aye, I always need
another wheelbarrow.

295
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,233
£20 the lot.

296
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,515
Done. Cheers.

297
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,915
How d'you want it?
Powder, pills or cash?

298
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,433
Cash.

299
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,954
10, 15, 20.

300
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,473
Job done.

301
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,672
Fuck it, let's have a look at these pills.

302
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,153
Shit.

303
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,433
Fuck's sake!

304
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,673
See ya later, mate.

305
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,668
Fucking hell, man. You woke me up.

306
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,194
- Who are you?
- Who the fuck are you? I'm sleeping!

307
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,238
- This is my house!
- So?

308
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,357
Get off me, man!

309
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,032
Get off me! Ow!

310
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,793
Yeah!

311
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,916
Don't know what
you're fucking doing, thinking you can...

312
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,433
Leave it, man!

313
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,673
What the fuck?

314
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,834
Hey, buddy, hello?

315
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,877
You all right, me babba?
That was some ride.

316
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,838
Look, I think you should go.

317
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,992
No, not up the fucking stairs,
what you doing, man? Come on.

318
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,278
Let's create harmony.
I was only sleeping in your bath.

319
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,475
I've never met you, all right.

320
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,155
- You've met me now.
- Yes, but it's my house!

321
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,595
All right, so just fuck off!

322
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,432
Cheers, then.

323
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,839
Right, now let me back in.

324
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,072
You're a very hostile bloke.

325
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,754
Let! Me! Back! In!

326
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,958
You're a very aggressive young man.
I think you've got issues.

327
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,998
- Big issues.
- Ah, fuck!

328
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,598
You need to take a chill pill, mate.
You need to chill out.

329
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,319
- Let me back in.
- Listen, take a while. Calm down.

330
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,278
Maybe take a day or two,
and then we'll talk about it.

331
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,315
It's my fucking house!

332
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,279
I don't make the rules, man.
I don't make the rules.

333
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,911
So, um, what are you going to do?

334
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,275
Yeah.

335
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,475
There's only one thing you can't do,
Chris, and that's stay like you are.

336
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,189
You got no money,
basically no house, you can't just...

337
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,239
Look, I've fucked up, I know.
I fucked up.

338
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,191
No, you haven't.

339
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,755
- You just...
- Angie, do you reckon we...

340
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,037
Hey, Chris, trousers!
How good are we?

341
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,473
Don't tell him.

342
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,235
(Tony) Everyone's talking about some naked
guy who just walked through school.

343
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,710
(Sid) People are trying to work out whether
you've made a political statement.

344
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,552
- This top any good?
- I think you'll like it.

345
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,236
- I didn't think anyone would notice.
- Yeah. Maybe a few did.

346
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,558
Pull yourself together. Christ,
you need a mum, you big baby.

347
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,234
Tony!

348
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,915
Fucking hell, he's not pathetic.
You can take a joke, can't you?

349
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,279
Look, you try it, OK?
No Mum, no Dad, on your own.

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,956

- I've got... I've got a Dad.

352
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,473
There's no-one in.

353
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,790
You'll be fine, Chris, OK?

354
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,478
Chris?

355
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,357
Chris! What a...

356
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,159
What a lovely surprise!

357
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,472
- Look, we weren't planning on...
- Hi, I'm Jal.

358
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,235
Jal, I'm Mary.

359
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,629
Won't you come in?

360
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,996
Your dad'll be back soon. But
I can give him a ring anyway, shall I?

361
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,036
What, he's not here?
We could come back ano...

362
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,951
Wonderful!

363
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,473

And this is little Sammy.

367
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,071
Do you want to come
and say hello, Chris?

368
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,799
Er, no, I'll, um, leave him to sleep.

369
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,315
Well...

372
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,598
How's your mum, Chris?

373
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,878
- Actually, that's the reason...
- Yeah, she's getting better.

374
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,235
Oh, no!

375
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,754
She hasn't had another turn?

376
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,479
Um, no. Not really. She's fine.

377
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,952
Good. Well, send her my best.

378
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,631
Why don't we look for some baby photos
of Chris? That could be fun.

379
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,154
Graham labels them by year.

380
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,312
I'm trying to encourage him
to label by mood, but...

381
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,675
You won't find any of me.

382
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,469
Worried we might find
something embarrassing?

383
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,754
Ooh...

384
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,998
Ah, bingo!

385
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,954
Look, he's even sweeter than Sammy.

386
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,191
I don't think I'm supposed to
say that as a mum, but you are!

387
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,669
Have a look at him!

388
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,873
You do look quite cute.

389
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,315
That's not me.

390
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,719
It is.

391
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,756
No, it's not. It's Peter.

392
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,154
Oh.

393
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,800
Well, we can still say
he looks sweet, can't we?

394
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,916
Who's Peter?

395
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,231
- Um, he's my brother.
- Your brother?

You'll never guess who's here!

399
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,793
It's Chris! Isn't that great!

400
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,316
(Man) I need a shower.
I'm going for a shower.

401
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,712
(Woman) I've just had to sit with him
for the last half hour!

402
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,756
(Man) Well, get rid of him.

403
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,195
(Woman) Don't do this to me, Graham,
he's your son.

404
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,353
(Man) Can't help that.
He's a fuck-up, just like his mum.

405
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,194
I don't want him here, OK?
I'm taking a shower.

Everything's fine,
he's just got a couple of calls to make.

410
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,675
He's calmed down.
You look nice together, Chris.

411
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,879
Just wants to suckle
on something, probably.

412
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,914

- Listen. His mum has...
- Does he want money?

419
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,756
No. He doesn't.

420
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,515

HE FLICKS LIGHTER

423
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,549
I could never do them knots at Cubs,
you know, and they said,

424
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,791
"Ah, he's not got the fingers
for it," or whatever.

425
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,599
But look what
my fucking fingers can do now, eh?

426
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,318
Hey, do you... do you wanna hear about
the best day of my life?

427
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,630
Cubs.

428
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,109
I'd pissed myself by accident.

429
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,715
They'd had us sitting down
for ages and, um, I was trying...

430
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,998
trying to get out like to leave the room but this
kid kept blocking me,

431
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,516
stopping me leaving, he was playing
a game or something and, um...

432
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,273
So I told him, right,
that he was a dickhead,

433
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,432
and that he's gonna get out
of my way, dickhead...

434
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,237
...and then the whole place went quiet
cos I'd said "dickhead".

435
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,438
And then they was all laughing,
everyone, and I couldn't work out

436
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,956
if it was cos I'd swore or if
they'd seen that my shorts were wet,

437
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,271
so I tried to cover my shorts with
my hands, right, but that meant

438
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,989
they all definitely noticed
and then there was more laughing.

439
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,112
But, yeah, Peter,

440
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,270
my brother, he was, um,

441
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,113
he was youngest-ever
sixer or something.

442
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,033
They're the ones in charge, sixers.

443
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,873
Dib-dib-dib.

444
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,797
He could do all the knots, him.

445
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,391
Him and Dad would practise.

446
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,913
He loved it.

447
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,830
Anyway, he stands up, yeah, sixer,

448
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,151
and, um, and they all liked him,

449
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,832
and, um,

450
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,876
he takes my hand,

451
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,791
and took me to the toilet.

452
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,509
And then he had me take my shorts off,
and then he cleaned me up.

453
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,831
And then he took off
his shorts and put them on me.

454
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,752
And then...

455
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,308
he kissed me on the cheek,

456
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,038
and took my hand,

457
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,917
and we both went out there.

458
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,592
Him just in his pants.

459
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,193
No-one laughed.

460
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,273
Best day of my life.

461
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,638
Look, don't, um,
don't tell the others, yeah, about...

462
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,195
No, I won't.

463
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,309
Do you know what you're gonna do?

464
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,833
What, me?

465
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,195
No, I...

466
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,432
- You think your mum's gonna come back?
- Not if she's still around.

467
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,919
- How do you know?
- She <i>left</i> flowers by the grave again.

468
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,276
Every time you see a nipple,

469
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,148
a butt crack or a camel toe, you have
to drink one shot down in one, OK?

470
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,473
What's a camel toe?

471
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,388
Tony?

472
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,152
It's when it bunches around the...

473
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,874
...crack.

474
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,915
It's a minge thing.

475
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,399
< Oh. Nice.

476
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,471
You got slow play
on this thing, Michelle?

477
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,039
What? Slow play?

478
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,678
- There!
- Where?

479
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,513
A nipple, I saw a nipple.

480
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,675
Concealed or free?

481
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,591
If concealed counts
we're gonna be drinking a lot.

482
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,478
It can be concealed and visible.
Just ask Jal.

483
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,028
- What?
- When you're wearing that red top.

484
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,839
Will someone rewind the tape,
so we can all see the nipple

485
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,911
and drink, please?

486
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,636
Where's the controls?

487
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,748
- Sid.
- Oh, sorry, just gotta...

488
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,116
- You better not be going for a wank.
- Where's the fucking controls?

489
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,272
Gimme the remote.

490
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,109
- I think we should go on a date.
- What, us?

491
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,509
- We don't have to have...
- OK.

492
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,033
Er... yeah.

493
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,432
- That was a nipple!
- You know what? I don't fucking care.

494
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,839
There was a teacher in here last.
He might not have collected all his things.

495
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,276
If you find anything,
just put them in the corner, OK?

496
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,839
Yeah.

497
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,278
I... They told me

498
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,272
to tell you that
although this isn't a classroom

499
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,158
or anything, this is still college property.

500
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,151
So if you do any damage or...

501
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,277
Well, it will...

502
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,838
They could kick you out of school.

503
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,069
OK.

504
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,353
I'm sorry, it's just... They said to say.

505
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,998
No, it's OK, I don't mind.

506
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,192
I...

507
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,709
Your friends said you like fish.

508
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,917
And I wanted to give you

509
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,558
a room-warming.

510
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,517
That for me?

511
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,319
They didn't have any bowls
<i>left</i> in the store.

512
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,073
I just wanted to give you something.

513
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,198
Wish you luck.

514
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,633
Yeah.

515
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,993
Yeah.

516
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,673
I should go.

517
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,950
OK. Sorry.

518
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,076
Right.

519
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,639
Bye.
