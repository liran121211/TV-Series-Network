- Sorry. Slept in.

00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,076
Slept in? You miss prayers
with an excuse like that?

Dad, it's my birthday.

Aren't you going to say hello?

109
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,114

<i>32 cabs, not that you'd care.
It's a stupid fuss over a birthday party.

111
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,317
Does it give respect to God?
Does it promote peace?

112
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,358
- No, Dad.
- Does it help the poor? It's an affront.

113
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,273
So why do we have to do it anyway?
I don't even want a party.

114
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,115
Because I love that woman
more than these legs I drag myself along on,

115
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,397

00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,876
We don't see him these days.

119
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,552
We had a fight.

120
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,200
A fight? You fight with your friends?

121
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,157
Yeah.

122
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,913
What would you fight Maxxie about?
He's a good boy.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,991
Always well turned out,
respectful. The best type.

124
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,149
Never mind.

125
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,314
Whatever it is, forgive him
and don't be a bloody fool.

126
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,914
Now tell them I'm sleeping, huh?

127
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,153
- (Mum) Put down that food!
- (Child) Auntie, can I have one?

128
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,959
No, you can't! Get out of my kitchen!

129
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,271
Who's that boy?
All the time there's little boys.

130
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,032
Boys don't... Here he is!

Oh! He's got a moustache.
Little Anwar's got a moustache!

134
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,596
That ain't all Little Anwar's got.

135
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,553
Why aren't you saying hello

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,279
Sorry.

and they don't get a hello?

138
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,871
Hello, Uncle Muneer.

139
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,112
Anwar. So... <i>18</i> at last, huh?

140
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,872
No. No, I'm 17.

141
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,916
What?

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,353
He's 17?

143
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,590
Yeah. What's the problem?

144
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,959
You drag me here, all this way!
I paid money to drive on the M6. Money -

145
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,238
just to drive on a road
to come to a <i>17th</i> birthday party? Huh?!

146
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,594
Ahh! Got you!

147
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,629
- I had you going, didn't I? Didn't I?
- He is so funny, my brother!

148
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,314
(Mum) Why did you fall for that one?

149
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,277
(Every fucking year!)

150
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,915
L-O-L-L-I-P-O-P.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,513
Lollipop.

152
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,115
- You're just too good.
- Of course!

153
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,075
- When are your folks coming?
- Later. They've packed.

154
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,799
Hm. Bummer.

155
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,189
- You wanna get out of here?
- Huh?

156
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,759
Let's go out.

157
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,512
- We're not allowed.
- Come on. I want one last look.

158
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,068
What if we get hungry?

159
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,072
There's... there's food out there, you know.

160
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,434
Come on!

161
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,795
How?

162
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,598
It's easy.

163
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,310
We're just getting a breath of fresh air.

164
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,152
My friend thinks she want to puke.

165
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,832
Go. For fuck's sake, go!

Hello. Can I help?

171
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,948
Yes. Yes. I need to see someone.
It's very important.

172
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,270
There's something
I have to get off my chest

173
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,717
and if I don't, I'm afraid everything
might just totally go to shit.

174
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,153
Right.

175
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,994
I've got something going on
and I need to see someone.

176
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,036

205
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,835
But... No. She can see into <i>my</i> soul.

206

- 17.

220
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,116
It must mean something.

Tony really hurt me, Effy.

223

Why did he do that?

224
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,836
Sometimes I think you're the only person
in the whole world Tony truly cares about.

225
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,000
I thought maybe...
maybe he told <i>you</i> why he did that.

226
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,150
If I could trust him to tell the truth just once,

227
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,673
then maybe I could...

Hi. Enjoying your party?

351
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,794
Um... Do I know you?

352
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,434
I'm Seeta... friend of Atifa.

No.

361

I'm eating...

404
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,473
OK.

I never knew life could be so good!

406

It's OK. I don't think
he's dangerous... for the moment.

She's not here, mate. Run away again.

411
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,230
Well, I've gotta tell her something.

412
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,677
Do you understand me?
I've gotta find her. I...

413
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,032
I love her.

414
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,434
Oh...

415
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,476
well.

416
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,836
Then we'd better attend to that need
with due dispatch, my friend.

417
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,040
Tony, you're my best friend,

418
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,398
but I really don't know what the fuck
you're on about most of the time.

419
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,675
Do you think that matters?

420
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,514
Sidney, I think, on balance, it helps.

421
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,270
I reckon Anwar's party, yeah?

422
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,669
Yeah. That's it! Let's go, for fuck's sake!

423

Tone, this is my dad's car.

424
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,473
Yep. I went round to get your clothes.
Your dad was watching the football

425
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,155
and I reckoned we'd get here
a lot faster if I nicked it.

426
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,196
You stole my dad's car again?!

427
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,032
Yeah, but I've got Effy to worry about now.

428
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,396
I'm meant to keep an eye on her
now she's a drug fiend.

429
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,719
Better get changed, mate.
You don't get the girl wearing Bermuda shorts.

430
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,313
Fuck it. Drive!

It's a fucking stupid, messed-up world.

I've got my God. He speaks to me every day.

So I leave them be. OK?
