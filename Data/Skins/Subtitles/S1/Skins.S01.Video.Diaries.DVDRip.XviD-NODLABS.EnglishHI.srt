00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,195
Hello, year 2107!

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,589
I do hope you are all jolly well.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,355
My name is Abigail Stock.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,149
I've been chosen to make this video
and put a few things in this time capsule

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,199
to tell you all what life was like
in the year 2007.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,517
This is a copy of Handel's Messiah,
in which I sung alto at a concert last year.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,479
I'm putting this in because
whatever happens in the future,

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,358
I hope that there'll still be music,

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,715
because a world without music would be like...

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,268
a summer without Pimms.

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,351
Or games of pooh sticks.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,830
So if music gets wiped away
by global warming or something,

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,117
here's the answer.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,158
'This is a raspberry Juicy Tube.

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,429
'It's what everyone in the 21st century uses
to make their lips shiny and kissable.'

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,470
A boy I met the other day, Tony, horny as fuck,
told me he liked the taste.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,076
So I'm putting it in so that
you can all attract yummy boys.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,596
Oh, don't worry.
I've just bought ten more tubes.

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,554
'Since this box and video are going to be, like,
totally sealed,

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,835
'I thought I'd let you know that life in 2007

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,515
'is sometimes a bit fun and naughty as well.'

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,034
Yeah, you know, we like to have a smoke,

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,953
listen to grime on pirate radio.

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,600
This last one's a bit harder for me.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,750
I've had him since birth.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,833
But if one person deserves to go to the future...

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,474
...it's Rufus.

Goodbye, sweet Rufus.

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,318
OK, that's it from me.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,994
I hope you've learnt something about my time.

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,232
I wish you peace, love and prosperity.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,392

Oh.

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,269
Hello, ladies.

Wa gwan?

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,588
My name's Anwar and...

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,912
...as you can see, I'm into looking after my body.

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,799
No. But I ain't shallow.

44
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,199
It's not just about the looks and
the... fresh clothes and the loads of money.

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,748
No, there's more to Anwar Kharral than that.

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,434
I like poetry...

47
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,189
...flowers...

48
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,432

It wouldn't be right.

You're married to Ashley Cole right now.

I've gotta respect that.

I'll give you a bell sometime.

I'm so sorry about that.

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,432
Some people just... can't let go.

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,038
Anyway. I want a girl that can be my world,
my moon, my stars, my...

it'll be well cheap for me to come and visit you,

So this is my face.

This is my other face.

Wow!

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,753
I like boys on swings and girls on skateboards.

82
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,512
I like babies in high chairs.

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,114
I like pharmaceutical medicine wrappers.

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,998
I like people in hats with big eyebrows.

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,548
I like people in hats with big eyebrows

I like water caught in spiders' webs.

87
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,269
I like wearing all my clothes at once.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,592
I like people who don't smile.

89
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,079
Ever.

90
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,118
And I like people who smile.

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,270
I like hair that goes on and on.

92
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,959
I love food!

I've brought some things for the cook to cook!

95

Oh.

96
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,952
In some ways, I love everything.

97
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,400
It's less, less of a thing then,
like, less distinct, less particular.

98
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,396
I like things that I like but I <i>love</i> everything.

99
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,351
There's more choice in, like...

100
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,518
Even the worst things have things
to love in them.

101
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,270
I love things so much, I feel I can float away.

102
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,189
That's wrong.

103
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,189
My mum understands how to float every day.

104
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,158
I don't understand that so much.

105
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,477
I don't know what you mean
about things I hate.

106
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,995
I hate shoes.

107
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,158
I hate people who change their voices
when they say something important.

108
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,518
I hate my thighs.

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,074
I hate war.

110
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,949
I hate swimming costumes that cling.

111
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,118
I hate dripping taps.

112
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,636
But I also sort of love dripping taps.

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,510
I hate invitations.

114
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,599
I hate radiators.

115
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,908
I hate this.

Wow. Sorry, Dr Stock.

HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,596
The greatest distance
ever walked by a person

119
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,716
continuously balancing a milk bottle
on their head

120
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,035
is 80.<i>9</i>6 miles by Ashrita Furman of New York,
USA, around Victory Field track,

121
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,910
Forest Park, Queens,
April 22nd through to April 23rd 1<i>99</i>8.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,835
It took him 23 hours 35 minutes
to complete the walk.

123
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,235
That's a world record.

124
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,834
And it's one of 14 Ashrita holds.

125
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,835
He is a hero.

126
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,353
He's immortal.

127
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:15,152
And this is my chance to join him
in the Valhalla of world records.

128
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,517
The world record for the most number of socks
worn at once is 71.

129
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,639
Ashrita, this is for you, man.

130
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,268
One. We're away!

131
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,195
16.

132
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,077
Looks bit odd, innit?

133
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,755
22?

134
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,990
No...

135
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,072
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

136
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,673
22. It was definitely 22.

137
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,273
I can't...

138
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,718
22... The record's 71! How am I gonna...

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,438
HE SIGHS

140
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,876
Ashrita. I've let you down, man.

141
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,829
Ow!

142
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,469
Hello?

143
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,596
Ambulance, please.

144
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,397
Yeah, hi, um... My name's Chris Miles
and, um, I put 22 socks on my right foot

145
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,393
and now it's... Well, I can't feel anything
and it really hurts.

146
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,118
So I don't...

147
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,428
What?

148
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,953
No, don't...

149
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,558
This country is going right down the tubes, man.

150
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,634
The longest-ever recorded balance on one foot
was 76 hours 14 minutes

151
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,756
by Arulanantham Suresh Joachim,

152
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,311
a Sri Lankan, at Vihara Maha Devi Park
Open Air Stadium in Sri Lanka.

153
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,594
He started on May 22nd
and he finished on May 27th.

154
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,398
People watched him do it.

155
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,755
It became like a spectator thing, a sport.

156
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,191
<i>That</i> is a world record.

157
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,111
He's a hero.

158
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,630
Arulanantham, I salute you.

159
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,789

DISTORTED VOICE WHISPERS

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,190
It's 8.30. I was supposed to be meeting
Michelle... 45 minutes ago.

162
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,158
We're supposed to be going out tonight
to the '70s student night

163
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,037
to show the uni kids our new dance moves -

164
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,635
the hustle, the bump, the horny Chihuahuas,
Saturday night fiver.

165
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,676
Wasn't gonna know what hit them.

166
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,914
Unfortunately, my "so called" best friend is still
licking the remaining few layers of skin

167
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,194
off Tony's tongue.

168
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,589
The queue's gonna be massive.

169
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,115
We may as well not bother.

170
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,871
Still, though, uni boys.

171
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,474
One or two of them may be mature enough
to chat to.

172
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,877
It's not that I've got anything against men,

173
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,474
I've just never met one.

174
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,872
I mean, there's Tony, who even if Michelle
hadn't surgically attached herself to him,

175
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,029
isn't my type.

176
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,270
Maxxie... Gay.

177
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,158
Chris...

178
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,519
Plus, he's mental.

179
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,829
Anwar...

180
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,354
SHE LAUGHS

181
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,149
He's adorable, but he's a bit like
one of those dogs that hump your leg -

182
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,559
a bit mucky.

183
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,710
And Sid.

184
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,315
I think he can be summed up
by the fact that he left his...

185
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,313
...round my house the other week.

186
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,436
It's a collectable, apparently.

187
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,156
Ugh!

188
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,151
Ooh, Nips, I wanna suck your face.

189
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,912
Ooh, Tony, I love you.

190
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,230
Mwah.

191
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,834
This one time... at band camp...

192
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,670
I'm leaving. I'm definitely leaving.

193
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,759
SHE INHALES AND EXHALES

194
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,999
SHE SNORES

195
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,433
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

196
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,669
(Michelle) Jal.

197
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,398
We're supposed to be going out.

198
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,516
Oh, thanks for turning up.

199
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,158
SHE SIGHS

200
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,832
Come on.

201
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,829
- Michelle!
- Sorry.

202
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,790
So... I've heard quite a lot about this intraweb
thing that everyone keeps banging on about.

203
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,715
Apparently, you can chat to people
you don't even know,

204
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,828
buy books and do something called a google.

205
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,037
I don't know what that is but it sounds filthy.

206
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,875
Anyway, since it's raining
and none of my prospects are returning my texts,

207
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,953
I thought I'd make a video
for you lovely cyber-surfers out there,

208
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,237
you know, to watch, that isn't to do
with any dwarfs and horses and...

209
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,757
putting things in places they don't belong.

210
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,592
Tut, tut, tut.

211
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,838
HE MIMES: <i>We are the chipmunks,</i>
<i>chipmunks are we</i>

PARTY POPPERS EXPLODE

241
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,192
- See, you'll watch anything.
- I know!

242
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,195
JAUNTY MUSIC PLAYS

243
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,400
Hey. So I've literally had hundreds of e-mails
this week asking me about my clothes.

244
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,474
So I've decided to devote this episode
of Michelle Explains It All to fashion.

245
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,119
'OK, the key look here is the all-important

246
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,796
"Please, <i>please</i> give me an extension
on my essay" outfit.

247
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,759
'You're trying to tell people that you're studious,
but also that you're...'

248
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:13,153
(Seductively)... awfully, awfully worried
about getting it exactly right.

249
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,348
You just want to do your very, very best.

250
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,399
You know?

251
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,838
'OK, this look is good for going to the front
of the queue, avoiding the ID minefield

252
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,798
'and convincing the bouncer that
they really are just little aspirins.'

253
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,271
The trick is to make sure that they're looking
at your tits, not at your face.

254
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,588
'This is look is good for meeting the parents
for the first time,

255
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,318
'big family functions etc.

256
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,517
'What you're saying is, "Yes,

257
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,357
"I <i>am</i> sleeping with your son but he's my first
and I really hope we'll stay together for ever."

258
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,591
Except your grandma.
To grandmothers, this look says,

259
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,989
"I love it when little kittens
play with balls of wool."

260
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,194
This one's a bit special.

261
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,635
It says, "Of course
we're only going to the cinema,

262
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,110
"annoying and overbearing
yet easily convinced parental figure."

263
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,714
But with a few adjustments...

264
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,153
...and we've got Tony's old favourite.

265
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,629
"Buy me a drink
and I'll show you how limber I really am."

266
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,599
Now, you must excuse me.
I'm late for a very important date.

267
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,829
SHE BLOWS A KISS

268
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,310
< Bye, Mum. Just off to the cinema.

MAN CLEARS THROAT

270
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,558
MAN CLEARS THROAT

271
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,279
Huh? Huh? What... What's going on?

272
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,993
Oh. Oh, um...

273
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,319
The video for Grandpa's birthday.

274
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,630
Um... Er...

275
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,719
Hello, Grandfather. Hello, Grandmother.

276
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,997
I hope you're getting on awfully well.

277
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,315
(More?)

278
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,358
Um... I hope the weather is clement

279
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,112
and Grandmother's bunions isn't troubling her...

280
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,634
What? What? Sorry! Sorry!

281
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,631
We do not speak of Grandmother's bunions?

282
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,515
Sorry.

283
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,034

What d'you say, blood?
House party, man?

285
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,830
I'll link you. I'll soon come, yeah, I swear...

286
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,796
I'll bell you back, blood.
Bless, bless.

287
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,154
HE SIGHS

288
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,109
I know, I know.

289
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,869
Poor vocabulary reflects poor thought.

290
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,680
So school is great fun.

291
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,717
As well as being an awful lot of hard work.

292
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,191
Obviously, I'm disappointed
not to be following in Dad's footsteps

293
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,751
in St Withingtons but... that ain't me.

294
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,308
I don't want to be some pussyo
that ain't rippin' for the street

295
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,312
man gotta rep his ends.
What, man, Grandpa is feeling what...

296
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,236
Do I have to?

297
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,590
Not the dance, Dad. Not the dance.

298
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,353
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick

299
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,431
Jack jumped over the candlestick

300
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,556
Jack jumped high, Jack jumped low

301
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,995
Jack bent over and burnt his toe.

302
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,437
Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
trim that fanny to that... blah-h-h...

(Sid) 'Cometh the hour, cometh the man.'

304
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,639
For the past three months, I've been getting
ponged on Online Destructathon

305
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,757
by a guy called "Wallothet" from Denmark.

306
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,912
So I've been through the chatrooms.

307
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,675
I've done the research. I've put in the effort.

308
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,671
Work hard.

309
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,478
No rewards are obvious.

310
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,833
I'm gonna show how we do it
in the West Country.

311
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,433
He's Danish bacon.

312
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,390
(Sid) Wallothet. Hi.

313
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,669
Yes, well, I think Princess Kwaku is very much
looking forward to <i>me</i> rescuing her today.

314
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,558
I think she might even have
a little surprise for me.

315
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,154
COMPUTER BEEPS

316
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,708
What d'you mean, what about Michelle?
How d'you know about...

317
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,119
COMPUTER BEEPS

318
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,519
I can't remember telling you that...

319
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,516
She's my best mate's girlfriend, yeah.

320
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,989
Who's my best mate?

321
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,798
His name's Tony.

322
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,956
Yeah, he is a pretty great guy, I guess.

323
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,359
Oh, yes...

324
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,034
Didn't like that, did you, Wallothet?

325
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,389
Uh.

326
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,835
Princess Kwaku, you are my bitch.

327
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,558
Ah...

328
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,077
Come on. Come on...

329
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,752
<i>Yesl</i>

330
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,031
That's not possible. How'd you...?

331
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,873
How did you do that? That's impossible!

332
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,036
What d'you mean, answer my phone?
My phone's not ringing...

333
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,076
PHONE RINGS

334
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,038
Tony. Oh, thank God you've called.
That gimp just whupped me again.

335
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,035
Oh.

336
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,191
Oh, for God sakes, Tony! Three months.

337
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,674
Three fucking months.

338
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,354
Where did you learn how to do
that Danish accent from, anyway?

339
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,318
No, I didn't video it.

340
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,669
No, I didn't.

341
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,078
No, we're <i>not</i> watching it.

342
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,717
Right, I'll see you in ten minutes.

Hi. I'm 16 years old, six foot something,
and my name's Tony.

345
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,992
This is where I live.

346
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,479
It's got pretty much everything I need -

347
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,118
friends to amuse me,

348
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,155
girls to fuck me,

349
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,515
parents to feed me. The essentials.

350
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,276
I would tell you more about myself, but...
I'd just sound like I'm boasting cos, you know.

351
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,839
I'm fucking awesome.

352
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,593
'This is where I hang out. College Green.'

353
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,750
You can pick up weed there, walk to college,

354
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,592
have a few laughs
watching the skaters fall over.

355
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,954
It's a pretty decent spot.

356
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,679
You ever seen Apocalypse Now?

357
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,954
It's nothing like that. But we're working on it.

358
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,109
This is my girlfriend.

359
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,030
'Her name's Michelle.

360
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,476
'I call her Nips,
on account of her funny nipples.'

361
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,154
She doesn't like that.
But she's a good girl, really.

362
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,673
Fucking sexy, too.

363
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,558
But I needn't tell you. You've got eyes.

364
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,073
'This is my best mate.

365
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,151
'His name is Sid.'

366
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,275
We're like birds of a feather.

367
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,554
But he's the fat one.

368
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,758
I think there's a chance that his parents
raised the afterbirth instead of the baby.

369
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,712
Sometimes, when I wonder why
I keep him around,

370
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,631
I have to remember Nietzsche...

371
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,037
"The man of knowledge must be able to
not only love his enemies,

372
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,872
"but hate his friends."

373
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,598
'This is Chris.

374
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,240
'He's a bit...'

375
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,469
Well, a bit Chris.

376
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,755
He'll give you the shirt off his back one minute

377
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,389
and then ten seconds later rob
your asthma medication for something to snort.

378
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,391
'Jal. A musician.

379
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,233
'A bit feisty.'

380
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,072
I try and keep my eye on that one.

381
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,434
Anwar's next.

382
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,875
'He's a Muslim, but he drinks'

383
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,474
and he's the only one of us to get caught
burking off in class.

384
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,915
Twice.

385
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,956
'And I was best mates with Maxxie.'

386
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,191
He's a bit new. He's a bit cool. He's a bit gay.

387
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,429
A vital part of the group.

388
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,318
Right. That's about it.

389
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,474
Remember. Conscience
is but a word that cowards use.

390
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,232
Shakespeare wrote that.

391
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,197
So it must be true.
