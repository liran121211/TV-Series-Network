But he intrigues Liv, who joins him in his die-rolling activities after meeting Miriam, who likes her. The others are less impressed, especially Mini, who accuses Liv of spending too much time with Alex. After Grace's emotional funeral, Alex comforts Liv, but she's newly upset when he says he's gay and uninterested in her as a girlfriend.
