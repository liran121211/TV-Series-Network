Her college friends gate-crash Gregory's party and Alo gets thrown out after accusing Gregory's assistant Ryan of having sex with Mini. She confides her situation in Franky, who advises her to tell Gregory but, never one for responsibility, he leaves for Australia without her, leaving her a cheque for 500 pounds. Alo also rejects her, calling her too callous to be capable of love, but unexpected consolation comes from Eric, who reconciles her with Shelley, after which Franky takes her to an ultrasound clinic, where she weeps tears of joy on seeing her unborn baby.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2061444", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 461, "number_of_episodes": 61}
