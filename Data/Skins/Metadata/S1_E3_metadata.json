Nothing unusual there. Until he discovers a grand in cash and a note from his mum saying she's gone away. So, like any not-so-average pill-popping 17-year-old, Chris embarks on a bender to end all benders. But what do you do after you've thrown the mother of all parties and blown all the money? Well, you sell everything that isn't nailed down and go again--and just hope that everything else will start to make sense. But sometimes, life can make a little more sense than you want it to, and Chris must face the fact that his mum might never be coming home.\u2014Anonymous", "Chris wakes up to find his mum has gone away for a few days, leaving him \u00a31000.
