Someone close by. A hot boy maybe? No such luck. Sketch is Maxxie's stalker, a weird loner who spends most days shut up in a poky flat looking after her disabled mum, so her attention turns to the blond boy who lives on the estate. Soon everything in her life is about Maxxie--if only he would even notice her. Meanwhile, the sixth-form college production of 'Osama: The Musical' is teetering towards disaster under the heavy-handed guidance of lecherous drama teacher Bruce. But Sketch is prepared to do anything to get leading man Maxxie, and if she can't have him, she will make sure that nobody can--especially not his current leading lady Michelle.\u2014Anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1188337", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 1187, "number_of_episodes": 61}
