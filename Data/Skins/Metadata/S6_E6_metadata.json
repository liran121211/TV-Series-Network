Encountering hostility from his peers who blame Matty for Grace's death, Nick steals the money from his father's bank account but the Doctor cheats him and beats him up. Although she has accused him of being always in his brother's shadow and seen him kissing others, Franky offers a thousand pounds which she says is 'an inheritance' but Nick declares the deal off. However, the pair finally admit to their mutual feelings for each other and have sex; while Nick is in the bathroom afterwards, Franky sees a Skype message from Matty but switches the computer off without answering.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2061445", "rating": 7.0, "votes": 440, "number_of_episodes": 61}
