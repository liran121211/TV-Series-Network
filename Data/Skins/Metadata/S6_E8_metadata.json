Rich is too busy revising and attempts to get through to Franky, whom Liv still blames for Grace's death, and Mini comes to nothing. When Matty returns from Morocco, Liv takes him to see Franky but she has no desire to speak to him and another confrontation with Mini leads to a fight and Mini crying out that she is pregnant. A shocked Liv once more feels the pain in her side but a visit to the doctor proves that there is no lump: it was a psychosomatic reaction to Grace's death. Feeling better, Liv visits Grace's grave with her younger sister Maude, Doug, and Rich, and they end up dancing.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2061447", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 463, "number_of_episodes": 61}
