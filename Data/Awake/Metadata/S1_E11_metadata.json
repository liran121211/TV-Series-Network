Dr. Lee says this is progress, finally acknowledging the boy's death. A man who Michael saw in his last moments in his son's world turns up as a talkative figment of Michael's imagination: Michael thinks the man holds the key to getting back to his son. He behaves oddly in front of Vega, he's distracted during an encounter with Emma's father, in his head he replays the fatal accident over and over, and the captain suspends him when he violates protocol. Who's the man in his mind - and what about the accident?\u2014<jhailey@hotmail.com>", "Michael gets desperate when after recurring nightmares about the accident that killed son Rex, he keeps waking up in that reality, and seems to be haunted by a fictive version of detective Ed Hawkins, the colleague who arrived there first. Rather then accepting the hopeful therapist's theory that means he's starting to accept reality, he senses a sinister twist, which turns out to be Ed's actual part in the tragedy.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2256143", "rating": 8.8, "votes": 392, "number_of_episodes": 13}
