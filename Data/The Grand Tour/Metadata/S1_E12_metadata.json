In this programme, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May test out the Jaguar F-Pace, the Bentley Bentayga and the Range Rover Autobiography with a road trip around central Europe taking in some of the most grown-up and not at all childishly rude place names the region has to offer. Also in this episode, Jeremy kills a few preconceptions as he takes to the Eboladrome in the Lexus GS F and legendary movie director Tim Burton crosses the Loch to try Celebrity Brain Crash. Plus, as launch control becomes increasingly common on high performance cars, the hosts examine the point of this feature with a short film presentation."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "6068854", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 1724, "number_of_episodes": 46}
