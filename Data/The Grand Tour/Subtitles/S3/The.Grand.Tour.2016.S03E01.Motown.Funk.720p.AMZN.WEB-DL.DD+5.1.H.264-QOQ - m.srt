3
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,960
Hello, everybody!
Thank you.

4
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:06,007
Thank you very much.

5
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:09,757
Greetings, everybody.
Thank you so much.

6
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:15,820
Thanks, everybody.
Thank you.

7
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:19,359
Thank you so much.
And, yes!

8
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:22,648
We're back!

9
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,160
We are!

10
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,680
Now, a lot of people
have been saying,

11
00:01:26,758 --> 00:01:29,976
"Why has it taken so long?
What have you been doing?"

12
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,312
Well, hopefully we can answer
that with this short montage

13
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,734
of what you can expect over
the next... ahem... 13 weeks.

14
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:41,562

Aargh!

40
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:57,605
There must've been 30 or 40 people
in the room when the police arrived.

41
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,730
Whoa!

42
00:02:59,823 --> 00:03:01,933
Clarkson!

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,449
Jesus Christ,
I'm too close to the edge.

44
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,750
Oh!

45
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,855
- Let's sing a song.
- No.

46
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:17,175
I am sitting
where Jim Clark sat!

47
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,637
Going in hard and hot!

48
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:25,717
- We're fleeing!
- OK, flee.

49
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:29,597
Well, he'll be using
a pistol, won't he?

50
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:34,397
♪ Do the Strand ♪

51
00:03:39,993 --> 00:03:41,175
I think...

52
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:44,044
I think you're gonna
like this series.

53
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:47,480
And I particularly think you're
going to like how it begins.

54
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:50,267
Because even over here,
on this side of the pond,

55
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,043
we recognise that Detroit
is the spiritual home

56
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:57,722
to anyone whose
communion wine is petrol

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,191
and whose heart beats
like a big, lumpy, wet V8.

58
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:05,871
Which is why this week,
and it's long overdue,

59
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:09,187
The Grand Tour
is off to the Motor City...

60
00:04:09,363 --> 00:04:11,517
with an idea.

61
00:04:39,523 --> 00:04:42,839
Of course, the whole
world knows that Detroit

62
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:45,997
is now a shadow
of its former self.

63
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:49,907
But we also know
that efforts are being made

64
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,628
to bring life
back to the ruins...

65
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:55,560
with urban farms.

66
00:04:57,432 --> 00:05:00,574
Local people are being
encouraged to grow...

67
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,855
kale and beans and seeds,

68
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,941
in plots like this where houses
and businesses once stood.

69
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,026
It breaks your heart.

70
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:16,488
I mean, this is Detroit.

71
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:21,011
It shouldn't be a help-yourself,
pop-up street allotment

72
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:24,019
for organic
vegan peace hippies,

73
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:29,863
when it could be a pulsating
playground for the petrolhead.

74
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,108
It has the roads,
it has the space,

75
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:37,761
it was built by
the rumble of a V8

76
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,621
and it should rumble
to that sound once more.

77
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,600
So that's what
we've come here to do...

78
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,621
make some noise.

79
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,535
These are the toys
we'll be using.

80
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:28,894
Three American muscle cars,

81
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:34,449
all of which have been tuned to
a tyre-shredding DEFCON one.

82
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:43,332
I have the Ford Mustang
RTR Spec 3.

83
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:50,280
Mr Slowly has
what's called The Exorcist.

84
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:56,659
And in his whining Dodge
Challenger Demon...

85
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:02,214
Hammond has an erection.

86
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:07,738
Ah-ha-ha!

87
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,840
To make this,
they took a Hellcat -

88
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,519
I drove one before
on the show -

89
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:17,457
and just made it "more".

90
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:19,474
More of everything.

91
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,707
I have 840 horsepower,

92
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:24,800
a massive supercharger...

93
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,277
and on the bonnet there,
or hood,

94
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:32,488
that's the biggest hood scoop
ever fitted to a production car.

95
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:33,573
Ever.

96
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:39,790
Yeah!

97
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,135
Noise!

98
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,034
Noise in the city!

99
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:01,214
Bloody hellfire!

100
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,964
This car is tuned
by Hennessey.

101
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:06,144
They've taken
a standard Camaro

102
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:08,114
and they've given it
1,000 horsepower.

103
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,308
Jesus Christ!

104
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:20,745
They haven't touched anything
else, only the engine.

105
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:22,581
Wheels are standard,
brakes are standard,

106
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,691
suspension is standard,
bodywork is standard.

107
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:26,657
It's all standard.

108
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:29,519
Except the power.

109
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:37,480
Jeez,
I can't even steer it.

110
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,237
It's-It's idiotic, honestly.

111
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:46,206
And yea, though
I walk in the shadow

112
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:49,409
of the valley of death,
I will fear no evil.

113
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,769
Because I am The Exorcist!

114
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:10,425
This may look
small and delicate

115
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:13,373
compared to the other two,
but be in no doubt,

116
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,230
it has the muscle car
credentials.

117
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,891
Oh, yeah.

118
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:25,222
The fact is that the engine
in Hammond's car...

119
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:29,862
is a push rod, two valve,
iron museum piece.

120
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:33,620
And May's car, yes,
it has 1,000 horsepower,

121
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,386
but it's running
on standard brakes.

122
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:41,026
This... This is just
a little bit cleverer.

123
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:45,659
They haven't just put a supercharger
on it and left it at that.

124
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:48,448
They've stiffened up the
suspension and lowered it

125
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:50,800
and stiffened
the anti-roll bars.

126
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:54,386
So it can do this.

127
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:59,379
Jesus H Christ!

128
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:03,560
And it can do this.

129
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,293
Yes!

130
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:12,690
This, then, is the Anthony
Joshua of muscle cars.

131
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:16,470
Big and brawny,
but it has brains as well.

132
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:21,063
Then there's its name.

133
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:23,454
It's the RTR,
which stands for,

134
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:26,344
and I'm not making this up,
Ready to Rock!

135
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:33,813
These three cars, then,

136
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:36,430
they're the perfect
fairground rides

137
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,227
in our perfect
petrolhead theme park.

138
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:43,235
I mean, people
travel all the way to Florida

139
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:44,821
to look at a man
in a mouse suit

140
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:48,310
and watch an implausible train
have an unrealistic crash.

141
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:51,560
Why not come here in your car
and do this?

142
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:58,954
Whoo!

143
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:01,876
What a day!

144
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:14,727
I just can't get over James
May is The Ex-cre-cist

145
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:20,630
I am surprised to see you two
so upbeat about this trip.

146
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,733
Why do you say that?

147
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,572
Well, you're always saying how
much you don't like muscle cars.

148
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:28,149
Yeah, I just say that
to annoy you.

149
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:29,952
Oh, right.

150
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:35,305
Nobody intelligent admits
that they like muscle cars,

151
00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:39,577
but secretly, deep down,
everybody does.

152
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:41,954
They're like
power rock ballads.

153
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:44,337
I mean, if you're driving
along with friends

154
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:47,696
and Don't Stop Believing by
Journey comes on the radio,

155
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,688
you say, "This is rubbish," and you
huff and puff and turn it off.

156
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,266
If you're on your own and it comes on,
you turn it up and you sing along.

157
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:57,457
You do.

158
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:02,743
Chaps, did you know mine only
comes with one seat as standard?

159
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,813
- Really?
- What?

160
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,837
As standard,
you get one seat in a Demon.

161
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:10,079
You can opt to have
the others put back in

162
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:11,829
and it costs you a dollar.

163
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:14,276
Which seat do they put in
as standard?

164
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,204
Eventually, we decided to
pull over in our motoring theme park

165
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,390
to see which of our
fairground muscle rides

166
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:34,613
would be the fastest...

167
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:38,266
in a street drag race.

168
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,878
So what I'm thinking is here,
when the lights go green...

169
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:50,267
What's a quarter of a mile,
just beyond the church?

170
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:51,853
Yeah, something like that.
Perfect.

171
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:54,649
- What if the police come?
- Well, he won't. He's in Beverly Hills.

172
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:57,399
- I've seen the movie.
- Why can't we just do this

173
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,680
on a racetrack or a runway
like we usually do?

174
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:01,750
Because we're here to prove
that this is a racetrack.

175
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:05,188
Detroit is empty now and should just
be used for this sort of thing.

176
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,642
Yes, yes, but it isn't a real
race, an actual racetrack.

177
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
- No, it is!
- It is!

178
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:10,173
This is where
the muscle car was born.

179
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:12,235
- I can't do it.
- Why can't you do it?

180
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:13,860
Because Dodge
only lent me that car

181
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:16,550
if I promised not to do any drag
racing on the road with it.

182
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,501
What? That's what it's for!

183
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:21,126
- I know.
- That's literally what it's for.

184
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:23,298
Yes, I know, but
that's the way it is. Sorry..

185
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:24,727
D'you think
it's an insurance...?

186
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,642
- It is, because it's him.
- No. It's not.

187
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,024
- Don't want it on the roof.
- "Who's driving it?" Richard Hammond.

188
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:30,110
You can't drive it.

189
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:32,563
It's just what they said
and I'm really sorry.

190
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,188
- So, we can't do it, I'm sorry.
- We can.

191
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:37,024
You're not gonna do it
without that...

192
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:39,196
Uh... let me think.
Yeah, we are.

193
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:42,233
Just right... Just right
the way, right the way off.

194
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:45,990
One for all and all for yourselves,
that's how it goes, isn't it?

195
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:51,207
Having decided to make the doorway
of a barber shop the finishing line,

196
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:54,207
James and I
prepared for the race.

197
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:59,824
I'm only doing this to annoy Hammond.
I mean, I can't possibly win.

198
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,777
Yes,
I've got a supercharged V8,

199
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:05,777
but it only produces
720 horsepower.

200
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:10,453
That's 280 less
than The Exorcist.

201
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:14,152
I don't wanna sound like you, but
the launch control in this car

202
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,824
is so complicated there's
a YouTube video about it.

203
00:14:16,902 --> 00:14:18,910
And I have watched it,
but I've forgotten.

204
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:22,261
Why don't we have a gentleman's
agreement to not use launch control?

205
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:25,691
Well, that might save
my clutch, so...

206
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:28,839
Yes, right.
We won't use launch control.

207
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:30,760
- I've got a manual gearbox.
- You can both do it

208
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,033
naked for all I care.

209
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:33,493
Just get on with it.

210
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,402
Oo-ooh, look at Captain
Cheerful over there!

211
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,160
Air con is off.

212
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,877
May got a good start.

213
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:19,488
Come on, come on,
come on, come on,

214
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:21,974
there's only
a one-car length in it!

215
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:23,693
Easy!

216
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:26,308
Bloody Nora,
that was close!

217
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:28,830
But I got a terrible start,
so we gotta do it again, May.

218
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:35,021
Put it in first gear.

219
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,769
Whoa!

220
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,275
I can't do it.
It's spinning its wheels.

221
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:52,831
Woo-hoo, hoo-hoo!

222
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:57,159
You do know you're both
too old for this, don't you?

223
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:01,652
What, for driving muscle cars up
and down the public roads of Detroit?

224
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,738
Because nobody else
is using them.

225
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,682
Well, Richard Hammond
certainly isn't using them.

226
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:13,479
Since it was one-all and we were
having enormous fun annoying Hammond,

227
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:16,221
we decided to go again.

228
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:18,955
What is this,
best of 30 now?

229
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:21,346
What else are we gonna do?

230
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:23,729
Keep going till
one of you wets yourselves.

231
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,354
For the next 17 runs,

232
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:31,120
the result was always
the same.

233
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:33,791
Thank you very much.

234
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,237
Come on! Come on!

235
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:40,737
Give up, buddy.

236
00:16:43,643 --> 00:16:44,799
I'm angry.

237
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:46,564
I'm not giving in, James.
One more.

238
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:48,773
Oh, for God's sake!

239
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,877
I gave him my word I wouldn't
use launch control.

240
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:56,604
I'm simply going to go back
on that and not tell him.

241
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,914
That was a good gear change.
So was that.

242
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,151
But there's just nothing I can do to get
up with that 1,000 horsepower monster.

243
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:16,333
Finally,
I waved the white flag.

244
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:18,471
And then we took
a closer look

245
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:22,530
at the savage beating
heart of The Exorcist.

246
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,541
And that's the standard
Corvette engine, basically.

247
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,518
- Z06, yeah.
- With a supercharger plonked on the top.

248
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:32,807
- That's there, yes?
- Yes, 2.9 litre supercharger.

249
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,698
So the bit they've bolted
to your engine

250
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:38,424
is bigger than most
European engines?

251
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:40,956
- Yes.
- So is the one on mine. It's 2.7 litres.

252
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:44,503
Yeah, not as big. The point is,
Hammond, this is The Exorcist.

253
00:17:44,581 --> 00:17:47,196
The job of The Exorcist
is to vanquish the Demon.

254
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,735
It's like, you remember
in the '60s, I think,

255
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:51,952
De Tomaso made a car
called the Mangusta,

256
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:54,255
which is Italian
for mongoose.

257
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,352
Yes, and a mongoose
can kill a cobra, can't it?

258
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:57,645
That's why they did it.

259
00:17:57,723 --> 00:18:00,035
Yes, but this hasn't
vanquished the Demon.

260
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,495
- It hasn't beaten it.
- Tell you what.

261
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:05,952
Why don't you find a racetrack
or a runway somewhere, OK?

262
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:07,552
I'll gracefully bow out.

263
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:12,762
And we can have a race
between good... and evil.

264
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:25,242
First, though, we decided to find out which
of our cars makes the loudest noise.

265
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:28,832
There were, of course,
many possible locations

266
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:31,049
for this important test.

267
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:36,922
But eventually, we found one
that was absolutely ideal.

268
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:52,072
What is this place?

269
00:18:52,154 --> 00:18:55,229
Well, it obviously
was a theatre.

270
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:56,872
They built it on the site

271
00:18:56,954 --> 00:19:01,242
of Henry Ford's
first ever workshop.

272
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:04,935
- And when I say theatre...
- Oh, wow!

273
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:06,895
So it was in 1925
they built it,

274
00:19:06,977 --> 00:19:09,855
when Detroit was just about the
richest city in the world.

275
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:12,072
- You can see that.
- They can just build that.

276
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:15,872
And then in the '70s, it was
converted into a rock venue.

277
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,192
So, I mean, look at these
tickets I've got for it.

278
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:22,175
- ZZ Top.
- ZZ Top and T Rex.

279
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:24,672
- What a gig that would've been!
- It would've been fantastic.

280
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:27,335
Sly And The Family Stone,
Spencer Davis.

281
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,192
Steve Winwood
has performed in here.

282
00:19:29,274 --> 00:19:30,935
David Bowie
performed in here.

283
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:33,392
- Blue Oyster Cult, Bob Seger.
- This was a serious venue.

284
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:35,055
Oh, serious venue.

285
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:37,575
And then, there were some
credit card companies

286
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:39,632
in the offices
which are behind that wall.

287
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:42,335
And they said,
"We need some parking."

288
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:45,095
And just bought it and turned it
into a multi-storey car park.

289
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:47,152
- That's amazing.
- Takes the romance out of it.

290
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:49,032
It's sort of staggering.

291
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:52,415
It's the birthplace of
Henry Ford's business.

292
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:54,432
- Yeah.
- Then a theatre.

293
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:56,237
It's a car park.

294
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,779
We can bring some theatre
back with our noise test.

295
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:00,672
Actually, there's a kind of
poetry to it, it's beautiful.

296
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:02,672
- Precisely.
- Not just bringing the poetry,

297
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:04,735
also bringing
the decibel-o-meter.

298
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:08,379
Oh, perfect. So you
can go and uh... go first.

299
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:10,415
Why am I going first?

300
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:13,955
- I just said you can go first.
- He did. I heard him say it.

301
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:17,592
Since the
owners feared the noise

302
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,952
from our engines would bring
down the crumbling roof,

303
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:24,055
we were given
protective clothing.

304
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:26,440
We have to put this on
because there may be dust.

305
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,507
There will be dust.

306
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:32,847
Traction off.

307
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,847
I'll just make wheel spin.

308
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:38,152
Wheel spin, that just makes
a huge amount of noise.

309
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:40,895
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

310
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,922
Oh, yeah, check it out!

311
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:03,510
I can see jack shit.

312
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,242
- God, that's pretty horrible.
- How loud?

313
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:11,872
- Well, at its peak...
- Yeah?

314
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:15,081
125.2.

315
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:16,876
Well, wait a minute, you
don't know, you haven't...

316
00:21:16,954 --> 00:21:19,120
- You're the first to go.
- 125?

317
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:20,697
Yes.

318
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:23,935
The Who.

319
00:21:24,174 --> 00:21:27,565
Widely regarded to be the
loudest rock band of all time.

320
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:31,049
- Yes.
- 126 decibels.

321
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,015
Deep Purple,
a mere 117 decibels.

322
00:21:35,097 --> 00:21:38,415
That car is louder
than Deep Purple.

323
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,682
But probably a lot quieter
than my Demon.

324
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:52,312
Any minute now, a paramedic will
be cutting his trousers off.

325
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,512
He should've taken
them off before he got in.

326
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:56,552
I don't know why
he wears trousers.

327
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:58,592
Here we go.
Ready in three, two...

328
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,925
Oh, wait a minute,
it hasn't done it.

329
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,565
Easy mistake.

330
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:12,036
We've all done it - forgotten the
key when you're doughnutting

331
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:15,232
in a Detroit theatre that's been
turned into a multi-storey car park.

332
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:17,242
Everybody's been there.

333
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:20,784
OK. In three, two...

334
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:46,857
- 125.2 to beat.
- Yeah.

335
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:50,123
Doesn't make a lot of noise.

336
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:52,295
118.8, tiptoe boy.

337
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:56,174
It's got a 2.7 litre capacity
supercharger on it!

338
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:57,596
Yeah, but,
it doesn't make any noise.

339
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:59,612
They didn't build it for this,
they built it for drag racing.

340
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,916
- And they wouldn't let me do that, so...
- Oh, did they?

341
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:05,175
- How do we know?
- Well, they did.

342
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:08,592
Before this sore
point became even sorer,

343
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:11,082
I sent James off
to have a go.

344
00:23:12,531 --> 00:23:14,586
Don't think
he's ever done a doughnut.

345
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:16,605
- No. No.
- In his life.

346
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,035
We are about to witness James
D May losing his virginity.

347
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,632
Popping his doughnut cherry.

348
00:23:27,285 --> 00:23:29,260
James May,
are you ready?

349
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:32,164
Fire it up in three...

350
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,862
Cock.

351
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:49,472
Bollocks.

352
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:57,690
It took him a little while,
but eventually he got the hang of it.

353
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,175
What's my score?

354
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,424
Why don't we just go?

355
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:17,952
- Come on, James, gotta go.
- Yep, moving on.

356
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:19,737
- What was it?
- Oh, I've wiped it.

357
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,996
- No, you haven't.
- It was 12.

358
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:24,689
Come on... Why've I got this on my face?
What was it?

359
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:27,713
It was 128,
so just 2.8 more than me.

360
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,424
- So more?
- Yes.

361
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:30,815
- Hold that.
- Why?

362
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:32,112
Please just hold that.

363
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,667
Oh, I hate the victory dance!

364
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:36,752
- I hate the victory dance.
- Good, right, let's move on.

365
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:38,495
How much is your car?
How much?

366
00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:40,924
- 98, something like that?
- £98,000.

367
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:42,459
- Yes.
- £40,000.

368
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:44,392
Yeah, but mine's better,
so it's more expensive.

369
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:46,432
- £40,000.
- It's faster and louder.

370
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:49,838
720 horsepower, £40,000.

371
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:53,242
Am I the only person here
who understands muscle cars?

372
00:24:54,947 --> 00:24:57,372
That's a ridiculous thing
to say!

373
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:02,870
Having had
a very busy morning,

374
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:04,855
we were now hungry.

375
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:08,362
Which, in this part of town,
was a problem.

376
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:12,642
Not an abundance of restaurants
around here, is there?

377
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:16,217
I haven't seen any.

378
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:17,990
I just noticed
a Coney Island Restaurant

379
00:25:18,068 --> 00:25:21,588
but I'm afraid it's
been shut for 30 years.

380
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:25,174
Having failed
to find even a takeout,

381
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:28,375
we started to look
for a hotel.

382
00:25:28,553 --> 00:25:30,791
But there wasn't
one of those either.

383
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,307
So we decided to buy a house.

384
00:25:38,177 --> 00:25:39,912
Let me show you
what we've got.

385
00:25:39,994 --> 00:25:43,375
Handsome vestibule, feature
tiled floor, front room here,

386
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:46,272
feature fireplace, loads of
light from all these windows.

387
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:50,272
This, I would say, use as a dining room
because it's adjacent to the kitchen.

388
00:25:50,354 --> 00:25:52,752
Needs the appliances
refitting, not a big job.

389
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:56,455
In there, I would say that's
a really handy games room,

390
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,992
TV room, overlooking the
garden and the double garage.

391
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:02,415
Here, perfect for a home
office, maybe a snug.

392
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:05,712
Upstairs four bedrooms,
and here's the kicker.

393
00:26:05,794 --> 00:26:09,455
An independent granny flat
with its own kitchen,

394
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:13,352
so Jeremy can live up there semi-independently
for as long as he can manage.

395
00:26:13,434 --> 00:26:16,442
And the price?
$2,200.

396
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,495
Is that really only...
What was it, $2,200?

397
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:22,895
- Yeah.
- 1800 quid.

398
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:24,095
Amazing, isn't it?

399
00:26:24,177 --> 00:26:26,072
Shall I show you
something else amazing?

400
00:26:26,154 --> 00:26:31,175
Captain Slow has fallen for
this eco-allotment claptrap.

401
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:34,752
I haven't fallen for it, and it's not
claptrap, it's just a vegetable plot.

402
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:36,952
- It's only a bit.
- Buy food, don't grow it.

403
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:39,255
- Why not?
- That's a farmer's job.

404
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:42,695
Turning a city into a vegetable
garden is ridiculous.

405
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:44,975
No, who's turned a city
into a vegetable garden?

406
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:46,952
That's what they want to do
and you're encouraging them.

407
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:48,992
Detroit should be
for petrolheads.

408
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,615
It should be for massive V8s
like our cars.

409
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:54,335
It's a great idea by a
city that's having a bad time

410
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:56,615
and trying to use its initiative.
What's wrong with it?

411
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:58,232
It's not as if there's any
vegetables in the shops.

412
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:00,952
- New is better.
- I am not listening to any more of this.

413
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:03,055
I am going to go off.
I'm gonna find a shop.

414
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:04,632
I'm gonna come back
with burgers.

415
00:27:04,714 --> 00:27:06,832
Well, you can have
some curly kale in them.

416
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:08,352
Bloody allotment!

417
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:12,392
Just because
he's become a vegetarian

418
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:15,775
doesn't mean that absolutely
everybody has to be one.

419
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:18,912
- Don't be a moron!
- Well, I can't get out, he's parked in the way.

420
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,832
Well, on that terrible
disappointment, back to the tent.

421
00:27:34,377 --> 00:27:36,615
You asked for it.
You asked for it.

422
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,192
We never got
the burgers either.

423
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:39,512
No, we didn't.

424
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:41,137
We uh...

425
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:46,392
We shall pick that up
later on.

426
00:27:46,474 --> 00:27:50,152
But now it is time to drop
the car keys of chat

427
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:53,255
down the drain of debate...

428
00:27:53,337 --> 00:27:55,592
on Conversation Street.

429
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:04,095
That's a little weird.

430
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:06,752
- How'd you do that?
- Don't know. Can't remember.

431
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:11,552
Can I just begin by saying that I
think the very concept of incongruity

432
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:15,112
was defined in that film
in Detroit by James May,

433
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,575
the slowest moving man
in history,

434
00:28:17,657 --> 00:28:20,455
driving around in
a car called The Exorcist.

435
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:23,312
Yeah, it just doesn't work.
"James May is The Exorcist."

436
00:28:23,394 --> 00:28:26,952
No, I mean, if he's gonna have a car,
it should be called The Florist.

437
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:29,442
Or The Organist.

438
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:32,792
- Simple change to that, The Onanist.
- Nice.

439
00:28:32,874 --> 00:28:35,574
- I think The Onanist would work well.
- Have you quite finished?

440
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:36,504
Uh... yeah.

441
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,918
Good, actually I'd like
to talk about Motor City.

442
00:28:38,996 --> 00:28:40,899
More specifically,
what's happening to it.

443
00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:42,432
I'll tell you
what's happening to it.

444
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,592
It is being slowly ruined
by vegetable-ists.

445
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:47,175
- Oh, God.
- It is!

446
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:50,175
There are two million acres
of land in Detroit, OK?

447
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:54,042
Would anybody like to guess how many acres
have been given over to allotments?

448
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:57,512
Six.

449
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:59,712
- 1,000.
- No, it's three.

450
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:01,255
Three acres.

451
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:03,512
- And he's driven over two of them.
- Exactly.

452
00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:05,975
Yes, and rightly so.
It's like cancer.

453
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:08,015
- It's not like cancer!
- It is!

454
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:11,135
If you said, "I've got
two billion cells in my body"

455
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,912
and only three are cancerous
so I shall do nothing..."

456
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:14,655
You don't, you cut them out.

457
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:17,272
Yeah, but cancer is a serious
threat to your health.

458
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:19,312
Well, so are vegetables.
They are.

459
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:21,440
You do know you're mad?

460
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:23,232
No, I'll tell you
what I'm mad about.

461
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:25,112
I'm mad as hell
about Detroit.

462
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:29,752
Because in 1960, that was
the richest city in America.

463
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:33,295
The richest.
And now it is the poorest.

464
00:29:33,377 --> 00:29:37,312
And no other city anywhere in the
world has collapsed that quickly.

465
00:29:37,394 --> 00:29:39,752
What about Hiroshima?

466
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:42,672
Apart from Hiroshima.

467
00:29:42,754 --> 00:29:44,455
Pompeii.

468
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:47,535
Yes, apart from
Hiroshima and Pompeii,

469
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:49,695
no city has collapsed
as fast as Detroit has.

470
00:29:49,777 --> 00:29:51,752
- It's unbelievable.
- Incredible the scale of it.

471
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:55,487
There used to be
43 car factories in Detroit.

472
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:56,735
43.

473
00:29:56,817 --> 00:29:59,276
Now two. Just two.

474
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:02,712
I actually think it's because
America won the war, weirdly.

475
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:04,615
- Vietnam.
- Really?

476
00:30:04,697 --> 00:30:06,935
No, I was lying.
They lost that one.

477
00:30:07,017 --> 00:30:08,612
Not in all the films,
they didn't.

478
00:30:08,698 --> 00:30:11,472
They won in the films but when you
add up all the battles they won,

479
00:30:11,554 --> 00:30:13,784
- weirdly they lost the war.
- Did they?

480
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:15,632
No, I'm actually talking
about World War II.

481
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:19,512
At the end of that, Japan had lost its
empire, so it lost all its resources.

482
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:23,192
So they were forced to make compact,
economical, efficient cars.

483
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:25,415
And then the oil crisis
hit in 1973,

484
00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:27,192
and the Americans,
with their big V8s,

485
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:30,192
were forced to buy small, compact,
economical cars from Japan.

486
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:32,512
And then realised
they were better.

487
00:30:32,594 --> 00:30:36,765
No, I think it's because
American cars are too cheap.

488
00:30:36,843 --> 00:30:37,757
Too cheap?

489
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,523
It's a business thing.
That's the problem.

490
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:43,593
Sorry, everyone, I fear we are about
to get an economic lecture from...

491
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,345
Chancellor Hammond here.

492
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:48,944
- Well, no.
- The other Chancellor Hammond.

493
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:52,579
No, you are... Now concentrate, let
me put this into context for you.

494
00:30:52,657 --> 00:30:55,374
A lot of supercars have arrived
on the scene recently.

495
00:30:55,476 --> 00:30:58,192
I've got pictures of them.
This is the McLaren Speedtail,

496
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,232
that's 1,000 horsepower.

497
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:02,055
Costs £2.1 million.

498
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:03,872
- And its wheels are odd.
- They are. They don't match.

499
00:31:03,954 --> 00:31:07,319
This is the Aston Martin Valkyrie,
that's 1,000 horsepower again.

500
00:31:07,397 --> 00:31:09,647
£2.5 million.

501
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:13,632
This one, that's
the Ferrari FXX-K Evo,

502
00:31:13,757 --> 00:31:16,615
1,000 horsepower,
£3.5 million.

503
00:31:16,697 --> 00:31:18,655
Best looking Ferrari
of all time, that.

504
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:21,552
- It does look amazing, yeah,
- It is absolutely staggering.

505
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,992
However, they've all got
1,000 horsepower,

506
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:27,375
which means
they will all be undriveable.

507
00:31:27,457 --> 00:31:30,032
Yeah, whereas my Exorcist
has 1,000 horsepower

508
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:33,255
and is undriveable
for under £100,000.

509
00:31:33,337 --> 00:31:37,015
Yes, and that's... that's
exactly my economic point.

510
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:38,672
They're selling them
too cheap.

511
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:40,140
They're just giving it away.

512
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:43,960
If American carmakers doubled the
price of the cars that they sell,

513
00:31:44,074 --> 00:31:47,815
bear with me, they would double
the money that they make.

514
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:49,792
It's not that complicated
when you think about it.

515
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,210
If you follow the logic.

516
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:54,183
I've said before, the wrong Hammond
is in charge of Britain's...

517
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:56,315
Yeah. It is incredible.

518
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:57,928
You've got a supply
and demand graph.

519
00:31:58,146 --> 00:31:59,847
If you take away
the demand axis,

520
00:31:59,977 --> 00:32:02,592
life becomes much easier
when it's all just supply.

521
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:05,152
Precisely. The Hellcat
that I was driving

522
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:07,095
was priced at £67,000.

523
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:09,312
- Yeah.
- People are now selling them,

524
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,335
that same car,
second-hand for £120,000.

525
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:15,552
And one bloke has advertised
one for half a million.

526
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:19,202
So that means they were
too cheap and I'm right.

527
00:32:20,777 --> 00:32:22,952
- It is hard to argue with that.
- Unassailable.

528
00:32:23,034 --> 00:32:25,523
And we don't have time,
so let's move it on.

529
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:28,735
Because you may remember
in the very first show

530
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:30,592
of The Grand Tour
in the first season...

531
00:32:30,674 --> 00:32:33,735
I was blown
away by a McLaren P1.

532
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:36,232
Yeah, I do remember.
You said it would be faster

533
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:38,944
than the Porsche 918
and the Ferrari LaFerrari.

534
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:39,579
Mm-hm.

535
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,695
And, no, wait a minute,
it wasn't, was it?

536
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:44,992
And as a result, the only thing
that got blown away was your house.

537
00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:47,495
- That's undoubtedly true.
- Yeah.

538
00:32:47,577 --> 00:32:50,432
But the thing is, it remains
to this day the most exciting,

539
00:32:50,514 --> 00:32:53,255
most brutal, most visceral
car I've ever driven.

540
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:55,592
And I didn't think
it could ever be topped,

541
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,392
but McLaren
have given it a bash.

542
00:32:57,474 --> 00:33:02,671
And I thought, "Well, if they've
built a car that can out-P1 a P1",

543
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:05,304
I'd better test it
somewhere a bit less...

544
00:33:05,382 --> 00:33:07,575
narrow
and a bit less tree-lined

545
00:33:07,657 --> 00:33:10,512
and a bit less covered in deers
and badgers than the Eboladrome.

546
00:33:11,777 --> 00:33:14,975
So I took it to the fastest
racetrack in Europe,

547
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:17,602
which is... Actually, anyone
wanna guess which it is?

548
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:20,072
- Monza?
- No, not Monza.

549
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:21,615
- Spa.
- Not Spa.

550
00:33:21,697 --> 00:33:22,832
- Do you know?
- What?

551
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:24,855
Do you know?

552
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:26,072
Of course I know!

553
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:29,575
- You know? That's unusual.
- Why is it unusual?

554
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:33,472
You didn't know any of the answers on
Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, did you?

555
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,375
I mean...

556
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:37,432
I'm just saying.

557
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:39,575
You didn't.

558
00:33:39,657 --> 00:33:41,152
No. But, no.

559
00:33:41,234 --> 00:33:42,655
No.

560
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:45,735
They didn't ask me any of the
questions I knew the answers to.

561
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,992
- That's what it was.
- No, but it's not called.

562
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:50,592
Who Wants To Know Things
Jeremy Happens To Know, is it?

563
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,735
- It's Thruxton.
- What is?

564
00:33:52,817 --> 00:33:55,085
Thruxton is the fastest
racetrack in Europe.

565
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:58,030
So that's where I took
the new McLaren.

566
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,912
Engine's
beginning throttling down now.

567
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,882
And lift-off.

568
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:07,752
Clear of the tower.

569
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:09,682
Go with throttle up.

570
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:19,482
This is the car in question.

571
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,872
And let's begin by giving
you some of the headlines.

572
00:34:24,954 --> 00:34:29,552
There's no hybrid drive,
like there was in the P1.

573
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:34,442
But even so, the 4 litre,
twin turbocharged V8...

574
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:39,282
produces 789 horsepower.

575
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:45,522
And that means
it's still pretty fast.

576
00:34:47,297 --> 00:34:48,857
OK, right.

577
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,962
Left foot on brake.

578
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:56,922
Push launch.

579
00:34:58,857 --> 00:35:00,175
Full throttle.

580
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:03,002
Boost building, boost ready,
we're gone.

581
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:11,122
0-60 in 2.7 seconds.

582
00:35:13,017 --> 00:35:15,882
That's 120... 150.

583
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:18,242
Jesus H Christ!

584
00:35:22,257 --> 00:35:25,792
It'll actually do 186
in 18 seconds,

585
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,855
and flat out is 208.

586
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:31,642
And that's really
alarming.

587
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:34,392
I'm gonna be sick. Ohh!

588
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:35,937
Whoa!

589
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:44,122
The thing is, though, that lots of supercars
are as fast as the McLaren these days.

590
00:35:45,737 --> 00:35:48,272
Some are even more powerful,

591
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,522
and even more dramatic
to behold.

592
00:35:52,937 --> 00:35:55,362
But this is called the Senna.

593
00:35:55,937 --> 00:35:57,655
It's named after
Ayrton Senna,

594
00:35:57,737 --> 00:36:00,312
and Ayrton was not a man
who spent his evenings

595
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:04,055
cruising around Harrods
at nine miles an hour.

596
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:07,232
And nor was he a man who spent
much time at drag strips,

597
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:09,272
doing the standing quarter.

598
00:36:09,354 --> 00:36:10,615
No.

599
00:36:10,697 --> 00:36:14,802
Ayrton was a man who made
his name at places like this.

600
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,002
Racetracks.

601
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:25,962
This is what
the Senna was built to do:

602
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:29,032
get round any track,
anywhere,

603
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:33,722
faster than any other
road car ever made.

604
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:39,352
To do this,
they had to make it light.

605
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:42,295
And they have.
The doors, for example.

606
00:36:42,377 --> 00:36:44,792
Even though they have
windows in them here,

607
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:49,895
so passers-by can see
the driver's trousers,

608
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:52,055
they only weigh
nine kilograms

609
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:55,015
and that's less than
one of Kate Moss's arms.

610
00:36:55,097 --> 00:36:56,752
And then there's the seats.

611
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:59,775
They only weigh
eight kilograms.

612
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:02,282
I've eaten puddings
that weigh more than that!

613
00:37:02,977 --> 00:37:04,672
Go with throttle up.

614
00:37:04,754 --> 00:37:07,335
Having got the weight out,

615
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:11,122
the Senna's nearly a quarter
of a ton lighter than the P1.

616
00:37:11,777 --> 00:37:14,202
They had to think about grip.

617
00:37:15,697 --> 00:37:18,232
They started with
a new type of Pirelli tyre

618
00:37:18,314 --> 00:37:22,472
that clings on like a panicky
child on a fairground ride.

619
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:26,175
And then there's
this moving rear wing,

620
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:28,552
which is somehow road legal.

621
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:31,735
It actually hangs
from these pylons,

622
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:33,792
rather than sits
on top of them,

623
00:37:33,874 --> 00:37:36,272
because that
improves downforce.

624
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,175
I asked James May
to explain why,

625
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:43,402
but I'm afraid, after three
hours, I went into a deep sleep.

626
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:48,432
The next most import thing
when it comes to lap times

627
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:51,442
is how well it slows down.

628
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:56,752
I was once in a 24-hour race
at Silverstone,

629
00:37:56,834 --> 00:38:00,455
driving a terrible
old diesel BMW

630
00:38:00,537 --> 00:38:05,552
and yet I could keep up with
a supercharged Jaguar XKR

631
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:09,335
because I had better brakes.

632
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:11,872
I'd look at him getting to the
end of the Hangar Straight,

633
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:15,562
thinking, "Why are you braking now,
you idiot? You don't need to."

634
00:38:16,897 --> 00:38:21,055
And that is
this car's party piece.

635
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:23,272
To show you
how well this car stops,

636
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:25,762
I've organised a little test.

637
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:33,122
Right, I'm currently driving
alongside a Jaguar F Type...

638
00:38:34,017 --> 00:38:35,352
at 100 miles an hour.

639
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:38,442
When we get to that
cone down there...

640
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:42,522
we're both going to brake.

641
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:46,537
Ready?

642
00:39:02,457 --> 00:39:06,242
How can you stop from 100 miles an
hour to nothing in that distance?

643
00:39:09,737 --> 00:39:13,935
So, it stops like
it's run into a wall...

644
00:39:14,017 --> 00:39:17,402
it's pressed into
the road by witchcraft...

645
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:21,242
it weighs the same
as a bag of whippets...

646
00:39:22,377 --> 00:39:26,775
and it has nearly
800 horsepower on tap.

647
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:30,802
Put all that together
and... um, well...

648
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:38,122
Oh, my giddy aunt!

649
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:49,802
It doesn't have
the savagery of the P1.

650
00:39:50,377 --> 00:39:52,895
The P1 was so scary,

651
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:57,055
it took me two months
to get used to it,

652
00:39:57,137 --> 00:40:00,015
to discover
its little foibles.

653
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:04,815
This, though, even though
I'm now in hunkered-down,

654
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:06,992
tightened-up,
vicious race mode,

655
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:10,482
with the traction control
wound right back,

656
00:40:11,297 --> 00:40:13,255
I'm not frightened at all.

657
00:40:13,337 --> 00:40:16,392
I'm starting to push the
envelope after 20 minutes.

658
00:40:23,477 --> 00:40:27,589
But you see, through there, the
P1 would have understeered.

659
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:29,915
This just doesn't because

660
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:33,309
there's no weight
to push it out of line.

661
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:38,067
It's like you're driving
using nothing but telepathy.

662
00:40:46,597 --> 00:40:49,347
And I'm loving it!

663
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,949
In the past, I've
described various Ferraris

664
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,096
as feeling
beautifully delicate.

665
00:40:58,245 --> 00:41:02,266
But compared to this,
they're like elephants!

666
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:07,940
Criticisms?

667
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:11,241
Not many, I mean,
the usual McLaren stuff.

668
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:14,631
When you try to change it from
comfort to track to sport to race,

669
00:41:14,713 --> 00:41:17,117
it's all far too complicated.

670
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:22,151
And I know they saved 15 kilograms
not fitting air conditioning,

671
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:26,749
but on a hot day like today,
it's quite sweaty.

672
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,789
But who cares?

673
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:45,269
Honestly, this thing is rewriting
the supercar rule book, in my mind.

674
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,237
Unbelievable car, that.

675
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,511
I'm actually proud
to be British with that.

676
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:07,919
What?

677
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,277
- Yes, definitely.
- What?

678
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,471
Well, just... while the film was on
we've just been online and checked.

679
00:42:15,553 --> 00:42:18,271
Thruxton is not
the fastest track in Europe.

680
00:42:18,353 --> 00:42:20,117
- What?
- It's not.

681
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:22,997
- Why isn't it?
- Well, it isn't the fastest track.

682
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,871
Well, it's the fastest
racetrack in Wiltshire.

683
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:25,661
It's in Hampshire.

684
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:27,279
- You don't even know...
- It's in Hampshire.

685
00:42:27,357 --> 00:42:29,433
- You don't know where it is.
- You don't even know that!

686
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:33,921
They described themselves as the
fastest track in the South of England.

687
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:35,412
- Not Europe.
- After Brexit

688
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,272
- it'll be the fastest in Europe.
- Right.

689
00:42:37,397 --> 00:42:39,237
Anyway, whatever,
back to your film.

690
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:41,751
You said "rewriting
the supercar rule book".

691
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,597
Those are big words.

692
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,037
Yeah, and they're correct.

693
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,376
- Are they?
- No, they are.

694
00:42:46,454 --> 00:42:47,985
No, for once,
I am actually...

695
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:49,791
First time this show
I'm right.

696
00:42:49,877 --> 00:42:54,321
Because that car... You remember the
Lamborghini Huracán Performante?

697
00:42:54,399 --> 00:42:56,877
- I loved that car.
- OK, that blitzed our track.

698
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:59,671
Absolutely blitzed it, fastest
road car ever round there.

699
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:02,877
I can guarantee
the Senna will be quicker.

700
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:05,471
- Guaran...
- Here we go again. Good.

701
00:43:05,553 --> 00:43:07,151
I promise it will be.

702
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:08,397
I promise.

703
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:10,631
If it isn't, can we blow up
your house?

704
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,797
I haven't finished
building it yet.

705
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:16,111
Well, when you've finished
building it, can we blow it up?

706
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,037
Yes.

707
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:21,733
No, I am so confident
the Senna will be faster,

708
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:23,858
that if it isn't,
when I've finished

709
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:25,295
building my house, you
can blow it up again.

710
00:43:25,373 --> 00:43:27,957
You do know that we will?
We will do that.

711
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,191
- We will do that.
- We will.

712
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,709
We'll wait till you're in.

713
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,151
Let's play the tape, come on.
Let's have a look.

714
00:43:36,233 --> 00:43:38,597
There's Abby, and she's off,

715
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:41,277
flying away from the line
like a stabbed rat.

716
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,351
And coming onto
the Isn't Straight.

717
00:43:43,433 --> 00:43:47,717
Already carrying
some serious speed.

718
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:50,597
Looking busy at the wheel on the
bumpy surface of our track,

719
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,711
but those hydraulically interconnected
dampers are doing their job

720
00:43:53,793 --> 00:43:56,109
of keeping it all tied down.

721
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:59,077
Oh, that is flying!

722
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:01,871
She's already dropping down
into Your Name Here.

723
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:05,837
Some squeal from
the Pirelli P Zero Trofeos

724
00:44:05,919 --> 00:44:08,511
as she carves round there
and then it's back on the gas

725
00:44:08,593 --> 00:44:11,637
to unleash
that mighty twin turbo V8

726
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:13,591
for the return run
down to the Isn't.

727
00:44:13,673 --> 00:44:17,037
I am feeling confident here!

728
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,871
Right, now hard on those
incredible carbon ceramic brakes

729
00:44:19,953 --> 00:44:24,351
for the tight, and technical,
Old Lady's House.

730
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:28,317
No excess weight
to drag the nose wide.

731
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,197
And now, on the fast run
to Substation,

732
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:33,711
riding the ruts
and lumps with ease.

733
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:35,717
Two corners left.

734
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:38,111
More tyre squeal
through there,

735
00:44:38,193 --> 00:44:40,117
rear wing
doing its thing.

736
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,911
And now a bit of oversteer
and across the line.

737
00:44:44,713 --> 00:44:47,351
Looks good,
it does look good.

738
00:44:47,433 --> 00:44:48,519
But...

739
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:52,334
Got everything we need
to blow it up?

740
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:54,151
There it is, there's the
Huracán Performante.

741
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,037
1.16.8.

742
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:58,157
And I have guaranteed
it'll be faster

743
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,557
or you'll blow
my house up.

744
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:02,231
And you're doing well on facts
this week, so far, aren't you?

745
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:04,037
How are you feeling?

746
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,837
- Totally relaxed.
- Are you really?

747
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,157
Thing is, we haven't got far
to go to blow it up, have we?

748
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:12,471
It's just gonna be
over there.

749
00:45:12,553 --> 00:45:15,149
Come on, let's see
how fast it was.

750
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:17,751
Oh, oh...

751
00:45:19,873 --> 00:45:23,069
- Damn!
- 1:12!

752
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:25,429
That is serious.

753
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,877
That's four
seconds quicker.

754
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:32,671
That's quicker than the Vulcan, and
the Vulcan isn't even road legal.

755
00:45:32,753 --> 00:45:34,917
That's absolutely amazing.

756
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:38,031
That is astonishing and we can add it
to the list of things that you know.

757
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,957
- Anyway, we must now get back to our film.
- Yes.

758
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:47,111
Earlier on, we decided
that Detroit should be

759
00:45:47,193 --> 00:45:49,837
a big sort of
petrolhead theme park,

760
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:53,311
so we went over there with
three tuned muscle cars.

761
00:45:53,393 --> 00:45:57,237
So far we've staged a drag
race, done some doughnuts

762
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:59,791
and Jeremy has driven over
some vegetables.

763
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:04,974
And then the next day, we decided that
what Detroit really needs is a racetrack.

764
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:07,357
Yeah, even though
it already has two.

765
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:09,431
Yes, but we wanted
something more earthy.

766
00:46:09,513 --> 00:46:12,709
So we headed
for the city centre.

767
00:46:31,399 --> 00:46:34,357
As we headed
for the downtown area,

768
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:38,469
I decided to do a bit of
muscle car housekeeping.

769
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:42,711
Can I just ask everybody what
your average fuel consumption

770
00:46:42,793 --> 00:46:45,711
has been
since we got to Detroit?

771
00:46:45,793 --> 00:46:49,614
Overall, over the whole trip,
eight mpg.

772
00:46:49,696 --> 00:46:54,069
Yeah, mine is a healthy
3.9 miles per gallon.

773
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:56,671
You're joking? 3.9?

774
00:46:56,753 --> 00:46:58,989
Yes, siree Bob.

775
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:02,831
13 mpg from the Mustang.

776
00:47:02,913 --> 00:47:05,271
Is it a hybrid?

777
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,511
If it had been a hybrid, it
would have fitted in very well

778
00:47:11,593 --> 00:47:15,949
with what the centre of Detroit
has become these days.

779
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,437
Florist... cafés...

780
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,071
Oh, for heaven's sake,
Urban Ramen!

781
00:47:25,153 --> 00:47:27,869
No, no, no, no!

782
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:33,717
In 1997,
in downtown Detroit,

783
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:36,951
someone put a gun
against my head.

784
00:47:37,033 --> 00:47:42,637
Now it's just all hipsters
with dogs and bicycles.

785
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:46,589
If you want to start a tech business,
bugger off to San Francisco.

786
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:51,831
Oh, for God's sake, have you
seen this little urban garden?

787
00:47:51,913 --> 00:47:54,357
Oh, no.

788
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:56,837
Why has he got such
a problem with gardens?

789
00:47:56,919 --> 00:47:59,111
Look down there,
it's just all greenhouses

790
00:47:59,193 --> 00:48:02,629
full of little
artisan... soaps.

791
00:48:02,707 --> 00:48:04,025
There's a Tesla!

792
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:07,000
There's a bloody Tesla
in Detroit!

793
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:09,471
If only the world were full of
people like Jeremy Clarkson.

794
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,237
Then we could have
slavery and witch burning.

795
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,631
Right, well, we've
established one thing.

796
00:48:14,713 --> 00:48:17,911
The centre of Detroit...
that ain't a racetrack,

797
00:48:17,993 --> 00:48:19,934
that's a wholefood market.

798
00:48:20,016 --> 00:48:23,389
We need to get out of here,
this is the enemy.

799
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,431
Having returned to
the rundown suburbs,

800
00:48:29,513 --> 00:48:34,309
we eventually found the perfect
place to build a racetrack:

801
00:48:36,919 --> 00:48:40,669
Cadillac's old
Conner Avenue Factory.

802
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,511
For over 60 years, they stamped
out the body panels here

803
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:50,631
for icons, like
the Eldorado, the Fleetwood,

804
00:48:50,713 --> 00:48:53,429
and the Coupe de Ville.

805
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:59,271
If it were up to James,
this creaking monument

806
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:04,229
to the Motor City's decline would
be turned into a shrubbery.

807
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:08,077
But it wasn't up to James.

808
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:11,871
So it would become a Monte
Carlo-style tunnel feature

809
00:49:11,953 --> 00:49:15,349
on our Detroit-themed
racetrack.

810
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:19,791
Right, so what I
thought we'd do is

811
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,471
we'd name all of the corners
and all of the straights

812
00:49:22,553 --> 00:49:25,837
after various musicians
who are from Detroit.

813
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:30,957
So, for example, put that there, and
then this would be Alice Cooper Corner.

814
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:33,191
- Yeah, nice touch.
- And I've got all the faces.

815
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:36,237
I've got Glenn Frey from the
Eagles, Jack White, Madonna,

816
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,071
Aretha Franklin, Bob Seger,
Ted Nugent.

817
00:49:38,153 --> 00:49:39,591
What's that stick for?

818
00:49:39,673 --> 00:49:42,717
Oh, that's um...
that's Iggy pop.

819
00:49:42,799 --> 00:49:45,071
- Oh, yeah, it's like he's here.
- Yeah, exactly.

820
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:48,077
Then as we go into
the back section over there,

821
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:51,631
you've got Marvin Gaye, Stevie
Wonder, Eminem, Diana Ross,

822
00:49:51,713 --> 00:49:54,317
Sonny Bono, Martha Reeves,

823
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:56,485
Anthony Kiedis,
Smokey Robinson.

824
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:58,297
You look in the book
and you just go...

825
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:00,578
"They can't all be
from Detroit!"

826
00:50:01,102 --> 00:50:03,094
Did you know Madonna
was from Detroit?

827
00:50:03,172 --> 00:50:04,658
No.

828
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,524
Because building the track
involved heavy machinery

829
00:50:10,602 --> 00:50:12,078
and manual labour,

830
00:50:12,227 --> 00:50:16,349
Hammond insisted on
doing everything himself.

831
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:21,521
That is gonna be
a fast corner.

832
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:27,829
Despite this, though,
he soon had everything ready.

833
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,911
Sadly, though, he had got
a bit confused about

834
00:50:39,993 --> 00:50:43,149
naming the corners
after local musicians.

835
00:50:46,045 --> 00:50:47,490
- What?
- Why have you...

836
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:48,601
 Why have you got The Edge?

837
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:50,880
Well, you said there was
Sonny Bono.

838
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,904
Yes, Hammond, Sonny Bono

839
00:50:52,982 --> 00:50:56,383
and The Edge from the famous
Detroit rock band U2.

840
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:58,119
Exactly.

841
00:51:00,465 --> 00:51:05,094
Because the track had been built by the
world's most accident-prone driver,

842
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:08,871
we thought it best that
the God-fearing Exorcist

843
00:51:08,953 --> 00:51:10,551
should christen it.

844
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:21,399
So bumpy!

845
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:26,873
What the hell is this?

846
00:51:33,994 --> 00:51:37,184
What's that, some sort of
chicane he's put in there?

847
00:51:38,959 --> 00:51:42,631
Whoa, slippery,
that's slippery as hell!

848
00:51:42,713 --> 00:51:46,591
What? That...
That's unbelievably narrow!

849
00:51:46,673 --> 00:51:49,389
What's he thinking of?

850
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:55,110
Oh, hello.

851
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:59,109
Here he comes.

852
00:52:01,215 --> 00:52:06,613
After his run, James couldn't wait to
give Hammond some constructive feedback.

853
00:52:06,784 --> 00:52:10,037
I just wanna say, Hammond,
you witless dishcloth!

854
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:12,597
That is the worst racetrack
I've ever been round.

855
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:16,628
It's slippery, it's full of holes, it's
full of obstacles for you to crash into.

856
00:52:16,753 --> 00:52:18,651
- It's narrow.
- It's challenging, isn't it? Technical.

857
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:21,311
It's not challenging. It's only
about that much bigger than the car

858
00:52:21,393 --> 00:52:22,871
and it's made of butter.

859
00:52:22,953 --> 00:52:26,637
And... it appears to be
full of asbestos waste.

860
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:28,357
Oh, it is full
of asbestos.

861
00:52:28,439 --> 00:52:30,231
- Sorry about that.
- Well, thank you!

862
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,469
Close your window.

863
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,711
All of us then
set about our practice laps,

864
00:52:40,793 --> 00:52:43,557
on Hammond's death trap.

865
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:45,471
Thin bit! Oh, God!

866
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:49,869
I can't see a bloody thing.

867
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,391
My own car doesn't fit
round my own racetrack!

868
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:58,469
What have I done?

869
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,391
Despite the peril, though,

870
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,629
we gave it everything.

871
00:53:06,959 --> 00:53:08,711
And by the end
of the session,

872
00:53:08,793 --> 00:53:13,669
there was nothing in it between
The Demon and the Exorcist.

873
00:53:14,919 --> 00:53:19,029
The Mustang, though, that
was in a league of its own.

874
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,749
♪ I'm not gonna take it
any more ♪

875
00:53:30,865 --> 00:53:32,305
56.4.

876
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:36,727
Yes, you're fastest.

877
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:37,991
Well, of course
it's the fastest,

878
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:40,549
it's a muscle car
that handles.

879
00:53:41,507 --> 00:53:45,665
However, these were just
unofficial practice laps.

880
00:53:45,743 --> 00:53:48,055
Now it was time
for the one-shot,

881
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:51,329
winner-takes-all real thing.

882
00:53:52,393 --> 00:53:55,397
In three, two, one...

883
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:58,469
Begin!

884
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:07,069
Brakes for that bit.
Bit of downshift.

885
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:20,991
Massive bump.

886
00:54:21,073 --> 00:54:22,719
Oh, God!

887
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:28,959
Hammond.

888
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:32,799
Slippery.

889
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:39,429
And here he is.
Here he comes.

890
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,989
- I've pooed myself.
- Funny noise.

891
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:51,509
However, the trouser
accident had clearly been worth it.

892
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:54,031
You've just broken
your own record.

893
00:54:54,113 --> 00:54:57,111
- That's remarkable cos...
- 59.66.

894
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,677
- Really?
- Yeah.

895
00:54:58,759 --> 00:55:00,751
I'm happy with that and I haven't
hit any famous musicians

896
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:03,389
or bits of old car factory.

897
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:08,429
Next it was
the turn of Corporal Crash.

898
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:11,831
Where's the
fire engine gone?

899
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:14,151
Fire engine's over there,
ambulance is...

900
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:16,111
Oh, we're all comedians
today.

901
00:55:16,193 --> 00:55:19,757
Remember,
if you lose to James May...

902
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:22,949
It's more humiliating,
It's worse than death.

903
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:26,549
In three, two, one, go.

904
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:32,357
Looking for grip.

905
00:55:32,439 --> 00:55:34,351
Turn in neat, crisp
by The Edge. Whoa!

906
00:55:36,439 --> 00:55:38,071
Oh, he's gone
over The Edge!

907
00:55:38,153 --> 00:55:41,149
Again.

908
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,717
Oh-oh.

909
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,831
- Hammond's lap's going well.
- Yeah, isn't it?

910
00:55:48,313 --> 00:55:51,109
So which corner is that
he's gone off on?

911
00:55:51,479 --> 00:55:54,309
I mean, obviously it is him.

912
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:57,189
Amazingly, it wasn't.

913
00:56:03,879 --> 00:56:07,389
Is that Madonna?
That's Madonna. I dunno.

914
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:10,189
Now we're in the open.

915
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:14,109
Oh, Christ!

916
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:18,709
Yes, no, Beelzebub's got
a bit of understeer there.

917
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:25,269
That felt good.
It felt like a quick one.

918
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,511
Ah, I don't know
how to put this to you but...

919
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,471
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

920
00:56:36,553 --> 00:56:41,189
Point four of a second
slower than James May!

921
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:42,991
This is what death
feels like.

922
00:56:43,073 --> 00:56:44,557
OK, get out of the Demon,

923
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:46,351
we've done the Demon
and The Exorcist.

924
00:56:46,433 --> 00:56:49,149
It's time for the Blue Nun.

925
00:56:49,399 --> 00:56:50,911
- Blue Nun?
- Yeah.

926
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:57,231
Totally pointless
waste of time this.

927
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:03,214
We've established the Mustang is
the fastest by an enormous margin.

928
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:07,189
Um... I'd better go and do it,
I suppose.

929
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,311
Jeremy smug in My
Little Pony. Are you ready?

930
00:57:12,393 --> 00:57:16,589
In three, two, one, begin!

931
00:57:22,999 --> 00:57:24,119
Ohh, yes!

932
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:27,231
This is a properly
sorted track car.

933
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:30,349
That's what
we're looking at here.

934
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:32,591
Properly sorted it may be.

935
00:57:32,673 --> 00:57:36,869
But I had a plan that
would spoil its afternoon.

936
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:39,631
- You're running!
- I know, but you'll see.

937
00:57:39,713 --> 00:57:42,429
Gotta get down to this corner
before he gets back.

938
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:44,157
Help me tip this over.

939
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:46,231
- What is it?
- It's organic palm oil.

940
00:57:46,313 --> 00:57:47,717
Very slippery.

941
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:50,429
It's the revenge
of the urban farmer.

942
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:57,069
Into the blind bend.
There is Stevie Wonder.

943
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:01,391
You do know it's palm oil that's ruining
life for the world's orangutans?

944
00:58:01,473 --> 00:58:03,157
Only this one.

945
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:05,717
Come on, come on.

946
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:08,069
Short shifting into third.

947
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:14,509
Ohhh!

948
00:58:14,919 --> 00:58:16,631
And on that terrible
disappointment...

949
00:58:16,713 --> 00:58:19,429
- For him.
- It's back to the tent.

950
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:26,757
- You!
- What?

951
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:29,831
- I thought it had been you.
- Oh, no.

952
00:58:29,913 --> 00:58:31,517
You ruined my lap.

953
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,717
You said Detroit
had to be a playground

954
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,551
and that's what I was doing,
I was playing.

955
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:39,197
Listen,
can my practice time stand?

956
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:40,911
Cos that was still
the quickest.

957
00:58:40,993 --> 00:58:43,037
That's not how it works.

958
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,351
You can't just say that because you
were the quickest in qualifying,

959
00:58:45,433 --> 00:58:47,631
you would have won the race
if you hadn't crashed.

960
00:58:47,713 --> 00:58:49,757
- Well, I can say it.
- You can say it.

961
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,191
I could say I'm the captain
of the English cricket team.

962
00:58:51,273 --> 00:58:53,511
I wouldn't be any good at it.

963
00:58:56,919 --> 00:58:58,837
Ah, well, moving on.

964
00:58:58,919 --> 00:59:00,951
I know where
he was going with that.

965
00:59:01,033 --> 00:59:03,957
Anyway, look,
in part one of that film,

966
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:07,911
we said that we would have a race
between the Demon and The Exorcist,

967
00:59:07,993 --> 00:59:09,477
a drag race, yeah?

968
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:11,551
And then it never happened.

969
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:13,437
Except it did.

970
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:18,077
Yeah. You see, Dodge said we
couldn't drag race it on the street.

971
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:20,871
But they didn't say
anything about airfields.

972
00:59:20,953 --> 00:59:24,677
So after we'd finished at our
track, we found one of those.

973
00:59:24,759 --> 00:59:26,991
I bowed out of this,
like I said, cos the Mustang

974
00:59:27,073 --> 00:59:29,557
in a drag racing environment's
never gonna win.

975
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:33,311
It became a two-horse race between
Sir Crashalot and the Onanist, OK?

976
00:59:33,393 --> 00:59:36,237
But we have a problem.

977
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,671
See, we only have time left in the show,
realistically, for one more thing.

978
00:59:39,753 --> 00:59:42,551
We've got the guest segment.
This week I should tell you,

979
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:46,669
it's between Howard
from the Halifax adverts...

980
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,117
and Adrian Chiles,

981
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:54,669
to find the fastest person you don't
really hear from much any more.

982
00:59:57,039 --> 00:59:59,031
We'll have a vote, I think.

983
00:59:59,113 --> 01:00:03,029
Who here would like to see
the celebrity segment?

984
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:08,637
There's one over there.

985
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:10,351
And who'd like to see
the drag race?

986
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:15,831
- Does that mean they're not coming on?
- Very much so, James.

987
01:00:15,913 --> 01:00:19,949
So here it is, then, the race
between good and evil.

988
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:35,431
Right, here we go, viewers.

989
01:00:35,513 --> 01:00:40,309
It's either salvation or a world
plunged into eternal darkness.

990
01:00:45,759 --> 01:00:49,677
OK, this is it: the race
between good and evil.

991
01:00:49,759 --> 01:00:51,471
Are we ready, gentlemen?

992
01:00:51,553 --> 01:00:54,269
- We ready?
- No.

993
01:00:55,879 --> 01:00:57,437
What's happening?

994
01:00:57,519 --> 01:00:59,631
I've got a couple of things
to do before we start.

995
01:00:59,713 --> 01:01:02,494
Are you saying you can't
just drag race this now?

996
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:06,509
Well, you've gotta do it properly,
this is a proper drag racing car!

997
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,277
What is he doing?

998
01:01:08,359 --> 01:01:10,431
This is what you get
when you buy a Demon.

999
01:01:10,513 --> 01:01:13,789
Costs you an extra dollar
and you get this crate.

1000
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:16,197
Oh-ho-ho!

1001
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:17,911
It's like a picnic hamper
for men.

1002
01:01:17,993 --> 01:01:20,917
Then, underneath,
and to either side,

1003
01:01:20,999 --> 01:01:23,631
I've got boxes with the new
EC - I've everything I need.

1004
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:25,311
- ECU?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1005
01:01:25,393 --> 01:01:28,109
Look at that!

1006
01:01:33,113 --> 01:01:36,911
He's got this enormous crate
and some bags

1007
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:40,317
and tins... full of tools,

1008
01:01:40,399 --> 01:01:42,997
with two space savers and...

1009
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:44,511
Space saver wheels?

1010
01:01:44,593 --> 01:01:45,917
Hang on.

1011
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:48,397
Why are you putting
space savers on it?

1012
01:01:48,479 --> 01:01:50,471
They're drag racing
tyres, they're lighter.

1013
01:01:50,553 --> 01:01:53,757
I don't need grip at
the front, just got to steer.

1014
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,391
What else does he have to
do, apart from change the wheels?

1015
01:01:56,473 --> 01:01:59,909
Um... he's got
a new ECU to fit.

1016
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:01,511
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1017
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:03,951
So it's not really
a drag racing car at all?

1018
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:08,149
It will be once he's
completely rebuilt it.

1019
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:15,711
This is an old-fashioned view of television
but I think we've lost the moment.

1020
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:19,111
I think I agree with you. This was
gonna be the big end of the show,

1021
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,511
good versus evil.

1022
01:02:20,593 --> 01:02:23,477
I could have walked
to the end by now.

1023
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:27,471
I've gotta take back tyre
pressures down to 20 psi.

1024
01:02:27,553 --> 01:02:30,951
Nice fat,
squishy contact patch.

1025
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:41,429
Exactly 25 minutes so far it's taken
him to do his quarter-mile run.

1026
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:44,511
Oh, so, this is where it
breathes through its eye.

1027
01:02:44,593 --> 01:02:47,869
Look at that! That goes
at the back of its eye.

1028
01:02:48,879 --> 01:02:50,717
So...

1029
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,951
Hammond, that is a significant component.
What is it?

1030
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:55,917
- Air filter.
- Does it not have an air filter?

1031
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,869
Yeah, but this is a performance one.
It's gonna gulp through air.

1032
01:03:05,279 --> 01:03:07,671
- Right, so that's it, good.
- Now I've gotta do the ECU.

1033
01:03:07,753 --> 01:03:11,237
Which goes in here, I believe.
I'll have to take that out.

1034
01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:15,614
So he's now got a different ECU just
telling the engine to be powerful.

1035
01:03:15,696 --> 01:03:19,069
Right, why didn't they just
put that in from the start?

1036
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:21,471
That's good to go.

1037
01:03:21,553 --> 01:03:24,757
Sadly, though, it wasn't.

1038
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:28,471
He's now refuelling his car with
a special... How many octane?

1039
01:03:28,553 --> 01:03:32,629
It's ethanol and gasoline
mixture... um... 104.

1040
01:03:33,399 --> 01:03:36,309
After the refuelling,
we hoped he was done.

1041
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:38,477
But, no.

1042
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:39,951
Right, hang on a minute.
I've got to put it

1043
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:41,917
in neutral to get
that in the middle.

1044
01:03:41,999 --> 01:03:44,031
Hammond, you're taking
the whole dashboard off.

1045
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:47,391
This has to come out because I'm gonna
put in a new control panel here.

1046
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:48,917
I get a new button on it.

1047
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:52,391
He's taking the whole centre
console out, the whole of that.

1048
01:03:52,473 --> 01:03:55,311
He's had to put it in
neutral to lift it all off.

1049
01:03:55,393 --> 01:03:56,677
What for?

1050
01:03:56,759 --> 01:03:58,991
Because you can then fit
a button, that enables him

1051
01:03:59,073 --> 01:04:02,677
to select what sort of fuel
he's running on.

1052
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:05,391
Why don't they just put
that in from the start?

1053
01:04:05,473 --> 01:04:09,957
This all goes back in here,
with my new switch gear in.

1054
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:12,117
It's an hour
and seven minutes.

1055
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:14,591
Actually, you're right,
it is. It's over an hour now.

1056
01:04:14,673 --> 01:04:16,237
God!

1057
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,069
There we go.

1058
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:25,414
Finally, the rebuild
of the Demon was complete.

1059
01:04:25,496 --> 01:04:29,309
It was time for the drivers
to warm their tyres.

1060
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,951
In three, two, one, burn out!

1061
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:50,317
Right, your tyres are warm.
Are you now ready?

1062
01:04:50,399 --> 01:04:53,511
- What?
- Are you ready to come to the start line?

1063
01:04:53,593 --> 01:04:55,517
- No!
- What do you mean, no?

1064
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,311
- No, that was just a celebratory burnout.
- Oh, jeez, he's got out.

1065
01:04:58,393 --> 01:05:00,911
I've done all the building work,
now I've gotta set the car up.

1066
01:05:00,993 --> 01:05:03,437
I've gotta get in the right
modes, there's stuff to do, mate.

1067
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:05,151
Oh, I've had enough.
I'm sorry, I've had enough.

1068
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:06,957
Bye.

1069
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:09,749
We're never gonna do this.

1070
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:13,877
So, I need to go into Drag.
Drag Mode Activating.

1071
01:05:13,959 --> 01:05:16,271
Excellent. Drag Transmission,
Drag Traction, Power.

1072
01:05:16,353 --> 01:05:20,397
So Power
needs to go up to 840.

1073
01:05:20,479 --> 01:05:22,271
We are now in High Octane.

1074
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:23,717
Ho-ho!

1075
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,597
I've never known
anything like it.

1076
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:27,917
With our starter
on his way back to London,

1077
01:05:27,999 --> 01:05:29,431
the traffic lights
were brought in,

1078
01:05:29,513 --> 01:05:33,309
and finally
we were ready to go.

1079
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:39,429
I'm gonna bust your ass,
evil boy!

1080
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:41,037
Oh, yes.

1081
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,631
What are you gonna
do with it now?

1082
01:05:42,713 --> 01:05:45,269
Cos I've seen the film
and I wouldn't do it.

1083
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:07,951
I'm getting ahead!
I think I'm getting ahead!

1084
01:06:08,033 --> 01:06:10,429
Come on, Demon!

1085
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:19,869
Argh, so annoying!

1086
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:24,277
Urghh!

1087
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,197
Aha! Evil wins!

1088
01:06:27,279 --> 01:06:29,909
Evil wins! Woo-hoo!

1089
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:37,271
Ye-e-e-s!

1090
01:06:37,353 --> 01:06:38,877
Yes!

1091
01:06:38,959 --> 01:06:40,743
Victory for the Demon.

1092
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:42,501
Thank you. Ha-ha!

1093
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:44,759
- Cos I won.
- Yes, you won.

1094
01:06:44,884 --> 01:06:47,037
- You did win. Well done.
- You noticed, then?

1095
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,142
- Yes, I noticed it.
- That I won?

1096
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,902
At the end of
the race, my car

1097
01:06:50,033 --> 01:06:52,197
was in front of your car,
which means I won.

1098
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:54,791
Can I just point out, first
you had to spend half a day

1099
01:06:54,873 --> 01:06:57,951
rebuilding half your car, and
then you had to run it on fuel

1100
01:06:58,033 --> 01:07:00,791
that you can't buy from
a normal petrol station.

1101
01:07:00,873 --> 01:07:06,160
Wait a minute, your Excrement runs
on that clever fuel all the time.

1102
01:07:06,871 --> 01:07:08,734
I was sort of banking on
you not knowing that.

1103
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,324
- Yes, well, I do know.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

1104
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:14,957
I think we have to agree,
the Mustang is the only car

1105
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,557
here that ticks
all the muscle car boxes.

1106
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:20,837
It's cheap, it's powerful,
it runs on fuel you can buy,

1107
01:07:20,919 --> 01:07:23,871
and you can have it with the
steering wheel on the correct side.

1108
01:07:23,953 --> 01:07:26,355
You don't get it, do you?
You just don't get it.

1109
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:28,715
A muscle car is supposed to
have 1,000 horsepower,

1110
01:07:28,913 --> 01:07:31,437
be undriveable
and have a stupid name.

1111
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:33,877
It's called Ready To Rock!
That is a stupid name!

1112
01:07:33,959 --> 01:07:37,074
Listen, Hammond, not only are you the
fiscal brain of this operation...

1113
01:07:37,152 --> 01:07:38,168
I am.

1114
01:07:38,246 --> 01:07:41,606
- You're also the resident
muscle car enthusiast. -  yes?

1115
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:45,098
So, and I know the answer to this, cos you
told me on the plane on the way home.

1116
01:07:45,176 --> 01:07:46,928
Of the three cars, which
would you actually buy?

1117
01:07:47,108 --> 01:07:48,312
- Buy?
- Buy.

1118
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:49,622
- With my own money?
- Yes.

1119
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,624
- Buy? Myself?
- Yes. Yes.

1120
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:54,511
- It's the Mustang.
- There you go, the Mustang.

1121
01:07:54,593 --> 01:07:57,431
And so on that terrible
disappointment for you...

1122
01:07:57,513 --> 01:08:01,012
Snowflakes. -...it's time...
it's time to end.

1123
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:04,105
Now, next week it
is a Grand Tour Special,

1124
01:08:04,238 --> 01:08:08,277
where we attempt to become the
first ever television show

1125
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:09,951
in the history of television

1126
01:08:10,033 --> 01:08:13,271
to go to Colombia
and not use the C-word.

1127
01:08:13,613 --> 01:08:16,069
See you then. Goodbye.
