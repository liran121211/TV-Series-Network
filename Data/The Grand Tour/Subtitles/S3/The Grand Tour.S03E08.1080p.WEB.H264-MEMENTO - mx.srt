2
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:59,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

3
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:02,070
Thank you.

4
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:03,796
Thank you very much,
everyone.

5
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:08,882
Now, welcome to what is
a Grand Tour special,

6
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,843
in which we go on vacation.

7
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:13,499
Yep. Let me explain.

8
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:14,983
The other day
we were wondering

9
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:19,038
why some people who want to
visit the western bit of America,

10
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:23,069
choose to do so on
an RV touring holiday.

11
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:25,936
It is very popular. I mean, we
all have friends who have done it.

12
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,624
And they say
they had a good time.

13
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,608
Sounds like caravanning
to us, though.

14
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:31,577
And you couldn't enjoy that...

15
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:34,007
unless you were mental.
However,

16
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:37,230
Mr Wilman says that since
this is a motoring,

17
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:39,070
and travel
and adventure show

18
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:41,030
he would rent us an RV.

19
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:43,046
And then we could
go over there

20
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:46,975
to see if we could find
out what the appeal is.

21
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:56,772
This was
the location he chose.

22
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:04,835
And this was the Winnebago
Chieftain that he rented for us.

23
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:08,616
And it was
very terrible in every way.

24
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,132
Chaps,
if you'd like to brace,

25
00:02:12,218 --> 00:02:15,110
I'm gonna put my foot down,
see what she'll do. Happy?

26
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,140
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- Here we go.

27
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:22,546
40.

28
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:26,874
43.

29
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:30,405
That's flat-out.

30
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:34,830
This slowness put
Hammond and me in a bad mood.

31
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:37,310
You're just helping yourself
to cards. I...

32
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:39,810
I thought that was the idea.
Gotta find all the cards...

33
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:41,850
I have to have
a turn as well.

34
00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:43,670
Well, that'll take ages.

35
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:45,610
Don't make my holiday worse
than it already is.

36
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:47,930
- It is pretty
bad in here, isn't it?

37
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:50,250
It's worse
than I thought it would be.

38
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:53,698
Who decided, "Yes, that wallpaper
makes it look like home"?

39
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:57,199
This material existed...

40
00:02:57,398 --> 00:03:00,550
in the late-1960s
in South Yorkshire.

41
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:02,930
It's called pleblon
that we're sitting on.

42
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:05,581
And this - this is vulgalure.

43
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,370
RV design,
as far as I can tell,

44
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,151
stopped in 1972.

45
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:12,270
Yes.

46
00:03:12,355 --> 00:03:13,890
It's a different
design language

47
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:15,930
and the language is: Shit.

48
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:19,170
But all of this
doesn't trouble me

49
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:22,495
half as much as that.

50
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:23,979
We're here for a week.

51
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:27,925
At no point will
we be more than 12 feet

52
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:30,330
from where
the turds are stored.

53
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:32,480
His turds.

54
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,058
Look at this.

55
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:37,890
That's the lavatory door.

56
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:40,526
Look at it.
This is unacceptable.

57
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:42,839
What separates
us from the animals

58
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,470
is reason
and defecating in private.

59
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:50,790
You go somewhere comfortable, read
a newspaper, do your business.

60
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,590
You can't do that in there.

61
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,950
- What is
that shocking racket?

62
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:58,010
- Everything.
- Everything rattles because it's full of crap.

63
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:02,690
I'm not... I can't...
I can't do a week in here.

64
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:08,330
After just five miles
we'd had enough.

65
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,910
And pulled over
for a cup of American coffee.

66
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:16,050
Right. Recipe's very simple. Take
a coffee bean and razor blade.

67
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:18,810
Chop just the end off.
Lovely.

68
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:20,833
Let's check the...

69
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,394
Lukewarm? Yeah.

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,472
Pop it in.

71
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:26,448
Mix it up
till the water is

72
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:29,214
just slightly coloured.

73
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,308
- Perfect.
- So in conclusion, then,

74
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:33,730
there is no appeal
to an RV holiday, is there?

75
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:37,909
This whole experience
wouldn't be so bad

76
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:41,550
if we somehow could modify
it, so it's better to live in.

77
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:43,610
Well, only if
we could have one each.

78
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:45,581
Well, why don't we do that?

79
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:47,895
Get one each? Yeah, why
don't we just get one each?

80
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,167
And then modify it to suit
our particular requirements.

81
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:53,144
We don't have to have
all of this offensive...

82
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,823
We can do what we want.

83
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:58,472
We therefore
abandoned Mr Wilman's RV

84
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:01,065
and went off to buy our own.

85
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:06,440
Which we then personalised to
suit our individual holiday needs.

86
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,490
This is what I've gone for.

87
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,250
It's the Ford F550
National Tropical.

88
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:18,150
And... it's 36 feet long.

89
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,870
Why so massive?

90
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:21,690
I wanted to modify it
in such a way

91
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:24,110
that I brought a small
taste of home with me.

92
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:26,290
- Can you guess what it is?
- Er...

93
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,170
- Brown furniture.
- A tea cosy.

94
00:05:28,255 --> 00:05:29,810
- A rusty motorcycle.
- No.

95
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,520
- Follow me.
- What?

96
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:35,151
Holy moly!

97
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:36,369
Whoa-ho!

98
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:38,667
Yes, welcome to the Rack and Pinion.
What will it be?

99
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:41,714
- I'm in a pub.
- I'm staggered.

100
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,129
It's got peanuts on
the wall, terrible pictures.

101
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:46,151
- Yes.
- This is fabulous.

102
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:48,151
- I know.
- Warm brown beer.

103
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:50,852
Yep. Would you like
a glass of Lady Petrol?

104
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,885
- Is that rosé? Lady Petrol?
- Yes. I've equipped it with your favourite drinks.

105
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:57,394
- What's that?
- That's for you.

106
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:58,776
Brummie's Ruin.

107
00:05:58,862 --> 00:05:59,870
It's gin.
\- It's gin.

108
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:01,621
Have you remembered to ensure
there're sufficient

109
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,090
urine traces in the peanuts?

110
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:05,430
Yes,
I urinated on them myself.

111
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:09,450
Can I just ask: why have you got a drawing
of three stroke victims on the wall?

112
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,075
That's us.

113
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:14,409
- Er...
- What?

114
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:17,495
- Dartboard.
- Yes, it's a pub.

115
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:20,910
Darts is a fine game and helped
England win a lot of wars.

116
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,464
Darts is for people
who have no conversation.

117
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,990
- Rubbish!
- Who wants to go to the pub and do maths?

118
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:28,470
It's no good telling me what
you want your pub to be like.

119
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,731
- I don't want my pub...
- This is my pub. This is what it's like.

120
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:32,940
This is a traditional pub.

121
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,162
- This is what they look like.
- This is great. It works.

122
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,102
We're already talking
pub bollocks.

123
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,530
James, it's my job to
ridicule you, obviously.

124
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,470
But I can't. Because, apart from the
dartboard, you've done an incredible job.

125
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:46,064
- Thank you.
- But it isn't quite as incredible

126
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,495
as the job I've done.

127
00:06:49,972 --> 00:06:54,250
Whoa! I've gone, as you
can see, for a nautical theme.

128
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:56,519
- In the desert.
- Yes, bear with me.

129
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:58,300
Two-tone paintwork,
obviously.

130
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:02,097
Jet ski on the back,
and then, up on the top,

131
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:06,886
and this really is the pièce de
résistance, the flying bridge.

132
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,010
- What, so you can drive it from outside?
- Why would you not do that?

133
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,770
- Because you built it.
- I hate jet skis, by the way.

134
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:16,910
I know, but I... You told me my
hatred of darts is irrelevant.

135
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:19,170
- You kept mentioning it.
- It does look nautical.

136
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:21,330
- Shoes off. Shoes off.
- What?

137
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:23,030
- Shoes off.
- Why?

138
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:25,190
- It's a boat.
- Oh, I hate that!

139
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:27,190
I can afford
£2 million on a boat,

140
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:30,530
but not a new bit of carpet if it
gets some dust on it off my shoes.

141
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:32,570
- It's a bit Surrey.
- Off.

142
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:34,870
- Oh, God.
- Right, good.

143
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,290
Right, boots are off. Whoa!

144
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,840
- What?
- Is this all bathroom?

145
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:44,003
Yes, obviously.
Or lavatory.

146
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:46,284
Shower here, tiled,
as you can see.

147
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:47,808
Tasteful.

148
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:51,209
Sink unit, vanity mirror,
restrained.

149
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,253
And...
just pop this open like so.

150
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:57,870
- Wow.
- Lower the flap,

151
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:00,573
which means
that in the morning...

152
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:03,944
I can... sit down

153
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:06,111
and I can...
well, I can see the pub.

154
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:09,175
As we know, luxury is
defined by light and space.

155
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,721
- Hm?
- So this is a luxurious bog.

156
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,690
- Correct.
- And also, look.

157
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:17,791
This is not some camping lavatory where
you defecate on a piece of plastic.

158
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:19,292
Observe.

159
00:08:21,154 --> 00:08:23,069
Oh, it's a proper thing.

160
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:25,530
Well, how, where does...
where does that go?

161
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,737
- Underneath the RV.
- What, to, like, a tank or something?

162
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:31,143
No, underneath the RV.

163
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:33,607
What, you're going to
drive off in your bathroom

164
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:36,788
- leaving behind a mound of turds?
- Yes.

165
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,932
- Where are you gonna sleep?
- Here.

166
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,854
This is the exact same width
as my forearm.

167
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,182
Oh, yes.

168
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:46,683
It's more of
a cupboard, really, isn't it?

169
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,524
The roof, however,
was a different story.

170
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,785
- Whoa!
- Oh, I say.

171
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:54,786
Well, this is wasted space
normally, isn't it?

172
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:57,440
- Exactly.
- It's pretty good this, Hammond.

173
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:59,096
- But hang on a minute.
- What?

174
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:00,583
This is... This is very impressive.

175
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:03,262
- It's very...
- Aargh! Ha-ha, ha ha-ha!

176
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:06,012
Oh, yes!

177
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:07,777
- Ha, ha-ha!
- Oh, ho.

178
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:10,010
- So that's something to look forward to.
- Aargh!

179
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:12,990
Yeah, don't let
skin touch anything.

180
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:16,810
Right, so assuming you were able
to sit in the scaldingly hot seat.

181
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:18,830
- Yes.
- Under the blazing sun.

182
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:20,510
- Yes.
- How does it work?

183
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:22,690
Have you got brakes
and accelerator and...

184
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:24,910
Accelerating.

185
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:26,504
- Braking.
- Right.

186
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,765
- Gears.
- Oh, so it really is a boat.

187
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:31,926
Yeah. Look, the way I see it
is this, gentlemen.

188
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:35,950
Almost no one would want to go
on holiday in a 36-foot caravan,

189
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,965
but everybody
would bite your arm off

190
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:40,551
to go on holiday
in a 36-foot gin palace.

191
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:42,970
- They're not really that different.
- No, they're not.

192
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:45,810
It's just one floats on water
and one goes on land.

193
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:47,746
- Right, Hammond.
- Yes.

194
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:50,223
- Where's yours?
- Over there.

195
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,520
- What, behind the lorry?
- No, it is the lorry. That's it.

196
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,310
That's not an RV.

197
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,676
It is. Look, it's big, I can sleep on
it and it's got a bike on the back.

198
00:09:58,762 --> 00:10:00,144
That's a recreational
vehicle right there.

199
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,277
This we have got to see.

200
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:10,110
It's big and it needs to move along,
so a truck is the obvious answer.

201
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,430
- What sort of truck is it?
- I don't know. Truck.

202
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:15,010
These are the ones that used
to be the U-Haul lorry. Ooh!

203
00:10:15,095 --> 00:10:17,715
You've still got the sign
of the previous owner on it.

204
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:18,810
It doesn't matter.

205
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:20,830
Come aboard,
leave your shoes on,

206
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:22,690
cos this wood
is very splintery.

207
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:25,430
Um...

208
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:27,699
Here's the living
accommodation.

209
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:30,426
- What living accommodation?
- There's a bed.

210
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:33,957
There, bed. Telescope in case
I get bored in the evening.

211
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,090
And then rocking chair in case of
visitors and a motorcycle on the back.

212
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:40,168
So, just two secs.

213
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,169
- Stacks.
- Yeah.

214
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:43,870
- Engine?
- It's got a V8.

215
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:47,152
- Whose?
- Mine now, I bought the truck.

216
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:49,430
You have made
no effort whatsoever.

217
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,863
Oh, no, now I have,
but I've distilled it down.

218
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:56,043
I haven't wasted time and effort
on complicated stuff I don't need.

219
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:58,293
- This is honest.
- So when you come to my...

220
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,716
and say, "Please, Jeremy, can I
borrow your lavatory?" in the morning,

221
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:03,409
I'm gonna say no, cos you
accused me of wasting time.

222
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,990
And if you want to come to my
pub for a drink of your gin,

223
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,610
which I've put on tap
for you, I'll say,

224
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:09,036
"No, it's just
a waste of time, Hammond."

225
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:12,320
I didn't realise we were setting up
a sort of stock exchange of resources

226
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,816
- needed by the roaming camper.
- Hammond?

227
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:15,767
Yes?

228
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:18,363
Your lorry, I'm not
gonna call it an RV...

229
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:20,457
- It isn't an RV.
- Is dismal.

230
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:22,441
God strewth.

231
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:25,379
On that note, we set off...

232
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,289
to see what our RVs
and Hammond's lorry,

233
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,168
were like on the road.

234
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:40,129
So, let's have a look at what
we've got on the dash here.

235
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,668
Left-hand panel: don't know
what any of that does.

236
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:46,329
Central panel,
four warning lights.

237
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,770
Don't know what they're for.

238
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:49,191
They've got
handwritten notices

239
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:51,129
but that's all rubbed off.

240
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:55,441
Everything on the right-hand panel: CB
radio, stereo tape player etcetera -

241
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:57,910
all broken.
Switch here?

242
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:00,309
Nothing.

243
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:04,527
Air con is good, though, and that,
frankly, is all that matters.

244
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:06,793
It's 100 degrees out there.

245
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:14,652
Hello, viewers.
You join me driving my pub.

246
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:17,130
And given that the two things
I do most in life

247
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:19,530
are driving
and going to the pub,

248
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,496
this is a perfect
arrangement, isn't it?

249
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:24,560
Go on, change up,
you bastard.

250
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:27,322
Thank you.

251
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:33,582
Nice view, that.

252
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:35,941
Better than the view
from my pub back home.

253
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:39,480
That's a view of a wall
and some bins.

254
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:44,756
Hello, America.
I'm here to explore.

255
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,925
I'm not gonna push it
hard up this hill,

256
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:50,356
cos I've noticed
it's running quite hot.

257
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,121
Yeah, doing er...
15 miles an hour,

258
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,098
but... I'm really not
in a race.

259
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:01,592
Yeah, I'm down
to 13 miles an hour.

260
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:06,145
Which is plenty.

261
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,130
That's... That's my engine.

262
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:14,730
My engine is backfiring.

263
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:17,360
Yeah.

264
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,480
You don't wanna
break down round here.

265
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:24,152
This is where
all the madmen live...

266
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:29,360
that follow you in pick-up
trucks and black lorries.

267
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:32,230
What is...?

268
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,619
What's that?

269
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:40,218
What the hell?

270
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,730
Did you see that guy?

271
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:56,012
I didn't see anybody. Where?

272
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:57,746
What guy?

273
00:13:57,832 --> 00:14:01,067
The guy at the side of
the road. Did you see him?

274
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:02,724
No, I didn't see anybody.

275
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,850
No,
there was nobody in the road.

276
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:06,496
Jeremy.

277
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:08,410
Why aren't you driving
yours on the roof?

278
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:10,150
Well, it's annoying.

279
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:12,450
It turns out off-road
I can drive it on the roof,

280
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,090
but when I'm on the road,

281
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:16,750
there's a law
that says I can't.

282
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,210
What, that you can't drive
your RV from the roof?

283
00:14:19,295 --> 00:14:22,690
- Yeah, I know.
- It's health and safety gone mad.

284
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,270
It's ridiculous.

285
00:14:24,355 --> 00:14:28,250
My only real issue, and
it is - it's significant -

286
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:32,630
is that my idle speed
is 5,000rpm,

287
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:35,730
which means my foot is
now not on the accelerator

288
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:38,590
and I'm now doing 48.

289
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:40,920
Oh, Christ...
Hang on, wait, stand by.

290
00:14:45,547 --> 00:14:48,277
You have to jab
the throttle like that,

291
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:50,378
to get it to stop
accelerating,

292
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:53,339
which, of course, causes
you to accelerate more.

293
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:54,770
So if there's an emergency,

294
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:57,730
I must
accelerate like that...

295
00:14:57,816 --> 00:15:01,496
to then be able
to slow down.

296
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:05,790
Look at that.

297
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,150
If he had a purple jacket on

298
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:08,816
he'd look like
one of those men

299
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,790
who takes old ladies
on tours of North Wales.

300
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,360
I'm going to pull in in
front of you, so tell me when I can.

301
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:19,137
Not yet. Not yet.

302
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,613
Not yet. Not yet.

303
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:27,270
Not yet. Not yet.

304
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:29,331
Now.

305
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,089
Can you speed up a bit, Hammond?
We're all bunching up.

306
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:33,630
Urrrrh!

307
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:36,090
I can't go
much faster than this.

308
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:40,270
It starts to overheat
quite badly and suddenly.

309
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:44,105
I'm not sure
I'd trust us three doing...

310
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:45,840
doing this.

311
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,855
Soon we arrived in
a typical American town.

312
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:58,410
Which, of course,
had a typical RV campsite.

313
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:03,277
This'll do. We're home.

314
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,395
So, we decided
to check in for the night.

315
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,194
Ow.

316
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:14,400
33 I'm looking for.

317
00:16:15,835 --> 00:16:17,115
That's me.

318
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,858
Stop, stop.

319
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:29,999
Stop. Stop.

320
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:36,840
Idle speed has gone
completely berserk.

321
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,110
I do apologise, everybody.

322
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:40,970
There's literally
nothing I can do.

323
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:44,230
That is my idle speed.

324
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:47,642
Aargh! Ha-ha, ha-ha!

325
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:53,265
My ignition key is at
3,000 degrees centigrade.

326
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:57,150
Sorry, everyone.
Sorry about the noise.

327
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:58,950
I know,
we'll use the director.

328
00:16:59,044 --> 00:17:00,292
Sorry, mate,
if you could just

329
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:02,465
turn the engine off
that would be great.

330
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:08,889
Call 911. He's going to need
some fingers in a minute.

331
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:11,590
Ow!

332
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:19,070
Yeah, it does that.

333
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:20,970
How hot
are those ignition keys?

334
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:23,670
Hot!

335
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:25,950
Not as hot as
the cameraman's right leg.

336
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:27,588
Yeah, that nearly took my...

337
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:31,000
That was flame
enveloped your right leg.

338
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,041
Oh, sh... Oh, guys.

339
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:35,432
We have an emergency.

340
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:39,925
Yeah.

341
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,229
On the other, more
peaceful side of the park,

342
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,540
I'd settled down
to soak up life in my row.

343
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,120
Hello, neighbour.

344
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:02,280
I'll come over later, maybe
play cards or something.

345
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,394
That dog's taking a wee.

346
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:15,890
Meanwhile, at the Rack and
Pinion, it was opening time.

347
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:40,200
Drop by for a beer later
if you like.

348
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:48,690
As James got
acquainted with his neighbours,

349
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:52,950
Hammond was showing me
the view from his veranda.

350
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:55,565
There is a compound there where
you take your dog for a crap.

351
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:58,041
Is that... is
that a dog lavatory? Yes.

352
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:01,302
My... My porch overlooks it.

353
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:04,002
Can I tell you
what a member of our crew,

354
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:06,110
who I won't name because it'd
be embarrassing, but it was...

355
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:08,890
- What does it begin with?
- It was Ellis the photographer it begins with.

356
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:11,674
He said to me, is when people
come round these places,

357
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,715
- what you do is...
- Yeah?

358
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:16,590
It's not for camera.

359
00:19:16,675 --> 00:19:20,721
You put the word "anal" in front of
all of the names of the caravans.

360
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,052
- So you've
got Anal Wanderer...

361
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:26,260
Anal Gearbox...

362
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:29,377
- Anal Desire.
- Anal Hemisphere.

363
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,754
Anal Open Range.
Anal Cougar.

364
00:19:33,097 --> 00:19:35,604
Anal Sprinter.

365
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:38,370
That's what you do!

366
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:43,893
Over at the pub, James was
dispensing drinks to the locals.

367
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,515
It's a bit lively, sir. I'm sorry,
but the pub has been on the move

368
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:49,430
- and rattled around quite a bit.
- Oh, I bet.

369
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:52,370
If you leave that just to
settle for a few minutes.

370
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:54,523
I'll try a warm brown,
please.

371
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:59,430
- More foamy?
- A little bit foamy.

372
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:02,090
If you'd like to just let
that settle for a bit, sir.

373
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:05,531
I think I'll go with
a Jack Daniels.

374
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,369
Having run out of bottom jokes,
Hammond and I had gone for a walk

375
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:15,000
in what's billed as the
great American wilderness.

376
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:24,440
- Is that a scrapyard?
- Yes.

377
00:20:28,315 --> 00:20:30,976
I do prefer
the Lake District.

378
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:35,009
Back at the pub, James
was entertaining his guests

379
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,218
with his conversation.

380
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:40,850
What you call warm British beer
to us is cellar temperature,

381
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:45,367
which is not as cold as a refrigerator
but colder than room temperature.

382
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:47,963
Right, right, right.

383
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:51,999
Erm... anybody mind
if I have one?

384
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,703
- No. Help yourself.
- No. Help yourself.

385
00:20:58,315 --> 00:21:00,870
I mean, there must
be more to it than this.

386
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:02,830
You do wonder
what people do.

387
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:05,078
I don't wonder.
I know what they do.

388
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:07,160
They wife-swap.

389
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:10,476
- Sunset?
- It's lovely.

390
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:17,970
- Hammond.
- What?

391
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:20,078
- Hammond. Do you...?
- What?

392
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:22,409
- Did you see that?
- See what?

393
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:29,882
- What?
- No, nothing.

394
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:32,517
- I'm going to turn in.
- Yeah, you're right. Sleep.

395
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:35,382
Well, this year, because
we've had a record summer,

396
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:36,828
it's actually
very warm and sunny

397
00:21:36,914 --> 00:21:38,593
but usually...
September's all right

398
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:42,085
but by the time you get to November,
certainly, it's getting cold.

399
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:44,543
The worst bit in England
is sort of January...

400
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:49,810
After James had run
out of his conversation,

401
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,730
he shut his pub for the night

402
00:21:51,815 --> 00:21:55,912
and came round to my place
with a plan.

403
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:58,357
Clarkson.

404
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,230
Clarkson.

405
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:03,290
- What?
- I've got an idea.

406
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,750
- What?
- To go and burgle Hammond's tent.

407
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:10,320
You know how he's been burgled
before and he just doesn't notice?

408
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:16,470
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Exactly.

409
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:20,250
Hammond claimed after he
was burgled on holiday last year,

410
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:24,850
he hadn't woken up because
the burglars had gassed him.

411
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:26,830
Yeah, right.

412
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:30,400
- Where's his lorry tent?
- The far side.

413
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:55,720
Where's all my stuff?

414
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:59,920
The bastards!

415
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:14,440
- Good morning.
- Hm. Dubious.

416
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,193
Ow.

417
00:23:19,747 --> 00:23:21,752
Clarkson!

418
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:25,468
- What?
- Have you stolen my bag?

419
00:23:25,702 --> 00:23:27,937
- What?
- Have you stolen my bag?

420
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:29,444
- No.
- Yes, you have.

421
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,950
I haven't.

422
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,305
Took everything.

423
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,230
That's all I have.

424
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:37,850
- You've been burgled?
- Yes.

425
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:39,990
They must have gassed you.

426
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:41,610
That's all I can think of,
Hammond.

427
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:44,849
I know that you're saying
that to be funny. Ha-ha!

428
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:46,570
Well, that's what you said
when you got burgled in France.

429
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:49,390
- Because it probably was.
- But you probably were again last night.

430
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,670
- How are you feeling?
- You haven't got it? Seriously?

431
00:23:51,756 --> 00:23:53,461
I haven't got your bag.

432
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,424
James.

433
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,145
- James...
- Hang on.

434
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,806
- Have you stolen my bag?
- You what?

435
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:05,185
- Have you stolen my bag?
- No.

436
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:14,130
He's just this
lonely little figure.

437
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:19,451
Shall we let him have breakfast before
we admit that we've got his bag?

438
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:20,834
Well...

439
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,545
I don't really want to
sit eating breakfast

440
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,521
with him naked, that's the thing.

441
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:28,896
Hammond, I think
we've solved your crime.

442
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:30,873
We've solved it.

443
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:34,134
We have found the gas
canisters, look, here.

444
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,360
It's a lot of gas.

445
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,069
If you've had
this much gas...

446
00:24:39,155 --> 00:24:41,010
It looks like
a litre and a half of gas.

447
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,070
It's interesting they've
spelt gas wrong, look.

448
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:46,170
Well, they got
the first letter right.

449
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:47,545
Look, here.

450
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:49,046
You're saying
I gassed myself?

451
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,550
They weren't both full
when I started.

452
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:54,090
- That's
because you'd already started them.

453
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:03,250
Having given
Hammond his clothes back,

454
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,510
we met for breakfast
at the pub.

455
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:10,130
I was kept awake for some time last
night by the man in the neighbouring RV

456
00:25:10,215 --> 00:25:12,510
- scratching his eczema.
- Ooh.

457
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,370
Or might have been
sanding a table.

458
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:16,970
No, I had a couple
in the one next to me.

459
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:20,750
- And when I say next to me, I mean here.
- Yes.

460
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:23,010
- Why do they do that?
- I don't know.

461
00:25:23,095 --> 00:25:24,830
Nevada's massive.

462
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:27,258
Why would you park your...
"Right, we're going to Nevada"

463
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:29,970
because it's massive and empty
and I'm going to park there,

464
00:25:30,055 --> 00:25:34,240
so that they can hear the precise
moment when my wife and I...

465
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:37,670
"do grown-up things."

466
00:25:37,755 --> 00:25:42,970
We then discussed what holiday
activity we'd do to fill the day.

467
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:45,550
- Balloon rides.
- I hate balloons!

468
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:47,870
- The world's largest gift shop.
- No.

469
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:50,070
How do they know it's
the world's largest?

470
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:52,563
Is it a shop containing
the world's largest gift?

471
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:53,639
No.

472
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:54,870
Yes.

473
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:58,561
Is there anything a bit more
cultural, like Indian art?

474
00:25:58,678 --> 00:26:00,130
Or Native American,
as we should say.

475
00:26:00,215 --> 00:26:01,803
You just said Indian,
you racist.

476
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:02,960
That's not actually racist.

477
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:05,449
James, we're not going to
look at Native American art.

478
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:06,959
- Why not?
- It's rubbish.

479
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,430
How do you know it's rubbish?

480
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:10,410
- Because I've seen it. It's rubbish.
- You haven't seen all of it.

481
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:13,790
Well, I've seen some. I've seen
enough of it to know it's dreary.

482
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:16,430
- Sunrise meditation.
- Oh, that'll be good.

483
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:18,470
It isn't good. What would
be good about that?

484
00:26:18,555 --> 00:26:21,090
I don't know because I haven't seen
it but I'm prepared to have a look.

485
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:24,130
Why don't we...
You know those big Baja

486
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,630
off-road 28-inch suspension
travel things?

487
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:29,650
- Dune racer type things.
- Dune racers.

488
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:32,970
Why don't we get three of those
and belt around in the desert?

489
00:26:33,055 --> 00:26:35,070
- Yes.
- Cos that would be bovine.

490
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:36,330
I wouldn't learn anything
from that.

491
00:26:36,415 --> 00:26:38,070
I'd rather go and do
something cultural.

492
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:39,730
Blasting around a dune
sounds like fun.

493
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,510
Come on. I tell you what,

494
00:26:41,595 --> 00:26:44,186
you want to go and
do Native American art.

495
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:45,050
Mm-hm.

496
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:47,930
- We want to go dune racing. Yes?
- Right.

497
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,290
Let's have a vote.

498
00:26:52,435 --> 00:26:54,680
I would be driving this.

499
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:58,720
A Jakes Fabworks JF5U.

500
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:03,170
James would be driving this.

501
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:06,040
An Alumi Craft Class 10.

502
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:10,000
And Hammond would have this.

503
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:13,240
A plastic green
pick-up truck.

504
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:21,550
OK. Now,
this is supposed to be...

505
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:23,637
Ow! ..a Volkswagen Beetle.

506
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:26,028
Because that is
where this sport began -

507
00:27:26,114 --> 00:27:29,153
people racing Bugs
round the desert.

508
00:27:30,393 --> 00:27:34,942
But it's got a 2.4 litre
Chevrolet engine...

509
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:39,548
and a sequential gearbox.

510
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:43,598
The only thing it really has in
common with a Beetle is nothing.

511
00:27:46,113 --> 00:27:48,033
Jumping!

512
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:50,822
Ha-ha!

513
00:27:50,993 --> 00:27:55,512
Over we go, 16 inches of
suspension travel at the front.

514
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:03,872
18 at the back means landing
is really very comfortable.

515
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:13,091
Oh, yes!

516
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:20,588
My 2013 Currie underneath
this plastic pick-up body

517
00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:23,988
has the same tubular space
range chassis as the other two.

518
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:25,648
But I've only got
a two-litre engine.

519
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:30,268
However, it's a Ford Eco
Boost, so it's turbo-charged.

520
00:28:30,353 --> 00:28:33,528
And they've tuned it so
it's putting out just shy...

521
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:34,988
Landing!

522
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:38,307
Of 300 brake horsepower.

523
00:28:39,793 --> 00:28:42,463
And now I'm gonna fly again.

524
00:28:42,694 --> 00:28:45,419
Aagh! Ha-ha-ha!

525
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:48,264
This is bliss.

526
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:52,908
Meanwhile, in the
Alumi Craft Class 10...

527
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:55,828
I've got dust in my face.

528
00:28:55,913 --> 00:28:57,248
It doesn't have a windscreen.

529
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:00,508
I don't like cars with no
windscreen.

530
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:02,488
Why do I let the others
talk me into this?

531
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,112
Why don't I just tell them
to bugger off?

532
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:10,547
Ahhh-ha-ha!

533
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:13,805
Last time I did that
it ended very badly!

534
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:18,368
The races they do in these
things are enormous.

535
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:21,168
Hundreds, sometimes
1,000 miles or more.

536
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:25,773
Sometimes they'll spend nine
hours a day in the driving seat.

537
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:29,477
Oh! I so want one of these.

538
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:33,734
Come on, let's have
some air here!

539
00:29:34,645 --> 00:29:36,740
Yeah! Ha-ha-ha!

540
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:38,937
What a riot!

541
00:29:40,326 --> 00:29:44,031
How can James May
not enjoy this?

542
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:48,094
As it happened,
he was starting to enjoy it.

543
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:51,406
And weeeee!

544
00:29:54,145 --> 00:29:56,800
Getting sideways a bit.

545
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:58,242
Whoa.

546
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,422
Watch me fly! Here I go.

547
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:08,922
Ha-ha!
I'm gonna do one more.

548
00:30:10,553 --> 00:30:12,848
After Billy Bob May
had had his fun...

549
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:15,203
Weeeee!

550
00:30:15,353 --> 00:30:18,601
- We all stopped for a breather.
- Yes.

551
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:21,626
I don't like admitting you're right, but
I can be magnanimous. It's brilliant.

552
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:23,848
You've wasted your life
with Chopin and plywood.

553
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,588
You're a dune racer.

554
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:28,428
You've always been a dune racer,
you just didn't know you were.

555
00:30:28,513 --> 00:30:30,416
It was just fantastic,
and it's comfortable.

556
00:30:30,502 --> 00:30:33,190
That's the thing. It's comfortable
motorsport because of the suspension.

557
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:34,328
It's just... It's brilliant.

558
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:36,556
- It's cheapskate motorsport.
- Is it?

559
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:39,837
It's cheapskate motorsport for people
with dicky backs, that's what it is.

560
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,508
Because landing is so soft.

561
00:30:41,593 --> 00:30:43,303
Oh, sometimes I'm
thinking, have I landed?

562
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:44,280
Yes.

563
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:47,103
I've got a brilliant idea.
What are you looking at?

564
00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:50,868
What?

565
00:30:50,953 --> 00:30:53,198
There's something glinting
up there.

566
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:57,645
- There isn't.
- Yeah, whatever.

567
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:58,946
It's just...

568
00:30:59,032 --> 00:31:00,348
Anyway, what's
your brilliant idea?

569
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:01,728
- Anyway, I've got a brilliant idea.
- What?

570
00:31:01,813 --> 00:31:03,377
Time trial, flying lap,

571
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:04,808
one at a time
against the clock.

572
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:07,111
I'll go first.

573
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,528
You really...
You must put that right.

574
00:31:09,613 --> 00:31:11,288
Where's me car?

575
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:14,928
- He really has taken to it, hasn't he?
- He really has.

576
00:31:15,013 --> 00:31:19,878
Having jumped back in, Billy
Bob embarked on his flying lap.

577
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:22,528
Here he comes.

578
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:24,513
Go!

579
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:29,038
Here we go.

580
00:31:30,353 --> 00:31:31,988
Wayyyy!

581
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:34,588
That's James May!

582
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:36,918
It's just not right, is it?

583
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:40,448
What's next? He's gonna
take up cage fighting?

584
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:45,638
I'm flying!

585
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:49,438
Oh, my God!

586
00:31:51,153 --> 00:31:53,478
Look at this. He's actually
kicking the arse out.

587
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:00,822
- 57 seconds.
- Well, we don't know

588
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:03,348
whether that's fast or not
but it is less than a minute.

589
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:06,181
Is that the first time he's done
anything in less than a minute?

590
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:07,419
He can't open a car door

591
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,178
- in less than a minute.
- No. Or sign his name.

592
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:11,900
No, that's two minutes,
definitely.

593
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:13,997
Biggles is back.

594
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,822
I can do a slightly
better one than that.

595
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:18,648
- Can I have another go?
- Oh, for God's sake!

596
00:32:18,733 --> 00:32:21,108
Next it was my turn.

597
00:32:21,193 --> 00:32:23,008
I just wanna say, Hammond.

598
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:26,788
- What?
- You have twice as much horsepower as me,

599
00:32:26,873 --> 00:32:29,908
and, May, you have 50
horsepower more than I've got.

600
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:33,988
So it's only my immense skill that's
going to put me in contention here.

601
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:35,788
- Is it?
- Well, what else is there?

602
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:38,528
He won't have any excuses
ready for the end at this rate.

603
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:43,357
Yours weighs less. It's 200
kilograms lighter than this.

604
00:32:43,474 --> 00:32:45,099
- Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.
- Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.

605
00:32:45,185 --> 00:32:48,442
I'm just saying, in
case I'm not as quick.

606
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:52,809
Eventually, Mr
Racing Excuses was underway.

607
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:55,288
Here he comes,
into his flying lap.

608
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:02,558
Right, here we go.

609
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:11,518
- Did I make that much noise?
- Yes.

610
00:33:15,153 --> 00:33:17,398
Concentrating very hard.

611
00:33:21,993 --> 00:33:23,638
He's not very good
through there.

612
00:33:26,513 --> 00:33:28,758
Getting a bit squirrely now.

613
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:33,558
No, he's rubbish
through there.

614
00:33:34,353 --> 00:33:36,597
No! I was airborne there

615
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,832
long enough for them
to serve me their snacks.

616
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:44,998
Get it straight.

617
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:58,063
And there we are.

618
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:02,340
I don't know how I've done,
but it felt pretty good to me.

619
00:34:06,273 --> 00:34:08,733
There are few things
in life I enjoy more

620
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:11,368
than delivering bad
news to Jeremy Clarkson.

621
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,817
It's possibly
my favourite thing.

622
00:34:15,193 --> 00:34:18,020
Forcing myself
not to do a little dance.

623
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:20,590
How much faster was I?

624
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:23,848
Well, unless your seconds
were smaller,

625
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:27,168
you were slower,
because you were 58.5.

626
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:30,387
- What was he?
- 57.81.

627
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:34,622
What that means is
he beat you.

628
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:38,558
I cannot believe that.

629
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:42,598
Has anybody got a gun?

630
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:48,148
Finally, it was
the turn of Ricky Redneck.

631
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:50,903
- Right, ready with the stop watch.
- Here we go.

632
00:34:56,153 --> 00:34:58,707
This is how you do this.

633
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:04,788
Oh, yeah.

634
00:35:04,873 --> 00:35:08,212
He's in a pick-up
truck, on a loose surface.

635
00:35:08,298 --> 00:35:09,857
Yeah, he's at home.

636
00:35:12,942 --> 00:35:14,957
You know at the moment
you're winning?

637
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:17,817
- Yeah.
- In a minute, you won't be.

638
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:23,158
- What are you looking at?
- That glint.

639
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,700
- You see it?
- No.

640
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:30,358
Thrashing air!

641
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,762
Ah-ha-ha!

642
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:36,268
Into the left-hander.

643
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:37,648
Keep it tight.

644
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,208
Oh, what was that?

645
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:41,518
What the hell was that?

646
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,238
- That was...
- What's the matter with him?

647
00:35:47,273 --> 00:35:49,828
Has he bust the gear box?

648
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:51,628
What...
Not very quick.

649
00:35:51,713 --> 00:35:53,188
What was the matter?

650
00:35:53,273 --> 00:35:55,008
That was the weirdest thing.

651
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:57,520
- What?
- It's like a ricochet.

652
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:03,184
As I wasn't interested
in Hammond's excuses...

653
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:06,309
we got back into our RVs
and hit the road.

654
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:12,637
Ping, it was like a rico...
like it came off something.

655
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:15,887
I suppose it could have
been a stone.

656
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:20,377
Hold on a minute.

657
00:36:20,485 --> 00:36:22,500
May, are you behind me?

658
00:36:22,586 --> 00:36:26,168
Is my RV drooping slightly?

659
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:28,328
Well, funnily enough
I was just looking at that.

660
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:30,942
I would say
it's very down on the left.

661
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:36,943
That's broken, isn't it?

662
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,688
Yeah, it's leaning a lot.

663
00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:41,395
Mate, it really is leaning.
That's collapsed.

664
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,340
That's how it's
supposed to be.

665
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:45,185
Yeah, some distance between
the body and the ground.

666
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:49,301
Yeah, you can see more wheel on
this side than the other side.

667
00:36:52,718 --> 00:36:57,293
However, as I wasn't interested
in Clarkson's mechanical issues either,

668
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:59,747
we got back
on the road again.

669
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:02,208
Right, so here's
the situation.

670
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:06,793
I'm driving my RV with an
overheating, over-revving engine,

671
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:10,161
and collapsed suspension,
on an interstate.

672
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:13,163
Feels safe, that.

673
00:37:17,663 --> 00:37:20,978
Soon it was time
to find a campsite,

674
00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:25,788
and since we didn't fancy another
night in a horrible RV park,

675
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:28,488
and we had
all the comforts we needed,

676
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:32,118
we decided to freestyle it
in the wilderness.

677
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:35,688
I think it's
an excellent idea.

678
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:39,499
I mean, dune buggy racing is
fantastic, and I won,

679
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:41,905
but it is quite hot
and sweaty and dusty

680
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:47,007
and we can balance that with
peace and quiet and a starry sky.

681
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:49,546
I mean, that's gonna be
fantastic out here.

682
00:37:50,553 --> 00:37:53,210
I might write a few lines
of verse.

683
00:37:55,433 --> 00:38:00,238
So, we turned off the interstate
to find a nice spot to park up.

684
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,960
Oh, yeah, now we are getting
into the great outdoors.

685
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:11,728
James, how's my jet ski?

686
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:15,348
Yep, you're fine.

687
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:20,118
Eventually we found the
perfect spot at the side of a lake.

688
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:23,248
- However...
- I can't stop.

689
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,367
I've lost braking!
I've lost braking!

690
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:27,843
I have no control!

691
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:34,688
Using nothing
but blind panic...

692
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:37,088
Stop, stop!

693
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:39,460
Stop!

694
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:43,726
I eventually brought
my stupid RV to heel.

695
00:38:45,553 --> 00:38:48,265
Oh, for Christ's sake.

696
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,668
Right.

697
00:38:51,753 --> 00:38:55,838
With no help from the crew,
I removed the jet ski...

698
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,096
Excellent.

699
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,055
And then tried to move
the RV onto level ground.

700
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:07,348
Come on. Fire, baby.

701
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:09,518
Come on, you know
you wanna be an engine.

702
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:18,108
Hah!
His jet ski's fallen off.

703
00:39:18,193 --> 00:39:21,742
OK, bit of jiggery pokery,
we'll get round there. Ohhh.

704
00:39:24,313 --> 00:39:26,671
Jeremy. Stop!

705
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:33,248
Has...

706
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:34,433
Jesus!

707
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,508
Give me strength.

708
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:41,948
Oh, what's happened to my...
I'm really sorry.

709
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:43,728
Oh, shit,
have I hit your axle?

710
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:45,968
- I mean your prop shaft?
- Er... yeah.

711
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:48,168
- And I...
- And that's a wrap.

712
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,628
With that, back to the tent.

713
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:53,208
They are actually tied
in a knot.

714
00:39:57,553 --> 00:39:59,848
Once the ape
had untangled himself,

715
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:01,868
and we were all parked,

716
00:40:01,953 --> 00:40:07,133
I settled down to write some
poetry in the evening stillness.

717
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:45,008
Hello, mate. Ooh-hoo!

718
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:47,157
Bartender, can I have a beer?

719
00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:49,071
I can't hear you over
that appalling racket.

720
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,181
What?

721
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:53,055
I can't hear you over
that appalling racket.

722
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:54,478
- Can I have a beer?
- I can't hear you

723
00:40:54,563 --> 00:40:55,751
over that racket.
No, you can't.

724
00:40:55,836 --> 00:40:57,109
- Oh, come on.
- It's run out.

725
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:58,728
It's hasn't run out.
It's a pub!

726
00:40:58,813 --> 00:41:00,248
It's run out of beer for you.

727
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,308
I'm a tired and thirsty
traveller from out in the desert.

728
00:41:03,393 --> 00:41:05,828
If you put the appalling
two-stroke motorcycle away,

729
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:07,728
and come in the pub,
you can have a beer.

730
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:10,448
- Otherwise you can go...
- Oh, look at that! -Oh no.

731
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:12,838
Power! Come on!

732
00:41:13,913 --> 00:41:15,548
May!

733
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:17,393
Yee-ha!

734
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:24,628
Oh, ha! May!

735
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:26,888
Hey, hey! Well,
I'm not not missing out.

736
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:41,348
Jet ski, jet ski,
sounding shite,

737
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:44,048
on Lake Vegas,
left and right.

738
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:47,128
Rotax engine, rin bin bin.

739
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:51,028
I hope the owner's arse
caves in.

740
00:41:53,933 --> 00:41:56,028
Oh, ha-ha!

741
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:59,068
As darkness fell,
we put the toys away

742
00:41:59,153 --> 00:42:01,848
and James turned in
for a good night's sleep.

743
00:42:09,513 --> 00:42:11,668
Sadly for him, though,

744
00:42:11,753 --> 00:42:15,547
Hammond and I had decided
to do a bit of stargazing.

745
00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:29,088
Hammond, what are you doing?

746
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:30,848
Setting my lights up.

747
00:42:30,933 --> 00:42:32,668
What for?

748
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:35,108
Well, you've seen
Close Encounters.

749
00:42:35,194 --> 00:42:35,981
Yes.

750
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:38,295
Well, I've got the
full setup here, mate.

751
00:42:39,273 --> 00:42:41,248
This desert that we're in

752
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:43,948
lies between Area 51
and Roswell.

753
00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:48,768
One of the primary and main alien
hotspots on this whole planet, mate.

754
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,148
Oh, shut up.

755
00:42:54,233 --> 00:42:55,768
What's that for?

756
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:58,628
To power the lights.
And the keyboard.

757
00:42:58,713 --> 00:43:00,914
- What? A keyboard?
- You've seen the film.

758
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,488
I am not gonna miss an
opportunity to do this here.

759
00:43:03,573 --> 00:43:05,948
Do you actually
believe in this stuff?

760
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:09,088
Yes, there's enough evidence,
enough people who've seen them.

761
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:11,448
The American Government,
came out and said.

762
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:14,148
Area 51 was real.
It's a thing.

763
00:43:14,233 --> 00:43:17,867
It's a thing cos it's... It's
an aviation testing place.

764
00:43:17,953 --> 00:43:19,468
It's Edwards Air Force base.

765
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:22,484
Yeah, they say that. They'll never
tell you exactly what it is. 62%.

766
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:25,406
Roswell was
a nuclear experiment,

767
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:26,883
I think, called Mogul.

768
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:30,648
62% of Americans believe in
intelligent alien life. 62%.

769
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:33,055
80% of Americans
don't have passports.

770
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:34,308
- Hammond.
- What?

771
00:43:34,393 --> 00:43:37,695
You're an alien, you've come a
very great distance to earth.

772
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:40,062
- Yes.
- Why do they always land

773
00:43:40,148 --> 00:43:41,672
in Southwest America?

774
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:43,109
It's big and open and quiet.

775
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:45,308
Why do they want to land
on a planet where it's quiet?

776
00:43:45,393 --> 00:43:46,891
To have a mooch about in
secret,

777
00:43:46,977 --> 00:43:48,930
- not be interfered with.
- Why don't they talk to us?

778
00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:50,586
Why don't they land in London?

779
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:51,782
They might wanna talk to us.

780
00:43:51,867 --> 00:43:53,570
They could land in Hyde Park.

781
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,528
Listen, I can talk to them.

782
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:02,748
Oh, sorry. Wait a minute.

783
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:07,668
Oh, no.

784
00:44:09,993 --> 00:44:13,208
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, for God's sake, get it right.

785
00:44:13,293 --> 00:44:15,728
Oh. No, wait.

786
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:20,828
No.

787
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:25,508
No.

788
00:44:25,593 --> 00:44:26,808
- Hammond.
- What?

789
00:44:26,893 --> 00:44:29,718
- You see that guy?
- Where?

790
00:44:31,313 --> 00:44:32,508
He's gone.

791
00:44:32,593 --> 00:44:34,928
It's pitch...
There's nobody out there.

792
00:44:35,013 --> 00:44:36,428
It's just a desert.

793
00:44:36,513 --> 00:44:38,168
That's why the aliens
come here.

794
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:42,548
Weird.

795
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:47,748
No.

796
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,028
For God's sake, shut up!

797
00:44:50,113 --> 00:44:52,278
No.

798
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:03,678
The next morning, the
vista from my RV was terrible.

799
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:08,988
- Are you?
- Am I what?

800
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,128
Having a dump?

801
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:13,188
- Yes.
- Oh, for...

802
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:16,848
The whole point of sitting here
is to enjoy this magnificent view.

803
00:45:16,933 --> 00:45:19,728
I was here first.
You're spoiling my view.

804
00:45:19,813 --> 00:45:22,008
- I'm spoiling your view?
- Yes.

805
00:45:22,093 --> 00:45:24,948
I'm not crapping in it.

806
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:27,888
We then headed over
to the pub for breakfast.

807
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:29,033
However...

808
00:45:35,073 --> 00:45:36,688
Why haven't you
made us breakfast?

809
00:45:36,773 --> 00:45:40,288
Because breakfast is reserved
exclusively for my friends,

810
00:45:40,373 --> 00:45:42,398
and none of them are here.

811
00:45:44,713 --> 00:45:46,968
Have you seriously
not made us anything?

812
00:45:47,053 --> 00:45:49,848
Yes, seriously,
I have not made you anything.

813
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:51,388
I'm hungry.

814
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:52,848
Well let's not
get bogged down

815
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:55,188
with his
unbelievable selfishness.

816
00:45:55,273 --> 00:45:56,628
It really is, though.

817
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:59,368
Let's work out
what we're going to do today.

818
00:45:59,453 --> 00:46:00,988
Dune buggy racing.

819
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:04,248
You've already done that.
We've all done that.

820
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:07,388
I thought we could
go to a race track.

821
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,468
- No, not a race track.
- Why not a race track?

822
00:46:09,553 --> 00:46:11,768
- I don't like race tracks.
- You like dune buggies.

823
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:14,408
That's dune buggies. Normal
race tracks are just boring.

824
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:17,128
- Oh, come on, it'll be great fun.
- OK, we'll settle it.

825
00:46:17,213 --> 00:46:18,918
Let's have a vote.

826
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:23,168
This was the track we chose.

827
00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:26,158
The Spring Mountain
race complex.

828
00:46:27,073 --> 00:46:29,358
And the cars?

829
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:33,608
Well, I went for the latest,

830
00:46:33,693 --> 00:46:36,558
and last ever,
front-engined Corvette.

831
00:46:38,993 --> 00:46:43,278
Hammond went for the Jeep
Grand Cherokee Terrahawk.

832
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:49,048
And May, still craving
a bit of peace and quiet,

833
00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:52,198
went for the Cadillac CTS-V.

834
00:46:54,113 --> 00:46:56,108
And this was all tremendous.

835
00:46:56,193 --> 00:46:58,208
But before we
got down to business,

836
00:46:58,293 --> 00:47:00,508
I made a terrible mistake,

837
00:47:00,593 --> 00:47:04,278
and asked my colleagues
a technical question.

838
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,348
All three of these cars have
6.2 litre supercharged V8s.

839
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:11,008
- Yes? Yes.
- Yes, they do, yes.

840
00:47:11,093 --> 00:47:12,688
What I want to know is,
right,

841
00:47:12,773 --> 00:47:15,028
- they're all pushrod engines.
- Mm-hm.

842
00:47:15,113 --> 00:47:17,448
Now, whenever I'm presented
with a pushrod engine,

843
00:47:17,533 --> 00:47:20,918
I know I have to go,
"..pushrod?"

844
00:47:21,793 --> 00:47:23,568
But I don't know why.

845
00:47:23,653 --> 00:47:26,148
What is a pushrod engine?

846
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:28,908
It's an engine where pushrods
activate the valve train.

847
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:30,548
The valves on top
of the cylinders

848
00:47:30,633 --> 00:47:32,808
have to open and close
to let the mixture get out.

849
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:36,248
Rather than having camshafts over
the top doing that, opening them,

850
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,408
they have a single camshaft
at the bottom

851
00:47:38,493 --> 00:47:41,068
that operates rods
that push the valves.

852
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:43,868
American cars have pushrod
engines and can't rev quickly.

853
00:47:43,953 --> 00:47:46,848
They have bigger capacities with long
stroke, which makes the engine bigger.

854
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:50,748
The problem is, for an equal
capacity engine, with overhead cams,

855
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:53,968
the engine would be bigger but you
wouldn't need the extra capacity

856
00:47:54,053 --> 00:47:57,268
because it would rev higher and
deliver more power at a higher RPM.

857
00:47:57,353 --> 00:48:00,268
But, on the other hand, if you had
a high-revving sports car engine,

858
00:48:00,353 --> 00:48:03,288
such as an Italian one, you would have
a very over square piston dimension,

859
00:48:03,373 --> 00:48:05,188
which would make
the engine squatter,

860
00:48:05,273 --> 00:48:07,879
and a dry sump, which would
allow you to mount it lower...

861
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,648
After a couple of hours,

862
00:48:10,733 --> 00:48:13,668
I invited Hammond
to stop talking

863
00:48:13,753 --> 00:48:18,688
and try out what is America's
answer to the Lamborghini Urus...

864
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:20,348
the Terrahawk.

865
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:28,228
Pulling this 700-horsepower,
6.2-litre supercharged V8

866
00:48:28,556 --> 00:48:30,611
out of a Dodge
Challenger Hellcat

867
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:32,592
into a Jeep off-roader,

868
00:48:32,872 --> 00:48:34,493
might sound like
it makes as much sense

869
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,867
as fitting me
with Usain Bolt's legs.

870
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,085
I mean, the power's there but nothing
else about the machine can handle it.

871
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:44,282
But it's more than
just a cartoon.

872
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:46,643
They've really thought
about this thing.

873
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:49,527
They've upgraded every
component in the drivetrain

874
00:48:49,613 --> 00:48:51,998
between the engine
and the wheel.

875
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:56,056
Sometimes the metals they
were using in the car industry

876
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,967
weren't strong enough
to take the forces involved,

877
00:48:59,053 --> 00:49:01,892
so they went to
the aeronautical industry.

878
00:49:02,713 --> 00:49:05,829
0-60, less than 3.5 seconds.

879
00:49:08,976 --> 00:49:12,400
Top speed, 180 miles an hour.

880
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,267
It's...

881
00:49:17,493 --> 00:49:20,595
This is a 2.5-ton
off-roader!

882
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:24,548
And because
it's four-wheel-drive,

883
00:49:24,634 --> 00:49:27,048
it can apply
those 700 horsepower

884
00:49:27,204 --> 00:49:29,268
much, much more effectively

885
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:32,079
than the two-wheel-drive
Challenger and Demon cars.

886
00:49:39,593 --> 00:49:41,766
The world, in no way,
needs this.

887
00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:44,532
But that's kind of why
the world needs it.

888
00:49:50,753 --> 00:49:54,438
I've chosen this Cadillac
because it's comfortable.

889
00:49:57,713 --> 00:50:01,368
I mean, it will do 200 miles an
hour and it has 640 horsepower,

890
00:50:01,453 --> 00:50:05,308
but mainly it's comfortable.

891
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:07,328
Oh, there's a dip
in the road.

892
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:09,848
But the Cadillac
just soaks it up.

893
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:11,673
Mmm.

894
00:50:14,793 --> 00:50:18,278
Things were rather
different, however, in my car.

895
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:22,068
The swan song Corvette.

896
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:26,078
Bloody hellfire!

897
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:32,928
It's called the ZR1 and it's
the loudest, fastest,

898
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:36,048
most powerful Corvette ever.

899
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,553
Ah.

900
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:43,558
Oh, ho-ho-ho!

901
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:50,478
You get 755 horsepower.

902
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:54,268
715 torques.

903
00:50:54,353 --> 00:50:58,238
Does 0-60 in 2.8 seconds.

904
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:05,668
Now, that's all down to
what GM calls the BAS.

905
00:51:05,753 --> 00:51:08,338
The Big Ass Supercharger.

906
00:51:10,713 --> 00:51:14,308
It takes 110 horsepower
just to run it,

907
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:17,248
but you get
290 horsepower back,

908
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:20,111
so it's a good deal.

909
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:26,400
This engine runs on a type of fuel you
can't even buy in California any more,

910
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:30,328
and needs 13 radiators
to keep it cool,

911
00:51:30,564 --> 00:51:32,348
especially here.

912
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:35,955
Where are we? What,
ten miles from Death Valley?

913
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:40,588
It is, I'm afraid, though...

914
00:51:40,673 --> 00:51:43,208
Ooh, shit!

915
00:51:43,293 --> 00:51:46,788
a tricky little bastard.

916
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:53,431
It's got a huge amount of mechanical
and invisible aerodynamic grip,

917
00:51:53,564 --> 00:51:56,779
which is fine if you want
to set a lap record.

918
00:51:57,633 --> 00:52:00,662
The trouble is,
if you go beyond the limit,

919
00:52:00,748 --> 00:52:03,889
it becomes almost
unbelievably difficult...

920
00:52:05,613 --> 00:52:07,568
to control.

921
00:52:07,653 --> 00:52:09,584
Look at it.

922
00:52:11,756 --> 00:52:15,756
Last year,
an executive vice president

923
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:17,842
of something or other
at General Motors...

924
00:52:17,951 --> 00:52:21,208
I won't say his name,
just that it begins with M

925
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:23,508
and ends in ark Reuss...

926
00:52:23,709 --> 00:52:25,048
he was driving one of these

927
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:28,389
as the pace car
at the Indy race in Detroit,

928
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:29,970
and he got to
the second corner

929
00:52:30,056 --> 00:52:33,371
before he lost control
and put it in a wall.

930
00:52:36,793 --> 00:52:40,342
Everybody laughed at him and everybody's
looked at his crash on YouTube,

931
00:52:40,428 --> 00:52:44,296
but the fact is,
I feel your pain, Mark.

932
00:52:44,713 --> 00:52:47,484
Jesus.

933
00:52:48,353 --> 00:52:50,508
Oooh.

934
00:52:50,593 --> 00:52:53,048
Rather worryingly,
Hammond then announced

935
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:55,638
that we should have
a drifting competition.

936
00:52:58,993 --> 00:53:01,848
OK, this is gonna be
something else, isn't it?

937
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:05,368
But, because he's a moron,
he hadn't factored in

938
00:53:05,453 --> 00:53:09,238
that he was driving
a boxy and wobbly 4X4.

939
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:14,728
And a little touch
on the brake, throw it in,

940
00:53:14,813 --> 00:53:18,478
instigating an absolutely
beautiful drift.

941
00:53:21,993 --> 00:53:23,888
- Oh, I don't know.
- Look.

942
00:53:23,973 --> 00:53:25,678
What's he trying to do?

943
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:30,528
That was a bit violent.

944
00:53:35,473 --> 00:53:38,388
It lacks the predictability

945
00:53:38,473 --> 00:53:41,548
of a lower,
rear-wheel drive car.

946
00:53:41,633 --> 00:53:44,848
I'm not blaming the car,
because the car's wonderful.

947
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:48,428
But it's the car.

948
00:53:48,513 --> 00:53:51,208
With Hammond
having scored nought,

949
00:53:51,293 --> 00:53:54,468
it was my turn,
in the mental mobile.

950
00:53:55,893 --> 00:53:58,648
And then flick it round.

951
00:54:01,513 --> 00:54:03,968
No drifting at all.
That's just driving around.

952
00:54:04,053 --> 00:54:07,015
Right, now come on,
Jeremy, turn it in.

953
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:13,508
Oh, hello! Oh, no!

954
00:54:13,593 --> 00:54:15,828
That's spinning.

955
00:54:15,913 --> 00:54:17,928
So he needs to find
a sort of happy medium

956
00:54:18,013 --> 00:54:20,008
between spinning
and simply driving along.

957
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:21,984
That's pretty much what
drifting is, isn't it?

958
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,228
Yeah.

959
00:54:23,313 --> 00:54:25,568
Would you like to get
a cup of coffee or something?

960
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:27,988
I'm sure I'll get it
worked out in a minute.

961
00:54:28,073 --> 00:54:30,088
This is the problem.
He doesn't bore easily.

962
00:54:30,173 --> 00:54:32,695
Right, now come on, Jeremy,
come on!

963
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:36,678
I kept trying.

964
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:39,908
No.

965
00:54:39,993 --> 00:54:41,937
No, I'm gonna go back. I'm...

966
00:54:45,233 --> 00:54:47,358
What is he doing?

967
00:54:48,273 --> 00:54:50,318
Oh, hell!

968
00:54:51,673 --> 00:54:53,838
Oh, yes, that's not
gone brilliantly.

969
00:54:56,233 --> 00:55:00,179
How do you score this,
apart from not very highly?

970
00:55:02,528 --> 00:55:04,173
No, I've gone again.

971
00:55:05,413 --> 00:55:07,390
Until eventually...

972
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:09,628
Fire. Fire.

973
00:55:09,713 --> 00:55:11,257
Small fire.

974
00:55:15,233 --> 00:55:18,388
That clutch?
I think it's clutch.

975
00:55:18,921 --> 00:55:21,015
Nothing... Nothing to see.

976
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,562
After my car was put out,

977
00:55:24,713 --> 00:55:27,188
it was the turn
of William Wordsworth.

978
00:55:27,273 --> 00:55:29,448
What we've got here
is a drifting competition

979
00:55:29,533 --> 00:55:31,488
featuring two cars
that can't drift

980
00:55:31,573 --> 00:55:32,988
and a third which can,

981
00:55:33,073 --> 00:55:36,007
but which is being driven
by a man who can't.

982
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:38,848
The only good thing is
he'll do it once, very badly,

983
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:40,668
there'll be a chirp of tyres,

984
00:55:40,827 --> 00:55:42,208
he'll think that was a drift

985
00:55:42,293 --> 00:55:43,988
and then we can
move on.

986
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:45,528
Did you see me drift?

987
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:57,062
- Un-James May start there.
- Very exuberant start.

988
00:56:02,273 --> 00:56:04,945
Hang on a minute!

989
00:56:14,873 --> 00:56:17,015
- Impossible.
- Unexpected.

990
00:56:17,101 --> 00:56:18,328
- Impossible.
- Unlikely.

991
00:56:18,413 --> 00:56:22,241
Impossible.
Hold on, where's he going?

992
00:56:22,327 --> 00:56:25,422
That's the pit lane. He's going
the wrong way down the pit lane.

993
00:56:26,062 --> 00:56:28,317
Is that...
Is that James down there...

994
00:56:28,445 --> 00:56:29,848
What's he...

995
00:56:30,156 --> 00:56:32,908
- He's left the track.
- Hello!

996
00:56:32,993 --> 00:56:36,268
The only tall building for
miles around and he's...

997
00:56:36,353 --> 00:56:38,390
- That's not even...
- Where's he going?

998
00:56:38,484 --> 00:56:40,195
I don't know.

999
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:43,348
- Why are you not in that?
- I cheated.

1000
00:56:43,773 --> 00:56:45,585
- How did you cheat?
- I was at the pits

1001
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,008
and I met a bloke hanging around,
who said he was a drifter,

1002
00:56:48,093 --> 00:56:49,918
so I sent him out in the car.

1003
00:56:51,996 --> 00:56:54,577
You do know "drifter",
in America,

1004
00:56:54,663 --> 00:56:57,484
means something
entirely different to the UK?

1005
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,928
- Yeah.
- You've just given your car away.

1006
00:56:59,013 --> 00:57:00,718
- To a tramp.
- Yeah.

1007
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:05,139
- There he goes.
- What good work.

1008
00:57:05,372 --> 00:57:07,499
Well thought out.

1009
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:12,128
Leaving May to deal
with the insurance issues,

1010
00:57:12,213 --> 00:57:15,468
Hammond and I
headed back to the campsite,

1011
00:57:15,553 --> 00:57:18,478
which meant passing
through a local town.

1012
00:57:29,873 --> 00:57:33,484
I'll tell you what,
Hammond, do you fancy a beer?

1013
00:57:33,788 --> 00:57:35,695
Yeah,
they'll have a bar here.

1014
00:57:35,812 --> 00:57:37,428
Yeah, they must do.

1015
00:57:37,513 --> 00:57:40,734
Just the one,
though, eh? Let's not go mad.

1016
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:16,518
I am a golden god!

1017
00:58:17,353 --> 00:58:19,918
Turn that **** music off!

1018
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:26,728
I'm gonna go left!
I'm gonna go right!

1019
00:58:50,913 --> 00:58:53,288
Have you made breakfast
for yourself again?

1020
00:58:53,373 --> 00:58:57,868
Yes, I have. And I've decided
what we're doing today.

1021
00:58:57,953 --> 00:59:00,048
- What?
- We're going to Red Lake.

1022
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,568
Oh, good, I can get
my jet ski out.

1023
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:05,204
No, you can't. It's
a dried-up lake. Beautiful.

1024
00:59:06,913 --> 00:59:09,468
- Is it off-road to get there?
- All the way.

1025
00:59:09,553 --> 00:59:11,328
That means
I can drive from the roof.

1026
00:59:11,413 --> 00:59:14,454
But I have got to go
and attach all the...

1027
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:17,439
um... you know,
the stuff upstairs.

1028
00:59:17,525 --> 00:59:19,148
Right.
While you do that,

1029
00:59:19,233 --> 00:59:22,408
Adam Ant can clean himself up
and I'll enjoy my breakfast.

1030
00:59:22,493 --> 00:59:26,322
Then... that goes up there.

1031
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:29,376
And that slots into there.

1032
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,540
Brake linkages.

1033
00:59:32,626 --> 00:59:35,111
Goes in there. Yeah.

1034
00:59:35,353 --> 00:59:38,308
Bit Heath Robinson,
but it'll work.

1035
00:59:38,697 --> 00:59:41,721
Oh, mate, you missed
a hell of a party.

1036
00:59:41,807 --> 00:59:43,462
I was aware of it.

1037
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:45,988
Why didn't you come to the party?
You would have loved it.

1038
00:59:46,073 --> 00:59:48,288
You like dancing.
There was definitely dancing.

1039
00:59:48,373 --> 00:59:49,822
I think there was
a live band.

1040
00:59:49,908 --> 00:59:51,343
I was already in bed.

1041
00:59:51,429 --> 00:59:54,507
Good. So, starting engine.

1042
00:59:57,073 --> 00:59:59,748
Engaging drive. Here we go.

1043
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:03,288
There must have been 30 or 40 people
in the room when the police arrived.

1044
01:00:03,373 --> 01:00:05,758
Ohh!

1045
01:00:09,953 --> 01:00:11,753
Clarkson!

1046
01:00:19,273 --> 01:00:23,038
Oh, mate,
it landed jam-side down.

1047
01:00:27,233 --> 01:00:30,838
Once the flotsam and
jetsam had been cleared away,

1048
01:00:32,513 --> 01:00:34,918
we set off for Red Lake.

1049
01:00:36,673 --> 01:00:40,358
Hammond and May decided
to go as the crow flies.

1050
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:46,088
Whereas I took
the longer route...

1051
01:00:47,593 --> 01:00:49,838
on a gentle track.

1052
01:00:50,753 --> 01:00:53,078
Oh, this is just heaven.

1053
01:00:54,473 --> 01:00:57,078
A lavatory
with a flying bridge.

1054
01:00:58,233 --> 01:01:00,988
I mean, what I've done here
is I have turned

1055
01:01:01,073 --> 01:01:04,368
one of the most dreary driving
experiences in the world

1056
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:06,678
into one of the best.

1057
01:01:08,313 --> 01:01:11,478
I honestly believe that
sometimes my genius...

1058
01:01:12,473 --> 01:01:14,758
it generates gravity.

1059
01:01:17,113 --> 01:01:20,168
Meanwhile,
on the rougher route...

1060
01:01:20,253 --> 01:01:22,348
Oh...

1061
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:25,088
James, I'm not sure
about this.

1062
01:01:25,173 --> 01:01:28,428
Well,
it's the shortest way.

1063
01:01:28,513 --> 01:01:31,688
I know this may look a bit mad but
people obviously do this in RVs,

1064
01:01:31,773 --> 01:01:34,448
cos you see them parked
out in the middle of nowhere.

1065
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:37,188
Even if it's only
making meth.

1066
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:41,128
However, soon the terrain
started to get much rougher.

1067
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:49,953
Shit!

1068
01:01:56,153 --> 01:01:57,878
Come on, come on.

1069
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:03,248
Come on, come on, come on!

1070
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:05,598
Ahhh, ha-ha!

1071
01:02:12,993 --> 01:02:14,998
Argh! Argh!

1072
01:02:17,413 --> 01:02:19,558
Woah! Shit!

1073
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:26,228
Hammond,
your bike's fallen off.

1074
01:02:26,494 --> 01:02:28,568
Oh, bloody hell,
I'll go back and get it.

1075
01:02:28,736 --> 01:02:31,751
Er... I wouldn't bother,
to be honest.

1076
01:02:34,073 --> 01:02:36,923
That's the... kick-start.

1077
01:02:37,009 --> 01:02:38,080
The exhaust is wedged
under the back wheel.

1078
01:02:38,165 --> 01:02:39,681
The kick-starter's come off.

1079
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:41,967
The handlebars are bent,
the fork's twisted.

1080
01:02:42,053 --> 01:02:43,228
Foot peg.

1081
01:02:43,313 --> 01:02:45,548
It's broken
the two-stroke oil...

1082
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:50,078
I'm really sorry you won't be able to
ride it around tonight. That's a shame.

1083
01:02:53,873 --> 01:02:55,988
Going right.

1084
01:02:58,213 --> 01:02:59,868
Going left.

1085
01:02:59,953 --> 01:03:02,648
Everything is working well.

1086
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:09,095
Quite rattly, I admit.

1087
01:03:13,313 --> 01:03:15,968
Er... nasty, that...

1088
01:03:16,053 --> 01:03:17,668
Uuurrhhh...

1089
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:20,621
That's the collapsed
rear suspension.

1090
01:03:22,153 --> 01:03:24,668
Don't judge me.

1091
01:03:24,753 --> 01:03:26,248
Back on our trail,

1092
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:28,688
the going wasn't getting
any smoother.

1093
01:03:35,841 --> 01:03:37,541
Jesus!

1094
01:03:39,703 --> 01:03:43,422
Hammond, stop!
My pub's exploded.

1095
01:03:45,774 --> 01:03:48,156
Oh, no!

1096
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:51,948
- Oh, jeez.
- Ha!

1097
01:03:52,033 --> 01:03:54,448
Your one pleasure has been
taken away from you.

1098
01:03:54,533 --> 01:03:57,320
- That's my warm brown beer.
- Gone!

1099
01:03:57,589 --> 01:04:00,304
- Oh, God.
- Is the gin OK?

1100
01:04:00,413 --> 01:04:02,461
- Yes.
- Ha-ha-ha!

1101
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:06,588
Do you know my pub?
You're barred.

1102
01:04:06,673 --> 01:04:09,928
Figuring there was nothing
important left to break...

1103
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,958
we soldiered on.

1104
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:16,808
God, it's hot. The steering
wheel's getting...

1105
01:04:18,993 --> 01:04:21,248
Hammond,
my windscreen's falling out.

1106
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:23,288
It's fallen... It's broken.

1107
01:04:28,673 --> 01:04:29,688
Oh!

1108
01:04:29,773 --> 01:04:31,788
Oh, dear.

1109
01:04:31,873 --> 01:04:35,408
You know you're gonna have to take
the rest of it out, don't you?

1110
01:04:35,493 --> 01:04:37,728
Well, you are. You can't...

1111
01:04:37,813 --> 01:04:41,238
I mean, that's not...
advisable, is it?

1112
01:04:42,033 --> 01:04:45,318
No. Thank you for your input.

1113
01:04:49,473 --> 01:04:51,128
What I've done,
is I've taken out

1114
01:04:51,213 --> 01:04:52,808
the good half
of the windscreen

1115
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:55,168
before it falls out
and gets broken,

1116
01:04:55,253 --> 01:04:57,228
and I've stowed that
in the back

1117
01:04:57,313 --> 01:04:59,768
until I get somewhere where
I can do a proper repair.

1118
01:04:59,853 --> 01:05:02,408
And then I've borrowed
Hammond's motorcycle goggles,

1119
01:05:02,493 --> 01:05:04,438
cos he doesn't
need them any more.

1120
01:05:07,313 --> 01:05:11,998
Eventually, all three of us were
reunited at our destination...

1121
01:05:13,193 --> 01:05:15,113
Red Lake.

1122
01:05:18,433 --> 01:05:22,628
Any problems to report, apart from the
fact most of your RV's missing, May?

1123
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:25,838
No, everything's fine. The
air conditioning's excellent.

1124
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:32,198
What an astonishing lake
this is.

1125
01:05:34,633 --> 01:05:37,688
There must have been global
warming in the olden days

1126
01:05:37,773 --> 01:05:41,278
to have created this
astonishing spectacle.

1127
01:05:42,753 --> 01:05:46,238
What caused the global
warming back then, I wonder?

1128
01:05:48,313 --> 01:05:50,888
This is like a scene
out of Independence Day.

1129
01:05:50,973 --> 01:05:54,398
Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith,
that drunk man.

1130
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:57,668
Yeah, that's pretty much us.

1131
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:00,568
Hammond, did you do that
on the back of May's?

1132
01:06:00,653 --> 01:06:02,308
Yes, I did.

1133
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:04,308
A pub needs a name and a sign

1134
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:06,968
and I've combined it
with the landlord's name.

1135
01:06:07,053 --> 01:06:09,599
Love your work.

1136
01:06:10,075 --> 01:06:13,513
Bit of a bump there.

1137
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,693
Ha-ha! Jet ski's fallen off!

1138
01:06:20,829 --> 01:06:23,146
I probably should
tell him, but...

1139
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,388
my radio's on the seat
down there

1140
01:06:25,473 --> 01:06:27,608
and it would be irresponsible
to take my hand off the wheel.

1141
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:31,873
Before I tell him about that, I'll help
him along with it a bit. Here we go.

1142
01:06:41,193 --> 01:06:44,368
James must have a problem with
his brakes, cos he can't stop

1143
01:06:44,453 --> 01:06:47,638
and keeps hitting
the back of the jet ski.

1144
01:06:49,313 --> 01:06:52,468
Oh! Oh, dear, oh, dear.

1145
01:06:52,553 --> 01:06:55,718
Oh. it doesn't work
so well on sand.

1146
01:06:59,927 --> 01:07:02,904
Clarkson, your jet
ski's fallen off. Just then.

1147
01:07:03,013 --> 01:07:05,451
- What?
- Just then...

1148
01:07:05,552 --> 01:07:07,878
Slowing it down.
Easing it down.

1149
01:07:09,753 --> 01:07:11,348
- Is it broken?
- Oh, yes.

1150
01:07:11,433 --> 01:07:13,668
I had to swerve
like mad to avoid it.

1151
01:07:13,753 --> 01:07:15,427
It's a good job
I was behind you.

1152
01:07:15,513 --> 01:07:16,608
If there was nobody
to see that,

1153
01:07:16,693 --> 01:07:18,498
you could have
dragged that for 50 miles.

1154
01:07:18,584 --> 01:07:21,967
- How long have I been dragging it for?
- 20, 30 feet.

1155
01:07:22,053 --> 01:07:25,763
James, I can see
where it fell off.

1156
01:07:26,553 --> 01:07:29,008
And I'm gonna guess
that's three miles ago.

1157
01:07:31,073 --> 01:07:33,238
I couldn't get my radio.

1158
01:07:34,753 --> 01:07:37,718
Having cut
the ruined jet ski free,

1159
01:07:41,393 --> 01:07:44,758
we resumed our journey
across the lake bed.

1160
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:52,438
Gotta open the pub
in ten minutes.

1161
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:59,008
Hey, Priscilla, is
it nice and breezy up there?

1162
01:08:05,193 --> 01:08:09,708
Oh, going for the relaxed, easy
driving style now. There it is.

1163
01:08:09,793 --> 01:08:12,848
First time I've ever driven
with my feet up, and I like it.

1164
01:08:12,933 --> 01:08:15,808
Oh, hell!

1165
01:08:15,893 --> 01:08:17,868
Jesus Christ!

1166
01:08:17,953 --> 01:08:19,968
Might ease it down a bit.

1167
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:31,508
Shit.

1168
01:08:31,593 --> 01:08:35,988
My steering works
but I have no gears

1169
01:08:36,073 --> 01:08:39,068
and no throttle
and no braking.

1170
01:08:39,153 --> 01:08:41,678
I'm gonna have to
retake control.

1171
01:08:44,673 --> 01:08:46,508
Here we go.

1172
01:08:46,593 --> 01:08:48,398
Where's he going?

1173
01:08:49,313 --> 01:08:51,678
He's abandoned his steering!

1174
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:00,648
It's jammed!

1175
01:09:00,733 --> 01:09:02,868
What? It's...

1176
01:09:02,953 --> 01:09:04,848
It's jammed!
I can't open the hatch!

1177
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:07,118
Well, I can't open it.

1178
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:10,598
The hatch is jammed.

1179
01:09:15,673 --> 01:09:20,388
Er... guys, could you do like
a pincer movement, OK?

1180
01:09:20,473 --> 01:09:22,688
Come alongside me
at the same time

1181
01:09:22,773 --> 01:09:24,948
and try and slow me down.

1182
01:09:25,033 --> 01:09:27,648
So, what, we're gonna squeeze
you and then slow you?

1183
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:29,368
- We'll be your brakes?
- Yeah.

1184
01:09:29,453 --> 01:09:33,568
So keep steering into me while braking.
We'll try and stop it.

1185
01:09:33,653 --> 01:09:35,513
Shit.

1186
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:39,638
OK, guys, come in!

1187
01:09:40,753 --> 01:09:43,468
Roger.

1188
01:09:43,553 --> 01:09:45,718
If this works,
it'll be a miracle.

1189
01:09:48,113 --> 01:09:51,388
OK, steady. Match my speed.
Match my speed.

1190
01:09:51,473 --> 01:09:53,238
Matching your speed.

1191
01:09:56,353 --> 01:09:58,798
Steering in. Steering in.

1192
01:10:05,193 --> 01:10:07,368
OK, start to brake.
Start to brake.

1193
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,588
Braking, braking.

1194
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:13,048
OK,
this is working. This is working.

1195
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:15,008
My fuel tank
is just down there, so...

1196
01:10:16,273 --> 01:10:18,408
Right. Oh, it's worked a bit.

1197
01:10:19,753 --> 01:10:22,721
OK, that's
a small accident there.

1198
01:10:23,705 --> 01:10:25,963
Bloody hell, that worked!
It's stopped!

1199
01:10:26,093 --> 01:10:28,174
But now you've gotta
get it in neutral!

1200
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,788
- Well, how do I get in?
- I don't know.

1201
01:10:30,873 --> 01:10:33,448
There's a ladder at the back.
Go down the ladder.

1202
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:35,328
We have to shut it down!

1203
01:10:35,413 --> 01:10:36,988
It's trying to run away.

1204
01:10:37,346 --> 01:10:39,008
I've got my foot
hard on the brake.

1205
01:10:39,093 --> 01:10:41,608
If we let go,
it will take off.

1206
01:10:41,693 --> 01:10:43,237
Hurry up!

1207
01:10:46,353 --> 01:10:48,068
Right, down the back,

1208
01:10:48,153 --> 01:10:51,248
the window should be aligned with your...
Use a bar stool.

1209
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:53,398
Go to the back,
where the windows are.

1210
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:58,708
No, I can't.

1211
01:10:58,793 --> 01:11:00,848
- What do you mean, you can't?
- I can't do it.

1212
01:11:00,933 --> 01:11:03,048
- Put your feet in first.
- Hammond!

1213
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:05,948
- What?
- We need Hammond. He's little.

1214
01:11:06,033 --> 01:11:08,888
You can't get through the window.
I can't take my foot off the brake.

1215
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,848
I hope my handbrake holds, cos
if it gives out, we've had it.

1216
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:13,788
I can't get through
the window.

1217
01:11:13,873 --> 01:11:16,408
Go in there. Can you put it
in... just put it in park?

1218
01:11:16,493 --> 01:11:18,365
Turn it off.

1219
01:11:18,713 --> 01:11:21,928
- What are you doing?
- Putting that in to make it easier. Look.

1220
01:11:22,013 --> 01:11:24,528
- Oh, right, that was my problem.
- Yeah. Arghh!

1221
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,848
- I did that.
- Ow! Argh!

1222
01:11:26,933 --> 01:11:29,238
Ow! Pinched one!

1223
01:11:30,433 --> 01:11:32,008
- Right. I'm...
- Quick!

1224
01:11:36,193 --> 01:11:38,137
Neutral! Oh.

1225
01:11:38,223 --> 01:11:39,388
- Oh.
- Has he done it?

1226
01:11:39,473 --> 01:11:41,608
- Yes, he has. Jeez.
- Neutral. I've shut it down.

1227
01:11:41,693 --> 01:11:43,457
Well done.

1228
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,379
Oh, no!

1229
01:11:46,273 --> 01:11:47,328
- Hammond.
- What?

1230
01:11:47,413 --> 01:11:48,688
Do you have any idea

1231
01:11:48,773 --> 01:11:51,848
how close that fuel tank
is to my chassis rails?

1232
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:53,168
Very.

1233
01:11:53,254 --> 01:11:55,596
You could have been
blown to pieces, you idiot!

1234
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:58,370
- Er... who's the idiot?
- "Thank you, rescuers."

1235
01:11:58,456 --> 01:11:59,708
- "Who's the idiot?"
- You are.

1236
01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:02,988
Why did this happen? There was
nothing wrong with mine or his.

1237
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:04,808
What do you mean there's
nothing wrong with yours?

1238
01:12:04,893 --> 01:12:07,208
- You've got no windscreen.
- I know, but it was driving OK.

1239
01:12:07,293 --> 01:12:10,228
I was in control of it. I was behind
the wheel, I could use the pedals.

1240
01:12:10,313 --> 01:12:11,964
- I was in control of...
- No, you weren't.

1241
01:12:12,049 --> 01:12:13,768
- Of the steering I was.
- Well, that's brilliant.

1242
01:12:13,853 --> 01:12:16,807
We've saved you from being dashed
to death on a distant mountain.

1243
01:12:16,893 --> 01:12:18,728
- I can't get out.
- And this is the gratitude we get.

1244
01:12:18,813 --> 01:12:21,862
I was prepared to drive round in
circles till it ran out of petrol.

1245
01:12:21,948 --> 01:12:24,528
- What's the matter?
- I can't get out. I've got stuck.

1246
01:12:24,791 --> 01:12:27,548
This was a mistake.

1247
01:12:27,633 --> 01:12:31,188
- What's he done?
- This... I can't...

1248
01:12:31,273 --> 01:12:34,326
- What were you thinking of?
- My legs are on the glass.

1249
01:12:35,353 --> 01:12:37,561
This is a ridiculous day.

1250
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:41,125
Let's see what can be done
to rescue this situation.

1251
01:12:41,272 --> 01:12:42,607
Well, that's
an interesting one, isn't it?

1252
01:12:42,693 --> 01:12:44,186
- Well, let's have a sit down and think.
- Yeah,

1253
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:45,350
there's a sofa here.

1254
01:12:45,436 --> 01:12:47,850
My knees are stuck on
the window, it's very sore.

1255
01:12:48,133 --> 01:12:50,768
How did you manage that? Why
didn't you go through legs first?

1256
01:12:50,853 --> 01:12:52,468
I couldn't
because it's higher.

1257
01:12:52,553 --> 01:12:53,944
But didn't you take
a bar stool with you?

1258
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:54,561
Aargh!

1259
01:12:54,647 --> 01:12:56,779
Can I just say this holiday
is not working out.

1260
01:12:56,865 --> 01:13:01,160
- No.
- Why don't we just face facts?

1261
01:13:01,309 --> 01:13:04,248
- RVs are not good.
- They're not good.

1262
01:13:04,334 --> 01:13:06,780
So why don't we
just have a demolition derby?

1263
01:13:06,873 --> 01:13:08,468
- Well, no, wait a minute.
- What?

1264
01:13:08,553 --> 01:13:10,398
That's not a bad idea, cos
half of mine's gone already.

1265
01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:12,967
Yes, mine's pretty much ruined,
cos he's broken the window.

1266
01:13:13,053 --> 01:13:14,881
Yes, but mine's intact,
it's perfectly intact.

1267
01:13:14,967 --> 01:13:16,948
Nothing has gone wrong with it.
I'm not destroying it.

1268
01:13:17,033 --> 01:13:18,808
Well, you'll win, then. You
stand more chance of winning.

1269
01:13:18,893 --> 01:13:21,600
I'll tell you what,
we'll have a vote.

1270
01:13:32,113 --> 01:13:34,368
Right, we've found
three other people

1271
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:37,588
who are equally disillusioned
with their RVs

1272
01:13:37,673 --> 01:13:39,008
and the rules
are very simple.

1273
01:13:39,178 --> 01:13:42,868
The last one still running
is the winner.

1274
01:13:42,953 --> 01:13:46,368
Once we'd climbed aboard
our race-modified RVs,

1275
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:48,868
we were ready for the off.

1276
01:13:48,953 --> 01:13:51,748
This is a stupid idea.
I disapprove.

1277
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:55,078
It's needlessly destructive and
I really like my little truck.

1278
01:13:56,157 --> 01:13:58,252
Here's my start line
strategy.

1279
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:01,548
Light goes green.
Hard right! Hit James.

1280
01:14:01,633 --> 01:14:03,994
I want him to be
a bonnet emblem

1281
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,447
by the time I get to
the first corner.

1282
01:14:06,557 --> 01:14:09,008
He doesn't realise that the
window's fallen out of his RV

1283
01:14:09,093 --> 01:14:11,358
and I can hear
everything he's saying.

1284
01:14:27,953 --> 01:14:30,025
Let's get this over with,
shall we?

1285
01:14:31,953 --> 01:14:34,198
That's one done.

1286
01:14:39,953 --> 01:14:42,688
Obviously I'm not driving
on the roof.

1287
01:14:42,773 --> 01:14:45,038
I think that would be unwise.

1288
01:14:46,313 --> 01:14:48,708
Closing up on the lavatory.

1289
01:14:48,793 --> 01:14:51,008
Here he goes.

1290
01:14:51,093 --> 01:14:53,278
Oh, he hit me hard there.

1291
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:57,928
Turning right.

1292
01:14:58,013 --> 01:15:00,568
Oh, haw, haw, haw!

1293
01:15:13,753 --> 01:15:15,728
- Got him.
- I've been hit again!

1294
01:15:15,813 --> 01:15:18,118
Bastard.

1295
01:15:19,753 --> 01:15:21,768
Meanwhile,
in Hammond's truck,

1296
01:15:21,853 --> 01:15:24,128
there'd been
a bit of a mood swing.

1297
01:15:24,213 --> 01:15:26,488
Ha, ha, ha.

1298
01:15:29,002 --> 01:15:31,097
OK, I change my mind.
This is really good fun.

1299
01:15:34,993 --> 01:15:40,108
I have got the toughest vehicle here...
I'm sure of that.

1300
01:15:40,513 --> 01:15:42,478
Aargh! Oh, ow, ow.

1301
01:15:44,277 --> 01:15:46,632
Have another go at Jeremy.

1302
01:15:46,968 --> 01:15:49,893
Ooh! Oh,
my lights have come off.

1303
01:15:52,753 --> 01:15:55,208
The door was shut on me
really badly.

1304
01:15:55,293 --> 01:15:58,048
I can't see over my bonnet.

1305
01:16:01,618 --> 01:16:05,253
Hammond's bonnet
is completely off.

1306
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:07,860
However,
the Mad Max make-over

1307
01:16:07,946 --> 01:16:11,240
made his truck
even more of a lethal weapon.

1308
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,038
There you go! Hah.

1309
01:16:15,593 --> 01:16:17,888
- Ha ha ha.
- Oh, that's brutal.

1310
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:20,408
Oh, my door!

1311
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:22,314
Oh!

1312
01:16:27,673 --> 01:16:29,788
I've been hit.

1313
01:16:30,059 --> 01:16:31,944
I've been hit again.

1314
01:16:33,753 --> 01:16:35,648
I'm in a sandwich
of Americans.

1315
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:39,994
It was at this point
I noticed something

1316
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,808
about one of those Americans.

1317
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:44,988
Wait a minute.

1318
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:46,988
It's that guy.

1319
01:16:47,073 --> 01:16:49,848
He's the one
who's been following us.

1320
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:51,924
What's he doing?

1321
01:16:53,593 --> 01:16:54,928
Oh, no, I'm being pushed.

1322
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:02,568
We are being annihilated by
the two remaining Americans.

1323
01:17:08,673 --> 01:17:10,408
As the contest heated up...

1324
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,715
I decided to pick on
the biggest RV.

1325
01:17:19,112 --> 01:17:21,687
You want demolition,
have some.

1326
01:17:23,913 --> 01:17:25,033
Ha! Oh!

1327
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:35,718
Oh, oh.

1328
01:17:37,713 --> 01:17:40,009
- Oh, hello, I'm leaking.
- Oh, no!

1329
01:17:40,095 --> 01:17:42,236
Oh, no, I'm leaking fluid.

1330
01:17:46,273 --> 01:17:49,398
Following hit
after brutal hit...

1331
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:54,508
my opponent
eventually conked out.

1332
01:17:54,593 --> 01:17:58,068
But the battle had left me
badly wounded.

1333
01:17:58,537 --> 01:18:01,076
Oh, this does not bode well
for my little truck.

1334
01:18:01,162 --> 01:18:03,427
I think my engine
might be suffering.

1335
01:18:03,953 --> 01:18:05,709
Huh! Aargh!

1336
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:07,959
Oh, whoa!

1337
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:12,188
- Oh, that's
gone badly wrong for me.

1338
01:18:12,273 --> 01:18:14,528
- I think I've lost a wheel now.
- Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho.

1339
01:18:14,613 --> 01:18:16,248
I'm in a bad way.

1340
01:18:16,334 --> 01:18:18,229
I've lost steering.

1341
01:18:18,405 --> 01:18:20,780
Aaargh!

1342
01:18:21,193 --> 01:18:23,326
Hammond is history.

1343
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:27,848
Now only
three of us remained.

1344
01:18:27,933 --> 01:18:30,128
Come on. Hit James.

1345
01:18:30,213 --> 01:18:31,848
Ramming speed!

1346
01:18:38,893 --> 01:18:41,908
Ohhh!

1347
01:18:41,993 --> 01:18:44,568
- You bastard!
- May's in the wall!

1348
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:46,968
He's in the wall and toast.

1349
01:18:47,053 --> 01:18:50,249
It's just me
and this weird man.

1350
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:52,888
I'll get you, you bastard.

1351
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:55,568
Whoa.

1352
01:19:00,113 --> 01:19:02,068
Get him!

1353
01:19:02,153 --> 01:19:04,303
I'm taking him.

1354
01:19:06,073 --> 01:19:08,318
Oh, Lord.

1355
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:12,458
Going in hard and hot!

1356
01:19:21,513 --> 01:19:23,008
Yeaahhhh!

1357
01:19:23,093 --> 01:19:25,328
Ha-ha, hey!

1358
01:19:25,413 --> 01:19:27,068
Oh, yes!

1359
01:19:27,153 --> 01:19:31,062
The mighty RV boat
is victorious.

1360
01:19:31,753 --> 01:19:33,548
Nothing else running.

1361
01:19:33,633 --> 01:19:35,414
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1362
01:19:35,508 --> 01:19:36,508
Oh, yeah.

1363
01:19:36,593 --> 01:19:39,484
Well done.
It's a glorious victory.

1364
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:40,908
- Really.
- It is.

1365
01:19:40,993 --> 01:19:44,281
And I think we've proved
that if you must have an RV

1366
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:47,302
it has to be
a Chevrolet Pace Arrow.

1367
01:19:47,553 --> 01:19:48,748
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes, it does.

1368
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:50,562
Good, congratulations.
Very well done.

1369
01:19:50,648 --> 01:19:51,708
- Meanwhile...
- What?

1370
01:19:51,793 --> 01:19:53,776
We've gotta
make camp for tonight

1371
01:19:53,862 --> 01:19:56,468
in these, so I would
suggest just over there.

1372
01:19:56,635 --> 01:19:58,888
I think that's an excellent idea.
As close as possible.

1373
01:19:58,973 --> 01:20:00,748
- Yes.
- We can come to your pub.

1374
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:02,090
Well, you're not
expecting a drink,

1375
01:20:02,176 --> 01:20:03,137
- are you?
- Why not?

1376
01:20:03,223 --> 01:20:04,661
- Pub's been demolished.
- Has it?

1377
01:20:04,747 --> 01:20:06,367
- Yeah.
- Oh, of course, it went into a wall.

1378
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:08,229
- Happens a lot these days.
- Ooh! Ooh!

1379
01:20:08,315 --> 01:20:09,668
- I nearly forgot.
- What?

1380
01:20:09,753 --> 01:20:10,988
You know that guy
that's been

1381
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:12,862
following us around
since we got here?

1382
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,968
- No. - No.
- The one in the race overalls.

1383
01:20:15,053 --> 01:20:17,135
- No.
- You've still not seen him?

1384
01:20:17,221 --> 01:20:19,893
- Never seen him.
- Well, you have, cos he was driving that.

1385
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:21,586
- Was he?
- Yes, I put him on... he's dead now.

1386
01:20:21,671 --> 01:20:22,741
- Good, good.
- And now

1387
01:20:22,827 --> 01:20:24,179
he won't be
following us any more

1388
01:20:24,265 --> 01:20:26,500
- because I've rolled him over.
- You can tell us all about it

1389
01:20:26,585 --> 01:20:29,335
over a glass of water
this evening.

1390
01:20:29,851 --> 01:20:33,046
With our race
with the devil over...

1391
01:20:33,393 --> 01:20:35,708
we fell asleep
quickly that night,

1392
01:20:35,793 --> 01:20:37,999
happy in the knowledge
that the horror

1393
01:20:38,085 --> 01:20:41,624
of our RV holiday
was finally over.
