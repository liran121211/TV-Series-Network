2
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,071
Hello!

3
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:02,097
Hello, everybody!

4
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:03,668
Hel-lo!

5
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:07,847
Thank you so much.

6
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:10,308
Thank you, everybody.

7
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:11,820
Wow!

8
00:01:12,474 --> 00:01:14,043
Noisy bunch.

9
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,464
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, thank you, and welcome.

10
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,582
And in this week's show:

11
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,725
Loch...

12
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:25,866
Scot...

13
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:29,004
and two smoking Beamers.

14
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:36,394
Now...

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,066
Thanks, everybody,
thank you, thank you.

16
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:41,293
Now, I wanna begin
by talking about money.

17
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:42,700
Bear with us on this one.

18
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:46,004
You see,
if you'd put £35,000

19
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,220
in a saving account
in the year 2000,

20
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:51,152
you'd now have
around £60,000.

21
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:55,269
However, if you'd put
that same £35,000

22
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:57,180
into an E-Type Jaguar,

23
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:00,144
you'd now have £100,000.

24
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:03,660
Yeah, just about everything even
remotely rare or interesting

25
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,472
is worth a fortune
these days.

26
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:10,058
Aston Martin DB5,
that'll cost you £750,000.

27
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:13,425
Ferrari Daytona, £600,000.

28
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:17,386
A pagoda roof Mercedes SL, that'll
set you back at least 75 grand now.

29
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:19,230
Yeah, it's not just
exotic cars either.

30
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:22,238
Ford Escort Mexico, OK?
A hum-drum car.

31
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,363
That's a £60,000 thing
these days.

32
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,691
- 60 grand!
- Yeah, it is.

33
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:31,230
However, there are one or two
rare and interesting cars

34
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:33,129
that seem to have
slipped through the net,

35
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:36,738
whose prices haven't yet
gone through the ceiling.

36
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:41,082
So we decided
to get out there and see

37
00:02:41,168 --> 00:02:45,285
which of us was best at spotting
that investment opportunity.

38
00:02:45,446 --> 00:02:48,668
Exactly. So we each
bought a classic car.

39
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:51,081
And then to see which one
of us had got the best deal,

40
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,281
we took The Grand Tour to
what one of our producers,

41
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:56,601
who's Scottish,
always says is the best,

42
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:59,300
most beautiful place
on earth:

43
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,801
Scotland.

44
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,426
We chose,
for our meeting point,

45
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:13,754
a quaint fishing port
near Inverness.

46
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:18,840
And I was
the first to arrive,

47
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:22,511
in an Alfa Romeo GTV6.

48
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:25,977
Now...

49
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:29,315
you would imagine
that when one of these

50
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,148
comes onto the market,

51
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:33,949
classic car enthusiasts
are running around

52
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:38,363
like they're in a zombie
movie and it's Black Friday.

53
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,321
But, no.

54
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:44,582
I bought this
from an 83-year-old man...

55
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,185
who'd had it since new
and was only selling it

56
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:49,386
cos his 84-year-old wife

57
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:52,722
found it so difficult to get
in and out of, "you know".

58
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:55,519
It's only done 26,000 miles.

59
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:58,074
And yet it cost £10,000.

60
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,195
And £10,000 -
that's a round of drinks

61
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:04,332
in the world where
this sort of thing belongs.

62
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,014
Oh, hello.

63
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,558
James May in
a Lancia Gamma Coupe.

64
00:04:09,672 --> 00:04:13,272
That's one of the prettiest cars ever
made, but don't tell him I said that.

65
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:15,604
Morning, May.

66
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:20,238
- How much?
- £13,500.

67
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:23,400
Oh, £3,500 more...

68
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:27,080
than I paid for this
vastly superior Alfa Romeo.

69
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:29,277
Well, £13,500 is a bargain

70
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:32,566
for a car that is coach-built
and extremely rare

71
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,683
and beautiful.

72
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,590
But it isn't exotic
like this is.

73
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,472
What do you mean,
it's not exotic? Okay.

74
00:04:37,558 --> 00:04:40,371
May I just talk you through some
of this car's features, yes?

75
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:42,546
Transaxle,
gearbox at the back,

76
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:47,050
twin-plate clutch, disks all
round, unusual at the time.

77
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:49,808
One of the best engines ever
made, two-and-a-half litre V6.

78
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:51,703
Those aren't my words,
by the way, they are

79
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:53,347
the words of James
May in Car Magazine.

80
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:56,527
- Yes, I did say that. I do.
- You love this engine.

81
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,777
And this has won the European
Touring Car Championship

82
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:02,706
four years on the trot, it won the
British Touring Car Championship.

83
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,535
This has got
race breeding as well.

84
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:06,933
- What, the Gamma?
- It's a Lancia!

85
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:09,714
They're the most successful
rallying team in history.

86
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,512
Not my words,
the words of Jeremy Clarkson.

87
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:14,553
And that is
a better-looking car.

88
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:16,273
- What, than this?
- Yes!

89
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,457
- It is... superbe.
- It's not "superbe".

90
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:20,913
I tell you what's not superb.

91
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:25,175
Richard Hammond
arriving in a Fiat X19.

92
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:27,761
How much?

93
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:31,613
£2,250.

94
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,898
Somebody saw you coming,
Hammond.

95
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:36,480
What? For a baby Ferrari,
two thousand...

96
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,553
- Did you just call it a baby Ferrari?
- He did.

97
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,402
Because it is. Mid-engined,
Italian, it's exactly what it is.

98
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,504
- Ooh, listen to that sound.
- I know.

99
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,902
That is the reassuring sound
of tin on Russian steel.

100
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:52,003
It's a light, bright, effervescent
sound, just like the car.

101
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:54,283
How many colours
has this car been?

102
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:55,938
It was black,
then it was red,

103
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,692
then it was white, then it was
pale blue, and now it's purple.

104
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:00,097
I'd like to add, actually,

105
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:02,285
it's not, "How many colours
has this car been?"

106
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:05,175
- How many cars has this been?
- Well, quite.

107
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:07,222
- It's now going brown.
- Brown, yeah.

108
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:09,283
All right, then.
I'm not gonna turn around.

109
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,963
I'll try and work out
which Alfa you've bought.

110
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:15,083
- Da-nah, the best Alfa.
- Oh, it's a GTV6.

111
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,803
- Exactly!
- Yeah.

112
00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:19,300
Why has it got this plastic bit
in the middle of the bonnet?

113
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:22,722
Genius. The engine in
this car had a small issue.

114
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:25,043
It used to backf-...
well, front-fire, actually,

115
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,675
and blow the top
off the engine, yeah?

116
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,530
So that would damage
the bonnet.

117
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:32,332
So they put this plastic panel,
which was easier to replace.

118
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:34,902
Why didn't they stop it
backfiring?

119
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:36,053
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

120
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:37,808
- They were... busy.
- Lazy.

121
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:39,527
- Can I just ask?
- Hmm?

122
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:41,113
What's that broom handle
thing for?

123
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,285
Uh! Well, now this is another
characteristic of the GTV6

124
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:48,172
is that when you park up, you
need to keep the clutch pedal

125
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:50,893
depressed using
a broom handle like that.

126
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,573
- Right.
- Otherwise the clutch and the flywheel

127
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:55,332
- will fuse together.
- I see.

128
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:58,733
I used to own one of these, there's
not a lot I don't know about it.

129
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,324
Yeah. When you used to own one of
these, how did you find the gear change?

130
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,533
Um... smooth, snicky.

131
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:06,903
- No, it wasn't, was it?
- No, those aren't quite the right words.

132
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:08,800
Terrible.
What about second?

133
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,543
Yeah, second...

134
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:13,213
- I don't know, I never found it.
- No, exactly!

135
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:18,253
Yes, let's not get bogged down with
some of the Alfa's minor design flaws.

136
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,816
- Disasters.
- Because

137
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:22,173
all three of us
have got classic cars.

138
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:23,973
- I have, yes.
- For good money.

139
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,840
- Mm-hmm.
- We're in Scotland.

140
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:28,652
So why don't we take them
on a drive in...

141
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:31,213
Well, let's be honest,
Scotland is just a road trip.

142
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:35,402
I agree. We could, while
we're here, we could do the NC500.

143
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:37,824
Which, I mean, that is sup...

144
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,433
Voted by Condé Nast
Traveller magazine...

145
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,093
voted it the best road trip
in the world.

146
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:45,355
It's got lochs,
mountains, it's just...

147
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:46,723
- All the pretty bits, yeah.
- ..I mean,

148
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:48,324
It's all the best bits
of Scotland, right, - Yeah.

149
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,572
500 miles round
the north coast of Scotland.

150
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:52,072
- In Italian exotic cars.
- - Oh,

151
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:54,457
- hang on. Text.
- What?

152
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,597
Yeah? Mr Wilman.

153
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:58,498
Mr Wilman.

154
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,514
It says:

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,980
"Those cars will not do 500
yards, leave alone 500 miles."

156
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:08,133
So I've provided three backup
vehicles which you can use

157
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,972
to get home when they go
wrong and catch fire.

158
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,011
"And explode."

159
00:08:14,938 --> 00:08:17,472
- I was wondering what they were.
- Funny.

160
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:20,449
How did he know we were
going to do 500 miles?

161
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:23,754
That's a good point, actually, cos
Hammond's only just suggested it.

162
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:26,549
How did he know that?
How did he get three bicycles...

163
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:31,413
Putting Mr Wilman's
psychic powers to one side,

164
00:08:31,498 --> 00:08:32,653
we climbed aboard...

165
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:38,333
and set off
into the giant oil painting

166
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,418
that is Scotland.

167
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,340
Oh.

168
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,215
This isn't exactly like the tourist
authority would have you believe, is it?

169
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:05,355
It doesn't look like it looks

170
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:07,597
on the shortbread tins.

171
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:09,574
This render that they
put on everything is

172
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,090
like a sort of batter
for houses, isn't it?

173
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:15,288
Batter!

174
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:17,675
"I've battered my house."

175
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,591
You can see why they
want to be independent,

176
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:22,191
can't you? Get away from us lot.

177
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:25,552
Well, you wouldn't want people coming
in and messing all this up, would you?

178
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:30,152
I used to have a fiercely
Scottish neighbour in London.

179
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:33,261
Why would a Scottish
person go and live in London?

180
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:35,847
I dunno, because he'd
do anything for Scotland.

181
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:37,449
Well, except live there.

182
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,121
Was he called Sean Connery?

183
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:44,346
Eventually,
we cleared the fishing port

184
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:47,229
and found ourselves
on the open road,

185
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:48,893
where we could get
down to the business

186
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:52,896
of enjoying our
pedigree Italian classics.

187
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,542
And the Fiat.

188
00:09:56,585 --> 00:10:01,487
My car is just so
refined and sophisticated.

189
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:05,080
And in fact, really well looked
after by its previous owner.

190
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,987
It was obviously loved and...

191
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:12,573
One of my windscreen wipers
just fell off.

192
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,232
Oh, dear!

193
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,284
- He can't get out.
- I can't get out.

194
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:24,573
We can only just lift it up,
there you go.

195
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,135
You just have to
drive like that.

196
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:28,166
James, can I just say,
you've done three miles.

197
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,682
There, it's mended for now.
Don't turn it on again.

198
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:33,058
Just turn it on,
I want to see what happens.

199
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:34,205
OK.

200
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:36,933
Ready?

201
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:41,432
- In Scotland?
- In Scotland, you won't need it,

202
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:42,714
- that's the thing.
- Perfect.

203
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,950
Cos it never rains.

204
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:55,893
Right, now we're alone,
viewers,

205
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:59,823
I can reveal that that windscreen wiper
incident is really a bit of an aside

206
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,393
compared with some of the
other problems this car has.

207
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,909
Most of these
relate to the engine.

208
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,013
In particular,
the way Lancia mounted

209
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:12,127
the power steering pump on the
end of one of the cam shafts.

210
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:15,292
Basically, you can't
really use full lock,

211
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:18,604
especially when the engine's cold,
otherwise the engine will explode.

212
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:20,729
The thermostat was fitted
in the wrong place,

213
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:23,173
which leads to overheating,
very suddenly

214
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:25,041
and then the engine
can explode.

215
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:27,173
And there were some problems
with the gasket materials,

216
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:29,493
which causes the coolant
to mix with the oil

217
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:33,104
with engine-exploding
sort of results, really.

218
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:37,950
James, I heard Wednesdays
can cause your car to explode.

219
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,253
So you need to be
careful tomorrow.

220
00:11:40,338 --> 00:11:43,773
Proximity to trees,
lakes, grass,

221
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:46,253
heather, grouse, or tartan.

222
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,612
All those things cause it
to explode, I'm sure.

223
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:52,373
Look, I'm sitting here trying
to explain to the viewers

224
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,933
why the engine might explode
and I'm constantly

225
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:57,413
interrupted with your stupid
exploding engine jokes.

226
00:11:57,498 --> 00:12:00,943
OK, carry on, but do it quickly
before the engine explodes.

227
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,893
Meanwhile, in the GTV6...

228
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,153
Ooh, no, what's that?

229
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:09,943
That third?
Right, good, third.

230
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:15,534
Fourth? Yeah, fourth.

231
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:17,873
Or is it fourth or second?

232
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:23,213
I was getting reacquainted with
all the peculiar little foibles.

233
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:25,565
Driving position's
not brilliant.

234
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,198
Pedals are far too close
to the seat,

235
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:30,948
so you have to drive with
your legs wide apart.

236
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,413
Not so bad if you're a man.

237
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:34,932
If you're a girl, though,

238
00:12:35,018 --> 00:12:39,103
trousers is a strategy you need
to think about in a morning.

239
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,252
However,
despite all the weirdness,

240
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:46,479
I do still absolutely love
this thing.

241
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:51,143
It was my ownership of a GTV6

242
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,901
that taught me
what cars are all about.

243
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:55,558
You need a personality,

244
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:58,909
you need flaws
for them to be human.

245
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:02,744
And James May was right for
the first time in his life,

246
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,604
and only time in his life:

247
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,455
this is one of the greatest
engines ever made.

248
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,178
The creamiest,
the smoothest...

249
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,416
and the most beautiful
to listen to.

250
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:19,376
That's not exhaust noise.

251
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:22,877
That's an actual engine.

252
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:26,297
As James and I enjoyed
our classic thoroughbreds,

253
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:30,041
Richard was driving along
in his purple Fiat.

254
00:13:30,427 --> 00:13:33,291
Unleash 80 horsepower.

255
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:42,113
Well, I mean, this thing
only weighs 960 kilos.

256
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:46,104
Fiat sold 170,000 X19s,

257
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,657
so this doesn't have rarity
like theirs does.

258
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:54,221
But let's contrast rarity with
the opposite, which is popularity.

259
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:58,268
Cos that's what this car was,
immensely popular.

260
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:02,177
And I have
the pop-up head lamps.

261
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,799
Oh, yeah!

262
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:07,104
I'm gonna pop them down
again now.

263
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,315
I can do
that whenever I want!

264
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:14,440
One slight complaint
about the Fiat,

265
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:18,385
the pedals are very, very
small and very close together.

266
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:21,916
And if you try and operate them
with, let's say, your feet,

267
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:24,760
you'll find that
your feet are too big.

268
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:28,338
Really, you just need
to use a toe on each.

269
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:35,659
Soon,
Hammond spotted a racetrack

270
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:38,502
and suggested
we have a go on it.

271
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,291
And as we pulled up,
it became clear

272
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:46,143
that tiny pedals
weren't his only problem.

273
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:58,369
That's quite high revs.
Yeah, it idles quite high.

274
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:00,338
- Is that its idle speed?
- Yes.

275
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:02,124
It's keen!

276
00:15:04,842 --> 00:15:07,651
Since this was
actually a go-cart track,

277
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:10,232
it was too narrow
for car racing.

278
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:14,518
So I decided we should have
a drifting competition.

279
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,721
Come on, little Fiat.

280
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:27,177
It doesn't work.

281
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:32,728
It simply doesn't really
have the power to...

282
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:35,901
throw its tail out
properly.

283
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,217
Even though my Alfa had
twice the horsepower of the Fiat,

284
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:44,784
things weren't great
for me either.

285
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:49,917
You can't unstick
the tail of a GTV6.

286
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:52,367
You just can't. Ready?

287
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:55,367
Just grip and more grip.

288
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:03,502
I know Roger Moore drifted
a GTV6 in Octopussy.

289
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:06,080
But then he crashed
into a fence

290
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,612
and had to dress up
as a clown.

291
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:13,487
In the Gamma,
I was confident

292
00:16:13,642 --> 00:16:16,807
I'd succeed where
my colleagues had failed.

293
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:19,517
Right, here we go.

294
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:21,909
Lancia is one of the greatest
names in rallying history,

295
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:25,573
so a controlled drift should
be second nature to this.

296
00:16:25,722 --> 00:16:28,916
As I approach that corner,
I'll heel and toe it and...

297
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:34,612
Hm.

298
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,209
Brake, lift-off.

299
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,526
Nope.

300
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:46,007
At this point, I suddenly
remembered something important.

301
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:47,534
This is front-wheel drive,
isn't it?

302
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,338
What was I thinking of?

303
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,838
It's not gonna drift.

304
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:58,526
Happily, though, the enthralled local
audience were able to find a solution.

305
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:01,127
What I do is,
I take the rear wheels off,

306
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:04,299
let the tyres down and put
these plastic covers on.

307
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:06,637
Then pump the tyres back up
again, put them back on,

308
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:09,557
that gives the car the loose
back end you want to drift.

309
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,981
These are just... this is like
putting insulating tape

310
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,607
on the back wheels
of your Scalextric cars.

311
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,387
Stand by.

312
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:21,096
With no help from anyone else
on this freezing day,

313
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:23,494
the drift covers
were soon fitted.

314
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,508
Oh, here we go.

315
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,860
Oh!

316
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,360
Right, turn in...

317
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:39,741
get the drift going,
then...

318
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:47,847
This entertainment
went on for quite some time.

319
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:05,948
No.

320
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,007
Until eventually...

321
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:11,516
Dab of brakes, in.

322
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:14,696
- Hold it, hold it!
- He turned the steering wheel!

323
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:17,377
- He turned the steering wheel!
- He did a thing to it.

324
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:19,086
Ye-e-es!

325
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:21,497
Yes, yes, yes.

326
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:25,220
This looks like a lot of fun.

327
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:26,853
We're gonna do that.
We've gotta try it.

328
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:28,788
Oh, no, there's the only set.

329
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:29,914
What, of those things?

330
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,724
Yeah, they're the only
set, so we can't do it.

331
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:33,474
No, we can...
We can make some.

332
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:41,533
Did you ask if you could
borrow this bit?

333
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,525
No, but they won't need it.

334
00:18:45,562 --> 00:18:47,887
- And rotate.
- Aaaah...

335
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:51,424
This goes over.

336
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:53,457
It'll require
a little bit of persuasion.

337
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,017
James May just drifted
perfectly behind you.

338
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,407
This is another
of those weird days.

339
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,937
With his tyre covers made,

340
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:03,967
Hammond decided
not to hold back.

341
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:14,341
Oh, this is gonna be...

342
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:17,018
I mean, seriously, he's gonna
get to that corner, then...

343
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,235
Where can
the helicopter land?

344
00:19:24,842 --> 00:19:26,817
Here comes a drift,
here it comes.

345
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:29,557
And drifting.

346
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:31,597
Agh!

347
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:33,617
Completely out of control.

348
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:39,629
Let's just try again.

349
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:44,617
All right, one of them...
no, that's fallen off.

350
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:46,361
That could be interesting.

351
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,796
And I am turning in.
Drifting.

352
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:55,533
Oh, no, I'm, no, there's...
I've got steering.

353
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:01,297
Annoyingly, Hammond's
dismal failure didn't stop him

354
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:05,072
fitting his ridiculous
contraptions to my precious Alfa.

355
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:08,557
And insisting
that I have a go.

356
00:20:08,902 --> 00:20:12,436
Think of the trouble
Alfa Romeo went to

357
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:14,002
to make this car exquisite.

358
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,940
Think of the trouble
that Pirelli went to

359
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,385
to make the tyres
grip properly.

360
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:22,650
And then along comes
Hammond with a bin.

361
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,364
Whatever, here we go.

362
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:34,861
What was that noise?

363
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,084
Whole car's vibrating.

364
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:42,768
Yeah,
that's a massive vibration.

365
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,412
Hammond,
you blithering idiot,

366
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:47,803
you've totally ruined
this car!

367
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:53,932
An inspection of the undersides
revealed some grim news.

368
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:57,377
That has come off.
So the prop shaft is now...

369
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,635
Well, it's still
joining the gearbox

370
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:03,016
or the transaxle to the
engine, but by a thread.

371
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:06,489
And if I did anything more that rev
it like that, it's gonna come off.

372
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:09,870
If I'm driving along, then
that's the end of the Alfa.

373
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:11,330
Well, that's interesting.

374
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,431
Uh... my car's working
and I'd like a drink.

375
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:16,213
The hotel is about
25 miles away.

376
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,494
So, I think I'll get on
with it, if you don't mind.

377
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:20,729
You can't leave...
No, you can't leave me now.

378
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,173
What do you mean,
I can't leave you now?

379
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:26,072
Have you seen...
Have you seen how cold it is?

380
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:27,791
I can't see how cold it is,

381
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:29,852
but I can feel it.
No, but, I actually just looked.

382
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:32,135
"Drizzle 6, feels like 2."

383
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:34,011
- Well, you know what would warm you up?
- What?

384
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:36,939
A bicycle ride.
It always does.

385
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:45,252
20 miles through this...

386
00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:48,861
freezing middle
of nowhere.

387
00:21:48,947 --> 00:21:52,189
Hey, Richard the hamster Hammond,
is your car warm and dry?

388
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,314
I'm just checking.

389
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,150
Yeah, I'm warm and dry.
You warm and dry?

390
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:57,258
I'm very warm and dry.

391
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:11,537
Oh, I meant to ask, would you like a
long gin and tonic sitting at a barstool?

392
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:12,924
Yes. Yes, I would.

393
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,627
And we've only got...
Well, it's not far in a car!

394
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:21,230
Oh, God.

395
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:23,356
Oh, come on!

396
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,963
Rub it in!
Seriously, rub it in!

397
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,127
We're gonna need
to rehearse it.

398
00:22:38,213 --> 00:22:40,338
- What?
- Well, what we're saying.

399
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:43,439
Look, so we're
on breakfast TV,

400
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:44,839
- you're on the sofa, yeah?
- Oh, OK.

401
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:47,340
"Good morning and with me
is James May..." That's how they speak.

402
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:50,080
"Who has just learnt of
the sad demise"

403
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,752
of his co-host and colleague,
Mr Jeremy Clarkson.

404
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,064
James, how do you feel
that his body was found

405
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,807
in a ditch
with a bicycle this morning?

406
00:22:56,924 --> 00:22:58,437
- Was it?
- Yes.

407
00:22:58,522 --> 00:22:59,592
- No, that's not right, is it? Sorry,
- No,

408
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:00,678
- can you do that again?
- James

409
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:04,077
This is radio, OK? "Good morning,
five past nine, James May is with us."

410
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:06,533
Uh... we only learnt this
morning of the sad demise of..."

411
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,554
- Oh, bugger.
- What?

412
00:23:08,842 --> 00:23:11,817
All of that rehearsing, mate,
waste of time.

413
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:14,911
Because he's outside
right now,

414
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:18,072
fighting with a bicycle lock
by a fence.

415
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:19,510
Oh, you look cold!

416
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:20,713
Who's cold?

417
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,274
Oh,**** hell!
Why won't this work?

418
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:25,497
Paperboys can work
one of those, mate.

419
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:27,477
Oh, you can steal it,
I don't care.

420
00:23:27,562 --> 00:23:29,777
He's left the key
in it. What a muppet.

421
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:31,842
Oh, God.

422
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:34,556
Come on.

423
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:35,957
Hammond!

424
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:37,937
Hammond!

425
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:40,247
Hammond!

426
00:23:44,442 --> 00:23:46,897
The next morning,
the peaceful stillness

427
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:50,887
was shattered by the cry
of a distressed animal.

428
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:53,879
Clarkson!

429
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:56,385
Clarkson!

430
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,697
Where's my roof?

431
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,314
Right.

432
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:06,752
Bastard!

433
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:12,182
What was that?

434
00:24:12,582 --> 00:24:15,167
What... Oh, you are joking?

435
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,517
No. No.

436
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:18,650
No.

437
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:20,158
He hasn't,
he's not that sick.

438
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:21,519
- Morning.
- What?

439
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:24,310
- Morning.
- Yeah, whatever. Oh!

440
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:27,814
Why have you driven over
your own roof?

441
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:31,174
Clarkson. He's sick.

442
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:36,924
Enjoy your day
on your bicycle!

443
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:38,618
Bastard.

444
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:49,259
Well, I'm cold now,
obviously.

445
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:52,736
Borrowed a jacket
from a cameraman.

446
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:55,408
He's six-three and 18 stone.

447
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:01,486
I'm in a small, stylish,
Italian sports car,

448
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:02,651
supposed to be looking good.

449
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:04,744
I look like
a frostbitten gnome!

450
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,518
Rotten trick, that.

451
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:09,283
I wouldn't stand for it.

452
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:13,338
The only thing that worries me is he
might get some exercise on his bicycle!

453
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:16,283
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Do you think he's already just become

454
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:17,709
one of those
embittered cyclists

455
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:19,789
who hates anybody
who's got a car?

456
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:24,449
Oh, jeez.

457
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,749
What?

458
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,499
Oh, come on!

459
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:32,459
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

460
00:25:35,774 --> 00:25:38,447
He did not mend that.

461
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,859
Very good. Now...

462
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:54,248
I have to say, the only
reason why we met

463
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:56,978
on a beach full of oil rigs
and then drove

464
00:25:57,064 --> 00:25:59,564
through a council estate
full of hypodermic needles

465
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,749
is to annoy...

466
00:26:00,835 --> 00:26:03,870
Well, simply and only to
annoy our Scottish producer.

467
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:06,708
Yes, but we will not tell you
Gav's name, we promise.

468
00:26:06,794 --> 00:26:08,729
No, we won't.
We won't say his name.

469
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:12,595
Anyway, look, it all gets a lot
sunnier and prettier in part two,

470
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,579
when we finally get
on the North Coast 500

471
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,189
and we'll pick that up
later on.

472
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:20,353
Yes, but now
it's time to say hello

473
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:22,964
to the old lady of debate,

474
00:26:23,096 --> 00:26:25,439
who sits
in the bus shelter...

475
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:30,229
of chat on
Conversation Street.

476
00:26:38,094 --> 00:26:39,729
I don't even remember
that one.

477
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:40,728
I don't remember
that happening.

478
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:42,828
Anyway, I wanna stick with
the film in Scotland,

479
00:26:42,914 --> 00:26:45,470
if I may, James May, because
at one point you said

480
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:48,470
you put those plastic things on
the back wheels of your Lancia

481
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:53,814
because it was like putting insulating tape
on the back wheels of a Scalextric car.

482
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,790
- Yeah.
- Who's ever done that?

483
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:57,289
Well, I have.

484
00:26:57,374 --> 00:27:00,949
Yes, but you said it like it's one of
those things that everybody's done.

485
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:02,449
- He did.
- It's like saying,

486
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:05,169
"Oh, remember when you stole
your first pair of tights?"

487
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:07,249
- You know
what it's like, Hammond,

488
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,920
when you've got marmite
on your testicles.

489
00:27:09,006 --> 00:27:11,126
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

490
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,322
Hang on, Scalextric cars have
too much grip. That's the point.

491
00:27:14,408 --> 00:27:16,284
No, they don't! That's why
they end up under the sofa.

492
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,658
- They haven't got any grip.
- Every corner, they fly off!

493
00:27:18,744 --> 00:27:21,915
They've got too much grip, they over-steer
suddenly and you can't control it.

494
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:24,079
If you put the insulating
tape on the rear tyres,

495
00:27:24,165 --> 00:27:26,469
you reduce the grip and then you
can slide them and drift them...

496
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:29,169
Oh, my God,
you have actually done this?

497
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:31,001
Of course
I've bloody done it!

498
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:32,182
Your childhood!

499
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:34,783
Who here has put
insulating tape

500
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:37,108
or any form of tape on the
rear wheels of a Scalextric?

501
00:27:37,194 --> 00:27:39,129
That's nobody at all.

502
00:27:39,214 --> 00:27:40,775
- You?
- There, there.

503
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:44,548
How bored must you be to think,
"I know what I'll do today"?

504
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:47,931
Everyone apart from
that lady over there

505
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:50,400
has never put insulating...

506
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:53,189
It's your worst
explanation ever.

507
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,169
- See me after.
- No, no, it's not. It's not.

508
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:58,931
His worst explanation ever was when
we were doing that water speed record.

509
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:02,134
And he explained to you,
um... to clear things up,

510
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,209
how the boat controls,
which you can operate,

511
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:07,408
on our Pond Bug,
worked the same way

512
00:28:07,494 --> 00:28:10,337
as aeroplane controls,
which you can't operate.

513
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,688
Exactly.
That is the James May way.

514
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,009
Explaining something
you do understand

515
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:16,533
in a way
that you don't understand.

516
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:19,108
Look, hang on a minute. Hold on a minute.
- Actually it was.

517
00:28:19,194 --> 00:28:22,468
You are a man who can't wind a wristwatch
up without taking somebody's eye out.

518
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:24,139
And you claimed in that film

519
00:28:24,225 --> 00:28:26,819
that you'd mended the prop
shaft on that Alfa Romeo.

520
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,160
- I did.
- Did you?

521
00:28:28,245 --> 00:28:30,018
- Well, I made a phone call.
- Did you?

522
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:31,362
Same thing.
And then,

523
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,310
I made a phone call
and a man, unbelievably,

524
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:36,279
drove all the way from
Wiltshire to Inverness

525
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:38,435
with the spare part
that I needed.

526
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:40,553
How generous.
And then you mended it?

527
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:42,320
- Well, I watched.
- Yeah.

528
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:44,880
Actually, this is
the part that broke.

529
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:46,764
You can see the bit
that came out, there,

530
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,104
- yes?
- Mm-hm.

531
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,939
And apparently this is
a known fault on a GTV6.

532
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,201
Everything
is a known fault on...

533
00:28:53,287 --> 00:28:56,440
A GTV6 is a known fault.

534
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,300
- Shall we just move this along?
- Yes.

535
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:01,019
Let's move it along to
more actual conversation.

536
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:02,020
Mm-hmm.

537
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:07,019
Land Rover has announced that 70% of
people suffer from motion sickness.

538
00:29:07,105 --> 00:29:09,386
And they say that in the
future, their cars will have...

539
00:29:09,472 --> 00:29:13,379
some clever system that senses
when you're getting carsick

540
00:29:13,525 --> 00:29:15,260
and then adjusts
the cabin temperature

541
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:17,160
and the suspension to cope.

542
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:20,222
- And I think that's a pretty good idea.
- That is quite clever.

543
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:23,677
I have to say, I've never had any
sort of motion sickness, anyway.

544
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:27,058
But I'm very grateful cos I
once met a man who did have it.

545
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:29,628
It was on a cross-Channel
ferry, very rough crossing.

546
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:31,399
Everybody was being sick
except me.

547
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,886
And I went into the lavs
and there was this bloke

548
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,745
and he was face down
on the floor.

549
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:38,566
On a boat there's a little lip at
the door to stop water getting out.

550
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,127
And that was all
full of sick.

551
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,753
And as the boat rolled, this
little sort of miniature tsunami...

552
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,956
sort of came
and hit him in the face.

553
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:52,753
As I walked in, he looked up
at me and he went, "Kill me."

554
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:55,866
But the thing that was
disturbing is,

555
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:58,073
I know he meant it.
He did mean it.

556
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,487
All right. Anyone had sea sickness?
Cos I have.

557
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:03,428
You do genuinely want
someone to kill you

558
00:30:03,514 --> 00:30:05,379
when you're seasick,
you really do.

559
00:30:05,465 --> 00:30:06,526
You really do.

560
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:08,148
What also troubled me
about that ship was

561
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:10,430
there must've been
500 or 600 people on it.

562
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:12,479
Everybody was
hueying everywhere -

563
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:15,034
horizontal surfaces, vertical
surfaces, the ceiling,

564
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,240
the food, everything.

565
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:18,042
What did they do with it
when it got there?

566
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:20,017
- Scuttle it.
- I think they must've done.

567
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:23,026
Sometimes you've got to, you've
got no choice. Happened to me.

568
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,807
Our childhood car,
a Hillman Avenger,

569
00:30:25,216 --> 00:30:27,491
my little brother vomited
milk in the back of it.

570
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:29,672
- Ugh.
- Scrapped it. It's gone.

571
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:32,613
- It just isn't any good.
- OK, I'll own up to something.

572
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:33,761
Oh, are you sure?

573
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:35,703
I was driving through
Corsica, late for a plane,

574
00:30:35,788 --> 00:30:39,206
and I had my son in the back,
who was probably nine or ten.

575
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:42,067
Going quite quickly. It's all
mountainous roads through Corsica.

576
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:44,228
Very hot day. And he
vommed explosively.

577
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:47,159
And the upholstery was
that kind of textured velour.

578
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:51,362
When we got to the car rental return
place, still late for the plane,

579
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:52,691
the guy's coming over
to check the car.

580
00:30:52,776 --> 00:30:54,712
So I said, "It's all right,
mate, it's all in one piece."

581
00:30:54,797 --> 00:30:56,714
And folded
the back seat down.

582
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,552
- Oh, you did not?
- Yeah, just...

583
00:30:58,637 --> 00:31:00,572
- Oh, you sick man!
- I know.

584
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:02,432
- And left it.
- Yeah. Just left it. Ran.

585
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:04,232
So somewhere there
is a kid who's paid

586
00:31:04,317 --> 00:31:07,132
two euros a day to
clean out returned hire cars.

587
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:09,592
- And he encountered that horror.
- I ruined his life.

588
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:12,792
But the reason we brought up all
this car sickness stuff is the RAC...

589
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:15,807
Always up to speed,
the RAC is.

590
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:18,596
It's put out some advice
saying that um...

591
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:20,992
parents can stop
their children feeling sick

592
00:31:21,077 --> 00:31:23,760
if you can get them
to look at the horizon

593
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:27,675
rather than the screens on
their mobile phones or tablets.

594
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,581
- Good luck with that.
- Is that advice?

595
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,082
"Go on, children,
look at the horizon.

596
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,822
It's more interesting than
Angry Birds or Fortnite."

597
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:36,832
Maybe they can persuade them to tidy their bedrooms afterwards as well.
- Yeah.

598
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:39,510
Yeah. Anyway, that's sick
covered. Let's move it along.

599
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:41,948
I'd like to move it on with
some more conversation.

600
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:45,901
Um, Police in Dubai
are testing a hover-bike.

601
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:48,072
But, no, it actually
is a hover-bike. Here it is.

602
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,112
Look at that.
Look at that thing!

603
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:51,706
Oh, my God.

604
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:53,964
It costs about £117,000.

605
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,025
It can go at 60 miles an hour,
fly for about 25 minutes.

606
00:31:57,397 --> 00:31:59,552
- Look at that.
- Yes, yes.

607
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:03,392
I can see a couple of things, as
a police-pursuit-vehicle problem.

608
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:07,392
If you drove at 61 miles an
hour, you'd get away from it.

609
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:11,152
Actually, you could drive
at less than that,

610
00:32:11,237 --> 00:32:14,612
but for more than 25 minutes
and still get away from it.

611
00:32:14,698 --> 00:32:17,432
Or, and here's another one you
haven't probably considered:

612
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:21,229
if you fell off it, you're falling
through your own propulsion device.

613
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,671
I don't care,
because look at it!

614
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:26,541
I want one of those more
than I want both of my lungs.

615
00:32:26,627 --> 00:32:28,391
It is simply
the best thing I've ever...

616
00:32:28,477 --> 00:32:31,987
James, can you imagine Richard
Hammond on one of those?

617
00:32:33,414 --> 00:32:34,889
Literally minutes of fun.

618
00:32:34,975 --> 00:32:37,995
Yeah, exactly. And then
he would just be a mist.

619
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,768
You'd just be a veneer all
over the nearest building.

620
00:32:40,854 --> 00:32:42,831
You'd actually be able to
walk through Richard Hammond.

621
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:45,431
It would just be a puddle
of Richard Hammond.

622
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,705
All right.

623
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:52,426
- Shit idea.
- Right. Erm...

624
00:32:52,863 --> 00:32:56,898
A lot of people have got it into their
heads that I don't like electric cars.

625
00:32:56,991 --> 00:33:00,080
Well. With good reason, because every
time you've got an electric car,

626
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:04,221
you come back into the office on Monday
morning with another dreary tale of woe.

627
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:06,432
- Cos you can't charge them up!
- Here we go.

628
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,596
You can't! Last weekend,
had a Jaguar I-PACE, OK?

629
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:11,158
This is a really good car.

630
00:33:11,244 --> 00:33:13,377
This is why I have nothing
against electric cars.

631
00:33:13,463 --> 00:33:15,618
That's the new Jag,
and it is fabulous.

632
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:18,119
Lovely to sit in,
quick as hell,

633
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:21,713
better than a Tesla by a long
way, actually, in many, many ways.

634
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:25,908
Brilliant. However, brought it
up here, plugged it into my farm.

635
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:28,432
And boof!
Instant darkness.

636
00:33:29,857 --> 00:33:33,096
This is a farm that can
supply all of Western Europe

637
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:35,603
with vegetable oil
for a thousand years.

638
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:40,057
Plug one Jag into it, and I'm in the
13th century. No electricity at all.

639
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,198
I then took it to a friend's
house, plugged it in there -

640
00:33:42,283 --> 00:33:44,057
he's got more
modern electricity.

641
00:33:44,173 --> 00:33:47,088
Left it overnight and
it had only hoovered up

642
00:33:47,197 --> 00:33:50,533
enough electricity overnight
to cover 29 miles.

643
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:54,334
That's because you're plugging it
into a 14th-century domestic socket.

644
00:33:54,457 --> 00:33:57,012
You're supposed to use a
proper modern fast charger.

645
00:33:57,097 --> 00:33:58,744
- How long would that take?
- 45 minutes.

646
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,127
I haven't got 45 minutes.

647
00:34:00,213 --> 00:34:03,532
I've only got 130,000 hours
left, James, before I die.

648
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:06,893
I'm not going to spend
any of it... What?

649
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:08,010
Wait a minute.

650
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:09,872
This is a new thing of yours
that's started.

651
00:34:09,957 --> 00:34:11,452
"I've only got
130,000 hours."

652
00:34:11,537 --> 00:34:13,072
It's dropping.
It's dropping now.

653
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:15,232
Where does...
It's a lovely thought.

654
00:34:15,543 --> 00:34:17,728
It's dropping...

655
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,363
It is. Get on with it!
I'm losing valuable time!

656
00:34:23,512 --> 00:34:26,332
All right! I do wanna know, though,
where did that number come from?

657
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:28,119
Have you got your phone on you?
-Yes.

658
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:30,681
Cos he always forgets
to leave it behind. OK.

659
00:34:30,774 --> 00:34:32,532
How long? If you don't
have to tell anyone.

660
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:33,493
- How many... how many years
- Yes. Well...

661
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:34,603
do you
think you've got left? Uh...

662
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:37,611
- years I've got left?
- Years, then times that by 365.

663
00:34:37,697 --> 00:34:39,452
- Oh, I see.
- Times it by 24.

664
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:42,916
- How many hours have you got left?
- 394,200.

665
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,275
Right. Well, how much of that
do you want to waste...

666
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:49,010
charging a car, sitting
around while a car charges?

667
00:34:49,096 --> 00:34:51,236
I went on the BBC iPlayer
the other day,

668
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,592
and it said, "You've now
got to register to use this."

669
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,807
No, I haven't! I haven't
got time to do that.

670
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,288
I'll be dead by the time
I've finished.

671
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:00,432
I've got 14,200.

672
00:35:02,776 --> 00:35:04,611
- James!
- What, about hours?

673
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:05,642
Yeah.

674
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,760
That's a week on Tuesday!

675
00:35:08,737 --> 00:35:12,252
May, the whole point
of this exercise...

676
00:35:12,337 --> 00:35:14,452
is you think
of the bloody number!

677
00:35:14,537 --> 00:35:18,908
"It's the rest of my life, I better not
think of a big number, I'll be modest."

678
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:21,072
Well, I'm gonna be pleasantly
surprised, hopefully.

679
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:22,291
- I think...
- Next week.

680
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:24,751
I think we can probably end
Conversation Street there

681
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:27,119
on James May's sad demise.

682
00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:29,197
Any minute now.

683
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,971
I wanna talk about the BMW
M5, which has always been,

684
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:36,432
as I'm sure we all know
in here, the ultimate Q car.

685
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:40,393
It is a fizzing lunatic in
a Geoffrey Chaucer suit.

686
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,412
However, the new M5
has turbo-charging,

687
00:35:43,497 --> 00:35:45,452
so it's kind to polar bears.

688
00:35:45,537 --> 00:35:48,314
And it has four-wheel drive,
so it's safe.

689
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,312
And it has an automatic gearbox,
and that's all very nice.

690
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:53,846
But is it what we want?

691
00:35:55,137 --> 00:35:56,432
Let me, first of all,

692
00:35:56,517 --> 00:36:00,783
explain the basic recipe
for a BMW M5.

693
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:05,932
It's a four-door saloon
with a boot at the back,

694
00:36:06,017 --> 00:36:08,832
space for five businessmen
in the middle

695
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:13,033
and a monstrously powerful
engine at the front.

696
00:36:16,697 --> 00:36:19,580
That's the main thing
about an M5.

697
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:23,385
It must be extremely fast.

698
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:30,283
And this one, they say...

699
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:33,228
is the fastest ever.

700
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:39,211
So I've just pulled up
alongside someone

701
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,952
in his lightweight
running gear

702
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:43,972
and his AMG training shoes.

703
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:46,791
Whereas I am in
a stout pair of Brogues

704
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,692
and some heavy
moleskin trousers.

705
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:53,102
Which means
I'm gonna lose.

706
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:55,705
Or am I?

707
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:06,932
Oh, that hurts!

708
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:10,268
That was 0 to 60
in three seconds.

709
00:37:11,377 --> 00:37:13,619
I can't get my head forward!

710
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:18,143
That's 100 miles an hour
in about seven seconds.

711
00:37:19,374 --> 00:37:21,041
120.

712
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,432
130 miles an hour
as I cross the line.

713
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:31,025
'Tis unbelievable, that.

714
00:37:31,152 --> 00:37:35,682
The cheap, heavy,
four-door saloon

715
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:38,260
just beat the sports car.

716
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:41,893
That's an M5's job.

717
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:47,752
On the face of it, then,
the new version

718
00:37:47,837 --> 00:37:51,650
seems to tick all the
important M5 boxes.

719
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:56,213
It's sensible and
thanks to 592 horsepower,

720
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:58,772
it is Ferrari fast.

721
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:02,632
But what about the turbochargers
and the automatic gearbox?

722
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:05,666
And what about
the all-wheel drive system?

723
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:08,861
Does all that mean
it's no longer capable

724
00:38:08,947 --> 00:38:12,064
of being
a swivel-eyed lunatic?

725
00:38:12,897 --> 00:38:15,314
No. Not really.

726
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:29,127
Yes, because a great deal
of work has been done

727
00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:32,682
to completely eliminate
under-steer...

728
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,325
as you can see.

729
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:37,869
The steering does feel
a bit weird.

730
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:44,697
And yes, because
the engine is turbocharged,

731
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:48,361
the soundtrack
is a bit muted.

732
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:54,916
It's like listening to someone
play the bass... in the next room.

733
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,595
But other than that...

734
00:39:01,537 --> 00:39:05,244
I mean, there must be
turbo lag. There has to be.

735
00:39:05,937 --> 00:39:07,862
But I can't feel it.

736
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:10,892
And the automatic gearbox

737
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:13,650
must change more slowly
than it would

738
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:15,867
if it were
a double-clutch system.

739
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,093
But...

740
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:21,416
Still feels
pretty speedy to me.

741
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:27,377
And even though
all four wheels are driven...

742
00:39:27,939 --> 00:39:30,174
it can still do this.

743
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:37,643
Holy shit!

744
00:39:41,017 --> 00:39:44,412
If you wanted to do this
all the time,

745
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:48,760
you can actually turn off
the four-wheel drive system.

746
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:51,057
Seriously,
you can turn it off!

747
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:53,377
Just have it
in rear-drive only,

748
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:56,010
behave like a complete yobbo.

749
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:07,262
And that's just the start
of the M5's adaptability.

750
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:11,197
You can choose how much
traction control you'd like.

751
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,564
You can choose...

752
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:15,932
how sporty and responsive
you want the engine to be,

753
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:18,096
how uncomfortable
you'd like the ride to be,

754
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,377
how meaty you'd like
the steering to be,

755
00:40:20,463 --> 00:40:22,900
how quickly you want it
to change gear

756
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:25,525
and what you want
on the head-up display.

757
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:28,049
You can even choose
what sort of noise

758
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:29,692
you want the exhaust to make.

759
00:40:29,902 --> 00:40:31,197
Ooh, and look at this one.

760
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:33,666
This menu allows me to choose

761
00:40:33,752 --> 00:40:36,885
what fragrance comes out of
the air-conditioning vents.

762
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:39,096
I can have the Blue Suite,

763
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:42,189
which is a waft
of pure water pearls.

764
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:43,978
Or I can have this one,

765
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:48,213
which gives me a golden
shower of fiery aromas.

766
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,994
And this is all very
Pacific Rim. It's very CGI.

767
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,088
And that's great.

768
00:40:56,617 --> 00:40:58,658
But the truth
of the matter is

769
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:00,832
that the 50-something
businessman

770
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,135
who'll buy this car

771
00:41:02,221 --> 00:41:04,619
will never change
the fragrance setting

772
00:41:04,705 --> 00:41:06,814
or any of the other stuff.

773
00:41:07,817 --> 00:41:11,361
He'll put it in four-wheel
drive comfort mode on day one

774
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:14,721
and leave it there forever.

775
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:17,692
And if he's going to do that,

776
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:20,502
there may be
a better alternative.

777
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:26,197
It's made by a German tuning
company called Alpina.

778
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:31,346
And it's another take on what
a fast BMW should be like.

779
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,432
It costs about
the same as an M5,

780
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:40,252
and has a broadly similar 4.4
litre, twin turbo-charged V8.

781
00:41:40,337 --> 00:41:45,292
It also has four-wheel drive
and an automatic gearbox.

782
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:49,885
However, this car was not
developed at a race track.

783
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:52,697
The boss of Alpina says
if you engineer a car

784
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:53,944
to be good
at the Nurburgring,

785
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:57,161
it won't be any good
on the road.

786
00:41:57,857 --> 00:42:00,986
And he may have a point
on that.

787
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:06,932
So instead of making the front
suspension firm and racy,

788
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:10,385
they tuned it to be able
to deal with potholes.

789
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:13,152
Then they changed
the steering

790
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:16,232
so it would corner
more like an airliner

791
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:19,332
and less like an F-16.

792
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:21,932
Inside,
they gave it blue dials

793
00:42:22,026 --> 00:42:25,041
and a thinner steering wheel
and softer leather.

794
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,852
And look at this.

795
00:42:26,937 --> 00:42:30,518
Something you don't get
in the standard M5.

796
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,471
It's a comfort plus setting,

797
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:36,486
in which the 50-something
businessman

798
00:42:36,572 --> 00:42:40,772
can spend his life
wafting about.

799
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:45,072
But don't think that the
basic fast BMW recipe

800
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:46,912
has been ruined.

801
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:50,484
Because it really hasn't.

802
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:55,072
It actually produces
600 horsepower.

803
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:57,205
That's more than you get
from the M5.

804
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,982
It has more torque too.

805
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,580
And there's no nanny limiter.

806
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:07,072
So this will do
205 miles an hour.

807
00:43:10,177 --> 00:43:12,533
Does this mean, then,
that on a track,

808
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:14,532
the comfort wagon can keep up

809
00:43:14,617 --> 00:43:17,627
with the ultimate
sports saloon?

810
00:43:29,627 --> 00:43:32,269
Well, even though
it was fun finding out...

811
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,650
the answer is no.
Not quite.

812
00:43:41,736 --> 00:43:47,807
The M5 is tauter, more nailed
down, more on it, somehow.

813
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:51,275
So on a track,
make no mistake,

814
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:53,767
the M5 will pull away.

815
00:43:53,853 --> 00:43:56,728
In fact, it is doing.

816
00:43:58,487 --> 00:43:59,822
We're both cats.

817
00:43:59,908 --> 00:44:05,182
It's just that he's a cheetah
and I'm a lion.

818
00:44:07,284 --> 00:44:10,369
If, then, you care about
shaving tenths of a second

819
00:44:10,455 --> 00:44:12,682
off your lap time
at a racetrack...

820
00:44:13,886 --> 00:44:16,211
you're better off
with an M5.

821
00:44:19,377 --> 00:44:23,494
But for going home on the M4
in the real world,

822
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,799
which is what
I'm about to do,

823
00:44:25,912 --> 00:44:28,217
I'd rather use the Alpina.

824
00:44:29,944 --> 00:44:31,629
So I shall.

825
00:44:37,817 --> 00:44:40,512
Very interesting...
interesting observations.

826
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:41,652
Very nice.

827
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,838
So, um...

828
00:44:44,337 --> 00:44:48,080
So after all of that, you
would have the worse car?

829
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:49,642
Well, yes, cos it's better.

830
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,632
- It sounds better to me, I've gotta say.
- Says the voice of speed.

831
00:44:52,717 --> 00:44:57,978
Tell you what, let's find out how
fast the M5 goes round the Eboladrome.

832
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:01,635
And it's off.

833
00:45:01,877 --> 00:45:04,877
She held it against
the brakes for a snappy start

834
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:06,846
and clearly it's worked!

835
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:08,884
Flying onto
the Isn't Straight there.

836
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,225
Ooh, look, it's a bit damp.

837
00:45:11,497 --> 00:45:14,830
Right, having to work
at the fat steering wheel.

838
00:45:14,932 --> 00:45:18,772
Whoomph from the four
exhausts on the up-change.

839
00:45:18,932 --> 00:45:22,705
And now plunging into Your Name
Here looking a little edgy.

840
00:45:22,997 --> 00:45:26,492
But then this is nearly
a two-tonne car.

841
00:45:26,577 --> 00:45:31,192
Heaves forward under braking, but
keeping it all in check in the corner.

842
00:45:31,277 --> 00:45:35,064
And now, back on the power.

843
00:45:35,497 --> 00:45:40,492
Spooling up both turbos
for the fast return run.

844
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:43,963
Looking good. Ooh, dabbing off
a bit of speed at the midpoint.

845
00:45:44,432 --> 00:45:46,830
And ready?
Yep, really hard

846
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:49,838
on the brakes
for Old Lady's House.

847
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,752
This is where understeer
will show itself.

848
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:57,611
But, no, looking tidy.
Not bad for such a heifer.

849
00:45:57,697 --> 00:46:01,212
Taking no prisoners
on the blast to Substation.

850
00:46:01,697 --> 00:46:03,502
Torturing the Pirellis
through there.

851
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:05,720
Just Field of Sheep to go.

852
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:09,556
Tidy through there
and across the line.

853
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,457
It did look quick.

854
00:46:12,543 --> 00:46:15,265
It looks quick but it
looks like it's heavy.

855
00:46:15,492 --> 00:46:16,747
It does look heavy.

856
00:46:17,377 --> 00:46:19,283
Anyway, there's the lap board

857
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:22,283
and we can see the old M5,
look, down there:

858
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:24,972
17th place, one minute 24.2.

859
00:46:25,057 --> 00:46:27,832
Uh, so let's see where
the new one goes.

860
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:29,252
Is it quicker?

861
00:46:29,337 --> 00:46:30,432
- Ooh, it is.
- Yes.

862
00:46:30,517 --> 00:46:33,732
Ooh, my word,
four seconds faster.

863
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:35,322
That's staggering, isn't it?

864
00:46:35,463 --> 00:46:37,372
That's absolutely amazing.

865
00:46:37,457 --> 00:46:41,892
Now, and I have to say, uh, we did, um...
we did time the Alpina,

866
00:46:41,977 --> 00:46:43,752
but we haven't, uh,
we haven't filmed it.

867
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:46,232
- Why not?
- Well, cos it's gonna be slower.

868
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:48,132
It is.

869
00:46:48,217 --> 00:46:50,392
You are gonna look
such an arse if it isn't.

870
00:46:52,297 --> 00:46:54,092
I am, but it won't be.

871
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:56,552
Let's find out.
Let's see where it goes.

872
00:46:56,637 --> 00:46:58,412
This is the Alpina.

873
00:46:58,497 --> 00:47:00,992
There you go. You see?
Slower. As I said.

874
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:02,872
But 1:21.6, not bad. Not bad.

875
00:47:02,957 --> 00:47:06,572
So if you do want
a taut, fast, super saloon,

876
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,092
his advice is get
the flabbier, slower one.

877
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:11,228
- Yeah, it's better.
- This really is some clear

878
00:47:11,314 --> 00:47:13,041
- buying advice again this week.
- It is.

879
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:15,955
Anyway, let's get on to some actual
clear buying advice, uh, shall we?

880
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,832
- Let's get back to our film in Scotland.
- Mm-hm.

881
00:47:18,917 --> 00:47:22,720
Tonight, we are doing, uh, a
tour of the North Coast 500,

882
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,992
around the top of Scotland,

883
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:27,002
in some beautiful
Italian classic cars.

884
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:28,852
And a Fiat X19.

885
00:47:28,937 --> 00:47:31,295
Well, yes, but you two had
both had mechanical issues.

886
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:33,967
- Yes.
- Yeah, we did, but we still had hope in

887
00:47:34,053 --> 00:47:36,748
our hearts that things
would get better.

888
00:47:45,254 --> 00:47:49,352
As we cruised along, our
Italian classics, and the Fiat,

889
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:52,994
continued to provide
unexpected entertainment.

890
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:56,392
I'm gonna show you a
fantastic feature on this car.

891
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:58,302
Here are the heating
and ventilation controls.

892
00:47:58,404 --> 00:48:00,705
I've got it on warm
because it's a cold day.

893
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:04,314
But look what happens when I
press the air-conditioning button.

894
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:06,412
It's haunted!

895
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:07,992
Did you see that?

896
00:48:08,077 --> 00:48:09,259
Look.

897
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,645
Hm, I think
I'll cool myself down.

898
00:48:17,257 --> 00:48:19,552
My head itches
because of this hat.

899
00:48:19,637 --> 00:48:22,314
But if I take it off,
I'll freeze to death.

900
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:27,119
Soon, Hammond insisted
we stop for a cup of tea...

901
00:48:27,236 --> 00:48:30,251
to ward off his hypothermia.

902
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,775
- I've had a thought.
- That's very uncharacteristic of you.

903
00:48:33,861 --> 00:48:34,912
I was gonna say,
first time ever.

904
00:48:34,997 --> 00:48:37,072
No, this is based on
experience and knowledge.

905
00:48:37,267 --> 00:48:40,072
Right, problem with the NC500
going all way round here,

906
00:48:40,157 --> 00:48:41,692
we miss this bit.

907
00:48:41,777 --> 00:48:43,092
We're here, right?

908
00:48:43,177 --> 00:48:44,732
And we miss this road,

909
00:48:44,817 --> 00:48:47,252
which I have driven
and it is breath-taking.

910
00:48:47,337 --> 00:48:50,272
Not just the scenery, which is
incredible, but the actual road itself.

911
00:48:50,357 --> 00:48:52,352
I'm sorry, but if we
just go along here...

912
00:48:52,437 --> 00:48:53,652
Yeah?

913
00:48:53,737 --> 00:48:57,132
We're not exactly
doing the NC500, are we?

914
00:48:57,217 --> 00:49:02,832
No, but what if we create our own
route and claim it for The Grand Tour.

915
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:08,332
We could call that the Scottish
Highlands Intermediate Tour.

916
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:11,552
- How far is it?
- Uh, it's about 287 miles if we do that.

917
00:49:11,637 --> 00:49:15,052
Scottish Highlands
Intermediate Tour 287, 2-8-7.

918
00:49:15,137 --> 00:49:17,552
It would be the sh... No, hang
on, that doesn't work, does it?

919
00:49:17,637 --> 00:49:19,512
Piloting Extremely Nicely
In Scotland.

920
00:49:19,597 --> 00:49:21,292
- 2-8-7.
- Yeah.

921
00:49:21,377 --> 00:49:26,172
So the Piloting Extremely Nicely
In Scotland 2-8-7. That would do.

922
00:49:26,257 --> 00:49:28,622
You see? That's your
second thought of the day.

923
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:32,652
It's cos of the hat.

924
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:35,912
With the new route
sorted out, we set off.

925
00:49:35,997 --> 00:49:40,552
And it turned out that it wasn't
quite like Hammond had said.

926
00:49:40,637 --> 00:49:43,582
It was much, much better.

927
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:52,337
Holy moly.

928
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:58,052
Och aye the view.

929
00:49:58,137 --> 00:50:00,462
It's amaz... Look at it.

930
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,662
I mean, it's...
This is heaven.

931
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:11,552
And not just the scenery,
which is magnificent;

932
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:16,532
the road itself,
the twists, turns, surface.

933
00:50:16,617 --> 00:50:18,312
You have to get the right
ingredients together

934
00:50:18,397 --> 00:50:19,992
in the right order
in the right place.

935
00:50:20,077 --> 00:50:22,292
It's a complicated thing.

936
00:50:22,377 --> 00:50:24,312
A really fabulous road.

937
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:26,702
But this manages it.

938
00:50:28,137 --> 00:50:30,662
Absolutely glorious.

939
00:50:40,867 --> 00:50:47,041
Oh, the PENIS287 is really
coming up trumps here.

940
00:50:56,857 --> 00:51:00,924
God, I bet my car looks elegant
going through this scenery.

941
00:51:11,097 --> 00:51:15,312
This is what the GTV6
was built to do.

942
00:51:15,397 --> 00:51:17,713
Open sweeping roads.

943
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:23,952
Nothing but the sound of
that V6 howling away.

944
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:35,588
Ah.

945
00:51:36,283 --> 00:51:39,845
This is what driving
is all about.

946
00:51:39,947 --> 00:51:41,728
This is the dream.

947
00:51:43,337 --> 00:51:46,372
In fact,
the moment was so magical,

948
00:51:46,457 --> 00:51:52,049
it had taken my mind off something
that had been troubling me all day.

949
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:55,213
Today is the 11th of
April and I don't wanna

950
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:59,104
sound like Eeyore,
but it's my birthday.

951
00:51:59,297 --> 00:52:01,894
And those two
haven't remembered.

952
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:08,312
All of the crew
have said happy birthday.

953
00:52:08,397 --> 00:52:10,632
The director
said happy birthday.

954
00:52:10,717 --> 00:52:13,382
James and Richard?
Nothing.

955
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:19,452
Ullapool, 26 miles.

956
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:24,952
Ullapool, I might be able to get
the prop shaft balanced there.

957
00:52:25,037 --> 00:52:27,629
That's quite a big town.

958
00:52:28,057 --> 00:52:31,632
Guys, how far are
we from the hotel now? Do you know?

959
00:52:31,717 --> 00:52:33,812
About 30 miles, 35.

960
00:52:33,897 --> 00:52:36,597
Well, as it's not late,
I'm gonna dive into Ullapool

961
00:52:36,683 --> 00:52:38,652
and see if I can get
my prop shaft balanced.

962
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:41,152
You're gonna what?
It's vibrating

963
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:42,612
and it will hurt the car,

964
00:52:42,697 --> 00:52:44,712
so I want to just
get it balanced up

965
00:52:44,797 --> 00:52:47,394
and I'll see you
at the hotel later on.

966
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:51,732
That is uncharacteristically conscientious
of Jeremy, to want to go and mend his car.

967
00:52:51,817 --> 00:52:54,112
But it's actually very
convenient for me and Hammond.

968
00:52:54,197 --> 00:52:57,212
We've got something in mind.

969
00:52:57,297 --> 00:53:00,632
The thing is, we hadn't
forgotten it was his birthday.

970
00:53:00,717 --> 00:53:04,112
And with him gone,
we could shoot ahead...

971
00:53:04,197 --> 00:53:07,222
and set up
his surprise party.

972
00:53:08,057 --> 00:53:09,472
Balloons coming in.

973
00:53:09,557 --> 00:53:11,410
Ooh, this is nice.

974
00:53:11,496 --> 00:53:16,051
Right, loosen it off.

975
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:20,312
And that will allow the prop shaft
to settle where it wants to settle.

976
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:24,352
While the short-sighted
orangutan ruined his car,

977
00:53:24,437 --> 00:53:28,212
I was busy in the kitchen.

978
00:53:28,297 --> 00:53:31,431
For Jeremy's birthday
feast, I am preparing

979
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:34,352
his favourite dish,
spaghetti bolognese.

980
00:53:34,437 --> 00:53:40,222
But as it's his birthday and as we are
here, I'm gonna give it a Scottish twist.

981
00:53:50,017 --> 00:53:53,072
Pasta and sauce are ready.
He'd love that.

982
00:53:53,157 --> 00:53:56,792
But now is where I
give it a Scottish twist.

983
00:53:56,877 --> 00:54:00,422
Pop it in, back
for that in a minute.

984
00:54:01,377 --> 00:54:03,792
Now, this should be ready.

985
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:06,412
Oh, yeah.

986
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:08,432
And this is where
it gets Scottish.

987
00:54:08,517 --> 00:54:13,472
Very carefully, you pop it
in the flour like this.

988
00:54:13,557 --> 00:54:15,132
Sprinkle it.

989
00:54:15,217 --> 00:54:18,272
Keeping it together as best you can.
The grilling has helped.

990
00:54:18,357 --> 00:54:20,492
And now into this.

991
00:54:20,577 --> 00:54:23,288
Good coating all over.

992
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:28,812
Drop that as carefully
as I can in there.

993
00:54:28,897 --> 00:54:31,392
Pop it in the oil.

994
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:32,692
Oh, yeah.

995
00:54:32,777 --> 00:54:35,102
Yes, I am doing that.

996
00:54:38,137 --> 00:54:42,616
I'd say... that is ready.

997
00:54:44,817 --> 00:54:46,532
Oh, yeah.

998
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:47,952
That will do nicely.

999
00:54:48,037 --> 00:54:49,872
And there it is.

1000
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:52,546
Spaghetti Mc-Bolognese.

1001
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:57,352
Whilst Richard was battering
and deep-frying everything in sight...

1002
00:54:57,437 --> 00:55:00,412
In you go, my wee beauties.

1003
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,612
I was organising
the guests,

1004
00:55:02,697 --> 00:55:06,632
who were now all here and
waiting for the birthday boy.

1005
00:55:09,177 --> 00:55:11,609
Ooh, ooh, hello, here it is.

1006
00:55:12,077 --> 00:55:13,406
Here it is...

1007
00:55:13,917 --> 00:55:17,372
Oh, Countach,

1008
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:20,212
Lancia 832,

1009
00:55:20,297 --> 00:55:24,782
There's obviously some kind of
classic car meeting going on.

1010
00:55:25,207 --> 00:55:27,532
Oh, wait a minute.

1011
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:31,452
I can't believe it.

1012
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,572
I cannot believe it.

1013
00:55:33,657 --> 00:55:36,292
- You remembered.
- Of course we remembered.

1014
00:55:36,377 --> 00:55:38,712
Actually, it's better than that,
we're having a party for you.

1015
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:41,102
No, but, James...

1016
00:55:45,537 --> 00:55:48,932
There's a classic car meet
going on.

1017
00:55:49,017 --> 00:55:51,292
No, they're your guests.

1018
00:55:51,377 --> 00:55:52,632
For your birthday party.

1019
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:55,292
- It's a 3.2 as well.
- Ohhh.

1020
00:55:55,377 --> 00:55:59,672
You have invited classic car
enthusiasts to my birthday party?

1021
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:02,412
Italian
classic car enthusiasts.

1022
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:04,572
- Who will talk about differentials.
- Yes.

1023
00:56:04,657 --> 00:56:06,929
- Production numbers and chassis numbers.
- Yes, exactly.

1024
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:10,050
I've gotta go and sort out the
music, so I'll see you in a bit.

1025
00:56:10,277 --> 00:56:11,752
- Music?
- Yeah.

1026
00:56:11,837 --> 00:56:14,142
It's a party.

1027
00:56:14,866 --> 00:56:17,432
The finishing touch.

1028
00:56:17,517 --> 00:56:18,812
Garnish.

1029
00:56:18,897 --> 00:56:23,616
Because we eat with our eyes.

1030
00:56:26,017 --> 00:56:29,912
As it turned out, the classic
car enthusiasts were lovely people.

1031
00:56:29,997 --> 00:56:33,472
With some even lovelier cars.

1032
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,332
Look at that.

1033
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:39,012
D'you know,
I've never driven an 832.

1034
00:56:39,097 --> 00:56:42,351
However, talking to them
proved to be quite tricky.

1035
00:56:42,437 --> 00:56:45,430
Were they not on their way to America and
then got here and just thought, this'll...

1036
00:56:45,515 --> 00:56:47,532
do.

1037
00:56:47,617 --> 00:56:50,102
♪ Happy Birthday

1038
00:56:56,297 --> 00:56:59,352
Still, it could be worse.
And then it was.

1039
00:56:59,531 --> 00:57:03,968
Because it was time to sit down
for Richard's Scottish dinner.

1040
00:57:04,237 --> 00:57:09,212
Battered spag bol, followed
by a deep-fried cake.

1041
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:19,752
And then,
to round off the evening...

1042
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:21,532
Oh, no.

1043
00:57:21,617 --> 00:57:24,412
James made
an interesting speech...

1044
00:57:24,497 --> 00:57:26,612
about all the cars I'd owned.

1045
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,672
To your ears as car
enthusiasts, is it not?

1046
00:57:28,952 --> 00:57:33,912
But quite soon, Jeremy moved on
from the VW Scirocco GLi mark 1

1047
00:57:33,997 --> 00:57:37,092
to a VW Scirocco GTi mark 2.

1048
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:38,668
The registration number
of which was...

1049
00:57:38,754 --> 00:57:40,992
Now I've never known whether
you had the manual gearbox

1050
00:57:41,077 --> 00:57:45,132
or the first generation F1
semi-automatic shift. Which was it...

1051
00:57:45,217 --> 00:57:48,072
Very keen for you to know that
it wasn't a CSI, it was a CSL,

1052
00:57:48,157 --> 00:57:49,512
the difference being...

1053
00:57:49,597 --> 00:57:51,492
chromed wheel arch extensions

1054
00:57:51,577 --> 00:57:53,952
and different wheels, was it?
Or something like those stripes.

1055
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:57,012
Alpina wheels
and it had aluminium doors.

1056
00:57:57,097 --> 00:57:58,225
Yes, of course,
it had the lightweight...

1057
00:57:58,311 --> 00:57:59,709
- Bullet in boot lid.
- Yes.

1058
00:58:00,117 --> 00:58:02,592
Ah, but this time
the V8 engine.

1059
00:58:02,677 --> 00:58:05,532
In dark blue,
or was it black?

1060
00:58:05,617 --> 00:58:07,432
Does anybody want to guess?

1061
00:58:10,577 --> 00:58:18,132
traditionalist at heart, as he is
today, drives a VW Golf GTI in grey.

1062
00:58:18,217 --> 00:58:19,912
- You missed the CLK Black.
- Jeremy Clarkson...

1063
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,898
- The what?
- You missed the CLK Black.

1064
00:58:23,697 --> 00:58:26,452
No, it's not on this list.
Which researcher put together

1065
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:28,032
this list of Jeremy's cars
through the ages?

1066
00:58:28,117 --> 00:58:29,712
You didn't even
write the speech?

1067
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,292
Course I didn't.

1068
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:33,960
This is the worst birthday
party I've ever had.

1069
00:58:34,058 --> 00:58:37,063
Come on, we made an effort.
Anyway, shall I get the bagpipes?

1070
00:58:39,737 --> 00:58:44,592
The next morning, we were
up and on the road bright and early.

1071
00:58:44,677 --> 00:58:50,812
This is the first April the 12th since
1972 that I haven't had a hangover.

1072
00:58:50,897 --> 00:58:56,262
Thanks to the world's worst party
organisers, Messieurs May and Hammond.

1073
00:59:01,817 --> 00:59:03,052
Oh, no.

1074
00:59:03,137 --> 00:59:05,462
The vibration is back.

1075
00:59:07,937 --> 00:59:11,902
Ahh, why can't I do anything?

1076
00:59:16,017 --> 00:59:19,732
But despite my problems,
the sun was shining.

1077
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:23,182
And Scotland was
more spectacular than ever.

1078
00:59:42,697 --> 00:59:45,552
Hammond has redeemed himself
with this route.

1079
00:59:45,637 --> 00:59:47,852
He really has.

1080
00:59:47,937 --> 00:59:50,332
- Hammond.
- Hello, yes?

1081
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:53,352
There's no getting around
the fact that your PENIS

1082
00:59:53,437 --> 00:59:57,632
is exactly the right length
and beautiful.

1083
00:59:57,717 --> 00:59:59,532
Well, thank you.

1084
00:59:59,617 --> 01:00:01,692
Would you agree, James May?

1085
01:00:01,777 --> 01:00:05,342
I would, yes. I hate to
have to admit it, but it's spot-on.

1086
01:00:07,977 --> 01:00:12,712
There were now only 50 miles
to go to the finish point on our loop.

1087
01:00:12,797 --> 01:00:16,752
So it felt like a good time
to sum up our wonderful cars.

1088
01:00:16,837 --> 01:00:19,142
And Richard's Fiat.

1089
01:00:20,977 --> 01:00:24,112
Some cars achieve classic
status because they're rare,

1090
01:00:24,197 --> 01:00:26,192
they're thoroughbreds
like those two.

1091
01:00:26,277 --> 01:00:30,232
And with that, you have to accept
they'll be delicate, temperamental.

1092
01:00:30,317 --> 01:00:35,312
Some cars achieve classic status
simply because they're really good.

1093
01:00:35,397 --> 01:00:40,952
The X1/9 was good when it was designed
and built first, and still is today.

1094
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:45,812
Add to that that it cost me
just over £2,000.

1095
01:00:45,897 --> 01:00:48,902
Annoyingly, I've had a bit of
a problem with my headlight.

1096
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:51,272
But then
it's developed a squint.

1097
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:53,662
So it... Oh.

1098
01:00:54,897 --> 01:00:57,432
I think it looks
quite rakish.

1099
01:00:57,517 --> 01:00:59,352
Somehow piratical.

1100
01:00:59,437 --> 01:01:01,622
"Arrr!" Like that.

1101
01:01:03,217 --> 01:01:05,732
Rare,
interesting, beautiful -

1102
01:01:05,817 --> 01:01:08,392
those are the criteria by
which I think you should judge

1103
01:01:08,477 --> 01:01:10,632
whether or not a car
is a true classic.

1104
01:01:10,717 --> 01:01:14,532
It has to be at least two
of those things to qualify.

1105
01:01:14,617 --> 01:01:16,392
So let's have a look
at my Lancia.

1106
01:01:16,477 --> 01:01:19,292
Well,
it's definitely beautiful.

1107
01:01:19,377 --> 01:01:22,432
It's a truly superb
bit of car styling, this.

1108
01:01:22,517 --> 01:01:24,652
And it's rare.

1109
01:01:28,497 --> 01:01:30,832
I had a bit of a root about
online last night

1110
01:01:30,917 --> 01:01:34,455
and there are only two
of these Gamma Coupes

1111
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:37,212
registered and on
the road in Britain.

1112
01:01:37,297 --> 01:01:39,072
And this is one of them.

1113
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:42,982
This is 50%
of the whole thing.

1114
01:01:46,897 --> 01:01:50,462
When we finish these jobs
normally, the cars we've used go...

1115
01:01:51,657 --> 01:01:54,452
Actually, I've no idea
where they go.

1116
01:01:54,537 --> 01:01:56,312
But I know
where this one's going.

1117
01:01:56,397 --> 01:01:58,377
My house.

1118
01:02:00,577 --> 01:02:05,752
Because this car
is just heaven.

1119
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:09,332
Absolute heaven.

1120
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:14,292
Look at it and tell me you
can think of another car

1121
01:02:14,377 --> 01:02:19,902
anywhere on Earth for 10 grand
that you'd like more than this.

1122
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:28,421
Only 11 miles to go now.

1123
01:02:28,509 --> 01:02:30,984
Will James May's engine
explode?

1124
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,327
Apparently sunshine
does cause that.

1125
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:35,092
<i>James May,</i>

1126
01:02:35,177 --> 01:02:36,792
do you think it will explode

1127
01:02:36,877 --> 01:02:39,445
before we get to Inverness
or just afterwards?

1128
01:02:39,897 --> 01:02:43,163
Sooner or later, you will have
to put your peevishness aside

1129
01:02:43,249 --> 01:02:45,421
and admit that I made
the right choice.

1130
01:02:45,523 --> 01:02:47,052
Oh-ho, no, you didn't.

1131
01:02:47,137 --> 01:02:49,476
Anyway, I wouldn't normally say
this, but I want to say

1132
01:02:49,616 --> 01:02:51,952
I'm very proud of you for
mending your prop shaft.

1133
01:02:52,037 --> 01:02:53,352
Well done, mate.

1134
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:54,972
Thanks, yes, yes.

1135
01:02:55,057 --> 01:02:58,342
Is the car much better now
the vibration's gone?

1136
01:02:59,377 --> 01:03:01,152
No.

1137
01:03:01,237 --> 01:03:04,142
- Yes.
- Good.

1138
01:03:05,052 --> 01:03:06,737
He's bluffing.

1139
01:03:11,457 --> 01:03:15,652
Bidding a fond farewell
to Hammond's magnificent PENIS,

1140
01:03:15,737 --> 01:03:18,312
we got back to the town
where we'd started,

1141
01:03:18,397 --> 01:03:20,377
Inverness.

1142
01:03:21,657 --> 01:03:23,702
Mission accomplished.

1143
01:03:29,537 --> 01:03:37,252
Well, there we are. In just three days,
we have covered a staggering 287 miles.

1144
01:03:37,337 --> 01:03:39,892
Well, yours was on
an AA truck for a bit of it.

1145
01:03:39,977 --> 01:03:41,352
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Yeah.

1146
01:03:41,437 --> 01:03:44,692
But apart from one
catastrophic failure

1147
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:48,152
that required somebody to
drive from Swindon in Wiltshire

1148
01:03:48,237 --> 01:03:50,852
all the way to Inverness
with a spare part...

1149
01:03:50,937 --> 01:03:53,047
Don't forget that my windscreen
wiper fell off as well.

1150
01:03:53,132 --> 01:03:54,555
Yeah, and one of
my headlamps is stuck.

1151
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,249
Yeah, but apart from
those things,

1152
01:03:56,335 --> 01:03:59,343
we have proved
that it is still possible

1153
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:03,252
to buy and enjoy
a classic car

1154
01:04:03,337 --> 01:04:05,452
even if you're quite poor.

1155
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:06,972
Yeah, we should be
proud of that.

1156
01:04:07,057 --> 01:04:08,592
- Yeah, we should.
- Yeah.

1157
01:04:08,677 --> 01:04:10,872
With that,
back to the studio. Tent.

1158
01:04:10,957 --> 01:04:12,372
- Tent.
- Tent.

1159
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:14,422
- Cos we're quite poor.
- Yes.

1160
01:04:17,537 --> 01:04:20,332
- Great trip.
- Yeah.

1161
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:22,232
- It's, um...
- Yeah, it was good.

1162
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,772
- What a trip.
- It's funny, isn't it?

1163
01:04:24,857 --> 01:04:27,796
It's funny, over the years we
have travelled the whole world

1164
01:04:27,882 --> 01:04:29,757
- looking for the best driving roads.
- Yeah.

1165
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:32,152
And it turns out, it was just
next door all along.

1166
01:04:32,237 --> 01:04:36,352
I have to say, I don't want to say
this in front of our Scottish producer.

1167
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:38,052
Do not name Gavin Whitehead.

1168
01:04:38,137 --> 01:04:39,352
No, I...

1169
01:04:39,437 --> 01:04:42,732
I shan't, but
that was just about

1170
01:04:42,817 --> 01:04:44,343
the best drive I've ever had.

1171
01:04:44,429 --> 01:04:47,372
That road, that scenery,
that Alfa.

1172
01:04:47,457 --> 01:04:49,457
- That party. OK.
- No, not the party.

1173
01:04:49,543 --> 01:04:53,051
Everything else was...
Well, it was perfection.

1174
01:04:53,137 --> 01:04:55,074
I do agree with you,
I thought it was spectacular,

1175
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,792
but we should get back to
the point of this film,

1176
01:04:56,877 --> 01:05:01,025
which is that you can buy
an affordable classic car

1177
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:03,332
that is also an investment.

1178
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:06,142
Are you sure you wanna raise
this particular point, James?

1179
01:05:06,228 --> 01:05:08,032
Why don't you tell the
ladies and gentlemen

1180
01:05:08,118 --> 01:05:09,360
how it worked out
with your Lancia?

1181
01:05:09,446 --> 01:05:12,332
Well, OK, I spent 13 and a
half thousand pounds on the car

1182
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:15,165
and when I got it home I discovered
the price of putting it right

1183
01:05:15,251 --> 01:05:17,442
was only £6,000.

1184
01:05:17,657 --> 01:05:20,931
So, you're investment
has gone down by 45%.

1185
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:23,470
- Correct, yes.
- Mm, now my Alfa, as I said in the film,

1186
01:05:23,556 --> 01:05:25,091
I have brought it home
with me.

1187
01:05:25,397 --> 01:05:27,812
And since we made that,

1188
01:05:27,897 --> 01:05:30,672
which was April, so six
months, nine months ago,

1189
01:05:30,757 --> 01:05:33,652
uh, it's only cost £8,000.

1190
01:05:33,908 --> 01:05:35,123
In repairs.

1191
01:05:35,314 --> 01:05:37,472
So, your investment
has gone down by 80%.

1192
01:05:37,557 --> 01:05:39,972
- Yes, what about you?
- 100%.

1193
01:05:40,057 --> 01:05:41,172
Really?

1194
01:05:41,257 --> 01:05:42,872
Yeah, day after
we finished filming,

1195
01:05:42,957 --> 01:05:45,112
the engine blew,
car in the bin, all gone.

1196
01:05:46,737 --> 01:05:48,783
So, to conclude, then, s...

1197
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:52,119
All of us have lost some money
and one of us has lost all of it.

1198
01:05:52,205 --> 01:05:53,172
- Yes, exactly.
- Yes.

1199
01:05:53,257 --> 01:05:54,952
And on that terrible
disappointment,

1200
01:05:55,037 --> 01:05:56,252
it is time to end.

1201
01:05:56,337 --> 01:05:58,552
I'm going home now
in my Alfa Romeo.

1202
01:05:58,637 --> 01:06:00,492
No, you're not.

1203
01:06:00,577 --> 01:06:02,552
- I only live over there.
- Yeah, we know.

1204
01:06:02,637 --> 01:06:04,332
Exactly, too far.

1205
01:06:04,417 --> 01:06:07,329
Whatever. Thanks for watching,
take care, see you next time. Bye.

1206
