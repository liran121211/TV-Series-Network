2
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:57,960
Thank you so much,
thank you.

3
00:00:58,138 --> 00:00:59,733
Hello and welcome.

4
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:01,756
Thank you.

5
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:02,887
Thank you.

6
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:04,452
Hello and welcome

7
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:07,741
to what is
a Grand Tour special.

8
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:09,709
Yep, and it's gonna
be a big one,

9
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,897
because we've had
a request from Amazon.

10
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:14,851
You know how if you're watching
a programme and you pause it,

11
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:17,795
you get to see a selection of
beautiful landscape photographs

12
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,272
from all around the world?

13
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,272
Yeah, well, we've been asked
to come up with

14
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:24,172
some new photographs
of wild animals.

15
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:26,319
Yeah, us three,
wildlife photographers.

16
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:28,842
What could possibly go wrong with that?

17
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:30,686
It's such an obvious idea,

18
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:33,139
I don't know why we
never thought of it before.

19
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:35,194
But, anyway, we decided
that obviously

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,381
we'd need the right gear
and the right cars,

21
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:39,928
and then we should meet up
with all of that

22
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:44,616
in the most ecologically
diverse country on Earth...

23
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,436
Colombia.

24
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,629
Colombia is
nature's treasure chest.

25
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:05,531
Its endless soaring peaks,
vast forests,

26
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,574
lazy rivers
and babbling brooks

27
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,052
are home to a greater
variety of birds and animals

28
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:15,551
than you'll find
anywhere else on Earth.

29
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:23,092
Of course, common sense dictated
that to get our pictures,

30
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:26,910
we should meet far from
the stain of humanity.

31
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:33,852
But for some
extraordinary reason,

32
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,418
Richard Hammond decided
that the start point

33
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:38,582
should be in the middle
of the night...

34
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:42,465
close to the bustling city
of Cartagena...

35
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:45,223
on a tropical beach.

36
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:01,937
- Morning.
- Morning.

37
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:04,812
Why did he say
meet on a beach

38
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:07,612
and why... actually,
why did we listen to him?

39
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:11,098
Where is he? Hammond?

40
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:14,145
It's four o'clock,
for Pete's sake.

41
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,801
- Uh, is that a Fiat Panda?
- Fiat Panda 4x4!

42
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:20,184
- It's terrible.
- It's fantastic.

43
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:22,270
No, that's fantastic.

44
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:25,731
Look at that.
That is a sturdy car, that is.

45
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,559
Isn't that a very popular
car with the gay community?

46
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:30,701
- Is it?
- There was a thing in America

47
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:34,371
where they had the top ten...
top ten LGBT cars.

48
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:37,132
And that came third
or something.

49
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,575
What, Lesbian,
Bacon... No, what is it?

50
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,576
- Lesbian, Bacon, Transgender...
- Lesbian...

51
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,746
What's that?
Well, that was a...

52
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:49,223
that was not a distress flare?

53
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:51,903
Well, a red one
is a distress, isn't it?

54
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:54,976
- What's that?
- Hang on, is that...?

55
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:57,379
Is there a person on t...?
There's somebody on it.

56
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:59,731
Hello? Hello!

57
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:02,016
- Hello!
- It's Hammond.

58
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:04,256
- That is Hammond.
- Hammond!

59
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,056
- Hammond!
- Hello! Here I am!

60
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:08,336
- Is that you?
- Are you OK?

61
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,936
Yes.
Some help would be good!

62
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:12,816
Is that your car?

63
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:16,621
- Yes. This is my car!
- It's his car.

64
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,216
As the sun began to rise,

65
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,056
we asked Hammond
to come ashore

66
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:26,137
so we could work out
what on Earth was going on.

67
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:29,348
Quite a lot
of explaining here.

68
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:32,332
- A lot of unpacking.
- Morning.

69
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:33,456
Yeah, good morning.

70
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,096
Well, where do we begin?
Why is your car out there?

71
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:39,096
Well, because that's where
the boat dropped me off.

72
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:41,616
- What boat?
- Well, I shipped it from North America.

73
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:42,817
- Yeah.
- They got to here,

74
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:43,926
wrapped it in polythene,

75
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:45,904
lobbed it over the side, me with it.
That's how they do it.

76
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:50,387
I think, I reckon, there's a
lot of trade between the two.

77
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,376
There's bound to be,
isn't there?

78
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:52,856
What,
so you're saying, what,

79
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:54,168
that Colombia's exporting

80
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:55,871
- something to America?
- Yes, exactly.

81
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,122
- I think there's more... Precisely.
- And then the ships are coming back empty?

82
00:04:58,207 --> 00:04:59,419
I think there's
more of whatever it is

83
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:01,762
going to North America,
so they go out full.

84
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:04,296
Then they come back so you
can get a much cheaper ride.

85
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:06,736
- Cost peanuts.
- Hold that.

86
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:08,848
What are they shipping?

87
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,357
Well, what does
Colombia produce?

88
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:14,621
I've got it here. The main
agricultural products of Colombia

89
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:18,270
are coffee, cut flowers,
bananas, rice, tobacco,

90
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:20,856
forest products - whatever
they are - and shrimp.

91
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,457
I bet it's shrimp.

92
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:24,096
Yeah, but we were
wondering why they don't

93
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:25,976
drop you off,
for example, in a port.

94
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:27,832
I know.
They just, they don't use it.

95
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,199
That's how they... It all seemed
perfectly normal to them.

96
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:31,997
Wrap it in polythene,
throw it over the side.

97
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,021
- And threw you over the side as well.
- Yeah. Yeah.

98
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:35,896
What's it say on that?
Global Auto...?

99
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,136
Yeah, GAK.
Global Auto Kings.

100
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:41,114
They're... That's what
they said was the company.

101
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,456
Problem we've got is...

102
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,681
how are you gonna get
your car from there... to here?

103
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:47,510
I was rather hoping
that'd be we'd do that.

104
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:49,336
No, no,
if you listen carefully,

105
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:52,291
he said how you're going to get
your car from there to here.

106
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,616
"You" singular.
Just you, meaning you.

107
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,416
- W...
- No, he didn't say "us".

108
00:05:56,502 --> 00:05:58,577
You made us get up
at four o'clock...

109
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,056
Eventually, though,
James relented

110
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:04,010
and agreed to pull
Hammond's car ashore.

111
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,256
Right, go, May. Go, go, go!
Give it a yank.

112
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:15,576
James, what is that?
I mean...

113
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:18,228
It's got 49 horsepower. It's
gonna ruin it. Get the Jeep.

114
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:21,016
Can we find a small dog
instead to tow it?

115
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:22,696
- Get the Jeep.
- Get the what?

116
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:24,816
- This...
- What have you got?

117
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,650
A Jeep. It's there.

118
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,056
Well, bring that over!

119
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,815
When I returned
in the LGB Jeep,

120
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,470
Hammond thanked me -
by taking the mickey.

121
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:38,736
That's very nice, by the way.

122
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:41,541
- Well done. I'm proud of you.
- Isn't it? Why are you proud of me?

123
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:44,176
You've done well. That is a hard
thing to do and you've done it.

124
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:45,976
You are gonna be
so much happier.

125
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:49,556
Would you like me
to help you get your car...

126
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,220
- I would, I would.
- Out of the sea?

127
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:52,536
- Shut up, then.
- OK.

128
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,994
I thought you might be nicer
now it's all out in the open.

129
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,220
We hitched up the rope

130
00:06:57,306 --> 00:07:01,341
and then waited for the
right wave to help us along.

131
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,661
Go... now.

132
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,935
Yes!

133
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,656
No, not at all good. Whoa!

134
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:15,619
I then realised that
we were doing this all wrong.

135
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:18,642
That is presumably
a pick-up truck.

136
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:19,976
- Yes?
- Yes, you've guessed.

137
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:21,696
- And four-wheel drive. Yes. Right.
- Yes?

138
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:25,256
Why don't you go out there,
cut away the polythene bag,

139
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,016
and drive it out
using the engine?

140
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,900
It's a good idea. Cos what you
don't do when you drive a car

141
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:32,536
is use the engine
in someone else's car.

142
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:34,963
- You use the one in your own car.
- Yes.

143
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,916
So, while Hammond
unwrapped his car...

144
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:43,291
James and I turned our
attention to his Fiat Panda.

145
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:45,576
I bought it from
an English family

146
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:47,736
who had bought
a house in Tuscany.

147
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,336
And this... Pepe.

148
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,536
Pepe the Panda.

149
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,576
- And they loved it.
- Do you kn...

150
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:57,187
I know everything
about this family.

151
00:07:57,359 --> 00:08:00,452
This has been used for picking their
friends up from Pisa airport.

152
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:01,736
Oh, undoubtedly.

153
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,076
And their friends are...
the editor of the Guardian...

154
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:05,685
- Yes.
- Tony Blair...

155
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,677
- Cherie Blair.
- Sting.

156
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:11,279
- Alan Yentob.
- Yes.

157
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:14,404
Every single
lightweight socialist

158
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,055
in Britain
has been in this car.

159
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:19,776
I bet they made their own olive oil as well.

160
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:21,696
Oh, they were socialists,
really.

161
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,616
As they are sitting with their
Prosecco and really care.

162
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,616
"We're raising awareness."
"Raising awareness" means,

163
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:28,724
"I'm doing
absolutely nothing at all."

164
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,536
I'll bet they had a little
man in the village...

165
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:32,787
As the Pet Shop Boy
ranted on,

166
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:36,636
Hammond finally finished
unwrapping his pick-up truck.

167
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:40,176
Unfortunately, though...

168
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:41,911
it wouldn't start.

169
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:47,099
No.

170
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,456
So, after getting brained
by the waves for a while,

171
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,576
he waded ashore again and came
up with a hare-brained scheme

172
00:08:56,662 --> 00:09:01,450
where the Fiat would be an
anchor and the Jeep a tug.

173
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:05,060
Right, parking brake is off
and I am in neutral.

174
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:08,379
- Right. You're ready.
- <i>Uh... good, I am as well.</i>

175
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,136
<i>I'm taking up the slack.</i>

176
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:15,021
- Here we go.
- That's looking good.

177
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:18,496
No, no.

178
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:21,616
Clarkson, you're pulling me
into the sea! Clarkson!

179
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:24,702
Stop! Stop!

180
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,091
Why are you there?

181
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:29,692
You've pulled me in the sea,
you muppet!

182
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:33,096
Oh, shit...

183
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,456
Thanks to
Hammond's stupid idea,

184
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,016
the cameras in my car
were completely ruined.

185
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:44,685
So we ordered a taxi, sent him into
town to get a proper tow truck...

186
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:48,376
and when he returned, he
asked Jeremy of all people

187
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:50,419
to operate its winch.

188
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:53,616
Are you moving?

189
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:55,736
Yes! Yes, I am!

190
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:58,056
You see, you mock people
who like winching and stuff,

191
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:59,701
but don't tell me
you're not enjoying this.

192
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:02,645
It is incredible how much
power you can get

193
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:05,616
out of a little tiny electric
winch. When you think...

194
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:07,356
Is he having some sort of
winch fantasy?

195
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:08,981
I've turned him off.

196
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:12,616
I'm just sitting here making
sure that LED doesn't go red,

197
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,616
in which case the winch
is overheating.

198
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,056
Which he seems to think
is incredibly exciting.

199
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:20,696
Jeremy? You need to stop, you're gonna
pull me into the... the shelter.

200
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:24,896
The only thing is... though
we have done well, actually,

201
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:26,816
is these three cars
we've got.

202
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:30,184
Because... they're all
designed to go off road

203
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,965
and yet they couldn't be
more different.

204
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:34,903
Jeremy, you're pulling me
through the building!

205
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:38,856
That is true, it is,
it's a good trio of cars.

206
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:40,549
W... No!

207
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,696
You've got mine, which is
bought by people who like

208
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:44,949
cruising the streets of
San Francisco, Key West,

209
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,616
Brighton and Sydney.

210
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,816
And then yours,
which is bought by people...

211
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:51,457
- Jeremy! Stop!
- who wanna feel better about themselves.

212
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:53,295
Yeah. So if you have
your second home

213
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:55,216
whilst people in the world
are homeless and starving,

214
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:57,740
it's OK as long as you
have a small Fiat. -

215
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:00,896
Oh, shit.
Hammond, you moron!

216
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:03,123
Well, I couldn't do anything!
I've got no steering.

217
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,638
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I was yelling on the radio!

218
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:07,224
You pulled me
through a building.

219
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,816
This family has loved
this car since 1991

220
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,974
and you turn up from bloody
Wales or North America,

221
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,365
or wherever it is
you've been,

222
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:14,467
and you've already
ruined it.

223
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:17,136
Listen, it's been
a bit of a cluster thing.

224
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:18,416
We need to work it all out.

225
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:20,696
We need communications
properly organised.

226
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,576
- What is that? That.
- You need a...

227
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,416
It's my ladder. Ah.

228
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:27,856
You've bought something you can't get
into or out of without a ladder?

229
00:11:28,058 --> 00:11:29,677
Well, it's very high up.

230
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:33,201
Hammond, that's the worst
thing I've ever seen.

231
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,513
It's brilliant.
Look at it.

232
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:36,776
That was like the best
Christmas I've ever had,

233
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:38,388
unwrapping it out at sea.

234
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,279
"Ooh-hoo, can't wait!"... so.

235
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,136
And then I saw
a little bit of a flame. Ah!

236
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:45,496
And what is that? A
skull-faced fox abomination?

237
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,336
- Look at it.
- That is inspiration.

238
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:49,136
It's already got
nature pictures on it.

239
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:51,736
It's brilliant. Doesn't that
cheer you up a bit?

240
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:53,536
- No, it doesn't cheer me up.
- Yes, it does.

241
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:55,056
It makes you feel happy.

242
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,435
So far,
Hammond's pick-up

243
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:59,029
had wrecked everything
on the beach

244
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:00,656
and all my cameras

245
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:02,816
and cost us ten hours.

246
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:05,218
So we told him
to shut up - again -

247
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:06,701
and get it working.

248
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:10,616
And once he'd done that...

249
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,259
Yeah!

250
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,732
We headed into Cartagena
to buy some cameras.

251
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:22,861
<i>SONG IN SPANISH...</i>

252
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:35,263
Right, this Jeep Wrangler
Hard-tail cost £8,000

253
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:38,896
and absolutely everything
on it works.

254
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:42,856
And... with my
Hercule Poirot hat on,

255
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:45,982
I would say that this car
was originally sold in Japan,

256
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:49,005
because the television, CD,
satnav system here

257
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:52,630
is all in Japanese,
which means I can't work it.

258
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:55,096
And then you've got little
stickers all over everywhere.

259
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:59,615
This one says - look, "Hysteric
Glamour" and "CDC Rockers".

260
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,521
That's a very Japanese-y
thing to do.

261
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,035
So, this was built in Ohio,
shipped to... Japan,

262
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:10,496
exported to England, and then
I've shipped it to Colombia.

263
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,856
This, then, has done
120,000 miles on the road

264
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:17,576
but about twice that
on ships.

265
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:22,016
I think it's gonna be
ideal, though,

266
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,536
for wildlife photography,

267
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:27,091
because it's four-wheel
drive, it's a Jeep.

268
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,936
So I could use it
to track a snow leopard.

269
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:31,795
It's got a 4-litre
straight 6,

270
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:34,404
so I could keep up
with a diving eagle.

271
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:36,736
And, of course, no roof,
fold-down windscreen,

272
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:41,795
so a 360-degree field of fire
for my camera.

273
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:55,935
Let me fill you in a bit
on my 1998 Chevy C/K Silverado.

274
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:58,016
It's a full-size
American pick-up

275
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:00,443
that's been made a bit bigger
with a lift kit

276
00:14:00,545 --> 00:14:02,639
and modifications that
I'll tell you about later.

277
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:08,271
Most importantly, it's got a proper
big, old 7.4-litre V8 up front

278
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:09,776
in a very lazy
state of tune,

279
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:12,607
just churning out
huge gobbets of grunt.

280
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:16,513
I have four-wheel drive -
high and low ratios.

281
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:20,248
That and this massive
lift kit, I can go anywhere.

282
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,177
Probably most wildlife photographers
use things like this, anyway.

283
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,136
You don't see it, you know, on the
telly with Attenborough and stuff,

284
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:28,696
cos, well, this is
behind the scenes.

285
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:30,365
This is how they get there.

286
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,775
<i>SONG IN SPANISH...</i>

287
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,816
Now we're alone, viewers, let me
tell you a little bit about my car.

288
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:42,748
I know some of you are thinking,
"Oh, that's just a Fiat Panda,"

289
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,341
and "They're in South
America."

290
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,296
They're bound to be going
over difficult terrain."

291
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:48,357
Yes, yes, yes.
But let me tell you this.

292
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,896
What you need
for serious off-roading

293
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:52,776
is smallness and lightness.

294
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:55,045
That's what I've got.
This is a tiny car.

295
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:57,896
It weighs 780 kilograms.

296
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:02,616
A quarter of what Hammond's
stupid monster truck weighs.

297
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,696
It has a four-wheel drive
system made in Austria,

298
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,256
very dependable.

299
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,005
Does have
inclinometers on it,

300
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:11,193
so that I can see
when I'm about to fall over.

301
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,216
And it's perfect.
It all works.

302
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:16,716
The fan, the cooling system,
all the instruments.

303
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:18,344
It's all perfect.

304
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:21,164
But then...

305
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,456
My indicators have just
packed up so, you know,

306
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,091
there will be no indications.

307
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:28,636
Problems with
Italian electrics?

308
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:31,240
I know, it's unheard of.

309
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:35,013
The lift kit added to this
car by the previous owner

310
00:15:35,107 --> 00:15:40,279
has not improved the
steering or handling or ride.

311
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,376
What's it like being tall?

312
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,736
Bless him,
he's all exuberant.

313
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:50,861
Finally, he can be himself,
and good for him.

314
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:55,263
Soon we arrived at
the really rather beautiful

315
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,896
walled city of Cartagena.

316
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,232
Which was bad news for the
not-at-all beautiful Trump truck.

317
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:05,013
Oh, wait a minute.

318
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:08,662
Oh, hang on.

319
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:14,363
Are these walls important and,
like, really old and precious?

320
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,376
17th century, Hammond.

321
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:19,576
That's how old they are.
It's a World Heritage Site.

322
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:21,616
A World Heritage Site.

323
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:25,136
Well, if they're that old,
the odd chip won't matter, will it?

324
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,189
What a moron.

325
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,720
Oh, my God.

326
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:38,617
If I lived in
a walled World Heritage Site,

327
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:41,896
I wouldn't be pleased
to see that coming in.

328
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:44,976
Right.

329
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:47,136
Oh, God.

330
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:48,776
This is tight.

331
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:50,581
There's an ambulance.

332
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:53,336
That's an actual ambulance.

333
00:16:58,261 --> 00:16:59,776
Oh, shit.

334
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:03,216
Shit, that ambulance is coming
down here, Hammond. Boot it!

335
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:05,736
Hammond, there's an ambulance.
You've gotta get out the way.

336
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:07,296
Well, I can't.

337
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:09,936
Oh, God.

338
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,816
Jesus, come on.

339
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:13,736
Oh, I feel bad.

340
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:15,936
Come on,
Hammond, boot it.

341
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:18,661
You're just gonna have to go.
Run over everything.

342
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:21,416
Situation report.

343
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:25,176
Hammond has caused a ten-hour
delay to our schedule

344
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:27,176
and is now killing a man.

345
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,616
Ooh, shit, sorry.

346
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,208
Oh, that was bad.

347
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:40,416
After I'd paid
for the bruised fruit...

348
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:43,557
Here. I do apologise.

349
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:47,416
We plunged into the
labyrinth of narrow streets

350
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:49,658
to find a camera shop.

351
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:53,176
That was easy for the Jeep
and the Panda.

352
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:54,416
However...

353
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:08,141
Yeah, one more go.
I can do this.

354
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:15,656
Yeah, I'm... I'm...
I'll sort it in a minute.

355
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,880
I'll be out of the way
in a second.

356
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:22,136
I don't why
Hammond and May think

357
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:25,473
that the Wrangler's
a... a gay icon.

358
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:31,656
Eventually,
having got our shopping done,

359
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:34,785
we met up
for a camera show-and-tell.

360
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,629
And, once again, Hammond had
gone completely over the top.

361
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:45,957
What have you bought?

362
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:47,536
Everything.

363
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:49,616
If I know anything about
wildlife photographers,

364
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:51,576
you need the kit.
So this goes around my waist.

365
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:55,536
In here I have a selection
of prime lenses.

366
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:59,776
A real... That's a macro lens for taking
close-up stuff, like, really close.

367
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:02,616
This is a 50 mil prime,
really fast, beautiful lens.

368
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:05,056
Uh... then I've got
another harness.

369
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:06,736
So that's for
the actual camera.

370
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:09,416
I have filters for the flash guns.
There's two flash guns.

371
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:10,849
They can trip
one another off as well.

372
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,754
- So you pull up... Stop.
- What?

373
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,481
- You pull up by a-a-an animal.
- Yeah?

374
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,715
- You need a photograph of it.
- Oh, yeah.

375
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:19,656
An animal is gonna run off any minute.
You need to be quick.

376
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,416
However big or small
that animal is,

377
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:23,576
I will have the lens for it,
flash for it...

378
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:26,176
Yes, but you'll have to hope it's
dead or it'll simply run off.

379
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:29,856
And then, importantly,
of course, camera body.

380
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,376
- Very good one.
- Well remembered.

381
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,656
And most importantly of all,
telephoto lens.

382
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,376
Shall I show you
what I've got?

383
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,256
- Yes.
- I haven't bothered with any of that.

384
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,536
I've just gone for
the telephoto -

385
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:42,356
not one of yours - but that.

386
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:44,816
This is all I've got.
That's all you need.

387
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,896
- What, that is literally it?
- Yeah. That's all you need.

388
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:51,426
Well, are you gonna photograph
animals in this country?

389
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:53,656
- I...
- That's a pervert camera.

390
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,754
No, it's a Daily Mail camera
is what it is.

391
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,715
Exactly. That's what I meant.

392
00:19:57,981 --> 00:20:00,059
- Oh. That's heavy.
- I'll bet it is!

393
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:02,056
- That's a lot of glass.
- Clear this away.

394
00:20:02,141 --> 00:20:04,341
Let me show you
what I've got.

395
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:10,416
All right.

396
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:18,656
That is a camera.

397
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:22,296
If we'd been tasked with photographing
somebody's 21st birthday party...

398
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:24,616
- Perfect.
- Welcome to 2018.

399
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,277
Everything you've got
in all that kit

400
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:28,376
that you've just shown us,
is in there.

401
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,942
Show me your zoom lens.

402
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,187
- Behold the lens.
- What, is it a cold day?

403
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:34,535
Behold the zoom.

404
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:37,434
The woman in the shop said this
camera takes good pictures.

405
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:40,934
That's enough for me.

406
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,168
Keen to get cracking,
we hit the streets

407
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:47,106
and began immediately
to do animal photography.

408
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,056
James, move,
you're in my shot.

409
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:52,567
Woof... Grrr...

410
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:54,981
Shit.

411
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,816
I've gotta get further away.

412
00:20:57,098 --> 00:21:00,106
Oh, wait, I thought I saw
an insect, but I've...

413
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,261
Green flash.

414
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:14,776
Oh, Christ,
I've got a macro on!

415
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:17,981
Stay, pigeon. Don't scare it.

416
00:21:19,101 --> 00:21:20,741
Er...

417
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:24,093
Oh!

418
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,615
- Get out of the way.
- I'm sorry. Am I annoying you?

419
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:29,136
Yes, you are. You can't
possibly need to be that close.

420
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,896
Hello, horsey.

421
00:21:30,981 --> 00:21:33,536
Eventually,
we got into the groove.

422
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:36,296
Got it.

423
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,296
Look. Look at my pigeon.

424
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:40,376
And after just 20 minutes...

425
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:46,715
we met up to celebrate
a job well done.

426
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:48,936
- Yeah, I've got a dog.
- You've got that horse one.

427
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:50,616
I've got a pigeon
looking gormless.

428
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:52,496
I think we... Haven't we
pretty much done it?

429
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:54,936
A number of dogs
and a number of horses.

430
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:57,936
And a spider's ho...
The spider had gone,

431
00:21:58,021 --> 00:22:00,056
but I've got the hole the spider...
That's habitat.

432
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,736
You've got where
the spider lived.

433
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,776
- That's habitat.
- Oh, hang on, sorry.

434
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:05,376
That's what they want.

435
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:07,736
Chaps, we have a message here
from Mr Wilman.

436
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:09,856
- What?
- What does he want?

437
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,576
It's bad news, I'm afraid.

438
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:15,296
Amazon don't just want pictures
of pigeons, dogs, and flies.

439
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,855
They want
interesting stuff as well.

440
00:22:18,661 --> 00:22:21,536
They insist the following
must be included:

441
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:24,896
a condor, a spectacled bear,

442
00:22:24,981 --> 00:22:27,936
a jaguar
and a hippopotamus.

443
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:31,074
And they must be wild.
You can't just go to a zoo.

444
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,576
Hippopotamus?
You don't get those here.

445
00:22:33,661 --> 00:22:35,705
- They don't have them here, do they?
- In Africa.

446
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,386
Well, how are we
gonna do that, then?

447
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:39,216
How in the hell
are we gonna get a picture

448
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:40,816
of a hippopotamus
in South America?

449
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,376
You've got
a really long lens!

450
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,889
But I'll have to be on a very
tall mountain to see Africa.

451
00:22:44,975 --> 00:22:48,373
Well, I tell you what we're not
going to see lumbering by here...

452
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:55,607
The next day, armed with our
new and more challenging instructions,

453
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:58,670
we decided to make
an early start.

454
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:00,521
Sadly, however...

455
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:07,176
What was that?

456
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,545
It's... The starter keeps engaging
whilst the engine is running. Hang on.

457
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:14,176
- Only does
it occasionally. It's incon...

458
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:15,576
Ah!

459
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,736
- It's that.
- Ohh.

460
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,330
It's better. It's mended.
All is fine.

461
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,536
I'd like to name my Fiat...

462
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:36,021
See, that's a terrible noise.
Ohh!

463
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:43,776
Leaving Hammond to repair
the endlessly annoying Trump truck,

464
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:46,176
May and I hit the road.

465
00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:49,021
<i>POP SONG IN SPANISH...</i>

466
00:23:50,861 --> 00:23:52,696
Well, shrimping
and forest products

467
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,936
obviously uh... pays well.

468
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:57,900
- Look at the boats out there.
- I know, that is amazing, isn't it?

469
00:23:57,985 --> 00:24:00,256
You often see that. The
most humble of commodities

470
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:04,056
and it yields just incredible
wealth for a privileged few.

471
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:06,540
Yeah.

472
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:08,720
Right, we're now
leaving Cartagena

473
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:12,896
in our quest to find many
interesting animals to photograph,

474
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:16,204
including... a hippopotamus.

475
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:19,462
That's the tricky one.

476
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:24,686
Obviously, many difficult
challenges would lie ahead.

477
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:27,096
There'd be thick forests...

478
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:32,203
volcanoes...

479
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:36,176
treacherous
mountain passes...

480
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:37,776
Oh, Jesus!

481
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:40,096
And dreadful weather.

482
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:47,936
But we weren't unduly worried
because we were using cars.

483
00:24:48,478 --> 00:24:50,336
Photographers like to pretend

484
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:52,576
that everything is more
complicated than it needs to be.

485
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:54,892
So, you know,
boxes and lenses and bags -

486
00:24:54,978 --> 00:24:56,336
all the stuff
Richard Hammond's got.

487
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:59,216
Also wildlife photographers
like to pretend

488
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:01,296
that life
has to be difficult.

489
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:03,056
Live up a tree
for three weeks,

490
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:04,816
freeze yourself to death
on an iceberg

491
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,816
to take a picture of
a polar bear or whatever.

492
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:09,296
No. It can be comfortable.

493
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:11,616
The car can make
anything comfortable.

494
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:14,423
Drive up,
take your picture, drive off.

495
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:19,856
Sadly, though, while we were
covering the ground

496
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:21,595
quickly and comfortably,

497
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:25,439
photographic opportunities
were a bit sparse.

498
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:29,243
More cows. And a goat thing.

499
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,782
Yeah, not wild
or interesting.

500
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:35,336
No, fair enough,
I'll give you that.

501
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,853
Dead dog.

502
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,087
Oh, quite a sweet
dead dog, though.

503
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:42,696
Well, it was sweet
when it was alive.

504
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:46,696
Even our now mobile
colleague was having no joy.

505
00:25:46,901 --> 00:25:50,079
Come on out. Come on.

506
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,970
Oh, stop hiding behind the
damn tree, you little ♪♪♪♪

507
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:58,157
And annoyingly for me,
on these rural roads,

508
00:25:58,243 --> 00:26:01,495
the Jeep started to show
its true colours.

509
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:03,689
Oh, God.

510
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:06,175
Ooh, the ride's not good.

511
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:08,634
Oh, Jesus.

512
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:11,335
Ohh, I'm supposed
to be proving

513
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:14,936
that wildlife photography
is easy and comfortable.

514
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:17,296
Jeep's letting me down
a little bit on that front.

515
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:19,421
Aaargh.

516
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,775
Keen to have a break
from the relentless bouncing,

517
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:28,922
I suggested we stop to photograph
an animal everyone likes...

518
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:30,288
a donkey.

519
00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:34,923
Come on.

520
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:37,856
Aw.

521
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:43,360
However, my long lens saw
something rather disturbing.

522
00:26:44,741 --> 00:26:46,981
Come on, there's a man
in the back of shot.

523
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:49,860
Wait, hang on.

524
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:56,844
So, I went with
our translator

525
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:00,235
to talk to people
in the local village.

526
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:03,876
Could you ask... did...

527
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:09,016
Was that young man having
relations with that donkey

528
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:11,641
or did I miss-see something?

529
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:15,907
<i>SHE SPEAKS SPANISH...</i>

530
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:22,516
- OK.
- Si?

531
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:26,797
They say yes.
That's right.

532
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:30,282
- What did he say, normal?
- No, no trouble. At all.

533
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:32,096
- Normal.
- Normal?

534
00:27:32,181 --> 00:27:33,976
Si. Normal.

535
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:37,256
- So you've all...
- THEY SPEAK SPANISH...

536
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:39,496
enjoyed the company
of donkeys?

537
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:44,056
<i>THEY SPEAK SPANISH...</i>

538
00:27:50,781 --> 00:27:52,936
So they say that basically
that's the first wife,

539
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:55,008
the first lover
that they have.

540
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:57,800
That's nice.

541
00:27:57,954 --> 00:27:59,816
Are all the donkeys
fair game?

542
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:01,496
Every single donkey,
or just...

543
00:28:04,341 --> 00:28:06,536
All of them, male and female?

544
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:15,290
Oh, OK, no. Only female.

545
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:18,133
So they don't have sex
with male donkeys.

546
00:28:18,303 --> 00:28:20,303
That would be what, weird?

547
00:28:21,621 --> 00:28:24,096
So they said
down here somewhere.

548
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:25,696
Oh, hello.

549
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:27,211
Donkeys.

550
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,399
Oh, we'll be photographing
donkeys, then, I guess.

551
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:30,927
Excellent.

552
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:36,016
Right,
try not to make a noise.

553
00:28:36,101 --> 00:28:37,736
I shan't. Don't worry.

554
00:28:37,821 --> 00:28:40,136
Cos this one's
particularly timid.

555
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,576
Hang on.

556
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:46,896
We're leaving now.
Leave, now.

557
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:48,557
- What?
- We're leaving.

558
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:56,004
Ah, it seemed like
a really nice little place.

559
00:28:57,581 --> 00:28:59,941
Jeremy, why do we have to go?

560
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:04,581
Have you upset someone?

561
00:29:06,821 --> 00:29:08,776
He's either committed
some terrible faux pas

562
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:12,261
or he's got sunstroke -
he's very red in the face.

563
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:16,776
Why don't these Colombians
just grow something?

564
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:20,753
Surely there must be
a plant of some sort

565
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:23,760
that people living out in
the sticks could grow here,

566
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,893
and then sell
around the world...

567
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:30,589
rather than...
interfering with animals.

568
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,518
We continued onwards,

569
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:42,401
acutely aware that so far our
mission was not going well.

570
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:50,815
What photographs have
we got between us so far?

571
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:52,616
Have either of you two
got anything

572
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:54,616
you could put on
an Amazon screensaver?

573
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:56,936
I have a selfie
with a donkey.

574
00:29:57,021 --> 00:29:59,056
Yeah, you wouldn't wanna
use my donkey photograph,

575
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:00,856
that's for damn sure.

576
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:04,056
We've got nothing
between us so far at all.

577
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:06,449
But then...

578
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:10,214
No, wait. What's this?

579
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:13,297
Looks like a badger
having a massive poo.

580
00:30:13,714 --> 00:30:15,736
No, that's an anteater.

581
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,536
You're right, it is.
It's an anteater.

582
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:19,576
But it's only
a picture of one.

583
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:21,456
But what it's doing
is telling us

584
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:23,536
they cross the road here.

585
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,416
Well, hang on. If they cross
the road here, we just wait.

586
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:29,861
Why chase?

587
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:49,816
I think they've put the sign
in the wrong place,

588
00:30:49,901 --> 00:30:54,016
because...
no anteater has crossed here.

589
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:56,461
We've been now eight minutes.

590
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:03,669
Three minutes after that,

591
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:06,427
we realised we needed
to break out a map

592
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,700
and get radical.

593
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:12,669
Right, spectacled bears
don't live here.

594
00:31:13,011 --> 00:31:15,534
Neither do condors
and neither do jaguars.

595
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,232
So let's go to where...

596
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:20,224
Yeah, we're sort of here,

597
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,034
just outside Cartagena.

598
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,715
We need to come down...

599
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:28,296
I mean right down here, into
the Amazonian rainforest.

600
00:31:28,381 --> 00:31:31,176
National parks,
the mountains.

601
00:31:31,261 --> 00:31:33,376
What the pros do
is go to the right habitat.

602
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:36,661
I know that, because I'm leaning
on my camera, like a pro.

603
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:43,216
One of the main targets
on our hit list was the jaguar,

604
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,896
and they live mostly
in the region of Santander,

605
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:48,936
which was 400 miles away.

606
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:53,901
So we saddled up and settled
down for the long drive south.

607
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:03,696
I'd love to tell you how fast
my 49 horsepower is taking me

608
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:05,976
but the speedometer,
which is electronic,

609
00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:10,425
has stopped working since Richard
Hammond pulled me into the sea.

610
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:16,581
In a bid to pass the time,
I dreamed up a simple game.

611
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:20,112
Hammond, why don't you pull
alongside your colleague,

612
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:23,616
in his er... let's be honest,
1 litre Fiat Panda,

613
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:27,256
with your
7.4 litre monster truck,

614
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:30,198
and let's see who's got
the slowest car, OK?

615
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:33,221
Er, OK.

616
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:38,651
Three, two, one, go.

617
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:47,816
The little guy gets ahead.

618
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:50,667
It's James May.
James May is winning!

619
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:52,496
That's all I've got.

620
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:54,616
Ha!

621
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:57,096
Come on, Hammond!

622
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:59,307
That realistically is
all I have.

623
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:03,401
Easy.

624
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:07,893
Richard Trailer Trash Trump
Hammond has been beaten,

625
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,831
and beaten big time! Bigly!

626
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:13,496
I don't want you to take this
personally or anything, Hammond,

627
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:16,616
but your truck
must be utter garbage.

628
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:18,921
Absolute garbage.

629
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:23,135
You wait, this thing'll come into its
own soon and you'll be left gasping.

630
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:26,536
I'm longing to see
the environment

631
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:29,042
where that
comes into its own.

632
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:39,709
<i>SONG SUNG IN SPANISH...</i>

633
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:14,754
After many hours
in this,

634
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,379
the 25th biggest country
on Earth,

635
00:34:17,465 --> 00:34:20,489
we were finally
getting into jaguar country.

636
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:26,936
And the long journey had done
wonders for Hammond's

637
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,020
£11,000 pickup truck.

638
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:35,136
Current crop of warning lights on my
truck include engine service soon,

639
00:34:35,221 --> 00:34:37,582
some sort of
brake failure indicator,

640
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:40,376
anti-lock brake failure
indicator.

641
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:43,005
Lights I don't have is the one
that tells me what gear I'm...

642
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,090
Oh!

643
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:51,336
Ah.

644
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:53,376
Are we not concentrating,
Hammond?

645
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:56,256
I may have had a wee.

646
00:34:56,341 --> 00:35:00,856
It is one of the most stupid
pieces of engineering ever, that truck.

647
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:10,371
Since the jaguars weren't
going to be in built-up areas,

648
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:13,322
we ploughed deep
into the jungle,

649
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:18,496
along a dirt path that was once
a railway built by the British.

650
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,616
Right, Jaguars, they are
very difficult to spot

651
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:29,016
and very, very rare.

652
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:32,262
You don't want to come face to
face with a Jaguar, though.

653
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:36,121
Cos it does have
very strong bitey bits.

654
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:41,020
Kills its prey by biting through its
skull and then penetrating its brain.

655
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:46,867
This is proper jungle now.

656
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:54,221
Oh, hello.

657
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:58,696
I'm in a British railway tunnel.
Oh, no, Hammond.

658
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,650
Ohh, tunnel.

659
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:08,457
Stop it!

660
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:12,214
I had to do it, it's the law.

661
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:20,856
We drove for miles
along the disused railway,

662
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:25,817
until eventually,
LGB Jeremy came to a halt.

663
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:31,816
Gentlemen,
I'm rather confused here.

664
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,056
We're approaching a bridge,
OK?

665
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:39,262
It says no cars, no people,
no motorcycles and no horses.

666
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,336
Well, what's it for, then?

667
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:45,541
Moments later,
we found out.

668
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,548
It's all right, James, why
don't you just...

669
00:36:58,905 --> 00:37:00,340
He is actually going.

670
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:03,296
James doesn't like heights.

671
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,896
- Oh, did you see that one just move?
- Yes.

672
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:07,896
What is that? Hold on.

673
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:10,336
That's one, two.

674
00:37:10,421 --> 00:37:13,204
You've got seven,
maybe eight feet.

675
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:15,314
But that means I'll have
to drive... I can't...

676
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,496
You will.
It's got massive tyres.

677
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:19,016
You'll just be running on
the outer ones.

678
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:22,868
Well...
So I get to this bit...

679
00:37:24,501 --> 00:37:26,616
My car is wider than that,

680
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:28,856
and that's wider than
my wheel. It won't do it.

681
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:32,016
And that's high, actually.
What is that? 300 feet?

682
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:34,781
Some hundreds of feet, yes.

683
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,016
Oh, dear.

684
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:42,176
Even though Hammond
isn't at all accident prone,

685
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:44,536
I went first.

686
00:37:44,621 --> 00:37:47,056
Seat belt on or off?

687
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:48,536
Off.

688
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:50,896
Because what bloody
difference will it make?

689
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:52,876
Really.

690
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:01,470
Jesus.

691
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:06,052
Oh, God, there's a really,
really narrow bit there.

692
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:07,776
Ooh, ahh.

693
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:13,936
Oh, speed.

694
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:17,496
No, ah, I don't think
speed's the answer. Ah.

695
00:38:22,044 --> 00:38:24,719
Oh, oh.

696
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:27,774
Right. I've made it.
That's good.

697
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:31,666
Hammond, you will
shit your pants doing this.

698
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:33,258
Well, that's helpful.

699
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:37,016
I already am, watching.

700
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:42,352
Spider Man May shot across
as fast as he dared.

701
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,805
Not looking down,
not looking down,

702
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:47,774
thinking about other things.

703
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,395
And then it was the turn
of Big Donald.

704
00:38:55,945 --> 00:38:57,941
Oh, God.

705
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:05,616
Ah. Ah.

706
00:39:05,701 --> 00:39:08,376
The only way I can do this is by
looking at the driver's-side tyre,

707
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:11,136
and keeping it as close
as I can to that edge,

708
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:13,256
and hoping to God
that gives me enough.

709
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:15,221
Oh, Christ.

710
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:24,508
Oh, Jesus.
I'm shaking all over.

711
00:39:25,341 --> 00:39:26,816
I can do this.

712
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:28,266
I'm just gonna
look at the wood,

713
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:30,688
not at what's below,
just look at the wood.

714
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:34,235
Ah!

715
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:40,058
Jesus Christ, no,
I'm too close to the edge.

716
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:53,061
Argh. God!

717
00:39:56,581 --> 00:39:59,501
I think I might be sick.

718
00:40:01,453 --> 00:40:03,080
I will get there.

719
00:40:03,293 --> 00:40:05,955
Crossing this bridge
is just part of my journey.

720
00:40:10,424 --> 00:40:13,179
Who is that, clippety
clopping across my bridge?

721
00:40:13,265 --> 00:40:14,945
Oh, God!

722
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:19,776
Not the Billy Goat Gruff
game.

723
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:22,776
Mm, I will move my Jeep
out of your way

724
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:27,256
if you can answer this
simple prog rock question.

725
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,496
I don't know anything
about prog rock at all!

726
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:34,256
Who is the bass guitarist
in Barclay James Harvest?

727
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:37,421
The Nolan Sisters! Get me off
this **** bridge!

728
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:42,456
Let me off the bridge.
I'm gonna be sick. Please.

729
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:45,296
Eventually Hammond
became quite irritated,

730
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:47,496
so I abandoned the game

731
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:51,536
and soon all of us
became quite irritated.

732
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:55,456
There were more not
very well maintained bridges.

733
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,301
Oh, God in heaven.

734
00:41:00,621 --> 00:41:03,296
The heat was stifling...

735
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:04,936
and the ride in the Jeep

736
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:07,856
became more and more
intolerable.

737
00:41:07,941 --> 00:41:10,976
Not taking this punishment
very well.

738
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:13,781
Ohh.

739
00:41:14,901 --> 00:41:16,376
And then...

740
00:41:18,861 --> 00:41:21,221
James,
have you broken down?

741
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,016
Yes.

742
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:29,376
It's a very thoughtful place
to break down, this.

743
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:31,896
- Why is that?
- Well, because, look, there's a little path

744
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:33,336
Hammond and I
can go round.

745
00:41:33,421 --> 00:41:34,817
- He is absolutely right.
- Off you go.

746
00:41:34,902 --> 00:41:37,136
Leave it. Don't touch it.
Leave it.

747
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:40,151
- I'm trying to help.
- Don't try and help. Go away.

748
00:41:40,861 --> 00:41:44,656
Everybody's getting
a bit bad tempered.

749
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:48,604
Might be because it's so hot.
Could be that.

750
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:51,026
He's not very keen
on us helping, is he?

751
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,896
Sorry.

752
00:41:53,088 --> 00:41:55,016
- I couldn't see the bumper.
- I will punch your lights out

753
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:57,616
cos I had my head
right next to the thing.

754
00:41:57,701 --> 00:42:00,056
Go on. Go!

755
00:42:00,205 --> 00:42:02,416
It'll all be fine
if we spot a jaguar.

756
00:42:02,651 --> 00:42:03,936
Everything will be OK.

757
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,101
- Right.
- Go!

758
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:18,461
Oh, now we're in trouble.

759
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:22,256
Whoa!

760
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:24,016
Hammond!

761
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:27,655
You **** moron!

762
00:42:27,993 --> 00:42:30,176
- I didn't know you were there!
- Hammond!

763
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:32,056
What the **** hell
are you doing?

764
00:42:32,141 --> 00:42:34,016
I was stuck.

765
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:36,056
I didn't know
you were behind me.

766
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:38,256
Use your mirrors!

767
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,701
You totally smashed
the front of my car up.

768
00:42:47,021 --> 00:42:49,655
That really got out of hand,
all of a sudden.

769
00:42:50,215 --> 00:42:52,415
One minute going along,
everything's fine.

770
00:42:52,501 --> 00:42:56,856
Next minute, one of your mates is
throwing rocks at the other one.

771
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:59,936
Problem is, you have people on
the extreme left - James May -

772
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:02,536
people on the extreme right -
Richard Hammond -

773
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:07,736
and it's always the liberal, sensible
people in the middle, like me,

774
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:10,416
who cop for it.

775
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:14,056
Eventually,
having fixed the Fiat,

776
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:16,483
I was back on the road again.

777
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:19,983
This car is just amazing.

778
00:43:21,054 --> 00:43:24,129
But then...

779
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:28,967
Oh, dear. I think I've just
lost the exhaust pipe.

780
00:43:31,981 --> 00:43:34,006
Up ahead,
thanks mainly to

781
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:37,376
our absolutely beautiful
surroundings,

782
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:40,136
the mood was
a lot more tranquil.

783
00:43:42,781 --> 00:43:45,696
That scenery to our right
is absolutely spectacular.

784
00:43:45,781 --> 00:43:47,951
It is gorgeous, isn't it?

785
00:43:48,037 --> 00:43:51,576
Yeah. And of course we're not in
the shade of the jungle any more,

786
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:53,336
which means
I'm being roasted.

787
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:56,416
Have you not got any moisturiser
with you? You must have.

788
00:43:56,787 --> 00:43:59,696
No, Hammond, I don't have
any moisturiser with me.

789
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:07,147
Buenos dias.

790
00:44:07,361 --> 00:44:11,561
As it turned out, the broken
exhaust was lifting my mood too.

791
00:44:17,874 --> 00:44:21,381
This is tremendous. It's like
being on a rally stage.

792
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,561
I happen to know that
Tony and Cherie Blair were,

793
00:44:25,655 --> 00:44:28,186
in fact, massive World
Rally Championship fans.

794
00:44:28,272 --> 00:44:31,545
In fact, I think they took
part in a couple on the quiet.

795
00:44:31,631 --> 00:44:33,951
They just didn't want people
to know about it.

796
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:35,616
They thought it would sort of

797
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:38,776
damage their reputation
and their standing.

798
00:44:38,861 --> 00:44:41,647
Unlike, say, starting a war.

799
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:46,656
Further ahead, my long lens had
grabbed a couple of animals.

800
00:44:48,632 --> 00:44:50,967
I don't believe Amazon

801
00:44:51,053 --> 00:44:53,795
will be rushing to have that
as their screen saver.

802
00:44:54,097 --> 00:44:57,100
But we had yet to bag a jag.

803
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,616
However,
as it's a nocturnal animal,

804
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:03,381
we were hoping for more luck
as darkness fell.

805
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,746
Predictably, though...

806
00:45:06,261 --> 00:45:08,216
Are my headlights on?

807
00:45:08,702 --> 00:45:10,461
No, they're off completely.

808
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:13,941
I think I got sea water
in them.

809
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,741
As we set about
sorting the problem,

810
00:45:17,827 --> 00:45:19,742
Tony Blanquist arrived.

811
00:45:27,953 --> 00:45:30,228
Ooh. That can't...
Listen to it.

812
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,616
It sounds quite roarty,
doesn't it?

813
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:35,021
That is a throaty sound.

814
00:45:36,461 --> 00:45:38,936
James,
do not throw rocks at us.

815
00:45:39,021 --> 00:45:42,701
Just calm down, say some of
your Chinese things.

816
00:45:42,787 --> 00:45:44,696
I'm very sorry
for driving into your car.

817
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:47,376
I'm very sorry I threw a rock at you.
It wasn't at your head.

818
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:49,696
Right, so we're back
as a team.

819
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:52,056
- Yeah.
- I've said sorry to James.

820
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:53,816
- Yeah.
- He's said sorry to me.

821
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:55,336
- We're all OK.
- We've all said sorry.

822
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:58,096
Everybody's happy.

823
00:45:58,181 --> 00:46:02,696
Once we'd strapped some torches to
the front of the pickup Trump...

824
00:46:02,781 --> 00:46:05,334
we resumed our jaguar hunt.

825
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:14,136
Those torches are useless.

826
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:17,616
They're just illuminating trees
over there and the sky up there.

827
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:19,421
It's not helping anything.

828
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:25,456
Eventually, though, after
driving deep into the jungle,

829
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:28,536
we arrived at exactly
the sort of spot

830
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:31,346
where jaguars
like to hang out.

831
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:36,463
This is
extraordinarily promising.

832
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:41,557
But the most important thing,
of course, is to be quiet.

833
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:46,932
Nice and quietly does it,
while I set up my camera.

834
00:46:47,381 --> 00:46:53,073
Unfortunately, however, the "quiet"
memo didn't reach Donald and Tony.

835
00:46:54,901 --> 00:46:56,696
My lights are too high here!

836
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:58,456
I need to be parked.

837
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:01,456
Oh, for God's sake,
quietly, I said.

838
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:06,336
I'll stay down here,
then you'll be higher up.

839
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:08,576
All right, now I can't see
cos of your lights.

840
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:10,296
I was gonna go.

841
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:11,736
OK, mate,
I'm gonna hit the road.

842
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:13,776
You go that way
and check it out.

843
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:16,896
Have you two thought about
maybe being a bit quieter?

844
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:19,656
- You what?
- Little bit quieter, perhaps?

845
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:23,456
Oh, no, Jeremy, I'm too close
to you there, aren't I?

846
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,016
- No, that's fine.
- Sure?

847
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:26,936
- Yes, just turn it off.
- What?

848
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:30,016
- Just turn the engine off.
- What?

849
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:33,179
- Turn the engine off.
- Oh, right, yeah.

850
00:47:33,499 --> 00:47:35,136
Oh, sorry, it was in gear.

851
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:40,816
When my colleagues
were finally silent,

852
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:43,816
we settled down
to wait for a jaguar,

853
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:45,776
something which
the experts say

854
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:48,379
requires immense patience.

855
00:47:56,301 --> 00:48:00,136
I'm bored! I'm bored and
I'm getting eaten by mosquitos.

856
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:02,536
I'm being eaten
and I'm bored as well.

857
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:04,616
If a jaguar
came now, I wouldn't see it.

858
00:48:04,701 --> 00:48:06,736
My eyes have shut down...

859
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:08,536
from boredom.

860
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:11,776
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know, but that is boring.

861
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:13,799
No, cos honestly,
I mean the truth is,

862
00:48:13,885 --> 00:48:16,136
people could come out here
for 40 years

863
00:48:16,221 --> 00:48:18,936
and not see a jaguar.

864
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,856
Well, we could use
my trap cameras.

865
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,440
- Your what?
- What are trap cameras?

866
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,766
Set it up, and triggered by
an animal and take a picture.

867
00:48:25,981 --> 00:48:28,136
- You've got those with you?
- Yeah. In my bag.

868
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:30,713
Well, why the hell didn't you
say that when we turned up?

869
00:48:30,815 --> 00:48:31,896
Nobody asked.

870
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:36,244
I'm sorry, yes, Richard,
get your trap cameras out.

871
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,576
- What a great idea.
- Right, OK. Plan! I'll do it.

872
00:48:39,661 --> 00:48:40,869
Oh, I've just remembered,

873
00:48:40,955 --> 00:48:43,479
I've got a jaguar in the
boot, shall I let that out?

874
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:51,627
After a while, Hammond had carpeted
the area with his trap cameras.

875
00:48:57,981 --> 00:49:00,291
- Now what do we do?
- Wait.

876
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:03,176
We wait for an animal to walk
past one and set it off?

877
00:49:03,261 --> 00:49:05,776
- Yes.
- How do we know when it's gone off?

878
00:49:06,149 --> 00:49:08,349
Well, we just will.

879
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:14,296
Er... I need a dump.

880
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,176
- I'll alert the media.
- Well, I'm just saying.

881
00:49:17,261 --> 00:49:19,496
Don't worry,
I'm gonna sort myself out.

882
00:49:19,815 --> 00:49:21,416
Sorry.

883
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:24,073
- It's all this foreign food.
- Ssh.

884
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:28,393
He's not such a good
outdoors man's person

885
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:31,816
as he likes to think, cos I bet
he hasn't got any bog roll.

886
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,619
I'll bet you he'll just use
a smooth stone.

887
00:49:34,941 --> 00:49:36,656
- A smooth stone?
- Mmm.

888
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:38,296
That's what snipers use

889
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:41,016
when they're posted out
in the middle of nowhere.

890
00:49:41,352 --> 00:49:43,953
They wipe themselves
with a smooth stone.

891
00:49:44,469 --> 00:49:46,864
- Why a smooth stone?
- Well...

892
00:49:46,981 --> 00:49:48,856
presumably because
it's uncomfortable

893
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:50,376
to use a jaggedy one.

894
00:49:50,461 --> 00:49:52,296
Oh, yeah, but not...

895
00:49:52,381 --> 00:49:54,071
Well, you'd probably use a
leaf, actually, in the jungle.

896
00:49:54,156 --> 00:49:55,821
I mean...

897
00:49:55,981 --> 00:49:57,336
After much debate about

898
00:49:57,421 --> 00:50:00,296
how the special forces
wipe their bottoms,

899
00:50:00,381 --> 00:50:02,936
Hammond returned
and I quickly realised

900
00:50:03,164 --> 00:50:05,376
we were being thick.

901
00:50:05,821 --> 00:50:07,296
These are set off remotely?

902
00:50:07,813 --> 00:50:09,896
- Yeah. If an animal...
- Well, why are we still here?

903
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:11,416
That's a very good point,
actually.

904
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:13,456
It's better
that we go away, isn't it?

905
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:16,296
Let's take the Bear Grylls
approach to natural history.

906
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:18,696
There was a town,
well, ten kilometres away.

907
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:21,860
Why don't we go into
the town, have a drink,

908
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:23,898
- check into a hotel...
- How's that sound?

909
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:26,296
And then come back tomorrow
and check the cameras.

910
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:28,256
- Yes, yes.
- That's how you're supposed to use them.

911
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:30,696
It's in the instructions. That's
what you do. You set it up...

912
00:50:30,781 --> 00:50:34,376
This good news put me in
the mood for some mischief.

913
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,296
So, after May had
gone to bed at the hotel,

914
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:42,125
Hammond and I sneaked outside
to mess with his head.

915
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,376
- He parked his car there.
- Yes.

916
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:46,776
Turn it round.

917
00:50:46,861 --> 00:50:48,176
Oh, that'll
mess with his head.

918
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:50,256
So, in the morning,
can you imagine his face?

919
00:50:50,341 --> 00:50:53,117
Yeah, and he'll know exactly where
he parked it, cos it's him.

920
00:50:53,203 --> 00:50:56,133
So then he'll think...
he'll think he's gone mad.

921
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,711
- How are we gonna do it?
- Bounce it. Ready?

922
00:50:59,844 --> 00:51:04,256
- Oh, yeah.
- So one, two, three, move it.

923
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:07,711
One, two, three, move it.

924
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:10,576
One, two three, move it.

925
00:51:10,661 --> 00:51:12,301
One, two...

926
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:19,828
The next morning, with James
in a state of deep puzzlement,

927
00:51:19,938 --> 00:51:24,021
Hammond and I checked out
the ruined trap cameras.

928
00:51:25,621 --> 00:51:27,656
So let me
just get this clear.

929
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:29,442
The jaguar
mauled your camera?

930
00:51:29,528 --> 00:51:30,883
Yeah.

931
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:33,096
Is that really
where it's bitten it?

932
00:51:33,181 --> 00:51:34,818
- It's got bits come off.
- He's broken it.

933
00:51:34,903 --> 00:51:36,656
- Yes, he's broken it.
- But did we...

934
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:37,872
This is the important thing.

935
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:40,993
Did we get...
ahem, any pictures?

936
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:43,674
- Right, I'll have a look.
- No.

937
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:47,176
Er... something triggered it.
Maybe a leaf.

938
00:51:47,261 --> 00:51:49,416
- Ah, look, there!
- Where?

939
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:51,976
There. That's its...
That's it!

940
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:54,376
- That's it walking about.
- Look how camouflaged it is.

941
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:57,301
There's its head!
That's its actual face.

942
00:51:58,301 --> 00:51:59,496
There.

943
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:01,616
Yeah, but he's got a tree
in front of him.

944
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,976
Yeah, but that's context,
that's habitat.

945
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:05,736
What's that?

946
00:52:05,821 --> 00:52:07,936
This is when it got
destroyed. That's its...

947
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:10,023
That's its mouth.
That's whiskers, look.

948
00:52:10,109 --> 00:52:11,515
- No!
- That's its...

949
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:13,556
That's a jaguar biting.

950
00:52:14,124 --> 00:52:15,856
That is an action shot.

951
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:17,736
That's probably
got awards all over it.

952
00:52:17,821 --> 00:52:19,856
- Oh, yeah.
- Eyes.

953
00:52:21,843 --> 00:52:24,256
Now, that is a great picture
and we can move on.

954
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:26,456
- It is.
- We have ticked that box.

955
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:28,416
That's the Ace of Spades,
the jaguar.

956
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:30,335
That's Saddam Hussein.

957
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:32,861
We've now gotta go
and get his sons...

958
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,875
...Uday and the other one.

959
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:38,136
What was his
other son called?

960
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:42,341
Edgar.

961
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:47,404
We now have to drive
200 miles

962
00:52:47,661 --> 00:52:52,936
to photograph the King
of Spades, Edgar Hussein...

963
00:52:53,021 --> 00:52:54,536
Paddington.

964
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:56,056
Oh, shite!

965
00:52:56,141 --> 00:52:57,336
Oh-ho!

966
00:52:57,421 --> 00:52:59,976
Oh-ho, look at you
with a wheel in the air!

967
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:01,456
Gravity gets you down there

968
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:04,176
and then you simply
drive up the other side.

969
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:07,096
Oh, God!

970
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:08,376
Stop. Stop, stop, stop!

971
00:53:08,461 --> 00:53:10,856
Stop there. Stop there.
It's gonna break.

972
00:53:12,781 --> 00:53:14,301
It's a bear!
It's a bear!

973
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:19,660
We've been told
we're at 15,500 feet.

974
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:23,637
Nothing for it,
we've gotta go higher...

975
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,970
...to find Colin Condor.

976
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:29,816
Oh, that's proper boiling.

977
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:31,656
You're destroying our cars,

978
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:34,616
you've got oxygen for you
and your car only,

979
00:53:34,701 --> 00:53:37,496
and we can see nothing!

980
00:53:38,741 --> 00:53:41,576
We're 250 miles
from the Equator.

981
00:53:41,661 --> 00:53:44,336
We're on a volcano
in a severe hailstorm.

982
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:47,224
It's bouncing in
through the back.

983
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:51,125
How much hail
is there in the sky?

984
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:55,671
