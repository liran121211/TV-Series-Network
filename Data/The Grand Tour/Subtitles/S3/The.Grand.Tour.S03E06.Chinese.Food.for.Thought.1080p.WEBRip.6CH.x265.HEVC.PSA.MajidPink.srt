Hello!

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,040
Thank you so much, everybody.
Thank you. Now...

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,520
Coming up
in this week's show:

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,040
A supercar
is dismantled for no reason.

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,120
A man with no shirt on.

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,600
And my whole tongue
is wrapped up in intestine.

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
My whole tongue
is wrapped up in intestine.

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,480
Those are the highlights.

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,960
-Those are the best bits.
-Yep.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,280
They really are.

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,920
Anyway...
over here in the West,

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,920
we tend to think
that at £360,000

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,080
a Rolls Royce Phantom
is quite expensive.

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,760
But this week, The Grand Tour
is focusing mostly on China.

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,920
And over there,
things are a bit different.

(INSECT BUZZING)

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,720
JEREMY: Not that long ago,
China was full of old,
bent-over rice-farmer ladies,

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,120
up to their ankles in mud.

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,120
But these days,
things have changed a bit.

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,280
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,080
As recently as the 1980s,

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,720
people here
would lie awake at night

32
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
dreaming of
having enough money...

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,760
...to buy a mule.

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,680
Whereas now,
just 30 years later,

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,000
they dream of being able
to buy a Hongqi.

36
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,440
Specifically this Hongqi -
the L5.

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,520
In Chinese,
Hongqi means "the red flag",

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,560
the symbol
of communism.

39
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,520
But there's nothing
at all communistical

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
about this monster's
price tag.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,720
Which is £880,000.

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,360
The interior is
an exquisite work of art

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,080
with rosewood panelling
and cream leather.

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,560
The dashboard and centre
console are fully digital.

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
There's jade in
the door handles

46
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,720
and golden sunflowers
everywhere else.

47
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,560
I only saw this thing for the
first time a few moments ago

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,880
and already I'm in love.

49
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,720
I love the way each door
weighs the same as
a medium-sized mountain.

50
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,600
I love the red flags here
and on the bonnet.

51
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,080
I love the flagpoles.

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,760
It's like... it's like
a cartoon baddie's car,

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,640
cos in real life
nobody could be that bad.

54
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
I mean, it's impossible!

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,440
One thing the Hongqi doesn't
have is armour plating,

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,000
but even so,

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,200
it weighs
just shy of 3.2 tons.

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,440
Now to move this
enormous weight around,

59
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,200
it's fitted with
a six-litre V12 engine

60
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,200
which turns petrol
into silence.

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,920
It's not particularly
comfortable, though.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,440
The seats especially
are very hard.

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,360
And the steering wheel
adjuster button is broken

64
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,920
and there are no cup holders.

65
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,760
And it certainly isn't fast.

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,240
In fact, it has the same
power-to-weight ratio
as a Peugeot 308 diesel.

67
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,800
Hongqi won't say
what the 0 to 60 time is.

68
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,800
I suspect because
it won't actually do 60.

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,200
You know what, though?
I don't care
about any of that,

70
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,360
because it is just
magnificent and evil.

71
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,880
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

72
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,000
Gloriously, brilliantly evil.

73
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,240
Despite its villainous
presence, though,

74
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,360
the price is mad.

75
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,360
So, I called May and Hammond

76
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,720
and we came up with an idea.

77
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,440
If you are a Chinese
businessman or
businessman-woman,

78
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,600
and you want a car
that reflects your status,

79
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,280
you don't need
to spend £880,000.

80
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,480
You can simply
pop over to Europe

81
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,960
and buy a Mercedes S-Class,
like this one.

82
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,800
And even though
this is the 6-litre V12,

83
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,200
it cost me just £8,800.

84
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,280
In other words, you could
have 100 of these
for the price of a Hongqi.

85
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,560
At this point, my colleague
Richard Hammond arrived in...

86
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,040
something or other.

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,400
What is that?

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,640
This is a Cadillac STS
and you can shut up.

89
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,200
-I wasn't gonna say anything.
-Good.

90
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,840
Because this is fitted
with one of the
best engines of all time.

91
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,320
The creamy smooth,
4.6-litre Northstar V8.

92
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Making 300
all-American horsepower.

93
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,320
That engine was designed
so it can run
for up to 100 miles

94
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,800
with no coolant in it at all,

95
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,040
by shutting down one bank
of the V8 until it cools

96
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,520
and then the other one,
and then the other one.
That is clever.

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,280
-And front-wheel drive?
-Yeah?

98
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,720
It's a luxury car.
Who cares what wheels
are being driven, James?

99
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,480
Well, people who care
about torque steer,
weight distribution,

100
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,200
-dignified engineering,
doing things properly.
-All right.

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,520
I'll cancel all the track
days I've entered in it

102
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,080
and I'll just drive around
in it as a luxury car.

103
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,360
Anyway, this is the Mercedes
S-Class, which, as we know,

104
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,760
is really a sort of paradigm
for the luxury car

105
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,120
and it's a pioneer of many
things that are new on cars

106
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,280
and that we come to see
as standard some years later.

107
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,480
For example...

108
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,320
-first car to have...
-Soft-close doors.

109
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
How many miles has it done?

110
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,840
180...000.

111
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
RICHARD:
Yeah, well, I figured.

112
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,840
-Where did your car
come from?
-Germany.

113
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,520
-A German...
-Mm-hm.

114
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,320
...bought a Cadillac?

115
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,160
We were then interrupted

116
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,560
by the arrival of Clarkson
in a BMW.

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,560
Ooh, I see you've
bought the long car.

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,280
-Yours is long as well.
-Are you two beamed
from the 1970s?

119
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,080
-No, they're long-wheel base
and this is long.
-It is long.

120
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,880
This is the BMW 750 IL,

121
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,280
as Q called it in the Bond
film Tomorrow Never Dies.

122
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,720
JAMES: Did he?
BOTH: He did.

123
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,240
-Nobody told him?
-Nobody on set said,

124
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,080
"Desmond,
that's not what it says."

125
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,040
You would think,
wouldn't you? Oh, well.

126
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,800
And in the film,
they use 740s rebadged.

127
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,320
JAMES: Do they?
-Yeah. This is the real deal.

128
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,320
-The 5.4 litre V12.
JAMES: Hmm.

129
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,120
And all I paid for it
was £8,400.

130
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,560
That is one hell
of a lot of car.

131
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,960
I only paid £3,000
for my Cadillac.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,440
That's a Cadillac.

133
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,400
Yes, the point I'm gonna make
is what kind of a moron

134
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,080
in Germany said,

135
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,480
"Zere's Audi, zere's BMW,
zere's Mercedes.

136
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,920
I should buy a Cadillac."

137
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,640
In fact, I know exactly.
You know those Germans

138
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,320
you see that think
they're Hell's Angels?

139
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,720
-They're dentists, but they
have Harley Davidsons.
-Yes?

140
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,320
And they go
to the Oktoberfest
and they drink Budweiser.

141
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,720
Yes, well, I know
the Germans you mean.

142
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,240
No, it... You're wrong.

143
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,720
Because the previous
owner of that car

144
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,000
was an American
general living in Germany.

145
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,400
-Was he?
-A general?

146
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
An American general
and he bought that because

147
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,400
he recognised what Cadillac
intended with that car,

148
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,080
which is to take
on Audi, BMW, Mercedes,

149
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,280
directly with that car
with the Northstar engine.

150
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,600
Oh, yes, they were
very successful with that,
Europe is full of Cadillacs.

151
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,840
-Yeah, you see them
everywhere.
-You never see an Audi.

152
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,640
JEREMY: Tripping over these.
-Rarity and exclusivity are part
of luxury.

153
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,520
-Let's have a look at yours.
-Mine, honestly,
is in perfect nick.

154
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,040
-It's um...absolutely fine.
-I saw that. I saw that.

155
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,280
-Saw what? Nothing to see.
-That's got double glazing
in it and has gone wrong.

156
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, wait a minute,
is your... Come on!

157
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,600
What's the disease?
It's got...

158
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,160
-James, is that
between the panes?
-Yeah, it's got mumps.

159
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,120
That's the most depressing -
a double-glazed window
with mildew in-between it.

160
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
-What's the matter?
-You've got mildew
inside your windows.

161
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,520
-Where?
-There.

162
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,040
-Well, it's just, it's...
-That's really poor.

163
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,200
Oh, my God! Basically,
it's disappearing
before your eyes.

164
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,520
JAMES: How can a German car...
Sure it's a real one?

165
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,400
Was it parked in the sea
when you bought it?

166
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,520
Let's not get bogged down
with the oxidisation
of my car.

167
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,120
Because a lot of Chinese
people, as we know,
come to Europe these days.

168
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
Mostly to go to the
Mr Shopping Village.

169
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,120
Which is now a bigger tourist
attraction for the Chinese
in England

170
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,720
than Buckingham Palace -
true fact.

171
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,280
-Anybody else find that faintly
depressing?
-Very depressing.

172
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,200
If Chinese people
are going to come to the UK

173
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,880
and buy Western soap
and Western frocks,

174
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,480
why would they not
buy Western cars
when they're there?

175
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,520
RICHARD: Yeah,
you can't buy these cars
second-hand over here.

176
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,640
-No, this vintage isn't
available here.
-No.

177
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,040
JAMES: No.
-Because when these cars were
new, everyone in China had...

178
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,880
-Bicycles.
-Yes! Or oxen.

179
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
-Yeah.
-And what we're saying is,

180
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,840
you can buy one of these

181
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,000
for a lot less than
a luxury Hongqi.

182
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,520
-A lot, lot less.
-And that's what we're here
to prove, people of China.

183
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,600
JEREMY: We couldn't have
chosen a better location
for our test -

184
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,640
the absolutely mind-blowing
city of Chongqing.

185
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,000
Let me give you a few facts
and figures, if I may,
about Chongqing.

186
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,080
Population in the municipal
area of around 30 million,

187
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,120
so it's one of the biggest
cities in the world.

188
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,400
14 different car makers here,
so it's China's Motown.

189
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,880
And it's the capital
of the Chinese
motorcycling industry.

190
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,400
And they made
100 million laptops
here last year.

191
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,360
Apparently the city is
twinned with Leicester
and you can see why.

192
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,520
Apart from...
everything about it.

193
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,440
Oh, look, a train going
through a building.

194
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,720
Obviously.

195
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,520
It's an
amazing-looking place.

196
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,520
The people of Dubai think
they're good at knocking up
a building quickly,

197
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
but look at the stuff
being built here.

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,400
JEREMY: Of course when a city
gets this big, this fast,

199
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,880
there are many ways
to make money.

200
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,760
There's steel

201
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,240
and glass

202
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,560
and concrete.

203
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,440
But one man thought,
"Hold on,

204
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,640
every one of the rooms
in every one of
those buildings...

205
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,240
..is going to need a door."

206
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,120
Genius.

207
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,960
No brainer on the Dragons'
Den, that's for sure.

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,840
It was such a good idea,
he now has
a drive-through door factory.

209
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,560
RICHARD: Security doors,

210
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
front doors,
interior doors...

211
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,320
...really
fancy-shmancy doors.

212
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,080
Ornate doors,
bank vault...

213
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,040
Car doors.

214
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,880
JEREMY: Five million
of them last year:
five million doors.

215
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,840
Well, that's not very
interesting, is it?

216
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,640
Yes, but now I'm
the richest man in the world.

217
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,120
"If employee
is angel overtime,

218
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,920
it is not devil
when they get salary."

219
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,920
OK, he's not
a brilliant writer,
but what a maker of doors!

220
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,280
JEREMY: The most noticeable
thing about Chongqing,
though...

221
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,560
...is the heat.

222
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,360
This is called
the furnace of China.

223
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,120
Average daily temperatures,
this time of year, which is,
mid-July,

224
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,080
45 degrees.

225
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,040
With 80% humidity.

226
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,760
This place is hot.

227
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,520
Like mega hot.

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,760
It's so hot and so sticky

229
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,320
that five minutes after
putting up a building,

230
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,680
the jungle
is growing out of it.

231
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,520
And this is OK

232
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,760
if you're in
an air-conditioned BMW

233
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,040
or Cadillac.

234
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,760
However...

235
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,920
I'm gonna have to tell you
that the air-conditioning

236
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
simply doesn't work
in my car.

237
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,600
Please, no. Not here.

238
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,600
Have you heard the news?
James's aircon.

239
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,240
-What?
-(MOUTHS)

240
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,960
Oh, dear.

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,480
-(LAUGHS)
-Oh!

242
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,360
Oh, that...
he's gonna feel that.

243
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,320
-Ho-ho!
-(LAUGHS)

244
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,000
JEREMY:
Aircon issues aside, though,

245
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,000
it did seem like we were
on to something with our

246
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,240
pre-owned Western limousines.

247
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,240
Cars here cost round about

248
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,200
twice as much
as they do in the UK

249
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
because of taxes and...

250
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
profiteering
from the car companies.

251
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,480
So if you see someone
in a Range Rover Velar
as I just did,

252
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,200
that here is £140,000.

253
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,960
Yeah, I mean, that S-Class
there, if that's a tasty one,

254
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,320
that's a £300,000 car
in China.

255
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,800
And that's why
this BMW makes sense.

256
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,320
You could come to Europe,

257
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,160
pick up a 750IL like this
for £8,500,

258
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,880
pay for the shipping
to China, pay the taxes,

259
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,880
and it would still cost you
less than a Honda Civic.

260
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,000
And it's not like this
is on its last legs.

261
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,400
I don't have a single thing
in here that's broken.

262
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,000
Steering wheel adjuster,

263
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,280
unlike in the Hongqi,
is working.

264
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Indicators, lights, stereo -
everything. Everything works.

265
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,440
Windows.

266
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,680
I've even got
a cassette player.

267
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,200
Look at that.

268
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,280
RICHARD: All my electrics
were working too.

269
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,520
But actually,
in this superheated-city,

270
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,400
there's an even better reason
for buying a Cadillac.

271
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,920
When Americans build a car,

272
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,320
they start with the
air-conditioning unit

273
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,760
and then say, "Right,
let's fit a car to it.

274
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,560
It's top priority."

275
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,160
Speaking of which...

276
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,760
What this is, viewers,
if you were wondering,

277
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,440
is something called
an ice towel.

278
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,440
You soak it in water and
it remains cool
for up to two hours.

279
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,520
Borrowed it from one of
the crew. It's fantastic.

280
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,360
JEREMY: Eventually,
we decided to leave

281
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,120
the centre of the biggest
city you've never heard of.

282
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,000
So we negotiated

283
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,760
this gentleman's
sausage-shaped junction

284
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,200
to try our cars
on the freeway.

285
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,960
Where, immediately,
we had a problem.

286
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
(CLICKING)

287
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,160
Every few hundred yards,

288
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,360
there's a gantry with cameras
covering all the lanes.

289
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,960
And every single car
is photographed.

290
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,640
And every single photograph
is then analysed by...

291
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,920
..an official in a room
to make sure
the driver is smoking.

292
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,800
Because as far
as I can work out,

293
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,480
that is still
compulsory here.

294
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,320
Other things -
well, they're making sure

295
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,840
that you have
your seatbelt done up,

296
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,280
that you're not talking
on a mobile phone.

297
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,920
And that you're not...

298
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,920
Oh, how can I put this?

299
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,160
...touching either yourself
or your passenger.

300
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,040
Apparently
that's a thing in China.

301
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,320
Quite a few people
are prosecuted
for pleasuring themselves,

302
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,200
or one another,
on a long journey.

303
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,680
JAMES: Yes! Oh, yes.

304
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,760
Ohh! Oh, yes.

305
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,720
That is...
that's actually really nice.

306
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,560
Ow!
Shit, I've fanned my todger.

307
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,080
JEREMY: Eventually,
we arrived at the location

308
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,280
for our first test.

309
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,240
It's one of 78 centres
around Chongqing

310
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,880
where teenagers can learn to
drive away from the traffic.

311
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,320
To us, however,
it looked like a racetrack.

312
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,680
Which made it perfect for
an ingenious handling test

313
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,280
that I'd just thought of.

314
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,520
Now, to do this, we're gonna
use drones, like this one,

315
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,960
which have been fitted
with flamethrowers.

316
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,320
They actually use these
in China for clearing um...

317
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,640
litter that's got stuck
on overhead power cables.

318
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,800
Right. So how are we
going to use airborne
flamethrowers, like this,

319
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,880
to test the power
and agility of our cars?

320
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,680
Good question.
Each of our cars has,
as you can see,

321
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,280
been fitted with
three chains of firecrackers.

322
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,560
One on the bonnet,
one on the roof,
one on the boot lid. OK?

323
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,320
So you drive round
a special course here,

324
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,280
while you're attacked by
the airborne flamethrowers.

325
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,440
And then you score a point
when you've finished

326
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,800
for every one of the targets
that haven't gone off.

327
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,520
Since we were up against
two geeky millennials

328
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,040
and we'd be driving
powerful Western saloons,

329
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
we figured we could
outrun and outsmart

330
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,560
the drones easily.

331
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,800
♪ Flight Of The Valkyries

332
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,760
-(TYRES SCREECH)
-Sadly, though,
it was a massacre.

333
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,560
-Ah, fire from the sky!
-(FIRECRACKERS POP)

334
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,040
Agh! Agh!

Oh, no! Oh, shit!

347
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,160
-That will have alarmed him.
-It will have slightly, yeah.

dogs don't like fireworks?
-No, they hate it.

That was such a good laugh.

with airborne flamethrowers.

353
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,320
-Really good afternoon,
that was.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

354
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,640
-What?
-Hang on.

355
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,080
-Yeah?
-That was
a totally useless test.

356
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,280
-Why was it?
-Well, we did nothing

357
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
to convince
Chinese business people

358
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
that our second-hand limos
were a good idea.

359
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
And we all scored nought.

360
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,560
-Yeah, and we all ruined
our paintwork as well.
-Yes, but it'll buff out.

361
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,040
-No, it won't.
-Well, it might.

362
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,160
Anyway, we shall pick
that up later on.

363
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,000
But now, it is time for us

364
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,440
to splash
in some puddles of chat...

365
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,200
-(LAUGHTER)
-...left by
the drizzle of debate

366
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,320

(LAUGHTER)

369
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,800
RICHARD: I like that one.
I like that one.
-Yeah, I know.

370
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,160
Damn.

371
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,040
We'll stick with China.
If we may.

372
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,240
Um...before we were allowed
to drive over there,

373
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,440
we all had to sit
Chinese driving tests.

374
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
Now, we've seen driving tests
around the world.

375
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,400
I remember one in India
I encountered once,

376
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,720
where a woman passed,
even though she was
in the back of the car.

377
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,160
And her examiner
was in another car

378
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,160
-following along behind.
-Yeah.

379
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,560
Used to be in Egypt
that you had to drive
six feet forwards,

380
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,320
but then six feet backwards
and then you'd pass.

381
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,640
-And that was it.
-I'd love to meet somebody
who failed that.

382
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,560
Yeah. Anyhow,
so we figured that
to get a Chinese driving test

383
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,800
it would be, you know,
quite an easy test.

384
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
However, we were
in for a bit of a surprise.

385
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,760
Now, um...I actually
got some footage
of Hammond taking his test.

386
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,360
-Does anyone wanna see it?
AUDIENCE: Yes!

387
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,360
It's poor quality, it's on
my phone, but here we go.

388
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,120
JEREMY:
Test centre.

389
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,560
Right, so he has
to ball his fists.

390
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,960
Then a squat. There he goes.
There he goes.

391
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,160
And then he has to get
on some weigh scales.

392
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,400
Tense moment here,
tense moment.

393
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,360
Still tense.

394
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,320
You passed!
Hammond has passed!

395
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,600
-(LAUGHTER)
-Seriously...

396
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,120
-(APPLAUSE)
-Well done.

397
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,120
-That was it.
-Yes!

398
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,280
It was nothing.
I made it look easy.

399
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,840
That was, well,
it was the easiest driving
test I've ever heard of.

400
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,480
Basically I passed because I
proved that my hands do that

401
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,280
and I'm affected by gravity.

402
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,080
-That's it.
-I think it is actually
just a test to check

403
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,080
that you are a human being
and not a dog.

404
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,480
-Cos they can't...
-Sure it was.
However, afterwards,

405
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,240
we were taken in
to a sort of lecture theatre

406
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,560
by a man who...

407
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,280
talked us through the perils
of the road in China.

408
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,000
And he said that
we had to look out
for a number of things

409
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,960
running out into the road,
in front of us.

410
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,240
Including, and I'm not -
this is a quote, yes?

411
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,320
You will back me up on this.
This is what he said.

412
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,160
Including dogs, children,
and women.

413
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,160
-(LAUGHTER)
-That's what he said.

414
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,320
-He said that.
-"Be careful,
they run out into the road."

415
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,280
"You never know,
they're unpredictable."

416
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
(LAUGHTER)

417
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,280
I don't think
the #MeToo movement

418
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,040
has reached
Chongqing just yet.

419
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,720
No. Mind you,
you say that,

420
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,560
there are 78 self-made
billionaire women
in the whole world.

421
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,680
-And 49 of them are Chinese.
-Yeah.

422
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,120
Well, there would be more,
but some of them
got run over.

423
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,720
(LAUGHTER)

424
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,320
Anyway, look, can we talk
about that Hongqi for a bit?

425
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,840
I knew you'd
want to talk about that.

426
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,920
-It's so you.
-It's interesting.

427
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,000
-It's so you.
-It's got him
written all over it.

428
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,480
Bad news, though,
you can't have it in brown.

429
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,280
Why would I want it in brown?

430
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,760
-Oh, yes, you would.
-You love a brown car.

431
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,760
Your cars are grey
and dark green.

432
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,320
Mine are blue, metal fake,
red, and orange.

433
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,960
I can't see into your mind.

434
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,360
God knows
I'm not sure I want to.

435
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,800
But...I know James May,

436
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,680
as you drift off
to sleepy bobos tonight,

437
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,840
a brown Hongqi
will be driving...

438
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,200
(LAUGHTER)

439
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,920
"But I don't like
brown cars."

440
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,680
-It's like him saying,
"I love horses."
-Ha-ha.

441
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,000
Things that aren't true.
Things that aren't true.

442
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
You love a brown car and you
can't have it in brown.

443
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,440
I've never had a brown car
and I am interested
in the Hongqi.

444
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,280
-So tell us more about it.
-OK.

445
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,520
Something I didn't say
in the film, which is
quite interesting,

446
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,840
is that when you order one,
they send a tailor round
to your place of business.

447
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,760
And he measures
you up for a suit

448
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,600
that you then wear when you
take delivery of the car.

449
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,360
-Really?
-Yeah.

450
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,120
I'd actually quite like
to be the tailor

451
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,440
who made the suit for you

452
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,680
when you take delivery
of your Hongqi.

453
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,440
It would have
some writing on it.

454
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,640
-Would it?
-Not in Chinese,
it would be in English.

455
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,960
Would it be a pithy
description of the wearer?

456
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,520
Yes, that's what it was.

457
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,400
It's funny you
should say that, because...

458
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,760
in China there's a tendency
for people to wear clothing

459
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,880
with English words,
you know, written on them.

460
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,840
They've obviously got no idea
what those words say.

461
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,640
I was sitting in
a traffic jam one day there

462
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,800
and there was a woman
on a bus next to me.

463
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,400
And she was
a perfectly respectable,
50-something woman

464
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,800
on her way obviously
to an office job or whatever.

465
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,040
She was wearing
a white blouse
with red flowers on it.

466
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,360
Now, I took a picture.
Here it is.

467
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,000
And what that says is,
"He was a (BLEEP) asshole."

468
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,240
(LAUGHTER)

469
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,960
I would love a picture
of her face when somebody

470
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,920
explained to her
what it said on her shirt.

471
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,440
Do you know what's really
amazing about that?

472
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,520
That's exactly what
I was gonna have
put on your Hongqi suit.

473
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,520
-She knew.
-She knew!

474
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,080
I wanna get back to cars,
if I may.

475
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,480
Because there's some truly
astonishing stats, really,

476
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,040
about cars in China.

477
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,960
We've got a graph here of
global car production, yes?

478
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,240
There's the UK
in tenth place.

479
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,880
We made 1.67 million cars
here in 2017.

480
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,760
Japan 8.35 million.

481
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,360
China, let's put it up.

482
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,080
RICHARD: Mind-blowing!
-24.8 million cars
they made there.

483
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,760
And what's extraordinary is
that you can't just buy a car
and then use it.

484
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,000
You have to apply to a
government-run lottery

485
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,560
for a registration plate
for your car.

486
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,560
Now here's one, OK?

487
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,720
In Beijing last year,
for every thousand people

488
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,960
who applied
for a registration plate

489
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,360
for a car
they intended to buy...

490
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,840
For every thousand
who applied,

491
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,760
how many do you think
actually got one?

492
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,960
-500.
-200.

493
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,680
-600.
BOTH: 300.

494
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,280
-Three.
-Three people?

495
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,160
For every thousand people
who applied,

496
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,920
only three actually got
a registration plate,

497
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,040
were allowed to buy a car.

498
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,840
This is good conversation,
this whole issue actually.
It's really interesting.

499
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,040
Would you like to guess
what was the bestselling car
in China in 2017?

500
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,360
Well, Volkswagen have been
there forever, so I'm
gonna say the Passat.

501
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,080
I'm gonna say
it's a mid-sized Hyundai

502
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,360
-of some sort,
sort of boxy thing.
-And you're both wrong.

503
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,680
It's the Wuling Hongguang.

504
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
-(LAUGHTER)
-What, that?

505
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,200
Yep, there it is.
That's the fella.

506
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,600
That's the bestselling-car
in China?

507
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,920
They sold half a million
of them in China in 2017.

508
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,720
-Really?
-Half a million
of those were sold, yeah.

509
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,600
They sold... Well,
half a million of...Wu...

510
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,160
-Wuling Hongguang.
-Those.

511
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,160
That's more than
the Ford Focus.

512
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,640
Yeah, and don't forget the
Ford Focus is sold globally.

513
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,800
That's just sold in China.

514
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,880
The car, the Chinese car,
that caught my eye,
I must say,

515
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,120
was the Bestune T77.

516
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,040
-Familiar with it?
-Oh, the Best... No.

517
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,280
-Never heard of it.
-No, exactly.

518
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,160
We've got
a picture of it here.

519
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,480
It looks a bit like the
Lamborghini from last week,
the Urus.

520
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,160
But it's much smaller, 1.2-litre
engine SUV.
All quite normal.

521
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,320
Except it comes
with something called
a dashboard assistant.

522
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,680
Which is a little holographic
figure that pops up

523
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,960
and you talk to it and it
helps you set the satnav

524
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,200
-and make phone calls
and so on.
-That's very hi-tech.

525
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,480
Except the little holographic
figure is of a Japanese -

526
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,920
a Japanese schoolgirl.

527
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,400
And then you can choose
what colour miniskirt
you'd like her to wear.

00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,160
I'm not sure about that.

531
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,720
I'm not either, but here's
the thing, James,

532
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,240
the Chinese don't care
what we think, anybody.

533
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,240
Cos they look at us
like we look at cows.

534

We're just big daft things
standing around.

535
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,360

we give them luggage
and watches.

That's actually the end
of Conversation Street.

538

It's not the end, however,
of the Chinese stuff.

539
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,960
Because we had a call the
other day from a Chinese car
manufacturer called NIO.

540
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,600
And they said, "We have built
a blisteringly fast,
all-electric supercar.

541
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,800
And would one of you
like to try it out?"

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,920

Richard Hammond said
that he really didn't think
he was the man for the job.

545
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,520
However, it turned out

546
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,600
that the car was only
available for one day

547
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,320
and unfortunately
on that day, I had the
boiler man coming round.

548
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,240
-Yeah. And I had
a dental appoint...
-Dentist.

549
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,680

550
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,680

553
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,560
It's called the EP9.

554
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,960
And it's pretty clear
that this is no Nissan Leaf.

555
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,320
Because a Leaf doesn't have
giant head restraints

And that's
just the start of it.

559
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,640
What I have here
is a comparison

560
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,040
between this NIO EP9

561
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,240

tumble down
a Swiss mountainside.

564
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,360
So in the Rimac Concept One,

power:
1,207 brake horsepower.

In this NIO,
1,341 brake horsepower.

Power to weight:
in the Rimac is 652

00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,840
In this NIO,

Now if you want to experience
this phenomenal speed
for yourself,

599
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,520
you will need two things.

600
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,720
First of all, a lot of money.

601
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,800
Because this costs
£1.15 million.

602
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,240
Secondly, a racetrack.

603
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,560
Because it works like
that Ferrari FXX -

604
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,320
where you buy the car, they
deliver it to a track for you

605
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,880
along with a support team.

606
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,000
You drive it, crap yourself,

607
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,520
then they take it away
and hose it out for you.

608
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,200
Since it's an electric car,

609
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,520
you'll be wondering
about range.

610
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,160
Obviously if you hammer it
round a track,

611
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,760
you are gonna wear those
batteries out pretty quickly.

612
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,840
However, on the plus side,

613
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,600
they only take
45 minutes to charge.

614
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,440
On the minus side,

615
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,560
you have to take
the batteries out to do it.

616
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,160
And as they weigh
317 kilograms each,

617
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,000
you won't be doing that
on your own.

618
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,560
It is a bit more of a faff
than say, a can of petrol.

619
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,000
However, if you're
an electric petrol head

620
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
and you're tempted
by the NIO,

621
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,520
you might be
interested to know

622
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,080
that it's not
short of pedigree.

the EP9 itself
held a lap record
around the Nurburgring,

I need to go anywhere?

668
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,880
Yeah, that's all very well,
but a lot of people

669
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,840
are more enlightened than
you, including me, in fact.

670
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,360
-So, Hammond?
-Yes?

671
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,800
Tell me, what are the...
how does it compare
with the Rimac?

672
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,800
-Nobody's interested.
-Yes, they are. Shut up.

673
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,640
The NIO, it's just, the NIO
is just more of everything.

674
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,960
It's more power,
more grip, more speed.

675
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,640
I have to say, that looked
painfully fast, that car.

676
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,400
It is.
It is astonishingly fast.

677
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,440
But it is a novelty.

678
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,160
An amazing powerfully
fast one, but a novelty
nevertheless.

679
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,360
And we should make it
absolutely clear you can't drive
it on the road at all.

680
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,120
-It's not road legal.
-No, you can't.

681
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,400
The Rimac, you can,
that's what
makes it so amazing.

682
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,920
And there's a new Rimac
coming out soon

683
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,520
that'll have more than
1900 horsepower.

684
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,520
But imagine the size of the
internal combustion engine

685
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,640
you would need
to make 1900 horsepower.

686
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,440
-It would be...
-It'd be massive.

687
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,880
That's why the future
of supercars like that
is electric.

688
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
-It is.
-What?

689
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,080
-It just isn't.
RICHARD AND JAMES: It is.

690
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,480
That's the way it's gonna go.
It's the way it is going.

691
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,920
OK, then, let's find out how
fast your beloved NIO

692
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,040
goes around the Eboladrome.

693
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,880
(WHOOSH)

694
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,520
And it's off to
the sound of the spin cycle.

695
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,920
Jiggling around on its
racing car suspension,

696
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,880
as it powers onto the Isn't.

697
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,200
That's exciting.

698
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,640
A lift and then
building up speed again.

699
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,120
That is looking pretty brisk.

700
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,640
Right, now down into
Your Name Here.

701
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Sparks flashing off
the rear diffuser.

702
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,560
Torque vectoring should be
doing its stuff round here
to keep it in place.

703
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,440
(HIGH-PITCHED WHINE)

704
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,440
And now back to full voltage

705
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,560
for the frantic whirr
back down the Isn't.

706
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,040
Sounding more like
a jet fighter

707
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,800
and less like a Zanussi now.

708
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,440
OK, hard braking
for Old Lady's House.

709
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,160
More milk floaty noises.

710
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,520
And now the run
to Substation.

711
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,120
If it crashes here,
there really will be
a lot of sparks.

712
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,640
OK, two corners left.

713
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,800
Very tidy through there.
Just Field of Sheep to go.

714
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,320
Keeps it neat
and across the line.

715
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,480
RICHARD: That looked good.
JEREMY: She did well there.

716
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,440
-She did do well.
-She did well.

717
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,520
So exciting
with those noises.

718
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,800
-I like the noises.
-What? You can't like
those...

719
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,320
-There's a whole new set
of noises, you pillock.
-(LAUGHTER)

720
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,800
-OK.
-It's the future.

721
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,320
OK, let's see how fast your
elegantly entitled N ten,

722
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,880
-no, NIO...
-NIO.

723
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,280
-...EP9...
-Yes.

724
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,800
...got round, shall we?
Here we go.

725
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,800
JEREMY: Top ten?
RICHARD: Come on.

726
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,840
There you go.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, oh, yes!

727
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,920
-Come on. Come on!
-(AUDIENCE GASPS)

728
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,280
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

729
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,440
That...

730
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,160
That is faster...

731
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,640
faster than
the Aston Martin Vulcan.

732
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,080
You're absolutely right,
Hammond.

733
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
It is a very impressive car.

734
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,760
And it is faster
than a Vulcan.

735
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,600
But it's slower

736
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,280
than the petrol-powered
McLaren Senna,

737
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,760
which is road legal.

738
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,920
-So that is petrol: one...
-Yes.

739
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,680
Electricity: zero!

740
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,000
All right,
don't do that face.

741
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,760
Don't do that face!

742
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,080
-No.
-Smug face.

743
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,280
Not the smug face. I don't...

744
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,920
James,
just move it on, quick.

745
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,160
Yes, in this show
we are explaining
to the people of China

746
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,360
that they don't need to waste
huge sums of money

747
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,280
on new luxury cars when they
could buy something used

748
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,400
from Europe for a lot less.

749
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,840
Now so far,
we've done city driving.

750
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,480
We've done motorway driving.

751
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,080
And we've done a completely
pointless handling test

752
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,800
-that Jeremy devised.
RICHARD: Yep!

753
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,760
And now we had
to get to a rally stage

754
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,960
to take part in another test
that he dreamt up

755
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,440
whilst enjoying another
night on the pneumonia.

756
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,920
(LAUGHTER)

757
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,480
Whatever, OK.
However, listen,

758
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,360
before we left the
test centre where we did
the flamethrower -

759
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,160
the flamethrower
handling test -

760
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,520
we popped next door
to something called the
Zunyi Conference centre.

761
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,400
It was on this very spot,
in 1935,

762
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,200
that Chairman Mao
unveiled the plans

763
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,480
for the future
of his country.

764
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,600
This then is the birthplace
of Communism in China,

765
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,960
and today it stands
as an anti-Capitalist shrine.

766
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,520
Naturally we headed
straight for the gift shop.

767
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,160
-(CASH REGISTER BEEPING)
-Oh, that is exquisite.

768
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,680
Yes, I'll definitely have
a Chairman Mao snow globe.

769
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,480
RICHARD: That one.

770
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,000
-Oh, look.
-(WOMAN GIGGLES)

771
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,080
How much are these?

772
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,400
(CASH REGISTER BEEPS)

773
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,080
So that's 230.

774
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,160
JEREMY: It's Donald Trump.

775
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,760
-I'm absolutely starving.
-Yeah, me too.

776
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,600
-Oh, that's handy.
-That'll do.

777
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,160
Having paid our respects
to Communism...

778
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,360
...we got back on the road
in our fire-damaged cars

779
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,480
with James still moaning
about his temperature issues.

780
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,480
The air conditioning
is now so broken
that it's permanently hot,

781
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,160
even when I turn it to low
and press every auto button.

782
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,480
I decided there was only one
thing I could do about this.

783
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
Ignore him.

784
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,840
Jesus!

785
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,560
Look at that.

786
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,360
They're actually building
another motorway

787
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,960
with viaducts and tunnels

788
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,840
on the other side
of the valley.

789
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,520
You've got one motorway.
Why would you need
another one over there?

790
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,400
Still, all these motorways
did mean we could prove

791
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,760
that our cars work well,
as long-distance cruisers.

792
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,760
If you gloss over
the slightly worn,

793
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,160
interior trim on this car,

794
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,840
I am staggered
at how comfortable it is.

795
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,280
Every inch the Cadillac.

796
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,360
It's fitted with something
called continuously variable
road-sensing suspension.

797
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,200
Or suspension.

798
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,560
And there's more.

799
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,640
In Britain,
this car was described as

800
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,640
astonishingly reliable.

801
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,160
Not my words,
the words of the RAC.

802
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,360
The Royal Automobile Club.

803
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,680
The Queen herself
as good as commended

804
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,560
this car's reliability.

805
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,880
RICHARD: Meanwhile,
in the stuck record.

806
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,200
Lovely engine, silky smooth.

807
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,080
Seats are comfortable,

808
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,040
everything works,
except the air conditioning.

809
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,160
I'm running out of fuel.

810
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,480
There's... That's happened
very suddenly.

811
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,480
Er...This is May, how's
everyone doing for fuel?

812
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,200
I have...about
a quarter of a tank.

813
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,120
I'm gonna need more fuel.
The mighty North Star
has drunk it.

814
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,440
JAMES: Happily,
we soon saw signs
for a service station.

815
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,760
That's excellent. I was just
about to start panicking.

816
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,600
Oh.

817
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,640
Small problem here.

818
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,120
It's not open.

819
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,640
JAMES: So we drove
on to the next one.

820
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,640
Oh, thank God.

821
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,600
Where is it?

822
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,800
Where's the fuel?

823
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,320
Oh, it's not finished.

824
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,640
They could even be fuel tanks
waiting to go in.

825
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,120
JAMES: So, we drove on
to the next one.

826
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,280
Please let this one be open.

827
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,440
But that didn't have
fuel either.

828
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,640
How much money are they
spending on service stations?

829
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,840
Well, a lot, but they're not
earning any from them,
I can tell you that.

830
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,640
The problem China has is it's
building motorways so fast

831
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,680
that the people
building the service stations

832
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,120
to supply the motorway with
fuel...can't keep up.

833
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,400
Chaps, my fumes
are running out now.

834
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,040
After passing two more
unfinished service stations,

835
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,440
we finally got lucky.

836

green for grey.

they did, or it doesn't work,

meaning lightweight, grey.

a bit more upright.
It's quite warm.

1001
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,080
JAMES: I, meanwhile,
had decided to try
my hand at painting.

1002
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,200
Now this is an ideal studio

1003
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,000
because I can paint the
things that I'm going to see
out of the window.

1004
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,720
Sort of montage, if you like,
of typical roadside sights,

1005
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,280
on a chauffeur-journey
through China.

1006
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,760
Trees...

1007
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,560
Trees right here, there.

1011
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,440
Not now, Cato.

1012
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,240
I could be sitting here
now...

1013
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,560
...answering pointless emails
from pointless people

1014
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,840
with nothing better to do
all day.

1015
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,640
Not now, Cato.

1016
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,040
But, no...
I'm doing something useful,

1017
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,880
something joyous,
something pleasurable.

1018
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,400
(TAPPING)

1019
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,280
Not now, Ca... No, Cato,
no, that's inappropriate.

1020
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,320
-(SIZZLING)
-Oh, yeah.

1021
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,840
Oh, yeah.

1022

Watercress.
Bit of that.

1023
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,600
Spend enough time on
the motorway in the back
of your luxury car

1024
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,040
and you could turn yourself
into a part-time
professional chef.

1025
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,680
-We could improv...
-(CLATTERING)

1026

JEREMY:
Meanwhile, in the BMW...

1028
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,600
Cato, my suit.
My suit jacket.

Cato, fire extinguisher.

1030
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,920
Cato, now!

1031
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,920
-(WHOOSH OF
FIRE EXTINGUISHER)
-Thank you. Yeah.

1032
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,160
After a few more
mostly fire-free miles,

1033
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,920
we pulled over
to compare our work.

1034
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,120
May we see, James May,
what you have achieved,

1035
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,000
instead of doing emails?

1036
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,800
Well, it's naive.

1037
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,320
If I were your mum or dad,

1038
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,960
I'd put that
on the fridge door

1039
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,360
and I'd be very proud of you.

1040
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,280
This is going
on the wall at home.

1041
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,560
Can we taste your soup?

1042
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,560
Well,
you'll have to suck my tie.

1043
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,280
That's where it all ended up.

1044
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,240
Were you expanding your mind
by setting yourself on fire?

1045
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,440
-Is that all you've done?
-No, no, no, no, no,
it's matches.

1046
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,080
One snapped
and went into my sleeve.

1047
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,800
JAMES: You've ruined
that beautiful suit.

1048
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,600
-I wanna see
what you've done.
-Let's have a look.

1049
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,840
I'm a bit embarrassed by it.

1050
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,200
Is it... It's a burnt
wreck, isn't it?

1051
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,600
It's not my best work.

1052
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,600
This was gonna be
your birthday present,

1053
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,760
but now you've said it's
crap you're not having it.

1054
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,760
Please don't laugh.

1055
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,400
Oh, right.
And you made that, did you?

1056
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,880
-Really?
-In the back of your car.

1057
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,680
Yeah, I know, but I...
Look... At great cost.

1058
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1059
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,520
JEREMY: For the next leg
of our journey

1060
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,880
we tried out
the modifications
we'd made to our cars,

1061
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:58,040
so they'd suit the world
of modern commerce.

1062
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,480
Businessmen always want
a flat bed when they're on
an aeroplane,

1063
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,920
so why wouldn't you want one
if you're in your car?

1064
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,520
Very simple to achieve this.

1065
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,880
Recline the front seat,

1066
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,720
put a mattress on it,
duvet, pillow.

1067
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,480
Take off what's left of
your jacket and into bed.

1068
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,920
Oh, it's gone dark.
That's nice.

1069
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,400
In the Cadillac, Hammond had
been a little more ambitious.

1070
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,680
Name me one businessman hotel
that doesn't have a gym.

1071
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,080
Exactly.

1072
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,000
They all do, which is why
I've fitted my Cadillac

1073
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,840
with this rowing machine.

1074
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,400
So as we drive along,
I can get in shape.

1075
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,960
Healthy body
means a healthy mind.

1076
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,840
-How's life in your car,
Mr Hammond?
-It's brilliant, thank you.

1077
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,720
-What about you?
-Oh, I'm just nodding off.

1078
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,640
You go in a tunnel, it feels
like night, it's lovely.

1079
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,120
Um... Question, though.
What's... What's James done?

1080
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,560
I can't see him.

1081
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,680

1083
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,720
I realise this now
looks like an idiotic idea.

1084
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,880
It was already
a sauna in my car,

1085
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,640
so I've built a sauna in it.

1086
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,400
But...let's imagine you were
in the far north of China.

1087
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,200
Let's imagine
it's the winter.

from the other side,

1093
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,680
There was, however, one small
drawback to my plan.

1094

couldn't see his mirrors.

need saunas, gyms and beds,

we sacked our chauffeurs

Leaving the multilingual
Brummie to deal with the
Chinese breakdown services,

1136
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,960
James and I got back onto
what is fast becoming...

1137
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,920
...the eighth wonder
of the world:

1138
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,240
China's road network.

1139
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,040
In 1988, China had
no motorways at all.

1140
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:20,800
And now, 30 years later,
it has 84,000 miles of them.

1141
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,160
That's more than any other
country in the world.

1142
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,480
And they're only just
getting into their stride.

1143
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:42,800
Since 2011, they've been
building 6,000 miles of
motorway every year.

1144
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,000
6,000 miles a year!

1145
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,720
It beggars belief and it's
not like the terrain is easy.

1146
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,520
Here, though, there ain't
no mountain high enough

1147
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,240
and there ain't no valley
low enough, to stop them.

1148
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,040
This bridge, for example...

1149
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,960
...is 34 miles long.

1150
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:16,400
And then there's this one,
the Duge Beipanjiang Bridge.

1151
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,520
You could fit the London
Shard underneath it...

1152
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,240
...twice over.

1153
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,080
I'm telling you.

1154
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,160
In Britain, we're doomed.

1155
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,720
We're doomed.

1156
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,720
We were headed, though,
for an old road,

1157
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,080
to test the one thing
we hadn't tested so far.

1158
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,920
And here in China, it's
the most important thing.

1159
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,360
The thing is, luxury's all
very well, but in China,

1160
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,960
driving is
a relatively new thing.

1161
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,520
People have only been
doing it for 30 years.

1162
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:03,040
And as is the way with all
new things, it should be fun.

1163
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,760
Eventually we...

1164
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,400
Well, two of us, arrived at
the location we'd selected.

1165
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,200
It's known as
the 24-curve road

1166
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:25,320
because it has
24 fun-filled curves.

1167
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:30,280
It was built in 1935 to ferry
US military equipment
to China.

1168
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,480
And it hasn't really
been maintained since.

1169
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,560
So the surface is
loose and potholed.

1170
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,240
And it looked like
it should be a right laugh.

1171
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,360
This was actually part
of the road that led...

1172
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,160
the only road that linked the
then capital of China with
India and Burma.

1173
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,000
Yeah, well, before that,
all the supplies

1174
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,000
that came into China
had to be flown over
the Himalayas,

1175
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,040
which was incredibly
dangerous in the '30s.

1176
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,240
I think the Americans
lost something like 400--

1177
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,720
Sorry... Sorry to interrupt,

1178
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,600
have you seen
this stupid thing?

1179
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,240
Well, never mind that,
look what he's driving.

1180
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,880
What, is that Hammond?

1181
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,240
-I guess the Cadillac's
definitely broken, then.
-(JEREMY LAUGHS)

1182
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,880
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

1183
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,240
Nice!

1184
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,480
-Check out my Fulu.
-Why have you got that?

1185
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,600
Well I wasn't gonna let you
have all the fun, was I?

1186
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,640
Never mind that,
why have you got it?

1187
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,120
My telephone translation
device at the toll booth
worked to a degree,

1188
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,600
to this extent.

1189
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,480
What you...
Somebody got you a car?

1190
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,040
Look, I got wheels,
three of them.

1191
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:35,720
-What engine's it got?
-588cc twin-cylinder
two-stroke.

1192
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,040
-(JEREMY INHALES)
-It's in the back.

1193
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,880
Ah, look at that.

1194
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,320
It's actually smaller
than its own air filter.

1195
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,560
I was gonna say, my
alternator's bigger than
that in the Mercedes.

1196
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,600
Anyway, listen.
Here's what we're doing.

1197
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,360
-Yeah.
-It's a test of speed.

1198
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,040
Cos we are against the clock,
bear that in mind, OK?

1199
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,960
And durability,
at the same time.

1200
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
So you've gotta get
up this road,

1201
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,840
which goes all
the way up there,

1202
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,440
as fast as possible,

1203
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,440
and keep your car
in one piece in the process.

1204
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,240
Richard and I decided
that James

1205
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,200
should volunteer to go first.

1206
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,240
Oh.

1207
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,120
Oh, you look exactly
like a racing driver,
apart from visually.

1208
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,000
It's a racing clown.

1209
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,600
Can we just get on with it?
It's very hot in here.

1210
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,280
Going with your window
down or up? Lot of stones.

1211
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,560
Down?

1212
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,400
It's a small risk
from being hit by a stone.

1213
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,880
It's a large risk of
dying from suffocation.

1214
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,360
Right. Anything else
we wanna say to him?

1215
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,880
Yes. "Go."

1216
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,360
Just take some time
and prepare mentally,

1217
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,240
and really think about this.

1218
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,160
-Have you visualised
the course?
-No.

1219
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,680
RICHARD: OK.

1220
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,960
JEREMY: He looks quite cross.
RICHARD: He does, yeah.

1221
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
-Three, two, one, go!
-There you go.

1222
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,480
Push.

1223
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,520
Oh ,God, I can't...

1224
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,360
I can't see round
right-hand bends because
of my sauna.

1225
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,560
Whoa!

1226
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,920
Massive hole there.

1227
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,640
I've just realised that
I've only been comfortable

1228
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,040
for 20 minutes
of this entire trip.

1229
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,040
My car's been too hot,
my suit's too hot,

1230
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,840
now the road's too rough.

1231
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,720
Bit of squirrelling there
from the broken traction
control.

1232
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,160
The finish line!

1233
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,280
I've done it!

1234
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,480
JEREMY: Next, it was my turn.

1235
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,320
Right, I'm attaching the
wobbly-headed symbol
of Capitalism here,

1236
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,880
to bring me good fortune
on this perilous test.

1237
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,000
-If you're ready.
-Yes.

1238
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,960
Five, four, three...
(LAUGHS)

1239
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,160
...two, one.

1240
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,880
Go!

1241
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,360
Now, I'm guessing James May
will have gone for caution.

1242
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,120
I'm not going to.

1243
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,440
Cos I'm going
for speed and power.

1244
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,040
And then just trust
in the BMW build quality.

1245
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,000
My wobbly-headed symbol
of Capitalism is wilting.

1246
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,240
It's not... Arrrgh!

1247
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,880
Jesus, that was
a big tail slide there!

1248
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,520
Oh, yeah.

1249
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,600
Stick it in here. Oh, yes.

1250
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,520
-(RATTLING)
-Oh, what's happened?

1251
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,840
(RATTLING AND CLANKING)

1252
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,240
Yeah.

1253
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,720
-You overdid it, didn't you?
-Yeah.

1254
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,240
JAMES: So I've won that.

1255
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,280
Well, we don't know.
We haven't got your time yet.

1256
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,400
You said - your words: "Test
of durability and is against
the clock."

1257
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,440
Your car is broken.

1258
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,920
-It's not broken,
a tyre's come off.
-It's broken.

1259
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,800
RICHARD:
Down at the start line,

1260
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,720
I was waiting
for the signal to go.

1261
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,240
Hm. Little cubby hole.

1262
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,000
JEREMY: Richard Hammond.

1263
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,800
Hello, yes.

1264
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,240
JEREMY: Three, two, one, go!
-Oh, come on, I'm not...

1265
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,080
Right, OK, here I go.

1266
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,680
(ENGINE REVS)

1267
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,280
And we're off.

1268
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,040
Oh, Christ! Oh.

1269
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,520
I am limited on power.

1270
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,520
Top speed: 39 miles an hour.

1271
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,840
Ow, ow!

1272
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,600
We're never gonna get an air
ambulance in here, are we?

1273
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,560
Well, he might
have a very long winch.

1274
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,840
Ohhh!

1275
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,680
Big drops, I don't like that.
Ow!

1276
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,080
Nervous of hill
climbs these days.

1277
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,560
Agh, oh.

1278
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,640
A line, use my line.

1279
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,320
Ow.

1280
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,480
Oh, my God!

1281
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,080
Oh, dear!

1282
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,800
Oh, God!

1283
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,960
-Did anyone s...
-Was that...

1284
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,760
-Did he just crash it?
-Was that a crash or did he
just disappear behind the...

1285
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,720
He has, look,
he's gone off there.

1286
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,400
Er...so there we are,

1287
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:36,880
I'm afraid that
Richard Hammond's luck
has finally run out.

1288
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,720
And it's with deep regret,
and great sadness,

1289
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:43,600
that James and I
must now announce
the untimely demise of...

1290
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,560
RICHARD: I'm all right.

1291
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,360
-Not again.
-How's he do it?

1292
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,400
I don't know.

1293
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,040
Well, on that terrible
disappointment,

1294
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,760
back to the tent.

1295
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,760
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1296
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,600
-Look at my face.
-I'm OK. I'm OK.

1297
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,040
JEREMY: Smug face.
-I'm fine.

1298
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,440
-Don't worry.
-Smug.

1299
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,080
Smug because I won that.

1300
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,800
-No, you didn't.
-I did, I was the fastest.

1301
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:18,560
And it was supposed to be a
test of fun and you moaned
the entire way up the hill.

1302
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,160
It was a test of durability.
You had to change a wheel
and where's the fun in that?

1303
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,920
Well, I wasn't the idiot that
put a sauna in my car.

1304
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,360
What's wrong with a sauna?

1305
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,800
Because in every hotel
that's got a sauna,

1306
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,760
the corridors are
always full of wet idiots

1307
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,640
with those slippers
that don't fit.

1308
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,560
-Hello? Hello?
-What?

1309
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,000
I did have quite a big crash
at the end there. I thought--

1310
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,800
There's nothing particularly
remarkable about that,
is there?

1311
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,040
I mean, why would you...

1312
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,000
The fact is,
the reason you crashed...

1313
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,000
Well, obviously
you're incompetent.

1314
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:51,680
But also because your
Cadillac broke down and
your Mercedes was too humid.

1315
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,720
So that means
the winner is definitely,
of the whole thing,

1316
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,440
the BMW 750i.

1317
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,360
-What?
-Actually, no.

1318
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,800
To be fair, the real winner
of the whole thing was
our brilliant idea

1319
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,720
to sell second-hand limos
to the Chinese.

1320
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,280
No, he's absolutely right
about that,

1321
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,960
because it makes them happy

1322
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,120
and it helps us with
our balance of payments.

1323
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,160
-Everybody wins.
-It was a good idea.

1324
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,200
-Yes.
-Except for one tiny detail.

1325
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:20,280
You see, this programme
is shown in every single
country in the world.

1326
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,800
Except one.

1327
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,400
(LAUGHTER)

1328
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,080
-Which one?
-China.

1329
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,680
Ah.

1330
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,080
So this entire show has been
a total waste of time.

1331
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,200
It's an hour of your life
you'll never get back.

1332
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,320
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it's time to end.

1333
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,040
Next week, I'm happy to say,
we're back in the groove.

1334
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,400
We're in Scotland and I get
an Alfa Romeo GTV6,
make me very happy.

1335
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,320
See you then, take care.
Good night.

1336
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,280
-Good night.
