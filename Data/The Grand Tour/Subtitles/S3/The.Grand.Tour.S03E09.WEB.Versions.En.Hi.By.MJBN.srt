about this colour.

is stunning.

Top speed, 195.

39
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,180
But here's the thing.

40
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,820
Astons have always been
beautiful and fast

41
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,420
in a straight line,

42
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,140
but when you're
making a sports car,

43
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,180
that's the easy part.

44
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,900
It was when you dug
deeper under the skin,

45
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,940
into the areas
you couldn't see,

46
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,580
that in the past
they often came up short.

47
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,860
The trouble is, the company
has never had the money

48
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,740
or the manpower
of Porsche or Ferrari,

49
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,060
and you could sense that
in their cars.

50
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,100
They just didn't feel
as well made

51
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
or well-engineered
as some rivals.

52
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,820
That means
they sold mainly to people

53
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,460
listening to their hearts
and not their heads,

54
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,460
because your heart says,
"I want an Aston"

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
even when your head says,

56
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,460
"That door doesn't fit
properly."

57
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,860
But this is 2018.

58
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,900
Good looks and speed aren't
enough if bits are coming off
in your hand.

59
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,580
This car can't be nice
to drive, "for an Aston".

60
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,100
It can't be well made,
"for an Aston".

61

It's got to be good,
full stop.

62
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,740
So, let's start
with the interior,

63
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,100
a place that normally
tells you straightaway

64
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,660
if corners have been cut.

65
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,660
And the news in here is good.

66
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,740
Everything you see
is brand new,

67
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,660
not warmed-up leftovers
from an older model.

68
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,540
And it all feels
properly put together...

69
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,340
as it should in a car
that costs £121,000.

70
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,140
And if you push down on
the electric height adjustor,

71
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,020
it has the lowest
driving position

72
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,260
of any car I've ever been in.

73
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,820
I mean, I wouldn't claim
to be a tall man, but...

74
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
...this is low.

75
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,540
I feel seven.

76
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
Then we come to the engine.

77
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,380
It's a four-litre V8.

78
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,500
It has twin turbos.

79
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,740
It makes 510 horsepower,
and...

80
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,580
...it's German.

81
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,380
Specifically from the AMG
division of Mercedes.

82
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,420
Yes, this will make people
of a Brexity persuasion
choke on their real ale,

83
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,460
but look at it this way.

84

a brilliant one?

here that says, look,

88
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,180
it's been inspected by
somebody at Aston Martin.

89
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,500

slapdash German engineers

90
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,460
have done things properly.

91
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,220
But although the Vantage
has Mercedes lungs,

92
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,180
the engineers
have tried to make sure

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,140
it sings with an Aston voice.

doesn't make this noise.

it's all oom-pah bass.

have added

to the acid test -

104
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,780
how the new Vantage
handles corners.

105
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,660

things seem promising.

Of course, it's still a car
from a small British company,

an Aston and love it,

that a 911 was a better car.

that gap has been closed

it doesn't matter.

Amazing, I know.

I agree with you, it is
a brilliant, brilliant car.

155
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,020
But one thing
I ought to mention -

156
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,900
you know all that tech
inside it?

157
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,300
That is Mercedes stuff,

158
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,460
but it's last-generation
Mercedes stuff
they're fitting.

159
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,100
But it's still better
than all the stuff
that Aston used to fit.

160
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,140
That's true.
No, that is true.

161
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,660
And the other thing, you
expressed surprise that
it's got that AMG engine.

162
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,060
But remember, the Aston V12,
they've been using for years,
that's German.

163
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,860
-It's made in Germany.
-Yes.

164
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,740
That makes it sort of German,
doesn't it?

165
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,900
No, no, no. It's where it's
designed and developed
that matters.

166
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,020
-No, he has got a point.
-Yeah, I mean...

167
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,740
your autobiography, you could
get it printed in Germany

168
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,460
but it would still be dreary
because you designed
and conceived it.

169
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,620
It's...

170
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Can't argue with that, May,
it would be.

with what's German,
and what's not.

The point is, OK,
unlike the previous Vantage,

173
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,620
that is way, way more
than a pretty face.

174
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,900
I mean, a lot more.

175
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,260
But, now, let's find how fast

176
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,060
Abbie can get one
around the Eboladrome.

177
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,220
(ENGINE REVS)

178
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,620
JEREMY: And away it goes,

179
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,020
with a little bit
of wheel spin

180
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,220
and a wiggle of the hips
under power,

181
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,980
but Abbie's got it
under control,

182
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,540
hammering onto the Isn't.

183
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,980
Working away there at that
unusual and frankly stupid

184
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,700
square steering wheel.

185
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,420
And already we're at the drop
down into Your Name Here.

186
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,220
Was that a four-wheel drift?

187
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,940
And another one!

188
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,540
And now hard braking...

189
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
Ooh, look at that,
turns in well.

190
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,460
And that looks quick.

191
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,740
Seems a bit lively there as
all that turbocharged torque

192
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,300
tries to kick the tail out.

193
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,460
If this run was at night,
she'd be in trouble

194
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,100
because the Vantage's
headlamps are woeful!

195
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,580
But no complaints about
the speed, that's for sure.

196
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,980
OK. Oh, coming in wide
for Old Lady's House.

197
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,780
But keeping it neat
round there,

198
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,020
and now the short squirt
down to Substation.

199
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,460
Floaty under braking.
Flicks it in.

200
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Just Field of Sheep to go.

201
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,100
Surprisingly un-slidy
and across the line!

202
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,140
-Oh, there we go.
-Looks exciting.

203
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,180
-It does.
-That was lively.

204
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,900
Like an old-fashioned
racing car, moving around.

205
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,540
-The old days.
-That was a good-looking lap,
that.

206
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,020
Let's find out where
it ended up on our lap board.

207
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,460
Shall we? Here we go.

208
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,540
Aye, aye...ooh.

209
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,460
Exactly the same speed
as a 911 GT3 RS.

210
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,820
When you think the Aston
doesn't have a massive wing

211
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,780
and scaffolding in the back,
that is pretty impressive.

212
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,860
-It is very impressive.
-But never mind that.

213
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,540
It's no faster
than a BMW M5.

214
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,060
Yes, but I think
what that says, James,

215
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,340
is the M5 is
seriously quick.

216
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,740
-Well, quite.
-Yeah, yeah.

217
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,740
You do forget
just how fast that thing is.

218
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,380
It is, it certainly is.

219
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,660
But now it is time to buy
a four-pack of chat...

220
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,420
(LAUGHTER)

221
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,420
...from the off-licence
of debate.

222
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,500
(GROANS)

223
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,100
...on Conversation Street!

224
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,980
(MELLOW JAZZ)

225
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,420
(LAUGHTER)

226
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,740
-I remember that one.
-I remember that one.

227
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,100
-I enjoyed that one a lot.
-(LAUGHS)

228
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,460
Anyway, Volkswagen.
They've come up with a new,
a one-off, racing car.

229
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,380
All electric, uh...
all-wheel drive.

230
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,220
It's called the IDR, I've
got a picture of it here.

231
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,220
Now, what interests me
about it is that

232
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,620
there's a claim
that it generates
so much cornering force,

233
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,460
it can cause the driver
to black out.

234
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,660
Is... Is that a good idea?

235
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,980
A car that renders
its driver unconscious?

236
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,260
I just don't believe it.

237
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,380
I know Kimi Raikkonen
goes unconscious,

238
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,540
but that's normally after
the race in the hotel bar.

239
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,700
Yeah, that doesn't count.

240
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,220
That is Kimi's problem.

241
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,820
The other problem
with that is,

242
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,380
it's not lateral G that makes
you go unconscious, is it?

243
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,660
That's G from side to side,
that's not really the issue.

244
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,540
Lateral G
is what you get in a car

245
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,780
and it's where the blood
goes from side to side.

246
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
It's only got that...
And I'm wide,
but it only goes that far.

247
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,860
So in your head you've got
one bit a bit drowsy
and black-outy,

248
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,180
but the other side of your head,
when going round a corner,

249
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,220
is really alert
cos it's full of blood.

250
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,500
No, it's more interesting -
different sides of your head
do different things.

251
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,460
Go that way, and you'd be:
"I want to be really precise,
and do science,"

252
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,260
go this way,
you'd be all creative:

253
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,700
"I just want to paint..."
Algebra...
"I just want to sing."

254
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,340
(LAUGHTER)

255
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,260
When motor racing
commentators talk about,

256
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,020
"That car's got 5G going
through that corner,"

257
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,820
you think,
"But it's five lateral G."

258
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,420
-Yes, exactly.
-It's not the same 5G
you get in a fighter plane

259
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,660
when the blood's going
effectively from
the top of your head

260
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,220
down to the bottom
of your feet, which is
a very long way,

261
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,700
so your head empties and
that's when you do black out.

262
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,020
JAMES: Yes, exactly.

263
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,300
And it used to be alleged
that Douglas Bader

264
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,340
could pull tighter turns
in his Hurricane

265
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,020
than other pilots because
he didn't have any legs

266
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,540
so the blood couldn't go into
them, it stayed in his body.

267
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,180
-I didn't know that.
-Apparently so.

268
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,540
Didn't that mean
he'd just get a big stiffy?

269
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,020
-Well...
-(LAUGHTER)

270
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,500
Because all his, all this...

271
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,980
It's science,
that is medical science!

272
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,380
JAMES: He's right.

273
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,380
-All his blood went there.
-It did.

274
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,020
He was known during
the Battle of Britain
as Douglas Boner.

275
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,460
(LAUGHTER)

276
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,700
"My joystick's broke!
Oh, I've got the wrong one."

277
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,980
"Ooh, I love a dogfight,
a nice..."

278
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,860
We... We can move on.

279
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,380
Now, you might be wondering
why we haven't featured

280
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,460
the Rolls-Royce Cullinan,
their new sort of super
luxury SUV, on this series.

281
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,420
And that's because
Rolls-Royce did express

282
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,740
some reservations
about lending us one

283
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,900
because they said
they were worried
we might say it was ugly.

284
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,060
-Why would they think that?
-Because they've seen it?

285
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,700
(LAUGHTER)

286
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,340
We've actually got a picture
of the Cullinan here.
There it is.

287
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,820
JAMES: Yeah.
RICHARD: (GAGS) Oh, sorry.

288
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,540
JEREMY:
It's a very interesting car.

289
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,820
And I don't doubt
that it's exquisite
to drive and to sit in.

290
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,860
But it is disgusting
to look at, isn't it?

291
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,140
-That's the main thing.
-I've been thinking about
this, OK?

292
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,940
You might want to drive one,
or own one.

293
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,500
But you're gonna have to
come out of your house

294
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,260
and walk up to it
and see it.

295
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,700
So I was wondering, could you
dig a tunnel, if you had one,

296
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,820
from your cellar, and then
that emerges underneath it?

297
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,260
-Then you wouldn't have to
look at it.
-Exactly.

298
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,060
You'd have to cut a hole
in the bottom of your
Rolls-Royce to get in

299
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,300
and nobody's gonna do that.

300
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,540
What if you fitted
the Cullinan with...

301
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,460
you know that magic glass
that is clear when you look
through it at right angles,

302
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,420
but if you look through it
at any other angle,

303
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,260
it's sort of frosted
so you can't...

304
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,980
-That won't work.
-How do you know?

305
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,820
Because I've got that - and
I genuinely have got that -

306
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,820
in the bathroom
in my flat in London.

307
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,740
-Right.
-Now, for six years I've been
taking showers by the window.

308
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,540
(LAUGHTER)

309
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,540
Cleaning my gentleman's area
very thoroughly,

310
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,420
and sometimes quite quickly.

311
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,620
And...

312
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,220
I'm actually
not making this up.

313
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
The floor is six storeys
down, the pavement.

314
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,060
You go,
"Well, I can't see that,

315
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,300
so nobody down there
can see me."

316
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,780
But a friend,
the other day, said

317
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,860
"You know you can be
seen from the street?"

318
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,780
-Oh, my God!
-Seriously.

319
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,220
-But you can't see out
when you're in the shower?
-No, I said.

320
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,260
-Well, the builder put the
glass in the wrong way round.
-Must have done.

321
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,420
I think that builder
saw you coming.

322
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,940
(LAUGHS)

323
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,620
(APPLAUSE)

324
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,300
-I think the only answer
for Rolls-Royce...
-Hold on.

325
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,340
I just heard...
Is there a phone in there?

326
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,100
No, you had a stroke.
Again.

327
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,100
I'm sure I heard a phone.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

328
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,220
WOMAN: My school alarm,
I'm sorry.
-Was it you?

329
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,420
-My school alarm,
I'm sorry.
-Your what alarm?

330
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,820
My school alarm to pick
my kids up from school.

331
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,540
Oh, well, that...
Now you're a terrible parent!

332
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,300
(LAUGHTER)

333
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,220
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
the art of great parenting,
right there!

334
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,980
I'm gonna call the NSPCC
on you.

335
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,540
How old are your children?

336
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,340
-Oh, 11...
-Oh, for God's sake!

337
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,340
She still hasn't moved.

338
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,100
-Oh, they'll be fine.
-11, nine, eight and three.

339
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,460
-I wasn't that interested.
-(LAUGHTER)

340
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,580
We've established
they're not in their 30s,
is what I was trying to say.

341
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,060
-Meanwhile...
-Yes.

342
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,180
I don't think that
that one-way glass

343
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,980
that isn't one-way
is gonna work.

344
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,940
I think really Rolls-Royce's
only hope with that new car

345
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,060
is they're gonna have
to hope they can find

346
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,420
a lot of very rich people
with absolutely no taste.

347
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,340
-That's their only chance.
-Where are they gonna find
people like that, I wonder?

348
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,980
-Well, there's Cheshire.
-Yeah.

349
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,020
-Dubai.
-Solihull, Monaco, Moscow.

350
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,100
Beverly Hills.
They're gonna sell millions
of the things.

351
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,940
Yeah, they are.

352
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,100
Massive hit.

353
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Now, there's a man
in Nottingham.

354
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,660
He's building a house
and he's told the planners that
outside,

355
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,900
the big empty area,
is actually

356
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,660
a landing pad for
a self-driving
electric flying car.

357
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,340
Hm, yeah, that sounds like
what he's built is
a helicopter landing pad.

358
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,940
Yes, it does,
it does sound very like that.

359
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,780
Unless he's planning
to land there in this,

360
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,340
the new Aston Martin
flying car.

361
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,820
Looks very cool.

362
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,500
No, Hammond,
that's not a flying car,
that's just a drawing

363
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,660
of something that'll
never happen. It won't.

364
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,580
But somebody has actually
made a real flying car
and I've got a picture.

365
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,900
JEREMY: That's practical!
JAMES: Pretty dreary
actually, isn't it?

366
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,780
JEREMY: You can't drive
that on the road.

367
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,580
If you took it into town
and someone dinged
the folded-away wing,

368
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,340
you couldn't fly it then.

369
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,060
-Nobody flies
in a bent aeroplane.
-No, exactly.

370
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,100
And when are people gonna
get it into their heads that
a flying car is an aeroplane?

371
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,900
Because, if your car flies,
why the bloody hell would
you drive anywhere?

372
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,580
I mean, it just doesn't
make sense.

373
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,300
Or worse,
you're driving that,

374
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,180
not feeling at all
self-conscious
around the M25,

375
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,660
you hear there's a bit
of a traffic jam ahead,

376
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,580
so you think,
"I'll lower the wings, build
up to a take-off speed

377
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,100
of, what, 120, 150."

378
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,580
The police will go, "What the
bloody hell are you doing?"

379
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,340
They're gonna have a word.
You'd need to get a pilot's
licence to operate that.

380
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,940
-That takes months.
-And then you'd have to learn
that gobbledegook you two...

381
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,500
No, you'd have to learn to
communicate in the air--

382
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,780
Yes, but you two don't talk
English when you get up
in there.

383
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,780
There's a language so
you can pass information
quickly and clearly.

384
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,020
Yes, but why do you got
your own alphabet for?

385
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,260
"Did you come
through the alpha vector

386
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,100
on the three approach
to four LH?

387
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,420
Oh, I had to get on the tower
and say I was--"

388
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,580
It's about controlled
airspace!

389
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,020
"I was Mug Paper
Picture Oscar."

390
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,420
Why do you have to have
a word for a letter?

391
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,940
So that you know what the
letter is - a P and a B on a
crackly radio sound the same.

392
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,060
Is that why you call him
a bunt all the time?

393
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,780
JAMES AND RICHARD: Yes.

394
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,260
That's exactly why,
so that it's clear.

395
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,340
Now, there is a new report
which says the Scottish

396
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,940
are the best drivers
in the world.

397
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,660
If you think about it,
they've got Jim Clark,
Jackie Stewart,

398
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,580
David Coulthard, Franchitti,
Allan McNish... What?

399
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,260
No, not best in that way,
they mean the safest drivers
in the world.

400
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,820
-That's what they mean.
-The safest drivers aren't
the best drivers.

401
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,060
-Well, they sort of are.
-No, they aren't.

402
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,940
If that were true,
if you think about it,

403
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,100
I would be a better driver
than Jackie Stewart

404
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,020
because I've had
fewer crashes.

405
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,940
-But I'm not better, am I?
-No, you're emphatically not.

406
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,820
-Exactly.
-What they're saying is...

407
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,540
Actually, 51 per cent
of Scottish drivers

408
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,500
have never been
in an accident.

409
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,580
-51 per cent.
-That's not that good though.

410
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,900
That means 49 per cent of
Scottish people have been

411
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,820
in an accident.
That's nearly half of them.

412
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,260
-Well--
-No, but it's "never" is the
big word, though, isn't it?

413
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,100
I mean, never... Who here's
never had an accident?

414
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,500
Never? But how long
have you been driving?

415
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,540
Um...one month.

416
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,580
-(LAUGHTER)
RICHARD: Well done!

417
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,980
-She's doing well.
-Well, there you go.

418
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,340
RICHARD: Keep it up.

419
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,020
Keep going.

420
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,260
-That's better than you did.
-That's quite a record.

421
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,700
(LAUGHTER)

422
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,580
I did 36 hours before

423
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,700
I was off the road with
no wheels on my car.

424
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,700
Er...we'll drop that.

425
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,740
That hasn't worked out
quite as well as I'd hoped.

426
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,060
That is the end of
Conversation Street.

427
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,420
RICHARD: Yes
-Thank you very much.

428
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,500
Lovely, lovely.

429
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,580
Now, this year marks
the 50th anniversary

430
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,820
of the first landings
on the Moon,

431
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,740
and I thought I should
take a little celebratory
look back

432
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,220
at that truly
historic mission.

433
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,660
James, this isn't
a grand tour of
whatever is in your head.

434
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,820
-You do know that?
-No, but I promise

435
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,460
there will be
some cars in this film.

436
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,900
Eventually.

437
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,700
I believe that this nation
should commit itself

438
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,580
to achieving the goal
before this decade is out

439
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,620
of landing a man on the Moon

440
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,180
and returning him
safely to the Earth.

441
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,820
JAMES: When President Kennedy
made that speech to Congress

442
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,740
in 1961,

443
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,700
he gave the scientists at
NASA a planet-sized headache.

444
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,180
Let me try and put the size
of that headache into
some sort of perspective.

445
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,820
When Kennedy
said those words,

446
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,860
America's total experience
in space amounted to

447
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,020
just one 15-minute
suborbital flight

448
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,500
that reached an altitude
of just 116 miles
above the Earth.

449
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:55,100
By contrast, a journey to
the Moon was 238,000 miles,

450
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,020
and no rocket existed
that was powerful enough
to get the astronauts there.

451
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,500
And even if they did
reach their destination,

452
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,100
there was then
the immense challenge
of getting them home again.

453
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,860
Let's imagine this basketball
I'm holding is the Earth,

454
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,620
in which case the Moon
can be represented by
a baseball 23 feet away.

455
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,100
There it is over there.

456
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,420
All the space exploration
that had taken part so far,

457
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,340
so all the Mercury capsules,
all the Soviet stuff,

458
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,660
that happened about there.

459
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,100
Now, the thickness
of this piece of paper

460
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,820
represents the corridor
that the astronauts
would have to fly along

461
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,380
to get home safely.

462
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,820
Now, to do that, obviously
you'd want some sort of
guidance computer on board.

463
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,740
Problem is, the computers
of the time were so huge
and so primitive,

464
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,100
they lived
in their own buildings.

465
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,220
And the President wanted all
this done within the decade.

466
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,740
People thought he was mad.

467
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,740
Nevertheless, the brains
at NASA knuckled down,

468
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,460
and throughout the 1960s
set about developing

469
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,700
and testing the rockets and
the technology that would be

470
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,860
needed to crack
this monumental nut.

471
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,820
However, machinery on
its own was not enough.

472
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,060
Equally important
to the success of
the space programme

473
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,700
were the astronauts.

474
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,980
Now, these men
were generally of a type.

475
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,060
They were fighter jocks
and test pilots,

476
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,540
and they were very
familiar with moving around
at very high speed.

477
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,380
So, and I did promise we'd
get some cars into this,

478
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,420
when it came to moving around
on the face of the Earth,

479
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,180
there was one car they
favoured above all others.

481
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,580
The Corvette -

482
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,940
America's "premier"
sports car.

483
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,340
The big love-in between
the American astronauts
and the Corvette

484
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,100
started with Alan Shepard...

485
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,300
...the first American
in space in 1961.

486
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,340
And on his safe
return to Earth,

487
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,740
he was given a free Corvette
by General Motors,

488
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,220
a sort of medal
for services to the country.

489
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,780
(MILITARY MARCH PLAYS)

490
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,700
However, even though
Shepard was deemed worthy

491
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,460
of a tickertape
hero's welcome
by the American public,

492
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,540
NASA saw astronauts like him
as government employees,

493
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,860
and as such,
unable to accept free gifts.

494
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,380
So, an enterprising Corvette
dealer near the Cape Kennedy
Space Center in Florida

495
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,340
came up with a cunning idea.

496
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,660
He offered the astronauts
a special deal

497
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,900
whereby they could lease
a Corvette for the enormous
sum of...one dollar.

498
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,660
Now, NASA couldn't

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,220
Technically the cars
weren't free,
they were being paid for.

500
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,380
So all the astronauts
bit his hand off.

501
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,260
Gus Grissom, the second
American in space, had one.

502
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,060
So did Gordon Cooper,
a man so cool

503
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,260
he actually fell asleep
on the launch pad

504
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,300
while waiting for lift-off.

505
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,820
Jim Lovell,
the hero of the ill-fated

506
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,140
"Houston, we've had a
problem" Apollo 13 mission -

507
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,460
he too was a Corvette man.

508
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,740
Basically,
in the '60s and '70s,

509
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,100
Cape Kennedy
and the surrounding roads

510
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,780
were awash with spacemen
driving one-dollar Corvettes.

511
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,340
But it was the holy trinity
of Shepard, Cooper
and Grissom

512
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,500
who were
the real petrolheads.

513
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,020
The good news for them
was that the Space Center
here at Kennedy

514
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,340
was criss-crossed with
lovely wide, straight roads

515
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,060
which NASA engineers
used to move stuff about -

516
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,060
i.e. rockets.

517
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,660
But that meant, as far as
those three were concerned,

518
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,220
that they were in heaven.

519
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,700
They'd come to places
like this after work

520
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,140
and just drag race
the hell out of their cars,

521
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,740
and then they'd
have them modified,

522
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,100
and then they'd drag race
them a bit more.

523
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,580
Gordo Cooper allegedly
had his car modified
up to 180 miles an hour,

524
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,980
and he and Gus Grissom
even used to go and pit crew

525
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,420
for a racing team
if they had a weekend off.

526
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,380
They liked cars.

527
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,300
Then there was astronaut
John Glenn,

528
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,900
the first American
to orbit the Earth,

529
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,180
and as a test pilot,
the first man

530
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:28,940
to cross
the American continent
at supersonic speeds.

531
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,180
Clearly,
this was a man comfortable
with putting his foot down.

532
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,140
However, the car he drove

533
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,980
was not quite as sporty
as a Corvette.

534
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,140
Yes, John Glenn, holder of
supersonic flight records

535
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,620
and the first American to
orbit the Earth, drove this.

536
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,940
It's called a Prinz.

537
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,420
It's made by the long-dead
German car maker NSU,

538
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,740
and it's a microscopic
economy car.

539
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,420
It has an engine of just
under 600cc, two cylinders.

But Glenn wasn't worried
about the sedate pace.

544
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,140
He lived out in the sticks,

545
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,220
he had a long commute
to Cape Kennedy,

546
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,740
and he wanted a car that
gave him good gas mileage.

552
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,540
I've read accounts by the
astronauts of what the rocket
launches were actually like -

553
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,740
a lot of noise, a lot of
clattering, a lot of banging.

554
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,020
Well, John Glenn was ready.

555
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,100
By 1969, just inside
Kennedy's deadline,

556
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,540
NASA was ready to try landing
some men on the Moon.

557
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,340
The astronauts chosen
were Buzz Aldrin,

558
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,980
who drove a Corvette,

559
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,340
Neil Armstrong,
who drove a Corvette,

560
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,060
and Mike Collins,
who drove a Beetle.

561
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,300
Presumably that's
why they left him
in the command module

562
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,780
and didn't let him walk
on the lunar surface.

563
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,980
The rocket that would take
them there, the Saturn V,

564
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,820
was, and remains, the most
complex machine ever built.

565
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,540
It was constructed of
three million components,

566
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,100

the astronauts, used to joke,

568
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,580

seven-and-a-half million
pounds of thrust.

577
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,180

minutes after launch,

00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,460
nearly all of it was gone...

00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,540
And he had his polo shirt
tucked into his chinos.

669
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,980
Your point
about the polo shirt is?

670
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,860
My point is very simple, OK?

671
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,980
You look at pictures
from the space station.

672
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,780
I follow it on Instagram.
Look at this.

673
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:58,180
I mean, I'm sorry, they look
like people who run
a port-a-loo rental company.

674
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,380
If you go for an audition
with NASA, yeah,

675
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,140
and you don't arrive in
the car park in your Corvette

676
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,860
on full opposite lock,
you don't get the job.

677
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,060
They should get the maths
out of the space programme

678
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,940
and replace it
with some flamboyance.

679
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,140
You probably need
a little bit of maths.

680
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,420
No, you don't, you just want
them to be funny.

681
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,580
No, that's children's
entertainers you're thinking
of, Jeremy.

682
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,900
- Not astronauts.
- Buzz Aldrin,

683
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,780
a flamboyant man, used to
wear shirts like that.

684
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,660
I met him, he had
an excellent shirt on.

685
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,180
Very funny.
One of my favourite stories
about Buzz Aldrin,

686
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,980
second man on the Moon,
you mentioned him
in your film.

687
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,980
He was being interviewed many
years after the Moon landing.

688
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,980
Very nervous young reporter
standing there.
Live interview, this was.

689
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,900
"We're going over live now,"

690
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,180
and the director's going,
"In five, four..."

691
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,980
And on three,
Buzz Aldrin leant to
the reporter and went,

692
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,620
-"Nothing about the Moon, OK?"
-(LAUGHTER)

693
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,020
-"That's all I've got!"
-"I've got no questions!
I've got literally nothing!"

694
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,140
Anyway, that's enough about
space. I wanna move it on.

695
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,060
Because I came into the
office um...the other day

696
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,660
and told these two that
the Citroen C3 Aircross

697
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,620
that I'd been driving
was very good.

698
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,460
And they said it wasn't.

699
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
-Because it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

700
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,980
And I decided
to prove that it is

701
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,660
by doing one of those
very thorough tests

702
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,900
where we cover
all the things that matter

703
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,140
in a car of this type.

704
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,420
Wait a minute, is this gonna
be one of those stupid films

705
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,420
where you do ridiculous
tests to discover

706
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,460
if a car can, I dunno,
drive faster than itself?

707
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,460
No.

708
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,060
JEREMY:
This is the car in question.

709
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,380
It's a five-seater,
front-wheel drive hatchback.

710
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,460
Prices start at £14,720

711
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,180
and it looks rather funky,

712
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,540
with those splashes of
orange paint here and there.

713
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,660
It's also easy to see out of

714
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,660
because the windows
are made from glass.

715
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,660
And all the controls
fall easily to hand,

716
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,060
because they're on
the dashboard
or the steering wheel,

717
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,180
rather than
under the carpet in the boot.

718
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,140
But you may be wondering
what makes it so special.

719
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,420
Well, to find out, I've
decided to break the test

720
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,140
down into segments,

721
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,100
so that all the important
questions can be answered.

722
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,220
To find out, we've come here

723
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,460
to the banked Millbrook Bowl
in Bedfordshire.

724
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,660
Citroen say
that because the quite small,

725
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,380
1.2 litre,
three-cylinder engine

726
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,820
in this particular version of
the Aircross is turbocharged,

727
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,900
it produces 128 horsepower.

728
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,820
And now it's time
to see what that means

729
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,580
in terms of top speed.

730
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,220
And here we go.

731
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,660
Obviously you can't go
as fast on a banked track

732
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,500
as you can
on the straight and level.

733
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,540
I was going to ask James May
why this is so,

734
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,380
but um...I was frightened
he might tell me so I...

735
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,940
so I didn't.

736
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,780
That's 100, moving up
into the fifth lane,

737
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,620
the lane of terror.

738
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,900
114, there it is.

739
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,860
And I think that's it.

740
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,900
Top speed is...

741
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,220
Oh, 115. No.

742
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,300
The little car
has more to give.

743
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,060
Right, I think we've
established there

744
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,180
that this car's top speed
here on the Millbrook Bowl

745
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,180
is 115 miles an hour.

746
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,660
And that, for a practical,
high-riding, family SUV,

747
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,940
which can do 50 miles to the
gallon in ordinary driving,

748
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,580
is not bad.

749
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,620
But can it do better?

750
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,700
OK, what I've done now is
hooked up to the back end
of a Bentley Bentayga.

751
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,900
Now, this is a car
with a top speed

752
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,900
of 180 miles an hour.

753
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:12,060
What it's doing is,
it's punching a hole
in the air for me

754
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,220
and I'm driving along
in a vacuum.

755
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,700
So that should mean
I go faster. Let's find out.

756
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,420
That's 115 easily.

757
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,140
116...

758
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,940
117...

759
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,340
I'm also using less fuel,

760
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,540
so this is good for
the environment as well.

761
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,660
119, 120 miles an hour now.

762
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,020
121...this is flying!

763
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,620
122 miles an hour, 123!

764
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,420
What we're doing now
is proving

765
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:54,500
that the Citroen C3 Aircross
can go faster than itself.

766
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,580
124!

767
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,940
God's truth,
it's like being in Bluebird!

768
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,580
My only worry is that
I just saw a single magpie

769
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,620
and it is Friday the 13th
as I do this.

770
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,540
So now I'm gonna ease out
of this dangerous situation.

771
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,540
Well, if the space is
smaller than the Aircross,

772
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,500
then the answer is no.

773
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,660
But if the space is bigger,
then the answer is yes.

774
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,100
And with that sorted out,

775
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,940
it's time for one of
the most important tests

776
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,700
a little car can face.

777
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,460
To find out, I've come
to Southampton docks,

778
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,900
where obviously I've been
forced to wear a hard hat

779
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,140
in case a ship...
lands on my head.

780
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,100
Anyway, as you can see, the
little car has been attached

781
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,980
by rope to the enormous
car transporter.

782
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,420
Which I've just noticed
has a face.

783
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,420
It's Boaty McBoatface!

784
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,580
The challenge
I'd come up with

785
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,500
was to see
if the one-tonne C3

786
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,780
could pull
the 13,000-tonne ship

787
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,820
a distance of 25 metres.

788
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,380
Right, now, I should explain

789
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,060
that my colleagues
May and Hammond

790
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,300
think this is a stupid test.

791
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,020
They say the Aircross
only develops 151 torques

792
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:42,020
and that that isn't enough to
pull a medium-sized child.

793
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,780
I, however, disagree.

794
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,060

Oh, hello?
Why's it going backwards?

798
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,780

00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,500

What... The situation's bad.

803
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,420
As we reattached
the tow rope,

804
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,420
I wondered
what had gone wrong.

805
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,060
Why did... Did he put
his engines in reverse
as a sort of amusing joke?

five or six times a day.

964
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,260
Italy is a difficult country
to invade,

965
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,500
because it's surrounded
on three sides by sea

966
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,540

by mountains.

970
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,900
a Tunisian general
called Hannibal

971
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,740
did cross
those mountains,

972
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,740
using elephants
to carry his gear.

973
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,340
And what I want to know is:

974
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,780
could he have used
an Aircross instead?

975
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,060
I mean, obviously,
the Aircross wasn't invented

976
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,820
200 years before
the Baby Jesus,

977
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,620
but if it had been,
could he have used it?

978
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,220
We know that the Citroen
is powerful and torquey.

979
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:21,900
But what really matters on
a job like this is traction.

980
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,180
And that's where this knob
down here comes in.

981
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,300
It engages something called
the grip control system.

982
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,340
And that sounds
like a gimmick.

983
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,140
But it isn't.

00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,300

00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,060

and nothing was moving,

987
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,460

988
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,700

1011
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,420
Come on, little car,
come on, little car.

1012
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,660
That's the engine mountings
you can hear wobbling away,

1013
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,140
but the good news is,
the engine is still in.

1014
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:43,940
With the satnav telling me
Italy was just two miles
away, I found another path.

1015
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,500
I've passed
2,000 metres here.

1016
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,420
Christ,
if I go over the edge now...

1017
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,860
Agh.

1018
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:03,140
Finally, the border
moved into view.

1019
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,140
Come on, little Aircross!

1020
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,620
There you are, clever car!

1021
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,620
So there we are.

1022
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,140
Faster than itself
at the test track.

1023
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,180
Strong enough to pull a ship.

1024
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,460
Big enough for the entire
Jolie family and a horse.

1025
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,900
And better at invading Italy
than an elephant.

1026
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,180
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1027
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,140
-What a car.
-Really?

1028
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,300
What a machine.
Pumpy little car. Amazing.

1029
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,940
Are you all right?

1030
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,780
-In the head, I mean.
-What do you mean?

1031
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,580
We learned nothing.

1032
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,060
You learned it could get
to the top of that mountain,

1033
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,860
even though it doesn't
have four-wheel drive.

1034
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,780
But what about things
that matter to people
who buy that sort of car?

1035
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,340
What about, you know,
boot, interior space?

1036
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,700
-I did boot!
-OK, safety, insurance group,
all that.

1037
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,620
-That's a bit boring.
-And are you seriously
expecting us to believe

1038
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,180
that a little
French hatchback

1039
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:26,100
can catch a tuned De Tomaso
Pantera on a mountain road?

1040
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,940
Well, you say that -
James Bond, Goldeneye,
you may remember.

1041
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,820
He is in his Aston DB5,
he's chasing the Ferrari 355,

1042
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,380
he caught up with it.

1043
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,220
Then there was the other
Bond film called...

1044
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,780
Quantity of Porridge,
something like that.

1045
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,860
He is in his Aston DBS,

1046
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,580
Italian police,
diesel-powered Alfa 159,

1047
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,300
keep up with him
no problem at all.

1048
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,140
You do know they're not
documentaries, don't you?

1049
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:51,300
It was The Rock, The Rock was
a Hummer and a Ferrari again.

1050
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:55,940
Look, can we try and salvage
some useful information
out of this?

1051
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,340
There's no need.

1052
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,980
No, there is, I mean, OK...

1053
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,660
lsn't that Citroen basically,
tell me if I'm right,

1054
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,700
the same car as
the Vauxhall Crossland?

1055
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,420
-It is.
-Yes, it is, good point.

1056
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,140
So, for instance, would you
buy one of those instead?

1057
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:12,300
Well, you can't have
the Vauxhall with
the grip control system,

1058
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,980
so it's no good
as an elephant.

1059
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,260
No, the elephant test
isn't actually relevant.

1060
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,700
Is there not something um...
OK, the Vauxhall, is it...

1061
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:24,020
How easy is it to vacuum out
the interior? There you go.

1062
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,820
I knew you were gonna
mention that.

1063
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,540
So what I did was I took
the Vauxhall down to a man

1064
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,660
who knows a thing or two
about vacuuming,

1065
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,740
none other than Sir Dyson.

1066
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,700
(VACUUM CLEANER WHIRS)

1067
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,100
Can you get
that bit in there?

1068
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,300
(VACUUM CLEANER OFF)

1069
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,900
-Any good?
-Brilliant.

1070
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,500
-Is it?
-Very easy. Brilliant.

1071
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,540
Sir James Dyson.

1072
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,340
Doing a test, an important
test for us there.

1073
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,300
-Actually was James Dyson.
JAMES: Just a minute.

1074
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,340
-What?
-Sir James Dyson

1075
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,820
is developing a new
solid state battery.

1076
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:15,260
He is working on the future
of global personal transport.

1077
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,540
-Yeah.
-And you've wasted
his whole afternoon...

1078
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:23,260
-...vacuuming out
the interior of a Vauxhall.
-Yes.

1079
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,740
-You have literally speeded
up the end of the world.
-Yes.

1080
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,260
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it's time to end.

1081
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,580
Thank you so much for
watching. See you next time.

1082
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,540
-Goodbye.
-(APPLAUSE)

1083
