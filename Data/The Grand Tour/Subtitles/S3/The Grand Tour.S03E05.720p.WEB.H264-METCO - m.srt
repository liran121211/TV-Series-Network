2
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:02,607
Hello! Hello!

3
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,020
What a surprise!

4
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:06,747
Thank you.

5
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:09,348
Thank you very much.

6
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:11,088
Thank you so much.

7
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:13,134
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

8
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,086
Thank you very much.

9
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:20,420
Welcome. And coming up
in this week's show:

10
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:25,357
Abbie is sideways on ice
in a 911 Turbo...

11
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,834
...Richard drives Jim Clark's
beautiful Lotus 25...

12
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:32,857
...and I nearly fall over.

13
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:37,329
That...

14
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:39,215
- Exciting looking show.
- Right.

15
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,912
That is all to come. Now...

16
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:46,045
Hang on a minute. Does that mean
Howard and Adrian aren't coming on?

17
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:48,975
No. Haven't got time.

18
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,724
We actually begin
with the French.

19
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,781
Er... now, they don't make
a sports car very often,

20
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:57,350
but when they do,
literally nobody buys it.

21
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:01,045
We've had
the Venturi Atlantique,

22
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:04,467
and then there was
the Matra Murena,

23
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:06,975
and then there was
the Simca Sport.

24
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,600
And all of them fell down the
back of the sofa of history.

25
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,568
Yeah, yeah, but you're
conveniently forgetting to mention

26
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:16,661
the best of the French
sports car makers.

27
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:19,224
That's like saying the best
of the airborne plagues.

28
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,341
- No.
- The best of the...

29
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,266
No, it isn't.
There is one French maker

30
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,421
that's been consistently good
at making sports cars,

31
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:29,086
and they've made a new one,
and I've been testing it.

32
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,242
It's called the A110,

33
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:44,617
and it's made by Alpine,

34
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:46,283
a French sports car firm

35
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:49,195
who have a history
of hitting the spot.

36
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:53,341
The original A110,
for example,

37
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:58,021
won the World Rally
Championship in 1973.

38
00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:59,821
And it's that car
that gives the new one

39
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:04,563
not only its name
but also its looks.

40
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:16,181
So, what we have here

41
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:19,758
is a small, pure,
no-nonsense sports car

42
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:25,061
aimed squarely at the Porsche
Cayman and the Audi TT.

43
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:29,399
And this, unfortunately, is
where the problems begin.

44
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:36,555
You see, this launch version
of the Alpine costs £51,000.

45
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,061
£51,000.

46
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:42,497
Now, for £1,000 more,
you can have the TT RS.

47
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,438
That's the one Clarkson was
driving in the last series.

48
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:49,742
And that's more powerful,
and it's faster.

49
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,219
And the Porsche Cayman
you buy for £51,000

50
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:56,861
is also more powerful than
this, and it's a Porsche.

51
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,391
Whereas this is an Alpine.

52
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,734
That's something you're going to have
to explain when you're down the pub.

53
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,758
Even the engine
sounds a bit lame.

54
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:11,741
I don't mean
the noise it makes,

55
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:14,701
I mean when somebody asks you,
"What's that got, then, mister?"

56
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:20,524
Because the answer is, "A
four-cylinder 1.8-litre turbo, sonny!"

57
00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:24,250
For over £50,000.
I mean, is that it?

58
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:31,981
Also, I'm not sure
about the looks.

59
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:37,181
The original 1960s version
was a masterpiece.

60
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:41,344
But for me, this modern
reboot doesn't quite work.

61
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,541
The problem, I think,
is that on modern cars

62
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:52,398
there are rules about things like how
high the headlights are above the ground,

63
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:55,261
how forgiving the bonnet is
if you run into a pedestrian.

64
00:04:55,422 --> 00:05:00,336
And once you stretch modern
legislation over 1960s design language,

65
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:04,008
you end up with a sort of
slightly lame tribute act.

66
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:08,078
So, is there anything good
to report?

67
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:11,578
Well, thankfully, yes.

68
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:16,633
For starters, although
Alpine is owned by Renault,

69
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:22,703
this car is not just a hot Mégane
dressed up in some fancy suit.

70
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,969
The A110 is in fact a
mid-engined, rear-drive sports car

71
00:05:27,055 --> 00:05:30,930
designed from scratch,
on a clean sheet of paper.

72
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:38,301
The body and the chassis are
made entirely of aluminium.

73
00:05:38,386 --> 00:05:41,221
And the reason for that
is simple - its lightness.

74
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:43,541
And from that starting point,
the Alpine engineers

75
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:45,797
nerded their way
through the rest of the car

76
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:49,578
and shaved off every
spare gram they could find.

77
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,227
The seats, for example,
are half the weight

78
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,344
of the ones you'll find
in any hot Renault.

79
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,047
The handbrake is built
into the main callipers,

80
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:05,861
rather than being separate,
saving another 2.5 kilos.

81
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:10,644
Even the stereo is a bespoke,
lightweight design.

82
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,001
And then there's
this boot at the front,

83
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:17,669
which is just deep enough for
a small suitcase like this one.

84
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:21,481
But now I think about it, putting the
suitcase in there would just add weight.

85
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:25,461
So what I would do is just pack my
overnight stuff straight in there.

86
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:27,481
The only downside is
that in the morning,

87
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:30,611
I have to go outside if
I want a fresh pair of pants.

88
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,361
So, thanks to Alpine's
fanatical diet regime,

89
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:43,331
this car is 300 kilos lighter
than a Cayman or an Audi TT.

90
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,531
And that has
a profound effect.

91
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,561
Suddenly,
it doesn't really matter

92
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:56,755
that you've only got 1.8
litres and 248 horsepower.

93
00:06:56,864 --> 00:07:00,211
This thing absolutely
zips along.

94
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,302
Nought to 60,
four and a half seconds.

95
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:10,958
Top speed limited
to 155 miles an hour.

96
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:17,716
And then,
when you get to a corner...

97
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:24,271
...you find out just
how agile this thing is.

98
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:36,251
It's like driving a feather.

99
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:49,263
It is like a cartoon car. It should
come with those little bubbles saying...

100
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:59,880
But even though the A110 is
built to minimalist principles,

101
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:02,121
you never feel like
you're in some miserable,

102
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:04,571
Spartan track-day car.

103
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,921
It has air-con, sat-nav,

104
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:10,541
phone connectivity -

105
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:13,357
all the modern things
you want.

106
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,841
This whole lightness
and smallness thing

107
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:23,381
cascades down in a sort
of waterfall of pure joy.

108
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:26,001
Lower weight means you
don't need such big tyres,

109
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:27,601
you don't need so much grip.

110
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:30,341
That gives the car more feel.

111
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:35,561
Low weight means you use less
fuel, you make lower emissions.

112
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:39,013
It's just win-win-win-win
all the way.

113
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:44,325
This is actually the most intelligent
car I've driven for years.

114
00:08:45,386 --> 00:08:48,333
And I love it for that.
I love it.

115
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:04,521
Thank you.

116
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:06,001
Erm...

117
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,824
So... So despite
the ordinary engine,

118
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,801
the looks that
you're not sure about,

119
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,521
and the high price,
you liked it?

120
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:18,101
I did. I loved it, yeah.

121
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:20,919
- Yes, but would you buy one?
- I have.

122
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:24,721
- You've bought one of those?
- I have.

123
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:26,581
And actually,
so has Gordon Murray.

124
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,281
I've brought
a picture of him along. Him.

125
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:31,141
He designed the McLaren F1,
so he knows.

126
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:35,461
Yeah, so it's the sports car of choice
for old men with terrible shirts.

127
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:37,989
- So that's good to know.
- Evidently.

128
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:42,531
But, now let's see how fast it goes
round the Eboladrome, shall we?

129
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:44,927
And she's off.

130
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:48,721
Brisk start, and a parp from
the exhaust on the up-change.

131
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,921
Immediately onto
the Isn't Straight.

132
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:54,974
And actually,
that's not hanging around.

133
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:58,161
Perhaps James was right
about the benefits of...

134
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:00,901
whatever it was
he was saying.

135
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:04,503
Howling round
the final bend of the Isn't.

136
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:09,302
Dropping down now
into Your Name Here.

137
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:11,481
Scrubbing off speed
in a hurry.

138
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:15,513
Torturing those tyres, but
that does look pretty nimble.

139
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:20,357
Now, the canter back down
the Isn't, picking up speed.

140
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:24,333
Dab of brakes
at the mid-point.

141
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:27,638
Now much harder
on the brakes,

142
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:30,721
flicking down the seven-speed
box for Old Lady's House.

143
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:32,661
Any understeer?

144
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:34,982
No, not bad
for a mid-engined car

145
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,721
with no weight over the nose.

146
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:39,681
I actually rather
like the styling of this,

147
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,341
and I'm right.

148
00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:44,396
Just Field of Sheep
to go now.

149
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:46,061
Here we are.

150
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,888
And oh, yes, that's an
exuberant drift to finish,

151
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,726
and across the line!

152
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:53,261
Very good.

153
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:55,321
Very good.
Good driving, on form.

154
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:58,802
Right.

155
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:02,681
Right, let's see where it
goes on our lap board.

156
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:05,333
Will it go in the top ten?

157
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,520
Oh, dear, no, it doesn't.

158
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:09,536
Sorry, May, that is dismal

159
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:11,861
for a mid-engined car.
It is.

160
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:14,921
It isn't about things like
lap times. I told you before.

161
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:17,121
He who is first
shall be last,

162
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:19,261
and the last
shall be first.

163
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,121
- Yes, but it's 15th.
- It is, yeah.

164
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:23,771
- It is, it is.
- So?

165
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,114
It's the Romain Grosjean
of cars, that is.

166
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,888
- Romain who?
- Grosjean.

167
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:30,721
- Who's he?
- He's a French racing driver.

168
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:34,036
The 15th best Formula One
driver in the world, in fact.

169
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:36,171
- You'd like him.
- I already do.

170
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:37,880
Good. Good,
so we've sorted that out.

171
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:40,825
It's time for us to move on,
because right now it is time

172
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:44,896
for us to scrump
an apple of chat

173
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,564
from the orchard
of intercourse,

174
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:50,684
which is on
Conversation Street.

175
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:58,844
- I like that one.
- I thought you would.

176
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:01,927
- I like that one a lot.
- That's so up your street.

177
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:05,732
Um... right now, lots of
people these days

178
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:07,104
are buying old cars,

179
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:09,216
and we think we can see why.

180
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:12,216
Yeah, because an old Jaguar
E-Type, or Alfa Spider,

181
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:15,013
is far more interesting to
look at than any modern car,

182
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:16,521
and it won't depreciate.

183
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:18,310
In fact,
it'll make you money.

184
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,622
Yeah, the trouble is, though,
you get into your old car,

185
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,534
and it's crap.

186
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:25,544
He's absolutely right,

187
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,974
we forget how terrible
old cars were, really.

188
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,964
I mean, if you go more
than 40 miles an hour,

189
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,099
the windscreen wipers part
company with the windscreen.

190
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:36,224
- Yes.
- And the headlamps are like candles in jam jars.

191
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:38,644
- And the demister doesn't.
- No, it doesn't.

192
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:40,304
- And the heater doesn't.
- No.

193
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:42,204
And everything else rattles,
and the brakes don't work.

194
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:44,344
- Exactly.
- That's old cars, they were...

195
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:47,524
I speak from experience. I've
got a 40-year-old Ferrari, a 308.

196
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:52,184
Apart from all those things, it's
catastrophically slow. You wouldn't believe it.

197
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:54,624
I pull away from lights, and people
behind honk because they think,

198
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,244
- "That's a Ferrari, that'll... Oh."
- Yeah.

199
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:58,804
They honk? Doesn't that
happen in any car you drive?

200
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:01,124
- No, no, no...
- "Oh, get out of the way!"

201
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:02,384
Pretty much.

202
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:03,684
But it is unbelievable
just how poor it is.

203
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:05,104
Very slow.

204
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:07,604
But that's the exact point
we're trying to make here.

205
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:10,524
There are now loads of companies
who will take an old car

206
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,544
and then gently modernise it.

207
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,164
Got some examples here
of what we're on about.

208
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:18,064
There's this, which
is the Singer Porsche,

209
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:19,524
I'm obviously not
very interested in that.

210
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,604
These two are,
but I couldn't care less.

211
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:24,704
Then you've got the Eagle,
er... E-Type Speedster,

212
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:27,104
one of the best-looking cars
I've ever seen.

213
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:31,104
That's an actual E-Type, and one of the
most beautiful to drive. Absolute honey.

214
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:34,644
Yeah, there's a company in Germany
now, and they are modernising lightly.

215
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:36,664
Remember those old
Mercedes Pagoda SLs?

216
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,724
- Oh, yeah.
- They're putting AMG engines in.

217
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:41,719
What, mo... That's got a
modern AMG engine in it?

218
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:44,337
Do you want to have a
look at the engine? Another shot.

219
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:46,202
- Hang on. 
- There it is, look at that!

220
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:48,744
- That is a car.
- I see you like that.

221
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,986
- Very, very much.
- I've got something you'll like more.

222
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:52,944
- Have you?
- Mm-hm.

223
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:54,944
Oh, my God!

224
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:57,044
That is an old
'68 Dodge Charger.

225
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,891
- You used to have one.
- I did.

226
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:04,633
But someone has put in that a
1,000-horsepower modern-day Hellcat engine.

227
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,784
Aw!

228
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:07,469
- I mean...
- I...

229
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:09,814
I need some time alone...

230
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:13,184
- with that picture.
- It's just...

231
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,469
That is such
a good idea, this, I think.

232
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,404
It is actually, and
it's a very good point.

233
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,864
We all think we would like a
Jensen Interceptor, don't we?

234
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:22,424
But the fact is it won't go,

235
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:25,064
it won't stop if it ever does
go, the brakes won't work,

236
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:26,684
all the rest of it -
terrible thing.

237
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:29,144
But here is
a Jensen Interceptor,

238
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,764
but that has modern brakes,
has a modern cooling system,

239
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:34,321
and it has the engine
from a Corvette.

240
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:37,305
No, it does. I've actually driven
that very car, and it's epic.

241
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:39,069
Well, that one isn't
anymore, because somebody

242
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:40,670
wrapped it round a
fence in Goodwood.

243
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,607
- Spoiled it.
- But it was epic before that.

244
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,561
It's a fantastic car, it really, really is.

245
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:46,564
I'd like to explain, by the
way, that squeaking noise

246
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,624
is not James thinking,
it's...

247
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,064
...it's the wind.

248
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,404
- It's quite a breezy day.
- It's a breezy day.

249
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:57,184
And we decided to base ourselves
in a tent because we're mad.

250
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:58,778
- And on a hill.
- And on a hill.

251
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,099
But I think the problem

252
00:15:00,185 --> 00:15:01,997
with all of these
reimagined cars

253
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,528
is that they're expensive,
they're too expensive.

254
00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:07,567
That Mercedes Pagoda SL,
that's £300,000,

255
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:09,824
those Singer Porsches,
£400,000,

256
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,464
that E-Type Speedster,
650 grand - it's just crazy.

257
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:16,372
The problem is that the companies
who are doing this kind of work,

258
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:18,703
they know they can charge
that kind of money,

259
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:20,989
cos the customers
that come to their workshops

260
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,755
invariably arrive
in a helicopter

261
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:28,239
with a Ukrainian girlfriend
and Lewis Hamilton's watch.

262
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,356
And the fact is, if you're
gonna dress up like that

263
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:31,964
and act like that,
if you're gonna show off,

264
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,684
you'll get ripped off,
that's the way it is.

265
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:36,464
- They charge accordingly, don't they?
- That's asking for it.

266
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:38,372
What you should do is
ring them up and say,

267
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,031
"Could you collect me from the station?"

268
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:41,263
- No.
- That'd be better.

269
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:43,357
No, the bus stop. "Pick
me up from the bus stop",

270
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,842
I've come to look at
these cars you're making."

271
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:47,388
I've just had a thought.
Right, picture this.

272
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:49,810
An original Opel Manta A.
Remember the one?

273
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:51,724
- The round taillights?
- Yeah... yeah, black bonnet.

274
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,294
But with the engine from a
modern Vauxhall VXR in it.

275
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,497
So I just find some blokes
that'll do that for me,

276
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:02,817
I do that on the phone, and then I go
and visit them on the bus in a tracksuit.

277
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:04,704
And you'll get charged
50 quid.

278
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:07,484
Well, probably 40, cos I need a
tenner to get home on the bus.

279
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,384
Ooh, now.

280
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,144
There's a new electric car

281
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:14,466
from, you're not
going to believe this...

282
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,664
- Kalashnikov.
- Really?

283
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:20,435
Yeah, the people who make AK-47s are
going to start making electric cars.

284
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,817
I like the sound of that.

285
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:24,444
Do you want to see
a picture of it? Here it is.

286
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,424
- Ah.
- Oh.

287
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:30,247
No, don't laugh, because from
the back it's actually worse.

288
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,604
- There you go.
- You're right, it is.

289
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:36,325
Now, I assumed that it would
have eight moving parts,

290
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:39,104
that you could bury it
in a bog for three months

291
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:41,326
and that it would only jam
if Richard Hammond used it.

292
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:42,784
Yes, all right.

293
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:46,304
But they say it has
revolutionary technology.

294
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:49,504
Does it? Does it have
central locking, and loading?

295
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:52,290
More importantly, can you fire
it in the air at weddings?

296
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:53,504
You probably would.

297
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:55,703
"Exam results, children,"
they go out and do that.

298
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:58,704
No, but I think the idea of driving
a car called a Kalashnikov...

299
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:01,328
- It sounds brilliant.
- Oh, yeah, pretty good.

300
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:03,852
Yeah. "What are you
driving these days, Rich?"

301
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:06,304
- "Well, it's a Kalashnikov."
- There you go.

302
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:07,634
- There you go.
- The problem is,

303
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,843
I reckon they're gonna
sell a lot of T-shirts

304
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,044
and mugs and hats
with the name on,

305
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:13,904
but not many actual cars.

306
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:16,544
- Like Ferrari?
- Basically Ferrari, yeah.

307
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:18,875
Oh, er, here's one.

308
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:20,804
There's a story I got
from the Dorset Echo,

309
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:23,384
which is a local newspaper
in Dorset.

310
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:27,344
And, um... I think it wins the
award for unnecessary reporting,

311
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,404
because it's about
a crash that happened

312
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:31,624
between
a motorcyclist and a tank.

313
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:35,604
Happened... Yeah, happened near that
army base down there. OK, and it says,

314
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:39,464
"The motorcyclist sustained a
suspected fracture to his arm and leg."

315
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,404
And here's the line
they probably didn't need:

316
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:43,324
"The driver of the tank
was uninjured."

317
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:44,984
- Oh, was he?
- No?

318
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:47,804
Well, he was lucky to get
away with that, wasn't he?

319
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:50,544
Was he really?

320
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:52,884
I suspect he got back to base
and went, "I hit a what?"

321
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:55,144
"Did I?"

322
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:57,633
Good conversation here, I think.
Very good conversation.

323
00:17:57,719 --> 00:17:59,567
Because they've
announced a new type

324
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:01,564
of motor racing
championship for women.

325
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:03,584
It's called the W Series, OK?

326
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,633
And the idea is is that
potentially quite good, you know,

327
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,711
women racing drivers can
take part in this series.

328
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:12,504
Cars are all
exactly the same,

329
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:13,884
you're invited
to take part,

330
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,904
and the prize money
is £1.1 million.

331
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:19,492
So, it's, you know,
fairly incentivised.

332
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,189
There's actually been
a lot of discussion about it,

333
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:22,946
or actually debate,
I should say.

334
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:26,864
Cos some people are saying it's sexist
to have a women-only championship.

335
00:18:26,949 --> 00:18:29,781
But if you think about it, you've
got women-only football, and rugby

336
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:31,742
and hockey - all Olympic
sports, pretty much,

337
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:33,391
are segregated
between men and women,

338
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:35,048
so I can't see why motor
racing should be different.

339
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,992
Not all sports, though.
Men and women compete

340
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:39,284
directly against each other
in dressage.

341
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,624
Yeah, but that's not a sport.
It isn't.

342
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:44,924
That's just sitting on a horse
while it tries to look camp.

343
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:48,644
All right, then, they can...

344
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,504
He's right.

345
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,164
It is, though.

346
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:53,624
You're right, actually.

347
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,764
There's no segregation, then,
between men and women

348
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:57,604
in sailing, they compete
against each other.

349
00:18:57,689 --> 00:19:01,224
That's not a sport either,
is it? Sailing is a job.

350
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,984
You have to pull
pieces of rope...

351
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:04,764
- All right, then!
- It's manual labour.

352
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:06,704
It's manual labour.
It's not a sport.

353
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:08,742
There's a world of difference
between any of that

354
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,904
and single-seater car racing.

355
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,584
Why, though? Why is it?

356
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:15,264
Is it, "Oh, well, you need
manly strength to do it?"

357
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:17,364
Cos you don't, anyway,
cos even an F1 car

358
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,904
has power steering
these days.

359
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:21,284
But I was driving a single-seater
race car the other day,

360
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,524
I can't remember what or
where but it had slick tyres.

361
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,624
After three laps, my neck muscles had...
I was like this.

362
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,404
I hadn't got the strength
to lift my head up,

363
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:31,904
I had to wait for the next corner
to roll over the other way.

364
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:34,144
Now, I know, you know,
Navratilova and the Williams girl,

365
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:35,924
you wouldn't want to
arm-wrestle either of them,

366
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,704
so women can build up their
muscles to compensate for that.

367
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,164
So, wait, are you saying that
there should be segregation

368
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:43,304
with women and men
in motor sport?

369
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:44,764
Well, it doesn't really
matter what I think.

370
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,404
The fact is, it's 43 years
since there was a...

371
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:50,144
a girl in
a Formula One motor race.

372
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:52,604
43 years. Something's going
wrong, they're not making it.

373
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:54,884
I think it's grass roots.
It happens early on.

374
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:58,704
I think too many mothers put
their little daughters on ponies

375
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:00,164
and not into go-karts.

376
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:02,144
No, not entirely.

377
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:05,144
Some girls do go karting,
cos Abbie, our driver,

378
00:20:05,229 --> 00:20:07,391
she was karting since
she was a little nipper.

379
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:09,235
Well... I think what
this series is all about,

380
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,610
it's not about segregation,
it's about encouraging women

381
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:13,555
to go car racing, which
I think is a good idea.

382
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:16,404
Yeah, I think it is, but I think
it has to start early on. So,

383
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:19,404
little girls, it's time
to get off your ponies,

384
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:21,382
and get into a go-kart.

385
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:25,623
And I can tell you actually,
from some experience of horses,

386
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:28,284
the good thing is, when you
walk out in the morning,

387
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,211
you'll find that your go-kart

388
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:33,125
hasn't crapped itself
and died in the night.

389
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:35,584
So it's better
than your horse.

390
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,864
You'll also find out that
go-karts are more fun

391
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:39,764
than going on "an horse",
they just are.

392
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:41,284
Yes, yes.
And you'll find also

393
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,859
that a go-kart won't pop
its long, stupid head up

394
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:46,784
over the stable door
and look at you,

395
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:49,904
and you know it's thinking,
it's trying to say to you,

396
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:52,924
"Yeah, your wife, she's back
here with me, in here."

397
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:55,224
Er... she's given me
breakfast in bed,

398
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:59,704
"crapped myself last night, but she's
clearing that up with a garden fork."

399
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:02,273
And then it says,
"And my penis is a bit dirty.

400
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:05,584
She'll be sorting that out
for me later on."

401
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:08,172
Then your wife's head will
pop up over the stable door

402
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:11,644
and she'll say, "Don't look at him like
that, he'll think you don't like him,"

403
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,484
and you'll say, "I know!"

404
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:17,724
If I could speak horse, I
would tell him, "I hate you."

405
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,344
I hate the way you steal
my wife and my money

406
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:23,504
"and my status around here."

407
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,995
And then one day, you'll
have a conversation

408
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:27,354
with your wife, and she'll say,

409
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,304
"Darling, I need a trailer to move my
special horse around to wonderful places"

410
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:33,383
because these fields
are too small for him

411
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:35,524
"to exercise his magnificent,
muscled legs."

412
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:37,828
And you'll say,
"OK, I'll get you a trailer."

413
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:39,584
Then she'll say,
"I need a special car

414
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:41,898
to tow the special trailer
to carry the special horse."

415
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:44,164
So you'll get one.
And then one day, she'll say,

416
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,930
"I need a lorry,
a great big lorry,"

417
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,164
to carry my great, big magnificent
horse around the country,

418
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:53,584
and the lorry must have
a kitchen and a bed in it

419
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:55,404
so I can sleep
close to my horse,

420
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:57,544
"closer to my horse
than I am to you."

421
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:00,324
And at that moment, your head will
bow and your heart will break,

422
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,824
because you know you have
lost, and the horse has won.

423
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:06,294
That's very good.

424
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:11,454
That is, um...

425
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:16,406
- Slightly off.
- We trod on the H-bomb.

426
00:22:16,492 --> 00:22:19,203
Every time you mention the
horse word to him, he's off.

427
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:20,383
Oh, did it again!

428
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:23,062
I think we probably end... Well,
it's not Conversation Street,

429
00:22:23,148 --> 00:22:24,484
that was Rant Street
from Hammond.

430
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:27,367
- Sorry about that.
- Let's move it on, shall we? Right.

431
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:30,164
There's a new off-road
four-wheel drive Lamborghini.

432
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,281
It's called the Urus, and
to find out if it's any good,

433
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,516
I took The Grand Tour
to Sweden,

434
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:38,422
armed with some questions.

435
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,444
Here's my first big question:

436
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:55,204
If you build a car
to tackle terrain like this,

437
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:58,828
can it still be
a proper Lambo?

438
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:09,364
Well, the Urus
certainly looks

439
00:23:09,449 --> 00:23:12,195
like a jacked-up supercar.

440
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:16,384
With its swivel-eyed styling,

441
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:19,312
it appears to be every
inch a Lamborghini.

442
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,669
But is it?

443
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:27,204
To make this car,
Lambo's engineers

444
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:31,144
had a good rummage around
in Volkswagen's parts bin.

445
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:35,084
So the engine, a four-litre
V8, is from a Porsche Panamera.

446
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:37,764
The rear axle
and air suspension

447
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,144
is from
a Bentley Bentayga.

448
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:41,964
The platform
on which it sits,

449
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:46,904
and a lot of the dashboard,
is from an Audi SQ7.

450
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:52,125
So, does that mean this isn't
really a Lamborghini at all?

451
00:24:09,637 --> 00:24:14,272
Well, it does 0-60
in 3.6 seconds.

452
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:19,999
And it has a top speed
of 189.

453
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:28,304
So, it has the performance
you'd expect.

454
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:32,544
But there's other stuff
you wouldn't expect.

455
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:35,464
This is the first Lamborghini
to use turbocharging,

456
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:38,824
and the first
to have an automatic gearbox.

457
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,784
What that combination means
is there's a very slight

458
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:44,104
and rather
un-Lamborghini-ish gap

459
00:24:44,189 --> 00:24:48,239
between putting your foot
down and it getting going.

460
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:53,624
And when it does get going,

461
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,864
there are
no screaming histrionics.

462
00:24:56,949 --> 00:25:00,239
Sure, there's a bit of popping
and banging from the back.

463
00:25:03,189 --> 00:25:05,064
But you can't hear
that inside,

464
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:08,264
where everything is
muted and refined.

465
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:09,984
Perhaps that's why
all the writing

466
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:12,464
down here is in Latin.

467
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:15,264
This is a Lamborghini for
emeritus professors.

468
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:20,039
I can see the Pope
in one of these.

469
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:28,104
So, it's quiet
and a bit hesitant.

470
00:25:28,189 --> 00:25:29,744
And it has snazzy diffs

471
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:32,133
and a clever
traction-control system.

472
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:36,784
And the biggest carbon brakes
ever fitted to a road car.

473
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,399
So it's safe as well.

474
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,464
However, there's no
getting around the fact

475
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:46,016
that I'm currently driving
on snow and ice

476
00:25:46,102 --> 00:25:51,544
in a car that has
641 horsepowers

477
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:54,864
rampaging around
underneath its bonnet.

478
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:02,679
Which means that, actually,
it's not that safe at all.

479
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:06,119
Ooh, God above.

480
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:10,239
Concentrating.

481
00:26:11,949 --> 00:26:14,879
Twitchy and it's scary!

482
00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:20,133
It's like I've been
put in charge

483
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:21,867
of all of the world's
physics,

484
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:24,919
while I'm in a phone box
full of wasps.

485
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:27,586
Ee! Stop, leave me alone!

486
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:30,919
I'm doing tides
and gravity... Agh, stop!

487
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:35,263
This car, then,
it sits right at the moment

488
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:39,904
where excitement stops
and terror begins.

489
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:42,820
That is Lambo land, that is.

490
00:26:43,475 --> 00:26:44,995
Shit!

491
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:56,439
So, the Urus looks and feels
like a Lamborghini.

492
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:02,086
It's also practical.
The boot is massive.

493
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:06,549
And inside, there's space
for five six-footers.

494
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:10,529
It's a nice place to be
as well.

495
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:13,043
And all that's great.

496
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:17,109
But does it work off-road?

497
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:22,482
To find out,
I'm going to try and drive it

498
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:24,703
to the top
of this ski resort.

499
00:27:24,828 --> 00:27:27,224
Now, it's wearing
these tyres,

500
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:29,304
which have no studs
in them, or spikes.

501
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:31,784
And I'm wearing these,

502
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:36,544
which are not delicate
Italian driving shoes.

503
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:39,279
Not sure
this is gonna go well.

504
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:42,984
Problems actually get
worse when you're in here

505
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,384
because there's no manual
locking differentials,

506
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:48,144
there's no low-range gearbox.

507
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:51,367
All you can do
is fire it up...

508
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:55,047
and then put the drive
system into snow mode.

509
00:27:56,229 --> 00:27:58,242
Is... Is that snow?

510
00:27:58,383 --> 00:28:00,639
Is "Neve" Latin for snow?

511
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:04,484
Think it might be.
So, let's see if that works.

512
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:05,937
Here we go.

513
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:09,593
Mustn't hit a skier, mustn't
hit a skier. Oh, it's moving.

514
00:28:14,223 --> 00:28:18,234
The 165,000-pound Lamborghini

515
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,399
is driving up a ski slope.

516
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,508
Those turbo chargers
may be a little bit annoying

517
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:28,304
on the road,
but here they're giving me

518
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:32,719
the low-down torque that
I need to get up this hill.

519
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,984
And I've got an inclinometer,

520
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:39,279
like you used to get in
an old Mitsubishi Shogun.

521
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,504
This is actually quite impressive,
it's just dropped down into first.

522
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:56,079
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

523
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:01,959
Hello,
bewildered-looking skiers.

524
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:10,624
I cannot believe
that this is a 2.4-ton car...

525
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:13,319
on normal road tyres,
and it's doing this.

526
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:18,584
Come on, come on, come on,
you can do it. Come on.

527
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:21,479
Come on, come on. Come on.

528
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:27,104
Oh, hang on a minute.

529
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:30,304
Yeah.

530
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:36,039
Yeah, I now can believe it's a 2.4-ton
car on normal road tyres cos it's stuck.

531
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:38,624
No.

532
00:29:38,748 --> 00:29:41,318
Oh.

533
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,730
Right.

534
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:47,236
So, what we've established
so far is that,

535
00:29:47,322 --> 00:29:49,257
yes, it is a Lamborghini.

536
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:53,099
Feels exciting like
a Lamborghini... should.

537
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:55,384
And, um... I meant this.

538
00:29:55,469 --> 00:29:57,104
And, er... it's good
off-road as well,

539
00:29:57,189 --> 00:30:00,639
but just not quite
as good as a Range Rover.

540
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:06,104
Which leaves us with
one more thing to answer:

541
00:30:06,189 --> 00:30:08,599
Is it a good laugh?

542
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:12,504
What we've done
is use a snow plough

543
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:16,319
to create a racetrack
on this frozen lake.

544
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:24,344
And this is
what we have planned.

545
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:26,624
I'm going to try
and overtake this,

546
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:30,344
a four-wheel drive
Porsche 911 Turbo,

547
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:35,984
which is being driven by The Grand
Tour's racing driver Abbie Eaton.

548
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:39,464
- Have you seen this crack?
- I hadn't noticed that before.

549
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:40,984
Look at the state of this!

550
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:42,784
You're the heavier
car, aren't you?

551
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:46,927
Hm, that's 2.4 tons,
and I weigh half a ton.

552
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:49,304
Are you not worried
about that?

553
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,744
I haven't got my seatbelt on, so if it
goes under, I can get out straightaway.

554
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:55,199
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

555
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:58,384
Before the duel began,

556
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:01,701
I had a few practice laps
on my own.

557
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:07,424
Oh, heavens.

558
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:09,559
Come on, turn!

559
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,199
Whoops, I'm going off a bit.

560
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:17,563
Ooh!

561
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:22,384
Ah, my Urus is a bit twitchy.

562
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:24,879
Sort of thing
you'd say to your doctor.

563
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:28,479
Right, flick it in there.

564
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:32,359
Now go the other way,
and power.

565
00:31:34,989 --> 00:31:36,357
Oh, yeah.

566
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:41,999
Mouse in, lion out.

567
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:44,679
That's what
they say in Sweden.

568
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:51,787
I'm making my own fog now!

569
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:56,553
It may not be able to get as far
up a ski slope as a Range Rover,

570
00:31:56,709 --> 00:31:59,239
but for doing this,

571
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:01,704
it's better.

572
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:07,984
But, would it be good enough

573
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:10,999
to get past Abbie
in that Porsche?

574
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:15,624
There she is.

575
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:17,424
There she is!

576
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:25,199
The bell has sounded,
the race is on.

577
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:30,024
Now we'd find out what's what

578
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:33,159
on our specially
designed track.

579
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:37,199
Right, round the Bell End.

580
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:42,279
Now down the Shaft...

581
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:46,439
to what we're calling
the Parabollocka.

582
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:54,839
I've raced against a few dicks
in my time but never on one.

583
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:02,039
I should be able to get her,
for heaven's sake, come on!

584
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:07,279
She, of course, has four-
wheel-steering, same as I do.

585
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,999
Oh, she has got better
braking than I have.

586
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:18,039
Now, give me 641 horsepower!

587
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:24,144
Oh, yeah.

588
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:28,479
You know I said it was
a bit hesitant sometimes?

589
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:31,599
Well, in Corsa mode,
it isn't.

590
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:38,639
It's bob-on, this. Bob-on!

591
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:43,624
Ooh, she's gone wide,
is there a chance here?

592
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:44,709
Come on!

593
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:49,469
Now, now!

594
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:53,744
Bollocks.

595
00:33:53,829 --> 00:33:56,399
Come on now, Jeremy.

596
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:03,629
Come on!

597
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,060
Come on, you can have her!

598
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,068
Come on!

599
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:22,264
For lap after lap,
the big heavy Urus

600
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:25,624
clawed at the rear end
of the 911 Turbo.

601
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:28,439
Oh, God. Nearly!

602
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:29,858
Now.

603
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:35,109
But eventually,
I had to admit defeat.

604
00:34:35,195 --> 00:34:37,790
I can't get past that 911,
and that's just an end of it,

605
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,472
but I can keep up.

606
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:43,484
And in an off-road car...

607
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:46,115
that is fairly
astonishing.

608
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,921
It really is.

609
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:55,864
Certainly, I can believe
Lamborghini's claim

610
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:59,239
that this is the fastest
off-road car...

611
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:02,159
in the world.

612
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:11,264
- That was quite good fun.
- Looked like fun, yeah. A nice day out.

613
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:13,064
- I got paid for that.
- That was your job.

614
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:15,719
That is work.
Doing that is my work.

615
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:18,744
Um... it probably won't be

616
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:21,224
the fastest off-road car in the
world for very long, though,

617
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:23,784
because both Aston Martin
and Ferrari have got, er...

618
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:26,064
- big SUVs coming out this year.
- Yeah. Yeah.

619
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:28,464
Whatever. Thing is,
could you really tell people

620
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:30,344
that you have a Urus?

621
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:34,464
Cos it... it sounds like a
minor alien out of Star Trek.

622
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,704
- Yeah.
- But it does work as a Lamborghini.

623
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:38,744
Yeah. But no.

624
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,424
Well, this is excellent
consumer advice.

625
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:43,944
- I'm glad we...
- Yeah, it's very clear, very clear.

626
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:45,544
The thing is,
after I made that film,

627
00:35:45,629 --> 00:35:47,424
which was quite good fun,

628
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:49,224
I came home and I thought,
the trouble is

629
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:52,544
it could do with being
a bit more Aventador-ish.

630
00:35:52,629 --> 00:35:55,304
It could do with being
a bit more mad.

631
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,984
Are you saying
you changed your mind?

632
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:58,624
- Yes.
- Oh, great.

633
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:00,864
So, Prime Minister Clarkson
returns from the summit:

634
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:03,144
"I've declared war,
but on the plane home"

635
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:05,504
I had another think about it
and I'm not so sure now.

636
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:07,901
- "I've changed my mind."
- Exactly, that's what I've done.

637
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:10,167
Good, well, since we're in
such a sensible frame of mind,

638
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:11,984
I'd like to move
things on now,

639
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,639
um, with a brief
history lesson.

640
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:31,104
On April the 7th, 1968,

641
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,184
a racing driver was killed
in a Formula Two race

642
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:36,439
in Hockenheim, Germany.

643
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:42,217
Sadly, the driver's death was
not a surprising occurrence,

644
00:36:42,552 --> 00:36:46,187
because such was the danger
of the sport back then,

645
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:50,640
he was one of
127 racing drivers

646
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:54,439
who would die at the wheel
that year alone.

647
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:58,464
This time, though,
the death sent shockwaves

648
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,384
through the motorsport world,

649
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:03,784
because it had just lost the
man who was unquestionably

650
00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:06,784
the greatest
racing driver of his day,

651
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:11,679
and who many argue is still
the greatest of all time.

652
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:19,064
Jim Clark
has died in an accident

653
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:22,784
during a Formula Two
race in West Germany.

654
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:25,144
It was a
terrible shock to everybody.

655
00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:27,944
It really
knocked us all back.

656
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:29,944
If there was anybody
who was not gonna have

657
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:32,424
a fatal accident
it was Jim Clark.

658
00:37:32,509 --> 00:37:34,824
Because he drove
in such a way

659
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:38,024
that he just
didn't do the mistakes

660
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:40,199
that other drivers did.

661
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,885
In California, a
radio station broadcaster

662
00:37:45,189 --> 00:37:47,744
announcing the news
of Clark's death

663
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:52,464
asked his listeners to turn on their
headlights as a mark of respect...

664
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:55,759
and the freeways lit up.

665
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:00,504
Such a huge global fuss

666
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:03,584
would not have sat
easily with Clark,

667
00:38:03,669 --> 00:38:05,984
because this shy, modest man,

668
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:08,024
the son of
a Scottish sheep farmer,

669
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:11,439
was never one
to trumpet his own skills.

670
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:14,144
I started as an amateur

671
00:38:14,229 --> 00:38:17,864
with no idea or no intention
of becoming World Champion,

672
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:21,304
But, er... it was,
I was curious to find out,

673
00:38:21,389 --> 00:38:24,264
um... what it was like
to drive a car fast,

674
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:25,944
to drive on
a certain circuit,

675
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:28,944
to drive
a certain type of car.

676
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:31,824
Having cut his teeth
in sports car racing

677
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,344
in the late '50s,

678
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:34,944
Clark's speed and talent

679
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:37,984
was spotted by Lotus boss
Colin Chapman,

680
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:42,119
who signed him for his
Formula One team in 1960.

681
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:49,824
Clark soon set
the motorsport world alight.

682
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:52,879
Especially in this car...

683
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:57,039
The Lotus 25.

684
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,399
In which, in 1963...

685
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:06,199
he won his first
F1 World Championship.

686
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:11,944
Oh, my God!

687
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:15,639
I am sitting
where Jim Clark sat.

688
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,599
This is electrifying!

689
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:28,959
These were not powerful cars.

690
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:32,544
They only made
210 brake horsepower

691
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:34,904
from one and a half litres,

692
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:38,719
but they were still good
for 180 miles an hour.

693
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:41,749
Oh, ho!

694
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:47,144
Thanks to its revolutionary
monocoque chassis,

695
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:49,904
the 25
was stiffer and lighter

696
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:52,024
than any other F1 car.

697
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:55,964
Which meant it wasn't
just fast on the straights,

698
00:39:56,049 --> 00:39:58,879
but quicker
through the corners too.

699
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:01,864
And in the 1963 season,

700
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:04,824
Clark used it
to win a record seven

701
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:07,184
out of the ten Grands Prix.

702
00:40:07,269 --> 00:40:09,184
Winner is Jim Clark.

703
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:12,119
Nobody could
possibly catch him now.

704
00:40:14,669 --> 00:40:19,744
But 1963 was just a warm-up
for what was to come.

705
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:22,784
To get a true picture
of Clark's genius,

706
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:25,224
we must look at another year.

707
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,344
1965.

708
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:31,384
When he hit heights
no driver had reached before,

709
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:34,039
or has done since.

710
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:40,344
A modern Formula One
driver does 21 races a year

711
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:42,664
and often complains
that's too many.

712
00:40:42,749 --> 00:40:47,744
In 1965,
Jim Clark raced in 63 races.

713
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:49,079
Some of these cars
look similar,

714
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:50,666
but they are all
completely different.

715
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:53,824
In a car like this, he'd do
Formula One Championship.

716
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,224
He raced in the British
Formula Two Championship,

717
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:59,624
and the French Formula Two
Championship in this car.

718
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:01,424
He raced in
the Tasman Series,

719
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:05,144
a sort of Australian Grand Prix
for Down Under, in this car.

720
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,064
And then
there's this Lotus Cortina,

721
00:41:07,149 --> 00:41:09,744
in which he decided
to race in touring cars.

722
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:11,904
And then if all that
wasn't enough,

723
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:15,559
he decided to go for
the Indy 500.

724
00:41:17,189 --> 00:41:22,464
First up was the Tasman
Series in Australasia.

725
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:23,904
Out of the 15 races,

726
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:27,744
Clark won 11
and took the crown.

727
00:41:27,836 --> 00:41:30,779
Then it was back to
Europe for the British

728
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:33,759
and French Formula
Two Championships,

729
00:41:34,296 --> 00:41:36,381
both of which he won.

730
00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:38,999
Jim Clark led from the start.

731
00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:41,344
Winner is Jim Clark.

732
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:43,664
And in between the F2 races,

733
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:46,064
he was jumping into
his Lotus Cortina

734
00:41:46,149 --> 00:41:49,199
and racking up
touring car victories.

735
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:51,944
And, on top of all that,

736
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:53,999
there was America.

737
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,304
The Indianapolis 500

738
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:00,424
has been called
the greatest

739
00:42:00,509 --> 00:42:02,464
spectacle in racing.

740
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:06,064
America's
most prestigious race

741
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,384
would be a tough challenge.

742
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:12,064
Oval racing at higher average
speeds than he was used to

743
00:42:12,149 --> 00:42:14,719
against seasoned
Indy veterans.

744
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:18,744
For the Indy 500,

745
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,544
Clark raced a specially
developed Lotus

746
00:42:20,629 --> 00:42:23,984
producing just shy
of 500 horsepower.

747
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:26,464
However,
although he already had

748
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:29,024
a Formula One
world title to his name,

749
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:33,424
the Scotsman's CV cut no ice
with the sniffy Indy officials

750
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,384
who made the upstart
from across the pond

751
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:39,824
take a rookie driving test
before he could compete.

752
00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:45,224
Come Indy weekend,

753
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:47,264
the upstart
from across the pond

754
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:50,119
qualified on the front row.

755
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:52,824
And then...

756
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:55,984
in the race itself...

757
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:59,904
Clark, up against
America's finest oval racers,

758
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:04,319
won by just over two minutes.

759
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:14,944
Jim Clark, first European
to win at Indianapolis since 1916,

760
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:19,744
set a new record
of 150.686 miles per hour.

761
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:23,544
So, what was it
that made Clark so good?

762
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:29,399
What was it that made him capable
of winning in any type of car?

763
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:33,304
Jimmy was an absolute
natural driver,

764
00:43:33,389 --> 00:43:35,024
and he did it
without thinking.

765
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:37,224
He didn't know
why he was driving

766
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:39,264
in this style the way he did.

767
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:44,784
In the period
that we're talking about,

768
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:48,104
we had one and a half-litre
cars, 200 horsepower.

769
00:43:48,189 --> 00:43:52,024
If you drove the car too hard
you would scrub the speed off

770
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:54,944
and if you lose
a bit of speed,

771
00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:57,024
it's very difficult to
actually make it up again.

772
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:58,664
And that's what Jimmy had,

773
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:01,944
the knack of keeping the
momentum of the car going.

774
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:04,864
I don't think that any
of the modern drivers

775
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:09,864
could have driven the car anywhere
near as quickly as Jimmy did,

776
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:12,639
because he was
just so precise.

777
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:21,904
Besides a supernatural
ability to coax speed out of the car,

778
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:25,784
Clark also possessed
another vital skill.

779
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,784
A lot of
very good racing drivers

780
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,784
died in Lotuses,

781
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:33,824
because the Lotus
was a very fragile car.

782
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:37,224
But Jim Clark was so smooth

783
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:40,024
that he never put
too much stress

784
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:43,144
on the areas of a car
that would give up.

785
00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:46,544
In Barcelona, in practice...

786
00:44:46,629 --> 00:44:48,424
he came in after ten laps.

787
00:44:48,509 --> 00:44:50,144
We'd done ten. He said,

788
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,824
"There's something
on the left rear."

789
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:53,584
Something, something.

790
00:44:53,669 --> 00:44:56,664
"I can feel something on the left rear.
It's... it's not right."

791
00:44:56,749 --> 00:44:58,904
We looked over,
we checked everything.

792
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:00,664
Everything felt good.

793
00:45:00,749 --> 00:45:02,544
He said, "No, there's
something wrong."

794
00:45:02,629 --> 00:45:08,064
So, that night I took the left
rear suspension to pieces,

795
00:45:08,149 --> 00:45:10,784
and lo and behold
one of the wheel bearings

796
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:14,184
has just started to wear.

797
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:17,944
I don't know how anybody could
ever feel that. But he did.

798
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:21,184
After the race,
when you stripped his car down,

799
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:24,384
and you stripped
his co-driver's car down,

800
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:26,264
you could always tell
which parts

801
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:27,944
came off Jimmy's car

802
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:29,264
and which parts came off

803
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:30,864
the other driver's car.

804
00:45:30,949 --> 00:45:33,764
Because the parts
off Jimmy's car

805
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:36,399
were more or less pristine.

806
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:39,444
But don't think for a minute

807
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:41,304
that Clark
was one of those drivers

808
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:44,959
that could only win
in a perfect car.

809
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:48,424
One year at Spa, for example,

810
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:52,839
he was leading the race when
his gearbox started to let go.

811
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:56,424
Did he give up? Nope.

812
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:58,504
Instead, he drove
the rest of the race,

813
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,544
and we're talking 160 miles
an hour in the wet...

814
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:04,464
with one hand
on the steering wheel

815
00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:08,239
and the other holding
the gear lever in place.

816
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,879
And he still won.

817
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:20,599
By nearly five minutes.

818
00:46:36,389 --> 00:46:39,584
As the 1965 season rolled on,

819
00:46:39,669 --> 00:46:42,864
Clark, having won both
Formula Two championships,

820
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:45,664
the Tasman Series,

821
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:47,624
and the Indy 500,

822
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:51,704
now faced
one remaining challenge.

823
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:55,184
The biggest challenge,
the Formula One world title.

824
00:46:59,909 --> 00:47:02,424
For the F1 races,
Clark would be driving

825
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:05,224
a modified version
of the Lotus 25 -

826
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:06,904
the car that had taken him

827
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:09,959
to the World Championship
two years earlier.

828
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,064
But as amazing as the 25 was,

829
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:17,064
there was no
getting round the fact

830
00:47:17,149 --> 00:47:21,664
that by 1965 it was
a three-year-old design,

831
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:25,664
and the updated version
only had minor changes.

832
00:47:25,749 --> 00:47:27,919
So how would Jim cope?

833
00:47:31,229 --> 00:47:34,704
At the season's
opening race in South Africa,

834
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:36,224
up against such legends

835
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:38,584
as Jack Brabham, Graham Hill,

836
00:47:38,669 --> 00:47:42,824
and reigning World Champion
John Surtees...

837
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:45,984
Clark won
by half a minute,

838
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:50,759
and did so while suffering
from a slipped disc.

839
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:54,064
Next up was Spa,

840
00:47:54,149 --> 00:47:56,584
and then
the French Grand Prix:

841
00:47:56,669 --> 00:48:00,904
both of which he also won.

842
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:03,704
His Lotus may be
a car with an old engine,

843
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:05,504
but as far as the
opposition are concerned,

844
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:08,544
it is just
out-distancing all.

845
00:48:08,629 --> 00:48:12,559
Behind the wheel,
Clark was becoming untouchable.

846
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:17,544
Jimmy would go out beginning
of the practice session

847
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:20,384
and do
a very, very quick lap.

848
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:22,504
And come back,
sit on the wall.

849
00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:25,144
You know, there's no point
in wearing the car out.

850
00:48:25,229 --> 00:48:27,824
And then wait and see
what everybody else has done,

851
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:29,839
and go out and blitz it.

852
00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:33,144
If he wasn't
on pole position,

853
00:48:33,229 --> 00:48:35,264
there was a problem
with the car.

854
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:37,144
Next up was Silverstone.

855
00:48:37,229 --> 00:48:40,424
And here, it looked like
business as usual

856
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:43,744
with Clark
leading the pack.

857
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:46,664
However,
in the closing stages,

858
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:50,004
his engine was starting
to lose oil pressure

859
00:48:50,089 --> 00:48:54,304
and was in danger of detonating
under cornering G-forces.

860
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:57,464
While Clark is driving
with no oil pressure on his gauge,

861
00:48:57,549 --> 00:48:59,344
Hill, storming up behind,
breaks the lap record

862
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:00,864
in his efforts to pass.

863
00:49:00,949 --> 00:49:03,864
So instead of driving the car
through the corner

864
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:06,744
he just switched it off,
coasted through the corner.

865
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:09,304
When he was through the corner,
switched it back on again,

866
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:12,559
did the rest of the lap -
and he won the race.

867
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:17,904
Eventually, the F1 circus

868
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,624
arrived at the Nurburgring,

869
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:22,864
a circuit where Clark
had never won.

870
00:49:22,949 --> 00:49:25,464
For the Flying Scot,
tense moments before the start.

871
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:26,904
Victory in
the German Grand Prix

872
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:28,784
and he'd be World Champion.

873
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:37,264
Leading from pole,

874
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,704
Clark finally broke
his Nurburgring jinx,

875
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:42,704
winning the race,
and with it

876
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:46,199
the Formula One
world title.

877
00:49:55,149 --> 00:49:59,224
So, let's just sum up
Clark's season of 1965.

878
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:01,704
Of the 63 races he contested,

879
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:04,464
he won
a staggering 31 of them,

880
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:07,464
and was on the podium
a further eight times.

881
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:11,024
He was now seen as the greatest
racing driver of all time,

882
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:13,464
in demand the world over.

883
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:15,384
Yet this shy Scotsman

884
00:50:15,469 --> 00:50:17,784
chose to mark
the year's achievements

885
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:21,104
with a modest celebration
at his hometown

886
00:50:21,189 --> 00:50:23,719
back in Scotland.

887
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:39,264
The next two years by
contrast were a disaster,

888
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:41,724
with multiple
mechanical failures

889
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:44,359
denying him
another championship.

890
00:50:51,229 --> 00:50:54,064
However, in 1968,

891
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:55,944
driving the Lotus 49,

892
00:50:56,029 --> 00:50:58,584
another game-changer
from Colin Chapman,

893
00:50:58,669 --> 00:51:03,064
Clark took the first win of
the year in South Africa

894
00:51:03,149 --> 00:51:06,744
and looked set for
another dominant season.

895
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:09,584
Congratulations, Jim, this was
an absolutely splendid effort.

896
00:51:09,669 --> 00:51:10,904
OK, thank you very much.

897
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:13,704
And then, on the weekend
of April the 7th,

898
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:16,904
Clark had a choice of two
races he could compete in,

899
00:51:16,989 --> 00:51:18,344
one at Brands Hatch,

900
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:21,624
the other a Formula Two race
at Hockenheim.

901
00:51:21,709 --> 00:51:25,279
Fatefully, he entered
the German race.

902
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:33,584
April the 7th is a...
is a bad day for me.

903
00:51:33,669 --> 00:51:35,464
He wasn't happy.

904
00:51:35,549 --> 00:51:39,144
It was freezing cold
and damp... misty.

905
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:42,824
We could not get any heat
into the tyres.

906
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:46,624
Couldn't get any temperature
in them no matter what we did.

907
00:51:46,709 --> 00:51:48,144
Jimmy said to me
before the race:

908
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:50,184
"Do not expect
anything from me today.

909
00:51:50,269 --> 00:51:55,839
Just keep me informed with the pit
board where I am, how many laps to go."

910
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,818
That's the last thing
he said.

911
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:16,544
On lap five, Clark's car
suddenly speared off the track

912
00:52:16,629 --> 00:52:19,719
at 170 miles an hour.

913
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:26,188
I got to the scene, and they took me
through the undergrowth to this...

914
00:52:26,274 --> 00:52:29,629
There's no Armco.
There's Tarmac, trees.

915
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:30,899
Literally.

916
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:32,804
And the sheer path.

917
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:36,679
And I just saw
what was left of a car... Oh.

918
00:52:39,549 --> 00:52:41,384
There was nothing to see.

919
00:52:41,469 --> 00:52:43,984
I said, "Where's the engine
gearbox? What's going on?"

920
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:46,224
What's happened?"
They said, "That's..."

921
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:50,384
It was about 35 yards away
through the saplings.

922
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:52,544
It just cut
the saplings down.

923
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:56,599
And I said, "Where's, where's the driver?
Where's Jimmy?" They said, "No."

924
00:52:58,337 --> 00:53:01,907
When you've just... lost...

925
00:53:02,709 --> 00:53:04,464
the best driver
in the world,

926
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:06,396
what the hell do you do?

927
00:53:07,949 --> 00:53:09,984
Jim Clark, he's a god.

928
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:12,344
And the first time I saw him,
my God, it's...

929
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:15,224
I can't believe it. And you're
actually talking to him.

930
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:17,624
It was awe-inspiring.

931
00:53:17,709 --> 00:53:20,839
Life is worth living.

932
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:24,896
It's...

933
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:28,119
for me, it's tearful.

934
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:31,149
I'm sorry.

935
00:53:35,029 --> 00:53:37,424
According
to the medical report,

936
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:40,584
Clark died instantly
of a broken neck

937
00:53:40,669 --> 00:53:44,984
and the crash was later
put down to a deflating tyre.

938
00:53:45,069 --> 00:53:48,704
When he died, he was just 32.

939
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:54,879
But in his short career he had racked
up some truly incredible achievements.

940
00:53:55,721 --> 00:53:59,796
In Formula One,
he won 25 of his 73 races,

941
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,826
which in percentage terms puts
him way ahead of Hamilton, Vettel,

942
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:05,227
and even Schumacher.

943
00:54:05,313 --> 00:54:07,308
In pole positions, he had 33.

944
00:54:07,394 --> 00:54:08,949
Which again,
in percentage terms,

945
00:54:09,149 --> 00:54:11,584
makes him
second best of all time,

946
00:54:11,669 --> 00:54:13,944
just behind Fangio.

947
00:54:14,029 --> 00:54:15,504
Then there are
the Grand Slams:

948
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:19,144
that's where a driver gets
pole position, fastest lap,

949
00:54:19,229 --> 00:54:22,504
the win and leads
every lap of the race.

950
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:25,544
Schumacher has five
Grand Slams to his name.

951
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,184
Senna, four.

952
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:29,624
Jim Clark, eight.

953
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:33,039
That's more than
any other driver in history.

954
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:37,904
You might imagine
that a man with such skills

955
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:40,744
would be rated highly
by other drivers.

956
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:43,304
And you'd be right.

957
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:46,344
I was invited to
a cocktail party for Fangio,

958
00:54:46,429 --> 00:54:49,744
and he said to me,
"In my opinion,

959
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:53,064
Jimmy Clark was the
greatest racing driver ever."

960
00:54:53,149 --> 00:54:55,104
And coming from Fangio,

961
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:58,264
there's no better
compliment than that.

962
00:54:58,349 --> 00:55:00,464
And the five-time
World Champion

963
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:02,664
was not the only
South American

964
00:55:02,749 --> 00:55:05,279
who idolised the Scotsman.

965
00:55:06,589 --> 00:55:08,784
At Clark's old school
in Edinburgh,

966
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:12,704
there's a plaque commemorating
his achievements.

967
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:16,384
And in 1991,
the reigning World Champion

968
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:19,264
made a special pilgrimage
to the school

969
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:23,024
to pay his respects.

970
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:27,424
Of Clark, Senna said simply,
"He was my boyhood hero.

971
00:55:27,509 --> 00:55:30,744
He was the best of the best."

972
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:34,104
And like Senna, Clark died
when he was driving

973
00:55:34,189 --> 00:55:36,389
at his absolute peak.

974
00:55:36,537 --> 00:55:39,784
Like Senna, who knows
how many more races

975
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:43,239
and championships
he could have racked up?

976
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:52,622
He was the benchmark.
That was it.

977
00:55:52,754 --> 00:55:57,069
Most of what I was able to do
in motor racing was done...

978
00:55:57,232 --> 00:56:00,027
by the manner in
which Jim Clark drove,

979
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:02,719
and... I just followed him.

980
00:56:03,448 --> 00:56:05,163
He was a gentleman.

981
00:56:05,787 --> 00:56:08,818
He was a gentleman,
and a gentle man.

982
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:11,759
It's a pity he's not
around now, because...

983
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:15,719
it'd be nice to have him.

984
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:25,784
He was
an amazing man.

985
00:56:25,869 --> 00:56:29,068
- Just incredible.
- All of that's amazing.

986
00:56:29,154 --> 00:56:30,344
Yeah.

987
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,144
What I find truly amazing

988
00:56:32,229 --> 00:56:35,131
is how many championships
he took part in.

989
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:37,784
I mean, can you imagine
Lewis Hamilton

990
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:39,712
getting out of his
Formula One car and saying,

991
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:41,024
"I haven't got time
for any interviews,

992
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:43,009
cos I've got to go and
do a touring car race."

993
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:44,504
- Just wouldn't.
- And he did.

994
00:56:44,589 --> 00:56:46,915
The other thing worth remembering
is back in the early '60s,

995
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:50,756
if you went to Australia, if you flew
to Australia that meant eight stops.

996
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:53,631
And there were no flat beds.
There weren't even any movies.

997
00:56:53,717 --> 00:56:56,564
And let's not forget
he'd get off that aeroplane,

998
00:56:56,649 --> 00:56:58,504
do a race, win it -
obviously,

999
00:56:58,589 --> 00:57:01,162
then get on another aeroplane
straight away to France

1000
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:03,865
- to win a race there.
- No, it is astonishing.

1001
00:57:03,951 --> 00:57:05,951
I mean, everybody has
a favourite racing driver.

1002
00:57:06,037 --> 00:57:08,146
I'm sure everybody here
does as well.

1003
00:57:08,232 --> 00:57:10,224
It's, you know, it's the
Senna, Schumacher,

1004
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:12,184
Villeneuve,
Romain Grosjean...

1005
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:14,464
Fangio.

1006
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:18,184
But if you use maths to
measure a driver's greatness,

1007
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:22,124
you have to conclude
it was Jim Clark.

1008
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:24,146
