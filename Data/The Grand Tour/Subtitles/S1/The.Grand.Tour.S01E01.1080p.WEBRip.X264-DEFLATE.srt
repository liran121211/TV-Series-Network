1
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,796
According to today's
newspaper headlines,

2
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,864
it seems that it's
the end of the road

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,467
for motoring presenter
Jeremy Clarkson...

4
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:37,805
...and said that
it's with deep regret

5
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:40,374
the decision had been taken
not to renew him.

6
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,418
..forecast plenty of sunshine
through today

7
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,887
with seasonal temperatures.

8
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:30,791
We should reach a high of
about 82 degrees by this
afternoon...

9
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,393
Hello, everybody!

10
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,365
Hello.
That was the Hothouse Flowers.

11
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:59,400
And now,
look what we have here.

12
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,605
He was born--

13
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:08,108
He was born in 1836...

14
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,680
He was fired by Car magazine,

15
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,115
fired by Autocar magazine,

16
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,451
fired by Scotland On Sunday,

17
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,388
and somehow he managed
to get fired

18
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:23,256
by a Volvo dealership.

19
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,625
Thank you.

20
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,727
Probably for driving
too slowly.

21
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,863
Ladies and gentlemen,
James May!

22
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,172
Thank you, thank you.
You're very kind.

23
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,443
And, ladies and gentlemen,

24
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:46,213
you probably can't see him
from the back,

25
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:50,684
but I assure you
he is here.

26
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,987
He was fired by Radio York,

27
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,823
fired by Radio Leeds,

28
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,158
and fired by Radio Lancashire,

29
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,093
it's Richard Hammond!

30
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,464
Hello! Hello! Thank you!

31
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,600
Thank you.

32
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,438
And, ladies and gentlemen!

33
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,042
Over here!

34
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:18,679
He's-- He's basically

35
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,516
a shaved ape in a shirt.

36
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:26,454
And he, technically,
is the only one of us

37
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,522
never to be fired by anyone.

38
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,458
It's Jeremy Clarkson!

39
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,127
Thank you so much.

40
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,999
And the good thing is,

41
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,670
it's very unlikely
I'm going to be fired now,

42
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,473
because we're on the Internet,

43
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:47,374
which means
I could pleasure a horse.

44
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,477
No! No.

45
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:50,844
- Dog?
- No.

46
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,580
No pleasuring of any sort.

47
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,483
- There are families watching.
- Yes!

48
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:59,152
Anyway, we are all
car journalists.

49
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,490
And we have spent
the last 20 years...

50
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,793
- Being fired.
- Yes.

51
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,661
But we have poured
everything we know,

52
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:11,298
everything we care about,
into this show.

53
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:18,038
Everything. And coming up now
is a small montage

54
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,875
of what you can expect
over the next 12 weeks.

55
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,253
Are we ready, gentlemen?

56
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,523
Honestly, I don't know.

57
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,065
Argh!

58
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,535
Is that the size of the drop
or what's happened to his penis?

59
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:52,339
You're looking
at magnificence.

60
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,642
Help! This is bad.

61
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,813
James says we've got
to stop for fuel.

62
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:07,555
I hate you!

63
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,590
He doesn't like us.

64
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,830
Bloody Nora!

65
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,173
May be leaking slightly.

66
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,241
What a moron.

67
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,713
You sunk my limousine!

68
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,983
I've lost one of
my nose tampons.

69
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:40,387
This is not a particularly
cultural thing to do.

70
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:44,324
I don't like the smell
of tire smoke in the evening.

71
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,259
Oi! Get back in!

72
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,596
James is falling...

73
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,706
Sideways in linen.

74
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,385
There's no dignity in that,
is there?

75
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,321
No.

76
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,227
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

77
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,062
Now-- Thank you.

78
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,634
All of that is gonna
be hosted from this.

79
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:30,103
This is our new
travelling studio tent.

80
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,506
Thank you so much.
We're gonna be roaming
the world in it.

81
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,975
We're gonna be like gypsies.

82
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,078
Only the cars we drive
are gonna be insured.

83
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,447
Stop saying things
that are gonna get us fired.

84
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,482
But I'm just saying,
it's brilliant.

85
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,685
It is.

86
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,489
Oi! Who shot our drone?

87
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,459
- Did someone shoot it?
- Him.

88
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,395
Let's not get bogged down
in who shot what, okay?

89
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,498
Let's get changed
and get on with the show.

90
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,668
Shall we get on
with the show?

91
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,335
Let's do it.

92
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,958
Thank you, everybody!

93
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,894
Thank you so much.

94
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:31,364
And welcome
to the first ever Grand Tour.

95
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:40,573
Thank you. Now, we hope
you like our tent.

96
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,377
We think the great thing
is that because it roams
around the world,

97
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,715
we get a different view
out of the big picture
windows every week.

98
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,750
So this week,
obviously we've got

99
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,118
the high desert
of California.

100
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:54,254
- Next week, who knows?
- I do.

101
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:58,325
Well, yes, James, we know.
It's Johannesburg.

102
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,729
- Now they know.
- I know they know!
It doesn't matter!

103
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,765
The point is the view changes
and so does the audience, okay?

104
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:07,267
This week
you're all Americans.

105
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,077
Now, this is a bit
of a problem

106
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:20,113
for people like us
who speak English.

107
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:24,351
We can converse perfectly well
in a shop or a restaurant,

108
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,054
but when it comes
to cars and motoring,

109
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,857
every single word you use
is different.

110
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:33,160
When I say "different,"
I mean "wrong."

111
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,562
When you change gear
with a lever,
what do you call that?

112
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,131
- Stick.
- Stick.

113
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,133
Now, you see,
this is a stick.

114
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,402
Couldn't change gear
with this.

115
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,105
Wouldn't work.
What you can do with this
is point at things.

116
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,140
Let's see
if we can get you educated.

117
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,109
What do you call
this bit of a car?

118
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:52,145
- The hood!
- Bonnet.

119
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,681
- Bonnet.
- They're learning.

120
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,785
What do you mean?
I know you can wear
a bonnet on your head.

121
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:02,455
It's two things.
We're capable of having
those different thoughts.

122
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,892
- What type
of vehicle is this?
Pick-up.

123
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,493
No, it's stupid.

124
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,797
- Oh, now, hang on.
- It is stupid.

125
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:12,132
Let's do another one of these.

126
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:16,036
- What type
of vehicle is this?
Coupe.

127
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:20,073
Coupe? Coop is where
you keep your chickens.

128
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,342
That's a coupé.
That's a French word, I admit.

129
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,511
- Yeah, a bit.
- They're muddled with that.

130
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,280
George Bush, have you heard what
he once said about the French?

131
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,082
"The trouble with the French is
they have no word

132
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,851
for entrepreneur."

133
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,421
It is difficult. I think
the only thing we agree on

134
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,656
- is "steering wheel."
- Yeah.

135
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:40,861
But then they go and put it
on the wrong side of the car.

136
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:45,298
It must be really annoying
having to drive along
like that all the time.

137
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:49,002
Why don't you just put it
in front of the driver
like we do?

138
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,438
It's probably a good idea
if we get on with
the actual show.

139
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,841
Yes, it is. But we had
to clear all that up,

140
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,176
because contrary to what
some people have been saying,

141
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,578
this actually is a car show.

142
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,314
- Well, not next week it isn't.
- Next week is an exception.

143
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,116
- Yeah.
- But not when we go
to Barbados either.

144
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,152
No, Barbados is definitely
another exception.

145
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:08,989
But tonight couldn't be
more "car-y" if it tried.

146
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,159
I'm gonna prove that point
because we're kicking off
with this.

147
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:19,132
Bear with me, bear with me--

148
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,935
I agree!

149
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,103
The thing is, though,

150
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,505
various supercar makers
have now taken

151
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:29,342
the polar-bear-friendly
technology from a Prius,

152
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:33,146
and they are now using it
to create raw, naked speed.

153
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,416
Now, I say the best
of these hybrid hypercars

154
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:40,787
is the mad,
swivel-eyed McLaren P1.

155
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,890
Whereas Richard Hammond,
who's wrong--

156
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,991
I'm not wrong.

157
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,259
He is, because he says
the best

158
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,462
is actually the rather
boring Porsche 918.

159
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,999
- It's not boring!
- Yes, it is.

160
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,001
- It isn't.
- Mm-hmm.

161
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,535
It isn't.
Well, whatever.

162
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:59,106
We decided to meet up
with the cars

163
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,574
and settle this
once and for all.

164
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:04,237
The location we chose
for this titanic duel
was Portugal...

165
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:09,176
specifically,
the international
race track of the Algarve.

166
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,318
When we arrived,
mechanics from Porsche

167
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,453
and McLaren pounced on
our cars,

168
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,523
fettling them for
what was to come.

169
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,593
And this meant Hammond and I
had some time to indulge

170
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,597
in a spot
of childish point scoring.

171
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,833
Which one of these is going
to be the fastest around
this track?

172
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,235
- This?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,537
Apart from this one,
which will be faster.

174
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,173
It won't. Which one do you
think will be the fastest?

175
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,109
- This one.
- This one.

176
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:45,412
Porsche think the Porsche
will be fastest.
McLaren say the McLaren.

177
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,547
How much is it
if I wanted to buy one?

178
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,583
I think one was sold in
an auction for 1.8 million.

179
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,621
1.8 million dollars.
Hammond, how much is yours?

180
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,623
838 euros.

181
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,492
- Thousand I'm guessing?
- Yes. It is thousands.

182
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,362
Why has your car
got a number on the side?

183
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,397
It's the Weissach edition,
this one.

184
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,433
- You also get
titanium chassis bolts.
- Stupid.

185
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,568
For just an extra £60,000.

186
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,405
And a carbon-fiber
bonnet strut.

187
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,806
Look at that.
How much does that save?

188
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,244
- About 100 grams.
- Right there, 100 grams.

189
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,779
Has the McLaren got
a carbon-fiber bonnet strut?

190
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,150
- Doesn't need one.
- No, because my bonnet
doesn't go up

191
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,552
because it will never
break down.

192
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,488
And it's got silly doors.
Proper doors, silly doors.

193
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,125
Mine does 34 miles
to the gallon.

194
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,394
This does 94.

195
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,529
- 94 miles to the gallon?
- 94mpg.

196
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,731
Just remind me,
Porsche is owned by?

197
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,667
That'll be Volkswagen.

198
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:50,877
Soon the McLaren and
the Porsche were ready
for some shakedown laps.

199
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,151
And for these we decided
we'd drive each other's cars.

200
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,291
Straight away,
I can tell you

201
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,760
that this doesn't have
the brutality or the savagery

202
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,697
of the McLaren.

203
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,734
Because it has rear-wheel
steering and four-wheel drive,

204
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,637
it feels secure and safe.

205
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,839
And that gives you
the confidence--

206
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,411
...to play about.

207
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,591
If I went round this corner
this fast in the McLaren...

208
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,463
...a lot of poo would come out.

209
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,239
Whoa! There's poo
coming out now!

210
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,476
Jesus.

211
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,414
It's spinning its
wheels in sixth!

212
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,821
This is frightening,
that's what it is.

213
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:14,161
Whoa! More poo.

214
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:18,331
I didn't think it was possible
to shit yourself to death.

215
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:35,182
The grip is genuinely
incredible.

216
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,021
Oh, there you go.

217
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:45,192
In the savage
and unforgiving P1,

218
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,194
my nerves were shot
to pieces.

219
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:50,763
But I, too, was falling
in love.

220
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,366
903 horsepower.

221
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,837
Oh, my God!

222
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,209
Oh, you bad, bad,
naughty car!

223
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,481
Jesus.

224
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,852
This recalibrates
your mind.

225
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:16,088
I didn't think anything
could be as exciting
as that Porsche,

226
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,691
but this-- this is.

227
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,397
This is brilliant.

228
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:30,002
Absolutely brilliant.

229
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,038
Oh.

230
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,073
What a car.

231
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,575
I love it.

232
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:41,080
- Well?
- This is rubbish!

233
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,450
I was just thinking exactly
the same about this.

234
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,151
- Were you?
- This was boring me to death.

235
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:49,656
It was like being stuck
in a Victorian woman's novel.

236
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:53,526
I'd rather that than being
stuck in a telephone box
with a panicking gorilla.

237
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,562
- Rubbish.
- It was trying to kill me.

238
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,597
- It wants to hurt me.
- That's why I like it.

239
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,899
This is
a missionary-position car.

240
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,968
Razor blade
in the hands of a surgeon.

241
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,238
Sickle in the hands
of a drunk peasant.

242
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:08,908
Downton Abbey. Breaking Bad.
That's crystal meth.

243
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,577
That's some iffy weed.

244
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:14,213
Fine wine.
Crate of Newcy Brown.

245
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:18,318
Schooner of sherry.
Absinthe.

246
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,086
James Bond specifying

247
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,121
his martini to be shaken
not stirred.

248
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,656
Begbie in Trainspotting

249
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,458
lobbing a pint pot over
his shoulder in a night club

250
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,261
and starting a bar fight.
What?

251
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,834
Hi.

252
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,669
What are you doing here?

253
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,705
I'm here because, gentlemen,

254
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,740
I have in the back
of that lorry

255
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,576
something that will make
your McLaren and your Porsche

256
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,978
look like lumps of yesteryear.

257
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,875
I cannot remember
the last time a car,

258
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,777
or, indeed,
any sort of thing,

259
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,580
gave me a fizz like
the Ferrari LaFerrari.

260
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:25,385
This has 950 horsepower.

261
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:26,886
950.

262
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,189
More than either
of the other two.

263
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,992
And it's lighter.
It weighs 1,250 kilograms.

264
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:38,898
Which is less
than most hatchbacks.

265
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,870
Actually there is a bit more
to the Ferrari LaFerrari,

266
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,675
because what it has is,
in effect, a formula one
KERS system.

267
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:53,546
It constantly recovers energy
that would otherwise be lost

268
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,948
using its electric motor
and its battery.

269
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,751
So as I brake there,

270
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:02,622
the car is actually saying,
"That energy, I'll have that."

271
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,825
Straight!

272
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:10,630
This is what 950 horsepower
feels like!

273
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,437
Jesus!

274
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,678
This I believe will absolutely
mince the other two.

275
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,580
Oh, man!

276
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:32,485
James was obviously
talking nonsense.

277
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,787
But there's no getting
around the fact

278
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,023
that these three cars
take automotive science

279
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,958
to a new level.

280
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,963
They use
the latest green technology

281
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,733
to squeeze
as much speed as possible

282
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,536
from every molecule of fuel.

283
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,240
As a result, they're
all capable of blasting

284
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,676
way past 200 miles an hour

285
00:22:56,676 --> 00:23:00,947
whilst producing fewer
harmful emissions
than a family saloon.

286
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:11,057
What we have here, then,
are three incredible machines

287
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,892
which, at a stroke,

288
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,128
have made the traditional
supercar look wooden...

289
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,064
and old-fashioned.

290
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:24,637
Welcome, everyone,
to the hypercar holy trinity.

291
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,745
In that door mirror
I have a £1 million Porsche.

292
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,883
In that door mirror
I have a £1 million Ferrari.

293
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,820
What a toy box today.

294
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,796
Sparks from Jezzer.

295
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,204
I don't think so, Hammond.

296
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,880
This could be so expensive.

297
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,759
It's going to boost.

298
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,128
Pushing the IPAS button!

299
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:26,132
And that gives me
another 170 horsepower.

300
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,737
Opening DRS!

301
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,541
Oh, my Christ!

302
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,909
Bloody...

303
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,746
And here comes May
in the Ferrari LaFerrari.

304
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,954
Concentrating.
Concentrating.

305
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,234
Oh-oh! That bloody car

306
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,236
is trying to kill me,
and I'm not even in it.

307
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,908
Ha-ha!

308
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:22,454
We could have played
out there all day,

309
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:26,092
but before we ended up
in a £3 million crash,

310
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:28,127
we decided to start
the tests

311
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,963
to see which
of the cars was best.

312
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,632
I came up with the first one,

313
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:36,102
mainly to annoy
gate-crasher May.

314
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:39,105
Let's make the first test
a drag race

315
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:43,042
- using electrical power only.
- Good idea.

316
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,778
- It isn't a good idea.
- Why not?

317
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:48,615
Because you can't drive
the Ferrari on electrical
power only.

318
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:51,618
- No!
- Of course you can't,

319
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,686
because it's a KERS system
like a Formula One car.

320
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,623
It's got a V12 engine
and an electric motor,

321
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:59,391
but they are integrated,
they work together,
you can't separate them.

322
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,129
- You should have thought
about that, shouldn't you?
- Bad planning.

323
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,634
With James reduced
to the role of onlooker,

324
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:11,170
we lined up the P1 and
the 918 on the start line,

325
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,274
but then, instead of
revving the petrol engines,

326
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,644
we shut them down.

327
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:23,883
That is weird.

328
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:27,186
Preparing to start a drag race

329
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,555
in complete silence.

330
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,191
I still have
two electric motors

331
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:35,527
that together produce
285 brake horsepower

332
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,163
which is 109 more

333
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:42,301
than the one electric motor
in his McLaren. Oh, yeah.

334
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,847
I'm outta here!

335
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,483
You've got to love that,
the immediate power

336
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,919
from an electrical engine.

337
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,956
That is 70 miles an hour
already and it isn't enough.

338
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,772
Who won that?
It was me, wasn't it?

339
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:21,808
Yeah, but it's not
important though, is it?

340
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,575
- Is it not?
- It's just not relevant.

341
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,177
Right, right.

342
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,880
In a drag race, it's irrelevant
which car gets there first?

343
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,117
Yeah, yours is
the better milk float.

344
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:38,024
Back in the pits, Hammond had
an idea for the next test.

345
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:41,227
We've got to drive
to the hotel yet.
It's about an hour away.

346
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:43,730
It gives us a chance to see
what they're like on the road.

347
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,165
- That's a good point.
- Real world.

348
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,235
- That is a good point.
- I can't do that.

349
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,270
I can't drive the Ferrari
on the road.

350
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,605
- Why?
- It's not registered.

351
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,341
It is,
it's got number plates.

352
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,209
No, that's just pretend
number plates.

353
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,145
If they register it,
it becomes second-hand

354
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,947
and they pay tax. That's
why it came in the lorry.

355
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:02,982
So you can't drive it
on the road either?

356
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,017
Nobody can drive it.
It's not road legal.

357
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,754
- Oh, no.
- Mate, that's...

358
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:10,356
- That is such a shame.
- It's an hour of--

359
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,491
That's really a rotten bit
of luck.

360
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,626
'Cause you've come a long way
from Italy.

361
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,495
I can't give you a lift

362
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,365
'cause the soundman's headphones
are on the seat and the mixer.

363
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,167
Oh, no.

364
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,069
There's literally
nothing I can do.

365
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,307
Soon Richard
and I were enjoying

366
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:31,778
the world's
best-ever commute.

367
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,253
It may be a bit Spartan
in here,

368
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,790
but it's unbelievably
comfortable.

369
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,960
Because it uses electronics

370
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,229
rather than traditional
anti-roll bars.

371
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,464
That means there's
no physical connection

372
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,300
between the wheels.

373
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,437
So if one goes over a bump
the others aren't affected.

374
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:01,473
It's uncanny. It's like being
in a Rolls-Royce Phantom.

375
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,714
It's a lovely evening.
Taken the roof panels out.

376
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,817
Set the air-con just so.

377
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,919
And I'm enjoying
a drive in the country.

378
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,467
Meanwhile...

379
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:06,272
Oh, bloody hell.

380
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,210
You're all right.

381
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,679
You're all right,
in Italian.

382
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,390
Oh, God.

383
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,331
- James.
- What?

384
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,902
I'm sorry to have to say this,
but that Ferrari is useless.

385
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:38,637
Yes, yes, yes.
Later on in part two,

386
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,940
when these two have stopped
dreaming up

387
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,641
idiotic and irrelevant tests

388
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:46,478
that it can't take part in,
we shall see.

389
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,314
Fair enough. Now,

390
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,816
at this point in the show
we like to sit down

391
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:54,286
and chew the fat about new
cars and motoring issues.

392
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:57,990
Like, for example,
why in Britain we have
to drive at 50 miles an hour

393
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,627
when they're doing roadworks
to protect the workforce
which is never there.

394
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:03,329
Yes, okay...

395
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,331
And why fully-grown adults

396
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:08,767
have taken to riding around
the city on children's toys?

397
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,270
- Yes, okay.
- I think they're
called bicycles.

398
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,839
- Is that the right word?
- It's issues like that.

399
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,209
It's a segment we are calling
Conversation Street.

400
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,653
- Well...
- What?

401
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:32,024
We put a lot of work into that!

402
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:35,962
It was really,
really hard doing that.

403
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:39,365
Better than that, rather
brilliantly, we have made

404
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,733
a bespoke version
of that sting

405
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,269
for every single episode

406
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,504
we're gonna make
for the next three years.

407
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:47,539
How about that?

408
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,877
But hold on.
The slight problem with that

409
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,712
is that we were
so busy doing that

410
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,682
we didn't think actually
of anything to talk about.

411
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,517
- We did.
- Yeah.

412
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,752
- What?
- You'll love this.

413
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:06,658
James May, the world's
slowest moving human being,

414
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:10,029
has been caught speeding.

415
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:14,500
Actually charged
by the police.

416
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,169
Criminal.

417
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,704
He's actually quite proud of it.

418
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:22,208
He did it on a Honda
CBR 600RR sports bike.

419
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,177
The thing was...

420
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,316
Richard and I were
genuinely astonished.

421
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:31,750
He came into the office
and said,

422
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,153
"I've been done
for speeding."

423
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:37,123
Until we found out
how fast he was going.

424
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,558
James, how fast was it again?

425
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,161
37 miles an hour.

426
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:45,397
Crazy! Mad man!

427
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:48,467
How did you even breathe
at that kind of speed?

428
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,503
How did the police catch you?
Were they running?

429
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:55,374
Gentle jog for sure.

430
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,409
The thing is,
if you've been caught,

431
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,778
'cause we genuinely don't
believe anyone in the world has,

432
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:04,583
but if you've been caught
speeding at a speed less
than 37,

433
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,653
do honestly please write
to us and let us know.

434
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,688
'Cause we don't think
it's possible.

435
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,458
And mark your envelope,
"I'm a tortoise."

436
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,660
And that is all
we have time for this week

437
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,095
on Conversation Street.

438
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,463
- Whoa! Hang on a minute.
- What?

439
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:18,830
The first-ever show,
and you just mock me

440
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,300
for my speeding ticket
and then we move on?

441
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,302
It's a busy show.

442
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:26,372
It is a busy show.
We've got to tell everyone
about our track.

443
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:29,441
Yes, we have one.

444
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:32,378
This is the sort of place
where you can drive cars

445
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:34,346
at speeds that you can do
on the road

446
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,948
but only if you want
to go to prison afterwards.

447
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,750
What, like 38 miles an hour?

448
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,454
39 maybe even,
40 from time to time.

449
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,423
Now, we were hoping
that we could bring it

450
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:46,425
round the world with us
like the tent.

451
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:50,229
But unfortunately
it's too heavy,

452
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:53,099
and, as you are about to see,
too bitey.

453
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,905
This is it.

454
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,740
It's not a race circuit.

455
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,843
It's not an airfield.

456
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,379
It's not a road.

457
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,716
What it is
is brilliant and fast.

458
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,120
And extremely dangerous.

459
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,823
It even looks dangerous
on a map.

460
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:21,160
Because as you can see,
it's the exact same shape

461
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,295
as the Ebola virus.

462
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:29,635
Right, time now to show you
what a lap looks like.

463
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:33,139
To do that we've got a bit of
a performance benchmark.

464
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,141
A Ferrari 488.

465
00:34:35,141 --> 00:34:37,143
Take it away.

466
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:40,779
Take it away.

467
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,951
First up,
it's the Isn't Straight,

468
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:49,455
so called because
it isn't straight.

469
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:53,959
There is a super-fast left
followed by a super-fast right.

470
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:57,863
And if you make a mistake,
there's no run-off area
or Armco.

471
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:01,167
It's just woods.

472
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,169
Woods that are full of wildlife

473
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:05,871
which likes to run out
in front of you.

474
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,410
After the second right
on the Isn't Straight,

475
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,180
we're into
Your Name Here Corner.

476
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:18,450
Sponsorship opportunities
are available here.

477
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,486
However, I should explain

478
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:23,589
that it's possible nobody
will be looking at your banner

479
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:25,957
because this is a corner
that was designed

480
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,427
so a car can do this.

481
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,108
Ladies and gentlemen,

482
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:46,245
James May...
isn't here today.

483
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:47,679
That's just a friend
of mine

484
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,850
on his way back up
the Isn't Straight...

485
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,220
towards Old Lady's House.

486
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:58,457
We've called this section
Old Lady's House,

487
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,492
because it's right next
to a house

488
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:04,129
where an old lady lives.

489
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,998
She tells us she likes cars.

490
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,835
Says she used to have one.

491
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,771
Not sure she's going
to like them quite so much

492
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,773
after we've been here
a few times.

493
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,779
Next up, there's a narrow
and bumpy sprint

494
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,515
to Sub Station.

495
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,884
You need to get
this 90-left right,

496
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,887
or you'll crash into
a cage full of electricity.

497
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:34,360
And you'll need to get the
final 90-left right as well,

498
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,928
or you'll run into
a field of sheep.

499
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,001
So, trees, animals,

500
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,936
a house, electricity,

501
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,772
and because it's in England,

502
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,940
usually quite a lot
of moisture in the air.

503
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,345
It really is the most dangerous
track anywhere in the world.

504
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,381
To post a fast time here,

505
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:59,017
you do need...

506
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,952
those.

507
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,728
The car I've selected
for my first lap

508
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,364
of the Eboladrome
is this.

509
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,404
The BMW M2.

510
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:35,987
Sadly, there isn't the time
in this, our first-ever show,

511
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:39,558
to do a full road test
of this car,

512
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:42,894
but there is time
to say that I think

513
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:46,798
this is the best M car
BMW has ever made.

514
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:02,381
In a lot of fast cars
these days,

515
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,550
you get all sorts
of knobs and buttons

516
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,353
which you can use
to change--

517
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:08,654
I say change--
I mean ruin

518
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,088
the characteristics
of the engine

519
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,958
and the suspension
and the steering and so on.

520
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,160
And I always think,
isn't that like a chef

521
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,995
bringing a fish to your table

522
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,598
and an oven and some butter
and a bit of parsley,

523
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:21,600
and saying,
"Cook it yourself"? No.

524
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,969
You cook it,
it's what I'm paying for.

525
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:27,373
This car, happily,
has a more

526
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:29,207
back-to-basics approach.

527
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:32,043
In the M2, you get a little
rocker switch down here

528
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,746
which does nothing at all

529
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:37,849
as far as I can see,
and that's it.

530
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,786
You're buying a car
which was set up at the factory

531
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:44,490
by engineers who know
what they're doing.

532
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,025
And all you have to do
is enjoy it.

533
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:50,962
Which I am doing.

534
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,670
Yes, look at this.

535
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,906
Oh, yeah, loving that.

536
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:05,611
I'll do that again, actually,
and make sure--

537
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:07,879
make sure I was correct.

538
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:16,755
There's hardly
any understeer at all.

539
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:20,158
Poke the back out
and hold it there.

540
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,994
Yeah!

541
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,830
I'll do that again...

542
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,632
only going the other way.

543
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:28,767
Wrong way round
Your Name Here.

544
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:36,174
Klaus and Fritz,
I am loving your work.

545
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:39,945
Oh, I made a mess of that.
But I'll just do this,

546
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,614
and it'll look like
I did it on purpose.

547
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,518
With the tires begging
for mercy,

548
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:48,219
I got back onto the Isn't

549
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,090
and unleashed
365 rampaging horsepowers

550
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,761
from the turbo-charged
three-liter straight six.

551
00:39:57,496 --> 00:40:00,466
This isn't as fast
in a straight line

552
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:03,234
as an M3,
but everywhere else...

553
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,070
it is better.

554
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,540
It feels less heavy,
less cumbersome.

555
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,616
And due to the unique
characteristics
of our straight,

556
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:20,552
I can tell the steering
is less...

557
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,921
It's less twitchy.

558
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:31,296
This track was designed
to trip cars up.

559
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,465
There are fast corners,

560
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,333
slow corners,

561
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,836
drifty corners, and bumps.

562
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:40,171
It's hard on the tires.

563
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,775
It's hard on the brakes.
It's hard on the engine.

564
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:47,546
It's point and squirt
and bark and yelp.

565
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,681
It is vicious.

566
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:56,855
But there is nothing here
which has flummoxed the M2.

567
00:40:56,855 --> 00:41:00,559
This thing is
an absolute masterpiece.

568
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,532
Like I said,
it is the best M car

569
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:08,233
BMW has ever made.

570
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,639
You may think
it's mad to suggest

571
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:16,207
the cheapest M car
is the best,

572
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,043
but look at it this way,

573
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:21,379
this track is a lot cheaper
than Silverstone.

574
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:24,182
And I know which one
I'd rather drive round.

575
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,463
Go drive an M2.
Unbelievable.

576
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:41,567
What?

577
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:45,103
Why is there that zigzag
at Old Lady's House?

578
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,272
- That wasn't there when I went.
- No, that wasn't.

579
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:49,340
But after you'd left,
we discovered there is

580
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,110
an unexploded Second
World War bomb, seriously,

581
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,914
right where the track was,
so we had to go round it.

582
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,448
- Fair enough.
- Let me get this right.

583
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:01,219
At our track,
there's trees, animals,

584
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,054
moisture, electricity,

585
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,090
a house,
and an unexploded bomb?

586
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,026
Yeah. Like I said, it's
the most dangerous track
in the world.

587
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:12,030
Honestly, it makes Imola
look like a duvet. Honestly.

588
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,801
Anyway, all the cars that
we test at the Eboladrome

589
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:17,636
will do a timed lap.

590
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:20,205
And to make sure it's
a completely level
playing field,

591
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:24,175
they will all be driven
by the same racing driver.

592
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,011
Ooh!

593
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:28,246
We thought about this.
We gave it some thought.

594
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,148
How clever is that? Now...

595
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:33,985
The thing is,
Amazon insisted

596
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,621
that the racing driver
in question

597
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:37,656
should be from this side
of the pond.

598
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:41,727
So we went to something
called NASCAR?

599
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:44,362
And we found one.
We shipped him to England

600
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:47,633
and then we introduced him
to the complicated procedure

601
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:51,502
which involves turning right.

602
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,904
He's called Mike Skinner,

603
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,506
but we know him simply as
"the American."

604
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,208
We should warn you

605
00:42:57,208 --> 00:43:00,178
that some of his views
are quite strong.

606
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:02,881
Yes, he has very specific
views, for example,

607
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:05,283
on cars that have engines
with fewer than eight cylinders.

608
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:07,485
- Communist.
- Or more than eight cylinders.

609
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:10,722
- Communist.
- Or cars that have
their engine in the middle.

610
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:12,724
Communist.

611
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:15,827
Everything that isn't American
really with a V8 is communist.

612
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:18,897
So let's see how he gets on
with the M2.

613
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:20,932
There he is.

614
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,268
Looking utterly bewildered.

615
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:28,306
But he's off.
A skitter of a wheel spin.

616
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:30,742
And immediately
he's onto the Isn't Straight.

617
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:33,211
There is a right there
that will have confused him.

618
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,746
Now a left,
he'll be good at that.

619
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:35,781
Now he can open the taps.

620
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:40,251
Three liters, six cylinders.

621
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,953
This thing wouldn't pull
a greasy string

622
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,855
out of a dog's ass.

623
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:48,727
I've literally no
idea what he's talking about.

624
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:51,462
Where I come from,
this ain't a car.

625
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,699
It's a cry for help.

626
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,533
Whatever.

627
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,903
He's through the final corner
on the Isn't Straight.

628
00:43:57,903 --> 00:44:00,706
Into Your Name Here.
Hard on the brakes.

629
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:02,708
Grabbing the stick,

630
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,710
which is on the left-hand
side of where he's sitting,

631
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,177
and turning in.

632
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,379
See what I mean?
No understeer at all.

633
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,481
Damn tracks are narrower
than my driveway.

634
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,284
Yeah, that's 'cause it doesn't
have a monster truck on it.

635
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:17,155
Wonder which one of them
came up with this thing.

636
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,358
The tall one? The short one?
Or the one with the girly hair?

637
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:23,561
Okay, coming up
to Old Lady's House.

638
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,030
Hard on the brakes.

639
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,933
Turning in, round
the unexploded bomb,

640
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:30,568
and now opening
the taps again.

641
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:33,104
No turbo lag at all,

642
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:35,506
as he hammers down
the bumpy back straight

643
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,342
towards Sub Station.

644
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,177
This is a 90-left,

645
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,046
new Tarmac
but it held it well.

646
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:44,082
One more 90-left to go
through Field Of Sheep.

647
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:47,185
And he's done it well.
And across the line.

648
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:53,624
First one. That's good.

649
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,193
He's great.

650
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:58,163
He's great going
left and right. Amazing.

651
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,031
To make sure that the M2--

652
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,968
that wasn't on the lap board
all by itself,

653
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:06,004
we got the American to put
other benchmark cars--

654
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:10,141
we call them benchmark cars,
he calls them communist--

655
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,177
around the track,
to see what's what.

656
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:14,112
McLaren, Audi and so forth.

657
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:16,314
Hang on a minute.
We saw a Ferrari 488

658
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:17,783
at the track
in the film earlier on.

659
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:19,017
Why isn't that on there?

660
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:21,186
Because Ferrari
wouldn't let us time it.

661
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:23,088
- Wouldn't let us?
- No.

662
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:25,791
So the Ferrari LaFerrari
can't go on the road

663
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:28,259
- or run on electric only?
- No.

664
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:30,128
And the 488
can't do a timed lap?

665
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:32,663
Ferrari are quite tricky to
deal with from time to time.

666
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,901
Let's just put it that way
and move on. It's time to see

667
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:38,236
where the M2 goes
on that board.

668
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:41,072
Let's have a look.
Let's put it on.

669
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,308
- Oh!
- Ha-ha!

670
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:44,976
Wow! Wow!

671
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:48,814
"I think it's the best M car
they've ever made."

672
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:52,517
Not my words.

673
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:54,853
"I prefer it to all the others
that are quicker than it."

674
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:57,823
- Yes, it's--
- The one you should have,

675
00:45:57,823 --> 00:46:00,091
if you want one that's slower
than all the other M cars.

676
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,427
It's better.
It's only two seconds--

677
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:05,396
- It's quicker than a Civic.
- Yeah.

678
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:07,032
But it's slower than--

679
00:46:07,032 --> 00:46:08,834
If you had a choice
of M cars, lined them up,

680
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:11,302
and said,
"I'd like the fastest,"
it wouldn't be that one.

681
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:14,739
- Shut up.
- Better in every single way?

682
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:17,208
- You said that.
- I don't care.
Have you driven one?

683
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:20,178
- I have.
- It's fabulous.

684
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:22,848
It's a brilliant car.
It really honestly is.

685
00:46:22,848 --> 00:46:25,951
It's a shame we can't take
the track round the world
with us.

686
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:29,087
Because if we did, we could
invite celebrities to drive
round it

687
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:31,122
and we could keep
a score sheet

688
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,358
of who was the fastest.

689
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,862
No, I don't like it!

690
00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:38,596
I don't like it, no.

691
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:41,166
- I don't think it would work.
- Nobody wants to watch that.

692
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:44,102
I'm not sure that they do.
Anyway, we've got a better idea,

693
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:46,137
Okay, for our celebrities.

694
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:49,207
We're calling it
Celebrity Brain Crash,

695
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:51,542
and we had a sting made
for that as well.

696
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:02,020
That is terrible.

697
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,255
I don't like to use this...

698
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,928
It's just terrible.

699
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:13,899
Who is gonna say,
"I'm gonna watch that
new Amazon car show.

700
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:16,634
Henry VIII's head explodes"?

701
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:20,105
Why is there smoke coming out
of Brad Pitt's head?

702
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:22,640
What are we trying to say?

703
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,609
- No, we're not.
- No, we're not saying that.

704
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:27,812
Not that.

705
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:29,647
That is a terrible sting,

706
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:32,717
but the machine itself
isn't terrible at all.

707
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:35,686
It's used to measure
somebody's mental agility,

708
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,522
their observational skills

709
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:40,191
and their ability
to multi-task.

710
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,227
It's actually based
on a machine

711
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:44,262
that's used
to test fighter pilots

712
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:46,297
who want to join
the Royal Air Force

713
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:49,200
which, as we all know, is the
finest and greatest air force

714
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,503
in the world.

715
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:56,141
What do you mean, "Boo"?
What do you mean, "Boo"?
What?

716
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:59,110
If that was true, we wouldn't
have to help you every time
you get in trouble.

717
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:09,620
I'll hold myself back here.

718
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:13,391
Now, hold on. You lot can
grumble as much as you like,

719
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,394
but we edit this show
and we're British,

720
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,396
so you'll just get cut out.

721
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,566
We're all in agreement.

722
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:25,770
That the Royal Air Force is
better than the US Air Force.

723
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:29,407
USA! USA! USA!

724
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,809
We're all in agreement

725
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:35,480
the Royal Air Force is better
than all the other air forces
in the world.

726
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,751
We're all now in agreement.

727
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,520
The Royal Air Force is--

728
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,522
is the best air force
in the world.

729
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,061
So we're all in agreement
the Royal Air Force
is quite good.

730
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:52,998
That will do. That will do.

731
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:56,701
So let's get back
to Celebrity Brain Crash

732
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,636
and meet our first-ever guest.

733
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,471
Normally on other shows,

734
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:02,507
the guest will come through
a sparkly curtain,

735
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:05,810
wave a bit and then sit down,
but not here.

736
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:09,614
Oh, yes, our guests
make a proper arrival.

737
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,750
And on that note,
let's meet tonight's star.

738
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,420
He has been in pretty much

739
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,256
every single movie franchise
there is

740
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:20,291
apart from Bridget Jones.

741
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,293
No, he was Bridget Jones.

742
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,562
- Was he?
- No.

743
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:27,498
But it doesn't matter.
He was in the Bourne  films.

744
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:29,200
He was in the
Mission Impossible films,

745
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,568
the Avengers films,

746
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:34,139
and right now
he is 10,000 feet above us,

747
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,707
waiting to make
one hell of an entrance.

748
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,177
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jeremy Renner!

749
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:45,050
There he is. There he is,
that's his plane.

750
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:52,390
Hold on, everybody.
Here he comes.

751
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,126
He is ready to jump.

752
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:56,827
I'm ready!

753
00:49:56,827 --> 00:50:00,065
He is ready to jump.
And there he goes!

754
00:50:00,065 --> 00:50:01,599
That is amazing

755
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,401
to see him doing
his own stunts.

756
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:06,937
Yeah, I know.
And he is looking good!

757
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,006
When he gets here,

758
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,709
I do want to talk to him
about that Bourne Legacy
film.

759
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:14,445
what it was like to punch
Shane Jacobson.

760
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:17,515
And, B...
Ooh, hang on.

761
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,751
He's leaving this terribly late.

762
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:42,573
Right.

763
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,875
Does that mean
he's not coming on, then?

764
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,812
No, James, he's not.

765
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:51,116
It's okay, though.
We anticipated
this sort of thing,

766
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:53,151
so we got
a back-up guest ready.

767
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,186
Uh...

768
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:57,555
He was in Man From Uncle.

769
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,991
He was in Lone Ranger.
He was both twins

770
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,760
in The Social Network.

771
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,530
And his new film is called
Nocturnal Animals.

772
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,565
We haven't had time,
unfortunately,

773
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,500
to organize
a dramatic entrance,

774
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,337
but I hope you'll give him
a warm welcome nevertheless.

775
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:14,739
Ladies and gentlemen,
Armie Hammer!

776
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,842
There he is.

777
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,978
Oh, my...

778
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:22,680
Jesus!

779
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,482
Is that a snake?

780
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:26,384
- It's a snake.
- That's a rattlesnake.

781
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,386
- Is it?
- Yeah.

782
00:51:28,386 --> 00:51:31,289
He's being killed.
Quiet, everyone.

783
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:33,324
Quiet, please.

784
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:35,360
There's literally
nothing we can do.

785
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,395
He's yards away from us.

786
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:39,063
Snakes are like herds
of them.

787
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:41,766
- They hunt in packs.
- Yeah, they're pack animals.

788
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:44,535
Does that mean
he's not coming on either?

789
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,805
No, James, he's finished
writhing around in agony.

790
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:49,840
And now he's dead.

791
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,876
So that is a no.

792
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,711
Well, uh...

793
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:56,281
maybe there's somebody famous
in the audience.

794
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,283
That's unlikely.

795
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:00,751
No. Seriously,
you know Carol Vorderman?

796
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:03,321
She rang me this morning
from an air show nearby

797
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:06,357
and said,
can she come to the show?

798
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,359
I know you don't know
who Carol Vorderman is.

799
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:10,895
She's a huge, huge,
huge star in the UK.

800
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:12,930
She started out on
a program called Countdown

801
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,200
and established herself as
being unbelievably brilliant,

802
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,202
a fantastic mathematician

803
00:52:17,202 --> 00:52:19,237
and very beautiful.

804
00:52:19,237 --> 00:52:22,540
Yes, she's also dead.

805
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,074
What?

806
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,878
- What?
- She's dead.

807
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,648
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.
I'm not a pathologist!

808
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,284
But she's dead
is what she is.

809
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:35,286
- Seriously?
- Yes!

810
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:38,289
- Christ.
- Problem.

811
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,591
What are we gonna do?

812
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:41,859
Um...

813
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:44,229
Jesus, look at that out there.
It's like a--

814
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:45,863
It's just littered
with corpses.

815
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,836
Lads, I don't think
this bit is working.

816
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,238
Let's drop

817
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:55,573
Celebrity Brain Crash
this week.

818
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:57,708
We'll do it again in
South Africa next week,

819
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,744
and I think people will
have forgotten all this.

820
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:02,513
- They might not.
- I think they will.

821
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,949
We'll just skip over it now.
It's not gonna happen.

822
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:07,285
That's okay, 'cause we
can back to the cars.

823
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:10,388
Yes! Moving on!

824
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,091
- Don't look.
- Yes, don't look.

825
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:15,460
This week--

826
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,762
This week we are trying
to find out

827
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:20,531
which of the new breed of
hybrid hypercars is the best.

828
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,900
Yes. On day one
at the track in Portugal,

829
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,404
we established that
the McLaren P1 is a mentalist,

830
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:30,174
that the Porsche 918
is a very good milk float,

831
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:33,444
and that the Ferrari LaFerrari
can do nothing at all.

832
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:36,381
Some of that is true.

833
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:39,484
But now, day two.

834
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,629
We began by lining up

835
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:54,365
the three most exciting cars
on the planet

836
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:58,002
for the drag race
of all drag races.

837
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:15,686
Naturally, this meant
engaging launch control,

838
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:20,024
which in the McLaren
takes about a fortnight.

839
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:24,094
I have to have the drive tray
in track mode,

840
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,331
the aero package
in sport mode,

841
00:54:26,331 --> 00:54:27,665
so that the rear end squats

842
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:29,634
when I set off
and gives me more traction.

843
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:32,870
I have to have the DRS
button pressed with my thumb

844
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,874
to keep the rear wing open
which reduces drag obviously.

845
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:39,977
Launch control in the Porsche,
left foot on the brake hard.

846
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,012
Right foot
on the throttle hard.

847
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,349
Light goes green, left foot
off brake. Pa-ching!

848
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:46,751
Launch button,
press for two seconds.

849
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:49,520
Left foot on brake.
Right foot on throttle.

850
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,956
Press launch control,
mash the throttle,

851
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,759
within four seconds
release the brake.

852
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:57,995
Three seconds later,
I have full boost,

853
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,431
and I have to set off
within three seconds

854
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:02,833
or the entire system
disengages.

855
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:05,603
I'm going to get this wrong.

856
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:07,638
Just so you know.

857
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,940
I've got a lot to do in here.

858
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:39,169
I wasn't ready.

859
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,939
Oh, my God!
That is quick!

860
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:49,947
Holy mother!
Did you see that?

861
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:53,183
- me!
- Jesus Christ!

862
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,119
It's all over the place.

863
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,060
Since it was clear I'd got
all my buttons wrong,

864
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,497
the chaps agreed
to another run.

865
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:08,533
Sit rep,
the lights went green

866
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:10,601
before the boost was ready,

867
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:12,770
and I had the DRS button
still pressed

868
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,440
when I got to the end,
which meant I had no downforce,

869
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,643
which meant--
Well, poo came out.

870
00:56:18,643 --> 00:56:22,713
This time I'm gonna do it
with more drag,

871
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,315
which will slow me down,
but I will be able to stop

872
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,452
without killing myself.

873
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:34,559
KERS system charged. Right.

874
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:41,566
Boost building.

875
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:46,504
Three, two...

876
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:52,543
And we are away!
What a start!

877
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:57,715
The Porsche has got off
to a flyer.

878
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:01,151
Oh, balls!

879
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,889
180, 190, 210.

880
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:08,726
230 kilometers an hour.

881
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:16,967
That wasn't very good.

882
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:20,204
Because James had
somehow messed up that time,

883
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:22,673
and because this test
was about the cars,

884
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:25,209
we decided to go again.

885
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:31,782
It's a rocket ship.

886
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:35,620
For England!

887
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:38,989
No, no!

888
00:57:44,729 --> 00:57:46,997
Okay, we have all three
won this now.

889
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:51,902
Determined
to find a definitive

890
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:55,405
one-two-three
finishing order,

891
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,274
we ran again.

892
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:06,216
Another totally different
result there, gentlemen.

893
00:58:07,384 --> 00:58:08,819
And again.

894
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:15,760
That's a different result
again.

895
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,895
And again?

896
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,369
At this point,
we decided to call

897
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:26,937
a halt to proceedings,

898
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:31,609
because we had reached
a scientific conclusion.

899
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:35,045
It turns out it doesn't really
matter which car you buy,

900
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,281
it all depends on your shoes.

901
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:38,983
Now, this is a TOD loafer.

902
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:42,052
Slightly worn
to get a crisper jump

903
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:44,254
off the brake pedal,
and it's immediate.

904
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,191
- This is a Converse.
- There's more sponge
in there than I thought.

905
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:50,160
See, Adidas, they weren't
thinking that through.

906
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,330
- So, as you lift
your foot up--
- It's a millisecond.

907
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,699
I know you've got KERS,

908
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:56,266
I know you've got
a 6.3-litre V12,

909
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,836
and I know that launch
control system is amazing,

910
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:00,237
but it's all let down

911
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,206
by the sponginess
of the Adidas shoe.

912
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,441
So they should sell you
the car and the shoes.

913
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:06,977
No, have you got the correct
shoes and have you worn them in?

914
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:09,013
- Exactly.
- Fresh shoes, lads.

915
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:13,217
- I just need to--
- You need to skid about.
There we go.

916
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,820
With that sorted,

917
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,055
it was time to bring in
a racing driver

918
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,926
to see which of our cars
could do the fastest lap.

919
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:25,262
Our resident American
said he wasn't interested,

920
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:28,265
because all three cars
are probably communist.

921
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:31,636
So instead, we went
for a Belgian chap--

922
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,807
...who's done Formula One
and Formula E,

923
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,343
Jerome d'Ambrosio.

924
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,016
Jerome took the cars out

925
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:48,686
to get a sense of how
they handled.

926
01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:06,837
And when he'd finished,

927
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:08,639
we were interested to hear

928
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:10,607
his professional opinion.

929
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:57,421
At this point,
word reached us that Jeremy

930
01:00:57,421 --> 01:01:01,091
was taking liberties
with the subtitling machine.

931
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:05,429
So we moved on
to the big event:

932
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:08,098
the timed laps.

933
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:15,472
Once the mechanics had
finished their preparations,

934
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:18,408
the three speed traps
were activated.

935
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:24,548
And the Ferrari LaFerrari
took its place

936
01:01:24,548 --> 01:01:27,051
on the start line.

937
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,220
Look how good it looks there.

938
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,557
This is just wasting time.
It's wasting rubber and fuel.

939
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:35,392
No, this is like
an amuse-bouche.

940
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:39,096
Yeah, it is. You have ordered
the duck and sherry trifle.

941
01:01:39,096 --> 01:01:42,833
- And you're a melon ball.
- I'm not even listening.

942
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:03,453
Gentlemen, it is doing
231.4 kilometers an hour

943
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:05,589
at the end of the straight.

944
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:09,193
It's about the same speed
as a Golf diesel,
something like that.

945
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,276
194.9.

946
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:28,112
Going down the hill
using gravity.

947
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:30,314
- Is he stopping off
for shopping?
- He must be.

948
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:48,098
Here he is.

949
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:59,343
- James, if you want
to get a cup of tea.
- We've warmed the track.

950
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:03,848
Next it was the turn
of the Porsche 918.

951
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:06,350
How much faster will it go
because of the stripes?

952
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,351
Much.

953
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:24,134
231 point...

954
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,170
So he's faster
than the Ferrari.

955
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,182
183.0.

956
01:03:38,182 --> 01:03:41,785
Way, way,
way slower than him.

957
01:03:41,785 --> 01:03:43,921
Don't forget between here
and the next measuring point,

958
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:46,590
Okay, you've got
four slow corners,

959
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,259
and those are the ones
where the Porsche
is gonna make up time.

960
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,362
Because of the
four-wheel steering.

961
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:56,033
- Like a Honda Prelude?
- No!

962
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:12,449
- 110 point what?
- One.

963
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:16,386
So, almost to a tenth
of a kilometer an hour,
the same speed as you.

964
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:24,061
Here he comes.
He's firing noises.

965
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:26,931
There it is.
Look at that.

966
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:33,337
Finally, it was
the turn of the psycho killer.

967
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:36,040
The trickiest,
the edgiest of the three.

968
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,443
But I was so confident
it'd win,

969
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:43,047
I was prepared
to take a massive gamble.

970
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:49,086
If the McLaren
isn't the fastest,

971
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:51,956
you two can knock
my house down.

972
01:04:51,956 --> 01:04:54,124
- What?
- Knock it down.

973
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:56,994
- What, your house?
- Yeah, and I mean that.

974
01:04:56,994 --> 01:05:00,664
That's how confident I am
that that will be the fastest.

975
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:04,801
- You know we will do that?
- Yeah.

976
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:07,271
- It's a serious bet?
- Yeah.

977
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:09,839
- Fine.
- If that's not the fastest,

978
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,409
- we can knock your house down?
- Yup.

979
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,644
You know where it is.
You've both been.

980
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,613
I'd love to knock it down.

981
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,222
Here we go.
A lot riding on this.

982
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:41,305
235.9.

983
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:44,008
Okay, it's fastest at the end
of the first straight.

984
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:50,747
Would you like to come
to my house for dinner?

985
01:05:50,747 --> 01:05:52,549
Yes. Can I bring a bulldozer?

986
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:02,192
188.3.

987
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:04,228
That is worryingly quick.
Brisk.

988
01:06:04,228 --> 01:06:06,063
It's quite brisk?

989
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:08,865
We don't know how fast it's
going around the tight turns.

990
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:11,435
Might have been doing
two kilometers an hour
around here.

991
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,382
Where is he?

992
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:26,616
Crashed.

993
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:46,936
With that,
back to the tent.

994
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:56,646
Thank you so much. Now...

995
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,682
I want to make it
absolutely plain,

996
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:00,717
'cause I know this matters
to anoraks,

997
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:06,156
all three cars were running
on exactly the same sort
of tires.

998
01:07:06,156 --> 01:07:08,758
Yes, same tires, same track,
same driver.

999
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:11,095
So the times
are down to the cars.

1000
01:07:11,095 --> 01:07:14,331
Yup. And now it is time
to reveal those times.

1001
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:16,533
Let me just make it
absolutely clear.

1002
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,102
We don't know what they are.

1003
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:20,270
The producers have kept them
from us.

1004
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:21,605
- They're top secret.
- Yup.

1005
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:23,773
So, let's put
the scoreboard up,

1006
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,008
and let's begin with

1007
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:27,644
the Ferrari LaFerrari,
I believe.

1008
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:30,114
Let's see what it did it in,
please.

1009
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,953
We don't know
if that's any good, do we?

1010
01:07:36,953 --> 01:07:39,323
Let's move on
and do the Porsche next.

1011
01:07:39,323 --> 01:07:40,790
What did the Porsche
do it in?

1012
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:46,630
Oh, yes! 1:54.2!

1013
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:49,533
Yes! Yes! You see?

1014
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:51,668
You said it would mince
the Porsche.

1015
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:55,038
And it didn't mince it.
It was slower than the Porsche.

1016
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:56,906
I told you
it's just a melon ball.

1017
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,842
It's slower than my car,

1018
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:01,378
which was faster
than your car.

1019
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:03,613
0.2 of a second,
and it looks better.

1020
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:06,350
Yeah, it did in my mirror
where it belongs getting
smaller.

1021
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:07,951
It's a melon ball,
and it lost.

1022
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:09,186
- Hammond.
- What?

1023
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:10,954
- Calm down.
- All right.

1024
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:12,156
Because now we must bring up

1025
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:13,723
the time that really matters.

1026
01:08:13,723 --> 01:08:17,294
The one where
a lot's at stake.

1027
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:18,295
The McLaren...

1028
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:19,463
The McLaren P1.

1029
01:08:19,463 --> 01:08:22,166
- Are you nervous? Sure?
- No. No.

1030
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,500
- A little bit?
- No!

1031
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,269
- I'm not nervous.
- Why be nervous?

1032
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,470
You could get, like,
a shopping trolley

1033
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:28,705
and keep all your things
in it.

1034
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:31,575
Make some new friends
under a bridge somewhere.

1035
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:33,843
- Hammond.
- I'd say sell your body
but don't do that.

1036
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,580
Be quiet! Let's--

1037
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,316
Let's bring up the time
of the P1. Here we go.

1038
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:42,419
- Oh, God.
- Where is it?

1039
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:52,462
Yes!

1040
01:08:56,666 --> 01:09:00,404
That is funny.
Because you said...

1041
01:09:00,404 --> 01:09:03,207
the fastest,
but it's not the fastest.

1042
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:05,209
It's the slowest!

1043
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:08,445
Ladies and gentlemen,
journalist, broadcaster

1044
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:11,881
and homeless man,
Jeremy Clarkson.

1045
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:23,560
That's what it is.
That's what it is.

1046
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,363
You're not really going
to knock my house down?

1047
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:28,865
Yes, we are.

1048
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:30,900
- A bet is a bet.
- That's the deal.

1049
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,637
- And we're going to film it.
- No, but the thing is,

1050
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:36,240
on the tires that the
McLaren can be bought with,

1051
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,575
it was faster.

1052
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:40,277
We agreed right at the start

1053
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:43,380
we'd all run on
the same tires.

1054
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,849
That was the deal
before your car lost.

1055
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,384
So let's just...

1056
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:50,887
Let's just sum this
first show up, shall we?

1057
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:52,722
I've lost my house.

1058
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:55,091
- We've had a fight
with the audience.
- Big one.

1059
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:57,961
Somebody shot our drone down.

1060
01:09:57,961 --> 01:10:00,664
And we've killed three
quite major celebrities.

1061
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:02,699
Yeah, but on the plus side,

1062
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,901
my Porsche was the fastest!

1063
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:12,576
And on that terrible
disappointment,

1064
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:14,678
I'm afraid it's time to end.

1065
01:10:14,678 --> 01:10:16,480
Thank you all very much
for coming.

1066
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,014
Thank you for watching.

1067
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:19,883
And we'll see you next week
in Johannesburg.

1068
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:21,285
Good-bye!
