1
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,432
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,200
Hello. Greetings. Thank you.

3
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,137
Hi, there.

4
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,472
Hello! Hello!

5
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,543
Thank you so much. Thank you.

6
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,212
Thank you so much. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

7
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,481
And welcome to
The Grand Tour,

8
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,983
which, once again,
is in Whitby.

9
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,923
There is actually
a very good reason for that.

10
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,594
It is because these two
last week blew up my house,

11
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:36,230
and I literally have
nowhere else to go.

12
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,431
Yeah.

13
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:40,000
Plus-- Plus, James May
lost the tent bag.

14
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,469
- Soz.
- Yeah, he did.

15
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,272
He did do that.
Anyway, erm...

16
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,675
we were reminiscing,
as we've been here all week,

17
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:51,345
and we worked out
that Yorkshire
is the only place on earth

18
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:55,082
where all three of us
have had a car crash.

19
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:57,285
So what was yours?

20
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,587
A Triumph 2500 rolled over.

21
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,922
-Yeah. Hammond?
-My first car.

22
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,491
And my second car.

23
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,494
My mum's car, my dad's car,

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,196
my third and fourth cars,

25
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:10,264
my first four motorcycles,

26
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,065
the Radio York radio van,

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,468
the Radio Leeds radio car,

28
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,370
and a jet-powered dragster.

29
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,772
Oh, yes.

30
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,342
All of those. Busy.

31
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:24,245
And, erm... And what about
you in Yorkshire?

32
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,315
Well, me, I'll tell you.
No, 1977,

33
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,383
when the driving examiner
said to me,

34
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,752
"Congratulations,
Mr Clarkson, you've passed,"

35
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,722
what I heard was,
"Congratulations,
Mr Clarkson,

36
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,990
you are the best driver
I've ever seen."

37
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,427
- Oh, no.
- 36 hours later -

38
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,029
That's all it was, 36 hours
I'd been on the roads -

39
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,431
stuffed my mother's Audi.

40
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,266
Wheels came off,
killed a sheep.

41
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,237
So, if you're the farmer,
sorry about that.

42
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:51,405
Er... Anyway, I'm glad
we're still in Yorkshire,

43
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:56,377
because last week we said
there was no real motoring
connection with the county,

44
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:59,247
and it turns out
that's not true.

45
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:01,382
I was reading Trip Advisor
last night.

46
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,885
Now, Trip Advisor is a
website for the mealy-mouthed
and the bitter.

47
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,520
Well, hang on.
I mean, it's not entirely--

48
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,122
No, seriously, it's useless
apart from anything else,

49
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:14,262
because you have to know
someone before their opinion
is relevant.

50
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,096
I mean, I know Hammond, OK?

51
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,532
So if he tells me
a restaurant's great,

52
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,335
I know
I don't want to go there,
because it'll be rubbish.

53
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:25,038
You're absolutely right,
actually, because that bloke
in the hat over there,

54
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,909
I don't care how many stars
he gives Oxfam Whitby,
I'm not going there.

55
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,513
Exactly. Anyway...

56
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,285
I went on Trip Advisor,
OK, and there was
a review of Whitby.

57
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,688
And it said,
and I'm quoting here,

58
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:44,758
"One aspect of Whitby
is the large number
of local chavs..."

59
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:48,596
"...who drive around
the town in a circuit

60
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,699
in their
noise-enhanced cars."

61
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,335
Already,
I don't like this person.

62
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,169
"They accelerated
down the narrow streets

63
00:03:56,304 --> 00:04:00,408
and then slowed their engines
down quickly as they
approached a junction,

64
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,644
causing explosive-sounding
backfiring."

65
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,447
He sounds like a right knob.

66
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:07,715
Of course he's a right knob,

67
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,117
he's leaving a message
on Trip Advisor.

68
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,921
Anyway, the police -
the police, the local
police here -

69
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,490
they've decided
they've had enough of people,
how they put it,

70
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:21,529
"...driving away in a manner
that causes their wheels
to spin and screech."

71
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,531
OK? So they decided
to have a clampdown.

72
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,799
But,
and this is the quote I love,

73
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:29,069
"The operation was curtailed
due to poor weather."

74
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:32,806
What, are they saying...

75
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,942
They didn't go out
because it was raining?

76
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,945
No, law enforcement
in Whitby is like cricket.

77
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,348
Everybody just goes inside
if it starts to drizzle.

78
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:43,851
So this is... This is
the Whitby Town Police
we are talking about here?

79
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,853
-Yeah, the WTPD.
-Yeah.

80
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:50,023
No, hang on a minute,
this is North Yorkshire.
It's NYPD.

81
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,594
Wow!
It actually is!
It's the NYPD!

82
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,364
That would be
a brilliant police drama.

83
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:57,798
"Right, Constable,

84
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:01,735
I've had the Chief Constable,
he's chewed my arse,

85
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,738
the Mayor's chewed his arse,
now we'll chew your arse."

86
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,608
"We've got these lads -
well, chavs -

87
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,677
"that are doing,
like, wheel screeches,

88
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:13,981
and you've got 48 hours to
solve it, or I'll have your
badge and your truncheon."

89
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,819
Anyway,
on our car show tonight...

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,789
a tree falls over...

91
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,559
... a hedgehog
makes a noise...

92
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,029
...and a dog eats some meat.

93
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,900
But we begin with Porsche.

94
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:37,137
They offer an immense
and immensely complicated
range of cars

95
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,407
all under the 911 banner.

96
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:43,544
Now, Porsche enthusiasts,
by which I mean
these two imbeciles,

97
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,113
say that they're all
slightly different.

98
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,548
Completely different.

99
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,182
No, slightly different,

100
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:53,086
and that the best of
the bunch is something
called the GT3 RS.

101
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:57,625
So I thought
I'd take it to our track
to see what it was like.

102
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,428
And let's just hope that,
for once in your life,

103
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,129
you haven't
behaved like a child.

104
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,299
-What do you mean?
-Well, just said it's no good
because I've got one.

105
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:11,805
Hammond, I am a professional
motoring journalist,
and coming up...

106
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,676
Amongst other things.

107
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:19,179
Coming up now
is my professional review.

108
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,819
This is the car in question.

109
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,458
No, wait. Sorry. Hang on.

110
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,359
It's easy to be confused.

111
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,594
This is it.

112
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,833
The hottest, hardest,

113
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,636
tightest 911 of them all...

114
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,873
...and the most exotic.

115
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:01,889
It has the fattest back tyres
I've ever seen on a road car.

116
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,625
It has scaffolding
in the back for stiffness,

117
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,260
carbon-fibre body panels
for lightness.

118
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,797
The roof is made
from magnesium,

119
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,500
so if you turn it over
and there are sparks,

120
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,835
there will be
a blinding flash of light,

121
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,804
and then you will have
a convertible.

122
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:30,818
Like many people,
I don't really like the idea
of the Porsche 911,

123
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,954
and I certainly don't like
the people who drive them.

124
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:38,692
I find them flawed,
in some dark and
rather disgusting way.

125
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,528
But I will grudgingly admit

126
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,597
that even the basic
cooking models are...

127
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,966
extremely lovely to drive.

128
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,034
They're...

129
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,537
They're just very good
sports cars.

130
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,407
But what about this one?

131
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:55,576
Well...

132
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,211
Let's find out.

133
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,420
Straight away,
I can tell you the engine...

134
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,356
is incredible.

135
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,160
There's no turbocharging.

136
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:18,098
It's just a four litre
flat-six, but...

137
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,568
you get 500 horsepower.

138
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,338
And its red line at 9,000rpm.

139
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,380
9,000!

140
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,082
That's bike territory.

141
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:41,855
But the best thing is the way
it goes round corners.

142
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,625
Because it's got
four-wheel steering,

143
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:49,262
and because the engine
is sitting right over
the rear axle,

144
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,666
the grip is just astonishing.

145
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,107
I've engaged all
the hero buttons down here,

146
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:04,411
turned all the electronic
driver aids off,

147
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,981
and let see
if I can unstick it.

148
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,452
In here far too fast
into Swindon Swings.

149
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,858
Not "Swings,"
that's something
completely different.

150
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:21,194
But, anyway,
no loss of traction at all.

151
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,267
I thought, when I read
the spec sheet on the RS,

152
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,638
that Porsche
had tried to make a supercar,

153
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:35,275
a rival for Ferrari
and McLaren and Lamborghini,
but they haven't.

154
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,177
It's still a sports car.

155
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,647
It's still chuckable
and deft.

156
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:48,288
Whoa! It's very, very good.

157
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,657
Annoyingly.

158
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:59,066
But... is it as good as this,

159
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,035
the BMW M4 GTS?

160
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:07,641
Like the Porsche,
it's made from exotic
lightweight materials...

161
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:11,478
and fitted with scaffolding
instead of back seats,

162
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,180
and enormous tyres.

163
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,050
It looks good.

164
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,986
But there are some problems.

165
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,590
When you arrive at a small
speed hump in the Porsche,

166
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:27,060
you raise its nose
electrically and all is well.

167
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,965
But when you arrive at
the same hump in the BMW...

168
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:36,804
you will need a team of men
to fold away the spoiler

169
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,572
and adjust the ride height.

170
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,308
This takes several hours.

171
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,246
There are some other issues
as well.

172
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:51,852
To give owners the sense
they're driving a racing car,

173
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,855
all of the storage bins
have been removed.

174
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:57,825
There's no cubbyhole here,
no door pockets.

175
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,060
That means there's
nowhere to put anything.

176
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:04,297
And I think that,
on a day-to-day basis, that
would drive you a bit mad.

177
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,238
Then there's the ride,
which is extremely bumpy,

178
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,908
and the drone from the tyres,
which is horrendous.

179
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,747
After ten minutes
on a motorway,

180
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,214
you will have a headache,

181
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,751
and you won't have any
headache pills with you,

182
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,152
because there was
nowhere to put them.

183
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:30,423
Now, at this point,
I would normally use
the word "however"

184
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,761
and start talking about
the car's good points.

185
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,563
However...

186
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,799
I can't, because...

187
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,969
I'm struggling to find any.

188
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,039
The engine, for example,
has water injection,

189
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,475
which sounds cool.

190
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,212
But it means
that every third time
you fill the car with fuel,

191
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,949
you have to fill
a water tank in the boot.

192
00:11:56,016 --> 00:12:01,955
I don't know, but I'm not
sure this is very hi-tech.

193
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,128
And then there's
the steering, which
in comfort mode is horrid,

194
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:11,298
and in sport setting
is even more horrid.

195
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,168
That said,
the steering wheel is nice.

196
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,270
It's good and thick. It's...

197
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,974
It's like holding onto
something from
the Ron Jeremy range.

198
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,910
And the seats aren't bad.

199
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,111
But other than that...

200
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:26,947
No.

201
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,817
A point that becomes
even more obvious

202
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,352
when you go into battle
against the Porsche.

203
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:41,161
We both have
around 500 horsepower,

204
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:44,097
both have a top speed
of around 190,

205
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,534
but the Porsche
is a lot lighter.

206
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:53,140
Probably because it doesn't
have a tank full of water
in the boot.

207
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,450
Struggling to keep up now.

208
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,888
Here we go, into Swindon.

209
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,890
Oh, "Springs"!

210
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,959
A pampas grass shop.

211
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,494
Oh! We're having...
God, that's nasty.

212
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,299
This is not a car
that responds well

213
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:22,569
to my rather brutal
driving style.

214
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,006
The problem is...

215
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,943
it doesn't really respond
very well to delicacy,
either.

216
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,885
This competition here now
between these two cars

217
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:41,922
is like a boxing match
between an actual boxer

218
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,257
and someone
who thinks they're a boxer

219
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,493
because they're wearing
satin shorts.

220
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:15,923
How did BMW get
this thing so wrong?

221
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,157
Oh, God!

222
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:23,030
It's twitchy,
it's unpredictable.

223
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,331
And in the rain,

224
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,968
it's somewhere between
spiteful and undrive...

225
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,970
Oh, God! ...undriveable.

226
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,547
But, that said, this has to
be the winner of this test

227
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,582
because Richard Hammond...

228
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,452
...has got one of those.

229
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,160
I called it.

230
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,728
That was annoying.

231
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,664
That was
a professional review.

232
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,999
At points.

233
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,467
But you were doing so well,

234
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,269
and then you ruined it
at the end.

235
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,336
What do you mean, ruined it?

236
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,972
By saying you'd have
a worse car

237
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,673
because I haven't got one.

238
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,276
-That Porsche wounded me.
-Wounded you?

239
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,812
It did wound me,
because, you know,
it's got so much grip

240
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,247
that you're sort of
forced into the seat?

241
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,083
And the seat's
got stitching on it

242
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,517
which digs a hole
in your back.

243
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,552
I've got a picture
of what it did. Look at this!

244
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,588
That's my back!

245
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,092
Oh, I'm amazed
you weren't hospitalised
with that! That's horrific!

246
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,995
-That is a savage wound!
-Mine's never done that
to me.

247
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:31,331
That's cos you're a midget!
You don't reach that
high up the seat.

248
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,866
Or maybe you're a freak
and sit in the wrong place.

249
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,336
It's not just the fact
it wounds you.

250
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,539
Also, the Porsche's
more expensive than the BMW.

251
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,010
Yes, but I'd rather spend
£131,000 on the Porsche

252
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,813
than £120,000 on a BMW that's
not very good on the road,

253
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,248
not very good on a track,

254
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,183
and no good
at all in the rain.

255
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,684
Yeah, no,
that's fair enough.

256
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,120
-Hold on.
-What?

257
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,122
I've got to the bottom of
the problem with the BMW.

258
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,889
It's right here
in the blurb.

259
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,491
"Developed on
the Nürburgring."

260
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,262
Yeah, and, actually,
speaking of tracks,

261
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:05,465
it's now time
to hand the M4 over

262
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:09,802
to a man who thinks
that sparkling water
is basically communist.

263
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,405
Yeah, time to give it
to the American.

264
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,676
There he is.

265
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,945
And he's off! No messing.

266
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,647
Parps from the exhaust
on the upshifts

267
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,250
as he attacks
the Isn't Straight.

268
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,552
I wonder if he actually
knows what he's in.

269
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,054
Driving a BMW.

270
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,290
British Motor Works.

271
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,425
So, that's a no, then.

272
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,594
OK, continuing up the Isn't.

273
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,131
They say it's got more power.

274
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,535
Than what,
my damn toothbrush?

275
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,237
OK.

276
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,207
Right to the end
of the Isn't now,

277
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,841
and into Your Name Here.

278
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,111
Hard on the brakes,
keeping it all in check,

279
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:55,348
and surely he'll appreciate
the turbos punching him
out of the corner.

280
00:16:55,415 --> 00:17:00,420
Turbos on an engine is
God's way of telling you it
ain't got enough cylinders.

281
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,156
My mistake.
Right, back up the Isn't.

282
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,325
Really winding up
that straight-six.

283
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,561
I must admit, from
the outside, it sounds good.

284
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,797
And already
he's turning in hard,

285
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,165
round the Unexploded Bomb,

286
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:15,602
into the narrowness
of Old Lady's House.

287
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:19,272
Yeah, back on the power
for the bumpy bit
towards Sub Station.

288
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,209
Idiotic splitter
in peril over the ruts.

289
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,677
Now working
the ceramic brakes hard

290
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,845
for the tight left.

291
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,715
Tickle of power.
There it is.

292
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,418
And left again
into Field Of Sheep.

293
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,654
A whiff of oversteer,
and across the line!

294
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,391
It looked tidy.

295
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,826
Yeah, it looked all right.

296
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,194
It looked tidy. Right...

297
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,596
Let's bring up the er...

298
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,565
Let's bring up
the leader board, if we can.

299
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:49,336
Now, there we are.
We've already had
the 911 GT3 RS round.

300
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,338
Wha-- And you're
not gonna show the lap?

301
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,605
Nobody's interested
in watching an American

302
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,508
being sawn in half
by a glorified Beetle.

303
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,610
It did 1:20.4.

304
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,147
Right, so, now let's see
what the M4 did.

305
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,383
Let's put the time up.
There it is.

306
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,154
Two seconds slower,
and that's a short track.

307
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,222
That's unbelievable.
That's not good, is it?

308
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:13,193
No.
It's only a second faster
than a Porsche 718.

309
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,362
I know.
I mean, I admire BMW

310
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,997
for trying with that car.
I really do.

311
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,066
But, my God,
they've made a hash of it.

312
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,335
In fact, I'm trying
to think of a metaphor

313
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,838
for someone who's really tried
their hardest with something

314
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,540
and it hasn't worked.

315
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,714
No, nothing's coming to mind.

316
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,316
I've got nothing.
I've got nothing.

317
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,484
I've got nothing at all.

318
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,186
So, let's...
Let's move it on.

319
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:43,856
It's time for us to make
a gentle left into
Conversation Street.

320
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,800
OK. Right, I want to begin
with the new Ford GT.

321
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,536
You've got a picture of it
here. Now, this is...

322
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,838
Well, you remember
the last GT they did.

323
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:02,409
That was just an homage,
really, to the old GT40.

324
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,212
This one, they say,
is actually a racing car
on the road.

325
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,014
It's got a twin-turbo,
3.5 litre V6,

326
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,882
seven-speed
flappy-paddle box,

327
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,384
more than 600 horsepower.

328
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:15,688
The problem is, though,
I can't think of any
racing car

329
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,057
that works on the road,
really, ever.

330
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,392
No, they don't.

331
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,395
I mean, the Nissan GTR:
fabulous, fabulous car.

332
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:25,665
rubbish.
It's undriveable.

333
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,133
You know,
it's a very good point,

334
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,701
because a racing car
on the road

335
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,338
is a bit like trying to play
tennis with a cricket bat.

336
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,672
It's technically possible...

337
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,574
Two totally different
disciplines.

338
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,644
The only trouble is,
that looks so good,
I do find myself going...

339
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:42,148
Mm. You erm... You bought
the last GT, didn't you?

340
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,750
Yes.

341
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,985
Thank you for reminding me,
Hammond. Yes, I did.

342
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,520
-Did that go well for you?
-No, it didn't.

343
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,422
-Oh, did it not?
-No, it didn't.

344
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:52,024
The problem was
the insurance company said it
had to have a burglar alarm,

345
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:56,529
which blew usually when
my daughter was doing the
school play and ruined it,

346
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,265
and it had to have a tracker.

347
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:01,901
And there is nothing
on God's earth more
annoying than a tracker.

348
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,936
But I've got a tracker.
It doesn't bother me
in the slightest.

349
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,072
No, that's because you'll have
a little special place

350
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,140
on your hall table
with a pencil outline.

351
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,344
"I've got my keys
and must remember
to take my tracker."

352
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,079
Because you're organised
and I'm not.

353
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,715
One for your tracker,
for your keys, one for
your little penknife.

354
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,784
One for some change
in case you need it.

355
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,720
-Yeah, with 10ps and 2ps.
-And a tiny screwdriver
for mending your glasses.

356
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,689
-He will. Oh, he will.
-No, I won't.

357
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,557
No, it lives in a--
It just has a little pouch.

358
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,725
You just
hang it on the hook.

359
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,560
-Oh, does it?
-You've got a pouch?

360
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,729
He's got a pouch
for his tracker.

361
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,464
Especially for the tracker?

362
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,500
-Well, yeah, because...
-What's it made of?

363
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,035
-Well, leather, I suppose.
-A little leather pouch.

364
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,470
Did you make it yourself?

365
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,272
-No, it came...
-A little leather pouch.

366
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,374
It came with the car,
believe it or not.

367
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,410
Oh, so Ferrari
sold it to you.

368
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,512
Was it £600?
I bet it was.

369
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,347
No, it just
came with the car!

370
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,981
I don't think Ferrari
give it away!

371
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,517
The stripes
on your Ferrari, OK?

372
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,184
Two stripes,
a bit like on that Ford.

373
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,687
There are two stripes.
How much did you pay
for those stripes?

374
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,189
Well, they were an option.
They were £6,000.

375
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,329
Look. Listen, this is why
I drive a Golf GTI, OK?

376
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,397
Because you
don't need an alarm,
you don't need a tracker,

377
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:08,401
and it's five insurance
groups lower down than
the previous Golf GTI level.

378
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,936
-Wow!
-It is!

379
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,572
- It's because
you can't crash it.

380
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:16,175
I bet I could.

381
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:21,881
Anyway, have you two seen
those new pedestrian traffic
lights in Trafalgar Square?

382
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,084
Which, if you're watching
America, is in London,
which is in Britain.

383
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,786
Are these... Yes.

384
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:30,156
These are the ones that have
got the two blokes on them,
isn't it?

385
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,024
James, don't be sexist!

386
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,361
-Why is that...?
-No, because what
if you're a lesbian?

387
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,263
- Well, you would put
two women on it.

388
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:39,098
Well, then
what if you're straight?

389
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,701
-A man and a woman?
-But traffic lights
are only this big.

390
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,903
You can't have a man
and a man, a man and a woman,

391
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,606
a man who isn't sure,
and a woman and a woman--

392
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:50,810
What if... What if you
just want to cross the road?

393
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:54,146
What... It's like being
in the '70s with you two!

394
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:58,518
Crossing the road is now
an opportunity for you
to express your sexuality.

395
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:02,555
It is. That's why they've
come up with these traffic
lights in London.

396
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:04,023
What are they for?

397
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,892
No, they really have.
They really have.

398
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,927
- They're real?
- They are for real.

399
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,096
What's that one
on the right, then?

400
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,264
Hello! Transgender.

401
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,468
What?
So, hang on, only tran...

402
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,404
- Yeah.
- What?

403
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:19,539
Transgender traffic lights.

404
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:22,108
- I didn't know that.
- So only...

405
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,011
Only transgender people
can cross when that's green?

406
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,312
No!

407
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:28,047
When it goes red,
does that mean

408
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:29,516
it's not OK
to be transgender?

409
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,551
That's a good point.

410
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,152
I don't know what happens
when it goes red.

411
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,788
No way they're gonna say,
"It's not a..." I don't know.

412
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,425
And what has any of this got
to do with crossing the road?

413
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,694
That's all you want to do.
It's nothing to do with
expressing your sexuality.

414
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,696
It's the wrong time.
I want to cross the road.

415
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,331
All I want to do
at that point

416
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:47,266
is work out how to go
to the other side.

417
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,901
And by that I don't mean...

418
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,871
No. I don't...

419
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,441
I mean...

420
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,610
...of the road.

421
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:59,446
Maybe you're right, it is.

422
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,781
Right, now,
can I talk about Alfa Romeo?

423
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,315
- No.
- Why?

424
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,184
Because we have to
introduce our next film.

425
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,954
Now, as we know, in recent
years the world's carmakers

426
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,723
have made great strides
to make more fuel-efficient

427
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,460
and environmentally-friendly
car engines,

428
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,161
but very little has been
done to make more

429
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,465
environmentally-friendly
car bodies and interiors.

430
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:21,834
Yeah, by and large,
they are still made
of steel and plastic,

431
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,036
and that consumes
a huge amount of energy.

432
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:28,708
So we had an idea. Are there
more sustainable materials
that could be used instead?

433
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:32,645
Well, to find out,
each of us bought
a Land Rover Discovery.

434
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:34,881
We then removed
its metal body

435
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:39,251
and replaced it
with whatever we thought
was the best solution

436
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,521
for the future of the planet.

437
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,760
The meeting point
was in Wales,

438
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,196
and I was the first
to arrive,

439
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,499
in a car made from mud.

440
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,306
But, sadly,
before I had the chance to
tell you anything about it,

441
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,674
Hammond arrived.

442
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,984
Oh, yeah.
Let me talk you through this.

443
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:15,822
What I've done, I've built
a frame out of hazel,

444
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,558
through which I have weaved
English flowers and shrubs.

445
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,292
It's basically a hedgerow.

446
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,529
Better still, it is growing,
because I've planted them

447
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:25,865
so it's got compost
and soil to provide
the nutrients required

448
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,034
to let my car
flourish and bloom.

449
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,870
You don't... You don't wash
this car, you water it.

450
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:33,573
It's alive.
It's brilliant, isn't it?

451
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,175
-Clematis?
-No, it's cleared up.

452
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:40,012
-Have you become a hippie?
-No, but I can feel it
starting inside me.

453
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,548
-What have you done?
-Well...

454
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,616
Sadly,
before I could tell him,

455
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:46,218
Jeremy arrived...
in a snuff movie.

456
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,930
Gentlemen,
I can see what's happened.
Wha...

457
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:02,769
You're speechless, because
all the words in your head

458
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,573
have been sucked out by
the magnetism of my genius.

459
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:10,042
A car made from
bone and skin.

460
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,411
- What bones?
- Animal bones.

461
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:15,381
Bones are no good for this.
You can't use bones
to make cars.

462
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,985
Why not? When your dog dies,
what do you do now?
You bury it.

463
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,187
-I don't turn her into
a boot lid!
-Why not?

464
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,656
Because I don't want
to see a little face
stretched across--

465
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,593
You don't have the face!
I haven't got a face on it.

466
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:27,927
It's just the bones.

467
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:30,329
So as Granny gets older,
does the family sit around

468
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,699
planning a new
little hatchback?

469
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,166
Now, I hadn't
thought of people.

470
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,468
There's not a lot
of dignity in it, is there?

471
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,237
Have you used ears
for wing mirrors?

472
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,672
-Yes.
-You're sick!

473
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:41,941
Why would you not do that?
They're designed for that.

474
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,443
-No, they're not.
-Well, they are.

475
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:48,981
-They're not reflective.
-They absorb information and
pass it on to the creature.

476
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,750
-Look at my windscreen.
-What is that?

477
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:52,885
It's...
the digestive system -

478
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,622
well, part of the digestive
system - of an cow.

479
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:56,989
What part
of the digestive system?

480
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,125
- Its stomach lining.
- Not its stomach lining.

481
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,993
-Well, where? Further back?
-Yes.

482
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,796
Are you staring at the world
through a cow's ring?

483
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,067
It is its anal passage.

484
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:12,538
But it's stretched so thin
that it's completely
transparent.

485
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,373
Cow's arse, horse's arse.
It's perfect!

486
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,211
Come on! It's a lot better
than what you two have done,
which is nothing.

487
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,948
-What's this made out of?
-Have a guess.
-Is it mud?

488
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,650
It's mud. It's a mud car.

489
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,351
-You've got flat tyres.
-No, they're not flat.

490
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,987
They're pumped up
as high as they will go
without exploding.

491
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,956
-How much does it weigh?
-Quite a lot.

492
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,390
-How much?
-Yeah, loads.

493
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,125
How much does it weigh,
James?

494
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,761
-What units would you like?
-Tonnes.

495
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,462
Five.

496
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:40,366
-Five tonnes?
Well, that's just idiotic.
-Well, mud is quite heavy.

497
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,670
-This looks safe.
-It's sustainable, is that.
That is growing.

498
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:47,239
While we've been having
that conversation, this has
extended a little bit.

499
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,408
-It just grows quietly.
-Is it actually a living car?

500
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:52,912
Everything's planted.
I've put bulbs along here,
ready for spring. Daffodils.

501
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,682
-Not safe, though, is it?
-Yes. Hazel, very strong.

502
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:59,786
It's not as strong as bone.
Bone is three times stronger
than steel.

503
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,220
Is it?

504
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,223
Oh. Sorry, text.

505
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,792
Mr Wilman.

506
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:09,762
"Having built your cars
from nature, you will now
drive through it,

507
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,263
to the Myarth Hill,

508
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,867
where you will take part in
a green motorsport event."

509
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:17,704
-What green motorsport event?
-He doesn't say.

510
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:21,908
A motorsport event
that is presumably
ecological in some way.

511
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:22,975
OK.

512
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,911
Before setting off,

513
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,613
we consulted a map to see
where we were going.

514
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:30,116
Right, so that's the UK.

515
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,985
We're here,
and we've got to get to here.

516
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:38,290
Well... that doesn't look
like too much of a challenge.

517
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,493
With that sorted,
we saddled up

518
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,331
and began
our epic 11-mile journey.

519
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:47,834
Look at the smoke!

520
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,501
That's ecological.

521
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:53,339
Greenpeace are gonna be
ringing him up at any moment.

522
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,107
Tremendous.

523
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,777
Smells of nature,
I'm in nature,

524
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,246
I'm made of nature.

525
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:05,184
It's not quick,
but it gives me more time
to enjoy God's creation,

526
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,987
of which
I am very much a part.

527
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:10,022
Oh!

528
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,359
James!

529
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:21,801
We've done ten seconds,
and James...

530
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:25,905
I may be losing one of my -
I think the correct technical
term is the A-pillar.

531
00:28:25,972 --> 00:28:27,807
Now it's gone completely.

532
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:32,945
Oh, dear!

533
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:38,384
Surely
he has to admit defeat?

534
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,586
There's not
much car left now.

535
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,522
Oh, dear, James.

536
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,091
I think we can count you out.

537
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,525
-But it doesn't matter.
-What doesn't matter?

538
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,861
Look. You think, "Oh, James's
car's falling apart."

539
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:52,965
I'm standing in my
spare-parts department.
All of it.

540
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,633
Can be used
to rebuild your car?

541
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,270
-It's right under there, mud.
-So it's as good as new?
-Sort of.

542
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,974
Well, I'm sorry,
but we're gonna set off
and leave you behind.

543
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,509
Well, hang on.
You can't leave me behind

544
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,644
because we haven't started.
We're still in the field.

545
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:06,946
- Oh, yes.
- Good point. OK, well,

546
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:09,448
we're gonna set off
and go to the pub.

547
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:11,383
-That's a very good idea.
-While you...

548
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,286
-While you...
-...find some mud.

549
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,823
I've lost my car!
Oh, it's there. It's there.

550
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,359
With Bob The Builder
out of the way,

551
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,561
Richard and I
settled down to appreciate

552
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:27,266
the planet-saving nature of
our revolutionary eco-cars.

553
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,536
You may be...

554
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,038
amused by my bodywork,

555
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,273
or perhaps horrified,

556
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,078
but the fact is that
making steel bodies for cars

557
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:45,384
produces 120 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide every year.

558
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,854
120 million tonnes!

559
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,891
Carmakers
will sort out clean,

560
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,626
environmentally-friendly
engines. They will.

561
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:59,231
But in the meantime, I can
tell you that the CO2
produced by this car's engine

562
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:03,035
is being absorbed
and used by the bodywork.

563
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,573
Plants breathe in
carbon dioxide
and breathe out oxygen.

564
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,910
That's what my car's body
is doing right now.

565
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:16,916
Jumpers, Sunday lunch...
spare parts.

566
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,785
You don't need
a foundry or a furnace

567
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,453
to build the body
for this car.

568
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,091
You just need animals
to make love to one another.

569
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,895
That's what this car is
really. It's a sex machine.

570
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,934
Meanwhile, back at base,
James was having a rethink.

571
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,103
I've decided to abandon
my original idea

572
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,605
because it was just
too weak and too floppy,

573
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,975
and instead I'm going to
build a car out of bricks.

574
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,911
The basic materials
for making the bricks

575
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,947
are fresh mud
with a bit of water in it,

576
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:51,517
er... some straw
to give it strength,

577
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,385
and some sheep poo.

578
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,955
You then use that
to make the brick shape,

579
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,723
and then you fire those
in a kiln.

580
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,259
Then you use the bricks to
build the thing like a house.

581
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:03,362
Except, of course, it will be
roughly the shape of a car.

582
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:10,236
Back on the road,
Hammond had called
our eco convoy to a halt.

583
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:12,704
-What's the matter?
-Shh.

584
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:13,973
Shush what?

585
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,641
There's a bustle
in my hedgerow.

586
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:19,545
Well, don't be alarmed now.

587
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:24,450
-It's probably just a...
spring clean.
-What, for the May Queen?

588
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,954
As it turned out,
I'd picked up a passenger.

589
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,023
Hold on. There! Look!

590
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,591
Oh! It's a hedgehog!

591
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,326
Yeah! He's moved in.

592
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,697
Do hedgehogs have bones?
He could be a door mirror.

593
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:41,533
He's now a member of
my little community in here.

594
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,402
You're not using him
to make a door mirror.

595
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,604
-No, but when he dies--
-He lives here!

596
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,173
Hedgehogs die.

597
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,330
Oh, he's got a mouse
in his little bird box.

598
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:15,001
And it's got the biggest
testes I've ever seen!

599
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,272
Eventually, Richard and I
arrived at the pub.

600
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,512
Oh, hello!
Oh, mate! You fool!

601
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,648
Oh! Oh, look.

602
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:32,084
Clean break.
That'll never...
You're gonna need pins.

603
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:35,254
Shut up! Your car's
given me hay fever.

604
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:36,788
I can't see through my eyes.

605
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,258
Oh, so you crashed your car
because mine's got flowers on

606
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:43,062
and not because you built
your windscreen out of
a cow's balloon knot?

607
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:46,265
Let's not get bogged down
with who caused the accident,
cos it was you.

608
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,334
I am now gonna go
and get some spare parts.

609
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,701
Of course you are.
That'll be easy.

610
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,670
Maybe there'll be a nice zoo
in this tiny village.

611
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,405
No, hospital.
Old folks' home.

612
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,042
You could wait--
Just find one of those
old ladies with...

613
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,345
Back at the start point,

614
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,414
the eco-warrior was
ramping up the pace.

615
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:23,435
Watch that go.

616
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,339
Meanwhile, back at the pub,

617
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:30,609
I was repairing
my damaged front end.

618
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:34,080
Well, annoyingly,
the pork that I bought

619
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,714
is sort of triangular
and doesn't look right.

620
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:38,284
It doesn't really fit,
so I've got a side of beef,

621
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,152
which I think will be great.

622
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:42,488
Now, I'm just erm...
clearing away the old bone.

623
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:53,132
No, shoo! Shoo in Welsh.

624
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,302
I'm warning you.

625
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,105
How would you like to be
a petrol filler cap?

626
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,510
What do you think?

627
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,278
I actually think it
looks rather stylish,

628
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:10,216
because it immediately looks
ecological, recyclable,

629
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,318
sustainable -
all those things.

630
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,121
You get a single-skin
brick wall.

631
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,556
It builds up very neatly,
as you can see.

632
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:20,292
It is exactly the same as
making something out of Lego.

633
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:22,128
If you have lots of Lego...

634
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,670
Right.

635
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:35,874
Clearly,
James was not going to get
his car built that day,

636
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:40,779
so Richard and I decided to
spend the night at the pub.

637
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,748
How far have we come today?
Just remind me.

638
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,383
We're still in the same
field where we started.

639
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,017
-Well, he is.
-Yes.

640
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:49,621
-We're in a pub.
- But we have to go back
to the start to start.

641
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,259
-It's not the best start.
-No.

642
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,194
-Erm...
-How do we know?
We haven't started yet.

643
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:59,565
Precisely, so, actually,
it might yet be a brilliant
start when the start starts.

644
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,671
Ow!

645
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,980
His one was useless.
It's his slap-happy attitude
to making things.

646
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,982
Attention to detail.

647
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,350
Thank you very much.

648
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:22,188
Anyway, now it is time
for Celebrity Brain Crash!

649
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,062
Now, last week...

650
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:32,898
Last week,
as I'm sure you'll remember,

651
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:37,636
our guest Simon Pegg
sadly fell into
the harbour and drowned.

652
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:40,639
Er... But there's no danger
of that happening this week,

653
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:44,376
because our guest is actually
starting in the harbour.

654
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:47,279
He is one of Britain's
top comedians

655
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:49,648
and a jet-ski enthusiast.

656
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:53,752
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Jimmy Carr!

657
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:57,223
Here he comes now, look,
on the screen...

658
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:59,325
and he's looking good!

659
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:02,328
He is.
What are we going to
ask him when he gets here?

660
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:05,231
I'm gonna ask him, actually,
about erm...

661
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,333
that story he told me
once when we were on holiday.

662
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,235
No, you can't ask
him about that on air.

663
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:10,669
Ofcom, they won't like it.

664
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,571
Why does Ofcom...
We're on the internet.

665
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:15,307
Yeah, but we're
still broadcast.
You can't tell that story.

666
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:18,944
Whoa! Hang on! Hang on!

667
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,380
I don't want to interrupt.
He's come in very hot.

668
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:24,983
No, what's this boat doing?
Shush, everyone! Shush!

669
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,252
The boat! Stop the...

670
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:27,753
Oh, for God's sake! The boat!

671
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,258
Oh, my God.

672
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:52,744
As you may have noticed,
the audience there applauding
the tragic death...

673
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,284
...of one of Britain's
best-loved comedians,
Jimmy Carr.

674
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:02,053
Does that mean
he's not coming on, then?

675
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,290
Well, James, he's burst

676
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:07,559
and is now basically chum
on the waters of the harbour,

677
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,528
so that's a no,
he's not coming on.

678
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,530
This is a dis...
It's awkward.

679
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:14,300
-It's every single week.
-We're getting a reputation.
People are gonna notice.

680
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:20,205
It's OK, though. I've just
thought of something else
we can do to fill the time.

681
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:21,540
You... You know what it is.

682
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,775
-You go outside, and you.
-Do I have to do this?

683
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,677
Yes, I'm afraid you do.
Could you go that way?

684
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,679
Go get it. Quickly, quickly.
Run, run, run.

685
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,748
Ladies and gentlemen,

686
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:33,852
please try not to look at
the hideous bloodstained
water out of the window.

687
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,323
You see, the thing is...
The thing is

688
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:40,392
that when immigrants try
to get into the country,

689
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,728
they always come in the back
of a container lorry,

690
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:46,398
and I always think that is
the world's worst game
of hide-and-seek.

691
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:49,401
Cos if you work for
Homeland Security...
No, what's it called here?

692
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:53,472
Border Force? ...Border
Force, you open the doors
and, "Well, there you are."

693
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:59,345
So I was thinking,
surely there must be a better
way of getting into Britain?

694
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:02,147
And I think
I've worked it out.

695
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:05,116
- So, James,
could you bring the car in?
Yes.

696
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,518
Yes, good man.

697
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:07,719
Right, here he comes now,

698
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,489
at his usual top speed
of eight,

699
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:14,025
in what is
an Audi TT Quattro.

700
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:17,429
That's perfect. Thank you
so much, James.
If you'd like to step out.

701
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:21,433
Now, Richard Hammond
is in this car.

702
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:27,105
And I'm going to give you,
the studio audience,
one hour to find him.

703
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:29,107
Oh, not an hour!

704
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:32,778
All right, not an hour.
A minute. I'll give you
60 seconds to find him.

705
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,113
Help yourselves, everybody.
See if you can find him.

706
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,449
- Open the bonnet.
- Look in the ashtray!

707
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:40,652
Look in the ashtray?
He's small, but he's not
that small.

708
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,422
- Open the boot.
- Inside the seat.

709
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,723
"Inside the seat."

710
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,658
He's strapped underneath.
He's underneath.

711
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:48,927
- Have a look.
- I'll get down.

712
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,729
If you just
go down there, you can
have a look underneath.

713
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:52,864
Has anyone lifted this?

714
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,200
Three, two, one...

715
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,502
No, you've all failed.

716
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,404
You'd be no good
in Immigration.

717
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:03,742
Right, go back
to where you were, because,
ladies and gentlemen,

718
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:06,645
what we are going to do now
is reveal to you

719
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:10,315
where Richard Hammond
was concealed in this car.

720
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:12,250
James,
could you give me a hand?

721
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:14,853
-Certainly.
-Okey-doke.

722
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,422
- Hello!
- There he is.

723
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:20,058
Hello! I'm in the car. Yeah.

724
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:24,896
Are you all right?

725
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,798
Yeah. Can I get out now?

726
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,235
The amazing thing is,
it's not just Audi TTs.

727
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,071
Almost any car
has that much space

728
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:35,441
if you want to do
a spot of people smuggling.

729
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,909
Yeah, it's not that much
space, just to be clear.

730
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,545
Can I get out now?

731
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,648
No, because I've just
thought of something.

732
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,450
No, seriously. James, could
you pop the bumper back on?

733
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,051
-What?
-No, move your feet.

734
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,687
-No, because--
-It's not very nice!

735
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:51,757
Is it not? Right, so,
pop that back on there.

736
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,359
Now, what we've
got here, I think,

737
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,763
is a really rather
effective parking sensor.

738
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:01,633
What?
I don't like this!
- I like it. I like it.

739
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,636
You get back in. We'll bring
a car in so that...

740
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,772
Yeah, so you've got
something to reverse up to.

741
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,874
I need to drill some holes
for your eyes.

742
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,410
- You bloody don't!

743
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:15,547
Seriously, Hammond,
you won't be able to see
anything unless I do.

744
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:18,650
-Where are your eyes?
About here?
-At the front of my head!

745
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,786
Right, close them, Hammond.
This...

746
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,963
-Hammond?
-I'm not talking to you!

747
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,901
Right, I'll do one
for your other eye.

748
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,939
There. Can you see out now?

749
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:43,809
Yes, there. Look.
Can you see?

750
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:47,112
We can see his little eyes.
That's lovely.
If someone holds this.

751
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,815
Right, James, if you'd like
to start reversing,

752
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:53,284
keeping your ears open for
Hammond's pitiable screams.

753
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,753
Roger.

754
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,288
No...
No! No! Just stop!

755
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:59,057
No! Stop!

756
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,893
- How far away is that?
- About 15 feet.

757
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,395
- What?
- Hammond?

758
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,064
- What?
- We live in London.

759
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,200
- You could build a £4 million
house in that gap.

760
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,236
I need to know when
you're half an inch away.

761
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:14,172
You're not the one
in the bloody bumper!

762
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,141
-Right, come on, then, James.
-Here we go.

763
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,544
Hammond, you're on silence
till it's dangerous.

764
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,251
Stop!

765
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,556
That is absolutely brilliant.

766
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,625
That's like
a quarter of an inch.

767
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,195
Look at that.

768
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:38,263
Cor!

769
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,768
The thing is, parking sensors
are very expensive.

770
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,970
You can rent a man
for almost nothing.

771
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:48,306
Yeah, look, I don't know
how much you pay
to rent a man normally,

772
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,241
but I cost more.

773
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,210
Now, get me out of here,
please.

774
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:54,980
Well, no, because we've got
to link into the next film.

775
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,448
We can't get you out anyway

776
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,217
because you're too close;
we'll never get the bumper off.

777
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:02,220
- You're too good
at your job, Hammond.
Oh, God!

778
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,389
That's what's happened.
So we're going back...

779
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,893
Actually, it's part two,
isn't it? What was the film?

780
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,095
It was Italy.
No, that was last week.

781
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:13,599
- Oh, the cars!
- Oh, really?

782
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:17,703
-Oh, the sustainable thing.
-Sustainable cars. So...
-Yes.

783
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:22,841
Get on with it!

784
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:28,614
The following morning
we were up bright and early

785
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:31,016
so we could get back
to the start line.

786
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,988
-Not a bad night, actually.
-It was all right.

787
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,156
Oh, hello.

788
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:41,860
May?

789
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,198
Oh! That's dogs and foxes
and things, isn't it?

790
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,701
Dogs have come
and eaten your car.

791
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:51,803
They haven't eaten
it, they've destroyed it,

792
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,706
which means I've got to
put it back together again.

793
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,177
There are some spare parts
up there.

794
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,346
Yeah, I think that
horse is looking very ill.

795
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,881
It's got a very grey face.

796
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:04,650
That's always a sign
of looking ill.

797
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,818
Is your horse ill?

798
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:08,053
-No.
-No?

799
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,221
-No
-He'll last the day, then?

800
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:11,322
Yeah.

801
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,292
Damn it.

802
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,865
It took all morning
to repair my car

803
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:21,767
with stuff from
the butcher's shop,

804
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,434
which meant it was lunchtime

805
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:25,003
before we were
on our way back

806
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,105
to see how James
was getting on.

807
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:31,977
Jeremy, what's all that smoke
up ahead there?

808
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,713
What smoke?

809
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,749
That massive ball of smoke
in front of us, up front.

810
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:39,818
I can't see it.
My hay fever's really bad.

811
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:42,187
No, you can't see it because
you're trying to looking at it

812
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:44,856
through a cow's butt hole.

813
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:47,759
As it turned out,
the smoke was on account

814
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:53,364
of James having
single-handedly restarted
the Industrial Revolution.

815
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:01,707
What?

816
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,408
-What are you doing?
-I'm making...

817
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:12,483
The theory is...
we are reducing our impact
on the environment,

818
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,584
but you've dug it up!

819
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:14,953
It's not where anybody lives.

820
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,722
It's just the countryside.
It's not doing anything.

821
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,223
Is that a coal lorry?

822
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:22,027
-Yes.
-The least environmental
thing on the entire earth.

823
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,730
It's a lorry delivering coal.

824
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:27,032
-So?
-Why do you need coal?

825
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:29,000
-To fire up the kiln.
-What?

826
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,369
The bricks have to be baked.
You can't just--

827
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:35,440
-Hold on. So you're making
a car out of mud bricks?
-Yes.

828
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,944
Are you gonna dig a canal
network to get in and out,
perhaps, with your coal?

829
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,379
-That's quite a good idea.
-It isn't a good idea!

830
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:45,283
Much
ruined countryside later,

831
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,987
James's new car
was finally ready.

832
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:51,823
Why are you dressed up
like an American footballer?

833
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,925
Well, it's a prototype,

834
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:55,994
and I'm a test pilot,
in effect.

835
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:58,329
Test pilots wear
specialist equipment.

836
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,766
But that looks
perfectly solid to me.

837
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:03,769
That roof is...

838
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:06,872
James, even given
the limitations of the
material you've used,

839
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:08,206
your car looks crap.

840
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,141
But look how it blends in
with the environment.

841
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,376
Prince Charles
would love this.

842
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,978
It doesn't blend in
with anything.

843
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,781
There's no environment left -
you've dug it all up.

844
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:18,649
- Right, can we finally go?
- Yes, you can.

845
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:20,218
11 miles lie ahead.

846
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:22,320
See you there.

847
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:27,292
Ow!

848
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:36,301
That is a complete
mystery, to be honest.

849
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:37,903
It's not.

850
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,471
It had an arched roof,
it had a keystone.

851
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:42,640
There must be something
wrong with that mortar.

852
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:46,477
Waiting for James
to mend his bodywork, again,

853
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:50,148
meant my bodywork
started to go off.

854
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:54,485
But, eventually,
he was ready.

855
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:02,093
It's really rather pleasant.

856
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,130
This is like being at home
with the windows open.

857
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:09,100
Richard, meanwhile,
had added some floral
go-faster stripes,

858
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:13,371
and I'd opened up
my cow's rectum
to improve the ventilation.

859
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,176
We have had a few problems.

860
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:21,913
We've only covered, yes,
two miles in two days,

861
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,015
but here we are,

862
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,852
as a threesome, going along.

863
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:34,125
But then...

864
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:36,227
It's a river,
and not a small one.

865
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,234
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

866
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:49,507
Oh, God.

867
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:52,577
-Oh, your bricks
have fallen off, mate.
-Your bonnet's fallen off.

868
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,546
Perfectly all right.
Redundancy's built into it.

869
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:57,615
-Is it?
-Yeah.

870
00:46:57,682 --> 00:47:00,051
Since Richard
is the team bumpkin,

871
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:02,587
we decided
he should go first.

872
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:07,658
OK, well,
my community of people,
make for higher ground.

873
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:09,560
Just climb.

874
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:13,331
Hammond's ark made it
to the other side safely.

875
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:15,133
Yeah!

876
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,068
And then it was my go.

877
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:20,438
I'm really deep here.

878
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:21,940
Really, really deep.

879
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,209
Oh, no! Cows leak!

880
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,577
That's a terrible thing
to learn!

881
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:31,149
However, I, too, made it
with relative ease.

882
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:33,151
Eat my meat, Hammond!

883
00:47:34,152 --> 00:47:35,921
But then...

884
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:37,655
Look at this.

885
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:39,024
Tragic.

886
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,827
An old man driving a low
garden wall into a river.

887
00:47:42,928 --> 00:47:45,997
Let's look on the bright side.
If this doesn't work
as a car,

888
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:48,099
it will be very effective
as a dam.

889
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,472
He's not doing it
quite as quickly as
you or I did it.

890
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,574
Nor as aggressively,
nor as purposefully.

891
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,412
His car is also riding a lot
lower than ours because
it weighs so much.

892
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:04,182
I was getting very deep.
It may be leaking slightly.

893
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,419
It's leaking a lot.

894
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:13,391
Cack.
Chaps, I think I'm beached.

895
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:16,094
I'm being honest,
there's not a great deal
we can do about it.

896
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:18,029
You're in the river,
we're here.

897
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:20,966
Right, if I go right a bit,

898
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:23,568
I should... clear that...

899
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,603
Oh, yes!

900
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,506
-Oh, the...
-The side's just come off.
-Yeah, that's...

901
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,576
So the mortar's dissolving
and the bricks
are just falling off.

902
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,044
Yes.

903
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:36,347
That's more gone.

904
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,050
Oh, God!
The mortar's dissolving!

905
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:41,686
He's just transporting
his own cameras along.

906
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,221
That's all he's doing.

907
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:44,422
Get off!

908
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,159
Get off!

909
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:50,561
Little spindly arms
throwing a brick.

910
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:54,199
Help!

911
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,536
We're gonna have to put him
out of his misery.

912
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:02,173
We'll just
abandon him.
Do you think?

913
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,708
What is the point of him?

914
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,376
James, can you hear me?

915
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,479
We've analysed the situation
and there is literally

916
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,615
nothing we can do to help.
Nothing.

917
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:14,685
Leaving James
in his dissolving car,

918
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:18,623
we headed off to make camp
and get supper underway.

919
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,360
Well, apart from your
rather tragic tents,

920
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:26,164
-this isn't so bad.
-It's all right.

921
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:27,765
It is amazing, isn't it?

922
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:31,202
My car, the way it disappears
into that hedge,

923
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:34,305
it's not just camouflage,
it is hedge.

924
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:36,141
-It's gone.
-No, it is genuinely...

925
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:39,710
Actually, I will agree,
yours is remarkable.

926
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,582
Meanwhile, James's car
had shed so much weight

927
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,152
that he was able
to get free...

928
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:52,423
and start raping
the countryside again
to rebuild it.

929
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,424
Bastards.

930
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:55,560
Bastards.

931
00:49:57,595 --> 00:50:00,365
You know, what's incredible
about this -

932
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:03,034
this sustainable living
we're doing -

933
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:03,068
this sustainable living
we're doing -
is our barbecue is made
from bricks from James's car,

934
00:50:03,068 --> 00:50:07,272
is our barbecue is made
from bricks from James's car,

935
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,575
the kindling and the
vegetables are from your car.

936
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:13,744
Are you about
to tell me I'm eating...

937
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:15,346
Back wing.

938
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:22,087
-What?
-When you buy a steak,
it says "keep refrigerated".

939
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:24,322
It doesn't say, "Stick
to the side of your car,

940
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,324
leave in the sun,
then drive through a river."

941
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:32,630
Whoa!

942
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,313
James is making
such a racket, isn't he?

943
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,981
It's worse than last time.

944
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:55,019
The difference on this trip,
while he's been
tearing nature apart,

945
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:57,488
I've never felt closer to it.

946
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,725
Well, he's just messing
everything up. He always...

947
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,233
Holy cow.

948
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,135
-Hammond.
-What?

949
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:12,737
That.

950
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:16,307
What are you doing?

951
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:18,209
He couldn't see it.
It's a hedge trimmer.

952
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:21,512
That's my community,
you rural bastard!

953
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:24,782
-Oh, my...
-Oh, God!

954
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:28,886
The next morning,
to cheer up Hammond

955
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:31,222
following the decimation
of his car

956
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:34,192
and his woodland
animal community,

957
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:35,626
I made breakfast.

958
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:38,796
-Eat it.
-No!

959
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:40,998
-Why not?
-Because it's going green!

960
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:42,267
It's just a bit of door.

961
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,535
You can see where the flies
have been on it.

962
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,570
It's disgusting.

963
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,605
Hello. Hello!

964
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:48,539
What...?

965
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,742
-It's a dung heap.
-It is a dung heap.

966
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,981
-Morning.
-Morning.

967
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,749
Is this a car? What is it?

968
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:03,020
It is a totally sustainable
car made of, effectively,
wattle and daub,

969
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:05,022
only the wattle
has been replaced by straw

970
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:06,957
and the daub has been
replaced by cow poo,

971
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:08,726
but the principle
is the same.

972
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,329
How the hell
do you fit in it?
- Only just.

973
00:52:11,396 --> 00:52:13,831
-Where's your windscreen?
-There.

974
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:14,765
Hang on.

975
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:18,603
Can we just test
your blind spots, James?

976
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,805
Can you see either of us now?

977
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,508
No.

978
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:26,311
Heavily pedestrianised areas
should be avoided.

979
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:32,217
-Right, come on. We've just
got two miles to go.
-Yes.

980
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:34,452
Jesus Christ!

981
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,120
The smell!

982
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:39,890
-What's that?
-It breaks my heart, but
it's a small gift for you.

983
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:44,128
-Is it? Mate!
-Yes, from me and my
woodland community.

984
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:45,463
Oh!

985
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,132
-It's a dead bat!
-Yeah, it is.

986
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:50,901
-Bats have sonar, don't they?
-Yeah.

987
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:54,038
So I could use it as a
reversing parking sensor.

988
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,674
Yeah, I don't think it works
once the bat is dead.

989
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:01,546
And so,
with all of us running...

990
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:08,052
My reversing bat
is working well.

991
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:12,490
...we began
the final two-mile leg
of our epic journey.

992
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:15,560
Oh, balls!

993
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:19,264
There are some issues
associated with
environmentalism,

994
00:53:19,264 --> 00:53:21,832
and we're seeing
one of them right now.

995
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:31,276
-Am I anywhere near the gate?
-Oh, God!

996
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:39,317
James attempted to tie
his car back together
using a ball of string...

997
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:40,751
which went well.

998
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,589
It's going...

999
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:49,294
Oh, that's gonna
confuse him now!

1000
00:53:49,294 --> 00:53:52,630
Why'd they make it in a ball
shape? What a stupid idea!

1001
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:57,602
But eventually it was done
and we were on our way.

1002
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:02,507
James,
how much does it weigh now?

1003
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:06,877
I'm gonna say the weight
has gone down a bit. I think
I'm down to three tonnes.

1004
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:09,013
So you still need
an HGV licence?

1005
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,317
But it's not a type of car
known to the DVLA.

1006
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:17,555
Mind you,
I had even bigger problems.

1007
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:20,725
My car was starting
to smell really bad.

1008
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:23,628
One of the sound recordists

1009
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,496
just came to fiddle
with my microphone,

1010
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:27,031
and actually was sick.

1011
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:32,470
Eventually, though, our
destination hoved into view.

1012
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:37,542
After
three days gruelling travel

1013
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:40,345
over 11 miles, we're here.

1014
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,814
This must be it.

1015
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:48,018
It was the Inaugural
Sustainable Living
Motorsport Challenge

1016
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:51,789
on a track carved out of
nature itself.

1017
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,759
Oh, hang on.

1018
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:58,228
-A text message.
-What?

1019
00:54:58,363 --> 00:54:59,630
I've got a text
here from Mr Wilman,

1020
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:01,599
with the instructions
of what we're doing.

1021
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:05,736
"Whoever does the most laps
in one hour wins."

1022
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,672
Oh, well, James,
that's not gonna be you.

1023
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:10,508
-Well, you don't know.
-No, I do know
it's not gonna be you.

1024
00:55:10,575 --> 00:55:12,910
Oh, no, wait. Hang on.
"You will be racing against

1025
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:15,746
three old-fashioned
steel cars."

1026
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:18,949
-Hang on. Yes, those.
-Hello.

1027
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:22,620
- Oh, there they are.
- How quaint.

1028
00:55:22,687 --> 00:55:24,722
No, they don't look
quaint. They look ridiculous.

1029
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:26,691
It's funny, that's
the nature of progress.

1030
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:29,059
- Suddenly, they look stupid.
- They do.

1031
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:35,433
The museum pieces were being
driven by three local yobbos.

1032
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,403
Right, this is it.

1033
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:42,473
The MeaTI, the TreeTI
and the PeaTI are ready.

1034
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:51,181
Oh, what a start!
It's a good start.

1035
00:55:51,248 --> 00:55:53,283
Yes, we're blocking!

1036
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:57,054
Oh, they've gone!
They've gone!
I couldn't see the flag.

1037
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:02,427
Yes, there are some hay
bales. I'll follow those.

1038
00:56:02,427 --> 00:56:05,029
Where the hell does it go
next?

1039
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,932
Despite the excellent start
from Richard and I,

1040
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:11,669
we were quickly overwhelmed
by the steel cars.

1041
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:14,505
And now the Golf's got past!

1042
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,908
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1043
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:20,445
I've let the Mondeo through.
That's a disaster!

1044
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:24,715
Oh, I've lost
one of my nose tampons!

1045
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:28,986
What Richard and I
really needed
was help from our colleague.

1046
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,456
Sadly, though...

1047
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:34,659
I'm gonna take
a racing line.
Oh, I'm completely lost.

1048
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:38,829
The trouble is,
the race track looks the same
as the front of the car.

1049
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,831
What a stupid idea
for an event.

1050
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,103
I've lost the other
nose tampon! Help!

1051
00:56:47,472 --> 00:56:49,607
I may have to pit
for another tampon.

1052
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,477
Where am I going?

1053
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,046
All right, James?

1054
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,347
No.

1055
00:56:57,482 --> 00:56:59,016
No time to lose.

1056
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:03,921
I've gone for
the super absorbent,

1057
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:06,557
slightly larger nose tampons,

1058
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:08,593
which I hope will last
a little longer.

1059
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,700
Given that we were in
an endurance race,

1060
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:19,003
our tactics so far
had been to protect our cars.

1061
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,808
Reliability,
that's what we need here.
That is everything.

1062
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:25,375
That's what matters most.

1063
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:29,079
But with the cars of the past
racking up so many laps,

1064
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:31,148
we had to get
the hammer down.

1065
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:35,520
The MeaTI
against the...

1066
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:39,890
whatever that is -
1.6 litre Golf.

1067
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,225
Yes!

1068
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,060
Yes! I've got him!

1069
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:47,231
Power sliding a hedge.

1070
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,999
Come on!

1071
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,540
Yes. Oh, yes.

1072
00:57:58,743 --> 00:58:00,811
I think I've done a lap.

1073
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:06,551
With us three - well, two -
making good progress,

1074
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:10,254
the cars from the past
started to play dirty.

1075
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:14,892
That is out of order!
They are getting violent!

1076
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:19,830
Oh! Oh, no!

1077
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:21,599
I've lost a tampon again!

1078
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,703
Who was that?

1079
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:26,937
Think you can mess with us

1080
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,706
just because we like
trees, do you?

1081
00:58:28,773 --> 00:58:31,776
That's out of order, mate.
You can't. Have that!

1082
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:40,718
The bone
is taking on the steel!

1083
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,255
Although
we were holding our own,

1084
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:49,193
the relentless pressure
started to take its toll
on our vehicles.

1085
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:55,232
I've lost
part of the hat.

1086
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,304
I can smell...

1087
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,939
What can I smell?

1088
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:05,643
Is that from the exhaust?

1089
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:10,014
With Hammond distracted
by the hot exhaust
burning his bodywork,

1090
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,282
it was all down
to my cow car.

1091
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:20,791
Good dicing here between
the past and the future.

1092
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:23,227
It's neck and neck!

1093
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,130
But then...

1094
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,632
Oh, no! No!

1095
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:29,900
Disaster!

1096
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:31,702
Oh, hell.
I think it looks like

1097
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:32,970
Jeremy's got trouble.

1098
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:36,641
How do you peel a cow?

1099
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:41,045
Having eventually got to
the overheating engine

1100
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:45,249
and seen it had become
a production line
for maggots...

1101
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,818
...I decided to go off
and be sick.

1102
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:56,160
Er... News from the Inaugural
Sustainable Motorsport Event

1103
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:58,562
On A Sustainable Track,
or whatever it's called,

1104
00:59:58,663 --> 01:00:02,032
Jeremy Clarkson has retired
with a maggot infestation.

1105
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:07,271
This meant
all our hopes rested
with Richard Hammond

1106
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:08,939
and his smouldering ark.

1107
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,678
Yeah, you ran wide!

1108
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,512
But then...

1109
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:16,881
Oh, my God!

1110
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,684
Oh, no!

1111
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:26,123
Oh, no! More news from the
Sustainable Motorsport
Challenge is that... Ow!

1112
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:29,326
...Richard Hammond,
I believe, is on fire.

1113
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:31,028
The garden centre is ablaze.

1114
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,132
Oh, God! Oh, no! Oh, no!

1115
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:38,803
That's gonna make it worse!

1116
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:43,007
With Hammond's car
on fire...

1117
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:48,445
mine alive, and James's
disintegrating again...

1118
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:50,147
Ow! Ow!

1119
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:54,251
...we decided that
environmentalism
simply doesn't work.

1120
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,055
And with that, back to--

1121
01:00:58,122 --> 01:01:00,290
And with that,
back to the tent.

1122
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,194
Holy crap!

1123
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,203
-No, it didn't work.
-No. So, there we are.

1124
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,107
There we are,
we've looked into it.

1125
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,575
We've looked into it
thoroughly,

1126
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:22,079
and I'm afraid
we're all doomed,
we're all gonna die.

1127
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:25,649
And on that terrible
disappointment,
I'm afraid it's time to end.

1128
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,251
See you next week. Goodbye!
